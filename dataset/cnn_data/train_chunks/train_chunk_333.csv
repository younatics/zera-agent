"(CNN) -- Kanye West wants his listeners to know that he is ""a close high"" to God. His latest album, ""Yeezus,"" released Tuesday, offered several controversial track titles, including ""New Slaves,"" ""Black Skinhead"" and the most audacious, ""I Am a God."" The track's credit says ""featuring God,"" as if He's just another artist -- a Rick Ross or Pharrell Williams -- stepping into the studio to spit a couple of verses. The song closes with the verses, ""I just talked to Jesus/he said, 'What up, Yeezus?'/I said ""S*** I'm chilling/trying to stack these millions'/I know he's the most high, but I am a close high."" Review: 'Yeezus' is Kanye West's darkest, most extreme album yet . So, does Kanye really think he's God's match? Some say the outspoken West is downright delusional, but Monica Miller, author of ""Religion and Hip Hop,"" thinks otherwise. The rap star's god-absorbed lyrics are a referral to his high status in the music industry, not a statement of religious beliefs, said Miller, an assistant professor of religious studies at Lewis & Clark College in Portland, Oregon. ""I don't think (this Christian theological language) is creating a religion,"" she said. ""He's using God to situate himself at the top of the game."" But Pastor C. Andre Grier of Lithonia, Georgia's Union Missionary Baptist Church, believes West has been wrong from the get-go. Religious people ""should want to be like Christ (in a humble way), follow Him, but any reference to equality means that you are wrong from the very beginning."" The beginning . Before the world knew West as an egotistical rapper, he was under the radar as a music engineer making beats for chart-topping artists such as Alicia Keys, Ludacris and Mos Def. He was brought into the spotlight after producing several tracks for Jay-Z's classic hip-hop album ""The Blueprint."" His first album, ""The College Dropout,"" dropped in February 2004, debuting at No. 2 on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart. It was met with immediate acclaim, with some critics suggesting that it was the best debut album ever released by a hip-hop artist. ""Jesus Walks"" was the album's third single and the world's introduction to West's religious beliefs. The song received praise from critics for its open conversation of faith in the secular rap community. The gospel-choir hook of ""Jesus walks"" flows over lyrics like, ""God, show me the way because the devil trying to break me down. ... The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now. ... And I don't think there is nothing I can do now to right my wrongs. ... I want to talk to God, but I'm afraid because we ain't spoke in so long."" Kanye West: 'People look at me like I'm Hitler' The fallen angel . West could be forgiven for feeling touched to even be in a position to drop a record after a near-fatal head-on car collision required him to undergo facial reconstruction surgery and have his jaw wired shut. In interviews after the accident, West credited God with his survival. Within two weeks, he was back in the studio -- jaw still wired -- recording his groundbreaking hit, ""Through the Wire,"" which included the lyric ""Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt."" Gaining fame and notoriety seemed to spark West's candor -- and cockiness. The following year, the rapper ran into his first bout of controversy during a Hurricane Katrina telethon where he uttered the infamous phrase, ""George Bush doesn't care about black people."" He'd go on to pose on a 2006 Rolling Stones cover as -- you guessed it -- Jesus Christ alongside the headline ""The Passion of Kanye West."" He wore a tunic and crown of thorns in the cover photo. His life changed further in 2007, when his mother, Donda, to whom he devoted so many songs and so much of his success, died of heart failure after cosmetic surgery. West's behavior grew increasingly bizarre, from engaging in beefs with photographers to storming out of awards shows when he didn't win, and culminated in an incident at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards when he famously interrupted Taylor Swift during an acceptance speech for Best Female Video. Like many talented artists, West said he was funneling his pain into his music, and despite the various styles he's adopted over the past nine years, religion has been a consistent topic in his personal and professional life.

West, who was raised in a Christian home, is no stranger to citing his relationship with God in his songs. In addition to ""Jesus Walks,"" songs such as ""The One"" and ""New God Flow"" give insight into 'Ye's self-proclaimed ""Christ-like"" persona. In his personal life, West has said he adamantly believes in providence. ""I'm on a path that God puts me on. I don't believe that all of this happened by chance,"" he told Vibe magazine in 2009. ""I just think God has put me in a really good space. And I think he has a mission for me. There's gonna be ups and downs. But it's something that he wants me to deliver to the world."" He added, ""I believe in God, but I don't buy into any particular, specific religion. So maybe I'm nondenominational or whatever. I don't know what the definition of it is. I just believe in God. I would never say that it's in Jesus' hands."" Sounds like a contradiction coming from a man who nicknamed himself Yeezus, but at what point is he dishonoring religion by claiming to be a deity?

"(CNN) -- The mother of Toronto Mayor Rob Ford said she didn't know her son's substance abuse was that bad until he announced he was getting help. ""I had no idea it was as serious as it was,"" Diane Ford told CTV News. "" But then he doesn't live with me so I don't know what he does every minute of every day."" Her son said Wednesday he is taking a break from his re-election campaign and his mayoral duties to seek help for alcohol abuse -- hours after a local newspaper reported on a new video that allegedly shows him smoking crack cocaine. ""It's not easy to be vulnerable and this is one of the most difficult times in my life,"" Ford said in a statement Wednesday. ""I have a problem with alcohol, and the choices I have made while under the influence. I have struggled with this for some time."" His statement came after the Toronto Globe and Mail reported on the new video. Family relieved . Ford's brother, Doug, said he was relieved his brother was finally getting help. ""As an older brother, I am relieved that Rob has faced his problems and has decided to seek professional help,"" said Doug Ford Jr., a Toronto city councilor. ""This is not an easy thing for anyone to do, especially when you're the mayor of the city."" In the video purportedly filmed Saturday, the newspaper reports Ford is seen smoking what a drug dealer described to the paper as crack cocaine from a copper-colored pipe. Two Globe and Mail reporters viewed the video, and the publication said it was shot in what appears to be Ford's sister's basement. Opponents jump in . The paper said the substance in the pipe could not be confirmed. The video is part ""of a package of three videos the dealer said was surreptitiously filmed around 1:15 a.m., and which he says he is now selling for 'at least six figures,'"" the paper reported. Ford's opponents in the mayoral race said he should have stepped down long ago. The election is October 27. ""It's obvious that Mr. Ford is a sick man. It's obvious that he has a serious substance abuse problem,"" said Olivia Chow, who added that she wished him strength in his recovery. ""He had his chance,"" Chow said. ""Last year, everyone said he needs to get help. He didn't. The time to take a leave of absence was last year."" Another recording . Chow and another candidate, Karen Stintz, also criticized Ford for comments attributed to him in an audio recording that was posted on a Toronto newspaper's website. CNN has not confirmed that the voice on the recording obtained by the Toronto Sun is Ford's. The mayor told a Sun columnist, ""I wouldn't say that ... I am appalled."" In the recording, reportedly made Monday, a male voice is heard saying of Stintz: ""I'd like to f****** jam her."" ""I am disappointed by the misogynistic language used by Rob Ford,"" Stintz told reporters. ""The only people who can remove Rob Ford from office are the people of Toronto. I have faith in the people of this city. Rob Ford is not Toronto. We need to move forward."" Leave is immediate . Shortly after the newspaper confronted the mayor about the alleged crack smoking video, Ford announced he was taking a break to get help. His lawyer, Dennis Morris, said the leave begins immediately. Morris later said that Ford had flown to Chicago, though he wouldn't comment on what the mayor was doing there -- including whether or not he'd go into rehab in that city or nearby. Earlier, Morris told the Globe that he questioned the authenticity of the video, and said it is hard to prove what the Mayor is smoking. Fall from grace . Ford's fall from grace started in May 2013 when a cell phone video taken months earlier appeared to show him smoking crack cocaine. Despite intense public pressure, he remained defiant and denied using any illicit drugs. In November, the city council stripped him of most of his power as mayor. That didn't stop Ford, though. He ignored calls to enter rehab or resign, instead vowing ""outright war"" on the city council. None of this stopped Ford from seeking another term in office, something he's done for the past few months despite continued public ridicule and other challenges. In January, he admitted he had suffered a ""minor setback"" after a video posted on social media showed him babbling about the city's police chief while at a fast-food restaurant. At the time, he insisted that he'd had a small amount to drink, but he hadn't taken any drugs. CNN's Paula Newton and Catherine Shoichet contributed to this report .","Lawyer says Rob Ford goes to Chicago, doesn't specify why .

"(CNN) -- Would you go to work for nothing? More to the point, would you do so risking life and limb riding a horse in one of the world's toughest races? These days amateurs competing in professional sport are almost an extinct breed, but Sam Waley-Cohen is a throwback to a bygone era -- the archetypal ""gentleman jockey."" By day he runs a multimillion-dollar series of dental practices; at the weekend he rides over some of the world's toughest fences, unpaid and purely for the love of it. A modern-day jack of all trades, he boasts helicopter and plane licenses, is a keen mountaineer and is even credited as the man that got Britain's Prince William and Kate Middleton back together after a pre-wedding separation. The highlight of his weekend job is looming on Saturday: the Grand National, the world's toughest steeplechase with a prize fund of Â£1 million ($1.66 million). ""The Grand National for a jockey is a bit like a fighter pilot in his plane in a series of dog fights,"" says the 31-year-old, who will saddle up on one of the favorites, Long Run. ""It's a very unusual challenge of very intense periods and occasional moments of reflection. It's a race that's impossible to replicate. Every single fence is a big challenge, it's twice as long as your average race. ""It's the one and only race in the world where you can say it's the best experience of your life even if you don't win."" Waley-Cohen has come close -- he was second on Oscar Time in 2011 and fourth on the same mount a year ago. Long Run, meanwhile, is a winner of the prestigious Cheltenham Gold Cup and the King George VI Chase, two other jewels in jump-jockey circles. ""One of my first memories is riding a rocking horse at home in which I acted out riding the Grand National,"" he recalls. ""It's a race I love, that gives me butterflies. If you don't get that with the National, you should probably think about doing something else."" Virtually every jockey in Saturday's field will be a paid-up professional, but Waley-Cohen -- who has about 30-40 rides a year -- is just happy to be competing with them. ""Sometimes I watch the pros in the races and wonder how I can compete with them,"" he admits. ""They're the best in the world, the best people that have ever ridden. It's such a buzz to line up alongside them. ""And I'm very lucky to have been able to do that because of my Dad."" Robert Waley-Cohen, son of the former Lord Mayor of London, owns the horses that Sam rides, and has enabled his son to pursue this hobby with, it has to be said, remarkable success. ""An amateur in horse racing, in fact in all sport, is quite rare now,"" says Waley-Cohen Jr. ""As sport is more and more professional, it's harder to compete. ""Can someone that doesn't dedicate themselves to it day-to-day do it? It's a good question. I hope I've proved it's possible and I wouldn't say it's the end of an era exactly, but it's becoming more rare. Over the last 40 years there's been less and less amateur jockeys."" National Hunt racing is a dangerous business. At last year's Cheltenham Festival, JT McNamara was paralyzed after fracturing two vertebrae in a fall, while last month fellow Irishman Jason Maguire, the 2011 Grand National winner, was put into a medically induced coma after a fall. Those are a mere snapshot of the sport's dangers, which makes the decision by an amateur, and one who became a parent for the first time last year, all the more surprising. ""I don't go to the races thinking I'm going to get hurt or that I'm not going to come back,"" Waley-Cohen says. ""If I felt like that I wouldn't do it. As for having a family, I think that makes it easier. It's not the be-all and end-all anymore as you have a family to go back to afterwards. ""But there are tough days when you fall off and are trampled over and you wonder, 'What am I doing?'"" The reason for this adrenalin junky's desire to continue racing is often attributed to his brother Thomas, who died aged 20 in 2005 from Ewing's sarcoma, a type of cancer. ""That's not quite right. It wasn't so much his death that drove me on but more the way that he lived his life,"" explains Waley-Cohen, who still rides with his brother's initials on his saddle. ""I think he'd be surprised how I've got on in the saddle, but he'd love it as the rest of my family do."" Thomas would be rather more surprised with the business empire his brother has since built up. He is chief executive of Portman Healthcare, which has 20 dental practices across the UK. He employs 300 staff and has 200,000 patients in all. He is hoping to double those numbers in the next two years. It had been rumored on the circuit that the business began after he looked around the weighing room one race day and saw the battered teeth of his peers, but he dispels this as another myth. ""Actually, there's a dentist's surgery on the way to one of the racecourses and I remember thinking, 'Why is it only individual practices, why aren't there chains?' and it went from there,"" he says. ""But it's very similar to horse racing. In racing, I surround myself with the right horses; in business I've surrounded myself with the right people."" Portman, he says, takes up 99% of his work time while his ""second job"" is usually just for weekends except for events such as Cheltenham Festival and the current Grand National week at Aintree. Should he win in the chocolate and orange colors of his father, he will be the first amateur jockey to do so since 1990, when journalist Marcus Armytage rode Mr. Frisk to victory. ""I believe I can win but that's the beauty of the National as there will be 40 jockeys on the start line thinking the same thing,"" Waley-Cohen says. ""You always need a bit of luck to get over those fences as there's so many things that can happen. But I'd say I have a great chance."" If victory is his, it will almost certainly come with a royal seal of approval. It was at his family's 17th-century mansion that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were reunited during a party that he organized, having split in 2007. Waley-Cohen attended their wedding in 2011 -- although he downplays the significance of his role in getting them back together -- and the Duchess was present when he was married later that year. ""Well, my comments on that have been taken out of context in the past so I'll leave my role on that one there,"" he says modestly. Whatever his role, Waley-Cohen is clearly a modern-day maverick, a man for all seasons.","Sam Waley-Cohen is credited with getting Prince William and Kate Middleton back together .

"(CNN) -- Tokyo has been chosen by the International Olympic Committee to host the 2020 Summer Games. In voting Saturday in Buenos Aires, the committee picked Tokyo over the two other contenders, Madrid and Istanbul. The announcement came at 5:20 a.m. Tokyo time, but a large crowd watching on an outdoor video screen burst into cheers. Tokyo previously hosted the Summer Games in 1964. Japan's bid for 2020 billed the city as the safe choice -- despite radiation leaking from the Fukushima nuclear plant. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe personally made a presentation to the committee and promised an effective cleanup. ""I am so happy, I am overjoyed,"" Abe told reporters at the post-announcement press conference. ""I would like to share this joy with the people back home. We've received so much support from the people of the IOC and I would also like to express my support to them. And to the people around the world. ""A safe and secure Olympic Games will be staged by us -- I think that was another hope for their support. I would like to pledge that we will be discharging this responsibility."" Abe said Tokyo would try to stage a successful Games to thank the world for its support after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami that devastated parts of Japan. ""Sport has the power to unite people,"" he said. ""We experienced that after the earthquake and tsunami in 2011, when athletes came to our country and helped us. Japan needs the power of sport, we need hopes and dreams."" Abe said Tokyo's 1964 Olympics had left a strong impression on him as a child. ""I was only 10 years old but a lot of kids like me were fascinated. Like many children I dreamed of winning a medal. It was a celebration giving hopes and dreams,"" he said. ""The joy (of winning the 2020 vote) was even greater than when I won my own election."" Tokyo's bid came in at $5 billion to $6 billion, compared to $19 billion pledged by Istanbul, said Ed Hula, editor and founder of aroundtherings.com, which covers the business and politics of the Olympic movement. But Tokyo's government has already amassed a $4.9 billion Olympic fund to pay to prepare for the Games, Hula said. And a $1 billion national stadium that will be used for the athletic events and the Opening Ceremonies will already have been built for the rugby World Cup in 2017 and is not considered an Olympic expense. Turkey would have been the first Muslim country to host the Games, and with a median age of less than 30 years, one of the youngest. However, it missed out for the fifth time. Istanbul would have been ""a more emotional choice,"" Hula said. But its huge bid would have been needed to fund infrastructure improvements, including modernization of its transportation system. Turkey's border with Syria also might have troubled some committee members, he said. And this summer, the image of Turkish sport took a hit when about three dozen athletes tested positive for drugs, he said. June's rioting in Istanbul's Taksim Square may also have tainted the city's hopes, though Turkish Prime Minister Recep Erdogan tried to persuade IOC members ahead of Saturday's vote. ""We live at a time when our region and the world crave for peace,"" Erdogan said as part of Istanbul's final presentation. ""And at this critical moment, we would like to send a strong message of peace to the whole world from Istanbul, the city of friendship and brotherhood."" Tokyo led after a first round of voting Saturday but fell short of a majority, with 42. Istanbul and Madrid tied for second on 26 votes each, and a 49-45 tiebreaker vote put the Turkish city in the final runoff with Tokyo. Tokyo won the deciding vote, 60 to Istanbul's 36, according to an IOC tweet. Madrid, like Tokyo, was a repeat bidder -- making its third consecutive case for the Games, one that was little changed from previous attempts, Hula said. The Spaniards' $2 billion bid said they had little need for new infrastructure, he said. And they have ample sports experience, having hosted a number of other high-profile, international events. But the country's economic plight remained a drawback, with one out of four adults unemployed. Though Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy insisted that rate is improving, ""the fact is that most reasonable, sensible economists think unemployment is going to linger at a high level for years to come,"" Hula said. And Spain's athletes, too, have had issues with doping accusations. In a case that occurred several years ago, blood bags from athletes who had tested positive were destroyed, Hula said. ""It's been a long-running situation."" Spain's Prince Philip, a former Olympic sailor, was a lead figure in Spain's presentation. ""Some people around the world have questioned hosting the Games in a time of economic uncertainty,"" he told the IOC members Saturday ahead of the voting. ""But I don't see this as a threat to the Olympics, I see it as an opportunity. The benefits of sport are measured in generations, not in dollars."" On Sunday, the three sports competing to be added to the 2020 roster will know their fate. Squash is hoping to be included for the first time, but is up against a combined baseball/softball bid and wrestling -- which is seeking to be reinstated. The 125th IOC Session will be the last for its president Jacques Rogge, who is standing down after 12 years in the role. The 71-year-old's successor will be elected Tuesday. The 2016 Summer Olympics will be in Brazil. The Winter Olympics will be held in Russia in 2014 and South Korea in 2018.

"(CNN) -- Just another big name for Zach Galifianakis and his comic Web series, ""Between Two Ferns."" In March, the actor and comedian had on President Barack Obama. Thursday, the guest was Brad Pitt. In classic ""Between Two Ferns"" style -- that is, the style of an early-'80s public access show -- Galifianakis made Pitt awkward from the beginning. The ""Fury"" actor was introduced as ""Bradley Pitts"" (and ID'ed as ""Bart Pit"" from ""12 Years a Salve"") and immediately asked how old he was when he lost his virginity and why he doesn't shower. Pitt accepted most of the insults with a blank good nature, even when Galifianakis called his new movie ""Furry."" At one point, Galifianakis brought him a tightly wrapped gift that looked suspiciously like a bong. ""It's a bassoon,"" said Galifianakis. ""You know I'm a dad now,"" Pitt responded. ""We don't 'bassoon' in my house anymore."" Published Wednesday to comedy site Funny or Die, the clip had 3 million views by late Thursday afternoon. Things turned ugly when Galifianakis asked Pitt about the focus on his looks and how it distracts people from realizing ""that you're just a sh***y actor."" Pitt's reaction was full of, um, spit and vinegar. The actor did get a chance to put in a plug for Make It Right, his charity. But he was quickly interrupted by Galifianakis, who ushered comedian Louis C.K. onstage for a cameo standup routine.","Brad Pitt is latest guest on comic Web series ""Between Two Ferns""

"(CNN) -- Airport stopovers are seldom the highlight of any business traveler's journey. Hours whittled away in generic fast food outlets or tacky themed bars, which in many cases represent the extent of terminal building entertainment, ensure onward journeys can't come quickly enough. For those passing through Changi Airport in Singapore, however, a brief window between connecting flights is a great opportunity to explore one of Asia's most happening destinations. The city-state's condensed landscape -- the entire country is squeezed into a land area smaller than most big cities -- means visitors can quickly tour some of Singapore's most famous attractions and be back at the airport in a matter of hours. Changi itself offers free city tours to passengers with a stopover of five hours or more but visitors can also leave the airport to traverse the city on their own accord. With the help of Shawn Low, travel editor of Lonely Planet's Asia Pacific edition, we highlight some of the must-see Singaporean sights for those with a few spare hours between flights, whatever the time of the day. See also: Asia's budget airlines spread their wings . Early morning . A stroll in Singapore's lush Botanic Gardens at sunrise provides a great opportunity to catch the normally bustling metropolis in one of its more tranquil moments, says Low. Dense green foliage is complemented by a selection of finely manicured greens and picturesque lakes, a genuine oasis amidst the concrete jungle of high rises and skyscrapers. From here, a short trip down the nearby Orchard Road, one of Singapore's main retail thoroughfares, allows for a spot of shopping. It also has good transport links back to the airport. ""Gadgets are particularly cheap"" in Singapore, says Low, and there are plenty of bargains to catch the eye, especially at Funan IT Mall on North Bridge Road. All those splashing out while in the city should be mindful not to forget they are eligible for a Goods and Services Tax refund (worth 7% of their total purchase value) when they pass through customs at the airport, he adds. Afternoon in the shade . The Singapore sun is at its strongest between lunch time and late afternoon, with temperatures regularly reaching as high as 31Ëš Celsius (88 Fahrenheit). Indoor activities at this time of day can therefore offer a more comfortable pursuit for those dashing around on a tight time scale, says Low. Fortunately, the city's art galleries and cultural centers provide plenty to see and do whilst offering an air-conditioned sanctuary away from the midday sun. The National Museum, Singapore Art Museum, and Peranakan Museum are within walking distance of the city's famous Colonial District, which is easily accessible from the airport by either bus, tour bus or taxi. For those less charmed by artistic endeavors, the area's many stylish restaurants, coffee houses and bars offer an equally quaint cultural experience. Spectacular sunset . A good way to get a sense of Singapore's vibrant skyline is to find a perch on one of the city's many rooftop bars come sundown, says Low. Ku De Tah at the Marina Bay Sands complex and the Lantern Bar at the Fullerton Bay Hotel offer particularly appealing vistas, as well as highly agreeable Singapore Slings, he adds. Those looking for a panorama of the city without the alcoholic beverage can take a ride on the Singapore Flyer, a 165 meter-high observation wheel -- similar in concept to the London Eye -- that enables spectacular 360 degree views. Suitably impressed by the city's vast neon silhouette, visitors can then head down to the neighboring Geylang district for a genuine Singaporean eating experience, says Low. See also: Business Traveller in Singapore . Restaurants such as the Sin Huat Eating House offer local specialties such as crab bee hoon (mud crab cooked with rice noodles) while cramped food stalls and bustling coffee houses crackle with the chatter of locals late into the night. Night Safari . Like all major modern cities, Singapore offers just as much to see and do come night time as it does during the daylight hours. Low highlights the Night Safari at Singapore's world renowned zoo as a particularly fun attraction for families and wildlife lovers alike. Visitors can get up close and personal with a variety of nocturnal animals -- Singapore zoo is famed for its policy of keeping animals in open enclosures rather than in cages -- before hopping in a taxi back to the airport. Low also singles out Little India, home to Singapore's vibrant ex-pat Indian community and a remnant of the city's previous incarnation as a British colonial trading port, as a particularly authentic night time activity. ""(Little India) is as close as you'll get to the Singapore of the old days,"" says Low. He says Friday nights and weekends, when the streets throng with market stalls and ""the redolent scent of spices and colorful flowers"" are the best time to visit.","Singapore's condensed nature means it is possible to explore the city in just a few hours .

"(CNN) -- DNA from a 45,000-year-old leg bone is giving scientists a better idea of when modern humans first started mating with Neanderthals. The thigh bone was found six years ago on the banks of the Irtysh River in Siberia by Nikolai Peristov, a Russian artist who carves jewelry from ancient mammoth tusks, according to the journal Nature. ""It was quite fossilized, and the hope was that it might turn out (to be) old. We hit the jackpot,"" Bence Viola, a paleoanthropologist who co-led a study of the remains, told Nature. ""It was older than any other modern human yet dated."" 2013: Oldest human DNA found in Spain . For those who aren't familiar with our Stone Age ancestors, Neanderthals are an extinct species of human who differ in DNA from what scientists call ""modern humans"" by less than 1%. Modern humans first left Africa about 60,000 years ago, according to National Geographic, and wandered toward Asia and Europe. There, they encountered Neanderthals and another species of human called Denisovans. Scientists believe Neanderthals died out about 30,000 years ago, possibly because they were simply absorbed into the modern human population. Roughly 2% of genomes of non-Africans today come from the Neanderthal species, according to Nature. Until now, scientists hadn't pinpointed exactly when Neanderthals and modern humans began interbreeding. Sequencing of the 45,000-year-old bone's DNA showed that 2.3% of his genome also came from Neanderthals, according to a study published Wednesday. His Neanderthal DNA segments were long, the scientists say, which suggests that the love fest between the two species began between 50,000 and 60,000 years ago. ""Paternal and maternal chromosomes are shuffled together in each generation, so that over time the DNA segments from any individual become shorter,"" Nature explains. 7,000-year-old male, dark skin, blue eyes, likes hunting ... Of course, when it comes to evolution, there's always a debate. Some scientists believe modern humans left Africa more than 100,000 years ago. ""This is just a random find in a Siberian river deposit,"" Chris Stringer, a paleoanthropologist at London's Natural History Museum, told Nature. ""What else could be there when they start looking systematically?""","Scientists sequence DNA of 45,000-year-old leg bone found in Siberia .

"Khartoum, Sudan (CNN) -- A group of international cyclists gathered around in the restaurant of Khartoum's old Accropole Hotel and listened attentively to an orientation by the tour's chief coordinator. He listed what they would need to pack for the daily ride, which included water, snacks, energy bars, patch kits, pumps, cash, cell phones and cameras. ""And you'll need butt cream,"" Randy Pielsticker, 36, added jokingly, referring to small containers of protective balm designed for cyclists. Considering the average 12 hours daily ride and the 12,000-kilometer length of the tour, he was right. Last week a group of cyclists took to the road on the Tour d'Afrique expedition starting from Khartoum, Sudan, where the White Nile and the Blue Nile meet. The four-month road trip will take them through nine countries until they reach Cape Town, South Africa, on the continent's southern-most tip. The idea for the expedition came to a former development worker, Henry Gold, who had worked in places like Ethiopia and Sudan. Gold wanted to find a way to provide cheap, sustainable transportation solutions to local populations on the continent, and attract attention by organizing a continental bike race. ""I wanted to start producing bikes for Africa that would help kickstart development -- sort of like China and India with their bikes,"" he said. The bike production project did not take off, but the idea of a Cairo to Cape Town bike race did, and in 2003, the first Tour d'Afrique race took place, setting a Guinness World Record for the fastest human-powered crossing of Africa. It is run by a Toronto-based company of the same name, which now sponsors seven global treks, with Tour d'Afrique representing its flagship race. ""This one tends to be the biggest draw,"" said Pielsticker. ""There is a mystery and magic to it."" For the past 11 years, the Tour d'Afrique expedition began from Cairo. This year, however, matters were different, because of current events. ""There's an international travel advisory against traveling to Egypt right now,"" explained Pielsticker. Ironically, perhaps, the tour started this year from Khartoum. It may be better known for its involvement in conflict in regions like Darfur, but Pielsticker described the north of Sudan as ""one of the safest places in the world."" ""People here are really nice and hospitable,"" he added. The change in plans made organizers add new routes and destinations to this year's tour to maintain the tour's length, including routes passing by the pyramids of Meroe in Sudan and the rock churches of Lalibela, in Ethiopia, a favorite for many. ""Ethiopia is a classic,"" said Sharita Van der Merwe, 29, a seasoned tour guide. ""The history and the culture are amazing."" In addition to ancient sites in Sudan and Ethiopia, the tour's highlights include crossing the equator in Kenya, passing Mount Kilimanjaro and the Serengeti in Tanzania, Lake Malawi, Victoria Falls, the dunes of the Namib desert and on to Table Mountain in Cape Town. But the trek, of course, is no easy ride. There are tremendous obstacles to overcome, including navigational challenges, mechanical problems with the bikes, harsh weather conditions, difficult terrain, possible water shortages, the risk of diseases like malaria, and even predatory animals. And then there's the challenge of having strangers get along for four months. ""It's a social experiment,"" said Van der Merwe, giggling. But the greatest challenge, Pielsticker maintains, is a universal one. ""The biggest hazard for cyclists is the same everywhere in the world: the automobile,"" insists Pielsticker. Cyclists of all walks of life, ages and nationalities have joined the tour in the past. This year, they come from 13 different countries, with the youngest being 20 and the oldest 73. Alessandro Mauri, 22, just graduated from college, and wanted ""time off and to take an adventure."" On his first tour, Mauri, whose father is Italian and mother is South African, sees the tour as an opportunity to reconnect with the continent. ""I've always loved Africa,"" he said. Mauri is looking forward to some of the tour's challenges, including the sandstorms of northern Sudan. ""I would like to experience a haboob,"" he said with a smile. The tour often brings back alumni and most notable of them is Sandra McMillan. McMillan, 73, a retired real estate agent and a mother of five from Canada, joined the first Cairo to Cape tour in 2003. It was personal tragedy that brought her to Africa. ""My 18 year old daughter was killed in an accident in 2001,"" she said. ""She had a burning desire to go to Africa."" In 2002, McMillan saw an advertisement for Tour d'Afrique. ""I said to myself, I want to do this. ""And there was a category for the leisurely fit,"" she added with a laugh. McMillan acknowledged that many thought she would not make it to the end. ""There was even a bet that I would be the first to go,"" she said. But she completed the tour, and is now back on her fourth tour, 11 years later. While the tour may provide an opportunity for some to take an adventure in Africa, the group's founders are keen on giving back to local communities by donating bikes to individuals or organizations in the continent, supporting projects that promote bicycle awareness and raising funds for cyclists' favorite charities. The Tour d'Afrique Foundation, the company's development arm, has teamed up with many African groups, such as the South Africa-based Happy Africa Foundation, to distribute donated bicycles to students and health workers in several countries. In Zambia, for example, Christabel Mushe, a 19-year-old female student used to walk four miles a day to school and arrive tired, which impacted her concentration in class, and even sometimes missed school. ""But when I received the bike, all of this was over,"" she said. ""Both of my performance and attendance improved."" Roy Kagna, 60, is a health caregiver in Zambia. ""I have been able to visit 10 to 15 patients on a daily basis, more than I used to when I had no bike,"" he said. But perhaps most importantly, the tour has provided its participants with a deeper insight into Africa. ""I learned that there is such commonality among humanity regardless of color,"" said McMillan. ""The tour is not life changing, it is life affirming,"" she added. ""It teaches you what your strengths and weakness are.""","The Tour d'Afrique is a four-month, 12,000 km cycle race across the length of Africa .

"Washington (CNN) -- As New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen accused former Sen. Scott Brown of ""fear-mongering"" on Ebola, Democrats strongly agreed, Republicans completely disagreed, and independent voters stayed neutral. That's according to the results of Microsoft Bing Pulse voting, where viewers reacted in real time to the CNN/NH1 New Hampshire Senate debate. The two candidates squared off on national issues such as Ebola, terror threats, immigration, Obamacare and the minimum wage. Democrats and Republicans intensely favored the view of their party's candidate, naturally disagreeing when the opponent retorted. Ebola, 'fear-mongering' dominate New Hampshire debate . Independents, however, remained true to their individuality, by overall not aligning with a particular party or candidate. Brown blasted President Barack Obama's handling of the Ebola outbreak, saying if Romney were leading the nation, he would have minimized the threat and would have had a ""clear and concise plan."" Those words caused Republicans to strongly agree, while independents agreed less intensely in Brown's favor. When the debate turned to ISIS, independents aligned more with Democrats. Both groups agreed with Shaheen when she supported Obama's decision not to send U.S. ground troops to the Middle East. New Hampshire is known for its independent voters, who in September accounted for 43% of the state's electorate. The number of independent voters participating in Pulse was even higher, representing about two-thirds of participants. 'Rational fear' and 5 other key moments from debate . When the results are broken down by gender, men and women did not line up on the same wavelength. Men and women both agreed when Brown criticized Shaheen for voting with Obama, but the genders diverged when Shaheen defended her support of the minimum wage, with women showing higher support. The highest volume of voting occurred after debate moderator Wolf Blitzer asked Brown whether he supports raising the minimum wage, and Brown referenced a time when he worked a minimum-wage job. ""My first job was at Dunkin' Donuts cleaning the grease trap,"" recalled Brown. ""I still remember what the smell is."" New Hampshire was represented well in the Pulse audience, with 63% of participants saying they are registered voters of the Granite State.","Viewers voted during the New Hampshire debate using Bing Pulse .

"(CNN) -- Under a blazing sun in early June, a group of pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine were digging amid pine woods near the town of Krazny Liman. Their grizzled commander was a bearded man in his 50s who would not tell us where he was from, but acknowledged that he wasn't local. He was proud to show off his unit's most prized possession -- a truck-mounted anti-aircraft unit that was Russian-made. He told us the weapon had been seized from a Ukrainian base. A few miles away, in the town of Kramatorsk, rebel fighters displayed two combat engineering tanks they said they had seized them from a local factory. Eastern Ukraine has long been a center of weapons production. They had parked one of the tanks next to the town square. These were just two instances of how the rebels in eastern Ukraine were steadily adding more sophisticated weapons to their armory, including tanks, multiple rocket launchers -- and anti-aircraft systems. In early June, they began to target Ukrainian planes and helicopters, with some success. The day after we met the commander in the pine woods, an Antonov AN-26 transport plane was brought down over nearby Slovyansk. Several Mi-8 and Mi-24 helicopters were also hit in this period, as was an Ilyushin IL-76 cargo plane near Luhansk -- it is about the size of a passenger jet. Forty-nine military personnel were killed when the IL-76 crashed short of the airport. For the most part, these aircraft were flying at relatively low altitudes, and were targeted by shoulder-launched SA-7 missiles and anti-aircraft guns. The pro-Russian rebels had taken control of several Ukrainian military depots and bases and stripped them of their weapons. The SA-7 was standard Soviet issue. Relatively easy to operate, it is effective to altitudes of some 2,500 meters (8,000 feet). But it and ZU 23-2 anti-aircraft batteries, which rebel units also obtained, are a world away from the SA-11 or ""Buk"" system that seems increasingly likely to have been used to shoot down Flight MH17 on Thursday. Stealing a Buk . Could the pro-Russian rebels have acquired a serviceable Buk from a Ukrainian base and operated it? The evidence is circumstantial; a great deal of Ukrainian military hardware is in poor condition or redundant. But on June 29, rebels raided the Ukrainian army's A-1402 missile facility near Donetsk. Photographs show them examining what they found. The Russian website Vosti ran an article the same day titled ""Skies of Donetsk will be defended by surface-to-air missile system Buk."" The article claimed: ""The anti-air defense point is one of the divisions of the missile corps and is equipped with motorized ""Buk"" anti-aircraft missile systems."" Peter Felstead, an expert on former Soviet military hardware at Janes IHS, says that ""the Buk is in both the Russian and Ukrainian inventories, but it's unclear whether the one suspected in the shoot-down was taken by rebels when they overran a Ukrainian base, or was supplied by Russia."" He told CNN that the Buk ""would normally operate with a separate radar that picks up the overall air picture. This was almost certainly not the case with MH17,"" making it more difficult to identify the target and track its course. Among the pro-Russian rebels are fighters who served in the Russian army. It is possible that some were familiar with the Buk, but Felstead agrees with the U.S. and Ukrainian assessment that Russian expertise would have been needed to operate it. ""The system needs a crew of about four who know what they're doing. To operate the Buk correctly, Russian assistance would have been required unless the rebel operators were defected air defense operators - which is unlikely."" It is now the ""working theory"" in the U.S. intelligence community that the Russian military supplied a Buk surface-to-air missile system to the rebels, a senior US defense official told CNN Friday. Russia has denied that any equipment in service with the Russian armed forces has crossed the border into Ukraine. And Aleksander Borodai, the self-described prime minister of the Donetsk People's Republic, said Saturday his forces did not have weapons capable of striking an aircraft at such a high altitude. But someone in the border region where eastern Ukraine meets Russia has been using an advanced anti-air missile system. Late Wednesday, the day before MH17 was presumably hit, a Ukrainian air force Sukhoi Su-25 combat jet was shot down close to the border with Russia. The Ukrainian Defense Ministry told CNN that the plane was flying at 6,200-6,500 meters (about 21,000 feet) and was hit near a town called Amvrosiivka, which is only some 30 kilometers (20 miles) from where MH17 was hit and 15 kilometers (10 miles) from the border with Russia. The Ukrainian military alleged the missile had been fired from Russian territory. It was the first time that a combat jet flying at high speed had been hit and came two days after an AN-26 -- flying at a similar altitude in the same area -- was shot down further north, in the Luhansk area. Smuggling on the black roads . The Russian Defense Ministry said Friday that weapons could not be smuggled across the border ""secretly."" But they can. By early June, rebels controlled several crossings along a stretch of border more than 200 kilometers (125 miles) long. The border area is open farmland that was neither patrolled regularly nor even marked in many places. Dozens of unmonitored tracks known as black roads -- because they have been used for smuggling -- cross the border. Additionally, the Ukrainian border guard service was in disarray after an attack on its command center in Luhansk early in June. On the road east toward the border through the town of Antratsyt there was no sign of a Ukrainian military or police presence. The pro-Russian rebels had already begun to bring across heavy weapons at that point. A CNN team visited the border post at Marynivka in June, soon after a five-hour firefight involving border guards and members of the self-declared Vostok battalion of rebels who had been trying to bring over two Russian armored personnel carriers. They had been abandoned during the battle. The unknowns are these: Just how much weaponry has been brought in from Russia, how was it obtained, and did it include the SA-11 Buk? In June, the U.S. State Department claimed that three T-64 tanks, several rocket launchers and other military vehicles had crossed the Russian border. Ukraine made similar accusations, saying the weapons had gone to Snezhnoe, a rebel stronghold close to where MH17 came down. The State Department said the tanks had been in storage in south-west Russia, suggesting collusion between the Russian authorities -- at some level -- and the rebels. It said at the time that the equipment held at the storage site also included ""multiple rocket launchers, artillery, and air defense systems."" It added, notably, that ""more advanced air defense systems have also arrived at this site."" Moscow rejected the claims as fake. NATO has also released satellite images which, it said, showed tanks in the Rostov-on-Don region in Russia early in June, before they were taken to eastern Ukraine. The tanks had no markings. Even so, some experts, such as Mark Galeotti at New York University's Center for Global Affairs, say the evidence is largely circumstantial. NATO's images did not show the tanks actually crossing into Ukraine. Wherever they came from, Russian language websites soon featured calls for people with military skills to call a number associated with the separatist Donetsk People's Republic if they could help operate or maintain the tanks. One answered, ""I served in the military engineering academy...and am a former commander in the intelligence."" But the separatists' greatest vulnerability was always from the air. The Ukrainians had already shown, in driving them away from the Donetsk airport at the end of May, that they could use airpower to devastating effect. And they had begun to fly at higher altitudes to avoid shoulder-launched missiles. To hold what remained of their territory, the pro-Russian rebels needed to be able to challenge Ukrainian dominance of the skies. Whether they received help from across the border to do so, and in what way, is the question that governments around the world want answered.","Rebels have downed Ukrainian planes flying at high altitudes .

"Copenhagen, Denmark (CNN) -- Be prepared, the next big thing facing a green makeover might just be your closet. The glitzy world of fashion and design doesn't typically conjure up images of sustainability and social consciousness, but if its up to Eva Kruse, CEO of the Danish Fashion Institute and Chairman of the Nordic Fashion Association, that's all going to change. In the last month, she has pulled off the largest sustainable fashion summit in the world, and starting this week, she is launching a global social media campaign, aiming to forever change the way we look at our clothes. Her goal is for all companies in the industry to declare sustainability a key value. ""I have worked in the fashion industry for nearly 20 years, and it is a wonderful and exciting industry, but it is also one of the largest and most polluting in the world,"" said Kruse. From the massive consumption of water and fertilizer in cotton production, to the chemical processing at plants, the pollution of local waterways and environments, safety issues for workers, fair wages, child labor and other social concerns -- issues for the fashion industry are enormous, she says. ""That is why it is so important that we address this ... and because of the size of the industry, even a small change can make a big difference,"" says Kruse. Kruse, who founded the Danish Fashion Institute as the only employee in 2005, is credited by industry professionals and government ministers for having put Danish design and sustainable fashion on the world map. Last month, she gathered more than 1,000 people -- including Hollywood celebrities, international designers and other industry professionals -- at the Copenhagen Fashion Summit, to explore sustainable solutions. The culmination was a suggested Code of Conduct for the Fashion and Textile industry, created in conjunction with the United Nations, and to be presented alongside the Rio+20 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in Brazil in June. ""It aims to drill into the supply chain,"" says Soren Mandrup Petersen, Head of Partnerships and Local Networks at U.N. Global Compact, ""and if the sector responds, it will have a tremendous impact."" ""There is a movement underway,"" says Kruse. ""It is happening, and we can help shed light on it."" That is also the goal of her latest venture launching this week -- an online campaign called NICE, or the Nordic Initiative, Clean and Ethical. It aims to have the industry join forces around change, and to educate consumers to make conscious choices. ""The entire field is so heavily knowledge based that it makes it difficult for companies to get started. The key is to make ... knowledge accessible and to create networks, because there are solutions."" She says new and sustainable fashions are already being made from innovative textiles such as milk fibers, corn, and bamboo. Among those leading the charge are companies like Swedish chain store H&M with their Conscious Collection, Patagonia, Danish design house Trash-Couture, and the PPR Group with brands like Gucci, Stella McCartney, Alexander McQueen and Puma. H&M's head of sustainability, Helena Helmersson says this is the future. ""Customers are becoming more and more aware and want transparency, which makes companies improve their sustainability performance and make more sustainable products."" And, she says, ""as a big player we can help drive demand."" At Trash-Couture, which boasts a massive list of celebrity clients like Penelope Cruz, Rachel Weisz, Kirsten Dunst, Celine Dion and many others -- ethical fashion and the way they reuse, redesign, respin, and recycle leftover fabric from their own collection and that of other design houses is part of the design. ""As pioneers we feel we have helped set the agenda on an issue that is about much more than just fashion,"" says managing director, Nanna Lowe. ""This way, fashion suddenly gets new meaning, becoming a statement, a value, an act."" Kruse agrees, saying it has the potential to push other industries with it, by making it look smart to consider your choices. ""If all the big brands and strong designers care -- and show and tell that they care -- then people could also begin to think differently about how they spend their money. Her goal: ""To have people join forces to help us change the world."" And to her, that change starts in our closets. But don't worry, she says, ""the aim isn't for all of us to start wearing brown. Sustainable fashion can be equally sexy, desirable and fantastic in every way. The aim is to create the brilliance with less impact on people and our planet.""","Danish fashion chief launches NICE, a social media campaign to make fashion more sustainable .

"(CNN) -- Robin Williams' daughter chose a hummingbird to honor her late father.

"(CNN) -- When Matthew Kabonero and Daniel Ndahiro first met at a high school just outside of Kampala, they immediately became firm friends. Years later, their friendship would serve as the foundation for starting one of Uganda's first digital advertising companies -- Camouflage Media. The firm provides digital screens for corporate clients which can be seen in Kampala's supermarkets, shops and corporate lobbies. It also offers social media services by managing companies' online presence and growing their fan base. ""Advertising in general was an area of interest"" says Matthew Kabonero. ""The idea to make it digital was because of the missed opportunity we saw in areas where static adverts were not effective enough to gather interest, for example at waiting areas of an office reception. ""You can only look at a poster for so long,"" he says. Kabonero and Ndahiro both studied business administration, but were quick to jump on the opportunity they saw in making advertising go digital in Uganda. They gathered funds from family and launched their venture. ""With print, you have to print newspapers every day, but with digital advertising it's just a matter of changing the content that you have and distributing it online, so the expense of having to go through the printing is minimized,"" says Kabonero. The company now employs seven people and is breaking even, but they hope to start making a profit in the next six months. They have already gained patronage from one of the country's most profitable banks, Standard Chartered, as well as MTN, a large telecom company. The young entrepreneurs admit it wasn't all plain sailing though -- early challenges included difficulties in coordinating teams which were deployed across Uganda, and meeting deadlines. But Kabonero and Ndahiro insist that solving problems helped them learn, and grow a stronger business. ""What sets us apart from our competitors in the market is that we also create content for them. So we've gone a step further"" says Ndahiro. When it comes opportunities for entrepreneurs in Uganda, both think are great: ""Many markets out there are saturated,"" says Kabonero, ""however when you come to Uganda you'll find that many businesses that exist in other areas don't exist in Uganda, so that's an opportunity that exists."" The team want to expand their business to the country's classrooms by providing interactive digital solutions for teachers, and they also want to take their screens outdoors: ""We envision starting a digital revolution in Uganda and, who knows, perhaps in other parts of Africa as well. It would be a dream come true."" concludes Kabonero. Read more: Africa's techies hop aboard the StartupBus .

"London (CNN) -- The Duchess of Cambridge has successfully graduated as a ""fully fledged member"" of Britain's monarchy after fulfilling all her objectives one year on from her marriage to Prince William, a senior royal source has told CNN. St. James's Palace, which represents her, William and his brother Harry, now regards Kate's ""induction"" as complete and the duchess herself feels ""fulfilled"" by the achievements of the past 12 months, the source said. Confirmation of her smooth transition into the ranks of royalty will help dispel fears voiced ahead of last year's wedding that commoner-born Kate would struggle with the pressure of being thrust into the public eye. But, thanks to guidance from her husband, Kate feels she has settled into her new life, CNN has learned. ""She would never judge her achievements but she has succeeded in doing what she set out to do in her first year,"" the source said. ""She has achieved her objectives."" Kate's other mentor has been her father-in-law, Prince Charles, with whom she has become close. ""They spend a lot of time together. They go on visits to the opera and art galleries. They share passions that neither of the princes share. They get on very well."" Gallery: Photographer's year with duchess . The source was speaking to CNN for a new documentary: The Royals; Kate, Duchess of Cambridge airing on May 4. In it, CNN explores how the whole royal family has thrown its support behind their newest member as she finds her feet. ""The queen has made a lot of time for the duchess. [Kate] gets on very well with the queen. They have a warm relationship as was evidenced in Leicester,"" says the source, referring to a visit last March when the pair were seen chatting and smiling. It has been a whirlwind year for Kate. Her wedding last April, one the biggest media events in history, was followed by a triumphant tour of Canada, which she regards as the highlight of her official year, and a trip to the United States. Watch: The Royals: Kate, Duchess of Cambridge . When the duchess returned to Britain, she began shaping her own identity within the royal family. In January, she announced her support for four charities and began her first solo engagements. Last month she made her inaugural speech with the help of William who, CNN has learned, coached her via phone from the Falklands where he was on military service. By delivering her first speech, Kate completed the full range of official duties expected of a working royal. A small palace team has provided what training it can for the duchess, but they accept that the best insight comes from William and Charles. However, Kate has also proved to be a natural. ""For her, the public engagements are a joy,"" the royal source said. ""She enjoys it. Not much fazes her. She is confident enough to handle it. She is strong-willed. She knows her mind. She is professional."" Kate's hands-on approach came to light when the media was bombarding the palace with calls demanding to know the name of her new puppy. The duchess was unwilling to let her puppy become a public relations event, CNN understands. Instead she revealed it naturally during a visit to a school when a student asked her. In case you missed it, the newest member of the royal family is called Lupo.","Palace source tells CNN that Kate feels ""fulfilled"" by her achievements over the past 12 months .

"(CNN) -- The three women and a child who were freed Monday after years of imprisonment inside a Cleveland house may have remained trapped had it not been for the efforts of a man who was visiting two women on the porch of a house across the street. ""One of the women I was with told me that something was happening in front of the house,"" Angel Cordero, 32, said on CNN's ""Piers Morgan Live"" on Wednesday. Cordero told CNN en EspaÃ±ol that, seeing a woman screaming for help from inside the house across the street, he went to the door of the house and asked her if the house was burning. ""She told me no, that she had been held, kidnapped, for 10 years,"" the Dominican man who has lived in the United States since 2011 said in Spanish. Cordero said that the woman had cracked opened the inner of two front doors but that the outer door was closed with a chain. ""I tried to open the door, but I couldn't, so I gave it a few kicks,"" he said. ""She succeeded in escaping through the bottom of the door, and once she had escaped, she remembered the girl and returned into the house, picked up the girl and left. And when she left with the little girl, she said, 'Let's get out of here because, if this guy comes, he's going to kill us. If he finds me here, he's going to kill me and he's going to kill you.'"" The woman, later identified as Amanda Berry, apparently was making reference to the owner of the house, whom police have identified as Ariel Castro, and who has been charged in the case. Castro held on $8 million bond . Berry then crossed the street with her child, 6-year-old Jocelyn, and went to the house of Altagracia Tejeda, the neighbor Cordero had been visiting, where she called 911. But Cordero's job was not done. Once police arrived and began talking with Berry, the girl, dressed only in diapers and a T-shirt, began screaming, he said. ""I tried to control the girl,"" he said. ""I tried to calm her until her mother finished with the police."" Police then entered the house at 2207 Seymour Avenue and escorted out the other two women: Michelle Knight and Gina DeJesus. ""They took Michelle and Gina out covered up,"" he said. ""I didn't see their faces."" Cordero said that he has visited his friend in the neighborhood nearly every day, but had never before seen anyone other than Castro at the house across the street. ""He entered through the back,"" he said. ""No one ever saw anyone (else) enter or leave there. ... There was never anything that would attract attention."" Asked if he considers himself a hero, he allowed that, ""I feel a little proud."" But, he added, ""the important thing is that she is alive."" Cordero's account was corroborated by Tejeda, who is also from the Dominican Republic. Cordero said he is unemployed, having recently been laid off from his job as a tree trimmer for a power company. Another neighbor, Charles Ramsey, has received the lion's share of media attention for his role in freeing the group. But Ramsey showed up after Berry had already escaped, according to Cordero. Suspect's daughter: No monster in our blood . There is no dispute that Ramsey also contacted police. ""Hey bro,"" Ramsey told a 911 operator. ""Check this out. I just came from McDonald's right? So I'm on my porch eating my little food, right? This broad is trying to break out the f-----g house next door to me, so there's a bunch of people on the street right now and s--t. So we're like, 'What's wrong, what's the problem?' She's like, 'This m--------r done kidnapped me and my daughter. ... She said her name is Linda Berry or some s--t. I don't know who the f--k that is, I just moved over here, bro. You know what I mean?"" He then answers the 911 operator's questions about Berry, what she looked like and what she was wearing. ""Are the people that she said did this, are they still in the house?"" the 911 operator asks. ""I don't have a f-----g clue, bro. Like I said, I just came from McDonald's."" The operator then asks him to check to see whether Berry needs an ambulance. ""She needs everything. She's in a panic, bro. She's been kidnapped, so, you know, put yourself in her shoes."" ""We'll send the police out,"" the operator responds.","Cordero responds to a cry for help from a neighbor .

"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- Police arrested four suspected members of the Basque separatist group ETA early Tuesday, seizing 200 kilograms (440 pounds) of explosives, Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said. The pre-dawn raids took place in Bilbao, the largest Basque city in northern Spain, and the nearby town of Galdakao, where police also found bomb-making components, Rubalcaba said in a nationally televised news conference. Spanish media, citing police sources, said the suspects are linked to ETA's killing two years ago of a police intelligence officer in the Basque region, but Rubalcaba only would confirm that investigators were analyzing possible links to a series of unsolved ETA attacks. The arrests come during a unilateral ETA cease-fire which the outlawed group declared January 10, promising it would be ""permanent, general and verifiable."" But the Socialist government has repeatedly said it would not ease the police pressure against ETA, which in 2006 broke an earlier ""permanent"" cease-fire with a car bomb at Madrid's airport that killed two men and caused extensive damage. Rubalcaba said the arrests Tuesday have ""enormous importance"" because the four are suspected of operating clandestinely for ETA, under the cover of living and working ""as normal citizens, integrated into Basque society, which makes it very difficult for police to find them."" Police have worked to locate these suspected clandestine operatives for more than two years, since the arrest of a suspected ETA military chief in November 2008, Rubalcaba said. The suspects include two men and two women, ranging in age from 31 to 37 years old, the Interior Ministry said in a statement, adding that police also seized three firearms and forged identity documents for the Basque regional police force in the raids. ETA is blamed for more than 800 deaths in its decades-long fight for Basque independence and is listed as a terrorist group by the United States and the European Union. ETA's last killing in the Basque region was in 2009.  A senior police intelligence officer, Eduardo Puelles, died when a limpet bomb -- which attaches to its target magnetically -- exploded under his car.  It is among a number unsolved ETA attacks over the past few years. On January 18, a week after ETA's latest cease-fire announcement, police arrested 10 people, most of them for alleged links to a shadowy group called Ekin, which authorities say passes directives from ETA's leadership to a string of equally shadowy support groups. ""The government's anti-terrorist policy has not changed at all because ETA has not definitively abandoned its weapons. And as long as it doesn't, the police will continue to arrest them, one after another,"" Rubalcaba said.","The Basque separatist group declared a unilateral cease-fire in January .

"(CNN) -- As word spread this week that some benefits of the nation's health care law will not extend to the thousands of undocumented immigrants given reprieve from deportation by the Obama administration, advocacy groups were reminded that the youths' status remains much in limbo. The Obama administration earned the praise of immigrant advocacy groups when it decided to grant relief to young undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children. But a new rule would keep those same immigrants from federal health insurance coverage, putting some in an uncomfortable spot where they have permission to be here, but can't take advantage of all the programs available for others. Some who championed the new immigration policy expressed disappointment at the news, which was more in line with critics of the policy who say that this group should receive no benefits whatsoever because of their legal status. Five things to know about the big change in immigration policy . As many as 1.7 million immigrant youths may meet the criteria to be spared from deportation for a renewable two-year period, according to an estimate from the Pew Hispanic Center. The New York Times was the first to report about a little-noticed rule put in place by the Department of Health and Human Services, that excludes the beneficiaries of ""deferred status"" from the health insurance benefits. The Obama administration was clear that those who qualified for deferred action did not gain legal status in the United States, but would have ""lawful presence,"" which would allow them to work legally and opened the door for other benefits, like driver's licenses. But the HHS directive, published in the Federal Register, specifically excludes this group from the ""lawful presence"" category. The department determined that those with deferred status are not eligible for Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program. The HHS also stated that those with deferred status would not be eligible for health insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. What the Affordable Care Act means for you . The directive is effective immediately, before any deferred action recipients may apply for a temporary health insurance program for those with pre-existing conditions. ""It's disappointing that these youths won't be able to take advantage of the resources available to the rest of us under the Affordable Care Act,"" said Liliana Ranon, director of policy and legislation at the League of United Latin American Citizens. Those who need, but cannot receive, subsidies to purchase health insurance, are likely to turn to the more expensive option of going to the emergency room for health care, she said. Because deferred status grants the undocumented immigrants the ability to work, they would be eligible for insurance through their employers. But, Ranon says, not all jobs provide this benefit. Still, she is supportive of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, as the policy is known. Those who qualify remain in limbo, but they are in a better spot than they were in before, she said. ""We need to continue putting pressure on the administration and Congress to ensure they don't stay in limbo status,"" she said. The White House said that DACA is just a stopgap measure for those in the country illegally who were brought as children and pose no danger to national security or the public. ""It was never intended that those with deferred action under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals process would receive federal financial assistance for health care,"" Assistant Press Secretary Nick Papas said. Congress still must act to find a permanent solution to the issue of illegal immigration, he said. Obama defends record on immigration at Univision forum . There will be a cost to excluding deferred status immigrants from health benefits, said Adolph Falcon, senior vice president of the National Alliance for Hispanic Health. ""The whole purpose was to allow these youths to be a part of American life and convert that promise into economic contributors to society. An important part of that is a healthy workforce,"" he said. By not providing all resources to help this group get health insurance as youths, it creates unnecessary health risks for their future, he said. ""It's unfortunate because this is a group that is not expensive to cover at all,"" he said.

The White House says such benefits were never intended .
It leaves those with deferred action with permission to be here, but without all benefits ."
"(CNN) -- In a battle over healthier school lunches that pitted the Obama administration against school children, chalk up a point for the kids. Students have been complaining that some of their favorite foods were taken off the plate because of the Obama administration's efforts to make school lunches healthier. High school students in Kansas made a video called ""We Are Hungry,"" complete with feigned fainting that's been viewed more than a million times on YouTube. Last week, the administration reversed some of the new school lunch rules, and the kids are happy again, says Dave Porter, superintendent of Wallace County, Kansas, schools. ""Even though we're a small town in rural western Kansas, Washington did hear us,"" he said. ""Our concerns were listened to."" Under the original rules, which went into effect at the beginning of the school year, schools couldn't serve spaghetti and meatballs with garlic bread because it includes too many grains. A grilled chicken sandwich with a side order of celery sticks and a bit of peanut butter for dipping was also forbidden because it made for too many servings of protein. Now, garlic bread and peanut butter are back on the plate. ""These changes are wonderful. They give us back flexibility,"" said Sandra Ford, president of the national School Nutrition Association. Do you agree with the changes? Some of the original changes just didn't make sense, Ford said. For example, she had to stop serving her own students peanut butter and jelly sandwiches some days because the bread put her over the federal government's grain limit. ""Children cried,"" said Ford, director of food and nutrition services at Manatee County, Florida, schools. ""For some of them peanut butter and jelly sandwiches are all they would eat."" Video: 'No fat kids at school?' Schools still have to follow calorie limits and fruit and vegetable requirements that were part of the healthier school lunch changes. The secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers the school lunch program, said it anticipated some modifications would need to be made in the school lunch rules. ""USDA has asked for, and states and schools have provided us with, valuable feedback,"" Secretary Thomas Vilsack wrote in a letter last week to Sen. John Hoeven, R-North Dakota, who had expressed concern about the changes.","Students complained federal school lunch rules removed their favorites .

"(CNN) -- Iran's Cabinet has authorized the construction of another 10 uranium enrichment plants, its state news agency announced Sunday, further defying international calls to halt its production of nuclear fuel. The Iranian Cabinet approved existing plans for five more facilities similar to its current plant at Natanz and ordered planning for five more to begin, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported. The dispatch quoted Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as saying that the new plants will be used to produce fuel for civilian nuclear power stations. The move comes two days after the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N. nuclear watchdog, passed a resolution demanding that Iran stop construction on a previously secret nuclear facility at Qom. The agency also repeated calls for Iran to stop its uranium enrichment program. The IAEA said it would not comment on Sunday's announcement. But in Washington, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs called the announcement ""another example of Iran choosing to isolate itself."" ""The international community has made clear that Iran has rights, but with those rights come responsibilities,"" Gibbs said in a written statement. ""As the overwhelming IAEA board of governors vote made clear, time is running out for Iran to address the international community's growing concerns about its nuclear program."" Enriched uranium can be used to fuel power plants -- or, if enriched to a much higher concentration, it can be used to make a nuclear bomb. Iran has said its uranium enrichment program is aimed at producing fuel for civilian power plants. But the United States and other countries have accused Tehran of working toward nuclear weapons, and the IAEA's Friday resolution stated that Iran's refusal to comply with international demands ""does not contribute to the building of confidence."" The resolution had the support of Russia and China -- which had resisted earlier efforts to impose strong sanctions on Iran -- as well as the United States, Britain, France and Germany. The United States warned Friday that it was prepared to push for significantly stronger economic sanctions on Tehran following the resolution, but said Iran could receive benefits if it fully discloses all nuclear activities to the IAEA. Iran says it has a right to produce nuclear fuel under the 1968 Non-Proliferation Treaty, which bars member states from pursuing nuclear weapons and requires international inspectors to have access to nuclear facilities. ""We have friendly and kind relations with the whole world, but we will not allow even the slightest denial of Iran's rights,"" IRNA quoted Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as telling government ministers. And Iranian Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani criticized the IAEA resolution Sunday, warning that continued international pressure could force Iran ""to seek another path which will seriously change our cooperation with the agency,"" IRNA reported. Iran says the goal of the plants authorized Sunday would be to produce enough enriched uranium to yield about 20,000 megawatts of electricity a year. Iran currently has one nuclear power plant, which has yet to begin full operation, and announced plans in 2007 to build 19 more. By comparison, 65 nuclear power plants in the United States produced about 800,000 megawatts of power in 2007, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. In his final report to the IAEA's governing board, outgoing Director General Mohamed ElBaradei said the agency has been able to verify that no known stocks of nuclear fuel have been diverted from authorized uses. But he said inspectors ""have effectively reached a dead end"" without further Iranian cooperation. ""There has been no movement on remaining issues of concern which need to be clarified for the agency to verify the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear program,"" he said. In addition, Iran has so far refused to sign an agreement with France, Russia and the United States to send its uranium stocks abroad for enrichment in exchange for fuel for a research reactor that produces radioisotopes used for cancer treatment. In Israel, which has called Iran's nuclear program to the dominant threat facing the country, there was no immediate comment from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office on Sunday's development. Israel is believed to have its own nuclear arsenal, though it has never declared itself a nuclear power. CNN's Kevin Flower and Per Nyberg contributed to this report.","Iranian president says new plants will produce fuel for civilian power plants .

"(CNN) -- In the moments before his death, American James Foley stares into the camera, head held high, after being forced to read a script, in which he blames his death on the United States. A masked man wielding a knife then decapitates him. As horrifying as Foley's last moments were, it was not the first time Foley looked death in the face at the hands of ISIS. A new report from The New York Times states that Foley and other ISIS captives were threatened with execution, tortured and starved ahead of their beheadings. Foley had been singled out for particularly harsh treatment by the group that calls itself the Islamic State, according to the Times -- he was subject to beatings, waterboarding and ""mock executions."" The Times says it compiled the information by interviewing five former hostages, local witnesses, relatives and colleagues of the detainees, among others. Foley, a 40-year-old freelance journalist, was reporting for GlobalPost and Agence France Presse when he was abducted in 2012. He was the first Western hostage to be beheaded by ISIS on camera. After Foley, the militant group beheaded three other Western hostages -- Steven Sotloff, an American journalist who wrote for Time magazine; David Haines, a British aid worker; and Alan Henning, a British taxi driver who traveled to Syria to deliver food and water to those affected by the country's Civil War. American aid worker in Syria, Abdul Rahman Kassig, who served in the U.S. Army and was deployed to Iraq, was identified by ISIS as their next captive in line to be killed. British photojournalist John Cantlie is also being held by ISIS. He has narrated a series of apparently scripted propaganda videos for the Sunni militant group. Cantlie is one of three remaining Western hostages according to the Times, along with Kassig and a woman who has not been named. Most of the hostages who were released came from countries which the Times says has a history of paying ransoms. A report from the Times in July alleged that by paying ransoms, European countries have influenced terror groups, including ISIS, to target people for kidnapping.","The New York Times reports that ISIS tortured its captives before beheading them .

"Beijing (CNN) -- President Xi Jinping's campaign to punish corrupt Chinese officials has hit its biggest target. Zhou Yongkang, 71, who used to be one of the most powerful Communist Party politicians in China is now under investigation for corruption. For now, it is an intra-party investigation, a first step down a path that could lead to a criminal trial. The questions remain: Will Zhou's case be handed over to the criminal courts? Will there be a public trial? Many China watchers knew this was coming. There had been rumors that Zhou and his followers were being investigated. In fact, hundreds of senior party officials, state-company managers, and minister-level bureaucrats have been charged or are under investigation. Many of them are Zhou's protÃ©gÃ©s, political allies, and close relatives. We've seen a spate of anti-corruption purges since Xi came to power in 2012. But surely Zhou is the most senior party official to be put under investigation, even though he's now retired. Before he formally stepped down from his government posts in March 2013, he was in charge of China's security apparatus -- the police, the courts, the prosecutors, and the secret dossiers. The fact that the announcement of Zhou's investigation did not make a huge destabilizing impact in China shows that the public has been prepared for it, or the public has been made to believe that corruption is so pervasive amongst senior part officials that it is no longer shocking. Possible fallout . Corruption is a scourge in many countries, but it is especially rampant in China. Communist Party leaders have often acknowledged that corruption is so endemic that, in Xi's words, ""Corruption could lead to the collapse of the Party [Communist Party of China] and the downfall of the State [People's Republic of China]."" Some 182,000 officials were disciplined in 2013, while courts nationwide tried 23,000 corruption cases, according to the Communist Party's disciplinary commission. By targeting Zhou, Xi is showing his resolve to target not only ""flies"" (minor officials) but also ""tigers"" (senior officials). Xi is also breaking an unwritten rule that no member of the politburo standing committee, current or retired, is to be prosecuted. He's trying to show that there is no sacred cow that will be spared of punishment. But the question is: what will be the fallout? One possible scenario would be the destabilizing effect within the Communist Party, especially among senior officials who may think they could be the next targets. Is this move politically motivated simply to get rid of Xi's real or potential political enemies, and if so, could that trigger panic or destabilization within the Communist Party leadership? Another fallout of the anti-corruption campaign is amongst ordinary Chinese. While the campaign is popular amongst the masses in general, some Chinese are feeling hurt by it. Some are complaining that many fringe benefits that they used to get on the grassroots level -- such as annual bonuses, occasional dole-outs of foodstuff, group working meals -- have now been suspended by local officials who are afraid of being accused of misusing funds as these are grey-area expenses, or public expenditures. One local official in Beijing told me that even civil servants like him are complaining about this: ""Unless we are given legitimate salary increases, we are losing out to inflation and to undistributed fringe benefits. Our standard of living is slipping, and we are losing badly if this goes on longer."" These are just some of the unintended consequences of an otherwise popularly supported anti-corruption campaign. The ""sunshine law"" Of course, the biggest casualty of the ongoing campaign is the reputation of the Communist Party. Put simply, the party's image is tarnished with each case lodged against a high-profile official. Will these periodic hunts for ""flies"" and ""tigers"" fundamentally clean up China of graft and corruption? Some analysts inside and outside China doubt it. They believe that unless and until Xi pushes for systemic reform of the political and social system, corruption will remain endemic. Such a reform, they say, would entail measures that will institutionalize transparency and accountability within the system, including the Communist Party, the government, in business, and in people's daily lives. They believe that, for example, much of the official graft can be curbed if China can institute a system whereby the salaries, assets, and liabilities of officials -- and their spouses and children -- are declared every year and are made public. Since the 1990s, China has been deliberating drafts of a so-called ""sunshine law"" precisely to achieve that goal. Some provinces and a few ministries have reportedly been following such a system on a ""pilot"" basis. But over the years, such disclosures have been kept within the Communist Party, with no public access, which defeats the purpose. True reform . Another institutional change needed is an independent judiciary and an independent anti-corruption body, which can dispense justice fairly, free from control and interference of the Communist Party and other vested interests. Otherwise, the Communist Party will remain the accuser, investigator, prosecutor and judge, rolled into one. Just as important, China needs to have a robust and independent media that can scrutinize officials' behavior and blow the whistle when they sniff corruption. Some are already doing that, but at the risk of official retribution or censorship. China must encourage and protect the whistleblowers, instead of intimidating or jailing them. All these measures can help create an institutionalized ""check-and-balance"" to curb corruption. The Communist Party Politburo met a few days ago to put forth its collective approval for the decision to investigate Zhou Yongkang. The group also decided that the 350-strong Central Committee will meet in Beijing in October. At the top of the agenda is how to promote the rule of law. And that shows the quest for a clean Chinese government and a clean Communist Party that is governed by the rule of law, remains a work in progress.","Zhou Yongkang became the most senior official to be ensnared in China's anti-corruption campaign .
Are other senior officials worried that they may become the next target?
True reform will take a lot more than laying graft charges on individuals ."
"Beijing (CNN) -- An expatriate corporate detective based in Beijing and Shanghai, who worked with GlaxoSmithKline's under-fire Chinese wing, could soon discover the cost of allegedly falling afoul of China's often hazy corporate law. After more than a year in detention, Briton Peter Humphrey and his wife Yu Yingzeng, a U.S. citizen, stand trial in a Shanghai court Friday, charged with illegally obtaining private information. Their 19-year-old son, who has returned to mainland China for the trial, says he's not convinced that, even if the couple is found guilty, they would even have known they were breaking the law. Humphrey is a veteran corporate detective -- an investigator, similar to a private detective, but one which sniffs out corporate malfeasance -- who spent more than 20 years as a foreign correspondent with Reuters, including stints in Beijing and Eastern Europe. ChinaWhys, the investigations company that Yu and Humphrey established, mainly catered to foreign companies and multinationals, such as pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), assisting in assessing corporate risks, conducting background checks and investigating allegations of corruption and fraud. It is a business fraught with risks, especially in a country like China, where even innocuous information is often classified as secret or confidential. 'Fully aware of risks' The couple was detained on July 10, 2013 at their Shanghai office, and charged this year with illegally purchasing confidential information -- a serious allegation akin to espionage -- and operating an illegal business. On July 10, Chinese police raided their home in Beijing. It was not until two days later that their son, Harvey Humphrey, who was undertaking an internship in Hong Kong at that time, managed to establish what befell his parents. ""They were fully aware of the risks that such a business carries,"" he told CNN. ""But usually the risks are very small. The repercussions do not usually take place on the investigators. I guess this time they were definitely caught off guard. I think they were caught in the wrong place at the wrong time, and with the wrong client possibly as well."" Humphrey believes the case is linked to his father's client, GSK, which is under investigation in China amid allegations raised by a whistleblower. ""I would address the cause of the whole event which is GSK taking them on and not giving them the information they needed to do their investigations,"" he said. ""It's effectively misleading them into a dangerous situation."" In response to CNN's request for comment, GSK referred CNN back to its July 3 statement. GSK hired Humphrey's firm ""in April 2013 to conduct an investigation following a serious breach of privacy and security related to the company's China general manager."" ""They were not hired to investigate the substance of the allegations of misconduct made by the whistle-blower."" Chinese authorities have not said that the charges are related to the work Humphrey and Yu did for the pharmaceutical giant. The company has come under scrutiny by Chinese authorities. On May 14 this year, Chinese police in a report accused GSK executives in China of presiding over a web of corruption and bribery. ""Our China business is now subject to an ongoing investigation by the Chinese authorities with which we are fully cooperating,"" GSK said in its statement. ""We have also hired an external law firm, Ropes and Gray, to conduct an independent review into what happened in our China business during this period."" Last August, Peter Humphrey appeared on Chinese national television handcuffed and wearing orange prison vest to make an unusual ""confession."" But his son says the confession may have been made under duress. ""I was quite upset by it as anyone not used to this sort of situation would be,"" he said. ""I didn't understand why it was done, personally. It might have been done because they probably thought it could help to find some leniency. But it was quite humiliating."" The elder Humphrey and his wife could not be reached for comment. Are parents innocent or guilty? ""I think it's highly likely they're innocent, but the charge, I believe, is obtaining private information and it's a very gray area of the law,"" the couple's son continues ""It's not been very well established in China. It's theoretically possible they broke that law without even knowing it existed."" The Chinese authorities insist that the case is being prosecuted with all due care. ""China's judicial authorities are handling the relevant case according to law,"" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei told a daily news briefing in July this year. ""China is a country with rule of law."" But the younger Humphrey notes a shift in the way Chinese authorities are handling the case -- he was allowed to visit his parents in jail, for instance. ""I was told by the U.S. Consular officer that to have a foreigner make a pre-trial visit to someone has never happened before since China opened up,"" said Humphrey, who is a dual U.S.-UK citizen. The authorities have dropped other, more serious, charges -- initially the couple was charged with buying the information, rather than only obtaining it, and of operating an illegal business. Further, the trial, which opened Friday, will be public, not secret as earlier reported. . Deteriorating health . Thirteen months in jail, Humphrey said, had taken its toll on his parents' health. ""Physically they looked aged, especially my mother,"" Humphrey said. ""She looked a lot younger than her age before this. I think she looks her age now. And it all boils down to how their health was in prison."" His father, he said, suffers from a hernia, as well as compression fractures in his spine. The couple are locked in separate cells in a Shanghai prison. Each shares a cell with six or seven inmates, all foreigners, according to the son. ""The visit last Friday was much more emotional for them than it was for me,"" Humphrey says. ""I didn't feel that happy about being able to visit. Obviously it's a positive, but my end goal is to get them released and nothing is going to make me deviate from that path."" He plans to attend the Friday trial along with a relative and consular representatives from the U.S. and UK, but says he will not be surprised if his parents are found guilty. Defense strategy . He says he believes it will be easier if his parents plead guilty -- even if they've done nothing wrong. ""I'm hoping it will be a situation where they plead guilty and they go for a mitigation defense strategy, and just try to make it as lenient a sentencing as possible."" Regardless of the court verdict, Humphrey said that he is proud of them for ""holding up as long as they have. ""And I'm proud that they've tried to run such a business. Their whole standpoint was to cut down on corruption as much as they can wherever they could find it. ""That was the motivation to do this business. It's a very stressful business so in that sense I'm very proud of their moral standing."" READ MORE: China bars Glaxo exec from leaving country .

"(CNN) -- Was Tyrannosaurus rex a predator or scavenger? The question has been a point of controversy in the scientific community for more than a century. ""You see 'Jurassic Park,' and you see T. rex as this massive hunter and killer, as incredibly vicious. But scientists have argued for 100 years that he was too big and too slow to hunt prey and that he was probably a scavenger, an animal that feeds only on dead things,"" University of Kansas paleontologist David Burnham said. Burnham and researcher Robert DePalma got what Burnham described as his ""lucky break"" when they found the fossil of a duckbill dinosaur's tail with a tooth in it. ""The features of the tooth are like fingerprints, and we were able to identify it as T. rex,"" he said. They took the fossil to be analyzed at the University of Kansas and for a CT scan at the local hospital, where the doctor told them, ""It's too late for your patient."" But Burnham was thrilled at what the fossilized bones told him about the life of the duckbill. ""We were giddy like schoolkids,"" he said. ""This now returns T. rex as a predator. So the monsters that we see in dinosaurs are real. They did go chasing after things, kill them and eat them. They actively pursued live prey."" The mystery was solved. ""Our evidence is new because we have a T. rex tooth inside a duckbill dinosaur, that bit it so hard and so viciously that the tooth broke off, the duckbill dinosaur got away, and over the next few years, the wound healed,"" Burnham explained. He determined that the duckbill lived long after the attack by comparing the time it took for the bone to heal around the wound with studies done on modern animals. ""Before our evidence, everybody was looking at bite marks and tooth punctures on dinosaur bones and using that evidence for both theories of predation and scavenging. They were using the same bit of evidence to argue both sides,"" Burnham said. For Burnham, the discovery brought to life the behaviors of these legendary creatures and proved the T. rex's place in the prehistoric world. ""Here is T. rex, one of the biggest animals ever known, 5-foot-long skull, 40 feet long nose to tail and weighed 7 tons. What were these guys doing in the ecosystem? Now we know they were the top feeders."" The full study is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

"Auckland, New Zealand (CNN) -- It was a busy weekend, but Kim Dotcom was feeling relaxed. He was in boyish good spirits as around 150 contractors buzzed around his mansion and its acres of grounds, building a giant ""Mega"" sign on the front lawn and erecting a mobile stage that production company MadAnt says is New Zealand's largest. He mugged for the camera and joked ""it's another raid"" as a helicopter flew overhead. The world's most controversial Internet tycoon was preparing to launch his site at 6:48am on Sunday morning -- a year to the minute after his New Zealand mansion was raided and his old service was shut down by the authorities. (Some press, including Ars Technica, received an early look at the site.) Ars Technica freelancer Chris Keall spoke with Dotcom on January 18 at his mansion outside Auckland, discussing topics ranging from Mega's business model to legal threats that may come back to bite his business. ""I would have the same fears"" In its heyday, Megaupload had around 50 million unique users -- none of whom have regained access to their files since the site was taken offline. We put the most obvious question to Dotcom first: why should users trust him with their data at all? Wouldn't it be legitimate for users to be spooked by Mega, and refuse to go near it? ""You are certainly right,"" Dotcom conceded. ""If I [were] a user of Megaupload, I would probably have the same fears. There will be users who chose not to work with us because of that, and that is unfortunate."" But Dotcom hopes that enough users will value the service he's offering: all-encrypted storage that can't be opened by anyone—even the host. He knows there will be a lot of people coming to check things out in the weeks to come and first impressions matter. ""There will also be a lot of users who just want to try this new service and see how good it is,"" he said. ""Once they realize there is really no alternative to this service right now in terms of safety and privacy, I think there will be a lot of users who will use this. And over time, you know, when the service is live for a few months and people see these guys are still here, I think the trust will grow."" The jovial pre-launch atmosphere is only broken when Dotcom and his lawyer Ira Rothken are reminded that this week U.S. prosecutors have raised the possibility of fresh charges if the Mega launch goes ahead—an act that could be interpreted as violating a key bail condition Dotcom signed in by affidavit: not to relaunch Mega, or a similar service. Rothken angrily rejects the notion that Dotcom is violating bail conditions. ""Mr. Dotcom is working in consultation with top notch NZ defense counsel on bail compliance,"" he said. ""[He] is innocent, is presumed innocent, and is entitled to innovate and work in technology like any other innocent New Zealander especially when the U.S. takes away all his assets and delays the extradition proceedings."" Nothing in Dotcom's bail conditions or US law precludes his engaging in lawful business, including Internet and technology businesses, said Rothken. Embracing even the ""smallest, most unreliable"" hosts . The Mega business plan will be a distributed model, with hundreds of companies large and small, around the world, hosting files. A hosting company can be huge or it can own just two or three servers Dotcom says—just as long as it's located outside the U.S. ""Each file will be kept with at least two different hosters, [in] at least two different locations,"" said Dotcom. ""That's a great added benefit for us because you can work with the smallest, most unreliable [hosting] companies. It doesn't matter because they can't do anything with that data."" More than 1,000 hosts answered a request for expressions of interest on the Mega home page. Dotcom says several hundred will be active partners within months. Successful hosts will get paid E500 per month per server; each server needs to supply 24 hard drives with 72 terabytes of storage and one gigabit of bandwidth, among other requirements. That's all down the road, however. For now, Mega is launching with just one, professional, hosting operator—a subsidiary of Cogent, based in Dotcom's home country of Germany. Dotcom says he needed a rock-solid setup for the launch and an operator who could rapidly scale if traffic and hosting requirements suddenly go through the roof after the January 20 launch (he had hoped to have a server rack operating in New Zealand for the launch as well, but says capacity on the Telecom/Singtel/Verizon-owned Southern Cross Cable was prohibitive). The Washington DC-based, Nasdaq-listed Cogent was one of the suppliers of infrastructure and hosting services to Megaupload before its 2012 take-down. According to the indictment, Megaupload was paying Cogent around $1 million a month to lease ""approximately thirty-six computer servers in Washington, DC and France."" It was a substantial contract, although one that was dwarfed by that of Virginia-based Carpathia Hosting, where the bulk of Megaupload files were hosted, and are still stranded. Cogent's fate was closely enough tied to Megaupload that its shares dropped 23 percent in a day after last year's raid, from $19.20 to $15.43. By mid-March, however, the stock had rebounded strongly; it closed recently at $24.11. Having Cogent back on board is a source of pride for Dotcom; a major public hosting company has made a vote of confidence in his business plan for Mega. He was about to go into further detail on Cogent's hosting operation in Germany when his lawyer Ira Rothken—in Auckland for the launch and sitting in on the interview—stopped him, citing security concerns if the specific location was revealed. Launching the most lawyered-up startup in tech history . The Mega business plan has been vetted by more than 20 lawyers across the US and New Zealand, Dotcom says—including those at Rothken's firm, and New Zealand law firms Simpson Grierson (one of the largest corporate law firms in NZ) and Lowndes Jordan (an intellectual property specialist). Also on Team Mega are two independent lawyers capable of handling the most difficult work: Queen's Counsel Paul Davison (often cited as the most expensive lawyer in New Zealand) and Guyon Foley—a criminal lawyer who made his mark prosecuting cases for the police before ""switching sides,"" so to speak. ""This startup is probably the most scrutinized by lawyers in the history of tech startups,"" Dotcom claims. Dotcom says it's inevitable Hollywood and music labels will ""heckle"" Mega ""going by their past aggression ... they can't help themselves"" (and there was certainly a foretaste of possible trouble to come this week as Mediaworks, which owns one of the two big radio networks in NZ, pulled ads for Mega from its stations; an insider said the move followed pressure from music and movie advertisers). Rothken says anybody who comes after Mega has no case. ""You have companies like Dropbox and Google with Drive with materially similar technologies, and they are in business and they're thriving—and Mega adds encryption,"" he says. But doesn't encryption add a sinister edge? After all, encryption means Mega will be like the Swiss bank of online storage services; customers could easily use the technology to hide, say, pirated movies or child porn. Rothken responds that many technologies have dual uses, but on balance provide more public good. That's how the VCR stayed on the market, despite facilitating video piracy. The same argument applies to cloud computing as a whole, he says. For good measure, Rothken also notes that former Deputy Homeland Security Advisor Richard Falkenrath wrote about encryption as a desirable feature for cloud computing services (""You don't really need to know where your data is. As long as you know it is safely wrapped in an at-rest encryption cocoon, you should feel secure,"" the advisor wrote.) Dotcom adds in that although other services don't have a one-click encryption option built into their interface, the likes of Google Drive allow you to upload encrypted, password-protected files. Dotcom and Rothken's arguments are well rehearsed and, on the face of things, have a solid logic. But Dotcom, by his own admission, says the apparent movie and music industry push against the Mega radio ads was an ""emotional reaction"" from the content industry. Those feelings remain. Even with the best precautions, attempts to shut down Mega—and shut up Dotcom—are unlikely to stop.

"Marikana, South Africa (CNN) -- The headlines Friday in South Africa spoke of a bloodbath, of war. The morning after carnage at a platinum mine, South Africans grappled with shock, memories of an ugly era resurrected in their minds. The word apartheid surfaced again as people debated the need for such police force. The police, meanwhile, explained themselves at a news conference, giving reporters the grim toll: 34 mine workers killed, 78 others wounded, 259 arrested on various charges, including malicious damage to property, armed robbery, illegal gathering and possession of weapons. That according to Police Commissioner Riah Phiyega. She said police ""were forced to utilize maximum force to defend themselves."" South African President Jacob Zuma cut short a trip to Mozambique to visit the scene of the shootings Friday afternoon. He announced the government will open an inquiry of the incident. He told South Africans that they must come together to overcome national challenges as they had done before. ""This is not a day to apportion blame,"" Zuma said. ""It is a day for us to mourn together as a nation. It is also a day to start healing."" Mourn, yes, but also a time to think about what had been done, some cried. Rising tensions explode into grisly violence at South African mine . ""African lives cheap as ever,"" read a headline in a Soweto newspaper. It editorialized that South Africa's economic woes do require a war. ""But a different kind of war -- a war of ideas. Not a war that dispenses with human life in as cheaply a manner as we have seen in Marikana."" The tragedy began unfolding a week ago when miners went on strike demanding pay hikes at the mine near Rustenburg, about two hours northwest of Johannesburg. They were rock drillers who worked at the dangerous depths of the mine, their bodies vibrating for the duration of their eight-hour shifts. ""When there is a rock fall, it is generally the drillers who are the victims,"" wrote journalist Greg Marinovich in the Daily Maverick newspaper. ""It is the most dangerous job in the business."" The miners, who earned $300 to $500 a month, wanted their salaries raised to $1,500. It came as no surprise that their multi-national employer, Lonmin, said no to the whopping increase. The world's third-largest producer of platinum said the strike was illegal. The larger problem, however, went beyond a wage dispute. It had to do with a vicious rivalry between two unions -- the dominant and established National Union of Mineworkers and the splinter Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union which has been encroaching on the former's role. What's behind the Marikana massacre? The National Union of Mineworkers is a close ally of the country's ruling African National Congress. The miners, according to several South African media outlets, feel they are not adequately represented by the battling unions. They say politics gets in the way and that each union vies for miners' support and yet they don't always seek their best interests. In January, at least three people were killed during a strike at the world's second-largest platinum mine, Impala Platinum. The violence there, too, was blamed on union rivalry. The two unions, accused of trying to outdo each other in negotiating wages, denied instigating the clashes. Tensions at Marikana had mounted throughout the week. The striking miners carried traditional panga machetes and gathered Thursday around a small hill. Police carried anti-riot equipment and encircled the protesting workers. By then, at least 10 other people were dead from incidents that had occurred in the days before. Among them were two police officers who were hacked to death. Journalists who were at Marikana said police seemed fed up with the miners and determined to resolve the issue. ""Yesterday the police were clear that today we are going to disarm them and remove them from the hill because the gathering is illegal,"" said Xolile Mngambi, a reporter for CNN affiliate ETV. By Thursday afternoon, another round of negotiations among the striking miners, the unions and Lonmin had failed. The miners chanted war songs, witnesses said. A heavily armed police Tactical Response Team moved in to disperse the miners. What happened next is unclear. How diamonds, mining fuel Africa's conflicts . To hear Phiyega, the police commissioner, describe it, the police weighed all their options and decided to fence in the miners with barbed wire -- to compartmentalize them into more manageable groups. She defended police actions, saying it was a desperate last measure against dangerous protesters. ""The armed protesters moved toward the police,"" she said. ""They were driven back with tear gas and rubber bullets. But when they fired, police used maximum force."" But journalists at the scene could not say whether the protesters fired first. ""We cannot say to you the police were provoked,"" Mngambi said. Then, the police unleashed a barrage of gunfire. One witness said it went on for three minutes. Men dropped to the ground. Some lay motionless; others were still moving. Blood spilled onto the parched earth. The images spread fast on the news, on the Internet. Marikana was one of the bloodiest incidents since apartheid ended in 1994. South Africans were taken back to that time of mandated racial separation and horrific incidents of police brutality against black people. Some likened Marikana to Sharpeville, where in 1960, police fired on a crowd of black demonstrators, killing 69. There was clear evidence, the South African Institute for Race Relations said, that policemen randomly shot into the crowd with rifles and handguns. ""There is also evidence of their continuing to shoot after a number of bodies can be seen dropping and others turning to run. This is reminiscent of the Sharpeville massacre in 1960. ""In our view,"" the institute said, ""what happened at Lonmin is completely unacceptable. We hold no brief for the use of violence in labor or any other disputes. But even if the police were provoked or shot at during yesterday's incident, or were angry at the killing of two police officers in the days before, no disciplined and properly trained policeman would shoot into a crowd. Yesterday's incident was a disaster waiting to happen."" Marikana, said some, exposed deep-rooted problems that have been bubbling in South Africa. ""I think this us a sign of underlying structural issues which you have seen in South Africa for a long time,"" said Mark Rosenberg, an Africa analyst with the risk research firm Eurasia Group. ""There has been an increase in violent protests both by miners and also by citizens living in townships who are upset with the level and pace of service delivery,"" he said. People are no longer willing to sit and wait around for the African National Congress to deliver. ""They are becoming more and more impatient and they're becoming more and more violent as a result,"" Rosenberg said. Lonmin's chief financial officer, Simon Scott, called the situation ""tragic"" and expressed condolences to the family and friends of the workers and police officers who died this week. He said the company would assist with funerals and grief counseling. Scott said Lonmin has worked for years to achieve good labor relations and said the ""illegal strike we've seen is so disappointing and damaging."" ""If the industry continues to be damaged by illegal actions it is not just the economy which suffers, but all our employees, their families and dependents,"" Scott said about South Africa's vital mining sector. ""We need our employees to come back to work and we need to get mining again."" But Friday at Marikana, all was quiet. The Lonmin mine remained shut. On the dry, dusty surrounding streets, a heavy police presence remained. And women searched desperately for husbands, fathers and brothers who did not come home. A 9-year-old boy said he saw his father shot on television. One of the miners, who did not want to be identified, told CNN that none of the mine workers fired at police. But regardless of whether their actions were legal or illegal, he said, none of this should have happened. ""They should not have died,"" he said. ""All they want is a wage increase."" He said he thought South Africa was a democracy, a nation of free people. But it didn't feel that way this week at Marikana.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A truck carrying fireworks on an expressway bridge in central China exploded Friday, causing part of the bridge to collapse and sending dozens of vehicles plunging off the edge, authorities said. The exact number of casualties wasn't immediately clear. Highway police in Henan province, where the explosion happened, said on their official microblog account that at least 11 people had been killed. But that post was later deleted and replaced with one that gave the lower total being reported by Xinhua, the official state news agency. By late Friday afternoon, Xinhua was citing local authorities as saying that eight people had been killed. The state-run China National Radio had earlier reported on its website that as many as 26 people had died in the disaster. It didn't say where it got the information from. Authorities have closed the expressway while search and rescue efforts are under way, Xinhua reported, and 13 injured people have been retrieved from the wreckage so far. At least 25 vehicles are believed to have fallen off the bridge to the ground about 30 meters (100 feet) below, Xinhua said. State broadcaster CCTV carried footage of a yawning gap in one part of the bridge, with mounds of debris, including rubble and parts of vehicles, spread out below . Rescue workers in bright orange overalls clambered over upturned trucks, looking for survivors. Xinhua said an 80-meter (260-foot) stretch of the bridge had collapsed after the explosion, which occurred at 8:52 a.m. local time in Mianchi County. China's fireworks tradition . Fireworks are an enduring element of celebrations of the Lunar New Year in China, one of the country's most important holidays that takes place this month.

According to local folklore, fireworks drive away monsters and evil spirits. But under Mao they were prohibited, ostensibly on the basis that they were ""bourgeois"" and a ""waste of money."" Beijing authorities on Friday urged residents to set off fewer fireworks during this year's Lunar New Year celebrations to avoid exacerbating the thick pollution that has cloaked the capital for much of the past month, Xinhua reported.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Look up at any presidential event and you're likely to see them: men dressed in black, armed to the teeth, looking back. Countersniper teams ""will be familiar with every potential threat,"" according to the Secret Service. It's no secret; they're with the Secret Service. On Tuesday at the inauguration, members of the U.S. Secret Service's elite countersniper unit will be out in force, taking  roof-top positions along Pennsylvania Avenue and elsewhere as the presidential motorcade glides past throngs of people for the swearing in of Barack Obama. The Secret Service doesn't mind you knowing they are up there. In fact, their mere presence at the inauguration has a deterrent effect, they say. But they are mum about many other details, including how many teams will be deployed, how long they work and about their custom firearms.  Watch countersniper detail up-close » . Unit commander Lt. Bernard Hall jokingly calls the weapon a JAR -- ""Just Another Rifle."" Since the unit formed in 1971, the unit has never had to fire a JAR to safeguard a person they are assigned to protect. ""When you look at that parade on the day of the inauguration, every building that we will pass by ... has been surveyed, and that is done by the Countersniper Team,"" said Secret Service director Mark Sullivan. ""They will be familiar with every building; they will be familiar with every potential threat."" But the absence of gunfire -- a welcome absence in this line of work -- doesn't mean they have never identified or mitigated a threat, Sullivan says. The teams typically consist of two people, both armed with high-powered rifles, either of whom can shoot to deter an imminent threat. If one countersniper spots a threat, that person prepares to shoot while the other member takes on the role of ""wind caller,"" telling the shooter how to adjust his aim to counteract the wind. The wind caller takes cues from chimney smoke, flags or undulations from the atmosphere. At a firing range outside of Washington, the team demonstrates its skills in a variety of positions. Both men peer through high-powered binoculars looking for threats. ""Watch the threat area,"" an instructor shouts. Thirty seconds pass before a target pops up down range. One of the countersnipers drops his binoculars and reaches for his weapon, shouting to his colleague. ""Left side. Left side,"" the wind reader responds. The shooter fires one shot. ""Center! In the middle,"" the instructor reports. While the countersnipers can scan the crowds below, their focus is on looking for places where snipers might be concealed, team members say. All countersnipers go through nine weeks of intense training. Half of those who try out for the team fail. Fewer than 200 people have been assigned to the unit in its 30-plus year history, the service says. There are fewer than 100 countersnipers in the unit, a Secret Service spokesman says. This isn't a job for someone who can't handle extreme temperatures. The cold can be biting; the heat, blistering. Hall said officers have tricks for keeping mental focus in inclement weather. ""When it's hot, we're probably thinking about the cold days in January. When it's cold, we're probably thinking about August,"" he said. On Tuesday, in addition to the snipers, an estimated 8,000 police officers will be on duty, along with almost 1,000 FBI personnel, Transportation Security Administration screeners and others, including 10,000 National Guard troops. The Department of Homeland Security has said that another 20,000 members of the National Guard are being held in reserve. ""I think we are ready,"" said Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff.

"Washington (CNN) -- As President Barack Obama gets ready on Wednesday to spell out White House proposals to curb gun violence, three new national polls indicate a majority of Americans support most gun control measures. But they are divided by political party, gender, age, race and education over some of the proposals. The polls released this week came one month after a gunman killed 26 people, including 20 children, at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. The tragedy seemed to be make an impact. By a 51%-45% margin, Americans questioned in a new Pew Research Center poll say it's more important to control gun ownership than to protect gun rights. An equal 51% questioned in a new United Technologies/National Journal Congressional Connection survey say controlling gun ownership is more important than protecting the right of Americans to own firearms. And by a 52%-35% margin, a new ABC News/Washington Post survey indicates the public says it is more likely to support some forms of gun control after last month's massacre. Support for gun control rose after last summer's mass shooting at an Aurora, Colorado, theater and the January 2011 shooting of then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and others in Arizona but not at the same rate as after the Newtown tragedy. Obama to announce gun control plans Wednesday . But the country is still divided on the issue. ""Support for gun control is rising modestly since last month's shootings, but still largely divides the country close to 50-50,"" CNN Senior Political Analyst and National Journal Group's Editorial Director Ron Brownstein said. And that split follows the same track demographically as the split in last November's presidential election. ""There is strong support for action on guns inside the modern Democratic coalition of minorities, millenials and college educated white women and strong opposition among blue-collar and rural white voters,"" Brownstein added. ""At the national level that means Democrats were wrong to conclude this issue was a loser after Vice President Al Gore was defeated in the 2000 election. Democrats were paralyzed by the fear of losing voters they had largely already lost and failing to respond to the voters who actually vote for them."" The divide is also apparent when it comes to specific proposals to limit gun violence that are being considered by the president. White House press secretary Jay Carney said Tuesday that Obama would spell out his proposals on gun-control legislation and executive actions on Wednesday. NRA membership up 250K in last month . According to the Pew survey, 85% of the public backs making private gun sales and purchases at gun shows subject to background checks, with comparable support across party lines. It's a similar story in an ABC News/Washington Post poll, where nearly nine in 10 favor such background checks, with broad backing from Democrats, Republicans and independent voters. The Pew poll indicates that eight in 10 favor laws to prevent mentally ill people from purchasing guns, again with bipartisan support. And a United Technologies/National Journal Congressional Connection survey finds nearly six in 10 backing the banning of bullets that explode or penetrate bulletproof vests, with majority support across party lines. But on other proposals where there is overall majority support, such as creating a federal database to track gun sales, bans on assault style weapons, high capacity ammunition clips, and online ammunition sales, the polls indicate wide differences of opinions between Democrats and Republicans. The president says when it comes to gun violence, he's not concerned about politics. ""My starting point is not to worry about the politics but to focus on what makes sense and what works,"" Obama said at a Monday news conference. But the polls indicate that the divides on the issue are not just Democrat vs. Republican. New York to pass nation's first gun control bill since Newtown shooting . The National Journal poll indicates that those ages 18-29 are most supportive of stricter gun control, and that minorities overwhelmingly favor prioritizing gun control over gun owners rights, with 52% of white respondents saying protecting gun ownership is most important. The Pew survey indicates that men are divided on this question, while a solid majority of women say it's more important to control gun ownership. There's also a sizable gender gap over a ban on semi-automatic weapons, with two-thirds of women supporting such a move and men divided. According to the ABC News/Washington Post poll, 44% say there is at least one gun in their home, and that those people are less supportive of a number of the anti-gun violence measures being proposed. The powerful National Rifle Association is fiercely opposed to any ban on assault-style weapons. The ABC News/Washington Post poll indicates 36% of the public has favorable views of the group's leaders, with 44% saying they have an unfavorable view, and one in five saying they have no opinion on the NRA's leaders. Thirty-eight percent say the NRA has ""too much influence,"" with 24% feeling it has ""too little"" influence, and three in ten saying the organization has the right amount of sway. Last month the NRA proposed placing armed security guards or police in the nation's schools. Fifty-five percent of those questioned in the ABC News/Washington Post survey and nearly two-thirds of those questioned in the Pew poll support that suggestion. But the Pew survey highlights an educational divide on the question. Fewer than half of college graduates support a proposal to put armed guards or police in more schools, while three-quarters of those with no more than a high school education favor the idea.

"(CNN) -- Have English Premier League club Sunderland's players set a dangerous precedent for under-performing sports teams? After losing 8-0 at Southampton on Saturday, Sunderland's squad has offered to refund the cost of match tickets to their 2,500 traveling supporters who made the 1,026 kilometer round trip from the north east of England to the south coast.

"(CNN) -- There's a big difference between a political debate about same-sex marriage and the recent hard-fought court challenge to the California ban, Proposition 8. In politics, anything goes: Vague, sinister comments about same-sex marriage threatening children or undermining the sanctity of heterosexual marriage were prevalent during the Prop 8 campaign. In court, same-sex marriage opponents needed solid evidence to back up these and other claims. Despite ""able and energetic counsel,"" they never produced it. That's why they lost, resoundingly, in the federal district court. And that lack of evidence should dog opponents up through the chain of appeals that is now beginning, because appellate courts are required to review only the evidence in the court record and to give great deference to Judge Vaughn Walker's findings of fact. He was there, after all, presiding over the trial, and the appellate judges weren't. And what a lopsided trial he presided over. All the anti-same-sex marriage arguments imploded when subjected to the rules of evidence. ""You don't have to have evidence of this point,"" counsel responded to the judge's question asking what support existed for their claim that ""responsible procreation is really at the heart of society's interest in regulating marriage."" No, sorry, at trial, you do have to have evidence. Of this point and every point. (And since -- as even Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia once pointed out in another case -- the sterile and elderly are allowed to marry, it can't be all about procreation.) Trials turn on admissible evidence -- primarily credible witness testimony or documents, in this type of case. And Prop 8 proponents did not have it. Over and over again, Walker's decision focused on the evidence, the mountain of reliable facts offered by gay marriage advocates, and the glaring lack thereof proffered by gay marriage opponents. The same-sex-marriage advocates presented eight lay witnesses and nine expert witnesses. One plaintiff testified that marriage would be a way to tell ""our friends, our family ... that this is a lifetime commitment ... we are not girlfriends. We are not partners. We are married."" The other three presented similarly compelling, credible testimony about the damage to their dignity, the economic losses, the sting of discrimination they suffered daily due to their legally enshrined second-class citizenship. Opponents offered exactly zero lay witnesses to explain, say, how their heterosexual marriages would be undermined by same-sex marriage, or how children would be harmed by a neighbor's same-sex marriage -- though these were central arguments made during the Prop 8 campaign. The evidence at trial proved that children raised by gay or lesbian couples are just as likely to be well-adjusted as children raised by heterosexual parents. That gay folks are no more likely to be child molesters than heterosexuals. That marriage has evolved in this country to allow for women's equality and interracial marriage. That no ""undermining"" of straight marriage would occur if marriage further evolved to allow same-sex couples to marry, too. This evidence was put forward by an impressive roster of Harvard and Yale marriage historians, UMass Amherst and UCLA School of Law economists, a UCLA psychology professor, a Columbia University epidemiologist, a psychologist and a political scientist. Many had written extensive peer-reviewed articles and books in their areas of expertise. All their testimony withstood full and fair cross-examination. On the other side, pretrial, same-sex marriage opponents had designated a number of witnesses. But when push came to shove, at trial they elected not to call most of them. Walker pointed out that they didn't call a single official proponent of Prop 8 to explain the discrepancies between the arguments in favor of Prop 8 presented to voters and the arguments presented in court. Ouch. In a nice trial ""gotcha"" moment, gay marriage advocates read in deposition testimony from two witnesses who were to testify for the other side -- yet their pretrial testimony instead supported the gay marriage advocates. Opponents offered no explanation for why their witnesses flipped. Another embarrassment. Ultimately, same-sex marriage opponents called only two witness, the founder of the Institute for American Values, who the court found lacked qualifications to offer expert testimony, and a Claremont College professor, who ""sought to rebut only a limited aspect"" of the plaintiffs' case. Here's the kind of ""evidence"" gay marriage opponents offered at trial: Homosexuals are 12 times more likely to molest children, their witness argued, and allowing same-sex marriage would cause states ""to fall into Satan's hands."" The witness' source of information? ""The internet."" There's not a judge in this country who could rely on ""evidence"" like that. Walker made 80 meticulous, detailed findings of fact on every aspect of marriage, with hundreds of citations to the evidence cited at trial. Perhaps the most critical finding was No. 58: ""Proposition 8 places the force of law behind stigmas against gays and lesbians, including ... gays and lesbians are not as good as heterosexuals."" Ultimately, Walker found, that was the heart of what same-sex marriage opponents advanced: ""a desire to advance the belief that opposite-sex couples are morally superior to same-sex couples."" Constitutionally, in a country that guarantees all Americans ""equal protection"" of the laws, that is unacceptable. Given all these detailed evidentiary findings that follow ineluctably from the marriage opponents' failure to put on much of a case at all, and given Walker's finding that Prop 8 violated two separate constitutional provisions -- the due process and equal protection clauses -- it will be extremely difficult for an appellate court, following well-established rules of deference to lower court findings, to reverse. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Lisa Bloom.","Lisa Bloom says political arguments don't necessarily hold up in court .

"(CNN) -- Comatose for seven years, Israel's iconic former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon is showing ""significant brain activity."" The 84-year-old suffered a devastating stroke January 4, 2006, and a brain hemorrhage. He was presumed to be in a vegetative state. But on Monday, a team of surprised neuroscientists and doctors said Sharon's brain appeared to respond when they showed him pictures of his family and had him listen to his son's voice. Doctors also used tactile stimuli to measure Sharon's reaction. Does this mean the man Israelis once dubbed the ""Lion of God"" could wake? Doctors urge caution. From the archives: Sculpture of Ariel Sharon in coma to go on show in Israel . Sharon was considered one of Israel's finest military commanders of all time and was involved with nearly every major conflict between Israel and its Arab neighbors. From the '70s to the '90s, he encouraged the building of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. He was a top leader in the Likud Party for 15 years and prime minister from 2001 to 2006. ""The two great tragedies in modern Middle Eastern politics, which make you wonder if God wants Middle East peace or not, were (Yitzhak) Rabin's assassination and (Ariel) Sharon's stroke,"" President Bill Clinton remarked in 2011. Sharon has missed seven years of rising and falling tensions in the Mideast, including election victories by Hamas in the West Bank. A revolutionary movement known as the Arab Spring took root in Tunisia in 2010 and spread to Egypt in 2011, toppling decades-old regimes and furthering democratic ideals in the Middle East and North Africa. Sharon brain results not proof he'll wake up . How would Sharon react if he knew that a war in Syria, which is supported in part by Israel's enemy Iran, has been raging for nearly two years? Doctors tested Sharon like this: They would show him pictures of random houses, which he would not be expected to know, and then a picture of his own house. When the images of his own home were shown, areas of his brain ""lit up"" with activity. Doctors then had Sharon's son speak into a device that turned the words into gibberish. Those sounds didn't register in Sharon's brain the same way as when his son actually spoke to him using real words. ""We know that he can process pictures -- pictures of faces,"" said Dr. Alon Friedman of Ben Gurion University. ""And he can even differentiate between pictures of faces and pictures of houses, pictures of his family to other objects. He can differentiate between words that were spoken to him by his son, compared to a noise."" Sharon's brain activity was ""encouraging"" but ""subtle,"" according to a release from Israel's Soroka University Medical Center, which conducted the tests last week. They were administered by a team of U.S. and Israeli scientists. Doctors are still trying to understand precisely what the results indicate. ""But it doesn't mean he's going to sit up tomorrow and start speaking with his family,"" said CNN Senior Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen. ""It just means that things that are familiar to him are just registering in his brain in some way."" Ilan Shelef, head of medical imaging at Soroka University Medical Center said the test ""doesn't mean there is a very high process of interpretation"" in Sharon's brain. ""We are not sure about it,"" Shelef said. ""What we know for sure (is that) there was a significant metabolic response to these stimuli."" When two conscious people are speaking to each other, he explained, their brains are naturally reacting. It's unclear why someone in Sharon's state would respond like that, he said. He cautions against being overly optimistic. ""We know that he is in a very bad situation for many years,"" Shelef said. It's impossible to know whether the test shows that Sharon's condition is improving because, experts say, the test was not performed earlier in Sharon's coma. So there's nothing with which to compare these most recent results. It is ""a comfort,"" he said, to Sharon's family that it seems they've reached him, but they should keep in mind that it's unclear what that means right now. The news about Sharon has reminded the world of his legacy and that it still looms large in Israel. As minister of defense in 1982, he orchestrated Israel's invasion of Lebanon, a military operation that killed hundreds of Lebanese civilians as Israeli forces sought to wipe out Palestine Liberation Organization fighters in the region. His visit in September 2000 to a holy site in Jerusalem -- known to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary and to Jews as the Temple Mount -- set off clashes between Palestinians and Israelis that developed into the Second Intifada, or uprising. Several months later, voters elected him as prime minister by the largest margin of victory in Israeli history. In 2003, he held talks with Palestinian officials about the U.S.-led ""road map to peace"" that called for the eventual creation of a Palestinian state. He broke from the right-wing party Likud in November 2005 to form a centrist political party, Kadima, which means ""forward"" in Hebrew.

"Cambridge, Massachusetts (CNN) -- Millions of Iranians poured into the streets Saturday to celebrate the victory of presidential candidate Hassan Rouhani. Huge crowds snarled traffic in the capital, Tehran, demanding the release of hundreds of political prisoners arrested during protests over sham elections four years ago. ""My dead brother and sister, I got your vote back,"" people chanted, a reference to more than 100 demonstrators killed by the regime. The surprise was not so much that 18 million votes were cast for Rouhani, slightly more than half the ballots, but the fact that the regime had endorsed his victory, triggering hope that international pressure over Iran's nuclear program and growing internal rifts at home might have forced the leadership to restore some of its lost legitimacy. Rouhani is not a reformist, even according to Iranian standards. He had backed the violent crackdown against the pro-democracy student movement in 1999 and never formally aligned himself with the reformist camp. A cleric and a veteran politician since 1979, he was in the circle close to the founder of the revolution, Ayatollah Khomeini. He served five terms as a member of Parliament and 16 years as the head of the National Security Council. During the campaign, he presented himself as a moderate, a platform that appeals to Iran's young electorate, and called for drawing Iran out of its international isolation. ""It is important for the centrifuges to spin, but people's lives should run too,"" he said in a televised address, referring to uranium enrichment. He gained momentum only a few days before the election when two former presidents, both aligned with the reformers, Mohammad Khatami and Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, threw their support behind him. Then voters decided to give the polls, as a window to exercise their democratic rights, another try. Ironically, Rouhani, the only cleric among the eight candidates, favors more political and social freedoms at home. During one of his talks, his supporters chanted slogans demanding the release of opposition leaders, Mehdi Karroubi and Mir Hossein Moussavi, the two presidential candidates in 2009 who have been under house arrest for two years. Opinion: Will Rouhani alter Iran's policy on Syria? The Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, along with his military loyalists, the Revolutionary Guards and its militia wing Basij -- the alliance that many believe stole the election in favor of the incumbent Mahmoud Ahmadinejad -- still remain in ultimate power. Many had suspected that the regime would go to extraordinary lengths, as it did in 2009, to manage the vote from start to finish. The Guards and the Basij campaigned vigorously for Saeed Jalili, a Khamenei loyalist and Iran's hard-line nuclear negotiator. His loss with less than 15% of the vote was an embarrassing rebuke of Khamenei's policies. Last month, demonstrators chanted ""Death to Dictator,"" meaning Khamenei, at the funeral of a dissident cleric in the city of Isfahan. So by giving in to Rouhani's victory, many believe Khamenei is trying fix his tattered image. Rouhani is Iran's next president . Although the election was far from democratic, it provided an opportunity for many Iranians, especially the young, to break the deadly atmosphere of fear the government has imposed for the past four years. The watchdog Guardian Council had already helped Khamenei sideline his rivals, barring a prominent politician and a former president, Rafsanjani, from running in the race. Government forces arrested activists and campaigners in the months before the election. Economic issues were paramount on the minds of voters as U.S.-led sanctions have reduced Iran's oil revenue by half and shot the inflation rate up to more than 30%. Voters recalled Rouhani as the county's pragmatist nuclear envoy who deterred threats in 2003 by signing the Additional Protocol, allowing inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency to visit Iran's nuclear facilities. Further, Iran suspended its sensitive uranium enrichment activities, a process that can be used to make nuclear fuel or a nuclear bomb if uranium is enriched to high levels. Those measures built trust around Iran's nuclear program until Ahmadinejad reversed them in 2005. It is not clear if Khamenei's hard-line allies will allow Rouhani to introduce real change. The president sets the tone for domestic and foreign policy and can make room for more moderate voices in politics. But he holds little power compared with the authority that the constitution gives Khamenei. If Khamenei is willing to end international pressure over Iran's nuclear program, Rouhani provides the perfect opportunity. Rouhani's victory has already bolstered a sense of optimism. Iranian currency, the rial, strengthened slightly against the U.S. dollar for the first time on Saturday after its steady downward spiral since 2011. In his first message after his election, Rouhani declared that ""a new chapter"" has begun and hoped the international community would use a more respectful rhetoric toward Iran. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nazila Fathi.","Nazila Fathi: Half the votes were for Rouhani, but government's support is surprising .
Fathi: He supports enrichment of uranium: ""It is important for the centrifuges to spin""
Rouhani was the only cleric to run, she says, but he favors political and social freedoms .

"(CNN) -- What a difference 24 hours makes. Jack Trammell unanimously won the Democratic nomination for Virginia's 7th Congressional District seat at the party convention last weekend. That's because no one else wanted to run against Rep. Eric Cantor, the second most powerful Republican in the House. But after Cantor's shocking defeat in his primary Tuesday against political novice Dave Brat, Trammell's candidacy has a whole new meaning. Democrats have a bit more hope in this Republican district, now that the upstart Democrat is up against an upstart Republican -- both of whom are professors at the same college. ""Now it's going to be a grass-roots race to get out their base,"" Ashley Bauman, press secretary for the Virginia Democratic Party, said. Trammell is not your average politician. He works a small family farm, where he lives with his wife and seven children. He teaches disability studies and is director of Disability Support Services at Randolph-Macon College, a small liberal arts school outside Richmond that has just over 1,000 students. He is a prolific writer, author of more than 20 books, both fact and fiction, including a children's book. His latest tome is about the Virginia slave trade and he is currently writing a novel about vampires. A Civil War buff, he has also written dozens of columns on the Civil War for the Washington Times. While his bio says he worked for Bill Clinton's presidential campaigns in Kentucky, he is a political amateur. His online political presence is minimal. His Twitter account is brand new and has two tweets. His campaign Facebook page was built Monday, after he won the Democratic nomination. On the page he received advice from supporters, suggesting he build a campaign website and include a ""donate now"" button. Others suggested he lose his facial hair. By the morning after Cantor's defeat, Trammell heeded the advice of his supporters. He was able to put up a campaign website, which is still sparsely populated and only includes a three-paragraph bio, an e-mail signup to get involved, and that essential button for contributions. The Democratic Party is shielding Trammell from the press for now, intercepting his media requests and offering surrogates instead. The academic has a lot to learn and not a lot of time. But his statement after the Republican primary results indicates he's a fast learner, as it echoed the message of national Democrats. ""I am running because I believe Virginians are hungry for a radical change from the dysfunctional and reckless politics being practiced by those in Congress -- and the results of tonight's primary election are the proof,"" he said in a statement after Brat's insurgent victory. The 7th District is very conservative, with the Cook Political Report maintaining its political rating as solid Republican. But with two political novice college professors running against each other, anything could be possible. With Brat's victory, the impossible has already happened once in this district. Eric Cantor loses primary in big upset; Lindsey Graham avoids runoff . Cantor 'earthquake' rattles Capitol Hill . Opinion: Who said the tea party was dead?","Jack Trammell is the Democratic challenger in Virginia's 7th District .

"(CNN) -- Did a ""U.S. special force"" commit acts of ""torture"" and ""murder"" in Afghanistan? That suggestion came out of a meeting of the ruling Afghan council led by President Hamid Karzai. NATO said Monday it has found no evidence to support the allegations, which appeared in a statement Sunday from Karzai's office. ""It became clear that armed individuals named as U.S. special force stationed in Wardak province engage in harassing, annoying, torturing and even murdering innocent people,"" said the statement. It didn't indicate who identified the attackers as ""U.S. special force."" Nine people ""disappeared in an operation"" recently by a ""suspicious force"" in Wardak province, west of Kabul, according to the statement from Karzai's office. Wardak is important because it's often used as a main route for insurgents trying to gain access to Kabul. The statement also described an incident in which a student was taken from his home at night. His ""tortured body with throat cut was found two days later under a bridge,"" the statement said. ""Such actions have caused local public resentment and hatred,"" said Karzai's office. The shocking allegations follow months of U.S. Special Operations raids that have deeply offended some Afghans angry about foreigners entering their homes. U.S. officials have said the raids are vital to NATO's operation against insurgents. The U.S. military has said it is investigating and officials of NATO's International Security Assistance Force plan to hold talks about the allegations with Afghan officials. A joint investigation will be conducted by a commission made up of U.S., NATO and Afghan officials, ISAF spokesman Jamie Graybeal told CNN. ""We have spent the day in discussions with the Afghan government and agreed to a joint commission that will look into the concerns of the people of Wardak,"" he said. ISAF said Monday via Twitter, ""We will not start with the assumption that the allegations are true. We looked into the allegations"" and ""found no supporting evidence for them."" Local officials told CNN the allegations came from residents in Wardak. Hazrat Janan, a member of the local provincial council, told CNN that dozens of people complained to him and a visiting delegation from Kabul about alleged attacks on civilians by ""U.S. special forces."" The delegation then reported it to Karzai, Janan said. NATO's response came a day after the Afghan government demanded that U.S. Special Operations Forces leave Wardak province. The Afghanistan National Security Council also said the ISAF must stop all special forces operations in the province. ""Until we have a chance to speak with Afghan officials, we can't comment further on the statements of yesterday,"" ISAF said Monday. Janan told CNN that until recently, there had always been good coordination between the Americans and the Afghans. ""But in the last several months this coordination had vanished and caused so many tensions including all these civilian causalities and complaints against them,"" Janan said. Wardak provincial spokesman Ataullah Khugyani told CNN there have been ""too many complaints against U.S. special forces in different districts of the province."" Another local official told CNN Karzai's order for U.S. Special Operations Forces to leave the province may have helped to avoid more trouble. ""If President Karzai's hadn't made the decision, the people of the province were planning big riots and they wanted to block the Kabul-Bamyan and Kabul-Kandahar highways,"" said Esmat Hotak,a resident of Wardak's Jalriz district. ""Just a month ago U.S. special forces blew up the gates of 12 houses in a single night and beat up 20 young men in Zewalat area of the province."" However, some Afghans fear a Taliban resurgence if there are no U.S. special forces in the region. ""In the last year U.S. special forces destroyed almost 70% of the Taliban and other insurgents in Wardak province without causing any civilian casualties,"" said an Afghan political analyst in Wardak who asked not to be identified, fearing retribution. ""If the U.S. special forces leave the province, I am sure that the province would completely fall into the hands of the insurgents in less than a year and that would definitely have a negative impact on the security in Kabul and other neighboring provinces."" Last April, the United States and Afghanistan signed a deal that effectively gave Afghan authorities veto power over controversial special forces missions. The agreement prevents ISAF from conducting such operations without the explicit permission of Afghan officials, a senior NATO official said. Special Operations Forces will operate under Afghan law, said a statement from Karzai's office. The complex system fully ""Afghanized"" such operations, putting Afghan commandos in the lead and giving American Special Operations Forces a ""training and support role,"" a senior Afghan official said. Under the deal, U.S. Special Operations Forces would be on the ground but would not enter Afghan homes unless specifically asked to do so by Afghan commandos leading the operation, or by other Afghan officials, a senior NATO official said. CNN's Masoud Popalzai reported this story from Afghanistan, CNN's Barbara Starr reported from the Pentagon, CNN's Thom Patterson, Catherine E. Shoichet and Greg Botelho reported from Atlanta and Nick Paton Walsh contributed to this report.","NEW: A U.S.-NATO-Afghan joint probe will look at allegations against U.S. ""special force""

"(CNN) -- Reddit general manager Erik Martin has had a busy few days. His popular website, which thrives on real-time message boards and contributions by users on a variety of topics, received record traffic -- as well as pointed criticism -- for its treatment of the Boston Marathon bomber case. In particular, critics took Reddit to task for what they perceived as its overeager determination to help authorities identify suspects in the many images of the scene being shared online. One group of redditors, as the site's users are known, speculated that Sunil Tripathi, a Brown University student who has been missing since last month, could be a possible suspect. Tripathi's family temporarily took down a Facebook page asking for help finding him after they were bombarded by ugly comments. Other Reddit users focused on two young men with heavy-looking bags, one of whom wore a blue track suit. The New York Post even splashed a photo of the two marathon spectators on its front page with the headline, ""Bag Men: Feds seek these two pictured at Boston Marathon."" The guy in the track suit turned out to be a 17-year-old suburban Boston track star who told The Associated Press he was afraid to leave his house because of the scrutiny. Reaction was quick and scathing. The Atlantic's Alexis Madrigal wrote a column called ""Hey Reddit, Enough Boston Bombing Vigilantism,"" and followed it up with a story on how the names of two innocent people got repeated in a viral loop on social media. Alex Pareene addressed the issue in a similar Salon column, ""The Internet's shameful false ID."" The moderator of a subreddit, or comment thread titled findbostonbombers, which had been set up to crowdsource the identities of the bombers, apologized. Martin agrees with some of the criticism. ""The crowdsourced, more criminal investigation was very volatile and fraught with problems, and, obviously, wrong,"" he told CNN in an interview Monday. ""That was something we all wished hadn't happened."" He posted a note on the site that went into more detail. ""We hoped that the crowdsourced search for new information would not spark exactly this type of witch hunt. We were wrong,"" it read. Noting the site's rule against widely sharing personal information, it added, ""The search for the bombers bore less resemblance to the types of vindictive internet witch hunts our no-personal-information rule was originally written for, but the outcome was no different."" Canvassing the Internet . But, Martin adds, Reddit did a lot of good as well. Another subreddit, devoted to aggregating the news as it happened, is only the second thread in the site's history -- after President Obama's ""Ask Me Anything"" page -- to outpace Reddit's mainpage in traffic. The site overall peaked at 270,000 visitors -- 50% higher than its usual -- when bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was captured Friday night. Reddit's ability to stay current is one of the site's great advantages, writes Time's Jared Newman. ""As a massive community on the hunt for interesting things, it can canvas the Internet in ways that a single news organization or reporter cannot,"" he wrote. Redditors also used Boston-area threads to let visitors know what streets were passable and closed, worked to get pizzas to hospitals and emergency workers, helped find hotel rooms for stranded visitors and even arranged a meetup at a park for playing with dogs. That's the thing about crowdsourcing and social media, says cybersecurity expert Doug White: The media are only as good as their contributors. In general, getting more people involved can be beneficial to law enforcement, says White, the head of the Forensic, Applied Networking & Security Lab at Rhode Island's Roger Williams University. ""Initially, it helps,"" he says. ""My experience is that, with any piece of evidence, the more people who look at it, the more likely you are to get a different viewpoint. The more eyes that see it, the better off you are."" A new protocol? On the other hand, Internet participation is so new that law enforcement isn't sure how to handle it, he says. It's like the old-fashioned police-tip lines, except on a much bigger scale. (After the FBI released photos of the bombing suspects, its website received more than 300,000 tips per minute, according to news reports.) Like eliminating bugs from software programs, it takes time to weed the cranks out of the system -- and, in a fast-moving case like Boston, the cranks went viral, as all the false IDs and dead ends indicated. ""I think there's a lot of issues with doing this, but I hope these people have a protocol,"" White says. Oscar Baez, a 24-year south Florida law enforcement veteran, agrees that participants on sites such as Reddit should funnel their theories and suggestions to authorities. ""On the computer, you can do whatever you want to, as long as you don't interfere with somebody's rights,"" says Baez, who now heads a private firm called Executive Tactical Training. ""I always say, give us the information, let us do the legwork, let us do the computer work, let us do everything."" It's not just for reasons of privacy and proper legal protocol, he adds. People can get hurt. Baez has had tipsters call who tell him they've been conducting surveillance on suspects, which makes him furious. ""What if they're following the real suspect? What if they're following a murderer? Once that person realizes there's somebody following them, the chances are pretty good they're going to get hurt,"" he says. And hiding behind a computer is no promise of safety, he adds: ""Even contacting that person online can still be traced back to you."" Media mixups . As with past episodes -- such as the naming of the wrong suspect in the Newtown massacre -- the frantic pursuit of information can come perilously close to mob justice. The subreddit board, interestingly, was aware of how things could go wrong. Throughout last week's chain of events, two of the most popular entries were dedicated to Richard Jewell, the man falsely accused of the Atlanta Centennial Olympic Park bombing, and a link to an Errol Morris video on ""Umbrella Man,"" a figure who has been wrongly named in a number of JFK conspiracy theories. Both functioned as warnings for what could happen when gut reaction overwhelmed calm rationality. Oops777, the redditor who set up findbostonbombers in the first place, kept trying to rein in both Reddit users and the news media. ""Media Outlets, please stop making the images of potential suspects go viral, then blaming this small subreddit for it,"" he titled one post. ""Until the media got involved, none of the images were going anywhere but to the FBI."" But maintaining control is always going to be a challenge on such free-flowing sites, says Reddit's Martin. ""I don't think we can fix the basic problems with human behavior,"" he says. But, he adds, ""We can certainly mitigate it. If we can make sure to channel people's desire to help and adrenaline-fueled activity into things that are clearly positive and aren't fraught with as many dangerous (possibilities), that should be the aim for any future crisis.""","Reddit received some criticism for its handling of the Boston Marathon bomber case .

"Washington (CNN) -- A top U.S. diplomat will travel to three nations around North Korea early next year in the first such talks since longtime leader Kim Jong Il's death, the State Department announced Thursday. Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Kurt Campbell will ""discuss a range of important bilateral, regional and global issues"" during his four days in China, South Korea and Japan, the State Department said. The statement specifically mentions that the ""latest developments related to North Korea,"" as well as Myanmar, will be on the agenda. Myanmar, also known as Burma, has seen rapid political change -- including the legalization of famed dissident Aung Sang Suu Kyi's political party -- since the election of a new president in March. The announcement about Campbell's trip came the same day that U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta talked by phone with his South Korean counterpart, Kim Kwan-Jin. During the roughly 20-minute call, the pair discussed the situation in the Korean peninsula and stressed that maintaining peace and security were their top priorities, Pentagon spokesman George Little said. This all comes on the heels of the death of communist North Korea's leader on December 17. Huge crowds gathered Thursday in Pyongyang for a state-orchestrated memorial service a day after his funeral. During that ceremony, Kim Yong Nam -- the president of North Korea's parliament -- declared that Kim Jong Un ""is the supreme leader who has inherited (his father's) beliefs, leadership, courage and guts."" Campbell's trip begins Tuesday in Beijing. The U.S. diplomat then will head to the South Korean capital of Seoul for the following two days, before wrapping up January 7 in Tokyo. Under Kim Jong Il, North Korea suffered a devastating famine, even as it built up its million-strong army, expanded its arsenal of ballistic missiles and became the world's eighth declared nuclear power. Pyongyang's policies and rhetoric often put it at odds with the United States and its ally, South Korea. Washington does not have formal diplomatic relations with Pyongyang, though it has had communications with the reclusive nation, such as through the so-called six-party talks. In October, U.S. officials held a ""positive"" meeting with a North Korean delegation in an effort to restart these long-stalled discussions over ending Pyongyang's nuclear program, U.S. Ambassador Stephen Bosworth said at the time. North Korea technically remains at war with the South more than five decades after their 1950-1953 conflict, after which an armistice was signed between the two nations. There was never a formal peace treaty. That uncertainty has left the peninsula split by the world's most heavily fortified border. Adding to the insecurity are questions about Kim Jong Un, who remains largely an unknown quantity outside his own country. A delegation of 18 South Korean citizens returned Tuesday from a two-day visit to the north to pay their respects to the fallen leader and meet with his successor, Kim. Seoul has expressed its sympathy to the North Korean people and gave the green light for the visit by the civilian group -- which includes Hyundai Group Chairwoman Hyun Jeong-Eun and the widow of former South Korean President Kim Dae-jung. A day earlier, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda met with Chinese President Hu Jintao in Beijing. ""The two sides believe that maintaining peace and stability of the Korean peninsula serves the common interests of all parties,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei told reporters Monday after the two leaders' meeting.","NEW: The U.S. and South Korean defense ministers talk by phone, a spokesman says .

"Washington (CNN) -- Bill Clinton has never had a problem getting into the muck of politics. Since leaving the White House in 2001 and stepping into the role of the Democrats' elder statesman, the former President has continually shown why he rose from humble roots in rural Arkansas to president of the United States in the first place: his political chops and willingness to use them. So when Karl Rove, the uber-Republican strategist, floated questions about Hillary Clinton's health, it was no surprise that Bill Clinton was the one to respond from ""Clintonland,"" not Hillary. ""I've got to give him credit,"" Clinton said of Rove on Wednesday at an event in Washington. ""That embodies that old saying that consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds. First they said she faked her concussion. And now they say she's auditioning for a part on 'The Walking Dead.'"" Bill Clinton went on to say he was ""sort of dumbfounded"" by the fact that Rove reportedly hinted last week that Hillary Clinton may have suffered a ""traumatic brain injury"" when she fell and suffered a concussion in December 2012. As a result of the fall, she suffered a blood clot in a vein between her skull and brain and was treated at a New York City hospital for three days. Bill Clinton said he had no questions about his wife's health. ""Look, she works out every week, she is strong, she's doing great. As far as I can tell she's in better shape than I am. She certainly seems to have more stamina now,"" he said. ""I don't know but if it is you can't be too upset about it. It is just the beginning. They'll get better at it. I am still waiting for them to admit there was nothing to Whitewater."" Fear factor: Rove comments show GOP's concerns about Clinton . Clinton's response was mild, but there were undertones that there was more where that came from. According to one of the former President's advisers, he considered Rove's comments a weak attack. ""So stupid as to be a low hanging curve ball,"" the adviser told CNN's Jake Tapper. Gingrich slams 'Republican consultant class' Notably, however, Hillary Clinton -- who has tried to remain above politics while she weighs a possible White House run -- remained mum about the kerfuffle. At two events in Washington on Wednesday -- one to a prominent Jewish group and another at the World Bank -- the former first lady didn't come close to addressing the Rove questions and instead left the job of responder-in-chief to her husband. The role is a familiar one for Bill Clinton. ""I think he says whatever he wants whenever he wants to,"" Richard Socarides, a former Clinton White House adviser, told CNN's ""New Day"" on Thursday. ""I think it is natural."" Since his wife agreed to become America's top diplomat in early 2009 and now that she is weighing a run at the presidency, Bill Clinton has rarely shied away from getting into the political fray. He endorsed candidates who helped with his wife's 2008 presidential run and looked to bury those who crossed the Clintons during that failed campaign. Bill Clinton's role is put into full perspective in ""HRC: State Secrets and the Rebirth of Hillary Clinton,"" a book by Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes that details Hillary Clinton's time at the State Department. According to the authors, Jason Altmire, a former congressman from Pennsylvania, was the epitome of Bill Clinton's political retribution. Bill Clinton defends Hillary Clinton over Benghazi . ""If there was a poster boy for the betrayal-and-revenge narrative, it was Altmire, a tall, broad-shouldered former Florida State University football player who had won his western Pennsylvania House seat in the midterm Democratic landslide of 2006,"" the authors wrote, before describing the lengths the Clintons went to in the run up to the 2008 election to win over the congressman. When Altmire decided not to endorse anyone, the congressman was blacklisted and earned Bill Clinton's ire. ""The bill for Altmire's neutrality would come due nearly four years later, to the day, in the 2012 Pennsylvania Democratic primary,"" write Parnes and Allen, when the former President choose to endorse Mark Critz over Altmire. When Critz went on to win the primary, his victory was largely attributed to two things: His strong labor support and the endorsement he picked up from Bill Clinton. Although Altmire's anecdote is a colorful example, the story is not totally unique. On Wednesday, for example, the former President endorsed Maryland gubernatorial hopeful Anthony Brown over his top challenger, Maryland Attorney General Douglas Gansler. Bill Clinton touted Brown's record and notes that he felt ""enormous affection"" for him. Not surprisingly, Brown was a vocal supporter of Hillary Clinton's failed 2008 bid and traveled to a number of states on the campaign's behalf. Gansler, on the other hand, was a proud supporter of Barack Obama and co-chaired his 2008 primary campaign in Maryland. Bill Clinton's support was so potent that when the Brown campaign announced it in April, Gansler felt it necessary to issue a statement that spelled out his ""respect"" for the former President and his strong support for Hillary Clinton, ""should she choose to run"" in 2016. Whether Hillary Clinton will run is not the only question facing the Clintons right now, though. In order for her to be successful, a number of Democratic strategists have said, Bill Clinton's role will also have to be defined. In 2008, Clinton was a staple of the campaign trail and while he was a prolific fundraiser and campaigner, he also had a few notable blowups as things went sour. Republicans -- some of whom would probably like to see less of Bill Clinton -- suggest that he would be a political liability for a Clinton campaign. ""Hillary Clinton cannot hide behind her husband on this. It was an interesting decision, if it was one, to have him come out and say anything,"" said Cheri Jacobus, a Republican strategist, about Bill Clinton's response to Rove.

"(CNN) -- The jarring sounds of war have longed echoed over Mogadishu. Now it's time for music to rock the Somali capital. Armed with powerful songs and bold lyrics, a daring group of hip-hop musicians has defied death threats and violent attacks from militant extremists to spread its message of peace in war-torn Mogadishu. Waayaha Cusub, a popular collective of Somali refugee musicians based in Kenya, traveled to the coastal city to stage the Mogadishu Music Festival, expected to be the country's biggest music event since the eruption of a vicious civil war in 1991. ""Through this tour and our music we are trying to pass the Somali people a message to stop the killing, to stop the dying, because, there is no need for all these people dying for nothing,"" says Shiine Akhyaar Ali, lead singer and manager of Waayaha Cusub, a group famous for its lyrics attacking Somali warlords. ""We want to finish this war for good."" 'We will continue' Waayaha Cusub, whose name translates as ""new era,"" was formed in 2004, featuring the talents of a revolving collective of exiled rappers and singers who moved to neighboring Kenya to escape the horrors of Somalia's conflict. Led by Ali and fellow singer Falis Abdi, who are now married, the group's energetic rap and soulful R&B struck a chord with the youth in East Africa. From their makeshift studio in Nairobi, they first tasted success with songs touching on themes such as love, poverty and human rights. Yet as the crisis in their homeland deepened, Waayaha Cusub's lyrics soon broke into more dangerous territory. ""Shocked shocked/Who is behind this trail of destruction?/Al-Shabaab is/They galvanize people on the street for their wicked cause/They profess to be pious but they wield machetes,"" raps Ali in Somali on ""Yaabka al Shabaab"" (Reject the Extremists), one of the group's most popular songs. Al-Shabaab was once the armed wing of the Islamic Courts Union, which took over most of southern Somalia in the second half of 2006. As it expanded its reach in the East African country, the al Qaeda-linked insurgent group started implementing cruel punishments for behavior it deemed un-Islamic: women were stoned to death for adultery, amputations and beheadings became common, while in some areas Al-Shabaab banned listening to the radio. Read this: Somali women defy danger to write history . Popular musicians were also a target; Waayaha Cusub, which had caused a stir by having women dance on stage and in its videos, received several threats and was ordered to stop making music. ""They sent us a lot of threatening messages and also phone calls,"" recalls Ali, who is from the town of Dhusamareeb. ""They were saying, 'you are doing propaganda for anti-Islam or anti-jihad, so we will finish you,'"" he adds. And that's what they tried to do. In late 2007, militants broke into Ali's Nairobi house and shot him several times. The rapper, who managed to escape, took five bullets and suffered internal organ injuries, as well as an arm wound. Since then, several more incidents have followed, with radical militants threatening members of the band and in some cases assaulting them. Yet all these attacks have failed to deter Waayaha Cusub. Its members have continued risking their lives, remaining on the front line to promote their message for peace. ""If we stop, I think these people will win, they will reach their aim,"" says Ali. ""So if we continue, we are the winners because we need to tell our people that terrorism is not good, that killing people is not good, that suicide bombing is not good. So we will continue."" 'Blow their minds with hop-hop' Somalia moved a step closer to stability last September after picking its first president elected on home soil in decades. Following months of ironing out planning details and security arrangements, Waayaha Cusub is now set to put on an array of free concerts and other related artistic activities in Mogadishu, with the support of local and international officials. Read this: 'New hope for Somalia' Joining them, fellow Somali musicians and performers from the United States, Afghanistan, Kenya and other countries will unite their voices in a crescendo of ""stealth events"" that will pop up around Mogadishu over the next few days. Organizers say these events are designed to rally would-be fighters to peacefully resist extremism. Music workshops and open mic events with at-risk youth and former militia will kick-start the proceedings, followed by a solidarity show featuring international musicians such as Afghani-American folk singer Ariana Delawari, Filipino reggae fusion artist Jahm-Eye and Sudanese soul singer Alsarah. The event will culminate in the main Somali Reconciliation Concert, headlined by Waayaha Cusub and featuring cameo appearances by other Somali and international performers. ""It's always been Waayaha Cusub's way to respond to violence in the community by pulling youth away from the fray and into a venue where they give them an open mic to share their feelings, and then blow their minds with Somali hip-hop about ending the war,"" says Daniel J Gerstle, the festival's lead producer and founder of Humanitarian Bazaar, a group organizing music events promoting peace. ""Countering the terror groups and extremist rebels who use surprise bombings to destroy, these singers launch surprise flash mob concerts to bring back the message of love and peace,"" he adds. For security reasons, each event will be held at a different venue, organizers say. The exact locations and times will only be revealed shortly before each event by phone or text message. Even though insurgents have fled Mogadishu and guns have largely fallen silent, security is still a risk -- at least 10 people were killed in the suicide bombing of a bus outside Mogadishu's National Theater on March 18. Portions of Somalia still remain lawless as large parts of the country are under the control of militants, such as Al-Shabaab. 'Somali Sunrise' The festival in Mogadishu is the latest event in Waayaha Cusub's tour aiming to win over youth and convince them to turn away from violence. Starting with concerts in the United States last summer, Waayaha Cusub then brought its Somali Sunrise Concert Tour back to East Africa. True to their intrepid reputation and message of peace, the rappers staged a string of ""stop-the-violence"" surprise shows in one of Nairobi's toughest neighborhoods in November 2012 in response to a chain of blasts that had rocked the Kenyan capital. The group's performances will be featured in ""Live from Mogadishu,"" a documentary following the band's death-defying journey to bring modern live music back to their homeland. ""I have worked and supported musicians also in Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq -- really, this group, they're the most willing to risk their lives and really go straight against the extremism,"" says Gerstle, who is also behind the documentary, set to be released later this year. ""A lot of music and human rights projects around the world are just about being happy and love and stuff like that, but this one is much more specifically trying to persuade youth to make a better choice,"" he adds. ""They are risking their lives and being much more on the front line than any of the other musicians."" For Ali, the time is now right to take his music back to Somalia. ""At this time, we need to start to reach the youth in Somalia to pass our message,"" he says. ""We need to tell them that this jihad is not good, is not right, so this time I think in Somalia most people don't want the extreme ideas. I think this time it's better than before.""","The Somali capital of Mogadishu is set to host its biggest music festival in over two decades .

"Nova Friburgo, Brazil (CNN) -- The death toll from devastating flooding in Brazil continued to rise Sunday, surpassing 600, the government said. At least 655 deaths were reported in a mountainous region of Rio de Janeiro state, northeast of the city of Rio. Other states in the South American country have also seen heavy rainfall. Last week, authorities in neighboring Sao Paulo state said 24 people had been killed by flooding. Forecasters there said late Sunday that an approaching cold front could bring more flooding and landslides. Most of the deaths in Rio de Janeiro state were reported in the cities of Nova Friburgo and Teresopolis, with 302 and 276 fatalities, respectively. The state's health and civil defense department reported 58 fatalities in the town of Petropolis and 19 in Sumidouro. Officials in that office also warned residents of the risk of waterborne diseases. Several thousand vaccines against tetanus and diphtheria have been distributed, they said. Rescuers have not been able to reach some hard-hit areas, and many more people are feared dead. The rain is predicted to continue for several days in areas already submerged in water or slathered with mud. Members of the army entered parts of Teresopolis and were able to rescue 110 families. Thousands of families are still living on mountain slopes or on riverbanks and face extreme risk of being washed away. One resident described the disaster as a tsunami that fell from the sky. In a statement, Rio Gov. Sergio Cabral said he had a panic attack when he was traveling to Nova Friburgo and saw a devastated mountainside. Outside a makeshift morgue in Teresopolis, a crowd of people waited for their turn to identify loved ones. Marco Antonio Siqueira Costa said the last time he saw his brother, sister-in-law and niece was a few days ago, before mud buried their house. ""I think that last meeting was God's way of granting us a farewell,"" he said. Residents in the city donned masks and helped clean streets or deliver first aid. Others combed the city searching desperately for missing loved ones. Red Cross volunteer Maria Helena de Jesus was helping with first aid. ""You have to almost have a heart of stone,"" she said. ""It was very difficult."" Teresopolis Mayor Jorge Mario Sedlacek declared his city a natural disaster area. President Dilma Rousseff flew over flood-affected areas last week and landed in Friburgo, the agency said. The floods are her first test as president. She trudged through mud to talk to residents in a neighborhood where four of seven firefighters trying to rescue people had been buried under mud. The other three were pulled out alive. ""We are going to take firm action"" to help the devastated areas, Rousseff said. Brazilian authorities have been criticized for a lack of disaster planning, and for and allowing people to build homes in areas known to become treacherous in the rainy season. They are under increasing pressure to show a strong response. Brazil is scheduled to host the World Cup in 2014 and the Olympics in 2016. Journalist Fabiana Frayssinet contributed to this report.","Forecasters say more flooding and landslides could hit Sao Paulo state .

"Beijing (CNN) -- U.S. Vice President Joe Biden arrived in Beijing Wednesday to kick off a five-day visit to China. Biden comes at the invitation of Vice President Xi Jinping as part of planned reciprocal visits by the two nations' vice presidents, according to a White House statement. Biden is expected to hold extensive talks with Xi. ""One of the primary purposes of the trip is to get to know China's future leadership, to build a relationship with Vice President Xi, and to discuss with him and other Chinese leaders the full breadth of issues in the U.S.-China relationship,"" said Tony Blinken, national security adviser to the vice president. ""Simply put, we're investing in the future of the U.S.-China relationship."" Political analysts say Biden's trip is an opportunity for American officials to know Xi, who is considered a likely successor to President Hu Jintao. Says Kenneth Lieberthal, senior fellow at Brookings Institution in Washington: ""Biden needs to have some serious relationship with and understanding of Xi Jinping, who is very likely to be the next head of the party, the military and president of the government of China. I think Biden is looking forward to spending literally hours with Xi and then to host him back in the U.S., just to begin to see and understand about the way he thinks, what his priorities are, what he is passionate about."" In Beijing, Biden will also meet with President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao. On Friday, he will travel to Chengdu, the capital city of Sichuan province, accompanied by Vice President Xi. He will give speech at Sichuan University and visit Dujiangyan, an ancient dam, and a high school rebuilt after the devastating earthquake in 2008. Biden is also expected to have an informal dinner in a local restaurant with Xi, an unusual arrangement by Chinese protocol's standards in receiving top foreign officials. This is Biden's third trip to China since 1979, when he came with the first Senate delegation to visit the country after the normalization of diplomatic relations. Biden's talks in Beijing are expected to focus on the debt crisis in the United States. As the biggest overseas holder of U.S. treasury bills, China seeks Washington's reassurance that the U.S. debts are secure. Says Lieberthal: ""There are many in China who are very critical of their own government for investing as heavily as they have in U.S. treasuries. There is a genuine concern in China about how the U.S. economy will function, how the U.S. dollar will do, how strong U.S. import demand is likely to be. They'd be extremely interested to hear his views on what is likely to happen in the U.S. and our economy."" Danny Russell, senior director for Asian affairs at National Security Staff, said Biden and his Chinese interlocutors are expected to tackle a range of security and economic issues, including North Korea and Iran's nuclear weapons programs and security issues in East Asia. ""Naturally, there are issues that the Chinese themselves typically raise like Taiwan and Tibet. And there are issues that every senior official who meets with Chinese leaders is going to raise, like human rights,"" Russell said. Lieberthal said Biden will also be keen to learn more about what is going on with China's economy. ""All the press has been focused on the U.S. economy, but the Chinese economy has its own very serious challenges,"" he said. ""The vice president will wish to get a feel for, if you will, the political economy of China, how politics and the economy inter-act and therefore what to expect in China, because how China fares has direct impact on those concerned with the U.S. economy.""","The visit is part of a reciprocal agreement for the vice presidents to meet .

"(CNN) -- It's called ""Apple picking,"" a growing wave of crime in which thieves target mobile devices, particularly iPhones and iPads. Now the company that gave the crime its name is taking a step to stop it, with a ""kill switch""-style update aimed at making the mobile gadgets less valuable to thieves. Activation Lock will be part of iOS 7, the latest version of Apple's mobile operating system expected to roll out in the fall. The feature will require an Apple ID and password before the phone's ""Find My iPhone"" feature can be turned off or any data can be erased. At a keynote address opening its annual Worldwide Developers Conference, the company said the same ID and password will be needed to reactivate a device after it's been remotely erased. ""We think this is going to be a really powerful theft deterrent,"" said Craig Federighi, a senior vice president at Apple. As mobile devices become more popular, stealing them has become a unique sort of crime that has law enforcement and government officials taking notice. In New York, a special police unit has been created to deal with stolen mobile devices. The overall crime rate in the city increased 3% last year -- but ""if you subtracted just the increase in Apple product thefts, we would have had an overall decrease in crime in New York,"" Deputy Police Commissioner Paul Browne said. Advocates have been calling for so-called kill switch tools in all mobile devices for some time. Apple's announcement came the same week that George Gascon, the district attorney in tech hub San Francisco, plans to meet with the New York state attorney general and representatives of cell phone companies to discuss ways of discouraging mobile-device robberies. In a letter last year to the Federal Communications Commission chairman, the wireless industry's trade association released details of a voluntary effort to ""help law enforcement deter smartphone theft."" A major plank of that effort is the creation of a database for smartphones reported stolen. Phones on the database, which is scheduled to be up and running at the end of November, could not be activated and would not work on an LTE network in the United States.","New iPhone ""kill switch"" targets crime known as ""Apple picking""

"(CNN) -- Why do UFOs always land in the USA, wondered someone in ""Monsters vs. Aliens""? Good question. Sharlto Copley plays a bureaucrat forced into action in ""District 9,"" a film about extraterrestrials. But it's not always the case, as Neill Blomkamp's adventurous sci-fi movie, ""District 9,"" goes to show. Presented in the now-familiar fake-doc style -- at least until Blomkamp gets bored with its limitations when the action heats up -- ""District 9"" is an edgy little B movie with an injection of impressive big-money special effects courtesy of ""Lord of the Rings"" director-producer Peter Jackson. The story's origins are with the extraterrestrials' arrival in the early '80s, when they park their spaceship a mile or so above Johannesburg, South Africa. The ship is vast -- almost the size of the city -- but when after three months there has been no contact from the visitors, no sign of life in any form, the authorities decide to break in. What they find is a wretched cargo of pale, starving creatures: tall bipeds with scaly skin and stubby insect-like tentacles around the mouth. The humans call them ""prawns,"" and after establishing that the worst threat they pose is a cosmic PR disaster, they bring them down to earth and stick them in a refugee camp. That would be District 9, a shantytown of makeshift wooden shacks, no electricity or running water, and scarcely enough space for the million or so newcomers. After a couple of decades of uneasy coexistence, even this set-up seems too cozy for the residents of Jo'burg. With civil strife and black-market gangsters getting out hand, it is decided the prawns should be relocated to a new camp, somewhere out of harm's way. International law being what it is, the South Africans are required to collect the signatures to indicate the prawns' acquiescence. And that's where mild-mannered bureaucrat Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley) comes in -- with a delegation of trigger-happy private security guards. ""District 9"" is a truly global affair. The South African-born Blomkamp learned his trade in Canada, and found a mentor in New Zealand. But it's the location that allows this allegory to resonate. Here in North America we may darkly imagine that interlopers not only mean us harm but that they have the wherewithal to back it up. In South Africa, though, the story takes on more complex, queasy echoes. The British effectively invented concentration camps here at the turn of the 19th century, and the Boers, the victims then, would mandate that native Africans were nothing but second-class citizens. Naturally the prawns come lower still down the pecking order. Blomkamp indulges in grisly, blackly comic satire worthy of Paul ""Starship Troopers"" Verhoeven as our man Wikus (Sharito Copley) casually demonstrates the art of aborting alien offspring with the aid of a flamethrower, all for the edification of the viewers back home. Complacent and overconfident in front of the cameras, Wikus gets his comeuppance when he accidentally ingests an unidentified liquid substance, which incurs an alarming physical reaction. At this point, the movie changes tone, sometimes for better, sometimes not. ""District 9"" also begs plenty of questions; not much of it makes sense if you stop to think about it. And Blomkamp seriously overplays his hand in the long, thoroughly conventional climactic shoot-'em-up. What should have been a taut 90-minute nightmare flick -- a classic midnight movie -- has somehow pumped up into a 112-minute approximation of a Hollywood action blockbuster. Still, ""District 9"" has plenty of material to chew on. Expanded from a six-minute short, it's a brashly confident debut, full of sharp, inventive detail (the prawns are crazy for cat food) and rooted in a couple of Big Ideas. Well worth the time, if not all of it. ""District 9"" runs 112 minutes and is rated R. For Entertainment Weekly's review, click here.","""District 9"" is a winning debut, says CNN.com's Tom Charity .

"Vicksburg, Mississippi (CNN) -- Storms were forecast Saturday for areas already suffering from the swollen Mississippi River, as Mississippi's governor urged caution. The rain comes as the Mississippi River was cresting in Natchez, Mississippi. The water was cresting at 61.8 feet, or 13.8 feet above flood stage there, according to the National Weather Service. There were some early signs of recovery farther north in Vicksburg, where the river had already crested, though the floodwaters are expected to remain for weeks. The Yazoo backwater levee near Vicksburg had hit its peak, CNN affiliate WLBT reported. ""These levees are going to be more and more saturated every day. There will be continuing wave action up against them and so people shouldn't drop their guard,"" Gov. Haley Barbour told reporters in Yazoo City Friday. Although many displaced residents in Vicksburg are eager to return to their homes, until the water level recedes, only emergency officials will be allowed, WLBT reported. ""It is illegal to drive a boat in flooded areas and it will remain so until that executive order is lifted, which won't be soon,"" Barbour said. The governor also warned of health risks to both the emergency responders and residents. ""We've had reports of water samples where the E. coli level was 200 times normal. This stuff is nasty,"" Barbour said. The governor himself owns a lake home that has been flooded. The Mississippi River is not expected to return to its 43-foot flood stage in Vicksburg until after June 14, which is 46 days after it climbed out of its banks, said Amanda Roberts, a National Weather Service hydrologist. It crested at 57.1 feet Thursday. The river is more than a foot over the record set in the city in 1927. ""We're in need of, first off, a place to live. And then second off, pretty much everything you would need in a home,"" evacuee Pat Wilsoe told CNN affiliate WAPT. Vicksburg resident Hoover Youenger told the station his home had several feet of water in it. ""In a way, it feels like a big loss, but with Mother Nature you can't do anything about it,"" he said, WAPT reported. Severe storms are likely Saturday and Sunday in the Mississippi River, Ohio River and Tennessee River valleys. Up to 3 inches of rain per hour are possible, with heavier storms on Sunday. The rain could lead to secondary crests and higher crests along the Mississippi from Memphis, Tennessee, southward, CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said. Some greeted the cresting floodwaters -- which have damaged hundreds of homes and displaced 2,000 Vicksburg residents -- with relief. Others just went to work. Rusty Larsen, owner of Rusty's River Front Grill in Vicksburg, told CNN affiliate WJTV that his business has picked up some with the floods. ""We stay busy most days anyway, but there's been a lot of people downtown,"" he said. ""I see a lot of local people. Some of them are tourists. Everybody wants to come see the water."" Local officials caution that some area residents may have to wait to return to their homes. Flooded houses pose a variety of dangers, they said. Rising floodwaters bring debris, hazardous waste and gas leaks, and force snakes or other potentially dangerous animals from their habitats and into residential areas. ""Right now we're moving to the recovery stage,"" Vicksburg Mayor Paul Winfield told CNN. ""Our first priority, I believe, should be public safety, to continue to encourage our residents and onlookers to stay free of the water."" Law enforcement officials are patrolling evacuated areas to help ensure that abandoned homes and businesses aren't burglarized, Winfield said. And each flooded property must be assessed before an owner can return to it, he said. Warren County, which includes Vicksburg, has ""several hundred homes that have water"" and about 2,000 residents have been displaced, Sheriff Martin Pace said. County residents are accustomed to flooding and know what to do, but none have experienced it at this magnitude, according to Pace. A slide was detected on the mainline Mississippi levee at Lake Albemarle, the Corps of Engineers said Thursday. That occurs when the integrity of a levee is undermined because dirt and sand are being eroded, spokeswoman Eileen Williamson said. Crews are working around the clock to help fill the gaps. If the levee fails, thousands of homes and more than one million acres would be flooded, according to Peter Nimrod, the Mississippi Levee Board's chief engineer. ""So it's very important we hold this levee together,"" he said. Farther south, where the Mississippi River has not yet crested, residents were working to clear out their homes and find ways to get by. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal has asked for federal assistance in grappling with flooding stemming from the Morganza Spillway, where 17 bays have been opened in hopes of sparing New Orleans farther downstream. So far, the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development has delivered nearly 150,000 sandbags, 30,000 cubic yards of sand and 33,000 linear feet of fabric-lined baskets, the governor's office said. Approximately 1,150 Louisiana National Guard members have been mobilized. Mandatory evacuations were in effect Saturday in Happy Town and the Sherburne Wildlife Management Area, the St. Martin Parish Sheriff's Office said. Officials will decide whether evacuations are needed in Butte La Rose on Monday. Spillway gates are likely to be open for weeks, meaning it will be some time before the river falls below flood stage, allowing evacuees to return. The flood is the most significant to hit the lower Mississippi River valley since at least 1937. It has affected nine states so far: Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Ohio, Indiana, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi.

"Kennedy Space Center, Florida (CNN) -- NASA launched its Ares I-X rocket Wednesday, after multiple delays over two days because of bad weather. The 327-foot rocket -- which NASA considers the world's largest -- took off at 11:30 a.m. ET, 30 minutes before a noon deadline for the launch. It rose about 24 miles. About two minutes after liftoff, the first-stage, reusable rocket booster fell into the Atlantic, where it was to be picked up by a ship. It was the first flight test for the Constellation Program, NASA's next-generation spacecraft and launch vehicle system. The rocket's launch is part of NASA's mission to someday return astronauts to the moon and later travel to Mars. NASA spokesman George Diller, who was moderating the launch preparations for broadcasters, communicated the frustration as launches were repeatedly called off with just minutes to go. After 11 a.m., it appeared there would be a narrow window for a liftoff, and a half-hour later the rocket roared skyward. ""I can't tell you how proud I am of all of you,"" Ed Mango, Ares I-X launch director, told engineers and others inside the center after the launch. ""That was just one of the most beautiful rocket launches I've ever seen."" ""It shows what we can do when we have a common goal."" As the clock ticked toward noon, NASA officials nervously awaited all-clears for technical items and a weather clearance from weather officer Kathy Winters who, time and again, said conditions were ""red,"" meaning a no-go. A reconnaissance plane was giving her frequent weather reports. She kept looking for a break in the high-level clouds.  ""It's a very dynamic situation,"" Winters said. Before the launch, the space agency had begun negotiating with the Air Force to see if a Thursday launch attempt was possible. Failing that, NASA couldn't have tried again until November 16. NASA's primary concern was the high-level, cold clouds that can cause triboelectrification, or the production of a kind of static electricity, similar to what happens when you walk across a carpet, then touch something. If static surrounds the rocket, it can interfere with radio signals sent by or to the rocket. The Constellation Program has been developing new vehicles to replace space shuttles, which will be phased out in 2010. If the program moves forward, the Orion capsule atop the Ares rocket will not be ready to take astronauts into space until at least 2015, leaving a gap of at least five years in which the only way the United States would be able to put humans in orbit would be by hitching a ride with the Russians. Part of the test rocket mission is for scientists to try out three massive main parachutes, measuring 150 feet in diameter and weighing one ton each -- the largest rocket parachutes ever manufactured. The parachutes are a primary element of the rocket's deceleration system, NASA says. After the rocket is successfully launched, the parachutes are to open at the same time, ""providing the drag necessary to slow the descent of the huge solid rocket motor for a soft landing in the ocean,"" the agency says on its Web site. The two parts of the rocket are to separate at about 130,000 feet. The top of the rocket, known as the upper stage, includes a mock Orion crew capsule and a launch abort system. The upper stage will continue its ascent until gravity forces its return to Earth, after which it will fall into the Atlantic Ocean. The launch comes at a critical time, when NASA is waiting for President Obama to decide future funding for the agency. An independent committee reviewing the future of space flight recently reported that the U.S. space program appears to be pursuing goals that exceed current funding. The committee also recommended to the White House that funding for NASA's under-construction international space station should be extended until 2020. CNN's Kim Segal and John Zarrella contributed to this report.","NEW: ""One of the most beautiful rocket launches I've ever seen,"" says launch director .

"(CNN) -- Seven leaders of Iran's Baha'i minority went on trial in Tehran Tuesday accused of spying for Israel, a charge their supporters say is motivated by religious discrimination. The seven -- two women and five men -- are also accused of spreading propaganda against the Islamic republic and committing religious offenses, charges that can carry the death penalty. ""We understand that no observers were allowed in the court,"" said Diane Ala'i, the Baha'i International Community's representative to the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland. ""We understand that even the lawyers had to argue their way inside the court -- lawyers who, in any case, had virtually no access to the accused for nearly two years."" At the same time, interrogators from the intelligence ministry and a film crew were seen going into the courtroom, Ala'i said. ""We find this completely outrageous, given that these seven have been held purely because of their religious beliefs, in total contradiction to any human rights standards,"" she said. They have been held at Tehran's Evin prison since their arrests in March and May 2008. Their trial was delayed twice. Ala'i said it was because the Iranian regime had no basis for a case. The U.S. State Department on Monday condemned Iran's decision to try the leaders. ""Authorities have detained these persons for more than 20 months, without making public any evidence against them and giving them little access to legal counsel,"" the department said in a statement. Leonard Leo, U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom chairman, said his group is ""extremely concerned about the fate of the seven"" -- who risk facing the death penalty. ""It appears that the Iranian government has already predetermined the outcome, and is once again using its courts as an instrument of religious persecution in blatant violation of international human rights law,"" Leo said. ""We commend the U.S. government on its strong statement of today and we urge the international community to put the Iranian government on notice that they will be held to account should the sham trial continue this week."" USCIRF is an independent, bipartisan U.S. federal government commission that reviews information about violations of religious freedom across the world and makes policy recommendations to the president, the secretary of state and Congress. The Baha'i faith originated in 19th century Persia, but the constitution of today's Islamic republic does not recognize it as a religion and considers followers as apostates. The Iranian government denies mistreating Baha'is, who number about 300,000 in Iran and are the nation's largest non-Muslim religious minority, according to Baha'i International. But the Baha'is say believers in Iran are victims of systematic discrimination and targets of violence.","The seven are charged with spying, spreading propaganda against Iran and religious offenses .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Taiwan's de facto representative offices in Hong Kong and Macau -- China's two special administration regions (SAR) -- will come out of hiding this week after operating incognito for nearly 45 years, a move that experts say defines a thawing of historically frosty cross-strait relations. Functioning in Hong Kong under the moniker of the ""Chung Hwa Travel Service"" since the 1966 Chinese Cultural Revolution, the office has often been mistaken as a private travel company because of its title, said James Shi Chu, Taiwan's Director General of Hong Kong & Macau Affairs. The new office will be renamed and upgraded on July 15 to the Taipei Economic and Cultural Affairs office, a title indicative of its true functions, Chu said. The decision to rename Taipei's hub in Hong Kong delineates a warming of relations between Beijing and Taipei, said Joseph Cheng, a professor of political science at Hong Kong City University. And although Taiwan liaised solely with Hong Kong, Cheng said the local government ""dared not do anything with Taiwan without the formal approval of Beijing, period."" Contact between China and Taiwan -- a self-ruled island -- has historically been defined by instability and limited diplomatic communication, Cheng said. China views Taiwan as a breakaway province, separated since the civil war of the 1940s. But relations began improving shortly after the 2008 election of current Taiwan President, Ma Ying-jeou. Although Ma is the leader of the Kuomintang Party (KMT) -- which lost control of mainland China to the Chinese Communist Party during the Chinese civil war in 1949 -- his policies have been largely friendly toward mainland China since being elected. Taiwan is also Hong Kong's fourth largest trading partner, with a total trade value of more than US$35 billion, according to the Hong Kong government. Mainland China remains Hong Kong's most lucrative trade partner, valued at roughly US$400 billion - just fewer than 50% of the SAR's total trade activity. Because of its misleading name, the Hong Kong office's efforts to improve economic and cultural relations were ""undermined,"" Chu explained. ""In Taiwan, the re-designation of the Chung Hwa Travel Service has become the so-called barometer to gauge the relationship between Hong Kong and Taiwan."" The current relationship is ""extremely close,"" Chu said, in both economics and tourism. He said that 31,000 flights helped more than 3 million people from both sides visit each other for business and pleasure in 2010. Chu insisted that Taipei had no formal or informal contact with Beijing over the upgrading of their economic and cultural office in Hong Kong or Macau. ""Over the past eight months, we directly dealt with the Hong Kong authority only. We had no discussion on this with Beijing,"" Chu said. ""But I wouldn't be surprised if the Hong Kong government sought from Beijing for these negotiations."" However, Beijing government spokesman Yang Yi welcomed the announcement, heralding the upgrading of relations as a milestone in cross-strait relations. ""This is a remarkable step in the development in Taiwan-Hong Kong-Macau relations, it's also a great achievement of the improving relationship among the four districts [of the] cross-strait,"" Yang said in an interview with Taiwan's Central News Agency. Chu said the Taiwan Cabinet also approved Hong Kong's request to open an analogous economic and cultural office in Taipei. The new office will operate in a similar fashion to Hong Kong's economic offices in mainland China and facilitate ""trade between Hong Kong and Taiwan, investment promotion and enhancing cultural exchanges between the two places,"" the Hong Kong government said in a statement. ""The formal setting up of Hong Kong's multi-functional office in Taiwan signifies that the development of Hong Kong-Taiwan relations has entered a new phase,"" Hong Kong's Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau told CNN in a statement. ""We believe that there will be more frequent interaction between Hong Kong and Taiwan, and that the dimension of work will be deepened."" Under the current ""one country, two systems"" policy -- which defines China's policy toward its two SARs --, Hong Kong and Macau enjoy a high degree of autonomy, a capitalist economy and a political system separate from the mainland. Mainland China, however, is responsible for the defense of the two regions as well as their foreign affairs. These stipulations are slated to end when the two regions are reintegrated with mainland China in 2047 and 2049, respectively. Hong Kong University professor Danny Gittings said the announcement marked a significant step toward normalizing relations between China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau. ""This certainly is unprecedented because Hong Kong has never had an office in Taiwan,"" said Gittings, the program director at the school's college of humanities and law. ""You couldn't even conceive this until relations became much warmer.""

"(CNN) -- Imagine a world in which every major company in America flew hundreds of thousands of drones overhead, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year, collecting data on what Americans were doing down below. It's a chilling thought that would engender howls of outrage. Now imagine that millions of Americans walk around each day wearing the equivalent of a drone on their head: a device capable of capturing video and audio recordings of everything that happens around them. And imagine that these devices upload the data to large-scale commercial enterprises that are able to collect the recordings from each and every American and integrate them together to form a minute-by-minute tracking of the activities of millions. That is almost precisely the vision of the future that lies directly ahead of us. Not, of course, with wearable drones but with wearable Internet-connected equipment. This new technology -- whether in the form of glasses or watches -- may unobtrusively capture video data in real time, store it in the cloud and allow for it to be analyzed. The pros and cons of surveillance cameras . Some will say these new devices are no different from existing technology, like handheld video cameras or iPhones with audio recording functions. But there's a huge distinction. The emerging new technology is not designed with significant storage capacity. Instead, its default mode is for all data to be automatically uploaded to cloud servers, where aggregation and back-end analytic capacity resides. So, who owns and what happens to the user's data? Can the entire database be mined and analyzed for commercial purposes? What rules will apply when law enforcement seeks access to the data for a criminal or national security investigation? For how long will the data be retained? As some members of the Supreme Court recognized last year when they considered the use of only a single stream of data -- GPS location -- creating a life stream of data points paints a mosaic picture of a person's actions and habits. Who owns that mosaic? Service providers may argue that the terms of service approved by customers will set limitations on how their collected data can be used. But even if customers can truly make informed decisions about the storage and handling of such data, they have no right to consent to the use of data that is collected about passersbys whom they record, intentionally or not. Snap a photo by winking your eye? Ubiquitous street video streaming will capture images of many people who haven't volunteered to have their images collected, collated and analyzed. Even those who might be willing to forgo some degree of privacy to enhance national security should be concerned about a corporate America that will have an unrestricted continuous video record of millions. What is to prevent a corporation from targeting a particular individual, using face recognition technology to assemble all uploaded videos in which he appears, and effectively constructing a surveillance record that can be used to analyze his life? Opinion: Surveillance state no answer to terror . Concerns like this have motivated at least one bar owner to ban Google Glass from the premises. The proprietor thinks that continuous observation of patrons in the bar will strip them of their anonymity and put a damper on their spontaneity. In other words, why go to a bar when someone there is wearing a device that may be recording your every bad joke after you've had too many drinks? Maybe the market can take care of this problem. But the likely pervasiveness of this type of technology convinces me that government must play a regulatory role. Before we get too far down this road of ubiquitous surveillance, real-time upload and comprehensive analytics by cloud providers, we should pause to consider the implications. We need to consider what rights consumers have, and what rights nonparticipant third parties should have. We need to be judicious in how to balance innovation with privacy. The Federal Trade Commission and Congress need to take a look at this new technology before it becomes common. The new data collection platforms right in front of us are much more likely to affect our lives than is the prospect of drones overhead surveilling American citizens. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael Chertoff.","Michael Chertoff: A world in which drones fly overhead 24/7 is a chilling thought .

"Washington (CNN) -- Forced federal spending cuts have had a ""devastating impact"" on judicial operations nationwide, prompting a request to Congress for emergency funds to keep operations going at minimal levels, court officials say. The effects of the so-called budget sequester that took effect in March has been particularly hard on the judicial branch. The impact includes delays of civil and bankruptcy cases; furloughs of hundreds of court staff and federal public defenders. There have been reductions in court security as well as programs to monitor criminals on probation. ""We look to Congress to recognize the uncontrollable nature of our workload and provide the resources needed to perform this essential work,"" Judge Julia Gibbons told a Senate Judiciary subcommittee on Tuesday. ""If sufficient funding is not provided to the courts, we cannot provide the people of the United States the type of justice system that has been a hallmark of our liberty throughout the nation's history,"" Gibbons said. The judiciary's budget has been cut under sequester nationwide by nearly $350 million for the current fiscal year, which ends September 30. ""Emergency measures"" have been imposed by the Judiciary Conference, the federal court's internal policy arm. ""All aspects of court operations have been severely curtailed"" as a result said Gibbons, a federal appeals court judge in Memphis, who also heads the administrative conference's Budget Committee. The sequester has hit agencies throughout the government. But Congress has already granted some budget flexibility for homeland security, agriculture inspections, veterans services, and air traffic controllers. Congress this week was asked to provide $73 million in supplemental emergency funding to keep federal courts running properly. While courts have to deal with cuts, federal prosecutors do not at the moment. Judicial officials have already begun implementing staggered cuts to such areas as staff salaries, court security and federal public defenders. Court administrators have also warned civil jury trials may be stopped, if across-the-board funding cuts are not stopped. One high-profile case delayed due to the cuts is the criminal prosecution of accused former al-Qaeda spokesman Suleiman Abu Ghaith. He is a former son-in-law of Osama bin Laden and is among the most high-profile terror suspects to face justice on American soil. His trial has been postponed until January 2014 after his court-appointed lawyers said budget cutbacks left their office-short staffed. Separately, large numbers of court employees have been furloughed -- amounting to 8,600 court staff days and 12,500 public defender days. Nationwide the federal courts have been given individual discretion to implement furlough plans.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- The Chinese authorities have contested reports that three Tibetans set themselves on fire last week in a remote area of southwestern China. The conflicting accounts followed an increase in security measures by the Chinese authorities in Ganzi, an ethnically Tibetan area of Sichuan Province, in response to violent protests that took place last month. The unrest has been fueled in part by reports of a string of self-immolations by Tibetans over the past year amid anger and despair over Chinese rule. Radio Free Asia, a U.S.-based nonprofit group, reported over the weekend that the three Tibetans had set fire to themselves on Friday morning in a village known as Phuwu and that one of them had died as a result. The group, which broadcasts in Asian countries that it says lack ""full and free news media,"" attributed the information to unidentified sources. According to Radio Free Asia, Phuwu is in the county of Seda in Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, which is home to a population that is nearly 80% Tibetan. Seda is known by Tibetans as Serthar. Free Tibet, a London-based organization that campaigns against Chinese rule in the Tibetan region, also reported the self-immolations on its website. It did not specify where it got the information from. But Global Times, an English-language newspaper run by the Chinese Communist Party, published an article Monday that disputed that version of events. It cited local government officials as saying that no self-immolations had taken place recently. ""Everything is all right here, although we still have no Internet access,"" the newspaper cited Wang Yongkang, secretary of Seda county's Party committee, as saying Sunday. A restriction on communications has been part of the security clampdown in the area. Wang said there had been rumors that some Tibetans would set themselves on fire but that ""it has not happened,"" according to Global Times. The newspaper also cited Zhang Yang, an official from the publicity department of the Party committee of Sichuan Province, as saying that that he had not heard of any self-immolations over the weekend. Calls by CNN to government offices in Seda went unanswered Monday. The violence that has taken place in Ganzi recently appears to be the worst between ethnic Tibetans and the Chinese authorities since 2008, when deadly unrest in the Tibetan capital, Lhasa, left at least 22 people dead. The Chinese government's version of events in the region has regularly differed from those of groups like Free Tibet and the International Campaign for Tibet. Those advocacy groups have reported that the Chinese authorities have fired on unarmed protesters in at least three places in the past two weeks, killing several and wounding dozens. The Chinese state-run media have reported that at least one protester was killed in the clashes, but that the police fired in self-defense after the Tibetans attacked them. China has denounced the accounts of the violence by the advocacy groups as ""ill-intentioned hype"" by ""overseas secessionist groups attempting to distort the truth and discredit the Chinese government."" Last week, the Chinese authorities blacked out a CNN television report on the situation in the region. Tibetans in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan, told CNN that they wished for more freedom and the return of the Dalai Lama, their spiritual leader who fled to India during an uprising against Chinese rule in 1959. Pro-Tibetan groups claim Tibetans have gradually become the minority population in their own homeland, as Han Chinese -- China's main ethnic group -- have migrated to the region. Resentment among Tibetans spilled over in 2008 when a protest in Lhasa turned violent, as Tibetan mobs burned vehicles and shops and attacked ethnic Chinese. Tibetan exiles say more than 200 people died when Chinese security forces clamped down, but Beijing denies this, saying 22 people, mostly Chinese civilians, died during riots. Activists say tensions have remained high ever since.","Overseas groups have reported that three Tibetans set fire to themselves in China .

"(CNN) -- It's not been an excellent year on television for LGBT characters. On Friday GLAAD released two of its reports, the seventh annual Network Responsibility Index and the 18th annual Where We Are on TV report, and none of the networks received an excellent rating for having diverse LGBT characters and stories. ABC, ABC Family, CW, FOX, MTV, NBC and Showtime were rated as ""good""; CBS, FX, HBO, TLC, TNT and USA were ""adequate""; and History and TBS received ""failing"" marks. The ratings in the index were based on LGBT-inclusive content between June 2012 and May 2013, while Where We Are on TV relied on a character count and analysis of scripted characters in the upcoming 2013-2014 season. According to the data, the percentage of primetime broadcast scripted LGBT series regulars dropped to 3.3% from a record high of 4.4% last season. There was diversity, however. The report showed that there will be an equal number of women and men among LGBT characters during the 2013-2014 broadcast season, which means the storylines are moving beyond just featuring white gay males. ""Last season was a stellar one when it comes to the sheer number of gay, lesbian and bisexual representations on television, though diversity within those storylines showed room for improvement,"" said a statement from GLAAD's Wilson Cruz. ""Though the number of LGBT characters dropped this season, shows like 'The Fosters,' with an interracial female couple raising a family, and characters like Unique on 'Glee' have not only moved the conversation about LGBT people forward, but are also a hit with audiences."" Some of the other findings include: . ""Our television images not only reach American audiences, but countless others around the world,"" Cruz said.

"(CNN) -- Over the past few decades, there has been a shift toward more mountaintop removal coal mining in West Virginia. Mountaintop mining blasts apart mountains and deposits debris in nearby valleys to reach the rich coal seams buried inside. About 50% of U.S. power comes from burning coal, and about a third of West Virginia's coal is mined this way. But 57% of respondents to a CNN/ORC International Poll say they oppose mountaintop mining. Miners and coal companies say mountaintop removal projects provide much-needed jobs. Their opponents say the cost of those jobs -- to the environment and nearby communities -- is just too high.

"(CNN) -- Dylan Harris' latest venture in the tourist business has proved a resounding, if unlikely, success. A timely piece of good news too for the British travel agent from Wigan, an industrial town on the outskirts of Manchester, who has been keen to keep turnover strong in these austere times. It was always a bold business model: his company, Lupine Travel, specializes in holidays that normal people wouldn't dream of paying for, flying to destinations where even an innocent tourist could be suspected as a foreign agent. Iran used to be a popular resort for his customers. Ukraine too. But revenues fell when all their pre-booked tours to Chernobyl in July were cancelled following the government's ban on visitors to the area. Caddies: The good, the bad and the outspoken . The most captivating experience on offer though was the tour to North Korea. Harris hatched a plan to get more people interested in traveling to the last Stalinist enclave on earth: by setting up North Korea's very first international amateur golf championship. ""Someone contacted me saying they were interested in playing the golf course of North Korea. I said there was absolutely no possibility what so ever of that happening,"" Harris told CNN. The Korean crisis and the $74m course that nobody plays . ""But I asked them [the North Korean authorities] anyway and they were interested."" North Korea's golfing pedigree begins and ends with the oft-repeated legend that in 1994 that the DPRK's leader Kim Jong Il hit a world record 38, with five holes in one, at the Pyongyang Golf Course. Aside from being entirely false -- the course record is 73 shot by a local Korean golfer -- the game runs deeper than many would think with several courses to be found in the north. Along with the 18-hole Pyongyang Golf Course, and a nine hole course next to a hotel in the city, a $73 million championship course was built near the North-South border during calmer times. It was hoped that tourism could help bring valuable foreign currency north, whilst helping to mend relationships with the south. A pro-event was even held. As the political tensions heated up the course was abandoned, its empty fairways a metaphor for relations between the two countries. But Harris decided to go ahead with the inaugural 2011 DPRK Amateur Golf Open anyway. ""It is in the middle of the military range, so you get soldiers patrolling the fairways,"" he explained. ""It's 40 miles outside Pyongyang. The grass was a little bit longer than we were used to. It was inside a valley, with mountains all around. I don't think many people use it. It has 80 members, mainly diplomatic staff. "" A ramshackle field of 17 British, American, South African and Scandinavian golfers took part. More than 30 had applied, Harris explained, but several were dropped after it was discovered they were journalists. North Korea puts heavy restrictions on journalists entering the country. Reporters Without Border's annual Press Freedom Index ranked North Korea 177 out of 178 counties, making it one of most repressive countries in the world to be a journalist. ""Originally I was trying to play golf in Cuba, Iran and North Korea,"" explained 35-year-old Philadelphia-based computer programmer Warwick Poole, one of the 17 golfers who made the trip. ""I had an idea to play golf in these three countries for an adventure. Anywhere that has a poor reputation in the U.S. and see what golf was like over there. The list of unlikely places to play golf is diminishing. As the world opens up the list gets smaller and smaller every year."" Yet North Korea remains resolutely closed, making its first home-grown golf tournament all the more surprising. When Poole read about the tournament -- open to anyone that has an official handicap -- he thought it was a joke. But two months later he was getting on a train at the Chinese border headed for Pyongyang, terrified. ""I was so nervous about going in,"" he recalled. ""I left instructions with my family that if I didn't contact them within a day they should start looking for me."" But after arriving in the capital, seeing the wide, car-less boulevards, empty cities and ""fields full of crops, being worked by hand,"" he felt safe enough to stay. ""The course wasn't in fantastic condition, not terrible. It was like a municipal course in a southern town to look at it. The greens were interesting. Because the North Koreans are loath to get any foreign input they have done greens how they think they should do it. They were quite hilly. The out of bounds were everywhere."" So severe were the out of bounds -- a bi-product of being built next to a military firing range -- that many found it difficult to stay on the course from one hole to the next. ""We had a team of female North Korean caddies who would applaud every shot,"" said Warwick. ""I didn't play well. I shot 91. I was nervous on the first tee. With the female caddies there were 40 people there. TV cameras, including a North Korean TV crew, were watching it. I hit my first tee shot out of bounds."" Alas, Poole didn't claim the the DPRK AGO's first ever winner's trophy. That honor was reserved for the Finnish golfer Olli Lehtonen, clinching the course record after shooting a respectable 72. Now Harris believes that the tournament can help raise the profile of the sport in the country. ""There was one North Korean who played in it, the rest were watching it. It's too expensive for most people. But loads of people said they were going to take up the sport after watching it,"" he said hopefully. Recently the Korean government approved the 2012 DPRK Amateur Golf Open, meaning that Harris will be back next May with another batch of scratch golfers and curious hackers looking to play on one of the most hard to reach courses on the planet. The plan is to, one day, move to the empty $73 million championship course on the 38th parallel, but that might have to wait a while. ""We'd like to play it there but there's no chance at the moment because of the political situation,"" he admitted. ""They [the North Koreans] have seized some property off the South Koreans but I hope so. One day we will play it.""","Lupine travel set up North Korea's first international amateur golf championship .

"London (CNN) -- They looked like ""a normal couple"" as they left the hospital, one bystander said. Of course, most normal couples don't have a crowd of reporters, photographers and random well-wishers waiting for them to show off their new baby. Prince William and Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, emerged from St. Mary's Hospital in London on Tuesday evening to give the public its first view of the new heir to the British throne, joking that the still-unnamed boy had more hair than his father. Catherine and William took turns holding the child, wrapped in a cream-colored blanket, as they waved to well-wishers outside. The couple is ""still working on a name,"" William said, ""so we'll have that as soon as we can."" But he added, ""He's got her looks, thankfully."" The prince has already changed his first diaper, the couple told reporters. ""It's very emotional. It's such a special time,"" Catherine said. The couple left the hospital Tuesday evening, with William carrying the boy out in a car seat and installing him in the back of a black SUV. Then he got behind the wheel for the trip to their residence at Kensington Palace. On their way out, they walked out down the same steps where Diana, Princess of Wales, and Prince Charles gave the world its first look at Prince William 31 years ago. ""It was so exciting. It was fantastic,"" said Eliza Wells, one of those gathered outside the hospital. ""The crowd erupted, because everyone's been waiting so long for it."" William and Catherine ""both seemed very relaxed, even with the press there and the crowd,"" Wells said. ""They just seemed like a normal couple."" Shortly before the departure, Charles stopped by for a brief visit with his first grandchild, accompanied by his wife, Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall. He told reporters it was ""marvelous."" And Catherine's parents, Carole and Michael Middleton, visited earlier, with Carole Middleton telling reporters the royal baby is ""absolutely beautiful."" She said both mother and baby are doing ""really well"" and that she and her husband were ""so thrilled"" at being grandparents. Royal baby: What's next? Bells, gun salutes . The 8-pound, 6-ounce boy was born Monday afternoon. He's third in line, behind Charles and William, for the British throne now held by his great-grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II. Tuesday, London echoed with the sound of cannonades and music to mark the birth. Guardsmen at Buckingham Palace, the queen's residence, played the Cliff Richard song ""Congratulations"" at the Changing of the Guard. The military ceremony, much beloved by tourists, involves a new guard exchanging duty with the old guard in the palace forecourt. The King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery in Green Park fired 41 shots in tribute to the boy, while the Honorable Artillery Company at the Tower of London fired 62 rounds. Interactive: World reacts to royal baby news . At the same time the bells of Westminster Abbey, where William and Catherine were married in April 2011, began to peal, in keeping with royal tradition, and were set to continue for more than three hours. The news of the boy's birth, announced about four hours after the event Monday, prompted cheers and celebration among the crowds of well-wishers outside Buckingham Palace. At least one group of well-wishers brought flowers, champagne and a card for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Social media networks were also abuzz with the news, which made headlines around the world. 'We could not be happier' The new parents spent some time with their baby before calling family members -- starting with the queen -- to announce the birth, a Kensington Palace source told CNN royal correspondent Max Foster. ""We could not be happier,"" said Prince William, according to the Kensington Palace source. Prince William remained at Catherine's side throughout the labor, and the baby was born naturally. An official bulletin was placed on a gilded easel outside Buckingham Palace. Confused about the royals? Follow this handy family tree . The celebrations for the arrival of the new prince -- whose title will be His Royal Highness Prince (the baby's name) of Cambridge -- were hard to miss in the capital. The fountains at Trafalgar Square were dyed blue; the BT Tower, a London landmark, flashed the words ""It's a boy;"" and the London Eye was illuminated in patriotic red, white and blue. Farther afield, Canada -- where the British monarch is head of state -- turned its side of the Niagara Falls blue to mark the birth, and the CN Tower in Toronto was lit up the same color. Betting on a name . It was a long wait for the media camped outside St. Mary's Hospital, but when the news of the birth finally came, the excitement of the moment was huge. The Sun newspaper, Britain's best-selling tabloid daily, changed its masthead Tuesday to ""The Son"" to mark the occasion, above a picture of the official birth announcement, while the Daily Express and Telegraph emblazoned ""It's a boy"" across their front pages. Recognizing that excitement over the prince's arrival is not universal, the Guardian newspaper's website lets users switch to a royal baby-free version of the home page. The front page of UK satirical magazine Private Eye simply says: ""Woman has baby."" Queen Ella? King Terry? What's in a royal name? Many bets are being placed as the wait continues for the baby's name to be announced. British bookmakers Ladbrokes have James as favorite, followed by Henry and George, Philip, Alexander and Richard. William's name was announced a few days after birth; his brother Harry's on departure from hospital. Some British parents have delayed naming their newborns in recent days in hopes of either copying or avoiding the royal name, he said. Royal joy . The official British Monarchy Twitter feed said: ""The Queen and Prince Philip are delighted at the news of the birth of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's baby."" Charles Spencer, brother of the late Diana, Princess of Wales, welcomed the birth of the baby. ""We're all so pleased: it's wonderful news,"" he said in a statement. ""My father always told us how Diana was born on just such a blisteringly hot day, at Sandringham, in July 1961. It's another very happy summer's day, half a century on."" Photos: House of Windsor babies . British Prime Minister David Cameron said, ""It is an important moment in the life of our nation, but I suppose above all, it's a wonderful moment for a warm and loving couple who got a brand new baby boy."" Tributes around the world . The British monarch is also head of state in 15 Commonwealth countries, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Belize and Jamaica. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper offered his country's congratulations on the birth of a future king. ""The arrival of the newest member of the Royal Family, a future Sovereign of Canada, is a highly anticipated moment for Canadians given the special and warm relationship that we share with our Royal Family,"" he said in a statement.

""Given the special relationship between us, the American people are pleased to join with the people of the United Kingdom as they celebrate the birth of the young prince."" Russia's President Vladimir Putin and Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also sent their congratulations. On Twitter, topics related to the royal baby jumped to the top of the trending list in the United Kingdom on Monday morning. Worldwide, hashtags such as #RoyalBabyBoy and #Will & Kate were trending later Monday.

"(CNN) -- A 2,000-pound European satellite burned up as it re-entered Earth's atmosphere early Monday, controllers reported. Re-entry was made close to 1 a.m. Monday (7 p.m. ET), the European Space Agency said. ""As expected, the satellite disintegrated in the high atmosphere and no damage to property has been reported,"" the space agency said. The Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer -- a European Space Agency satellite known shorthand as GOCE -- crossed over Siberia, the western Pacific Ocean, the eastern Indian Ocean and Antarctica upon its re-entry. The 5-meter (16-foot) satellite was launched in 2009 to map variations in the Earth's gravity in 3-D, provide ocean circulation patterns and make other measurements. Powered by solar panels and not-your-average lithium-ion battery, it lasted more than three times its expected lifespan before running out of juice on October 21. In March 2011, the ESA added another role -- as the ""first seismometer in orbit"" -- when GOCE detected sound waves from the massive earthquake that struck Japan.","NEW: Satellite disintegrated in the high atmosphere .

"(CNN) -- Snowmobiler Caleb Moore died Thursday, a week after a crash that has raised new safety concerns about the X Games. He was 25 years old. ""He will be truly missed and never forgotten,"" his family said in a statement. ""The family wishes to express their deep gratitude for all the prayers and support they have received from all the fans, friends and family around the world that Caleb has inspired. ... Arrangements for a celebration of life are being made and an announcement will be made in the coming days."" Moore, a freestyle snowmobiler, was attempting a backflip at the Winter X Games in Aspen, Colorado, when he couldn't rotate his machine enough to land properly. The skis dug into the lip of the slope, bringing the 450-pound snowmobile crashing down on him. The vehicle slammed into Moore's head and chest. ""We are deeply saddened by Caleb Moore's passing and our thoughts and prayers go out to his parents, Wade and Michelle, his brother, Colten, and the entire Moore family,"" ESPN, which organizes and televises the X Games, said in a statement. ""He will be remembered for his natural passion for life and his deep love for his family and friends, and he will always be an inspiration to everyone he touched in the action sports community. ""As a result of this accident we will conduct a thorough review of this discipline and adopt any appropriate changes to future X Games."" The statement added that the X Games have long worked on safety issues and that nevertheless, ""when the world's best compete at the highest level in any sport, risks remain. Caleb was a four-time X Games medalist attempting a move he has landed several times previously."" Colten Moore, 23, was also involved in an accident during Thursday's event. He was released from the hospital Saturday, according to his Facebook fan page. Caleb Moore's Facebook page is carrying messages from fans. ""R.I.P.

"(CNN) -- Tabitha and Lucas Rainey were beginning to get suspicious. The staff at Kentucky Children's Hospital kept telling them their infant son, Waylon, was recovering well from surgery. There had been a few bumps in the road, to be sure, but they said that was normal for a baby born with a severe heart defect. Months passed. Waylon remained in the intensive care unit. More complications arose. ""Is everything OK?"" the Raineys would ask. Yes, the doctors and nurses assured them. Everything was fine. Then one day, Tabitha Rainey says a cardiologist took her aside. ""She said, 'If I were you, I would move him,' "" Rainey remembers. ""She told me we should take him somewhere else.'"" A few days later, the Raineys arranged to have Waylon sent by helicopter to the University of Michigan. By then their son, not quite 3 months old, was in heart failure. Secret data . If Waylon Rainey had been born 30 years ago, he almost surely would have died a few days or weeks after birth. He has a condition called hypoplastic left heart syndrome, which means the left side of his heart is so malformed it can't pump blood. Today, surgeons perform a series of three operations on babies like Waylon. They're high-stakes surgeries -- cutting into an organ the size of a newborn baby's fist is tricky, to say the least. The blood vessels can be thinner than a piece of angel hair pasta, and one wrong move, one nick, one collapsed artery or vein can be deadly. These children are medically very fragile, and even the best surgeons lose patients. Surgeons track their deaths and complications and take great pride in the number of babies they save. Some are so proud they publish their success rates right on their hospital websites. Kentucky Children's Hospital is not one of these hospitals. 10 ways to get your child the best heart surgeon . Instead, Kentucky Children's Hospital has gone to great lengths to keep their pediatric heart surgery mortality rates a secret, citing patient privacy. Reporters and the Kentucky attorney general have asked for the mortality data, and the hospital has declined to give it to them. In April, the hospital went to court to keep the mortality rate private. Parents of babies treated at Kentucky Children's say the hospital's effort to keep the data a secret, coupled with troubling events over an eight-week period last year, makes them suspicious something at the hospital has gone terribly wrong. Four innocent lives . On August 30, Connor Wilson died after having surgery at Kentucky Children's Hospital for hypoplastic left heart syndrome. He was 6 months old. Three weeks later, Waylon Rainey had his surgery and later went into heart failure. Eleven days after that, newborn Jaxon Russell had a ""botched"" heart surgery at Kentucky Children's, according to his father. Waylon and Jaxon both survived after undergoing additional surgeries elsewhere. Less than three weeks later, on October 16, 6-month-old Rayshawn Lewis-Smith died after having heart surgeries at Kentucky Children's Hospital. That same month, Dr. Mark Plunkett, the hospital's chief heart surgeon -- and the only surgeon performing open-heart surgeries at the hospital -- went on paid leave, according to hospital spokesman Jay Blanton, and the hospital stopped doing heart surgeries. The parents say they didn't receive any explanation for why the surgeries stopped or why Plunkett left. A hospital spokeswoman said Plunkett was not available for comment. Parents react to story . CNN met with Connor, Waylon, and Jaxon's parents in Lexington, Kentucky. ""I think they're hiding something,"" says Nikki Crew, Connor's mother. Shannon Russell, Jaxon's father, said when his son had the second surgery at a different hospital it lasted four hours longer than expected because of infection and scar tissue left behind from the first surgery at Kentucky Children's. He said the second surgeon also found a hole in Jaxon's heart that the first surgeon missed, and corrected it. ""Our question is, how many other babies did this happen to?"" said Russell, who, with his wife Miranda, started Lil' Heart Sluggers to help other patients of children with congenital heart defects. A child's heart surgery amid Syria's carnage . 'OK isn't good enough for me' Dr. Michael Karpf is the first to admit his hospital's heart surgery program was not the best. Karpf is executive vice president for health affairs at the University of Kentucky's health care system, which includes Kentucky Children's Hospital. He said he put the pediatric heart surgery program on hold because the mortality rates weren't what he wanted them to be. ""They were OK, and OK isn't good enough for me,"" he said. ""It's got to be better. It's got to be good."" In December, a local reporter asked for more details. Brenna Angel, who worked for the university-owned radio station, asked the university for the mortality rate for all pediatric cardiothoracic surgeries performed over the past three years. She also asked for the number of surgeries performed by Plunkett, the date of his last surgery, and payments received for his surgeries. The university answered some of her questions: Plunkett operated on 110 children in 2010, 81 children in 2011 and 62 in 2012, often performing multiple surgeries on one child. In 2010, UK HealthCare received $288,522 in payments for his surgeries; in 2011, it was $255,380. But the university refused to release the date of Plunkett's last surgery or the mortality rate, citing the federal patient privacy law known as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. The university's lawyer said even though Angel was only asking for numbers, those numbers could eventually be linked to patients' names. ""Because Dr. Plunkett performs relatively few surgeries and because all of his surgeries are highly complex surgeries, it is relatively easy to deduce the identity of his patients,"" wrote William Thro, the university's general counsel. Angel filed an appeal with Attorney General Jack Conway, citing the state's Open Records Act, which requires that public agencies, such as public universities, open most of their records to the public. The attorney general asked the university to let him look at the data privately. The university said no, again citing patient privacy laws. The attorney general disagreed with the university and found it in violation of the open records law. In April, the university appealed the attorney general's decision to state circuit court. Hospital plans to do heart surgeries again . While the legal battle continues, the University of Kentucky has been doing its own internal review of the events last year. Plunkett returned from his month's leave of absence and then later resigned from the University of Kentucky to take a position with the University of Florida. Dr. Timothy Flynn, senior associate dean for clinical affairs at the University of Florida College of Medicine, said he spoke to surgeons who worked with Plunkett in Kentucky. ""They thought Dr. Plunkett performed very, very well,"" he said. ""We did the due diligence on his skills, and we think he'll do excellent in our environment."" The Kentucky hospital plans on hiring a new surgeon and opening the program back up again at some point. Karpf, the UK HealthCare executive, said parents don't need to worry -- when it reopens, the program will be first class. ""I won't be satisfied until our program is as good as anybody's program,"" he said. But Connor, Jaxon, and Waylon's parents aren't so sure. They say it's troubling that doctors and nurses gave them vague answers when they asked specific questions. For example, their sons had very complex surgeries, and they wanted to know how many times Plunkett had done their specific procedures and what his success rate had been. ""I want to know statistics, I want to know hard facts,"" said Lucas Rainey, Waylon's father. ""But they just said, 'We see this all the time. It'll be fine.' "" Karpf said he's not sure parents would understand statistics and rates. Karpf says he worries that most people would ""have a hard time understanding data."" ""Data is a complex issue,"" he said . Rainey said he and his wife understand data just fine -- they analyzed other hospitals' mortality rates when deciding where to send Waylon after the cardiologist suggested he be moved out of Kentucky Children's. Jaxon and Waylon are both at home now, and their parents are very pleased with the outpatient care from cardiologists at the University of Kentucky. But they said they'll continue to fight to have all safety data released to the public. ""We've not lost our child, and I thank God for that, but I'm standing up for the ones that have lost their kids -- the moms that I've had to stand in the hallway with and try to console because they've lost their children,"" Tabitha Rainey said. ""And they don't know what's happened and there are still no answers given to them.""

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Famed politician and Pakistani cricket star Imran Khan suffered spinal fractures and a head injury after a dramatic fall on the campaign trail, officials said. Khan is one of two frontrunners for Pakistani prime minister. He was injured Tuesday, just four days before the country's historic election -- Pakistan's first democratic transition of power. Khan and at least two guards were riding on a forklift up to a stage in Lahore, where Khan was to hold a rally. The men apparently lost their balance near the side of the stage and fell about 20 feet, clinging on to one another. Khan struck his head on a metal bar jutting out of machinery on the way down. His guards were not seriously injured. Election violence in Pakistan . Dr. Faisal Sultan of Shaukat Khanum Hospital said Khan suffered two fractures to his spine and needs to rest, but there's no sign of any neurological damage. From his hospital bed, Khan urged citizens to vote in Saturday's election. His injuries cut short a grueling schedule of 50 rallies across Pakistan in eight days. His main opponent, Nawaz Sharif, decided to postpone campaigning out of respect for Khan. Pakistan's democratic elections to select a new government have been plagued by deadly violence in recent weeks, and the Pakistani Taliban has claimed responsibility for several hits on candidates' campaigns. At least 16 people died Tuesday in two attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province; one attack targeted a Pakistan People's Party rally, and the other targeted a candidate for the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazal Ur Rehman group, police said. And on Monday, an explosion killed 18 people at a rally for Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazal Ur Rehman, a right-wing religious party with sympathies for the militant Taliban movement. Incidentally, the Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for that blast. It said it attacked because one of the candidates, Munir Orakzai, has handed over members of the mujahedeen to the United States. ""We will never forgive him nor leave him alive,"" a statement from Pakistani Taliban spokesman Ihsan Ullah Ihsan said. The anti-Taliban Awami National Party and the Muttahida Quami Movement and their personnel also have been targeted recently. On Saturday, three people were killed in back-to-back explosions near the MQM headquarters in Karachi, police said. The MQM, one of Pakistan's largest and most liberal parties, is firmly opposed to the Islamist militant group. Ihsan, the Pakistani Taliban spokesman, called CNN and said his group claimed responsibility for the Karachi explosions.

"(CNN) -- The spectacular rise of Jeremy Lin, the first Asian-American to achieve basketball stardom, has been utterly thrilling to witness. We've watched with pride as he's broken through stereotypes to prove that an Asian-American can play alongside -- and beat -- the best in the NBA. And we've been gratified by the way Lin's story has been embraced by the American public, with fans of all races cheering him on. But we've also been reminded of the ugliness with which Asians have often been depicted in American culture. After Lin's 38-point performance against the Los Angeles Lakers on February 10, Fox Sports columnist Jason Whitlock tweeted an offensive joke about Lin that played off stereotypes of Asians' lack of masculinity. Boxer Floyd Mayweather has asserted that ""all the hype"" around Lin is just ""because he's Asian."" And after New Orleans snapped the Knicks' Lin-led seven-game winning streak, ESPN posted a story with a headline that was an obvious anti-Chinese slur. Mayweather: 'Lin hype is based on race not talent' Stereotypes of Asians have been a staple of American popular culture since the 19th century, from newspaper cartoons of menacing, bucktoothed Chinese to film characters like the evil Dr. Fu Manchu and the bowing, pidgin-speaking Charlie Chan. In contemporary America, Asians -- when they appear at all -- are generally depicted as comical foreigners with ""ching-chong"" accents, from exchange student Long Duk Dong (""What's happening, hot stuff?"") in ""Sixteen Candles"" to Han Lee, the stereotyped Korean restaurant owner in CBS's hit comedy ""2 Broke Girls."" American culture tells us, in short, that Lin shouldn't exist. Every time he drives to the basket, he upends stereotypes of Asians as short, weak and nerdy. Every time he talks to the media, he dispels the idea that all Asian-Americans are like foreigners speaking broken English. Throughout his career, Lin has endured racist taunts from opponents and fans. And he's been overlooked repeatedly. After a spectacular high school career, no college offered him a scholarship. After he starred at Harvard, no NBA team drafted him. He was dropped by Golden State and Houston before landing on the Knicks' bench, and only got his shot when his team got desperate. Is the 'Linsanity' hype caused by race? Even as ""Linsanity"" gripped the nation, commentators and fellow players continued to play down Lin's talents. From the declarations that Lin was a ""fluke"" and a ""flash in the pan"" to Kobe Bryant's grudging comment that Lin was ""a testament to perseverance and hard work,"" the message was clear: Asian-Americans don't really belong on the basketball court. We've heard again and again that ""no one knew"" how good Lin was, but let's get real. Lin was overlooked because when people looked at him, they saw a stereotype, not a basketball star. As Lin led the Knicks to victory after victory, I watched with giddy excitement, but also a sense of worry: What would happen when the inevitable loss came? Would the resentment captured in Mayweather's tweet rear its head? Sure enough, the night the Knicks lost to the Hornets, there was the offensive headline from ESPN. I imagine that many Asian-Americans got the same sinking feeling as I did: Here is the moment where the media will turn on Lin, bringing back the racist stereotypes that have been held at bay by Lin's winning streak. To my surprise, something else happened. ESPN quickly apologized, then announced that it had fired the author of the headline and suspended an anchor who had used the same phrase on the air. This was remarkable, because although certain kinds of racist attacks against African-Americans in the media have become unacceptable, anti-Asian rhetoric typically goes unpunished. Asian-Americans have become accustomed to having our protests against media stereotypes shrugged off and ignored. But on this one, ESPN took quick action. Ex-ESPN writer says slur was 'honest mistake' Phil Yu, of the popular blog Angry Asian Man, wrote about this ""Jeremy Lin Effect."" Slurs and stereotypes that would previously have been used with impunity were getting a good, hard look, and a major media outlet responded to Asian-American critics with a swiftness that would have been unimaginable a few weeks ago. We shouldn't romanticize this: ESPN knows that Lin is the biggest story in sports right now, and it can't afford to alienate or offend those hungry for their daily dose of Lin. But perhaps that's precisely the point. Lin has become so big that simply by being himself -- an Asian-American, comfortable in his own skin, playing basketball brilliantly on the world's biggest stage and enjoying himself as he does it -- he may be revolutionizing our culture. The Jeremy Lin Effect won't end racism, but it does mean that Asian-Americans will never be seen the same way again.

"(CNN) -- A year after beating breast cancer, Peter Criss, a founding member of the rock band KISS, calls himself ""the luckiest man in the planet."" Peter Criss, now 63, said getting medical treatment early at the first sign of trouble saved his life. While some men feel embarrassed because of ""this macho crap,"" Criss said surviving breast cancer -- yes, men get it, too -- was actually a blessing. He was treated before the tumor could spread and said he's speaking about male breast cancer now -- during National Breast Cancer Awareness month -- to raise the profile of this rare disease. Criss, who played drums for KISS and was known as ""Catman,"" offered this advice to men who spot lumps in their breast: ""Don't sit around playing Mr. Tough Guy. Don't say 'It's going to go away.' It might not and you might not see life anymore and how beautiful that is."" The 63-year-old musician is now cancer free. Like many others, Criss wasn't aware men could get breast cancer. ""Even though we don't think of men as having breasts, they have breast tissue and are susceptible to getting breast cancer,"" said Dr. Sharon Giordano, an associate professor of medicine in the department of breast medical oncology at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. She is not involved in Criss' care. ""All men have some residual degree of breast tissue behind the nipples. It may be very small, but just like any part of the body can get cancer, that part of the body can get cancer,"" she said. Male cases are rarer than female breast cancer, making up less than 1 percent of total cases. According to the National Cancer Institute, in 2009 an estimated 192,370 women in the United States are expected to receive a diagnosis of breast cancer and about 40,170 are expected to die of the disease. Among men, there will be an estimated 1,910 new cases and 440 deaths. ""So many people must die from this,"" Criss said. ""Somebody has to step up to the plate and say something to get them aware of how dangerous this is. Lots of men die: They wait, they don't go in, they put it off.""  Watch Criss' interview. » . Criss joins a small group of men who have spoken publicly about having breast cancer. Several years ago, Richard Roundtree, the actor who played the title role in the 1970s ""Shaft"" films, revealed he had breast cancer. Experts say men tend to get a diagnosis at a later stage than women, because they don't believe they can get breast cancer, and don't get routine mammograms or breast exams.  Take the quiz on breast cancer. » . Breast cancer is ""actually easier to find in men for obvious reasons. They develop an asymmetrical lump in their breast,"" said Dr. Stanley Waintraub, co-chief of The John Theurer Cancer Center's division of breast oncology at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey. Men may ignore symptoms, such as lumps, pain in the breast or discharge from the nipples. ""A man has to know, if he has enlarged breasts, a lump, a discharge, just because he's a man, he is not immune to breast cancer,"" Waintraub said. When Criss spotted a painful lump in his left breast after a workout in 2007, he didn't wait. ""I go to the gym; I've been drumming since I was a kid. So I'm very aware of my body,"" he said. ""So when this happened I said, 'Jesus, what's this thing?' "" After consulting with his wife, who was battling a different type of cancer at the time, he sought medical attention. Criss had surgery in February 2008 to remove what the doctors thought was a harmless nodule. Later, he learned the nodule was actually breast cancer. ""I flipped out. I just couldn't believe it. It's a nightmare,"" he recalled. ""I was angry at everything. I couldn't believe I had this. I was a really angry guy for a long time."" Doctors removed the cancer in a March 2008 surgery. Because the cancer had been caught early, Criss did not need breast reconstruction or chemotherapy. The operation left no scars, so his doctor joked that Criss could still take his shirt off to play the drums. Criss responded with a laugh, ""I'm in my 60s. Those days are over."" Criss sang lead vocal and co-wrote one of KISS' most famous songs, ""Beth."" He left the band in 1980. He rejoined the band for a reunion tour in the mid-1990s and stayed on, eventually leaving again in 2004. He still plays the drums, and has started working on a record and an autobiography. For men, ""because of the lack of awareness, it can be stigmatizing to feel like they have a female disease when they're a man,"" Giordano said. In the sea of pink ribbons, men who have breast cancer may feel isolated. To build a network among them, the John W. Nick Foundation started connecting male breast cancer survivors in 1996. ""They talk with one another,"" said the founder, Nancy Nick, whose father died of the disease. ""It's the greatest thing for healing. They learn they're not alone. Second, they learn about protocol and treatment. They can compare their treatments and the care their doctor is giving them."" Criss credits his wife and his Catholic faith for pulling him through the difficult times. Every year, he gets a mammogram; he had his checkup two weeks ago. ""I left smiling like a Cheshire cat. Now, I'm coming around, I'm just so grateful,"" he said. The causes of breast cancer remain unknown. But like women, men's risk of  breast cancer increases if they inherit BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutations. Criss said he learned that breast cancer ran in his family, so he called his sisters, nieces, daughter and even his brother about possible risks. ""It's just important -- just go get checked out,"" said Criss. ""It's not like you're going to lose your manhood.""","Peter Criss, original drummer for KISS, talks about his breast cancer .

"(CNN) -- Creating more economic opportunities will be Mexico's greatest weapon in the war on drugs, the country's president-elect said Tuesday. ""That, I think, is going to be the best way my government can prevent organized crime,"" President-elect Enrique Pena Nieto told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. Without jobs and social programs, he said, ""millions of my countrymen have no other option than to dedicate themselves sometimes to criminal activity."" The wide-ranging interview was recorded just a few hours before the incoming leader met with U.S. President Barack Obama in Washington. In his first meeting with Obama, Pena Nieto said he planned to focus on building trust and boosting economic ties to create jobs. Mexican leader eyes economic ties with U.S. ""We've lost presence and competitiveness on the international market. ... There's still space, an opportunity, to achieve greater integration as far as productivity, which will allow us to improve the competitive conditions for creating jobs across North America,"" he said. Pena Nieto, 46, said his security strategy will focus on reducing the drug-related violence that took 60,000 lives during his predecessor's six-year term, though he provided few specifics about how he would stem the violence or what aspects of outgoing President Felipe Caderon's strategy he will change. ""We will keep the policies that I think work,"" he said, ""including cooperation with the United States to effectively fight organized crime."" The way that fight is waged may have to change, he said, in light of changing U.S. policies such as the recent referendums legalizing marijuana for recreational use in Colorado and Washington state. ""Personally, I am not in favor of legalization of drugs ... because it's not just about marijuana. It seems to me that is a gateway through which people will start taking much more harmful drugs,"" Pena Nieto said. ""But it's clear that this thing that has happened in two states in the near future could bring us to rethinking the strategy."" Opinion: To-do list for Obama and Mexico's new president . Pena Nieto won Mexico's July presidential vote, marking a return to power for his Institutional Revolutionary Party, which ruled Mexico for more than 70 years until 2000, when Vicente Fox of the conservative National Action Party won the presidency. On the campaign trail, some political opponents of Pena Nieto warned that negotiating with drug cartels and gangs could be on his agenda -- an accusation that Pena Nieto repeatedly denied. But his denials didn't squelch speculation on both sides of the border that negotiating with cartels -- or at least easing the pressure on them -- could be on the table. In a June congressional hearing, U.S. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner said the war on drugs was nearing a ""potential crossroad,"" referring to Pena Nieto's plan and his party's political history. ""While in power, the PRI minimized violence by turning a blind eye to the cartels,"" the Wisconsin Republican said, noting that Pena Nieto did ""not emphasize stopping drug shipments or capturing kingpins."" In a statement the next day, Pena Nieto's campaign said he was committed to combatting organized crime. ""The law is applied, it is never negotiated,"" the statement said. In addition to meeting with Obama in Washington Tuesday, Pena Nieto also spoke with other officials, including U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and U.S. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Pena Nieto will take office Saturday in an inauguration ceremony in Mexico City, replacing Calderon of the National Action Party, who has served as president since 2006.

"(CNN) -- The police department in Keene, New Hampshire, wants to identify and prosecute the people who threw objects at police, overturned a car, set fires and engaged in other ""riotous behavior"" Saturday and Sunday at the city's annual Pumpkin Festival, the city government said Monday. The fire department treated 30 people for injuries, mostly those hit by thrown objects, law enforcement authorities said at a news conference. Full bottles and cans of alcohol and even billiard balls were hurled through the air, police said. People shouted expletives at officers, started fires in the road and flipped over a vehicle, Keene Police Chief Kenneth Meola said. Crowds were so hostile that firefighters had trouble reaching the injured, he said. Eighty-four people were arrested over the weekend, Meola said, and more arrests are expected. Police said high school and college students used social media to spread word about the event, held near Keene State College. The school's president, Anne Huot said some outside the community had billed the event ""as a destination for destructive and raucous behavior."" Steven French, 18, who was visiting from Haverhill, Massachusetts, described the chaotic scene to the local paper, The Keene Sentinel, as ""wicked."" ""It's just like a rush. You're revolting from the cops,"" he told the paper Saturday night. ""It's a blast to do things that you're not supposed to do."" Students could be expelled . Many of the suspects are from other New England colleges and the schools will trade information in an attempt to locate the suspects, Huot told reporters. Besides being charged with crimes, Keene State students could be expelled if they participated, she said. Police said they'll use social media in trying to locate and identify suspects. Meola said the problem started about 1 p.m. Saturday when police tried to break up an unruly crowd of about 1,000 people at the festival. Police in riot gear used tear gas and pepper spray to to disperse the group. A second group of about the same size also started throwing objects at police, he said. The groups eventually moved to another spot where they were partially contained, Meola said. Some of the suspects spilled over onto the campus and damaged property there, he said. ""This went on for approximately eight hours,"" he said. ""The potential for somebody being seriously injured or killed was there,"" said Col. Robert Quinn of the New Hampshire State Police. Police used about 100 pepper balls and finally ran out, Meola said. Officers then resorted to ""sponge rounds,"" which he said were ""similar to an extended baton kind of stroke."" Police had problems last year . Keene police called in backup from the New Hampshire State Police and other nearby police forces. Most of the injured were students. ""I got hit with a Jack Daniel's (whiskey) bottle, like across the face,"" Keene State student Roger Creekmore told WMUR. The disturbances started early Saturday afternoon. Bonfires burned into the early hours of Sunday morning on city streets that were littered with broken beer and liquor bottles, video from CNN affiliate WMUR showed. Police reported problems at last year's pumpkin festival, but not to this extent, Meola said. The Sentinel reported 140 arrests last year. ""This wasn't like a party we had to go break up,"" he said. ""This was out in the public. Nobody organized it. It happened on its own."" Because of the arrests and injuries at past festivals, the community held forums in recent years -- inviting police and emergency room doctors as well as residents -- to explore ways to mitigate the violence, vandalism and littering that come with the celebration. Town to discuss festival future . Keene Mayor Kendall W. Lane said public forums will be held in December to discuss the future of the Pumpkin Festival. This was the 24th consecutive year it's been held. Huot said she was encouraged to see many students come out voluntarily Sunday morning to help clean up the debris from the disturbance. The pumpkin festival is a source of pride for the community of 23,000 people about 80 miles northwest of Boston. Last year, the event set a world record with 30,581 lit jack-o'-lanterns, according to the festival's website. ""It's ridiculous. It's not Pumpkin Fest,"" Jacob Gowans, another Keene State student, told WMUR. ""We're supposed to have a fun weekend. This is stupid.""

"(CNN) -- In the dying days of the Battle of Mogadishu two years ago, on the beachside base used by Ugandan African Union troops in their successful campaign to drive Al-Shabaab from the capital, I came across three new prisoners. Handcuffed, dirty and dejected, the eldest of them was 17, the youngest 15. They were volunteers, they said, who had put their hands up when an Al-Shabaab recruiter came to their school. This had happened a fortnight before; they had surrendered when they became separated from their unit and ran out of bullets. Why, I asked, had they put their hands up in the first place? The boys all looked at each other. ""We were given a piece of fruit every day,"" one of them said. I later interviewed several Al-Shabaab deserters in a government camp set aside for the purpose, prepared for anti-Western hostility from a gang of hardened jihadist militants. Instead I found a crowd of teenagers, spirited, unruly, and for the most part instantly likeable. It was disorienting, but in their Lakers T-shirts and Nile tracksuits, they resembled schoolboys anywhere in the world. Their average age was 15; one of them, Liban, was 9. Like so many young Somalis in this shattered country, Liban was an orphan; the militants, for whom he had already fought for two years, were his surrogate family. ""I'm not scared!"" he trilled. ""I'm ready to fight again -- for the government!"" These boy soldiers, I found, had little interest in Islamist ideology. Most of them had decided to join Al-Shabaab -- particularly in 2011, a famine year -- simply to survive. They wanted what all young people want everywhere: security, food and water, and (if a little older than Liban) at least the prospect of an education, a job, a family, a home -- the chance of a half-decent life. And until such time as the Mogadishu government, and by extension the Western governments who support it, finds ways to start meeting those basic needs, Al-Shabaab will likely continue to find support. Children have always been useful to Al-Shabaab, an organization whose name, after all, means ""the youth"" or ""the lads"" in Arabic. Children are capable of the most terrifying, feral violence when armed, as well as insane courage in the battlefield. Liban's moral compass was not so much awry as completely absent: No one had ever shown him one. He made life in Al-Shabaab sound like ""Lord of the Flies"" with automatic weapons. A good dollop of jihadi claptrap helps put backbone into some of them. The impressionability of some young Somali recruits is as breathtaking as the cynicism and hypocrisy of their mentors. Martyrs for Islam, famously, are rewarded with the attentions of 72 virgins in the afterlife. Adult trainers are said on one occasion to have shown their pupils Bollywood DVDs and told their young charges that they were watching real footage shot by militants who had blown themselves up, and then beamed it down from Paradise. Recruits from abroad are generally not so naive. Americans have long feared that Al-Shabaab's poison-merchants are also at work in U.S. Muslim communities, notably in Minnesota's Twin Cities, home to the largest concentration of Somalis in exile in the United States. Since 2007, at least 20 young Somali-American men are known to have vanished from their homes and re-appeared in their homeland as volunteers for the Islamist cause. At least three of them have died as suicide bombers; and two or three of them might have been among those who attacked the Nairobi Westgate mall in Kenya. Ideologues do exist in America. The Yemeni-American Anwar al-Awlaki, killed by a U.S. drone missile in Yemen in 2011, is perhaps the most prominent example. Awlaki was necessarily a sophisticated orator: Westernized Somalis are unlikely to be seduced by the promise of a piece of fruit. Of far greater influence, however, are online videos of fiery speeches and stirring footage of, for instance, Al-Shabaab's latest and carefully edited successes on the battlefield. The FBI says that the Al-Shabaab recruitment process in Minneapolis has no evil ""mastermind"" as such, but is, as FBI Supervisory Special Agent E.K. Wilson told me in Minneapolis, ""a very lateral, peer-to-peer organization,"" which is another way of saying the recruits tend to talk each other into it. Those who make it to Somalia often do not like what they find. Some of the Minnesota boys sent e-mails home complaining about the heat or the malaria. They missed things like McDonalds and coffee. Burhan Hassan, 17, once a diligent student at Roosevelt High School who was eventually killed in 2009, phoned his mother to say that, while traveling by boat to a Shabaab base somewhere in southern Somalia, he had been so violently sick that his glasses had flown overboard. His mother sweetly fetched his prescription and read it out to him, in the faint hope that he could find an optician to replace them. Some of the gunmen at the Nairobi mall also showed a disarmingly human side. One of them, scolded by 4-year-old British boy Elliott Prior as a ""very bad man,"" replied, ""Please forgive me -- we are not monsters,"" and gave him a Mars Bar. There can be no better illustration of the insane contradictions and conflicted morality of killing innocents in the name of Islam. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of James Fergusson.","James Fergusson: Somali teens lured into Al-Shabaab by promise of food, security .
Many are orphans, he says, with no real Islamic ideology, who want to survive .
Recruiters tell of virgins in heaven, he says; Americans lured by tales of battle .
He says until Somalia gives teens a chance at a decent life, they will turn to Al-Shabaab ."
"Editor's note: upwave is Turner Broadcasting's new lifestyle brand designed to entertain the health into you! Visit upwave.com for more information and follow upwave on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Pinterest and Instagram @upwaveofficial. (upwave.com) -- Even if you're one of the many people who believe that exposing yourself to day-to-day germs is healthy for your immune system, it's still wise to take steps to protect yourself from the most infectious germs in your home. ""Bugs like Escherichia coli (E.coli), salmonella and campylobacter can make you pretty sick or even kill you,"" says Douglas Powell, professor of diagnostic medicine and pathobiology at Kansas State University in Manhattan, Kansas, and author of Barfblog.com. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that seven pathogens cause about 90% of these illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths. Scientists dub them ""food-borne illnesses"" because they're microbes that invade your body through the gastrointestinal tract. (Considering that we put our hands to our faces anywhere from 18 to 40 times per hour, is it any surprise that our mouths are the primary point of entry?) You'll recognize the poisoning by the fever, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea that results. Luckily, it isn't too hard to eliminate the dangerous microbes you may unknowingly drag into your home. ""Chlorine bleach is your friend,"" says Powell, referring to one of the most effective toxin-destroying products around. upwave: Is hand sanitizer toxic? Rooting out the microbes' whereabouts, on the other hand, can be trickier. Read on, and you'll learn how to eliminate from your home the microbes and toxins that could affect your family's health. Good: Rearrange your fridge to reduce your risk . You don't have to travel to Latin America to experience a case of Montezuma's Revenge. Each year, one in six Americans contracts food poisoning right here on U.S. soil, according to the CDC. In fact, a mere trip to your refrigerator could put you at risk. ""The raw meat you bring home from the grocery store has bacteria that can result in diarrheal disease,"" says Dr. Rose Devasia, assistant professor at University of Louisville School of Public Health And Information Sciences in Louisville, Kentucky. A recent report from the Center for Science in the Public Interest listed ground beef, chicken, turkey and steak as the most susceptible to disease. Devasia recommends double-bagging the meats or placing them on the bottom shelf of your refrigerator on a plate, away from the likes of the apples, strawberries or celery you'll eat cold. ""You'll go on to cook your meat to kill these microbes,"" she says, ""but you don't want that slimy liquid from the package to spill onto the fruits and vegetables you eat raw."" upwave: Old-school cleaning with kitchen faves . Better: Place toothbrushes far away from the john . You wouldn't lick your toilet on purpose. Yet leaving a damp, exposed toothbrush within three feet of the loo isn't much better. ""Studies have shown that bacteria in the toilet can disperse in the air after flushing it,"" says Devasia. ""Toilet water -- along with whatever you've deposited in it -- gets aerosolized and lands onto what's nearby, like a toothbrush or hand towel."" A recent University of Manchester study found that the average toothbrush contained about 10 million germs, including E. coli and staphylococci. An easy fix: Put the lid down on the toilet before you yank the lever to dispose of the contents. Adds Devasia: ""We all know the bathroom is not the cleanest place, so wash your hands to avoid getting yourself sick."" Soaping up at the sink can reduce your chance of getting ill by 30%. upwave: Make your morning routine less crazy . Best: Leave your shoes at the front door . Sleeping with the enemy may only be a closet door away. If you walk through your house with your shoes on, you may be dragging in all kinds of nasty germs and chemicals from the great outdoors. The bottoms of your shoes spread many unhealthy agents, from pollen and pesticides on the lawn to salmonella in bird poop. In fact, as many as nine different kinds of pathogens can thrive on shoes, according to a University of Arizona study. Microbes can survive and even multiply because of nutrient-rich soil and other deposits left on the soles. ""In my house, we take our shoes off when we enter,"" says Devasia.

"(CNN) -- Chicago is the third-largest U.S. city, home to nearly 3 million people and the gateway to America's heartland. Like many other cities, it's working hard to combat violent gangs that make it dangerous to grow up in certain neighborhoods. Things may be turning around under Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy: Murders have dropped under his leadership. And he says the city's violent reputation is ""way overblown."" Tackling Chicago's 'crime gap' Still, Chicago struggles to create a safety net for those whose daily lives are affected by the intractable inner-city violence. Politicians, teachers, community activists and other residents are all addressing different facets of this issue in CNN's original series ""Chicagoland."" Here are some of the organizations featured in the CNN series that you can help to make Chicago a safer, stronger city: . 1. Program to keep kids off the streets . Soccer, theater, creative writing, culinary arts -- these are much better alternatives for high school children who might otherwise be on the streets between the time they get out of school and their parents come home from work. These activities are part of a program called After School Matters, set up in 1991 by Maggie Daley, the late wife of former Mayor Richard M. Daley. After School Matters raises money by selling some of the art made by teenagers in the after-school programs: . The program has had an impact on more than 100,000 teens since its inception, according to its website. 2. Stronger schools and students . Chicago's public schools educate more than 400,000 children and, like a lot of school systems across the country, they've had to do it with a lot less money in recent years. If you've seen CNN's ""Chicagoland,"" you know that the city's schools -- particularly Fenger High School, which is featured in the series -- are often the only chance many young people have to create a better future. You can help the school system with as little as $10 through the Children First Fund: The Chicago Public Schools Foundation. To help Fenger specifically, you can donate to Billy Dec and Juanita Jordan's fund-raiser for the school. 3. Theater and music . It's no surprise that Chicago has a thriving arts scene. Yet the world-class museums, theaters and concert halls might as well be a world away for many residents. To change that, several organizations are bringing the arts scene to all of Chicago. Teens in the diverse Albany Park neighborhood can channel their artistic expression onstage at the Albany Park Theater Project. For future singers, the Chicago Children's Choir offers opportunities in 65 schools across the city to ""(empower) singers to bridge cultural divides and become ambassadors of peace in their communities."" And the Chicago Symphony Orchestra's Institute for Learning, Access and Training is helping develop the next generation of musicians across all areas of the city. 4. Back to nature . Organic produce is a rare sight in many of Chicago's poorer neighborhoods, but one organization is not only addressing that problem -- it's employing people in sustainable jobs to cultivate and distribute healthy fruits and vegetables. Chicago's Growing Home organization counted down its achievements for 2013 on its blog, including distributing boxes of organic produce, training and supporting previously unemployed or underemployed Chicagoans, and raising awareness about the importance of a healthy lifestyle. 5. Inspiration for future leaders . President Barack Obama got his political start in Chicago, and there's a good chance that another future American president is learning about civic leadership with the help of organizations such as Mikva Challenge and the Urban Alliance. Mikva Challenge, named after former U.S. Rep. Abner Mikva and his wife, Zoe, a longtime education activist, strives to ""help low-income Chicago youth become meaningful actors in politics."" The organization has trained more than 20,000 young people to learn how to participate in Chicago's political process. It even helped Fenger High School organize a peace march, featured on ""Chicagoland."" The Urban Alliance started an internship program in 2012, helping high school students learn key job skills and develop relationships with major business partners. All interns have graduated on time from Chicago public high schools, and nearly all are attending college. Here are a few other groups helping to make Chicago a better city: . • The Beloved Community Chicago . • Kids Off the Block . • Ounce of Prevention Fund . • Wade's World Foundation . • West Side Health Authority .","Chicago's violent reputation is ""way overblown,"" police superintendent says .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Chinese authorities have killed more than 20,000 birds from a live-poultry trading zone in Shanghai after an unusual strain of bird flu that has so far killed six people in the country was found in pigeons on sale in the city, state-run media outlet Xinhua reported Friday. Details of the slaughter of chickens, ducks, geese and pigeons come as the city prepares to temporarily close all its live poultry markets. It wasn't clear how long the market closures -- announced Friday on the Shanghai Municipal Government's microblog account -- would last. By Friday morning, authorities in Shanghai had already closed the Huhai agricultural market, where the H7N9 avian flu virus had been found in pigeons, Xinhua reported. The virus had not previously been found in humans until a series of cases were reported in China this week. The cull at the Shanghai poultry trading zone came as researchers in the United States said they had started work on developing a vaccine for H7N9. Cambodia sees spike in bird flu deaths . The Chinese Minister of Agriculture said Thursday an analysis showed a strong genetic overlap between the strain found in the Huhai market pigeons and the one detected in infected humans. At the Huhai market, Shanghai authorities were disinfecting the area and objects that came into contact with the birds, Xinhau reported. Officials are trying to track where the infected pigeons came from. A growing number of cases . A 64-year-old man died Thursday night in Huzhou, Zhejiang province, the provincial health bureau said Friday. He died hours after doctors had confirmed he had been infected with the H7N9 virus, it said. He is one of the 14 human cases of H7N9 reported so far -- all of them in the coastal area of eastern China. Authorities there began reporting the first cases on Sunday. Four of the deaths happened in Shanghai, the two others in Zhejiang. The ages of those infected have ranged from a 4-year-old child, who was reported to be recovering, to an 83-year-old man. No cases of human-to-human transmission of the H7N9 virus have been confirmed so far. A person in Shanghai who developed flu symptoms after coming into close contact with a patient who died of the virus tested negative for H7N9, city authorities said. Seeking the cause and a vaccine . ""We don't know yet where the humans got their virus from,"" said Dr. Joseph Bresee, who heads the epidemiology and prevention branch in the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) influenza division. The virus has not been shown to spread easily between humans, he added. The CDC, based in Atlanta, is working closely with Chinese authorities trying to find the source of the human infections, Bresee said. ""There are lots of things happening at CDC to prepare for this virus,"" Bresee said. ""State health departments are readying themselves just in case,"" and researchers are working on developing a vaccine for this strain, he said. Bird flu research resumes -- but not in U.S. Regional concerns . In a sign of broader regional concern about the situation, the Hospital Authority in Hong Kong said it had sent a team of six people, including experts from Hong Kong University and the Center for Health Protection, to Shanghai on Thursday. The team's purpose was to ""learn about the experience of H7N9"" in Shanghai, the authority said, adding that it was due to return late Friday. And Japan's National Institute of Infectious Diseases will receive samples of the virus from Chinese authorities as soon as this month, CNN affiliate NHK reported. The institute is already analyzing genetic information from the virus in order to be ready to quickly produce vaccines, if needed, NHK said. Other strains from the H7 virus family caused previous outbreaks in poultry in countries including the Netherlands, Britain, Canada, the United States and Mexico, Malik Peiris, a professor at Hong Kong University's School of Public Health, said earlier this week. Human infection was documented in all of those cases except the Mexican one. The outbreak of the H7N7 strain in the Netherlands in 2003 infected 89 people, one of whom died, according to Peiris. The better known H5N1 avian flu virus has infected more than 600 people since 2003, of which more than 370 have died, according to the World Health Organization. In February, China reported two new human cases of H5N1 in the southern province of Guizhou, both of whom were in a critical condition, the WHO said. A spike in H5N1 deaths, many of them children, has been reported in Cambodia, prompting concern among health authorities. CNN's Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong. CNN's Feng Ke and Steven Jiang in Beijing, Pamela Boykoff in Hong Kong and Miriam Falco in Atlanta contributed to this report.","NEW: Authorities slaughter market birds in Shanghai after H7N9 found in pigeons .

"(RealSimple.com) -- It's easy to take a lot of vacation pictures; organizing them is something else. Here, how to chronicle your favorite shots for future posterity. Elvis Presley impersonator Tom E. Lynd looks at photos with  tourists in Las Vegas, Nevada in 2005. Edit yourself . The key to scaling down your photo stockpiles: edit, edit, edit. It's all right if every shot is not a winner -- not even the pros bat 1,000 -- but it's not all right to cling to every frame as if it were an Ansel Adams original. Toss or delete poor-quality photos . As soon as you get your pictures back, immediately throw out any shots that are too dark, out of focus, or unflattering (or delete them from your digital camera). Many photo labs allow you to inspect photos before you pay and to chuck any shots that have technical problems, with those prints deducted from the bill. Get rid of dupes . The harder task is to eliminate redundant shots. There you were, at Walt Disney World, when Junior had a close encounter with Mickey Mouse. You were at the ready with the camera and it was all so exciting that you couldn't help yourself -- you shot half a roll. Now you have the pictures back and they all look basically the same: Junior grinning; Junior grinning and waving; Junior grinning and waving with eyes closed; Junior grinning and waving with Mickey's head cut off. Pick just a few that sum up the thrill of the moment. Toss the rest. You still have the negatives, if, at any point, you want to go back and view the moment-by-moment unfolding of the event. Label your images . While your memory is still fresh, it's a good idea to write a note on the back of the photo -- at the bottom edge, and only using a photo-safe, nonacidic pen, such as a Sharpie -- about where the picture was taken and what people were doing or saying at the time. ""Maybe you have a picture of Aunt Mary and Uncle Harry, and it was on this trip that Uncle Harry dropped the cake,"" says Ronni Eisenberg, author of ""Organize Your Home!: Simple Routines for Managing Your Household.""  ""Write that on the photo, because otherwise in 10 years you won't remember the story, and pictures are the story of your life."" File your vacation photos in boxes . The simplest containment policy for pictures that have made it through the first cut is putting them into special photo cartons about the size of shoe boxes, only a little sturdier. Most of these come with envelopes for storing negatives and photos; or at the very least, you can leave them in the envelopes they come in from the lab. Always write the date and the event on the outside of the envelope, for quick retrieval. Most boxes come with dividers and tabs for all the pertinent information. If you're going tab-less, Eisenberg suggests numbering the envelopes as you put them in, so that if you need to take one out you know exactly where to put it back. These boxes, which normally store 1,000 photos, come dressed up in leather or with wrapping-paper-pretty designs so they don't look shoddy. Preserve your photos with proper storage . If you want photos to last, make sure to store them correctly. Extreme temperatures and humidity can dramatically shorten the life span of your photos. ""A good rule of thumb is if you're comfortable, your photos are comfortable,"" says Daniel Burge, an assistant scientist at the Image Permanence Institute at the Rochester Institute of Technology. That means forget about stashing them in the attic, basement, or garage. Burge also cautions against storing photos near the kitchen or bathroom, where humidity is high, or in closets that back up to pipes, which could leak. Put your vacation photos in albums . Now that your photos are tucked away in their boxes, you can pull only your favorites, maybe 10 or 20, to put in a mini-album for easy and repeated viewings. Consider making an album devoted only to one trip, using books slightly larger than the photos themselves; this will keep the project more manageable, and mini-albums are more portable for those eat-your-heart-out showings at the office. Sketchbooks with ring bindings, available at art-supply stores, make ideal mini-albums. Simply paste photos down with an acid-free glue stick and then remove any pages you haven't filled. Store and share your images online . The Internet makes it even easier to share photos. You don't need to have a digital camera to take part in the electronic exchange or be techno-literate. Many laboratories will scan your conventional photographs onto a CD-ROM, so that you can download images on your computer and send them via e-mail or post them on a Web site. When you get your Kodak film processed, in addition to conventional photographs, you can request a picture CD, which allows you to touch up (goodbye red eye) and crop pictures on your computer or to make a ""slide show"" presentation of the entire roll (it's a more advanced way to bore friends than with your parents' carousels of vacation slides). Or at the lab, request that Kodak put the pictures directly online at www.picturecenter.kodak.com, where friends can view the shots and even order prints directly, preventing you from getting stuck with the dreary errand and the expense.

"Washington (CNN) -- The seasoned Democratic operative President Barack Obama tapped last week to head his administration's Ebola fight got to work on Wednesday, though Ron Klain's new job is expected to unfold out of public sight. The so-called ""Ebola czar"" -- termed an ""Ebola Response Coordinator"" by the White House -- will meet with Obama and other top advisers Wednesday afternoon in the Oval Office to discuss the global crisis, which has Americans worried about their own safety and skeptical of the government's ability to respond. Klain's appointment last week was meant partly to quell public anxiety about the virus. The announcement came after calls from lawmakers to name a central organizing ""czar"" that could ensure the various health arms of the administration were working in concert. Obama initially resisted, saying his top homeland security aide Lisa Monaco was doing a sufficient job in managing the response alongside her other tasks, which include a major role advising the mission against ISIS. But on Thursday -- the same day lawmakers slammed the administration's Ebola response during a Capitol Hill hearing -- the president conceded he may need someone to manage the effort fulltime. He named Klain to the role Friday, though the White House said it took until this week to complete the required paperwork to get him started. He was spotted at the White House on Saturday evening, though he didn't attend a high-level Oval Office meeting on Ebola that took place around the same time. Klain's appointment was met with suspicion from Republicans, who pointed out the former lobbyist and vice presidential chief of staff lacked any medical experience. But White House officials say Klain was picked because of his knowledge of the vast federal bureaucracy and his ability to pull the strings of government. ""What we were looking for is not an Ebola expert, but rather an implementation expert,"" Press Secretary Josh Earnest said last week. The White House says Klain won't be his own boss; he'll report both to Monaco and National Security Adviser Susan Rice. And the White House made clear last week Obama himself bears ultimate oversight for his administration's actions. As such, aides say Klain's new job coordinating various federal agencies won't be public-facing, though they haven't ruled out putting him in front of cameras to address the government efforts.

"(CNN) -- One of the most debilitating medical conditions in sub-Saharan Africa isn't fatal. In fact, it's easily curable. The culprit is small, but its impact is big. The chigoe flea, more commonly known as a jigger, typically burrows itself into the feet and hands. It prevents millions of children from attending school, stops farmers from working their land, and makes walking all but unbearable. Kenyan businessman Stanley Kamau had jiggers as a kid, and he remembers how he was stigmatized by his classmates, for in his school, the parasite singled you out as poor. ""I almost dropped out of primary school because of the effects, because I could not stand the way my classmates laughed at me and used to harass me. They would step on me, and I didn't have shoes,"" he recalls. Luckily, Kamau's family owned cattle, and had a cattle dip -- a bath filled with insecticide -- which they used to treat the cows. Kamau cured himself by dipping his hands and feet in the water. He was able to continue his studies, and went on to attend university in India. After successfully launching a number of businesses, Kamau returned to his home village in Murang'a, where he decided to give back to his community. At first, he simply donated food and clothes, but soon he realized the adverse effect jiggers was having on his fellow villagers. ""I was shocked when I visited some of the homes and saw that some kids had never gone to school, that men and women weren't going to their farms. They were disabled because of the jigger menace."" Kamau set up the Ahadi Kenya Trust, which treats victims of jiggers throughout Kenya. Originally, the trust signed up four families. Today, 2.6 million Kenyans are registered with the group. The banana solution . Kamau saw how jiggers entrenches families deeper into poverty. As a solution, he set up a banana farm on a stretch of land donated by his aunt. Jigger survivors can join the farm, and are given free materials, from seeds to fertilizer, to enrich their land back home. ""Every member has to duplicate what we are doing on their own particular farm,"" he says. ""We provide them with seedlings to plant in the communal farm, and give them seedlings to plant in their own individual farm... it's like a learning center where every member of the community can learn more on how to do bananas."" Kamau has expanded the entrepreneurial side of his trust to include chicken and rabbit farming, as well as bee keeping. The rural ambulance . In his attempt to eradicate jiggers from his home country, Kamau realized how difficult it can be for many living in rural communities to seek medical attention. He heard stories of people brought to hospitals in sacks and wheelbarrows. He even heard about a boy who broke his back in a motorcycle accident while he was being transported to a medical facility for a fractured arm. ""The fact is, most people who live at the bottom of poverty don't have mobile phones, they don't have radios or TV sets, they have no channel of communication. They might not even know what kind of a dispensary or hospital is near them,"" he notes. It was then that he developed the ambulance Mashinani -- or village ambulance. It's basically a detachable bed -- complete with a medical and maternity kit -- that hooks onto a motorbike. ""You can have a hospital, but are people able to visit? Are they able to walk? Are they able to call? Are they able to even have information on those types of facilities? Let's not have a very beautiful hospital where people are not able to get access.""","Jiggers is a debilitating foot parasite .

"(CNN) -- Nit infestations, beer instead of water, a band for entertainment -- life on the Mary Rose, the flagship of King Henry VIII's fleet, which sank during battle in July 1545, wasn't all about crashing cannon fire and men being swept overboard, as novels and Hollywood like to depict. The 16th-century warship sank on July 19, 1545, in the English Channel during a battle with the French. Now, nearly 500 years later and 31 years after it was raised from the bottom of the English Channel, the ship will go on show in a museum in the same British dockyard where it was built. Some 60 million people watched the Mary Rose emerge from the water on live television in 1982. Today the secrets of life onboard can be seen in a new £27 million ($40 million) museum in Portsmouth Historic Dockyard. Other costs incurred in the salvage and conservation of the fragile ship take the total expenditure past £35 million. The remains of the hull are displayed on one side, while hundreds of the objects found onboard are displayed opposite, organized by deck. The museum tells the story of life onboard a 16th-century warship and is dedicated to the approximately 400 men who lost their lives on the ship. The Mary Rose Museum opens on May 31. Tickets are available from www.historicdockyard.co.uk and cost £17 ($26). An all-attraction ticket that also includes entry to the dockyard's other attractions is £26.","The Mary Rose sank July 19, 1545, in the English Channel during a battle with the French .

"(CNN) -- The surviving suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings has cited the U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq as motivating factors behind last week's attack, a U.S. government official said Tuesday. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has been able to communicate with investigators in a limited fashion from his hospital bed and told them that neither he nor his brother Tamerlan, now dead, had any contact with terrorist groups overseas. The official cautioned that the interviews were preliminary, however, and that Tsarnaev's account needs to be checked out. The 19-year-old has told investigators the brothers were self-radicalized via the Internet. Investigators also are looking into whether the online English-language magazine Inspire, put out by Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, was used for instruction on how to make the bombs, but another source cautioned that other outlets could have provided that information. The twin blasts just before the finish line of the April 15 race killed three people and wounded more than 260 and turned a chunk of downtown Boston into a crime scene, disrupting the normal routines of countless others. Authorities slowly began allowing residents and business owners back into the area Tuesday. There was no word on when the street where the bombings occurred will be fully open to the public. That, the city says, will depend on how quickly building owners can make repairs and other issues. Business owner Ed Borash was among those who returned Tuesday. He said he and his son narrowly missed injury in the bombing. ""I've had a tough time,"" he said. ""It's just one of those things. It's very emotional."" Helena Collins, a businesswoman in the area, said it was important to get up and running again, but not just for economic reasons. ""For us and our business, it's really about how do we get back to Boston, how do we band together, how do we help those that were seriously injured that are going to have lifelong struggles,"" she said. As of Tuesday evening, 43 people injured in last week's attack remained hospitalized, one of whom is in critical condition, according to a CNN tally. Meanwhile, two victims of the bombing were laid to rest. Family members of 8-year-old Martin Richard held a private funeral Mass Tuesday, his parents said in a statement. A public memorial service is planned, they said. ""The outpouring of love and support over the last week has been tremendous,"" Denise and Bill Richard said in the statement. ""We laid our son Martin to rest, and he is now at peace."" Family, friends and colleagues mourned slain Massachusetts Institute of Technology police Officer Sean Collier at a private memorial service in Stoneham, Massachusetts, CNN affiliate WHDH reported. A memorial service open to law enforcement officers and the MIT community is scheduled for Wednesday on MIT's campus, the university said. New details on officer's slaying . Collier was killed Thursday night, near the beginning of a wild 24 hours that culminated in Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's capture in the backyard of a home in Watertown, a Boston suburb. Authorities suspect Tsarnaev and his 26-year-old brother of killing the officer, though Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has not been charged in Collier's death. According to a source with direct knowledge of the investigation, Collier didn't even have time to activate his emergency alert before being shot four or five times in the chest and head as he sat in his patrol car on the MIT campus. It's not clear why the brothers allegedly ambushed the officer, the source said. The source said investigators believe the Tsarnaevs then carjacked a black SUV, took the driver hostage and drove past the scene of the shooting before going to a gas station. Carjacking victim tells his story . Investigators believe Tamerlan Tsarnaev carried out the car jacking while his younger brother was nearby at the time, a U.S. official told CNN Tuesday. In an exclusive interview with CNN affiliate WMUR, a man identifying himself as the carjacking victim said he was worried for his life. ""They asked me where I'm from. I told them I'm Chinese,"" WMUR quoted the man as saying. ""I was very scared. I asked them if they were going to hurt me. They said they won't hurt me. I was thinking, 'I think they will kill me later.' "" The man escaped when the brothers stopped to fill up the gas tank, running for his life as one of the brothers swore at him, WMUR reported. Soon after, the brothers encountered police, setting off a furious gun battle in which authorities say they fired handguns and hurled explosives at pursuing officers before Tamerlan Tsarnaev was shot. As the younger brother fled in the vehicle, he apparently ran over Tamerlan, authorities said. See first photos of the takedown . Suspect shopped at fireworks store . More than two months before the marathon bombings, Tamerlan Tsarnaev bought two reloadable mortar style fireworks a New Hampshire store. On February 6, Tsarnaev had one question for a store assistant at Phantom Fireworks in Seabrook, New Hampshire: ""What's the biggest and loudest thing you have?"" After that, store Vice President William Weimer said, Tsarnaev shelled out $200 cash for two ""lock and load kits."" Weimer said such behavior is very common in the store. He said the store notified the FBI after discovering that the marathon bombing suspect had bought explosives there. Law enforcement officials told CNN earlier Tuesday that the number of fireworks bought at the store was not enough to set off explosions the size of those at the Boston Marathon. ""My assumption is they bought this, experimented with it and decided against it and moved on and found another source,"" Weimer said. Details emerge about boat, standoff . Tamerlan Tsarnaev was pronounced dead early Friday. On Friday night, police captured Dzhokhar Tsarnaev hiding inside a boat in a backyard. Boat owner David Henneberry told CNN affiliate WCVB Tuesday that his obsession with how his boat was stored just right led him to discover the suspect as he stood on a ladder replacing two pads that had fallen out of the shrink wrap protecting his boat for the winter. ""I got three steps up the ladder and rolled the shrink wrap. I didn't expect to see anything, but I saw blood on the floor of the boat. A good amount of blood. ... And I looked back and forth a couple of times and my eyes went to the engine block and there was a body,"" he told the affiliate. Henneberry said Tuesday that he doesn't even remember climbing down the ladder and running to the phone to dial 911, delivering the tip that would lead to Tsarnaev's capture. ""I didn't waste any time. I didn't ask him if he wanted a cup of coffee. I was off that ladder. That is all I remember,"" he told the affiliate. Investigators swarmed the scene, forming a perimeter. Multiple shots rang out from behind the house, Boston Police Superintendent William Evans said Tuesday. Authorities are still investigating whether Tsarnaev was armed and whether a shootout occurred at the boat, Evans told reporters. ""Clearly from everybody's vantage point, we could see whoever was in that boat was poking at that top,"" he said. It wasn't clear at the time, he said, whether the suspect had a handgun or was trying to poke a hole in the boat's cover. After a standoff, hostage negotiators persuaded him to surrender, Evans said. Investigation continues . The Tsarnaev family is from the Russian republic of Chechnya and fled the brutal wars there in the 1990s. The two brothers were born in Kyrgyzstan; Dzhokhar became a U.S. citizen in 2012. His brother was a legal U.S. resident. Although Tamerlan Tsarnaev had become increasingly radical in the past three or four years, there was no evidence Tuesday of any accomplices or connections to extremists, a U.S. official said. But Dzhokhar Tsarnaev conveyed to authorities that his brother believed Islam is under attack and its adherents must fight back, a U.S. government source said Monday. Communicating with investigators by writing and nodding, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has indicated that his older brother masterminded the bombings, the source said. The younger Tsarnaev has been charged with using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction resulting in death, as well as one count of malicious destruction of property by means of an explosive device resulting in death. The U.S. official said Tuesday that investigators have determined that the pressure cookers used in the attacks were purchased at a Macy's department store. Read a transcript of the hearing .

In a statement issued through their lawyers Tuesday, the suspects' sisters -- Ailina and Bella Tsarnaev -- said they were saddened ""to see so many innocent people hurt after such a callous act."" ""As a family, we are absolutely devastated by the sense of loss and sorrow this has caused,"" they said. ""We don't have any answers but we look forward to a thorough investigation and hope to learn more."" And Tamerlan Tsarnaev's wife, Katherine Russell, issued a statement through her attorney's office saying she is ""doing everything she can to assist with the investigation"" and said she and her family are shocked and distraught. ""The reports of involvement by her husband and brother-in-law came as an absolute shock to them all,"" the statement said. Dead suspect's wife 'very distraught' The suspects' mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaev, said Tuesday that she believed her sons had been framed. Speaking from her home in Dagestan -- a Russian republic on the Caspian Sea -- Tsarnaev said she thinks her older son died because he was a Muslim and charged that authorities silenced her younger son to prevent him from defending himself. She said family members have arranged for Tamerlan Tsarnaev to be buried at a mosque in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Tuesday or Wednesday. An official with the Islamic Society of Boston said it has not received any funeral requests from the family. A spokesman for the chief medical examiner's office also said officials there have heard nothing about plans by the slain suspect's family to claim his body.

"(CNN) -- Rio Ferdinand was one of the world's top defenders -- now he's turned his hand to defending the reputation of his former manager Alex Ferguson. The Scot, one of British football's most successful leaders, has been criticized in recent months following Manchester United's dramatic downturn in form since his departure. Over two decades, Ferguson won 13 Premier League titles, two Champions League crowns, five FA Cups and four League Cups. But after leading United to league glory in 2013, a title won by 11 points, Ferguson retired and appeared to take his magic touch with him. Under David Moyes, United capitulated in alarming fashion, finishing seventh and failing to qualify for European competition. However, some argued Ferguson had left his successor an aging squad, with the likes of Ferdinand, now 35, Nemanja Vidic, Patrice Evra -- two defenders who left Old Trafford in the summer transfer window -- Robin van Persie and Michael Carrick all in their fourth decade. ""I don't understand how people can say that,"" Ferdinand, who left Old Trafford at the end of last season, told CNN when asked whether Ferguson was responsible for United's failings. ""You've got some great players throughout the squad. You win the league by 11 points. You've got to be a top team to do that. ""So he goes and then it all falls apart. So that's his fault? How can people say that?"" Ferdinand, who won 81 caps for England, arrived from Leeds United in July 2002 for £30m, a world record for a defender at that time, went on to win six Premier League titles, the Champions League and two League Cups. Now at Queens Park Rangers, Ferdinand was part of the United team which struggled badly last season under Moyes, the man who was handpicked by Ferguson to succeed him. Moyes was relieved of his duties after just 10 months in charge and was replaced at the start of the 2014 season by Dutch coach Louis van Gaal. Van Gaal has already made his mark by bringing in a number of high-profile players including Angel Di Maria from Real Madrid for a British transfer record fee of $98.7 million, Colombia striker Radamel Falcao on loan from Monaco and Dutch star Daley Blind. Results have been mixed so far with United losing to the likes of Swansea and Leicester City, as well as being humiliated by third-tier side Milton Keynes Dons in the League Cup. Two consecutive home wins over Queens Park Rangers and West Ham have lifted United to seventh in the Premier League table ahead of Sunday's clash with Everton at Old Trafford. With Van Gaal struggling for defensive options and Ander Herrera, the midfielder, absent with a rib injury, United will once again by forced to field a changed line-up. Ferdinand, who won six league titles with United, says the new manager needs time to ensure his new signings gel and come together. ""It's just about the new managers coming in and making that work together still,"" he added. ""Do they want wholesale changes? This manager seems like he wants to do that now. He's changing, making big changes. He's bought a lot of players in. ""So I don't think the buck stops with Alex Ferguson at all. I think you leave and you win a trophy. ""There's not many better ways to go out than that.""","Rio Ferdinand launches staunch defense of Alex Ferguson .

"Seattle, Washington (CNN) -- The dinner crowd trickles in slowly at first, some taking time to play a little pool in a recreation area, others just wait patiently in line, or find a spot to sit and strike up a conversation. On the street, Orion Center has a reputation for its pleasant and welcoming staff, and, as Kayla Wyatt puts it, a place to get a good ""feed."" And of late, there are many new faces among the familiar. At a restaurant, that's a sign of progress. At a support organization for the young homeless -- like Orion Center -- it is a troubling sign of the times. More troubling is to take an up-close look at Seattle's streets and parks after Orion Center shuts down for the day, especially as temperatures drop and the combination of rain and gusty winds makes for bone-chilling conditions. ""Last year we had 2,057 young people,"" said Melinda Giovengo, the executive director of YouthCare, the organization that oversees Orion Center. ""This year we are on target to serve over 3,300. So literally a 50 percent increase in the demand for services."" Increased demand, but reduced resources -- a painful double whammy of a sour economy: 10.2 percent unemployment nationally, 9.3 percent in Washington state's latest figures. ""We've had family foundations who have been supportive of us for 20 year saying we can't this year,"" Giovengo said in discussion of how the bad economy hurts YouthCare's bottom line. ""We've lost a lot of corporate sponsors this year."" The result is an urgent need to do more with less. Those coming for help range from 14 to 22. Every now and then, someone younger wanders in with a group. ""When the economy crashes, what we saw are the families that are barely hanging on, barely able to deal with the stress they were facing every day, people who were kind of on the lowest tiers of the economy -- their families fell apart,"" Giovengo told us during an afternoon and evening visit to Orion Center. ""They collapse under the stress of financial woes,"" she said. ""Dad may be home too much, people may start drinking too much, and just the day to day stress of living with a young person or adolescent -- and all of a sudden, young people are on the street. We've had people come in and say, 'I'm here. I am 18 years old. My family can't afford me anymore.' "" Kayla considers herself an Orion Center success story. She left home because of ""a little bit of family problems due to my youth and rebellion, and so I just wanted to experience life. You get hungry after a while, so you need to come somewhere to eat."" Her first visits to Orion House were just for ""the feed,"" but then, after living on the street ""on and off for about two years,"" Kayla remembers: ""I just kind of woke up one day and decided that I'd had enough, like I wasn't happy -- like I thought I was happy."" Through Orion House Center, she worked on her GED, and then joined one of the vocational training programs -- this one for baristas for local cafes and coffee shops. It is an 8-week program, and Kayla is now job-hunting while working on longer term goals. ""I want to do social work, go to college for that,"" she said. ""And maybe go to college to get my own business and open my own café."" And, importantly, she is back living at home with her mother while looking for work and planning to get her own apartment. ""I just felt at the time, I could do it by myself and I didn't need any help,"" Kayla told us. ""But now I know I was naïve."" Giovengo measures Orion Center's success in different ways. One is by the numbers: . ""Over 12,000 meals a year, 10,000 showers. And believe it or not 10,000 pairs of socks to keep those peoples' feet warm."" Another is by the improved esteem -- and job prospects -- of many of those who first entered the facility just to get a hot meal or a few hours shelter from the rain. Michal and DeLaun are from very different backgrounds, but became friends as classmates in an Orion Center technology class. Michal, now 21, left home in Ohio three years ago and came to Seattle to be with a man he met over the Internet. ""I was just, you know, coming out as queer, and I wanted some time on my own to get things sorted out for myself, and work up the courage to actually tell them."" But the relationship didn't work out, and ""I was hideously ill-prepared when my roommate decided to kick me out. And then I was homeless for about two months."" DeLaun is a Seattle-area native who was reluctant to discuss his family circumstances, except to say he sometimes stayed at his grandmother's but, ""I'm not supposed to be there."" He described himself as homeless and on the street ""about a month or two,"" but mostly bouncing around among friends. At Orion Center, both took a course in computer diagnostics. Finding a job is difficult at the moment; DeLaun is working as an intern at Orion House, and Michal took a job at a local bowling alley. But both are optimistic they will be able to benefit from their new training once the economy recovers. ""I came here kind of lost,"" DeLaun said. ""And I found myself, a whole lot more than I intended to here."" Michal said at job interviews, ""I show up wearing a suit and tie just like everybody else and I basically just present myself as best I can and try to appear, for lack of a better word, normal."" Asked if he considered himself something other than normal, Michal said his experience without a doubt gives him a different perspective. ""I've been cold,"" he said. ""I've been hungry. I've been soaked to the skin and tired and sick and injured. And you definitely learn quite a bit about yourself from that.""","More young people using center but resources are drying up .

"(CNN) -- Thousands of Chileans may have to sleep in the streets Wednesday night after a 7.7 magnitude earthquake rattled the north part of the country, killing at least two people, injuring dozens and destroying hundreds of homes. Valentina Bustos shot this photo Wednesday  of earthquake damage at a hotel in Antofagasta, Chile. ""There are more than a thousand, 1,200 houses, at least, that were totally flattened, and others in bad shape,"" Tocopilla Mayor Luis Moyano said in an interview that aired on Radio Cooperativo. Tocopilla, Chile, north of Santiago, is about 35 km (21 miles) from the quake's epicenter. ""Tonight, people are going to have to sleep in the street, because there are a great number of houses that are uninhabitable,"" said Moyano. Places that could be used as shelters, such as schools and gyms, were  damaged in the quake, the mayor said. Moyano put the number of people without shelter at 4,000. Tocopilla's population is 24,000. Moyano described going through the damaged city and running into people asking, ""Mayor, my house collapsed. What do I do? Mayor, I don't have water. What do I do?"" ""It gets to you,"" he said. Paula Saez with the aid organization World Vision told CNN she was on a treacherous drive attempting to reach Tocopilla. ""There's no electricity and there's a lot of landslides"" covering the road in spots, she said, and the highway was spotted with holes. Once in Tocopilla, Saez said, she was prepared to offer tents, blankets and medicine to citizens and assess additional needs. The government's Office of National Emergency reported that two women had died and others were injured in the city. Officials identified one of those killed as 54-year-old Olga Petronila Ortiz Cisternas. The other fatality was an 88-year-old woman.  Watch what a 7.7 earthquake can do » . Municipal official Ljubica Ukurtovic, in an interview with Chilean TV station TVN, said that ""approximately 100 people"" had sought treatment at a Tocopilla hospital. The quake collapsed a roadway tunnel, temporarily trapping about 50 construction workers.  See where the quake struck » . High-level government sources said the workers had been rescued. Repair work on the 793-meter (2,600-foot) Pedro Galleguillos tunnel, completed in 1994, began on October 1 and was to be finished early next year. Tocopilla is about 1,245 km (780 miles) north of Santiago and the quake was felt in Peru and Bolivia, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The temblor was centered at a depth of 60 km (37 miles), the USGS said. A tsunami warning was issued for the South Pacific coast after the quake hit, but was canceled within an hour. Chile has been the scene of hundreds of strong earthquakes throughout history, including the largest one of the 20th century on May 22, 1960. The quake that struck southern Chile that day registered a magnitude 9.5 and launched a tsunami that caused damage as far away as Hawaii, Japan and the Philippines. Nearly 6,000 people died as a result of the quake and its tsunami. A magnitude 7.8 earthquake that struck southern Chile on January 25, 1939, killed 28,000 people. A magnitude 9.0 earthquake in what was then southern Peru but is now northern Chile killed 25,000 people in 1868.

"London (CNN) -- Abbey Road Studios in London. This is where The Beatles produced some of their classic records. It's a long way from the Cape Town townships where Pumeza Matshikiza grew up, but this is where the South African soprano is recording her debut album. At the studio rehearsals, she is going over the notes again with her producer. Her plush and dark-hued voice has enabled her to enter the world of music, travel and hard work, and leave poverty and hardship behind. ""Cape Town was very hard because it was during Apartheid with black South Africans put in a very awkward position and discriminated against,"" Matshikiza says, reflecting on her childhood. ""My mother was always looking for a job, sometimes I spent time without her. At some point I stayed with my uncles, my aunt, my grandmother, my two cousins in an informal settlement."" Read more: Charlize Theron crusades against AIDS . Matshikiza is one of the newest signings on London based label Decca, which has recorded with opera stars like Luciano Pavarotti and Joan Sutherland. She left South Africa in 2004 and wants to explain her unlikely journey from townships to opera houses with her album, by fusing elements of traditional South African folk songs with popular opera arias by Mozart and Puccini. Some tracks will be accompanied by The African Children's Choir. ""I have in me the African heritage and I've studied classical music, so it's quite interesting that my debut album will have all the different textures of my musical heritage,"" she says. The 34-year-old soprano discovered her voice and her love for music early on. She started singing at church and in school choirs. But then, as a teenager, she discovered opera on the radio. ""I felt a connection with opera. I heard (it) randomly on the radio before it was introduced to us in choirs or before I even went and studied music,"" she explains. ""And when I heard this it was really incredible, the smoothness of the voice, the orchestra -- everything just was beautiful and I fell in love with it."" She currently has a three-year contract with Germany's Stuttgart State Opera -- one of Europe's foremost opera houses -- and has performed at London's Royal Opera House. It's a life that would have seemed like a fairy tale when she was growing up. But whilst first studying to become a surveyor, Matshikiza soon realized she had to follow her passion. ""I would go up to the lower campus and hear people singing, some playing the piano and other instruments and I thought, 'this is where I would love to be,'"" she recalls. ""I took one year off just to think about what I wanted to do then I went to register myself at the college of music."" A decision that would change her life. She auditioned for the South African College of Music and was discovered by the composer Kevin Volans. Impressed by her voice, he funded her ticket to London so she could audition for the Royal College of Music. After hearing her sing, they offered her a full scholarship. ""I was filled with excitement. Excitement of living in London, excitement of studying and absorbing as much as I was going to,"" Matshikiza says.

I used to miss it quite a lot when I left but now it's getting less and less so because whenever I go back everyone is still there, the place is not going to go anywhere,"" she says. Back at Abbey Road Studios Matshikiza is rehearsing the carefully chosen South African songs that will go on her album. ""This music has never been sung in an operatic way with an orchestra, so you want to get the balance very well -- not to sound too operatic but not also to retain the African quality of the music,"" Matshikiza explains. ""Which is also yourself, how you think about the music and find which keys are correct."" One piece she is particularly inspired by is a poem made famous by Nelson Mandela -- ""Invictus,"" by William Ernest Henley. ""It's a beautiful poem and it fits everyone who's gone through a bad patch -- it gives hope,"" she says. ""Nelson Mandela is the hero of the world really. He's done what he could do and people who come after him need to do more. Probably he's the beginning of good things in South Africa. And so I thought (the poem) would really fit."" The lyric soprano belongs to a new generation of emerging opera talents coming from South Africa. They are approaching a Western classical art form from a different perspective, inhaling the old, exhaling the new. ""I hope that I find good roles or good work that suits me and stick with that but also I would like to be involved with certain projects which I'm thinking about for later,"" Matshikiza says. ""So at this moment I'm taking time to develop myself more. And when I have all the knowledge that I can pass to other people, I can do that.""","Soprano Pumeza Matshikiza grew up in the townships of Cape Town, South Africa.

"Washington (CNN) -- When Sarah Palin got a surprise phone call from the McCain campaign one August afternoon, asking whether she'd like to be on the Republican presidential ticket, the then-Alaska governor didn't doubt for a moment she was ready for the challenge. ""When I got the call, it was not such a shocking call to me,"" Palin told talk-show host Oprah Winfrey in a highly anticipated interview that aired Monday. ""I felt quite confident in my abilities and my executive experience and I knew that this is an executive administrative job. I was happy to get in there and contribute."" Nor was Palin deterred by the fact she had five kids at home, including an infant with special needs. ""It never occurred to me that I couldn't do the job because of children,"" she said. ""My children are my strength. ... They allow me to be grounded."" But what did shock Palin was just how much the campaign knew about her and her family before she even formally met with Sen. John McCain to discuss the job. Contrary to what was reported in the media, Palin said, she was extensively vetted, and the campaign knew exactly ""who they were getting."" ""After this vetting and the hours of discussion about the background, my record, my family, what I stand for ... I thought after all that I better confess it now, the one skeleton is in my closet,"" Palin said. ""I did get a D 22 years ago in a college course. And I thought that was going to be the extent of the controversy in Sarah Palin's life."" One year later, Palin has seen more than her fair share of controversies but has emerged as one of the hottest Republican stars and is among the early leaders for the 2012 presidential nomination. Her session with Oprah came a day before her already-bestseller ""Going Rogue: An American Life"" will hit bookstores and Palin will hit the road on a tour of some of America's most conservative corners. The book and concurrent publicity blitz have all the trappings of an early salvo in the upcoming race for the White House, but Palin said 2012 isn't on her radar screen. ""I am dealing with so many issues that are important ... and what I am finding, clearer and clearer every day, what I am seeing is that you don't need a title to make a difference."" In the wide-ranging interview, few subject were left untouched, including Palin's early and frequent clashes with the senior ranks of the McCain campaign. In what was her initial introduction to the high stakes of presidential campaigning, Palin was blindsided by the fact that McCain aides knew that her then-17-year-old daughter Bristol was pregnant, a fact that Palin had yet to disclose back in Alaska. ""I was surprised that they knew. I was surprised, too, that we didn't handle that issue, that challenge better,"" she said. ""If we were given the allowance to deal with the issue in a more productive way, we could have perhaps sent a better message: This is not to be emulated."" She added, ""I did not want that message sent out that we were giddy happy to become grandparents, and that's what that message said."" For the newly minted vice presidential candidate, that was the first sign that she was in for a rocky road with McCain's campaign advisers. ""I rewrote it, and couple hours later it scrolled across the screen. ... There it is, the message I didn't want sent. Just a little indication about problems to come about what I would be able to say and how I would be able to speak, or not speak, my heart and my values."" The handling of her daughter's pregnancy was only the first of a string of frustrations for Palin over the course of the campaign, during which, she said, she and her family felt like they couldn't be themselves. Palin said nowhere was this made more clear than when McCain advisers forced the family to completely overhaul their wardrobe when they touched down in Minneapolis, Minnesota, for the Republican National convention in early September 2008. ""I though this was like one of those relationships you have, when you're young, and somebody says, 'I just love you the way that you are; now let me change you,' "" she said. Another frustration was the campaign's insistence that she grant repeated interviews to CBS anchor Katie Couric, after it was exceedingly clear that they were not going well. ""After the first segment, which didn't go well, I didn't do very well -- I was annoyed with her badgering of questions -- I was scheduled to do a second, then a third and then a fourth. ... I know that there were hours of tape that were shot, and I would think that those few minutes that were edited together ... and shown to the American public, if people only know me from that interview, [they would think] that I was not qualified,"" she said. But the ultimate showdown with McCain aides came on election night, Palin said, when she was prevented from delivering a concession speech before McCain took the stage. ""I was disappointed that the explanation I was given that ... VP candidates never give a speech on election night. That was false because I have seen it happen. In fact four years prior, of course, that had happened."" Ultimately, however, Palin said she thinks that even if she had been allowed to be more herself on the campaign trail, it is likely the GOP presidential ticket would have lost. ""The reason that we lost: The economy changed under a Republican administration,"" Palin said. ""People were sincerely looking for change. They were quite concerned about the road that America was on with its economy. They did not want more of the same. They did not want status quo. And I think, unfortunately, our ticket represented what was perceived as status quo."" But since the campaign came to end one year ago -- and with it McCain advisers' influence over Palin -- she has become more controversial, especially after she abruptly resigned as Alaska's governor over the summer. ""I resigned as governor of Alaska because I wasn't going to run for a second term, and I was heading into a lame duck term,"" Palin said of that decision, which shocked political observers. ""We came back [from the campaign] to a new normal in Alaska. Everything had so changed in my administration,"" Palin continued. ""There were so many opposition researchers up there in Alaska that were sent, probably, by the Obama camp. ... It was a point where my state of Alaska was being hampered by my presence there."" Ultimately though, Palin made clear the move wasn't so much an end as it was a beginning. ""My dad's quote sums it up better than I sum it up,"" she said. "" 'She's not retreating; she's reloading.' "" CNN's Mike Roselli contributed to this report.","Palin says she thought a bad grade years ago would be extent of controversy .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- U.S. authorities have ratcheted up pressure on one of Mexico's most notorious drug cartels, releasing new details about the so-called Gulf Cartel's operations and offering up to a $50 million reward for the arrest of its leaders. These are weapons that the Mexican army said it seized from the ruthless Gulf Cartel in 2008. A federal indictment unsealed Monday charged Miguel Trevino Morales, a leader of the northern Mexico-based Gulf Cartel, of operating a criminal enterprise, cocaine distribution and firearms violations. Concurrently, prosecutors updated a separate indictment against three other top leaders of the Gulf Cartel: Antonio Cardenas Guillen, Jorge Eduardo Costilla and Heriberto Lazcano, for drug trafficking related crimes, all believed to be at large in Mexico. Fifteen other suspected cartel members are also named in that indictment. ""We have learned that the most effective way to disrupt and dismantle criminal organizations is to prosecute their leaders and seize their funding,"" Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer said in a statement. To that end, the departments of justice, state and treasury are working together to place pressure on the Gulf Cartel and what authorities describe as its ruthless enforcement arm, known as Los Zetas. The Department of the Treasury designated the four top bosses named in the indictments as Specially Designated Narcotics Traffickers, which authorizes the freezing of any assets they hold in the United States and other sanctions. The Gulf Cartel and Zetas, nicknamed collectively as ""The Company,"" are among the major drug cartels that are behind the drug-related violence that has swept Mexico in recent years, according to authorities. Since taking office in 2006, Mexican President Felipe Calderon has made fighting the cartels a major priority. The group also operates in cities across the United States, authorities said. The court documents detail telephone conversations between the four leaders and more than a dozen other cartel members allegedly discussing the transportation and smuggling of cocaine and marijuana into the United States. ""These indictments allege a stunning and sophisticated operation by 'The Company' to move illegal drugs into our communities and cash back to Mexico,"" Breuer said. The State Department is offering a rewards totaling up to $50 million for information leading to the capture of four top leaders and six other cartel lieutenants.","U.S. authorities ratchet up the pressure on Mexico's notorious Gulf Cartel .

"Brussels, Belgium (CNN) -- New Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko says peace is possible if Russian President Vladimir Putin is in the right mood. ""Sometimes, the position of Mr. Putin is quite pragmatic, sometimes it is very emotional,"" Poroshenko told CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Thursday in an exclusive interview, his first broadcast interview since taking over as Ukraine's leader on June 7. ""I just try to find out the time when he is more pragmatic than emotional."" He said negotiations with Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine would continue on Friday, the day his unilaterally declared cease-fire expires and the day that he also will sign a cooperation agreement with the European Union that sparked the crisis in his country. Escalating conflict? The talks are intended to end fighting between the Moscow-backed separatists and Ukrainian military and militia forces that threatens to escalate into a broader conflict. ""I am optimistic and I'm thinking that within a few weeks, maybe months, we can have a deal to establish peace,"" Poroshenko said in the interview with Amanpour while he was in Brussels for EU talks that will include signing the cooperation agreement between Europe and the former Soviet satellite. With the signing occurring the same day Poroshenko's seven-day cease-fire expires, concerns increased of further unrest in parts of eastern Ukraine and economic retaliation by Putin. Asked by Amanpour if he was the person who could forge a peace deal with Putin, Poroshenko said that was his goal. ""I'm ready to make peace with anybody"" ""I'm ready to make a peace deal with anybody,"" he said. ""I want to bring the peace to my country, not because we are weak, not because we are less patriotic than anybody. We are ready to defend my country because I hate the idea not to use the last opportunity to bring the peace to the region."" Russia and Ukraine have been engaged in a tense standoff since March when Russia annexed the previously Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea and massed troops along other parts of its border with Ukraine. In an effort to calm the situation, Poroshenko declared a cease-fire last week in Kiev's fight against pro-Russia separatists, but the violence continued. On Thursday, a Ukrainian national guard base came under attack in Donetsk, Anti-Terrorist Operation unit spokesman Vladislav Seleznyov said. Ukrainian troops were able to repel the attack but were bracing for another assault, according to Seleznyov. Two days earlier, Ukrainian authorities said pro-Russia militants shot down a military helicopter in eastern Ukraine, killing nine. Poroshenko told Amanpour that Friday's negotiations, which will include European officials, must show some progress before his unilateral cease-fire expires at the end of the day. He seeks a commitment to negotiations, the release of hostages, a cease-fire and the withdrawal of Russian-backed forces from Ukraine. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which operates a special monitoring mission in eastern Ukraine, said Thursday that four members of a Donetsk-based team of OSCE monitors apparently held by separatists had been released. Without Russian withdrawal, ""it is a real war"" ""All the troops on Ukrainian territory are Russian, they are Russian citizens,"" he said, adding that separatist leaders were from the Russian secret service. ""If that continues, it is a real war."" Asked what would happen without a sufficient response from the other side, Poroshenko only said he would make that decision Friday. On Wednesday, Russia's upper house of parliament voted, at Putin's request, to revoke the President's right to use troops in Ukraine. The move appeared to be an effort by Putin to defuse tension before Friday's watershed Ukraine-EU moment, which Putin opposes. Poroshenko called signing the agreement with the EU the second-most important moment in his nation's history, ranking only behind independence. ""Geographically we are already in Europe,"" he said, adding that Ukraine connected with European values. Asked whether he was worried about a negative economic reaction on Putin's part, Poroshenko said the Russian President recently promised not to undertake such steps. ""He promised that we will have a negotiation in a trilateral format, together with a European Union representative, so we do not expect any immediate negative reaction,"" Poroshenko said. At the same time, he made clear that in his mind, the Russian annexation of Crimea -- which has an ethnic Russian majority -- cannot stand. ""Crimea is Ukrainian"" Calling the issue a top priority, Poroshenko declared: ""Crimea is Ukrainian and the whole world confirmed that Crimea is Ukrainian."" Peace talks involving representatives from all sides occurred Wednesday in the Ukrainian city of Donetsk, Ukraine's official Ukrinform news agency said. Those participating included Ukrainian government officials, pro-Russia separatists from the restive eastern Luhansk and Donetsk regions, Russian officials and members of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the United States and Europe plan on possible further sanctions aimed at specific sectors of Russia's economy, depending on what choices Moscow makes ahead. ""It is critical for Russia to show in the next hours, literally, that they are moving to help disarm the separatists, to encourage them to disarm, to call on them to lay down their weapons and begin to become part of a legitimate political process,"" Kerry said Thursday after meeting with French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius. CNN's Mick Krever reported from Brussels for this report, which Tom Cohen wrote in Atlanta.","CNN EXCLUSIVE: Christiane Amanpour interviews Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko .

"(CNN) -- Six Baha'i leaders in Iran were seized and imprisoned this week, the religious group said. The act prompted condemnation and concern from the movement and a top American religious freedom panel. A U.S. panel says attacks on Iran's Baha'is have increased since Mahmoud Ahmadinejad became president. Iranian intelligence agents searched the homes of the six on Wednesday and then whisked them away, according to the Baha'i's World News Service. The report said the six are in Evin prison and that the arrests follow the detention in March of another Baha'i leader. The Iranian Foreign Ministry could not immediately be reached for comment, and the incident has not been mentioned in Iran's state-run media. ""Their only crime is their practice of the Baha'i faith,"" said Bani Dugal, the principal representative of the Baha'i international community to the United Nations. The U.S. State Department issued a statement Friday ""strongly"" condeming the arrests, which it said were ""a clear violation of the Iranian regime's international commitments and obligations to respect international religious freedom norms. ""We urge the authorities to release all Baha'is currently in detention and cease their ongoing harassment of the Iranian Baha'i community,"" the U.S. statement said. The group -- regarded as the largest non-Muslim religious minority in Iran -- says the arrests are reminiscent of roundups and killings of Baha'is that took place in Iran two decades ago. ""Especially disturbing is how this latest sweep recalls the wholesale arrest or abduction of the members of two national Iranian Baha'i governing councils in the early 1980s -- which led to the disappearance or execution of 17 individuals,"" Dugal said. ""The early morning raids on the homes of these prominent Baha'is were well-coordinated, and it is clear they represent a high-level effort to strike again at the Baha'is and to intimidate the Iranian Baha'i community at large,"" she added. The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom -- a government panel that advises the president and Congress -- condemned the Wednesday arrests, as well as another in March. The commission chairman called the acts the ""latest sign of the rapidly deteriorating status of religious freedom and other human rights in Iran."" The commission said the seven were members of an informal Baha'i group that tended to the needs of the community after the Iranian government banned all formal Baha'i activity in 1983. The commission chairman, Michael Cromartie, echoed the fears that the ""development signals a return to the darkest days of repression in Iran in the 1980s when Baha'is were routinely arrested, imprisoned, and executed."" The Baha'is are regarded as ""apostates"" in Iran and have been persecuted there for years. ""Since 1979, Iranian authorities have killed more than 200 Baha'i leaders, thousands have been arrested and imprisoned, and more than 10,000 have been dismissed from government and university jobs,"" the commission said. The commission said that since President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad came to power a few years ago, Baha'is ""have been harassed, physically attacked, arrested, and imprisoned."" ""During the past year, young Baha'i schoolchildren in primary and secondary schools increasingly have been attacked, vilified, pressured to convert to Islam, and in some cases, expelled on account of their religion."" The commission said other groups in the predominantly Shiite Muslim country of Iran, such Sufis and Christians, are subject to intimidation and harassment. Ahmadinejad's inflammatory statements about Israel have ""created a climate of fear"" among the country's Jews. The Baha'is say they have 5 million members across the globe, and about 300,000 in Iran. The Baha'is say their faith ""is the youngest of the world's independent religions"" and that its basic theme is that ""humanity is one single race and that the day has come for its unification in one global society."" They say their founder, Baha'u'llah (1817-1892), is regarded by Baha'is as ""the most recent in the line of Messengers of God that stretches back beyond recorded time and that includes Abraham, Moses, Buddha, Krishna, Zoroaster, Christ and Muhammad.""","Six Baha'i leaders arrested in raids on their homes, Baha'i news service says .

"Editor's note: On CNN's ""State of the Union,"" host and chief national correspondent John King goes outside the Beltway to report on the issues affecting communities across the country. Neal Williams has installed both high- and low-tech security as crime has risen in his neighborhood in decline. LAS VEGAS, Nevada (CNN) -- Neal Williams carefully picked his house 14 years ago with his wife and children in mind. ""Just a nice neighborhood,"" is how he recalls it. ""A lot of comfortable people to be around. Enjoyable nights ... walk around and walk down the street and say hi, talk to people."" Not any more. ""I have sat in my upstairs windows and watched kids trying to break into a house next door,"" Williams laments. One of his windows was recently broken, and he came home one day to see evidence someone had tried to kick in his door. He has installed new security systems, some high-tech, and also taken a low-tech precaution of deliberately not applying oil to a gate hinge. ""This is my infamous squeaky gate,"" he tells a recent visitor. ""That is one of my alarms."" Las Vegas is in many ways ground zero of the nation's housing crisis. ""Bank Owned"" signs are visible all over town -- so many foreclosures, in fact, that local real estate brokers have set up bus tours to take potential buyers and investors around town. Some agents are beginning to see evidence of progress. They report that inventory is down some and that more properties now bring multiple offers. Williams, however, says all he sees are the downsides. There are many vacant homes in his neighborhood because of foreclosures, and others have been rented out by banks that can't sell them. And with renters, he says, the sense of community has given way to more trash, graffiti and worse. ""There was a shooting just recently a couple of doors down,"" Williams said. ""We've been robbed on several occasions."" There is a financial price as well; Williams is current on his mortgage, but his home's value has collapsed.  Watch the pain and joy of the Vegas housing market » . ""I'm scared to look -- really scared to look,"" Williams says. ""I know it has gone down quite a bit. My wife says more than half. I honestly don't know."" His neighbor of just six months is moving, at a big loss, because of the rising crime. But not Williams. ""Do I want to put up with the embarrassment of people saying, 'You look like you live in a prison?' Yeah I'll deal with that embarrassment, but I know that I am safer and that is how I look at it."" Why not move? ""Well I'm a stubborn son of a gun. This is my house. This is where I am staying."" Only a few miles away is what you might call the flip side of the foreclosure fallout. Donald Leffert and his wife, Robyn Eddy-Leffert, just moved into their first home. ""It was pre-wired for stuff --- networking,"" Donald said. ""It was in a location we wanted. There was very little that needs to be done."" They had been looking at condos, but the crash in housing prices made bigger homes within reach. While checking out the yard, Donald found the stunning evidence: The real estate brochure from when the house was on the market two years ago. It is identical to his brochure, with two exceptions. The list price then: $400,000. Now: $179,000. ""Everything else on the paper is exactly the same,"" Donald says as he puts the papers side by side. ""The only difference is the date and the price."" A few small toys they found while preparing to move in makes them mindful their joy comes at the expense of some other family's foreclosure. ""It's pretty sad when you think about the people who have lost their homes,"" Eddy-Leffert said. ""You can't go into a house thinking of it being someone else's house or someone's home.""","Foreclosures change neighborhoods in Las Vegas .

"(CNN) -- On Sunday, Ukrainians will go to the polls to elect a new president three months after the ouster of corrupt former President Viktor Yanukovych. We will be there in Ukraine to observe the elections as members of an International Republican Institute delegation, witnessing a vote that is an important step not only for the Ukrainian people's struggle for democracy, but for the entire region's hopes for long-term stability and democratic development. In the lead-up to this critical vote, pro-Russian separatists, taking their cues from an increasingly aggressive Moscow, have attempted to undermine the elections in parts of eastern and southern Ukraine through threats and violence. In Donetsk and Luhansk, separatist leaders announced they will not participate in the presidential elections, while heavily armed militia fighters seize control of election offices and government buildings. Russian President Vladimir Putin has publicly called the election ""a step in the right direction,"" but tens of thousands of Russian troops remain near the Ukrainian border, Russian intelligence forces continue operating in eastern Ukraine and Putin has been noncommittal about whether his government will recognize the outcome of the presidential vote. As other countries in the region can attest, Russian interference in territorial sovereignty is nothing new. Since 1992, long before Putin came to power, Russia has occupied parts of Moldova, and for many years Moscow fostered a breakaway rebellion on Georgian soil, which eventually led to war in 2008. Shortly before this year's Sochi Olympics, Russian forces used the pretext of security for the games to advance miles farther into Georgia, pledging to return to the ceasefire lines once the Olympics had ended. Instead, Russia's military has fortified its gains in Georgia and shows no indication of withdrawal. Putin understands that successful elections and a new government committed to democratic ideals and anti-corruption will have a ripple effect throughout the region, including Russia. In a recent interview, Georgian Defense Minister Irakli Alasania said, ""If they [Ukrainians] survive this crisis there will be a future for all the countries in the region that border Russia."" That is why Putin has undertaken extraordinary measures to undermine Kiev's effort to solidify its status as a sovereign, independent, and democratic nation. To deter Putin's aggression, the United States must inflict immediate and serious economic consequences on Russia's financial, energy, and defense sectors. We must also expand and strengthen sanctions on Russian officials who were involved in the illegal annexation of Crimea. And Putin must know that additional acts of aggression will be met with even greater costs. The vast majority of Ukrainians -- like the citizens of so many countries in the region -- envision their future as a united democracy, free from foreign intervention and intimidation, and integrated with the rest of Europe. It is critical that Western nations support these aspirations through democratic assistance and economic development programs that support the new Ukrainian government as it enacts political and economic reforms to root out corruption, restore the rule of law and promote growth and prosperity for the Ukrainian people. The United States and our European Union allies must not allow Putin to continue to meddle in Ukrainian affairs and use the specter of military aggression to undermine the safety and liberty of millions of people seeking democracy in the region. It is our responsibility to stand with the Ukrainian people and their aspiration to live in a free and democratic society without fear of repression. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.","Sen.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- TLC will take a six-week break from producing new ""Jon & Kate Plus 8"" episodes to give the Gosselin family ""some time off to regroup"" after the couple split up, the cable network said. Jon and Kate Gosselin announced their official separation on Monday evening's show. Kate Gosselin filed for a divorce from Jon on Monday, after 10 years of marriage and four weeks into the current season of the popular reality show. ""Over the course of this weekend, Jon's activities have left me no choice but to file legal procedures in order to protect myself and our children,"" she said in a statement released by TLC on Tuesday. ""While there are reasons why it was appropriate and necessary for me to initiate this proceeding, I do not wish to discuss those reasons at this time, in the hope that all issues will be resolved amicably between Jon and myself."" Jon Gosselin said their eight children -- including sextuplets and a set of twins -- ""are still my number one priority."" iReport.com: Share your custody success stories . ""I love them and want to make sure they stay happy, healthy and safe,"" he said in a TLC statement. ""My job is being the best, most supportive and loving father that I can be to my kids, and not being married to Kate doesn't change that."" TLC said it would ""work closely with them to determine the best way to continue to tell their story as they navigate through this difficult time."" ""Following a retrospective of Jon and Kate's first 10 years airing on June 29th, the show will be on hiatus until August 3rd,"" the network said. ""During this time the family will take some time off to regroup and then a modified schedule will be in place to support the family's transition."" New episodes will resume on August 3, it said. Blog: Should the show go on? ""This will be a difficult transition for all of us, but Kate and I will work out a schedule that enables our kids to have plenty of quality time with both of us at home in Pennsylvania,"" Jon Gosselin said in Tuesday's statement. ""In terms of my marriage, it's no secret that the past six months or so have been very difficult for Kate and me. We are no different than other couples and parents who are facing a crossroads in their marriage. I am of course deeply saddened that we are divorcing."" The couple announced their separation on Monday's episode. ""It's just not good for our kids [for us] to be arguing in front of our kids,"" Jon said during Monday's broadcast. ""I'm not very fond of the idea, personally,"" Kate said. ""But I know it's necessary because my goal is peace for the kids."" iReport.com: Reality TV teaches real lesson . Jon said he realized he had been ""too passive."" ""I just let her rule the roost and do whatever she wanted,"" Jon said. ""Now I finally stood up on my own two feet and I'm proud of myself."" Kate said that though she doesn't hate Jon, their ""goals are different now."" ""I'm tired of smiling on the outside while I'm crying on the inside,"" Kate said. ""I've been doing that for a long time."" That might not surprise those who watch the show or follow their relationship in the media. Rumors have been swirling in tabloids and in other media outlets that the Gosselins' marriage was in trouble. Monday's episode was not short of tense moments between the couple. It began with the installation of ""crooked houses"" -- outdoor mini-houses the kids helped design that the Gosselins put on their property -- and Jon and Kate's disagreement as to where they should be placed. Jon cleared out a spot for the tiny homes, which was a little too far from the house for Kate's comfort. ""Any flak that he receives turns into a huge blowup anymore, unfortunately,"" Kate said. ""But I wanted to do the right thing for my kids, so I was caught again."" In the end, Kate won, and the houses were erected where she chose. The kids will continue living in their Wernersville, Pennsylvania, home, the couple said. Each parent will stay there during their time with them. When asked what worries her most, Kate said it's ""the label that we've failed, how that will affect our kids ... how they'll be another statistic.""

"LA PAZ, Bolivia (CNN) -- A 3-year-old Bolivian girl whose parents thought was dead and were preparing to bury remained in a coma but was improving Friday, while her mother and stepfather were being held on abuse charges, a hospital official said. The girl is suffering from a head injury, contusions throughout her body and burns on her face, said Jose Carlos Camacho, director of Hospital Universitario Japones in Santa Cruz. ""She is improving,"" Camacho told CNN on Friday. ""Yesterday she was able to take liquids orally. She is waking up but remains critical."" The girl's parents thought she was dead and held a six-hour wake Monday when a neighbor noticed she showed signs of life and took her to a medical center, the Santa Cruz, Bolivia, newspaper El Deber said on its Web site. The girl's stepfather, Gumercindo Ali Mamani, 20, and mother, Lucia Chana, 22, appeared in court Tuesday and were ordered held on abuse charges, the newspaper said. Their 3-month-old son was placed in protective custody. The severity of the girl's coma is rated about 14 or 15 on a 15-point scale, in which 15 is the best,  Camacho said.  A patient is usually placed on life-support machinery at 8 on the scale, said Camacho, who is also a surgeon. The girl suffered a subdural hematoma, a traumatic injury in which blood pools between two protective layers of the brain, but did not require surgery, Camacho said. A subdural hematoma can result from a blow to the head or from shaking. Doctors expect the girl to remain in intensive care for about another week before she can be moved to intermediate care. According to El Deber, the stepfather asked for forgiveness but the mother only said that the girl was often restless. CNN's Arthur Brice contributed to this report.","Bolivian parents were preparing to bury their 3-year- old girl .

"(CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama had stern words for his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin over Russia's actions in Ukraine, following a meeting Thursday of G7 leaders in Brussels, Belgium, at which Russia was excluded. Putin ""has a chance to get back into a lane of international law,"" Obama said. But for this to happen, he said, Putin must take steps over the coming weeks that include recognizing Ukraine's new President-elect Petro Poroshenko, stopping the flow of weapons over the border into Ukraine and ceasing Russian support for pro-Russia separatists in Ukraine. ""We cannot simply allow drift,"" Obama said, speaking alongside British Prime Minister David Cameron following bilateral talks. ""The mere fact that some of the Russian soldiers have moved back from the border and that Russia is now destabilizing Ukraine through surrogates, rather than overtly and explicitly, does not mean that we can afford three months, or four months, or six months, of continued violence and conflict in eastern Ukraine."" If Russia does not de-escalate the situation, the G7 leaders are united and ready to impose further painful economic sanctions, Obama said, with consequences for the Russian people. ""Today, in contrast to a growing global economy, a sluggish Russian economy is even weaker because of the choices made by Russia's leadership,"" he said. Putin was excluded from what was originally planned as a G8 summit in Sochi, Russia, as part of measures to sanction Moscow over its annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region. It's the first time in some 20 years that Russia has not been part of the meeting of world economic powers, Obama said, adding that the step is warranted because Moscow's actions have violated international law and gone against the group's principles. Energy security . Putin may not have been at the table, but the summit's message was clearly directed at Russia. In a joint statement issued late Wednesday, the G7 leaders pledged their support for the Ukrainian people and government ""in the face of unacceptable interference in Ukraine's sovereign affairs by the Russian Federation."" They also warned Moscow that they are ready to intensify targeted economic sanctions and impose new costs on Russia ""should events so require."" ""Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea, and actions to de-stabilize eastern Ukraine are unacceptable and must stop,"" the statement said. ""We urge the Russian Federation to recognize the results of the election, complete the withdrawal of its military forces on the border with Ukraine, stop the flow of weapons and militants across the border and to exercise its influence among armed separatists to lay down their weapons and renounce violence."" The G7 leaders also talked about energy security, amid concern over Europe's reliance on Russian natural gas and Moscow's capacity to hold nations hostage to political maneuvering. Obama will next head to Paris, where he will dine with French President Francois Hollande. Putin also will be hosted by the French President on Thursday -- but at a separate dinner. Obama and Putin are among a number of leaders invited to take part in ceremonies in France to mark the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings, which helped change the course of World War II. They are likely to cross paths while both are in France, Obama said, but no formal talks have been announced. If they should speak, Obama added, he will give Putin the same message on Ukraine that he has given him in phone calls over past weeks and in his public statements. There may be one touchy subject at Obama's dinner with Hollande. In his remarks after the G7 meeting, Obama said he had ""expressed concerns about continuing significant defense deals with Russia at a time when they've violated basic international law,"" a reference to a $1.6 billion French deal to sell warships to Moscow. ""President Hollande understands my position,"" Obama said, adding that he in turn recognizes that this is a big deal for France and that it's important for jobs. Nonetheless, Obama said, ""I think it would've been preferable to press the pause button. President Hollande so far has not done so."" Putin: I won't avoid anyone . Although Putin was not invited to the G7 meeting -- which brings together the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy and Japan -- he will have talks on Ukraine with some G7 leaders while they are all in France. Besides Hollande, they include German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Cameron. The D-Day events, which include a spectacular fireworks show Thursday evening along the Normandy coastline and continue into the weekend, may also bring Putin and Ukraine's President-elect Petro Poroshenko face to face. Asked in an interview with French television station TF1 if he would speak with Ukraine's new leader, Putin said he will not ""evade"" Poroshenko or anyone else. ""There will be other guests, and I'm not going to avoid any of them. I will talk with all of them,"" he said, according to the Kremlin's translation. Poroshenko also did not exclude the possibility, speaking at a news conference Wednesday in Warsaw. ""As things stand now, a meeting between me and Putin is not envisaged, but I do not rule out that it could take place in one format or another. So let's talk about it when there are grounds for it,"" he said. Hollande said that both were invited, although Poroshenko is due to arrive only on Saturday. Putin: No Russian intervention in Ukraine . Questioned in the same TF1 interview about Russia's intentions in Ukraine, Putin denied it had sought to annex or destabilize its neighbor. ""We never did that,"" he said. ""The Ukrainian government must now sit down and talk with their own people instead of using weapons, tanks, planes and helicopters. They must start the negotiating process."" Kiev and the West have said the separatists in Ukraine are coordinated and supplied by Russia. Asked if it was true that Russia had intervened directly, Putin was again vehement in his denial. ""There are no armed forces, no Russian 'instructors' in southeastern Ukraine. And there never were any,"" he said. Putin reiterated his position that Russia respects the Ukrainian people's vote and that Moscow will work with the authorities in Kiev. He also said Russia recognizes Ukraine's sovereignty, while acknowledging that any move by Kiev to join NATO ""worries us."" This concern was a factor in Russia's annexation of Crimea, Putin told the French broadcaster, following the ouster of President Viktor Yanukovych in what Moscow regards as an illegal coup. Whether Putin and Poroshenko meet personally, Russia will give the new Ukrainian president some official recognition when its ambassador to Ukraine attends Poroshenko's inauguration Saturday. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich said Thursday, according to state-run RIA Novosti, that Ambassador Mikhail Zurabov will also resume his duties in Kiev. ""He is returning to Kiev in order to continue executing his functions,"" Lukashevich said. Obama vows to stand with Ukraine as he meets President-elect in Poland . Opinion: Putin's empire building is not a new Cold War . Russia and Ukraine bicker in U.N. meeting . CNN's Laura Smith-Spark wrote and reported in London.

"(CNN)  -- Three years ago, the U.S. Armed Forces struggled with a serious recruiting crisis, a crisis that evaporated temporarily only when the economy slumped. As it recovers and our population continues to age, the Armed Forces will face yet another challenge in recruiting the high-quality people needed for the modern military. For that reason, the Department of Defense identified the DREAM Act as a smart way to expand the pool of eligible candidates for enlistment. The Development, Relief and Education of Alien Minors (DREAM) Act is a bipartisan bill that would provide a path to legal residence for undocumented young people who were brought to the United States as children. The conditions: They must graduate from high school, demonstrate good moral character, and -- to keep their legal status -- complete at least two years of higher education or at least two years service in the U.S. military. Without the relief of the DREAM Act, the future of these American-educated young people is bleak. About 65,000 such eligible students graduate from U.S. high schools each year, but upon graduation, these young people, who include honor roll students, star athletes and junior ROTC members, hit a wall. Instead of advancing to college or the military and later repaying the investment that taxpayers made in their education, they live in fear of being discovered by the Department of Homeland Security and deported to their ""home"" country, even if it is a country they cannot remember and where they have no friends, family or support. Two potential DREAM Act students are David Cho, a senior honors student at the University of California, Los Angeles, and Cesar Vargas, a third-year law student at the City University of New York. Cho, who dreams of joining the Air Force after graduation, is at the top of his class and has lived in the United States since he was 9 years old. Vargas has lived here since he was 5 and wants to be a military lawyer after graduation. David and Cesar are exactly the kind of recruits the military needs: self-motivated and eager to defend the country they love. Without the DREAM Act, both will be deported. Bill Carr, former acting deputy undersecretary of defense for military personnel, has called the DREAM Act ""very appealing"" to the military because it applies to the ""cream of the crop"" of students. Potential DREAM Act beneficiaries like David and Cesar are a military recruiter's dream candidates for enlistment, even if they have no legal status. They are Americanized, having lived in the United States for at least five years, unlike the newly lawful permanent residents whom the military currently enlists. DREAM Act beneficiaries have no adult period of residence in a foreign country, making it easier to perform background checks for security clearance. They often speak both English and another language fluently. Many have participated in Junior ROTC in high school. They do not have criminal records or other evidence of bad character. They have graduated from a U.S. high school. If approved as DREAM Act beneficiaries, they will have passed rigorous criminal background and security checks from DHS. They will have ""conditional lawful residence,"" which is recognized under current military recruiting regulations. Thus, the military will not have to change its regulations or process their enlistments differently from other recruits. Finally, they will be motivated to serve the United States so as to be given a chance to stay here. Opponents of the DREAM Act call it a ""sugar-coated"" amnesty that  rewards lawbreakers. To them, the best solution to the problem of illegal residents who are also high-achieving students with dreams of serving in the military is deportation, even though that would massively benefit their countries of birth while depriving the United States of their talents. Instead of wearing our uniforms, these recruits could be recruited to work for foreign governments, foreign militaries and foreign intelligence agencies. At a time when we are focused on protecting our borders and quashing threats to our national security, it seems unwise to export thousands of American-educated and American-acculturated young people to militaries other than our own. The House and Senate are poised to consider the DREAM Act during the current lame duck session of Congress. The vote presents an opportunity for our lawmakers to increase military recruitment, enhance U.S. national security and help high-achieving young people at the same time. I strongly urge members of Congress to pass this long overdue measure. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Margaret Stock.","Margaret Stock: Armed Forces expect to face another recruiting crisis as economy recovers .
DREAM Act could help both undocumented young people and the military, she says .
Stock: Those brought to U.S. as kids could serve in U.S. military in a path to citizenship .
This allows high-achieving young people to enlist rather than be deported, she writes ."
"(CNN) -- A former Playboy Playmate of the Year remained in custody in Los Angeles, California, Thursday after being arraigned in the alleged shooting of her husband. Victoria Rathgeb, 66, entered a plea of not guilty when she was arraigned on a charge of attempted murder in a courtroom Tuesday. Rathgeb is charged with trying to kill her husband, Bruce Rathgeb, according to a Shiara Davila-Morales, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office. Bruce Rathgeb remains hospitalized at Cedars Sinai Hospital. According to the entertainment website, TMZ, the shooting happened at the couple's West Hollywood apartment, and when officers first arrived at the scene Rathgeb allegedly told them that it was a drug dealer who shot her husband. Morales told CNN that Rathgeb is being held in lieu of a $1.5 million bond and has a preliminary hearing on November 1. She was represented by a public defender at the arraignment. If convicted, Rathgeb faces life in prison with the possibility of parole. Los Angeles police confirmed Rathgeb was arrested on October 16 for allegedly shooting her husband, but said they would not comment further because of the ongoing investigation. According to the L.A. Sheriff's Department, Rathgeb is being held at the Century Regional Detention Facility. Rathgeb was Playboy's 1968 Playmate of the Year, under the name Angela Dorian. She also went by the name Victoria Vetri and had a small part in the movie ""Rosemary's Baby."" Rathgeb also had roles in popular television shows from the 1960s and 1970s such as ""Hogan's Heroes,"" and ""Star Trek."" Author and Film Historian, Tom Lisanti profiled Rathgeb for his book, ""Glamour Girls of Sixties Hollywood."" ""Her real name is Victoria Vetri and she went by the stage name, Angela Dorian, and she was actually considered a pretty good actress and got a lot of television roles. Because of her Italian heritage, she played mostly ethnic characters."" According to Lisanti, Rathgeb's popularity heightened when she played the part of Mia Farrow's neighbor in Roman Polanski's film, ""Rosemary's Baby."" ""It was Polanski who told her to use her real name and actually had a line in the movie where Mia Farrow says, 'I thought you were Victoria Vetri, the actress,' and it was sort of a joke because, of course she was Victoria Vetri."" According to Lisanti, the early '60s were a difficult time for actresses because by the middle of the decade studio contracts were collapsing and independent movies like ""Bonnie and Clyde"" and ""The Graduate"" were starting. ""There was also this introduction of nudity in films that were becoming really popular and these were women, who were raised in the Eisenhower '50s -- so, they lost a lot of roles because they wouldn't go topless. Obviously Victoria wasn't one of those women -- and so she started as a serious actress and then switched to becoming a sex symbol. ""Her biggest role was in a movie called, 'When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth,' and she was, like a lot of actresses at that time, trying to emulate Raquel Welch in 'One Million Years B.C.' but she never achieved that level of fame."" Rathgeb quietly left acting in late 1970s and went back to doing that age old job of out-of-work actresses -- waitressing, he said.","Rathgeb, 66, was Playmate of the Year in 1968 .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The security guard accused of assassinating the governor of Pakistan's Punjab province was ordered into police custody for five days Thursday, after a court hearing on his case had to be moved several times. Muhammad Mumtaz Qadri has been hailed as a hero in some quarters for gunning down Gov. Salman Taseer, a liberal lawmaker who had spoken out against the country's blasphemy laws, which make it a crime punishable by death to insult Islam, the Quran or the Prophet Mohammed. ""He had taken a very brave position on the blasphemy laws,"" said Taseer's sister-in-law, Ayesha Tammy Haq, who noted that the governor had come under intense criticism from fundamentalists after suggesting that the capital punishment aspect of the law ought to be revisited. ""I think the Pakistan People's Party will honor its commitment"" to amend the law, she said. Qadri's hearing in a Pakistani anti-terrorism court came hours after it was originally supposed to be held, and illustrated the power of hard-liners on Pakistan's streets to influence court proceedings. Police had planned to bring the suspect to the court in Rawalpindi early Thursday morning. But Qadri's supporters -- conservative lawyers, madrasa students and others -- converged on the courthouse. Many cheered him for shooting Taseer, and for security reasons authorities changed plans and drove Qadri to Islamabad in an armored vehicle, planning to hold the hearing in a makeshift court in a heavily secured area of the capital. There were three layers of security at that site, and media and onlookers were kept well back from the vehicle that carried Qadri. Officials say Judge Malik Mohammad Akram Awan was asked to come to Islamabad to preside over the hearing. But the crowd of supporters in Rawalpindi prevented the judge from traveling to the capital, so police had to bring Qadri back to Rawalpindi to hold his hearing there. Officials say police had asked to keep Qadri in custody for 12 days, but the judge granted five. Investigators plan to continue interrogating the bodyguard. They're trying to determine if he acted alone, or had outside help. On Wednesday, authorities said that Qadri was banned five months ago by a provincial police official from providing security to VIPs. The director inspector general of Punjab Police said the guard had extremist views and it had been determined it was unsafe for him to guard important officials, said the Pakistani president's special political adviser, Faisal Raza Abidi. Despite that assessment, the Punjab Police employed Qadri for security this week. The warning signs about Qadri go back even further, said Rana Shahid Pervez, senior police official in Rawalpindi. Pakistani intelligence agencies had warned officials in 2004 not to use Qadri after they uncovered connections between him and the religious group Dawat-e-Islami -- a Sunni group that claims it has a closer connection to the Prophet Mohammed than other Muslims. Pervez said Qadri came from an area of Rawalpindi called Sadiq Abad, adjacent to the capital, Islamabad. He came from a poor family and his father is a laborer who built homes. Qadri joined the police force in 2002, and was selected for the elite force course in 2008, four years after the warning from intelligence agencies, Pervez said. Qadri was one of 468 elite force guards in the Rawalpindi Police, which randomly assigns them as escorts to VIPs and officials like Taseer. Qadri was assigned to the governor on Tuesday. He had been his security guard many times before the shooting, according to Pervez, who disputed the reported link to Dawat-e-Islami. Qadri ""killed the governor totally from his own beliefs regarding Mohammed, and no group was behind him,"" Pervez said. The shooting occurred at a market in Islamabad. Qadri confessed to assassinating Taseer because ""he did blasphemy of the Prophet Mohammed,"" Naeem Iqbal, spokesman for Islamabad police, said Tuesday. Qadri told police Taseer had described the blasphemy laws as ""the black laws."" After the shooting, Qadri immediately surrendered to authorities, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported, citing Interior Minister Rahman Malik. Dr. Sharif Astori, a spokesman for Poly Clinic Hospital, told CNN doctors counted 26 bullets in the governor's body. A spotlight was put on Pakistan's controversial law in November when a Christian woman, Asia Bibi of Punjab province, was sentenced to death for blasphemy. A court found the 45-year-old woman guilty of defiling the name of the Prophet Mohammed during a 2009 argument with fellow Muslim field workers. An investigation by a Pakistani government ministry found the charges against Bibi stemmed from ""religious and personal enmity"" and recommended she be released. The government also said it would review the law. Taseer said he would like to see the law ""changed in such a way that it just basically says, if you insult any prophet, no matter who he is, that's a criminal offense, but certainly not punishable by death."" CNN's Nasir Habib and Nosheen Abbas contributed to this report.","The suspect finally appeared in court in Rawalpindi after several changes of venue .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- New York City's rate of HIV infection is about three times the national rate, according to estimates released Wednesday by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Rapid HIV test swabs incubate at the Iris House in New York in 2007. The agency estimates that 72 of every 100,000 New Yorkers -- a total of 4,800 individuals -- contracted HIV in 2006, more than triple the national rate of 23 per 100,000. The findings are based on new lab technology and a newly derived statistical model developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The lab technology enables health officials to determine whether HIV-positive individuals contracted the virus within the past five months, and the statistical model allows researchers to then make projections about a population's infection rate. HIV, or the human immunodeficiency virus, is the virus that causes AIDS. The Health Department points to the city's demographics. ""The populations that bear the greatest burden nationally -- blacks, for example, and men who have sex with men -- are highly represented in New York City,"" Health Commissioner Thomas Freidan said in a written statement. ""Because HIV is more prevalent within those groups, the risk of HIV infection per sexual contact is higher."" In June, the city launched a three-year initiative to administer HIV tests to the 250,000 Bronx adults who have never been tested. The program was announced just days after release of a study finding a high rate of ""unsafe sexual behavior"" in the city. Freidan said the study showed that 36 percent of gay and bisexual New York men who had five or more partners in the previous year did not use condoms consistently. ""This is a core group which is at high risk for getting and spreading HIV,"" Freidan said. In July, a study of 452 men interviewed anonymously at gay bars and clubs found 39 percent of those having sex with other men had not revealed their sexual orientation to their doctors, significantly diminishing their likelihood of being tested for HIV.","Agency estimates 72 of every 100,000 New Yorkers contracted HIV in 2006 .

"Donetsk, Ukraine (CNN) -- A battle between pro-Russia separatists and government forces at Donetsk airport in eastern Ukraine has claimed 40 lives, authorities said Tuesday, in what is the deadliest outbreak of violence yet in the flashpoint city. An additional 31 people have been injured, including four civilians, according to the website of the Donetsk mayor, Alexander Lukyanchenko. Two of the fatalities are civilians. The conflict at Donetsk International Airport broke out only hours after newly elected Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said he'd potentially like to negotiate a way out of the crisis. After Ukrainian forces moved in against the militants Monday, the deadly assault continued overnight. The airport remained closed Tuesday despite an easing in the gunfire, as conflicting accounts emerged of how many had lost their lives. The Donetsk mayor's website didn't specify how many of the 40 killed in the airport standoff were separatists. But a spokeswoman for the separatist self-declared ""Donetsk People's Republic"" (DNR) told CNN that 35 separatists had been killed and about 60 injured in Monday's fighting. Although the separatists earlier claimed they controlled the airport, it became clear as Tuesday wore on that the Ukrainian military had taken charge. The official website of Ukrainian Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said late Tuesday the ""Airport in Donetsk is fully under our control."" The occasional exchange of gunfire and blasts could be heard from the airport but it was not clear if the shots were fired by military as they maintained a perimeter or whether separatist forces were still present within its territory. Two blown-out trucks nearby appeared to have been hit by heavy weapons. Human remains were still visible, suggesting this may have been the cause of some of the casualties Monday. The separatist movement in Donetsk believed it was offered a three-hour 'truce' Tuesday to leave the city of Donetsk, according to a spokeswoman for the DNR who asked not to be identified to avoid possible arrest. The truce was offered between 1 and 4 p.m. local time (6 a.m. and 9 a.m. ET), she said. The DPR learned of this truce online, the spokeswoman told CNN, adding that Ukrainian armed forces were threatening to bomb separatist strongholds in the city if they failed to leave. The Ukrainian government denied offering rebels any such truce. The Ukraine Government's Anti-Terror Operation (ATO) told CNN there is a longstanding offer of amnesty to any separatist who turns himself in and gives up his weapons, unless he (or she) is guilty of murder. Morgue piled with bodies . A CNN team at a morgue in Donetsk saw a large pile of separatist militant bodies, many of which had been torn apart by shrapnel and explosions. Doctors there said 31 bodies had been brought in with different types of injuries, from bullet wounds to those caused by heavy weapons and explosions. The remains included the body of a woman civilian. Doctors also said some locals had arrived during the morning to identify and collect their relatives from among the dead. The airport clashes marked the worst violence that this key population center in eastern Ukraine has seen since the start of the crisis. A statement posted on the mayor's website Monday advised residents to stay in their homes as sounds of gunfire and explosions cracked through the air. Elsewhere in the Donetsk region, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said it has had no contact with one of its Donetsk-based teams since around 6 p.m. (11 a.m. ET) Monday . The team of four -- of Swiss, Turkish, Estonian and Danish nationality -- was on a routine patrol east of Donetsk when it was last heard from. The OSCE says it is using contacts on the ground to try to determine where the monitors are. The last time an OSCE team went missing in Donetsk, its members turned up in the hands of militant separatists in the flashpoint town of Slovyansk. They were freed just over a week later. In another development, NATO has observed Russian troop movement near the Russia-Ukraine border recently, a NATO officer told CNN. Speaking on condition of anonymity, the officer said this included signs of Russian equipment and supplies being packed or prepared for movement, and that the activity could signal a slow or staged withdrawal of forces. Turning point? The Ukrainian security forces' muscular airport assault may signal a shift in approach as the new president takes charge in Kiev. A senior Ukrainian official told CNN's Jim Sciutto in Kiev that it is ""now or never"" in the fight against militants in the East. ""We have been patient for far too long,"" he said, indicating that with the election over, the new government believes it has a mandate to put the insurgency to rest. U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoff Pyatt told CNN that the crisis is now entering its ""most kinetic phase."" At the same time, Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday urged an immediate halt to the operation against separatist militants in Ukraine's south and east, the Kremlin said. Putin also spoke by phone with Italy's Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of the need for the leadership in Kiev to start a peaceful dialogue with representatives of Ukraine's regions, it said. Kiev and the West have accused Moscow of backing Ukraine's separatists. But Russia has denied having direct influence over the pro-Russia militants and says the unrest is due to the actions of far-right ultranationalists. At a news conference Monday in Kiev, Poroshenko, the newly elected president, said that Russia needed to participate in bringing peace to eastern Ukraine. He also reiterated that European integration would be his priority. In addition to the unrest roiling the east, Poroshenko, a candy tycoon known as the ""Chocolate King,"" faces the challenge posed by Ukraine's ailing economy and a looming crisis over Russia's supply of natural gas to Ukraine. Russia's energy giant Gazprom says Ukraine owes it $3.5 billion for gas already supplied and has threatened to turn off the taps if no payment is made. But Ukraine's interim government has said that the price must be renegotiated after Russia hiked it up this spring. Prime Minister Arensiy Yatsenyuk said on his website Tuesday that Ukraine would take the issue to an international court if Russia's Gazprom and his own country's Naftogaz do not sign an agreement by May 29. Anti-aircraft weapons . Government air and ground forces attacked the pro-Russia militants after they seized a terminal at the airport early Monday. The troops moved in after the separatists ignored a government ultimatum to vacate the premises, said the country's anti-terror office spokesman, Vladislav Seleznev. After a Ukrainian military plane ""made a preliminary shot,"" paratroopers landed and began clearing the airport, Ukrinform reported. In the fighting, a separatist anti-aircraft gun was destroyed, the news agency said. Although the gunfire had largely halted by Tuesday morning, the airport is not expected to reopen for the moment. The preliminary evaluation is that the airport suffered minor damage in the fighting, Seleznev said. Experts are working to establish whether all the navigation and other systems are working, he said. In any case, it is not judged safe for airplanes to fly because the separatists have weapons capable of shooting at aircraft and seem willing to use them. Seleznev also warned in a Facebook post Tuesday that if the rebels do not surrender, ""terrorist"" targets in Donetsk will be hit by ""special high-precision weapons."" Government officials had been optimistic that flights would resume by 9 a.m. (2 a.m. ET) Tuesday, but given the situation, it remains unclear when the airport will reopen. Ukraine's acting Interior Minister Arsen Avakov posted on his Facebook page Tuesday that an airstrike had destroyed a training camp in Yasenakh, in the Luhansk region. Separatist unrest over recent weeks has centered in the country's Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Internal reconciliation . U.S. President Barack Obama congratulated Ukrainians for casting their ballots Sunday and criticized Russia-backed separatists, whom he accused of trying to block voting. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, in a phone call with Poroshenko, hailed the vote as ""a clear commitment of the Ukrainian people to unity and democracy as well as a peaceful solution to the current conflict,"" Merkel's spokesman said in a statement. She said Germany would continue to support Ukraine on its democratic path, the spokesman said, adding that the two leaders agreed on the need to pursue internal reconciliation through national dialogue and constitutional reform. At a news conference Monday, OSCE Parliamentary President Joao Soares said the presidential election was fair and represented the will of the Ukrainian people, despite major problems in Donetsk and Luhansk.

"San Francisco, California -- A federal judge ruled Wednesday that the government is liable for illegally wiretapping an Islamic charity without a valid search warrant. The ruling in Northern California District Court reaffirmed an earlier decision that the warrantless wiretaps conducted on an Oregon-based Islamic non-profit organization were illegal. In Wednesday's ruling, District Judge Vaughn R. Walker said the government is liable for damages from the illegal wiretapping. The United States has designated the Oregon-based al-Haramain Islamic Foundation as a terrorist organization. The group, which has sued the government over alleged warrantless wiretapping, is demanding classified information about the program launched by President George W. Bush's administration. U.S. officials have refused to tell the charity's lawyers whether the group was subjected to presidentially authorized, warrantless, foreign intelligence surveillance in 2004 and, if so, what information was obtained. The U.S. stance originated under the Bush administration in what is called the ""state secrets"" defense, which allows courts to block lawsuits against the government on grounds that the litigation could harm national security. Under Bush, the government refused to turn over any classified evidence. Attorney General Eric Holder, appointed when President Barack Obama took office in January 2009, has so far maintained the state secrets defense in the al-Haramain case, but indicated a willingness to consider sharing information with judges in certain cases. ""An additional review was conducted at the highest levels of the Department of Justice to determine whether continued invocation of the privilege was warranted,"" the government told the court last May. ""Based on that review, it is the government's position that disclosure of classified information ... would create intolerable risks to national security."" Walker's ruling Wednesday rejected that defense, saying that for the purposes of the case, the court decided there was no warrant for the wiretaps because the government refused to confirm one existed. ""Defendants have foregone multiple opportunities to show that a warrant existed, including specifically rejecting the method created by Congress for this very purpose,"" the ruling said. Justice Department spokeswoman Tracy Schmaler said the ruling was under review. Schmaler noted that the Obama administration policy on the state secrets defense has changed so that it is ""narrowly tailored."" The government, which has previously appealed rulings against it in the case, has 45 days to notify the court if it intends to file an appeal this time. In 2007 the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a ruling by Walker in the same case in which he had rejected the government's state secrets privilege. The ruling, however, left unanswered whether applicable laws could pre-empt the state secrets privilege, so al-Haramain went back to court to continue the fight on that issue. CNN's Bill Mears and Terry Frieden contributed to this story.","Ruling reaffirmed earlier decision that the warrantless wiretaps were illegal.

"(CNN) -- The death toll from flooding in the Philippines climbed to 140 Monday as a tropical depression in the Pacific sparked new fears of flooding. iReporter Doranne Lim captures the desperate measures some people are being forced to take. Flood water began to subside after a weekend that saw Manila hit with its heaviest rainfall in more than 40 years. More than 80 percent of the capital was under water at one point Sunday. The deluge caused by Tropical Storm Ketsana, which has since strengthened into a typhoon, engulfed whole houses and buses. At least 140 people have died, the National Disaster Coordinating Council said. Are you there? Share your story or pictures . Manila, on the island of Luzon, and the nearby province of Rizal bore the brunt of the storm. People huddled on rooftops Sunday waiting on army helicopters to pluck them to safety. Others used ropes to wade through waist-deep muddy waters. Power and water supply failed in some areas. Roads were rendered impassable, making rescue efforts challenging. Rescue crews were handing out food rations.  See incredible images of the flooding » . ""Right now the challenge is to find out how many people have actually died and how many people we have to take care of in terms of people who've been displaced,"" said Richard Gordon, the chairman of the Philippines National Red Cross. ""We're really talking about maybe hundreds of thousands of people,"" with about 280,000 to 300,000 displaced in the island of Luzon alone, he said. Though the Philippines is no stranger to floods, Saturday's downpours approached a record, with a month's worth of rain falling within six hours. The average rainfall for the month of September is 391 mm (15.4 inches), said Gilberto Teodoro, chairman of the National Disaster Coordinating Council. The capital experienced 341 mm (13.4 inches) between 8 a.m. and 2 p.m., he said. Officials worried that if the rains return, they could bring more floods if reservoirs burst. ""We're hoping that there will be no more breaching of the dams,"" Gordon said. ""That's one of the things that are very disconcerting to many people right now.""

"Editor's note: This story is based on interrogation reports that form part of the prosecution case in the forthcoming trial of six Belgian citizens charged with participation in a terrorist group. Versions of those documents were obtained by CNN from the defense attorney of one of those suspects. The statement by Bryant Vinas was compiled from an interview he gave Belgian prosecutors in March in New York and was confirmed by U.S. prosecutors as authentic. The statement by Walid Othmani was given to French investigators and was authenticated by Belgian prosecutors. A photo purporting to show Moez Garsallaoui firing a rocket launcher on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. (CNN) -- Between late July and early December of 2008 four members of a Belgian-French group returned to Europe from the Pakistan-Afghanistan border region. On December 11, Belgian counter-terrorism police launched one of the largest operations in the country's history, arrested six people and charged them with participation in a terrorist group. According to Belgian counter-terrorism sources, the trigger for the Brussels arrests was an intercepted e-mail sent by one of the alleged recruits, Hicham Beyayo, in early December shortly after he returned to Belgium. The e-mail allegedly suggested that Beyayo had been given the green light to launch an attack in Belgium. However no explosives were recovered by Belgian police, and some terrorism analysts are skeptical that an attack was imminent. Beyayo's lawyer, Christophe Marchand, told CNN in February that the email was merely ""tough talk"" to impress an ex-girlfriend. Belgian authorities continue to insist that the alleged cell was a potential national security threat. Of those still thought to be at large, one was Moez Garsallaoui, whose wife Malika el Aroud was among those arrested in Belgium. Read how al Qaeda is changing . He issued this threat to Belgium authorities on his wife's Web site on May 11 this year. ""If you thought that you could pressure me to slow down through the arrest of my wife, you were wrong. It won't stop me fulfilling my objectives...the place of my wife in my heart and the heart of all the mujahedeen is greater than ever. ... Surprises are sure to be in store for you in the days ahead. Those who laugh last, laugh more."" Such threats will have caused concern because of Garsallaoui's wide connections in European militant circles. Two of his Brussels associates, Bassam Ayachi, 62, and Raphael Gendron, 33, are in custody in Italy, charged with being leaders of a logistical support team for al Qaeda. They have denied the charges. The duo, who were detained in the port city of Bari in November for trying to illegally smuggle Middle Easterners into the country, had allegedly talked to each other in their detention center about what sounded like a scheme to attack Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris, a conversation bugged by Italian police. French officials have said they were never aware of a concrete plot to attack the airport. According to a senior Belgian intelligence official, Garsallaoui, his wife, and several others who traveled to Pakistan were all connected through the Centre Islamique Belge, an organization Belgian authorities say espouses hardline Salafist and pro-al Qaeda views. In past interviews the center's founder Bassam Ayachi has said his organization concentrates on pastoral care for Muslims in Brussels and did not promote pro-al Qaeda views. Members of the Brussels-based group are believed to have received terrorist training in other countries besides Pakistan. In late May, several days before President Barack Obama traveled to Cairo, Egypt, to give a major speech, several Belgian citizens were arrested in Egypt and accused of being members of a terrorist cell affiliated with al Qaeda. A senior Belgian counter-terrorism official told CNN that two Belgians now in Egyptian custody were known associates of Garsallaoui at the Centre Islamique Belge and are believed to have received military training with an ultra-extremist Palestinian group in Gaza. ""Anybody who gets such training is obviously a potential danger if they return to Europe,"" said the official. While in Pakistan the Europeans also had contact with Bryant Vinas, an American who told prosecutors he was there to fight in Afghanistan. Read how Vinas went to fight Americans in Afghanistan . New Attack Plans . Vinas says he was told, while on a mountain walk with a Belgian-Moroccan friend, Hicham Bouhali Zrioul, about a new course being taught by al Qaeda called ""international operations,"" set up by its head of international operations. Vinas later identified him as Abu Hafith. Hafith, he stated, was responsible for recruitment and direction of terrorist cells, and attacks outside Pakistan and Afghanistan. Hafith was identified by his initials in the legal document but CNN obtained his name from a source briefed on the case. He is believed to be still at large in the Pakistan-Afghan border area. Vinas was told that the training course Hafith set up focused on kidnapping and assassination, including instruction on the use of silencers and how to break into a property. Read how al Qaeda is adapting its training . The revelations raise the possibility that al Qaeda was developing a program of targeted assassinations. Though al Qaeda has carried out some assassinations in the past, most of its attacks in the West have not targeted any particular individuals but crowded areas, such as mass transport. Vinas stated that Zrioul also discussed with him an attack on the Brussels metro, telling him it was a soft target because it was poorly protected. He said Zrioul also raised the possibility of launching an attack on a European football stadium. A senior Belgian intelligence official told CNN that Belgian security services only learned about these conversations in March 2009 after Vinas met with Belgian prosecutors in New York. Although concerned, Belgium's intelligence service concluded that no concrete plot had likely existed, said the official. Such conversations illustrate the terror networks' continued desire to inflict mass casualties. Vinas stated that he himself gave detailed briefings to al Qaeda chiefs in Waziristan in September 2008 about how the Long Island Commuter Rail service worked, according to a federal indictment earlier this month. Shortly after Vinas' arrest in 2008, Penn Station and much of the New York mass transit system was put on high alert.","Return of alleged Western militants to Europe sparked Belgian antiterror operation .

"Washington (CNN) -- One of the world's most famous poets and writers, an inspiration to countless women, recently celebrated her birthday. At her home in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, Maya Angelou celebrated turning 82. Born in an era unfriendly to women whose ambitions would take them out of the home or away from a narrow range of ""acceptable"" jobs, she nonetheless succeeded in many fields. She has led an admirably peripatetic life; she has been an author, dancer, actor, civil rights activist, radio host. Hailed, above all, for her vivid written portrayals of adolescent life in the South and the horrors of her violent childhood, she's become a role model of resilience for generations of American women. When she speaks, it is with intense clarity, as if her words are aligned, standing at attention. Untethered from convention and politesse by age, hard-won experience and inner strength, she expresses truths that many women may suspect but are loath to admit. ""I love to see a young girl go out and grab the world by the lapels,"" she once said. ""Life's a bitch. You've got to go out and kick a--."" But 41 years after the she grabbed those lapels with her groundbreaking novel ""I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,"" I found myself reflecting at her party on what has -- and has not -- changed for women heading out into the world. The truth is, it's still very hard to get to the point of accomplishment of a Maya Angelou. Modern women still struggle to succeed without being labeled the witch, ditz or office pariah. Indeed, young women I meet when I speak with college students across the country are aware of this as they prepare to plunge into their adult lives. I find that regardless of the career opportunities that are at their fingertips, advances that their foremothers would scarcely have believed, some women (especially women of color) still brace themselves for limitations and obstacles. Is there a magic key to a life lived free of gender and racial biases, they ask? There is not. There are barriers. But how long must young women leaving high schools and universities expect to be swimming against generations-long waves? We have come a long way, but still we see reflected in the media daily the crude stereotypes that confront and trivialize accomplished and prominent women. It might be a first lady mocked for revealing a little cleavage, another first lady questioned for leaving her job to take care of her children or a candidate for vice president criticized for her commitment to family. And though women represent more than half the voting age population and are a significant political force, at this ""post-feminist"" moment, only six of the nation's 50 governors and only 17 of the 100 U.S. senators are women. At the same time, the U.S. Census Bureau's 2009 Educational Attainment Survey showed that more women than men over the age of 25 have bachelor's, graduate and professional degrees. And a recent AdAge White Paper, entitled ""The New Female Consumer,"" cited statistics from a Catalyst survey that shows that women's median income rose 32.9 percent from 1990 to 2006, while men's only rose 6.3 percent. Should we be surprised how young women respond to these mixed messages? I talked with Angelou about such issues when she welcomed me as a guest on her program and later invited me to her home to discuss themes about womanhood that I would eventually explore in a book. We talked about how the limitations placed on us as young girls began with our families. I still bristle, and told her so, about how my family had advised me to learn to type and become a secretary. She counseled that they had done that out of love, that their intention was not ""to break you."" Rather, the intent was ""to keep you from breaking your heart."" But as we all know, the world can be much crueler than our families: The route to success for women, politically, economically and personally, is often lined with broken hearts and humbling moments that I would hope do more to ignite our determination than quell it. Maybe we can argue that our defeats kindle resilience? I wonder if Angelou's living legacy reaches today into the lives of modern women whose intelligence, determination--and resilience--helped them surmount obstacles on the way to lofty positions in the world. Yes, there are mixed messages everywhere for young women, but then there are the achievements of a Hillary Clinton, a Michelle Obama, a Sarah Palin. Young, determined women willing to push aside the obstacles that a sometimes retrograde culture throws in their way can take inspiration from those women's successes. And as Angelou once said, ""History, despite its wrenching pain, cannot be unlived, but if faced with courage, need not be lived again."" The birthday girl speaks the truth. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Leslie Sanchez.","Leslie Sanchez says Maya Angelou, whose life has inspired many women, has turned 82 .

"(CNN) -- Millions of Americans are currently enthralled with the performance of our USA soccer team in the 2010 FIFA World Cup, as evidenced by the eruption of cheers that went up with when Landon Donovan scored a goal in the final minutes of the match against Algeria. His winning goal has been hailed as a watershed moment in American sports history, and ""futbol"" fans are predicting he will be talked about years from now in the same breath as Hank Aaron, Joe Namath, Bobby Orr and Wilt Chamberlain. Sorry folks, it's just not going to happen, -- despite the praying by CNN's United Nations correspondent, Richard Roth, to make it so. It's not that I detest soccer/futbol, but the reality is that Americans have not taken to the sport. As a native Houstonian, I sport the gear of the Houston Rockets, Texans, Astros and my Texas A&M Aggies (Houston has the largest concentration of Aggies), but the MLS (Major League Soccer) Houston Dynamo didn't make the cut. Every year I hear fans say that ""it's just around the corner"" or ""this is the year"" or ""the moment has arrived"" when soccer is accepted along the lines of football, baseball and basketball. To be honest, even the National Hockey League has suffered immeasurably, and judging by TV ratings, the lack of a major TV deal, and limited stars well-known to non-hockey fans, it's safe to say it is no longer viewed as one of four major team sports. There are myriad reasons why soccer hasn't caught on, but no one can say it's because of the a lack of interest among the nation's youth. Millions of kids nationwide play the sport, from inner cities to the suburbs. Yet once they become teenagers, soccer falls by the wayside and the interest shifts to baseball, football and basketball. There have been several attempts at launching a major professional sports league, and the latest is the MLS, which has been around since 1993. The league has valiantly tried to reach the big time, but it has struggled, largely catering to its small but loyal audience. If you walked into any sports bar in America, and those there had to choose which games to watch, the National Football League, the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, the PGA Tour or the National Hockey League, would all likely win out over MLS. Although I'm not personally a soccer fan, I've watched a few minutes of the World Cup. But it simply hasn't been a ""must see"" for me like the Ryder Cup or even the Olympics. And to be honest, the Olympics is probably the greatest comparison in terms of measuring the interest of soccer to American fans. Every four years we go nuts over our ""amateur"" athletic stars. We cheer wildly when the U.S. bobsled team wins gold; love to see our track stars fly around the oval; and are enthralled with gymnastics. But once the Olympic Games have ended, we store our ""USA! USA!"" chants for four years. I consider myself to be a huge track fan, and would love to see it on TV more, but the reality is that in other parts of the world, track stars are treated like Kobe Bryant and LeBron James. Yet if Usain Bolt walked through a mall anywhere in America, he might get a few stares, but he wouldn't be bombarded with autograph requests for photos, even though he is the Kobe of the track world right now. So soccer/futbol fans worldwide, don't take it as insult that Americans don't worship soccer the way you do. Everyone has their likes and dislikes. That's really just fine. You do you, and we'll do what we do. As for the World Cup, I'll be cheering for the Donovan-led U.S. team to do well, while flipping back and forth to the NFL and NBA cable channels, pining for my two favorite sports to return in the fall. It's just the American in me. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland S. Martin.","Roland Martin says Americans are cheering the success of the U.S. team in World Cup .

"(CNN)  -- Eight children were found in the Florida home of their slain parents, who apparently were the victims of a home invasion, police confirmed to CNN Friday. Byrd and Melanie Billings are seen surrounded by their children. The couple were found shot Thursday night in their Beulah home, said Escambia County Police spokesman Sgt. Ted Roy. One of the parents was shot in the head, he said. Beulah is about 17 miles northwest of Pensacola. The victims were identified as Byrd and Melanie Billings by Jeff Martin, director of the District Medical Examiner's Office. Autopsies have not been completed, he said. The Billings have 16 children; 12 of them adopted, some of whom have special needs, the Pensacola News Journal reported. Nancy Markham, a relative of the family, told CNN affiliate WEAR-TV that her son was inside the Billings' home when the shootings occurred. ""He said that Bud and Melanie had, both of them had been murdered,"" Markham said. Three men dressed in black were seen on surveillance video approaching the property in a late 1970s or early 1980s red van about 7 p.m., authorities say. Emergency personnel and police went to the home Thursday after receiving a call just before 8 p.m. about shots being fired, Roy said. An employee of the couple found their bodies, he said. When police arrived, they discovered the children also in the house, Roy said. The children, who ranged in age from infant to about 11 years old, were unharmed, he said.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- An emotional Karl Rove characterized his tenure in the White House as a ""witness to history"" as he announced his resignation as President Bush's senior political adviser at the end of this month. Rove and President Bush embrace after Rove announced his resignation. ""It seems the right time to start thinking about the next chapter in our family's life,"" Rove said, his voice breaking. ""It's not been an easy decision."" Speaking to reporters outside the White House with Bush at his side, Rove said discussions about his departure began last summer. ""It always seemed there was a better time to leave, somewhere out there in the future. But now is the time."" He told Bush he would be ""your fierce and committed advocate on the outside."" Bush said Rove ""is movin' on down the road,"" and added, ""I'll be on the road behind you here in a little bit."" The two men have known each other for decades. Rove said they have been friends for 34 years.  Watch how Rove might influence the 2008 presidential election » . Rove, who has held a top position in the White House since Bush took office in January 2001, is to stand down on August 31. Rove said earlier Monday that his resignation was not forced and that he plans to spend his post-White House career writing a book and teaching. Perhaps Bush's most powerful White House aide, Rove submitted his resignation to Bush on Friday, he told CNN's Suzanne Malveaux in an e-mail. Told that there are some who say he's being ""run out of town,"" Rove responded, ""That sounds like the rooster claiming to have called up the sun."" Though Rove has been praised as a political mastermind, that image was tarnished last year, when he insisted Republicans would hold onto both houses of Congress in the midterm elections. Democrats won control of both chambers. And despite successes on Bush's domestic agenda, Rove failed to engineer a winning strategy on immigration reform after the midterm elections. Rove has been subpoenaed to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee investigating the firings of some U.S. attorneys, but the White House said Rove, as an ""immediate adviser"" to the president, cannot be ordered to testify. Sen. Patrick Leahy, the committee's chairman, issued a statement following Rove's announcement saying Rove has ""acted as if he was above the law."" Leahy added, ""There is a cloud over this White House, and a gathering storm. A similar cloud envelops Mr. Rove, even as he leaves the White House."" Rove did testify before a federal grand jury about the leak of CIA operative Valerie Plame's identity after Plame's husband, former ambassador Joe Wilson, became a critic of the war in Iraq. I. Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby, who was Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of staff, was later convicted of lying and obstructing justice. Bush commuted Libby's sentence. Libby's attorneys contended that Libby was the victim of a White House conspiracy to protect Rove but never presented any evidence to support that claim. Journalist Robert Novak, who identified Plame in a 2003 column, testified that Rove was one of two officials who leaked Plame's identity to him, but Rove was never charged with a crime. His departure comes as Bush continues to face low approval ratings and as Republican presidential hopefuls work to differentiate themselves from Bush. The resignation sparked speculation over whether Rove will soon join the campaign of a GOP candidate. But a Wall Street Journal article on Monday in which news of Rove's pending resignation came out said Rove will ""offer advice, if asked, but at 56 years old says he is done with political consulting."" Other White House officials who left after the election include White House counselor Dan Bartlett, budget director Rob Portman, chief White House attorney Harriet Miers, political director Sara Taylor and deputy national security adviser J.D. Crouch. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld left his job immediately following the election, as the Iraq war's influence on voters became clear. Senior administration officials said White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolten recently told senior aides if you're staying after Labor Day, plan to stay for the remainder of the term, so make decisions now, which forced Rove to make his decision. After the announcement, Bush and Rove were headed to the president's ranch in Crawford, Texas. Rove intends to return to Washington over the weekend, according to a White House official. Rove said the first thing he plans to do after leaving the White House is ""go dove hunting in West Texas with family and friends, then drive my wife and the dogs to the beach."" A senior administration official described Rove's agony over the decision, and how ""he and his family struggled"" over it and why ""this is as good a time as any."" ""You're never going to replace him,"" said another senior administration official, adding that Rove served a ""unique role."" ""It's up to [White House Chief of Staff] Josh [Bolten] whether he'll be replaced,"" the official said. Rove plans to write a book about his days with Bush and eventually teach politics on the university level. ""Obviously it's a big loss to us,"" said deputy White House press secretary Dana Perino. ""He is a great colleague, good friend and a brilliant mind."" Bush nicknamed Rove ""the architect"" for creating the plan that won the White House in 2000 and 2004.

"London (CNN) -- I am pleased and relieved that the court in Paris finally found in my favor this week in my case against Google. With hundreds of pages of court documents, mainly generated by Google lawyers, you would have thought my case against them was complicated. It's not. The point is very simple. It concerns nine illegally acquired pictures which courts in the UK and France have previously ruled should not be shown. If someone posts one of these pictures somewhere in the world, Google's search engine will automatically find and display it. However Google will take the picture and its link down whenever they are asked to do so. As they themselves say, they have done this many times for me and for others. The problem is that having removed a picture following receipt of notice from me, their search simply replaces the picture with another taken from a different webpage. The images, which I fought so hard to establish were illegal, continually reappear courtesy of Google. Given that they are prepared to take a specific illegal picture down manually once it has been identified, why not do so automatically? They have the software to recognize specific pictures. Indeed they make the tool freely available on their homepage. So why not use it? They know exactly which pictures are involved because we have repeatedly identified them. All I was asking was that, automatically rather than manually, they stop displaying these specific and known pictures and providing links to them. This seemed to me an obvious and simple request. It is what the French court has now ordered them to do. It also seemed to me to be in Google's own interest. Surely they would not want the trouble of dealing manually with endless take-down requests when they already had the software to identify specific images and could block them automatically. Was this not exactly the sort of thing computers do and Google are particularly good at? It is very difficult to understand why Google should fight tooth and nail to resist doing automatically something they are fully prepared to do manually. To begin with, Google argued that they didn't have the software. Then they said, OK, they could develop the software but there was some great principle involved in blocking a picture, notwithstanding that they must already do this for indecent images of children and other illegal images and information. Then they said it might inadvertently block something legitimate -- obvious nonsense given that we are dealing with a small number of specific pictures. Then they tried to mix this up with cases where a person wanted something objectionable removed without a court decision. Then they suggested we were asking them to exercise judgment - again obvious nonsense given the court decisions that already existed about these specific pictures. Finally, they claimed they were defending free speech. But it's the courts which said the pictures were illegal and should not be shown, so the issue is the rule of law, not freedom of speech. I think that there is something seriously wrong with the culture at Google. The technical side is brilliant and extremely useful. There are some extraordinarily gifted people working on the technical side and coming up with ideas and then the software to exploit them. Yet the non-technical management, particularly in the legal department, seems to be irrational to the point of becoming adolescent. It's almost as if they refuse to do something entirely sensible, and which would save them and others time and trouble, for no better reason than that someone asked them to. In the end, it's about obeying the law and having respect for the rule of law. There is absolutely nothing wrong with observing the law automatically, quite the reverse. There must be some rational people at the top of Google. You would expect them to respect the rights of the individual once established in a court of law. They should insist their legal department do the same. But you may be wondering why I decided to fight the case when it was obvious the primary result would be to draw attention to precisely those pictures I wanted to get rid of. There are two reasons. First, unless the pictures are blocked automatically, I or my lawyers will have to monitor the web in perpetuity. Second, the principle that an individual is able to rely on the rule of law to enforce his or her rights is, I think, of fundamental importance. This should apply no matter who is the opponent or what their business. I hope that this judgment helps establish that principle in respect of online publications and that it may be of use to others in the future.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Few items are more highly prized among collectors of historical artifacts than a handwritten letter from President Lincoln. This letter from President Lincoln to Treasury Secretary Salmon Chase has been returned to the government. Now, there's one fewer in circulation. An Arizona collector handed over to the federal government Thursday a rare handwritten letter from Lincoln to Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase. The letter, dated four days before Lincoln delivered the Gettysburg Address in 1863, had been missing for more than 60 years. Federal officials, who have not ruled out its possible theft from a government collection, discovered it two years ago during routine monitoring of online auctions. They have been negotiating for its return ever since. In the short note, torn from the center of a bound volume, Lincoln tells Chase to do a small favor on behalf of someone recently fired from his job with the federal government. ""Mr. (Robert) Stevens, late Superintendent of the Mint at San Francisco, asks to have a copy, or be permitted to examine, and take extracts, of the evidence upon which he was removed,"" Lincoln writes. ""Please oblige him in one way or the other."" Larry Cutler, a former prosecutor who collects artifacts ranging from Greek antiquities to presidential documents, said he had owned the document for several years and considers it a ""cornerstone"" example of Lincoln's compassion. Stevens, according to Cutler, was ""a guy who was let go or lost his position or otherwise fired, and he wanted to look at his personnel file to find the reasons why he was let go."" But officials at the National Archives suggested that there was more involved than just Lincoln's well-known practice of personally responding to letters from constituents. Jim Hastings, a senior official at the Archives, said Lincoln was taking care of some political business even as the Civil War raged. Stevens was the brother-in-law of Sen. Edward Baker of Oregon, a close colleague of Lincoln's when the two practiced law in Illinois. Baker, who was politically influential in the western United States, was killed in the Civil War two years before Lincoln requested the favor for Stevens. Hastings said ""this document shows his regard for the senator. It shows his interest, even in the midst of the Civil War, in political issues on the West Coast. ... It's quite important."" Cutler said his nature as a prosecutor made him question government officials when they first sought to retrieve the letter, which had been in private hands for decades. Initially, according to Cutler, an investigator reached him on his cell phone and asked him to just send the document back by registered mail. ""I don't work like that,"" Cutler said. He said, ""it took them quite a while to prove to me it was once theirs."" Cutler asked them this month whether he ""could see the volume that they claimed held the other half of the letter."" ""They opened it up, and it didn't match,"" he said. ""My half of the letter was not the same size of the half they have."" Cutler was later convinced, however, when investigators showed how an untrimmed edge matched the torn remains in the volume, along with other evidence they felt established the source of Cutler's document. He declined to say how much he paid for the Lincoln letter at an auction in 2006 but said a similar document in the president's handwriting is currently for sale at an asking price of $78,000. With television cameras, reporters and photographers capturing the moment, Cutler handed the formerly lost Lincoln letter to a National Archives official. ""Here it is,"" he said. ""I appreciate the opportunity"" to donate it during the bicentennial of Lincoln's birth. CNN's Alan Silverleib contributed to this report .","Rare handwritten letter is from Lincoln to Treasury Secretary Chase .

"(CNN) -- Three-year-old Alexis Martin reads at a fifth-grade level. She taught herself fluent Spanish using her parents' iPad. ""From 12 to 18 months old, we'd be driving around in the car, and she would recite her bedtime story from the night before,"" her dad, Ian, told CNN affiliate KNXV. ""She didn't just recite them; she recited them exactly."" Alexis is the youngest member of Arizona's Mensa chapter. American Mensa (PDF) is an organization for people with IQs in the top 2%. The average IQ is 100. Martin's tops 160. Mensa has more than 55,000 members nationally. You'd probably recognize some of the more famous ones: Nolan Gould, who plays Luke on ABC's ""Modern Family""; Richard Bolles, the author of ""What Color is Your Parachute?""; the Blue Power Ranger (OK, he's a fictional member). But what does an IQ score really tell us about a person? Will Alexis be a genius for life? And if you still can't speak Spanish at age 50, should you just give up? What your IQ score means . An Intelligence Quotient, or IQ, is a measure of what psychologists call our ""fluid and crystallized intelligence."" Put simply, an IQ test measures your reasoning and problem-solving abilities. There are different kinds of IQ tests, but most analyze your visual, mathematical and language abilities as well as your memory and information processing speed. A licensed psychologist administers a series of subtests; the results are then combined into one score: your IQ. ""Anybody with very high IQ, they have the ability to manipulate, process and interpret information at a deeper level and a higher speed than the average person,"" explained Mensa's gifted youth specialist, Lisa Van Gemert. What your specific numerical score means depends on the test you take. IQ is really a measure of how well you do on a test compared with other people your age. Scores are generally shown on a bell curve. The average score is 100. People to the far left or far right of the curve are outliers. Alexis, for example, is on the far right of the curve for children her age. Bleacher Report: How smart are you? Take the Wonderlic test and find out . What it doesn't mean . ""The difficulty with these kinds of tests is that they're a snapshot,"" Van Gemert said. ""We see what the kid looks like on this day, on this particular test, with this particular tester."" An IQ score doesn't measure your practical intelligence: knowing how to make things work, says Richard Nisbett, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan. It doesn't measure your creativity. It doesn't measure your curiosity. It doesn't tell your parents or teachers about your emotional readiness. Maybe as a 5-year-old, you can read and understand The Economist. But are you prepared to deal with stories about war-torn countries or prisoners on death row? It would be a mistake, Van Gemert says, to look at a child with a high IQ as nothing more than a brain. Like any trait -- blue eyes, big feet -- their IQ is just one part of who they are. Your IQ can change over time . A lot of factors can affect your IQ score over time. Poverty. Nutrition. Stress. How familiar you are with standardized tests. Nisbett's research has shown that children from lower socioeconomic levels adopted into a middle-class family often increase their IQ scores by 15 to 20 points. ""Heritability is not as great as some people (believe),"" Nisbett said. ""Environmental factors are very potent."" In one study, researchers tested 33 adolescents' intelligence once and then again four years later. In that short amount of time, some of their IQ scores varied by more than 20 points. The changes matched with structural and functional changes in their brains. Kids who are geniuses at age 2 rarely stay that way, experts say. It's easier, Van Gemert explains, for young children to distinguish themselves on the curve. In other words, it's easy to spot a genius 3-year-old when she's reading at a fifth-grade level and speaks fluent Spanish. But what makes one 47-year-old more intelligent than another? Is it education? Life experience? Their ability to put together a piece of furniture from IKEA? You're smarter than your ancestors . Since the early 1990s, when IQ tests were first standardized, researchers have seen substantial increases in IQ scores with each passing generation. So the average 10-year-old today would score higher on the same test than a 10-year-old from 1954. This doesn't mean we necessarily have bigger brains than our great-great-grandfathers; it just means we've improved our abilities to think logically, solve problems and/or use our abilities in hypothetical situations. It's known as the Flynn Effect, for moral philosopher James Flynn. ""The cars that people drove in 1900 have altered because the roads are better and because of technology,"" Flynn said in a TED Talk last year. ""And our minds have altered, too. We've gone from people who confronted a concrete world and analyzed that world primarily in terms of how much it would benefit them to people who confront a very complex world."" For instance, education has changed. We've learned to classify the world, to compare groups like animals or modes of transportation, Flynn said. We've also been taught to accept hypothetical situations (you remember algebra, right?). Our ancestors dealt only with what was right in front of them. Our jobs have also changed. In the early 1900s, only 3% of Americans had professions that were ""cognitively demanding,"" Flynn said. Today, 35% of us do. As such we're used to solving complex, hypothetical problems, like the ones on an IQ test. Health factors may have had an influence as well. Studies have shown that early childhood immunization rates are a big predictor of a nation's average IQ score. So decreasing infectious diseases worldwide may have attributed to the overall increase in subsequent generations' IQ scores. ""From an energetics standpoint, a developing human will have difficulty building a brain and fighting off infectious diseases at the same time, as both are very metabolically costly tasks,"" the authors of one study wrote. Not a genius? Don't panic . You probably remember the dreaded SAT or ACT test you took in high school. That's a type of IQ test. But Nisbett believes that a student's grade-point average is a better predictor of their success than their test scores. ""GPA is raw smarts times how hard you work times self-control times a lot of other things. That's true for success in life,"" he said. ""I see graduate students with extremely high IQs who can't achieve much because they're lacking in curiosity. ...They're lacking the ability to get along with people."" Having a high IQ is not a guarantee of success, Van Gemert agrees, just as having a lower IQ is not a guarantee of failure. Good habits, perseverance and a strong work ethic are just as important as intelligence. ""If you don't develop those other qualities, you can waste a smart IQ,"" she said. Van Gemert recommends that parents view their homes as a petri dish, one where they're trying to grow their children. That means lots of time spent together, interacting, and lots of books, building blocks and board games. ""The most important thing we can do for kids is to play with them,"" she said.","IQ is a measure of your reasoning and problem-solving abilities .
Your score reflects how well you did on a series of tests compared with others your age .
Your IQ can change over time, and scores have improved between generations .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Nearly a dozen insurgents and a U.S. contractor were killed when a group launched an early morning attack on Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan on Wednesday, officials said. Nine service members were wounded and a building received minor damages during the attack, which included rockets, small arms and grenades. Four of the slain insurgents were ""intended suicide bombers,"" the military said. U.S. Army spokesman Lt. Col. Clarence Count Jr. said the insurgents failed ""to breach the perimeter"" and were ""unable to detonate their suicide vests."" ""The quick defensive reaction by the Bagram security forces likely saved a lot of lives,"" he said. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack. Zabiullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, told CNN that 20 armed men wearing suicide vests stormed the base around 4 a.m. (7:30 p.m. Tuesday ET), with four them detonating at the entrances to allow the other men to move in. Mujahid said that a ""major firefight"" took place inside the base. Army Specialist Christina Dion, a spokeswoman who both lives and works on the base, said personnel were ordered to bunkers when the base came under attack and were allowed to return to their huts and tents about 90 minutes later. ""We're always prepared to deal with attacks on our base,"" Counts said. ""The response this morning was immediate."" The fighting eventually tapered off about 7:30 a.m. local time, said NATO spokesman Lt. Col Todd Breasseale. Another Bagram spokeswoman, Maj. Virginia McCabe, could not say if flights into and out of the air base had been stopped and said that authorities are investigating how the incident started. ""Established security procedures are in place,"" she said, adding that personnel with ""mission-essential"" responsibilities were continuing to work. Bagram is a heavily fortified base, its perimeter guarded by high fences and thick, concrete walls. Dion said she didn't believe anyone could have made their way into the main portion of the base. Taliban fighters have lobbed rockets into the base in previous attacks. CNN's Adam Levine and Paula Hancocks contributed to this report.","Nearly 12 insurgents, 1 U.S. contractor killed in attack on Bagram Air Base .

"(CNN) -- Customs officials in Australia have cried fowl after searching a airline traveler -- and allegedly finding two live pigeons stuffed in his tights. Customs officials in Australia allege that a man tried to smuggle pigeons hidden in his tights. The 23-year-old man was stopped at Melbourne International Airport Sunday after arriving on a flight from Dubai, Australia's Customs and Border Protection service said in a statement posted on its Web site. The service alleges that two eggs were found inside a multivitamin container carried by the passenger, who comes from Melbourne. A further search revealed that he was wearing tights -- with a live bird stashed down each leg. Photographs show the birds appear to have been rolled in newspaper and polythene with only their heads showing. The images indicate that one bird was attached to each of the alleged smuggler's lower legs. Customs officials also claim that plant seeds were found in the man's moneybelt and undeclared eggplant in his baggage. ""Wildlife smuggling is not only cruel to the animals involved, it poses a severe risk to the Australian environment and the health of the Australian community,"" said Richard Janeczko, Customs and Border Protection National Manager Investigations. ""It is important that people declare all animal and plant materials to Customs and Border Protection when they enter Australia,"" Janeczko added. The service said that the maximum penalty for wildlife smuggling is 10 years imprisonment and/or a A$110,000 ($70,000) fine.","Customs officers stopped 23-year-old man as he returned from Dubai .

"(CNN) -- We've been nearing the end of the late-fees era for years -- and, thanks to technology, we're one step closer this week. Amazon just launched a no-fees library loan program for digital books. This shift actually started more than a decade ago with the DVD-rental business. Or, more specifically, when Reed Hastings, now the CEO of Netflix (er, Qwikster?), forgot to return a copy of the movie ""Apollo 13"" for six weeks and racked up a $40 late fee from a video-rental store. That inspired his DVD-by-mail service, according to a 2006 essay in The New York Times, in which customers pay a monthly fee for the privilege to leave ""Romy and Michele's High School Reunion"" under their couches for as long as they'd like without financial penalty. Ba-da-bing. No more late fees. (Customers still gripe about Netflix's prices, though). Now, books are the next frontier. Sure, there have been previous no-tech attempts to waive library fees. Some book-loaners have programs called ""Amnesty Week,"" in which good-willed librarians let anyone return an overdue book -- no questions asked. Last year, someone brought a 35-years-overdue book back to a library during one of these events. The fine otherwise would have been $1,400, according to Time. In other cases, the fees to be charged were so hefty that libraries just decide to give up. In Oakland, Jim Pavon returned a 78-years-overdue copy of a Rudyard Kipling book, according to a 2005 story in The San Francisco Chronicle. ""Stunned library officials agreed to waive the late fees,"" the paper says, ""which under the 1927 rate of 2 cents per day would have amounted to more than $550 by now."" Digital books allow for a different approach. Instead of charging owners for overdue e-books, the files just lock up on the borrower's e-book reader or smartphone. ""E-books automatically expire,"" said David Burleigh, a spokesman for a company called OverDrive, which is managing this library book-loaning program for Amazon and has apps that work for other e-reading platforms. ""So that definitely is a benefit from borrowing e-books. And you don't have to go back and forth to the library. You can do it remotely."" That's good for forgetful types, who can stash books away from weeks or decades before remembering they've borrowed them. And it's good for libraries, too, since they can loan these books out again right away -- rather than waiting for them to be returned. ""It's fantastic,"" said Carrie Russell, director of the American Library Association's program on public access to information. The fact that libraries don't charge late fees on overdue e-books isn't a big deal, she said. ""Having been a librarian, the libraries don't really rely on late fees as a big budget boost,"" she said. ""It's negligible. It doesn't matter to us if we don't collect late fees. We'd rather the information gets out to people."" Most digital book ""rentals"" last for two weeks. Libraries purchases a certain number of licenses for the digital books, and then lend those out to patrons. So it's not like the library can loan out 1,000 copies of ""The Help"" just because that book is popular. That's a good start, but is based on the ""print model,"" Russell said. In the future, she expects new ""Netflix models"" for books to emerge, where libraries pay monthly fees to publishers, perhaps, and can lend out as many copies of a book as their patrons would like. Amazon is in talks to do that for consumers, according to The Wall Street Journal. ""Customers would pay an annual fee to access a library of content"" under the potential plan, that paper says. The Amazon program is the largest so far, with 11,000 libraries participating, all of those in the United States only. That sounds like a lot, but it's only 9% of the libraries in the country, according to data from the American Library Association. The rest of the country may have to keep sweating overdue book fees. But perhaps not for too much longer.","New program lets libraries lend e-books to Kindle users .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Keya Morgan sometimes sleeps with Abraham Lincoln's pocket watch clutched in his hand or with Marilyn Monroe's dress next to him. It makes for amazing dreams, he says. It also puts Morgan -- owner of a vast array of historical photos, documents and objects -- at the nexus of celebrity, conspiracy and collectibles. He's friends with an unusual array of famous people, many of whom he met while gathering his artifacts and information. Michael Jackson was among them. Marina Oswald still is. The widow of the man accused of assassinating President John F. Kennedy says she's spent hours discussing history with Morgan, who owns the largest private collection of photos of JFK. ""Keya is a good kid. Let's put it that way,"" Oswald said. ""He has a good heart, and he's compassionate and puts all his 150% in it."" Although she rarely gives interviews, Oswald felt strongly enough about her friendship with Morgan that she agreed to speak with CNN by phone from her Texas home. ""I am very pleased to know Keya,"" Oswald said. The admiration is mutual. ""Marina Oswald is one of the most intelligent, amazing women I know,"" Morgan said, adding that he's ""100% positive"" her husband, Lee Harvey Oswald, did not mastermind Kennedy's death. In addition to being a collector, Morgan is a historian and filmmaker -- and will become an author in the spring when his book, ""Marilyn Monroe: Murder on Fifth Helena Drive,"" is scheduled to be published. He interviewed more than 300 people during a decade of research, including FBI agents, the coroner who conducted Monroe's autopsy, the Los Angeles police detectives who investigated her death and two of Monroe's three husbands. Morgan claims that his book will prove the movie star was murdered. ""I feel so fortunate to be able to live alongside of history,"" Morgan said. ""History is like a drug to me. I get a total high."" Morgan's addiction, which began at New York estate sales at age 8, soon grew into a business. He was a teenager operating a collectibles shop in Manhattan in the mid-1990s when he met a new client and friend. ""A guy with a mask and a hood walks into my shop,"" Morgan said. ""It scared the living daylights out of me. I knew I was going to be robbed."" A customer who was selling gold coins to Morgan fled in fright, but when the masked man spoke, Morgan realized it was Michael Jackson. The pop icon, a well-known buyer of historical artifacts, was searching for prints of Elvis Presley and Marilyn Monroe, Morgan said. Jackson returned several times to the shop he called ""a little Smithsonian on 25th Street,"" Morgan said. Jackson called Morgan a ""time traveler"" because of his passion for artifacts, ranging from his statuette from King Tut's tomb to Muhammad Ali's personal writings. When Morgan gave Jackson a ring that once belonged to Monroe, Jackson returned the favor by teaching him his trademark dance step. ""He actually taught me the Moonwalk in my shop,"" Morgan said, adding that he can still do the move. Morgan later became close friends with real moonwalker Buzz Aldrin, the second man to step onto the lunar surface. ""I always pride myself in going straight to the source,"" he said. Another celebrity friend is Donald Trump Jr., the son of the real estate mogul and ""Apprentice"" host. ""Keya is one of these guys who was perhaps born 100 years too late,"" Trump said. ""He's a timeless character living in a modern world."" One aspect of Morgan's personality that helps him make and keep celebrity friends is he is ""that rare friend who isn't the clingy, needy friend,"" Trump said. Now in his 30s -- he won't reveal his exact age -- Morgan owns Queen Victoria's family album, a large collection of Adolf Hitler photos and the largest private collection of photos of Abraham Lincoln. His extensive photography collection also includes images of Fredrick Douglass and several Civil War generals, as well as rare photos of slaves. Morgan says the relationships he develops while researching historical photos pays off, such as when Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's great-great-grandson told him about an image in a family-owned album that showed Lincoln in front of the White House weeks before he was assassinated. Unlike most other Lincoln images, Morgan said, this was an unstaged photo captured after the photographer convinced a young Tad Lincoln to ask his father to step outside. Morgan calls it ""the first act of paparazzi photography."" President Obama was a U.S. senator from Illinois in 2005 when he called Morgan to ask for permission to use one of his photos of Lincoln -- made just two months before his death -- for a column for Time magazine titled, ""What I See in Lincoln's Eyes."" ""On trying days, the portrait, a reproduction of which hangs in my office, soothes me; it always asks me questions,"" Obama wrote. At Obama's suggestion, Morgan created a website, LincolnImages.com, to make his catalog of historical photos available to the public for licensing, he said. Until Morgan disappeared into a Los Angeles condo this year to finish the last chapters of his book on Monroe, he could be found at the Beverly Hills Hotel Polo Lounge or West Hollywood's Chateau Marmont, socializing with an impressive list of celebrity friends. Morgan says they're often his biggest customers, too. ""Historical people appreciate history even more than anybody,"" Morgan said. Morgan was lunching at the Polo Lounge with veteran screenwriter David Seidler just days before he won an Oscar for ""The King's Speech."" Morgan gave Seidler an original photograph of King George VI sitting with President Franklin Roosevelt in June 1939. The photo, part of a collection of Queen Victoria's family photos Morgan purchased at auction, was taken three months before the king delivered the dramatic radio address featured in Seidler's screenplay. When Mariah Carey paid $662,000 for Monroe's childhood piano, Morgan said, he gave the singer a rare photo of Monroe sitting at the keyboard. Morgan's longtime obsession with Monroe took an eerie twist when he moved into his west L.A. condo to write. He didn't realize fate had put him two blocks from her grave. ""When my doorman told me Marilyn was around the corner, I was totally shocked,"" he said. Morgan visited Monroe's grave almost every morning while he wrote to ""say a prayer for strength to do justice to her."" ""Marilyn Monroe is the most misunderstood character in history,"" he said. ""She is as American as apple pie, and she was sweeter than honey."" One chapter in his book, titled ""Dumb Blonde Genius,"" will prove that ""she was a prodigy, not a dumb blonde,"" Morgan said. ""Marilyn Monroe went from being the most poor, unwanted girl tossed from all these orphanages to the most desired sex goddess, movie goddess, highest-earning actress in the world when she died in 1962,"" he said. ""She did that all by herself. She created this magical character."" Morgan's knowledge of Monroe's life is enhanced by his friendships with two of her husbands, James Dougherty and Arthur Miller. He never knew husband Joe DiMaggio, but he bought much of the Yankees slugger's estate, giving Morgan access to the couple's personal letters. After the book is published, Morgan says, he will concentrate on a film ""to prove once and for all that she was murdered."" A key part of Morgan's book focuses on Monroe's relationship with Kennedy and his brother Robert F. Kennedy. Morgan owns the only known photo of the three together, taken in May 1962 after the actress' famous ""Happy Birthday"" serenade to the president. Morgan boasts the largest private collection of JFK photos, thanks in large part to his recent purchase of the archives of former White House photographer Cecil Stoughton. Most of the 20,000 images have never been seen beyond the day Stoughton printed them in his darkroom five decades ago. While Morgan's business is to license or sell from his historical collections, much of what he owns is not for sale. Instead, he keeps them for personal enjoyment, such as his ""time traveling"" dreams. ""I take a historical object, like a watch that belonged to Lincoln, and I sleep with it,"" Morgan said. ""I pray to God and to Lincoln to sort of guide me. And when I sleep, I have a dream about it. Now, it could either be my subconscious that's doing that, or it could be my soul traveling time."" During one dream experienced while holding Lincoln's watch, Morgan said, he found himself standing among Lincoln Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, Secretary of State William Seward and the president's family. ""I remember Mary Lincoln, how nasty she was, and she was full of herself,"" Morgan said. ""I remember the kids. I remember his son Willie was the cutest kid."" He's dreamed with Monroe's watch, her dress and even a piece of her dog's toy. ""I had one dream, actually, in which she was towards the end of her life, and she had gotten her contract for $1 million, and she was so extremely happy,"" he said. He went shopping with Monroe in another dream. One night, Morgan counted eight trips through time using a variety of artifacts. After more than two decades of collecting, he can choose from King Tut's 3,000-year-old ""servant of the hereafter"" ushabti statuette, a 2,200-year-old Alexander the Great coin, 24-karat earrings from Cleopatra's time, Thomas Edison's pen, Marlon Brando's wristwatch or a wide array of artifacts from all 44 U.S. presidents.","Keya Morgan collects historical artifacts from celebs .

"(CNN) -- Rep. Leonard Boswell, D-Iowa, and his family were victims of a home invasion at their rural farmhouse outside Lamoni, Iowa, over the weekend. An intruder entered the home Saturday night through the front door, physically assaulted Boswell's daughter, and demanded money at gunpoint, a statement from the congressman's office said. Hearing his daughter's screams, the 77-year-old Boswell -- who served two terms in Vietnam -- tussled with the intruder to try to yank the weapon from him, the office said. The incident ended when Boswell's 22-year-old grandson grabbed a gun from another room and pointed it at the intruder -- sending him running into the woods, said Jane Slusark, the congressman's spokeswoman. ""When you see one of the people that you love very much, you see they're in that kind of danger, why you have to do something. You gotta do something,"" Boswell told reporters Monday. Other than a few scrapes and bruises, the eight-term congressman and his family were unharmed, Slusark said. Local, state and federal authorities are investigating the incident. The FBI is assisting in the investigation, FBI spokeswoman Sandra Breault said. Boswell represents Iowa's 3rd District.

"(CNN) -- We may be coming upon a new era for the Internet search. Google dominates the search world, but some sites are trying to expand the possibilities. And, despite what you may think, Google is not the only player. New search engines that are popping up across the Web strive to make searches faster, smarter, more personal and more visually interesting. Some sites, like Twine and hakia, will try to personalize searches, separating out results you would find interesting, based on your Web use. Others, like Searchme, offer iTunes-like interfaces that let users shuffle through photos and images instead of the standard list of hyperlinks. Kosmix bundles information by type -- from Twitter, from Facebook, from blogs, from the government -- to make it easier to consume. Wolfram Alpha, set to launch Monday, is more of an enormous calculator than a search: It crunches data to come up with query answers that may not exist online until you search for them. And sites like Twitter are trying to capitalize on the warp-speed pace of online news today by offering real-time searches of online chatter -- something Google's computers have yet to replicate. Google, of course, remains the search king. Recent efforts to revolutionize Web searching have failed to unseat the dominant California company, which captures nearly 64 percent of U.S. online searches, according to comScore. Tech start-ups like Cuil, which billed itself as more powerful than Google, and Wikia, which relied on a community to rank search results rather than a math formula, have largely faded away after some initial buzz.  Timeline: the history of searching for data » . ""The general trend has been relatively clear and consistent for the past five years: Google is growing its market share at the expense of every other engine,"" said Graham Mudd, vice president for search and social media at comScore, a company that tracks industry trends. The new class of search engines and data calculators enters the fray with those failures in mind, though. Instead of trying to be Google killers, these sites have more humble aspirations: to be alternatives to the industry giants. Real-time searches offer the most promise, Mudd said. If you search Google news, the results will be recent, but not live. That's where Twitter's search comes in. It searches the site's micro-blog posts by the second, allowing users to see what's buzzing on the Web at any instant. Facebook and FriendFeed also are experimenting with real-time searches, according to news reports. But each of these searches operates only within its own social network. Scoopler is another real-time site that's trying to aggregate info from all of these sites. And all of these are seeing more competition, as two new sites -- TweetMeme and OneRiot -- launched new or updated real-time searches on Tuesday. Nova Spivack, a technology developer who writes about search engines, said sites that forecast trendy topics will become more prominent. Knowing what will be trendy tomorrow is becoming valuable to more people, he said. Search trend predictions will be valuable to people interested in news in much the same way as stock forecasts are valuable to financial industry workers. ""The topography of the Web is shifting much faster. Instead of happening kind of glacially, you're on the beach right where the water is coming in and it's constantly changing the way the sand is laid out,"" he said. Other search sites are just trying to get smarter, with some acting as giant data crunchers. The much-talked about Wolfram Alpha, or Alpha for short, harnesses massive computing power to answer users' questions, even if they're never been answered on the Web before.  Watch a Wired editor discuss the site » . ""It's not a new Google. It's not supposed to be. It's a new thing. It's very complementary, in a way, to what search engines do,"" said Theodore Gray, co-founder of Wolfram Research, which created Alpha. People need to get away from the idea that every 3-inch-long search bar online acts just like Google and Yahoo!, he said. If you ask Google a question, the search engine's computers scan the Web for matching search terms and come up with answers that make the most sense statistically. Alpha, by contrast, pulls information from existing data sets that have been approved by the site's math-minded staff. The site then computes an answer to your question. An example will help this make sense. Say you wanted to find out nutritional information for your favorite recipe. On Google, you would have to search each ingredient individually and then add the calories and fat grams together yourself. With Alpha, you can type in the full recipe and the site produces a completed graphic that looks like it came right off the side of a cereal box. Read about a CNN test of 'Alpha' Some search sites are trying to get better at understanding what their users want. Twine, a social site created by Spivack, soon will start incorporating information about its users into a search function, he said. Some of the information comes through a user's search history. The site also will ask users to rank search results by their relevance to your interests. ""Right now, one of the problems with search is that it's really one-size-fits-all. It's not very personalized,"" Spivack said. ""The fact is when I'm searching for certain kinds of things, the way that the results should be ranked might quite be different than if someone with a very different background or interests was searching for those same things."" So if you're someone who is into heavy science, a search about evolution might yield more academic papers. If you're a person whose Web interests lean more toward pop culture, an evolution search might turn up photos and more basic information. Helping computers understand the information that's online is the next step in making searches more personal, Spivack said. It's unclear which companies, if any, will be able to accomplish this, but Google appears to be working on that problem as well as others. At an event on Tuesday, Google announced a new ""show options"" feature as part of its search. Users can use the function to see new ways search results are linked, such as through timelines or a ""Wonder Wheel,"" which displays visual relationships between search terms. And in a staff letter published last week on Google's blog, company co-founder Sergey Brin wrote about making searches more intelligent. ""Perfect search requires human-level artificial intelligence, which many of us believe is still quite distant,"" he wrote. ""However, I think it will soon be possible to have a search engine that 'understands' more of the queries and documents than we do today. ""Others claim to have accomplished this, and Google's systems have more smarts behind the curtains than may be apparent from the outside, but the field as a whole is still shy of where I would have expected it to be.""","New search engines try to make searches faster, smarter, more personal .

"(CNN) -- Achievers, raise your White Russian tumblers because this ""Obsessions"" is for you. Do you hate the Eagles? Do you bowl? Compulsively drink White Russians (er, Caucasians)? Is your only form of identification a Ralph's Value Club card? Got a rug that really ties the room together? You're not alone, man. When the Coen brothers' ""The Big Lebowski"" hit theaters in 1998 it was, well, a gutter ball, earning just $17.5 million. The film starred Jeff Bridges as ""The Dude,"" John Goodman as Vietnam vet and Judaism convert Walter, Julianne Moore as feminist artist Maude, Steve Buscemi as loyal pal Donny and John Turturro as bowling rival/pedophile ""The Jesus."" But the Achievers (the fans of the movie) eventually found it, on VHS and then DVD and now Blu-ray, making it the cult phenomenon it is today. It soon inspired the fan-run Lebowski Fest -- an event that takes place in various cities throughout the year. This week, Achievers gathered in New York City for a very special incarnation of Lebowski Fest marking the film's long-awaited Blu-ray release. The event was held at Manhattan's Hammerstein Ballroom. The red carpet was the film's famous stolen rug that ""really tied the room together."" We media folk on the red carpet were a mix of Achievers, and those who really only wanted to talk to Bridges about his new album and to Buscemi about ""Boardwalk Empire."" We abided, and I was lucky enough to be standing next to two guys who debated which fictional porn movie was better: ""Logjammin' "" or ""Gutterballs."" Goodman spoke to CNN on the red carpet. He told us that the line from ""Lebowski"" he is asked to quote most often is, ""Shut the f**k up, Donny."" The actor maintains he had no idea the film would be so highly worshipped by fans. ""Absolutely not,"" said Goodman. ""It's the most fun I ever had working on a film. I never thought about it actually being released."" He also noted that his favorite scene ""Changes all the time. (He laughs.) I like the scene where he's getting grilled by the Malibu police, but really, it changes a lot."" When asked if he is ever as intense as his ""Lebowski"" character, the hot-headed Walter, Goodman said, ""God, I hope not!"" Bridges admitted that he shares some character traits with The Dude, including a laid-back attitude and a fondness for the tunes of Creedence Clearwater Revival. Also, he stated that the clear plastic jelly sandals The Dude wears in ""Lebowski,"" along with some other clothing items, were his own. Red carpet arrivals were followed by a Q&A moderated by Entertainment Weekly's Clark Collis. The panel consisted of Bridges, Goodman, Turturro, Moore, Buscemi and music archivist T Bone Burnett on the Hammerstein's stage. Turturro gave a shout-out to his costume which can best be described as a grape-bubblegum-colored polyester jumpsuit. ""All actors have to credit their costumes,"" joked Turturro, who said that after the film's release he ""got a lot of sex mail."" When Buscemi had the floor, the Achievers shouted, in unison, ""Shut the f**k up, Donny!"" To which the actor replied, ""First of all, YOU shut the f**k up!"" Buscemi said he had the cast sign a bowling ball as a keepsake, and that when he approached actor Sam Elliot (the sarsaparilla-sipping Stranger) for an autograph, the actor replied in his signature folksy voice, ""Man, I don't usually do this."" Moore told the crowd that what attracted her to the film was Maude's unique way of speaking. ""I loved the language,"" said the actress, who joked, ""It's not an accent, it's an affectation."" Moore also told the crowd that her most cherished memento from the set isn't one of the coveted bowling pin hats, it's her 13-year-old son. The actress became pregnant in the middle of filming. After leading the crowd in a yoga-inspired Ohm (Yup, we Ohmed with The Dude), Bridges wrapped up the talk by telling the group what message he hopes people take away from ""The Big Lebowski,"" which just happens to be one of the film's most quotable lines, ""that's just, like, your opinion, man."" ""The Big Lebowski"" is one of those movies where you notice something new during every viewing. For example, did you know the opening scene takes place exactly a decade before 9/11? The next time you watch the film, you'll see that when the Dude purchases a $0.69 carton of half & half, which he pays for by check, the date he writes is September 11, 1991. And, as he's signing the check, President George H.W. Bush is seen giving a speech on the store's little TV set about how aggression against Kuwait ""will not stand."" Strange but true. A screening of the film was held after the Q&A, but the greatest entertainment of the night was by far the Achievers. They showed up in costume, smoked pot in the balcony, sipped White Russians, shouted dialogue (even while the actors were speaking on stage), and frankly, they really tied the room together.","Fans of ""The Big Lebowski"" gathered in New York this week for Lebowski Fest .

"(CNN) -- Instead of shelling out hard-earned cash for a sassy new outfit, dig deep in your inspirational bank for something that fits your personal style as if it were tailor-made. Simple DIY projects easily become insert-your-name-here couture that will turn any day into your own fashion show. ""It's really the best form of self-expression one can have,"" Kirsten Nunez, founder of DIY blog Studs and Pearls, said. ""You're making something that's all you. DIY has influenced people to look at the artistic expression of fashion, rather than the monetary value of it."" If you've ever thought remaking a thrift store find or starting an outfit from scratch was intimidating, never fear -- the fabulous ladies of DIY fashion are here, armed with blogs full of photo-illustrated, step-by-step tutorials, endless inspiration and the confidence that comes from wearing your own design. DIY blogger Jessica Quirk said there are three magic words that can turn her day golden -- ""You made that?"" ""That's my favorite question,"" Quirk said. ""It's just a natural thing for me. Why buy it if you can make it? I love coming back from the fabric store, washing the fabric and whipping something up."" Two kinds of shoppers can benefit from DIY fashion -- the ones who don't want to shell out for designer pieces and those who never find the right fit or style. Quirk, 28, began sewing at age 10. Four years ago, she began taking photos of her outfits on a daily basis. A year later, she began What I Wore, posting daily photos and pointing out the pieces she made. It became part of what is essentially a neighborhood of DIY fashion blogs. Quirk's daily chic ensembles look like the latest trends on the runways or throwbacks to extravagant vintage designs. In reality, the outfits are a combination of DIY, thrift finds and even pieces from more inexpensive stores like Target. ""You don't have to buy expensive things to look good,"" Quirk said. ""Everything I do is something I've conjured up. What looks expensive can end up being a $4 project."" Jenni Radosevich, the mind behind I Spy DIY, also has a monthly column for InStyle Magazine. ""It's the whole idea of crafting something you're proud of,"" Radosevich said. ""I like creating what I can't find and when people find household items and turn them into something else. It's turning something you get at Home Depot into fashion."" DIY tutorials  fill the site. Basing her ideas on designer trends, Radosevich demonstrates step by step how to take something like a plain pair of black oxfords and turn them into a similar Dolce & Gabbana style. Other intriguing posts take up the challenge of converting a feather duster into a stylish purse -- with success. Readers even send in photos of their own versions, and ask things such as, ""I have some extra fringe, what can I create with it?"" ""The whole nature of DIY is finding ways to create things and share it with everyone else,"" Radosevich said. ""DIY has always been around. Now, people are realizing they can blog about it. It's great to see this dialogue about fashion."" Next to Radosevich, no one loves sharing DIY ideas more than Erica Domesek, whose motto is, ""Re-imagine, reuse and reinvent: I see it. I like it. I make it."" Domesek has a website named ""P.S. -- I made this ..."" and has written a book with the same name. Domesek's wants to take the intimidation factor out of DIY and share her creativity with the world. Nothing is impossible to Domesek. If something catches your eye in the store, you can find a way to make it happen on your own, Domesek said. Think about what attracts you to it, and how can you make it. If that leaves you shaking in your thrifty boots, just Google a how-to. Or, look around the house for old clothes and get creative, Domesek said. Domesek's media brand and blog was born of the same desire to create. When a friend told her about a $600 necklace she'd been eyeing, Domesek's craftiness kicked into high gear. ""We can make that,"" she said. During a girls night in, they recreated the necklace for a fraction of the cost. It turned into a monthly craft club. As she began to wear her crafts in public, people would ask about the designs. Her wry, quirky response was always ""P.S., I made this."" ""There's a tiny little Oprah in me that wants to teach people,"" Domesek said. ""It's so easy to make things. What gets me excited is showing people what I make and how to make things, to inspire and educate by reaching an audience."" From sassy hats to ""upscaled"" shoes and everything in between, Domesek covers all of the bases with her easy to follow tutorials. Carly Cais writes the Chic Steals blog, which publishes a weekly round-up of links to easy, fun tutorials from around the Web, as well as her own. Chic Steals started in January 2008 as a weekly column on Fashion Tribes. It has evolved into a blog for all of her writing and DIY projects, plus tutorial links. Her first published project, a man's shirt turned into a dress, was re-posted over the internet numerous times. ""People love taking something normal and making it more chic,"" Cais said. ""There's an emergence of an interest in creating current fashion with what you have in your closet and re-interpreting the runways to your own personal taste."" Cais enjoys looking at impossibly-priced designer collection shows and translating the ensembles into easy-to-make home projects. Just by looking at a photo, Cais can break down a piece into a pattern. DIY blogs express unique voices in the fashion world. Whether just gleaning inspiration from handcrafted ensembles or taking on a weekend project for Monday's power outfit, DIY fashion is both accessible and easy. Domesek recommends starting small.

"(Mashable)  -- First there was baby ""Facebook"" and now this: An Israeli couple has named their kid ""Like."" Let the Valley Girl jokes ensue. The Israeli news source Galgalatz reports that Lior and Vardit Adler are the proud parents of a bouncing baby girl named after the Facebook Like button, which recently celebrated its first birthday. Apparently, the parents were looking to call their daughter something unique. The moniker is not meant to be a gimmick, and they say that they're not shilling for Facebook. They just like (pun intended) the meaning behind the name. The Adlers are hardly the first people to saddle their kid with a suspect name. One man offered to name his son Batman if he could get 500,000 people to become fans of his Facebook Page, and another couple named their child Facebook in honor of the role the social network played in the revolution in Egypt. Granted, naming your child something unusual is not relegated to the realm of social media -- apparently ""Brooklyn"" is an extremely popular name -- but the name choice certainly is out there.

"(EW.com) -- ""The Hunger Games"" movie may not have had trouble earning a PG-13 rating, but many parents and educators are wondering whether the best-selling book trilogy belongs on library shelves. The American Library Association's Office for Intellectual Freedom released its annual list of most frequently challenged books of 2011 yesterday, and the increased popularity of Suzanne Collins' dystopian saga -- in large part fueled by buzz surrounding the blockbuster film -- drove the books higher on the list. In 2010, only the first novel cracked the top ten at number five. In 2011, all three books occupy the number three position, and the complaints have grown more varied: ""anti-ethnic; anti-family; insensitivity; offensive language; occult/satanic; violence."" The ALA keeps track of challenges filed and counted 327 reported attempts to restrict or remove books from schools and libraries in 2011. The association defines a challenge as ""a formal, written complaint filed with a library or school requesting that a book or other material be restricted or removed because of its content or appropriateness."" Barbara Jones, director of the ALA's Office for Intellectual Freedom, told the Associated Press that many of the complaints leveled against ""The Hunger Games"" books focused on the film version directed by Gary Ross. ""There was complaining about the choice of actors for the film,"" she said. ""You had people saying someone was dark-skinned in the book, but not in the film, or dark-skinned in the film and not in the book. In general, a lot more people were aware of the books and that led to more kinds of complaints."" Lauren Myracle, a regular on these types of lists, came in at number one with her epistolary Internet Girl books. But the book that topped the list last year -- ""And Tango Makes Three,"" about two male penguins who raise a baby chick together -- didn't crack the top ten. Jones said she'd like to believe that people are becoming more tolerant of homosexuality, but it may just be that other books are attracting more attention.

"(CNN) -- A Wisconsin man who stumbled across and alerted authorities to a young girl investigators say was kept in a basement, starved and sexually abused, said Tuesday she looked much younger than her 15 years -- ""like she just came from Auschwitz."" Mike Vega of Madison was on his way home from buying milk at the store when he saw what looked to be a girl, ""8 or 9 years old,"" he said, outside, wearing pajamas but no shoes. Temperatures were below freezing. ""I thought that was odd ... So I put the car in reverse and rolled down the window and asked her if she was OK. She said no, she needed help,"" Vega told CNN's Brooke Baldwin. He described picking the girl up, putting her in his car, wrapping her feet in a coat and blasting the heat. ""Her eyes were set back like she was very dehydrated. You could see the bones in her arm ... The only way I could best describe it is she looked like she just came from Auschwitz,"" said Vega. Auschwitz was a concentration camp in Poland operated by the Nazis during World War II. They began to talk. Soon into the conversation, he stepped outside the car, telling the girl he needed to call a friend. He dialed 911. The girl's 18-year-old stepbrother has since been charged with three felony sexual abuse counts. Her 40-year-old father and 42-year-old stepmother have been charged with child abuse and recklessly endangering a child, both felonies, as well as a misdemeanor count of child neglect. CNN's policy is to withhold the names of victims of allegations of sexual abuse and those of their family members. ""Mr. Vega was in the right place, at the right time, and did the right thing,"" said Madison Police Chief Noble Wray. Efforts are under way to establish a fund for the victim, who is being ""well cared for,"" he added. The teenager weighed only 70 pounds when Vega found her on February 6, according to a Madison police report, more than 30 pounds below what the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists as the median for her age. A doctor who examined her described her as a victim of ""serial child torture with prolonged exposure to definite starvation,"" the report states. According to a criminal complaint, investigators learned the girl was kept in the basement of her home with little food and no bathroom. She ran away because she was afraid and upset with her stepmother, who controlled her movements and told her when she could use the bathroom and eat, the complaint reads. It states the girl has gained more than 17 pounds this month, even though doctors have restricted her intake because ""she is gorging so much that she has been throwing up."" When the girl was taken to a hospital, her father ""provided medical explanations for her physical condition,"" the police report reads. But a hospital social worker raised doubts about his account, and investigators learned the girl had been the subject of a prior abuse claim in 2007. The girl did not back up the third-party allegation at that time, and the family did not cooperate with investigators, according to the report.","The 15-year-old weighed 70 pounds when found; she has since gained 17 .

"Amman, Jordan (CNN) -- A large demonstration in downtown Amman on Friday ended peacefully a week after clashes erupted between pro-government and anti-government demonstrators near the Al Husseini Mosque. On Friday, rows of police officers separated pro-government supporters from anti-government protesters. Some in the pro-government march carried a large Jordanian flag and posters of the king. Many in the large group of anti-government protesters, which spanned several blocks, waved Jordanian flags, banners and signs. A small boy held a sign over his head which read, ""No to thugs-Yes to freedom."" Police said four activists were injured last Friday during clashes, one of which involved demonstrators calling for political reform and a group of men with sticks. Some of the protesters say police failed to protect the demonstrators from what they described as an attack. Lt. General Hussein Majali, the public security directorate chief, said there were 20 officers on site last week when the clashes broke out and the reserves -- who were about five minutes away -- were called in and they changed their tactics accordingly. When asked about police intervention during the second incident, Majali said, ""It could have been faster."" During the second clash he said, ""the people came running and the police ran also and even worked to separate them."" Police have tried to maintain a minimum presence during the marches to reduce tensions between police and protesters. Police presence during this week's demonstration increased significantly. The government has called for an investigation into the attacks. Minister of Justice Hussein Mjalli formed a committee that is now conducting an independent investigation into the attacks. Mjalli said that two suspects have been placed under arrest in connection with the case, and warrants have been issued for the arrest of another 11 suspects. This week's protest was the latest in a string of protests throughout the country and came as anti-government protests have spread across the Middle East and north Africa. During Friday's downtown demonstration, at least one pro-government demonstrator, Nedal Dudin, tried to find some common ground between the groups. ""We are here today to prove that we are all Jordanian,"" he said. Meanwhile, the much larger group of anti-government protesters, including a mix of independent activists marching alongside leftists, Baathists, Islamists and youth activists, made it clear the time for change is now. The Popular Unity Party's youth party chief Fakher Da'as said his group wants to see a new elections law within two months, rather than the three-to-nine-month plan the government has proposed. The Islamic Action Front (IAF), the political arm of the Jordan branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, participated in Friday's demonstration after steering clear of the downtown marches for two weeks, participating in demonstrations in front of the Egyptian Embassy and organizing other activities instead. Nimer Al-Assaf, deputy secretary general of the IAF, said the group's decision to join to protesters this week was motivated in part by concern over the attack on demonstrators last week. ""We are here to say to the government we want you to take serious measures against the people who attacked the demonstrators last week."" Hamza Mansour, secretary general of the IAF echoed those concerns, saying, ""We're here today to condemn the 'baltaja' (acts of thugs) that we've seen in the streets of Amman."" He added that the group also joined Friday's demonstration to reassert the right of peaceful expression and their demands for reform. He said while the government has started with positive steps, like the progress made on amending the public meetings law, it's not enough. ""We need them to speed things up,"" Mansour said during Friday's march. ""We want fast, constitutional reforms that will lead us to a parliamentary government. We want reforms that will make the parliament a true representative of the Jordanian nation."" Mansour said the IAF and other opposition groups recently sent a letter to Bakhit asking for the new elections law and the political parties law to be addressed within two months. The government, meanwhile, has announced the formation of a national dialogue committee headed by the prime minister and eight ministers that will spend the next three-to-nine months engaging with groups across the political spectrum in order to come up with proposals for revising the two laws. Last Sunday, King Abdullah II told his new government to enact ""real and quick reform"" amid growing protests around the Middle East, promising to root out corruption and give lawmakers a bigger role in government. Khalid Kalaldeh, secretary general of the Left Social Movement remarked, ""Yes, we heard the king's speech but we have to see that on the ground, the government has to take some actions to apply this speech, until that time we are marching."" While there was an announcement at the march to return downtown on March 4 to demonstrate, the IAF and the Muslim Brotherhood say they now plan to meet with other opposition party leaders Monday night before announcing final plans for next Friday.","Anti-government protesters want faster political reform .

"(CNN) -- The family of an American citizen who was detained for several months in North Korea said Saturday it was ecstatic over news of his release and thanked the U.S. and North Korean governments for the roles they played in it. A U.S. team led by envoy Robert King left North Korea Saturday after winning the release Eddie Yong Su Jun, state media reported. ""Words cannot fully express how overjoyed we are to be reunited with our husband and father,"" read a statement from the Jun family that was given to CNN. ""We are grateful that the DPRK government has granted our plea for his humanitarian release; further, we sincerely thank them for taking care of his health."" Jun, a Korean-American businessman, was detained for ""committing a crime"" against North Korea after entering the country, KCNA had reported. Jun admitted his crime during an investigation, the North Korean news agency said, but it did not specify what crime he had allegedly committed. Jun was arrested in November, KCNA reported. ""We would also like to express our deep gratitude to the U.S. State Department and Congressman Royce and his staff for their unwavering commitment to protect the welfare of US citizens and to see our family reunited,"" Jun's family said, thanking Rep. Ed Royce, R-California. The family is from the southern part of the state. Jun's release followed a visit by King, the special envoy for North Korean human rights, and Jon Brause, from the U.S. Agency for International Development. The group went there to assess food shortages that have left thousands starving after floods and harsh weather devastated North Korea's crops. King and Brause ""expressed regret at the incident on behalf of the U.S. government and assured that it would make all its efforts to prevent the recurrence of similar incident,"" KCNA reported. The news agency also said former U.S. President Jimmy Carter asked North Korea to pardon Jun. ""Taking all this into account, the ... government decided to set him free from the humanitarian"" standpoint, KCNA said. State Department spokesman Mark Toner cheered news of Jun's release, but stressed decisions about food aid are in no way related to ""any policy decision if you will. It's a separate process all together,"" he said. The assessment team traveling with King will continue its work on the ground and ""when they come back, we will look at their assessments, study it and compare to other assessments by other ""nongovernmental organizations and groups that have made similar trips, to make a decision on the amount of aid to extend, Toner said Friday. While the United States praised the North for its action, the two countries are still a long way from normalizing relations. Tensions between North Korea and the West have spiked in recent years due in part to concerns over Pyongyang's nuclear development program. The United States and South Korea held joint military drills in February, despite North Korea's warning to the South not to carry them out -- calling the exercises a provocation. South Korea accuses the North of torpedoing and sinking one of its warships in March 2010, killing 46 sailors. In November, North Korea shelled Yeonpyeong Island, killing two South Korean marines and two civilians. That same month, it detained Jun. Two State Department officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release details, told CNN in April that Jun was a Korean-American businessman who had a visa to enter North Korea. The U.S. suspended aid two years ago to North Korea because it suspected the donated food was being diverted to the military or not reaching those most in need. North Korea has detained several Americans in recent years, increasing tension levels in what is already a rocky relationship between Pyongyang and Washington. In 2010, Carter helped secure the release of Aijalon Mahli Gomes, a U.S. citizen who was fined about $600,000 and sentenced to eight years of hard labor for crossing over the Chinese border into North Korea. Gomes, who attempted suicide while in North Korean custody, was thought to be a Christian activist. Two American journalists, Laura Ling and Euna Lee, were arrested after entering North Korea in 2009. They were sentenced to 12 years' hard labor before being released in August 2009 after an intervention by former President Bill Clinton.

"(CNN) -- Three people, including two former Auburn University football players, were killed late Saturday and three others were wounded in a shooting in an off-campus apartment complex in Auburn, Alabama, police said Sunday. A manhunt was under way in Montgomery, about 55 miles west of Auburn, for a suspect in the case, said Auburn Police Chief Tommy Dawson. He identified the suspect as Desmonte Leonard, 22, of Montgomery. Officers received a call reporting the shooting at the University Heights apartments clubhouse about 10:03 p.m. Saturday, Dawson said. Arriving officers found Edward Christian, 20, dead at the scene. Christian, of Valdosta, Georgia, was off the football team due to an injury, Dawson said. Former player Ladarious Phillips, 20, and Auburn resident Demario Pitts, 20, died later at a hospital, he said. Two others, including current Auburn sophomore offensive lineman Eric Mack, 20, of Cameron, South Carolina, were taken to East Alabama Medical Center in the nearby town of Opelika. Mack was released from the medical center about 11 a.m. Sunday after being treated for a gunshot wound, hospital spokesman John Atkinson said. Dawson said 20-year-old John Robertson was in critical condition and undergoing surgery Sunday at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital. Robertson was shot in the head, Dawson said. A third man, 19-year-old Xavier Moss, was treated and released from East Alabama Medical Center. Both Moss and Robertson are from Roanoke, Alabama, authorities said. Police have a motive in the shooting, but Dawson would not release it, saying ""that's for the courtroom, later on."" Authorities believe gunfire erupted during a fight at a party, he said. Leonard and two other men were thought to have fled the scene in a white Chevrolet Caprice. Police later found the car abandoned in an adjacent county, Dawson said, and it was being processed. CNN affiliate WGCL/CBS Atlanta reported that one witness, Turquorius Vines, said the violence was sudden. ""It went from us chilling with all these females, to a massacre,"" Vines told the station. ""It happened in a matter of seconds."" The men believed to have fled with Leonard were being sought for questioning Sunday, Dawson said, but did not release their identities, saying only that ""it would probably be in their best interest to come forward."" Arrest warrants have been issued for Leonard on three counts of capital murder, Dawson said. He is considered armed and dangerous, and U.S. Marshals were assisting in the search for him, along with Montgomery police. ""It's sickening that these young lives were cut short,"" Dawson said, ""and also the shooter is such a young man. As a society, we've got to learn the value of life again."" He urged anyone knowing Leonard's whereabouts to contact authorities, and urged Leonard to turn himself in to police. ""Hopefully, we'll make an arrest some time today,"" Dawson said. The chief would not say whether authorities believe more than one gun was involved. He said he was not aware of any connection between Leonard and the university. Auburn Mayor Bill Ham Jr. expressed sympathy to the victims' families. ""We are distraught that violence was used in such a senseless way and young lives were lost,"" he said. ""This is a tragic day for the entire Auburn community,"" Auburn Athletic Director Jay Jacobs said in a statement. ""First and foremost, our thoughts and prayers go out to the victims and their families who have been devastated by this senseless tragedy. ""We will support the families of the victims in the difficult days ahead in every way that we possibly can,"" he said. ""Our student-athletes are obviously stunned and deeply saddened, and we are providing counseling and support for them as they grieve the loss of their teammates and friends."" Gene Chizik, Auburn head football coach, called it ""a sad, sad day for everyone associated with the entire Auburn family."" Chizik said he is ""devastated"" at the three deaths, including those of Christian and Phillips, who he knew personally. ""We have a lot of people on our football team that are hurting right now and we're going to do everything we can to help them get through this,"" he said. ""We are relieved that Eric Mack, who was also a victim in this incident, is expected to make a full recovery. This is a very trying time for everyone involved, and I would just ask that you lift up the victims and their families in your prayers.""

"(CNN) -- After just over a century of amicable relations, Brazil has decided to cool its relationship with Iran. Gone are the days when Brazil's leader, President Luiz Inacio ""Lula"" da Silva (2002-2010), worked hard to strengthen Brazil's partnership with Iran, defending Iranian interests, sharing and learning from similar policy experiences over cafezinho. At a time when Brazil has sought every opportunity to engage the international community and increase its influence as a mediator of conflict and peace, why has Brazil's new president, Dilma Rousseff, refrained from strengthening the government's ties with Iran? The answer lies in Rousseff's personal experiences and geopolitical ambitions. As someone who experienced human rights violations first hand under Brazil's military dictatorships (1964-1985), Rousseff has been unwaveringly committed to human rights. She has made it crystal clear that she will not support Iran unless President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad seriously addresses this issue. It's striking how quickly two nations sharing similar economic and geopolitical interests have suddenly distanced themselves from each other and how Brazil's decision may negatively affect Iran's relationship with other countries. What this also suggests is that amicable relationships between similar nations are never guaranteed and that a sudden change in government interests and aspirations can reverse historic partnerships while having broader geopolitical ramifications. For Rousseff, personal experiences matter. As a high school student from the city of Belo Horizonte, she joined a Marxist revolutionary group called Palmares Revolutionary Armed Vanguard (Var-Palmares), which sought to dethrone a military government that repeatedly violated civil and human rights. In 1970, she was arrested, interrogated and placed in prison. While serving three years, Rousseff was periodically tortured: electrical shocks ran throughout her body; she was incessantly beaten and called names; she was hung upside down in between two steel platforms in what the military called the pau de arara, ""parrots perch."" By the time of her release at 25, she lost more than 22 pounds and her thyroid glands were nearly destroyed. Needless to say, these horrific experiences had an enduring imprint on Rousseff's foreign policy views. Indeed, when questioned about Iran during her campaign trail in 2009, the first two words to often come out of her mouth were ""human"" and ""rights."" The Iranian regime's atrocious history of killing thousands of dissidents, when combined with Iranian court orders to have several people stoned to death for violating the law was viewed by Rousseff as ""medieval behavior."" Moreover, the regime's decision to continuously throw political opponents in jail touched a sensitive nerve with Rousseff. She made it very clear that before any business took place with Iran, Ahmadinejad would need to stop these barbaric acts. Yet this may prove difficult as Ahmadinejad's political influence is often perceived as limited because of the presence of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Being blamed and essentially ignored by Ahmadinejad also didn't help. Last year, Ahmadinejad's media adviser, Ali Akbar Javanfekr, was quoted as stating that Rousseff had ""destroyed years of good relations"" between them. Under Lula, Brazil strengthened its political and economic ties with Iran through trade (indirectly via Dubai, estimated at $1.25 billion in 2010) and investment in Iran's oil sector. But when Ahmadinejad visited Latin America this January, he avoided meeting with Rousseff. Apparently he regrets having done so and plans to meet with her later this year. Rousseff's geopolitical aspirations have also caused her to step away from Tehran. After Lula joined Turkey in 2010 to vote against U.N. sanctions on Iran for failing to disclose information about its nuclear reactor site and ignoring Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's request to do so, it appears that Rousseff views distancing herself from Iran as a way to strengthen Brazil's relationship with the United States. Through these efforts, it seems that Rousseff is seeking to garner U.S. support for a permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council, as well as increasing Brazil's influence in major international financial institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund. Without Rousseff's support, Ahmadinejad faces problems in Latin America. Iran has tried to strengthen ties with Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, Cuba, and until recently, Brazil. And it's opened six embassies in the region since 2005, sans Brazil. But Ahmadinejad can essentially forget about getting the support of Brazil's close economic allies, such as Mexico, Argentina and Chile. Ahmadinejad has also failed to live up to his promise of helping spur economic development in the region. At a time when he is trying to increase his legitimacy, given his hostile relationship with Israel and efforts to develop his nuclear reactors, Ahmadinejad might not be able to afford losing his Latin friends, as they have defended him in the past and their support makes him look less isolated in the world. This freeze in relations with Brazil, and Iran's gradual loss of allies in the region, also opens up further opportunity for the United Nations to impose and enforce additional sanctions on Iran. Should this occur, Ahmadinejad faces the specter of other allies questioning their relationship with Iran, which could have serious political and economic repercussions for Iran. Despite the rich history that these two nations share, it seems unlikely that Rousseff will want to strengthen her ties with Ahmadinejad. With aspirations to increase Brazil's international influence and geopolitical importance, she will likely place more stock in strengthening her relationship with the United States and other cooperative nations within the United Nations. Unless Ahmadinejad changes his tune on human rights and decides to fully abide by U.N. rules, Iran's losses may go beyond Brazil. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ed Gómez.","For a century, Brazil has had amicable relations with Iran, says Eduardo Gómez .

"(CNN) -- If language has anything to do with winning an election -- and it does (see below) -- we don't need recent news that Obama is ahead in key swing states to teach us who's going to be president for the next four years. The way Obama speaks and the way his campaign uses language will go a long way in warming the hearts of those who vote more on the basis of the gut than on policy details or preset commitments. Romney's recent surmises on how cultural differences have determined the differing fates of Israel and the Palestinians have an analogue here. Romney and Obama come from different linguistic cultures, and unfortunately for Romney, his is increasingly obsolete. Romney not only looks but talks ""like a president."" Few consider Obama's speaking style un-presidential either, but Romney's speaking style, that of the airline pilot or the man in the GPS saying ""Turn right,"" is even more of what we think of as how the commander in chief talks. However, that vision -- informed by memories of FDR, JFK, and Martin Sheen's President Bartlett on ""The West Wing"" -- is now out of step with what really stirs people in their guts about public figures. The cool, WASP-y voice now has an archaic ring to it, redolent of what Boomers long ago dismissed as the Establishment. Our era prefers a folksier voice, in real life, in movies, in music and even in our candidates for high office. This is partly due to the egalitarian preferences that the 1960s counterculture left in its wake, and partly that nonstop television and web coverage simulates intimacy. Even Hillary Clinton tried to fake a Joe Sixpack cadence speaking to working-class white audiences in 2008, in a way that neither FDR nor JFK would have dreamed of trying to pull off. Obama, however, comes to folksy cadence naturally. It's part of his speech repertoire as a black American. Some think him ""fake"" when sounding preacherly in speeches to the NAACP, but they miss that Obama is doing just what most black Americans do 24/7, sliding between two ways of talking: vanilla and chocolate. Romney's stuck with the vanilla, while Obama even mixes in a bit of chocolate in mainstream speeches. As such, he has a warmer speech presence. His very intonation of ""Yes, we can!"" was indicative: it would have sounded hollow in the mouths of Hillary Clinton or John Edwards and downright pathetic from John McCain. His repeated incantations of ""Pass this bill"" in his address to Congress last September made his address sound almost like a church sermon. The approachability of his cadence makes even the swipes he takes at Republicans sound less barbed than they would from Romney. We hear often that the taller candidate always wins. It's also true that for decades, the warmer speaker has. George W. Bush's Texan inflections made both Al Gore and John Kerry sound like schoolteachers. Bill Clinton's light, scratchy drawl created an instant approachability that made Bush the father sound like a patrician and Bob Dole like the Viagra pitchman he eventually became. Yet, even Bush the father sounded approachable and ""nice"" -- recall Dana Carvey's send-up -- compared with Michael Dukakis' beige speaking style. Ronald Reagan, smiling with a dusting of wry, sounded like your grandfather. Jimmy Carter, despite the Georgia accent, always sounded a bit sad and sanctimonious, while Walter Mondale sounded like your accountant. The language gulf between Obama and Romney is even on view on their websites. Romney's, as I write, is bedecked with moral responsibility and learn the truth, negatives like Obama Isn't Working, and the petulant You did build that. Meanwhile, Obama's site gives us snapshot, faces, listen up, loving, and chocolate (all of which also could be taken as evoking the Obamas as a family!). To voters on the fence, what will appeal more: truth and responsibility or snapshots and chocolate? The answer is clear. In an ideal world for Romney, his media coaching would include Henry Higgins-style speech lessons from Chris Rock or Louis C.K. Short of that, a presidential candidate who sounds like your father's history teacher is dragging along quite the linguistic ball and chain. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John McWhorter.","Mitt Romney's linguistic culture is increasingly becoming obsolete, says John McWhorter .

"(CNN) -- Iconic American artist LeRoy Neiman, known for his trademark handlebar mustache and his bright, impressionistic portrayals of the world's top sporting events, died in New York on Wednesday. He was 91. The cause of death was not immediately known. ""We mourn the passing of such an extraordinary and talented man,"" said a statement from his wife Janet and his family, who were with the artist when he died Wednesday evening at New York-Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. Although his paintings captured everything from U.S. presidents to jazz musicians to the powerful animals of Africa, Neiman became best known for his bright, bold sketches of the sports world, capturing its motion and emotion in his brushstrokes. The most influential artist you've probably never heard of . Neiman ""has the journalistic talent, as well as the artistic ability, to convey the essence of a game or contestant with great impact, from the Kentucky Derby to Wilt Chamberlain, from the America's Cup to Muhammad Ali, from the Super Bowl to Bobby Hull,"" sports writer Nick Seitz said. He was named official artist of the Olympic Winter Games in Lake Placid and in Sarajevo as well as the Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Neiman's powerful imagery of the boxing ring, including fight posters and program covers for the historic Muhammad Ali-Joe Frazier fights, earned him a spot in the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2007. He was so closely identified with the world of boxing that actor/director Sylvester Stallone tapped Neiman to appear in four of his ""Rocky"" movies. Neiman was born June 8, 1921, in St. Paul, Minnesota, the son of Lydia Sophia Serline and Charles Julius Runquist. He later took the surname of one of his stepfathers, after his biological father abandoned the family, his biography says. He enlisted in the army in 1942, serving during World War II. Neiman was in the invasion of Normandy and fought in the Battle of the Bulge, according to his publicist Gail Parenteau, later attending Chicago's prestigious School of the Art Institute on the G.I. Bill. Neiman taught at the Institute for 10 years early in his career before gaining recognition as a contributing artist for Playboy in the 1950s. The series ""Man at His Leisure"" appeared in the magazine for 15 years, showing the artist's impressions of sporting events and social activities. Included in the series was the Grand Prix in Monaco, the Beatles in London and the running of the bulls in Pamplona, Spain. Staying true to his style, Neiman's public persona was as almost as colorful as his artwork. ""I guess I created LeRoy Neiman,"" the artist once said, according to the biography on his website. ""Nobody else told me how to do it. Well, I'm a believer in the theory that the artist is as important as his work.""

"(CNN) -- A week ago, on feel-good Super Bowl Sunday, TV viewers in the U.S. state of Michigan were subjected to a racist campaign ad sponsored by former Representative and now-Senatorial candidate Pete Hoekstra. The ad, which suggests that his opponent, U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow, spends too much government money, shows an Asian woman riding a bicycle in a landscape of rice paddies. ""Your economy get very weak. Ours get very good. We take your jobs,"" says the native Californian actress in a mock Chinese accent while addressing ""Debbie Spend-It-Now."" Hoekstra also appears, saying at the end, ""I approve this message."" Public condemnation ensued, with demands for an apology and the ad's removal. It's not the first time that China, or any connections to China, have been used to stoke fear this U.S. election season. In early January, a group in support of Republican presidential hopeful Ron Paul released a campaign ad slamming then-candidate Jon Huntsman, the former ambassador to China. The ""China Jon"" ad showed Huntsman speaking Chinese and wearing a red tikka on his forehead (a sacred mark associated with Hinduism) and questioned his adoption of girls from China and India. ""Jon Huntsman: American Values?"" the ad asks, calling him ""The Manchurian candidate,"" ""Weak on China?"" with ostensibly Chinese music in the background. Paul denounced the ad, telling CNN he had no control over his supporters' actions. Then on Thursday, a U.S. Marine sergeant was found not guilty of hazing Lance Cpl. Harry Lew, who committed suicide last April in Afghanistan. A Marine Corps report revealed that Lew had been beaten by his superiors with sand poured in his mouth for falling asleep while on duty. Another Marine was sentenced to 30 days in jail and demoted; a third faces court-martial over the death. Lew's case along with that of Pvt. Danny Chen, who was found dead in October from an apparent suicide, have spurred Asian American members of Congress to demand hearings on hazing in the military. Chen, the only Chinese American soldier in his unit in Afghanistan, was called ""gook,"" ""chink"" and ""dragon lady,"" forced to crawl on gravel while fellow troops threw rocks at him, and made to shout instructions in Chinese to fellow troops (no one else in his unit spoke Chinese). The Asian American civil rights group OCA has met with Pentagon officials to demand better treatment of Asians in the military. Against all of this, Jeremy Lin, a Harvard grad and the NBA's first U.S.-born player of Chinese or Taiwanese descent, has vaulted himself to stardom. On Saturday, Lin led the Knicks to their fifth straight victory. His 109 points in his first four starts this past week have surpassed Allen Iverson's to become the most by any player since the NBA-ABA merger in 1976. Read about Linsanity vs. Tebowmania . For those who've been following the campaign ad controversies as well as the Lew and Chen cases, Lin's meteoric rise has been a much-needed sign of hope. But the conversations on Facebook, in bars and living rooms are as diverse as the Asian American community itself. Some are pumped up about seeing an Asian face next to Kobe Bryant's or moved by Lin's public devotion to Christianity. Others are analyzing Lin's academic and athletic prowess and thinking about the role model he'll be for their children. Jeremy Lin: The NBA's breath of fresh air . Lin himself has been candid about the racism he's encountered along the way. ""It's a sport for white and black people,"" he told the San Francisco Chronicle in 2008. ""You don't get respect for being an Asian-American basketball player in the U.S. ... I hear everything. 'Go back to China. Orchestra is on the other side of campus. Open up your eyes.'"" Read how Lin has a shot at basketball immortality . Unfortunately, success doesn't stamp out racism. Minutes after Lin's breathtaking career-high 38-point performance against the LA Lakers Friday night, FoxSports.com national columnist Jason Whitlock tweeted ""Some lucky lady in NYC is gonna feel a couple inches of pain tonight."" After condemnation by the Asian American Journalists Association, he tweeted an apology, acknowledging that he had ""debased a feel-good sports moment. For that, I'm truly sorry."" Almost exactly a decade ago, some of us remember similar knocks against a certain 7'6"" new kid on the block. USA Today ran a column by Jon Saraceno in 2002 saying, ""the [Rockets] franchise could wind up with egg foo yong all over its face"" and ""What happens the first time a bona fide NBA strongman, say Shaquille O'Neal, whacks [Yao Ming] in the chopsticks?"" Just this past week, a Manchester United fan, Howard Hobson, was banned from matches for three years and fined 200 pounds (US $315) for cursing and making monkey sounds at Stoke City's Kenwyne Jones, who is from Trinidad. To be fair, Lin and other minority athletes today have not been subjected to the level of racism that African American sports pioneers faced before them. Jesse Owens was a great American athlete who prevailed despite being born into an officially and unofficially racist society. The African American track star, who had to live in off-campus segregated housing at Ohio State University, went on to win four gold medals at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Germany, much to the dismay of Adolf Hitler. Three-quarters of a century later, there are those who want to leave race out of the equation altogether and embrace minority athletes, actors and other pioneers for their skills alone rather than their skin color. ""Many people want the debate to end,"" says Laurens Grant, the director and producer of ""Jesse Owens,"" a forthcoming PBS documentary. ""But the debate isn't settled. It won't end until there's more opportunity."" Many of us have been lucky enough to escape the burn of bullying and racism. We might have walked through our schoolyards without hearing taunts from fellow students. We might have gotten the promotions we deserved at work. Our perfect American English may have averted giggles and impatience. We may have served in the armed forces without being treated any differently from fellow troops. And we might have been lucky enough to escape the perpetrators of hate crimes, like the laid-off Detroit autoworkers who in 1982 beat Vincent Chin, a Chinese American, to death with a baseball bat after his bachelor party because they were bitter about competition from Japanese carmakers. Such xenophobic sentiment gets eerily stirred up by ads like the ones attacking Sen. Stabenow and Jon Huntsman. Hopefully one day, Americans of Asian descent will no longer be seen as foreigners, economic competition or anything less than equal Americans. Until then, race matters, whether we like it or not.

"Cape Town, South Africa (CNN) -- For Cape Town's carnivores, Mzoli's Meat is the city's hippest hangout. The informal butchery and barbeque joint is a place where social and racial barriers are set aside as locals and out-of-towners come together to eat, drink and party. Even celebrity chef Jamie Oliver is a fan, recently describing Mzoli's as ""sexy"" and praising the ""incredible flavor"" of its grilled meat. Also known as Kwa-Mzoli, Mzoli's Place or Mzoli's Butchery, Mzoli's is a meeting place that brings together people from all walks of life. It was opened in 2003 in Gugulethu, a township 15 km from the center of Cape Town, South Africa, when owner Mzoli Ngcawuzele saw a gap in the market. ""We looked at what was missing in the market, especially in our community and we began to say, 'what can really bring people from all walks of life together?'

"(CNN) -- All 25,000 people living in a refugee camp in Sudan's Darfur region have fled amid fighting between armed militia groups and Sudanese government forces, U.N. officials said Friday. Many of the refugees have sought shelter in nearby Kutum town or the Zariba area, the African Union-United Nations Mission in Darfur (UNAMID) said, but lack water, food and sanitation. The U.N. humanitarian agency OCHA said reports indicated that the entire population of the Kassab camp had ""fled because of the fighting."" The camp in North Darfur housed those who had already been displaced from their homes during nine years of conflict in the region. Chris Cycmanick, head of media relations for UNAMID, told CNN that many people had fled Kutum as well as the Kassab camp. ""It is a complex situation with multiple armed groups,"" he said, describing the fighters as tribal militia. ""What the people have asked for mostly is security and medical care, so we are trying to provide that,"" he said. ""They say they want to return to Kassab camp, but very few of them have returned."" Cycmanick said Darfur was still troubled, although the media has largely turned its attention to South Sudan and the Arab Spring . ""The situation is troublesome, it is not supposed to be happening in Darfur, but there is still fighting going on,"" he said. ""Between 2010 and 2011, we saw a decrease in civilian casualties here. But recently, there has been an uptick in criminal activity."" Those newly forced from their homes say they fear to return unless security is improved. ""We are afraid to return to the camp, because armed men may come back to attack us,"" Fatima Adam Badaui, a woman from the Kassab camp, told UNAMID. Asked if the organization was doing enough to safeguard civilians, Cycmanick said: ""I think there is always more that can be done. We are in a difficult situation. We are looking at a sovereign country. It is ultimately their responsibility to protect the civilian population."" President al-Bashir feels heat from 'Sudanese Spring' In its weekly bulletin, the OCHA said it had ""received reports of looting of houses of displaced people, markets and businesses"" in the camp and Kutum town. Members of the Sudanese Armed Forces removed the ""armed tribesmen"" from Kutum town last Saturday, but the militiamen returned a day later to fight again, the OCHA said. ""It has not been possible to determine the number of civilians killed and injured,"" the agency said. ""During the violence, the premises of five humanitarian organisations were looted. Humanitarian staff have been evacuated to El Fasher town."" A UNAMID statement Monday said the violence began after an incident on August 1, when three armed men carjacked the local district commissioner and his driver and shot them dead. ""Subsequently, on the same day armed men surrounded Kassab, looted the market, burnt down the Sudanese Police post in the camp and reportedly killed four persons (three civilians and one police officer) and injured six others,"" the statement said. Security continued to deteriorate over the following days in Kutum town, Kassab camp and another camp, Fataborno, ""including fighting between the armed elements and government forces, as well as looting and displacement of civilians,"" it said. UNAMID said it had bolstered its presence in the camps and urged the government to protect civilians there. Four days later, all those living in the Kassab camp have fled. Conditions for the refugees now in Kutum are poor, with the majority of those displaced from the camp living in open areas without basic services, such as clean water, food, sanitation facilities and health care, UNAMID said Friday. ""The situation there is very bad, houses and shelters are crowded, the health situation is getting worse and they lack sufficient food,"" said Altheir Ismail Ali, a community leader in the camp quoted by UNAMID. UNAMID said it had worked with local health officials and the World Health Organization to give medical aid to 170 people Thursday. They were treated for ailments including respiratory infections, trauma and malaria, as well as injuries that occurred during the attacks on the camp, UNAMID said. Children were also treated for fever and diarrhea. U.N. workers have also been giving out drinking water. The United Nations estimates as many as 300,000 people have been killed and almost 3 million people have been displaced from their homes since the Darfur conflict broke out in 2003. A paper published by the independent monitoring group Small Arms Survey last month, titled ""Forgotten Darfur: Old Tactics and New Players,"" details how the violence in the troubled region continues. New non-Arab ""Popular Defense Forces"" have been recruited, trained and armed by the Sudanese government since late 2010 to force Zaghawa rebel groups out of a swath of the eastern Darfur region, the paper says. As a result, about 70,000 people had been displaced by mid-2011, and retaliatory attacks by both sides continue, it says. Meanwhile, aerial bombardment has continued to target rebel forces and civilian villages believed to support them, in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions, the paper says. Weapons and ammunition also continue to flow into the hands of proxy forces and government forces in defiance of a ""wholly ineffective"" embargo on Darfur, it says. In March of this year, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Sudan's defense minister for 41 counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes allegedly committed in the Darfur region. Abdelrahim Mohamed Hussein is wanted for actions from August 2003 to March 2004 in Darfur, where rebels have fought government forces and allied militiamen such as the Janjaweed since 2003. Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir is also wanted for crimes against humanity by the ICC in connection with the Darfur conflict. Four ways social media could transform the conflict in Africa .

"Washington (CNN) -- On March 25, 1863, in the heat of the U.S. Civil War, Pvt. Jacob Parrott and six other Union soldiers received the Medal of Honor for going 200 miles behind enemy lines to hijack a Confederate train. He became the first U.S. service member to receive the medal. Parrott survived the Civil War and, according to several websites, went on to become a cabinetmaker. Fast-forward to September 17, 2009, when Sgt. First Class Jared Monti was awarded the Medal of Honor for heroics in Afghanistan. President Obama handed the medal to Monti's parents, because Monti died earning his medal. Of the 3,466 Medals of Honor awarded since Parrott received his, only 619 have been awarded posthumously, according to the U.S. Army. But in the past four decades, posthumous Medal of Honor ceremonies have become the rule rather than the exception. For all the military actions since the end of the Vietnam War, only eight Medals of Honor have been awarded: two for the ""Black Hawk Down"" incident in Somalia, four for Operation Iraqi Freedom and two for the war in Afghanistan, the longest war in U.S. history. None was given for Operation Desert Storm in Iraq, the fighting in the Balkans, Panama, Grenada or the Marine barracks bombing in Lebanon. All eight of those medals were awarded posthumously. It's something the Pentagon wanted to change, and Friday, the White House said Obama called Staff Sgt. Sal Giunta to tell him he will soon receive the familiar gold star medal on a light blue ribbon. Giunta is being recognized for risking his life to save a fellow soldier who had been captured by the Taliban. Giunta survived battle and is alive and well to attend the White House ceremony to receive the medal. Last year, Defense Secretary Robert Gates was asked about the lack of a living Medal of Honor recipient. ""This has been a source of real concern to me,"" Gates said at the time. On Friday, Geoff Morrell, the secretary's spokesman, said Gates was ""delighted that someone who survived his act of heroism will be honored."" Gates probably will call Giunta next week to congratulate him. Perhaps the reason there are so few living Medal of Honor recipients is that there have been so few recipients at all. Compare the eight Medals of Honor that have been awarded for heroism in the last 40 years with World War II, when the battle of Iwo Jima produced 27 such medals and 15 men were honored for heroism during the attack on Pearl Harbor. Last year, Marine Corps Commandant James Conway explained one reason why the medal has become more rare. ""The rules haven't changed; the rules and the requirements are still the same,"" he said. ""I think it has something to do with the level of intensity of the conflict,"" Conway said. ""If you go back and look at some of the fights that took place in Vietnam, Korea, World War II, there were massive numbers of troops involved in massive engagements over a period of days. That's not the type of conflict that we are seeing in a type of counterinsurgency in Iraq and Afghanistan."" ""So I think that's perhaps the single most determining factor here as you look at awarding or not awarding a medal,"" Conway said. It is also important to note that when the Medal of Honor was authorized by Congress (which is why it's often called the Congressional Medal of Honor, because the president presents it on behalf of Congress), it was only one of two medals a soldier could earn. The other was the Purple Heart, which goes to soldiers wounded or killed in combat. Since then, the Silver Star, the Distinguished Services Crosses, the Bronze Star and numerous other awards have been created. So a service member's heroism may well be recognized with a medal, just not the Medal of Honor. In some ways, no one wants to see any more Medals of Honor awarded. ""You don't want your soldiers to be put in that situation to where any of them have to rise to the occasion,"" Brian Thacker, an Army veteran who earned the Medal of Honor in Vietnam, told CNN last year. Conway echoed that sentiment. ""Any time a soldier or a Marine wins the medal, then his unit is in extremis, and he's doing very heroic things ... to make that situation better. I don't want to wish that on anybody."" But if there are heroes, all agree they should be recognized, and now one hero will be there to hear the applause and shake the president's hand. One day before the White House announced the award for Giunta, the administration said it will also award the Medal of Honor to Staff Sgt. Robert J. Miller, who saved the lives of his fellow soldiers and 15 Afghan National Army troops. Miller's award will be given to his parents. Miller died saving those lives.","U.S. Army says of 3,467 Medals of Honor awarded, only 619 were awarded posthumously .
Recently, more of the medals granted posthumously; Pentagon wanted that changed .
Soon, staff sergeant who survived his act of heroism will receive the medal .
Narrower recent conflicts, addition of other medals may have cut Medal of Honor awards ."
"Washington (CNN) -- Police arrested actor George Clooney and others Friday during a protest at the Sudanese Embassy in Washington. The arrested protesters included congressmen, human rights activists and faith leaders. ""We are here really to ask two very simple questions,"" Clooney said moments before his arrest. ""The first question is something immediate -- and immediately, we need humanitarian aid to be allowed into the Sudan before it becomes the worst humanitarian crisis in the world."" The second thing, he said, ""is for the government in Khartoum to stop randomly killing its own innocent men, women and children. Stop raping them and stop starving them. That's all we ask."" Protesters had begun gathering in the street before the protest began and converged on the Embassy once Clooney and the others arrived, holding signs reading ""Stop Bombing Civilians Now!"" and ""End the silence stop the violence."" Those arrested included United to End Genocide President Tom Andrews; Democratic Reps. Jim McGovern, Al Green, Jim Moran and John Olver; Martin Luther King III; and NAACP President Ben Jealous. CNN iReporter films Clooney arrest . Jealous directed a message to the Sudanese president: ""This is what beginning of the end looks like."" ""We are protesting to make sure the Sudanese government knows that the world is watching,"" McGovern said. ""The United States Congress is watching. And we will be back again and again until they stop using food as a weapon; stop slaughtering innocent men, women and children; and stop spitting in the face of the world community."" After speeches by several of the protest leaders, a police officer told the group she was giving them a third warning, after which they would be arrested. A few moments later, the arrests began. The group stood calmly as they waited for the police to apply plastic handcuffs as the crowd of protesters chanted ""al-Bashir to the ICC,"" referring to the International Criminal Court, where Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir has been indicted. Clooney was charged with disorderly crossing of a police line, a misdemeanor, Secret Service spokesman Max Millien said. The Secret Service is responsible for security at foreign diplomatic missions in Washington. He paid a $100 fine, choosing to forfeit that money to avoid a court appearance, said Gwendolyn Crump, a spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Police Department. Clooney met with President Obama on Thursday to discuss his concerns about Sudan. He testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee this week about violence in the Nuba Mountains in South Kordofan, a state in Sudan near its border with newly independent South Sudan. Clooney and other activists blame the Sudanese government for attacks there that have injured and killed civilians. Clooney told the Senate committee that the attacks are being orchestrated by Sudan's government, led by al-Bashir, government official Ahmad Harun and Defense Minister Abdelrahim Mohamed Hussein -- the same three men, he said, who orchestrated long-documented attacks in Darfur. ""What you see is a constant drip of fear,"" testified Clooney, who just returned from a trip to Sudan. ""We found children filled with shrapnel, including a 9-year-old boy who had both of his hands blown off."" This month the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Hussein, listing 41 counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes allegedly committed in the Darfur region of Sudan. Al-Bashir and Harun are also facing war crimes charges involving Darfur. Clooney is co-founder of the Satellite Sentinel Project, which uses satellite imagery to watch for aerial attacks and troop movements in Sudan and South Sudan, which became a separate country last year.

"Bellefonte, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- A jury convicted former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky on 45 of 48 counts related to sexual abuse of boys over a 15-year period, ending a painful chapter for victims and the Penn State community. Jurors delivered the verdict around 10 p.m. Friday after deliberating for 21 hours. There were convictions related to all 10 sexual abuse victims, with the three not-guilty verdicts applying to three different individuals. Sandusky stood slightly hunched, looking down with his hand in his pocket but showing no visible emotion as the guilty verdicts were read out in court. His wife, Dottie, blinked back tears. Reaction to the Sandusky verdict . Judge John Cleland revoked Sandusky's bail and ordered his arrest. Sandusky left the courthouse in handcuffs, headed for a police car destined for the Centre County jail. When asked if he had anything to say to the victims, the 68-year-old remained silent as he ducked into the back seat of the car. ""The Sandusky family is very disappointed by the verdict of the jury, but we respect their verdict,"" defense lawyer Joe Amendola told reporters gathered outside. Jeering crowds occasionally interrupted his comments. At the same time, Amendola pointed to a ""tidal wave of public opinion"" against his client as one of several factors that led him to believe this outcome wasn't surprising. ""It was the expected outcome because of the overwhelming evidence against Jerry Sandusky,"" he said. Pennsylvania Attorney General Linda Kelly, expressed satisfaction in the jury's decision to hold the ex-coach accountable. She was especially thankful for the victims who testified, in some cases many years after they were abused. ""It was incredibly difficult for some of them to unearth long buried memories of (what) they had suffered,"" Kelly said. ""This trial was not something that they sought, but rather something that forced them to face the demons of their past."" Victim No. 6: Violation and vindication . Back inside the courtroom, the young man identified in court documents as Victim 6 was in tears as he hugged prosecutors. Sandusky should be sentenced in about 90 days, the judge said. Amendola indicated ""we have some appeals we will pursue,"" though he did not elaborate. The case has gripped the nation since last fall, when it led to the dismissal of legendary coach Joe Paterno and one of America's highest-paid university president, Graham Spanier. The family of Paterno, who died in January, issued a statement Friday after the verdict. ""Although we understand the task of healing is just beginning, today's verdict is an important milestone,"" the statement said. ""The community owes a measure of gratitude to the jurors for their diligent service. Our thoughts and prayers continue to be with the victims and their families."" The university, meanwhile, said it had ""tremendous respect for the men who came forward to tell their stories publicly."" ""No verdict can undo the pain and suffering caused by Mr. Sandusky, but we do hope this judgment helps the victims and their families along their path to healing,"" Penn State said in a statement. Penn State said it will invite the victims to participate in a program to facilitate resolution. ""The university wants to provide a forum where the university can privately, expeditiously and fairly address the victims' concerns and compensate them for claims relating to the University."" During closing arguments, prosecutors described the ex-Nittany Lions defensive coordinator as a pedophile who preyed on victims using a charity he founded for troubled children, repeatedly abusing young boys in his care. His defense sought to poke holes in the prosecution's case throughout the trial, such as pointing to inconsistencies in the testimony of Mike McQueary, a former graduate assistant who testified that he witnessed Sandusky apparently sodomizing a boy in a university shower. Amendola reminded jurors of the lack of physical evidence in the case, accusing the alleged victims of conspiring for financial gain, while also blaming the media for what he described as biased coverage. iReport: Share your reaction . Lead prosecutor Joseph McGettigan rebuffed those arguments, telling jurors that ""the commonwealth has overwhelming evidence against Mr. Sandusky."" In a bombshell announcement Thursday evening, Matt Sandusky -- one of Jerry Sandusky's six adopted children -- said through his attorney that he was sexually abused by the former coach, adding that he had been prepared to testify against him. Legal analysts say the accusation could bring additional charges, including incest charges, against the former coach. The broader scandal has also brought charges against vice president Gary Schultz and former Athletic Director Tim Curley for perjury and failing to report the abuse. After a week of testimony, during which time witnesses graphically described sexual encounters with Sandusky that they said occurred during their boyhoods, jurors made their decision without ever having heard from Sandusky on the witness stand. What Sandusky has said about child rape allegations . On Tuesday, Sandusky's wife told jurors that she could remember at least six of her husband's accusers staying overnight at their house, but that she never witnessed sexual abuse. All you need to know about allegations, how case unraveled . Eight young men testified, often in disturbingly graphic detail, of how Sandusky forced them to engage in sexual acts in various places, including showers in the Penn State coaches' locker room, hotel rooms and the basement of his home. One told jurors that Sandusky -- whom he met, like many of the accusers, through The Second Mile foundation that the ex-coach founded -- had threatened him if he told others about the abuse. Another said Sandusky warned him that he might send him home from a trip to Texas, where they'd gone to watch a Penn State bowl game. The defense challenged the accusers' timetable, questioned the various allegations and called multiple character witness to defend Sandusky's stellar reputation in the community. 'The Sandusky 8' describe seduction, molestation and betrayal . Though Friday night's verdict prompted cheers outside the courtroom, inside, the mother of Victim 6 did not claim victory. ""Nobody wins. We've all lost,"" she said before hugging her son.

"(CNN) -- It's 35 years after the release of Fleetwood Mac's groundbreaking album ""Rumours,"" and Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham are holding hands. Maybe it's true that absence makes the heart grow fonder. Or maybe it's a put-on, knowing that fans are still intrigued by the complicated interpersonal drama that drives the band. ""Rumours"" gave listeners a voyeuristic peek into the messy romantic lives of the quintet. ""Go Your Own Way"" was Buckingham's anguished kiss-off to Nicks. ""Don't Stop"" was Christine McVie's song of encouragement to her soon-to-be ex-husband, John McVie. A special anniversary reissue of ""Rumours"" is now available, with expanded and deluxe versions featuring previously unreleased demos and early takes, along with a dozen live recordings from the group's 1977 world tour. At 35, still the 'perfect album' In April, Nicks and Buckingham will join drummer Mick Fleetwood and bassist John McVie for their first tour in three years. In addition to their arsenal of beloved hits, they're hoping to crowd-test three newly recorded tracks. ""We have two brand new songs and one really, really old song,"" Nicks said. The ""old"" tune predates Fleetwood Mac: an unreleased nugget written for the ""Buckingham Nicks"" LP, which marks its 40th anniversary this year. The two ""new"" tracks were penned by Buckingham. Last year, he went into the studio with Fleetwood and McVie to record eight songs they hoped would become the catalyst for a new Fleetwood Mac album. But Nicks had reservations. ""We really didn't want to rent a house for a year and then make a whole record with 13, 14, 15 songs on it, then have most of the people who are thinking about buying it buy one song,"" she explained. ""So we did the three songs, and we'll see how the world reacts to that. If they love those three songs, then maybe they might talk us into doing something else."" Maybe Nicks and Buckingham's hand-holding isn't for the cameras. Maybe it's to remind each other that despite their differences, they remain personally supportive and unified in their commitment to the juggernaut that is Fleetwood Mac -- even if it means playing mostly vintage hits for their upcoming tour. ""That's okay,"" Buckingham conceded. ""That's part and parcel with what we do."" ""We laugh,"" added Nicks, ""but (the classics are) why we all have a beautiful house.""","It's the 35th anniversary of Fleetwood Mac's groundbreaking ""Rumours""

"(CNN) -- A Dubai-based perfume, cosmetics and jewelry chain is set to become one of the first international luxury retailers to open its doors in previously war-torn areas of Iraq. Paris Gallery, known across the Gulf for its opulent premises piled high with glass cabinets of designer watches, perfumes, and other mainly European luxury goods, has unveiled plans to open at least five stores across major cities in Iraq -- including Baghdad and Basra -- over the next three years. With the first shop due to begin trading in the first half of 2013, Paris Gallery CEO Mohamed A. R. Al Fahim says that now is the time to invest in Iraq's domestic market. ""We've been waiting for years for the right conditions,"" he said. ""We've done extensive assessments and believe that now the country is really moving away from what it was to what it wants to be ... there is great potential."" The IMF estimates that between 2009 and 2012, GDP per-capita based on current prices in Iraq more than doubled, and Paris Gallery is hedging its bets on the growth of a previously stagnant consumer culture and Iraqis with more disposable income. ""When companies like ours move into places like Iraq, it tells the people something which is: 'Look guys, you deserve it -- you deserve to feel better about yourself, you deserve to have some of the best products from around the world at your doorstep,'"" Fahim said. ""It's a confidence boost for the people."" Sura Alrawi is an accountant earning $19,000 a year -- over four times the national average based on IMF figures. She has lived and worked in Baghdad her whole life and welcomes the prospect of being able to purchase branded cosmetics and perfumes locally. The price of bottle of perfume starts at $50 dollars and many cosmetics brands familiar in the West will be easily available for the first time. ""I'm an Iraqi woman who can afford and wants to buy the kind of things that very few shops here sell,"" she said. Now 23, Alrawi was just a young girl before the 2003 U.S.-led war in Iraq that toppled Saddam Hussein, but she still recalls that the most basic international brands were then prohibitively difficult to buy. ""Our borders with Iran and Kuwait were blocked and there was an international economic blockade, so I remember it was very expensive to buy anything fancy,"" she said. Even now, Alrawi -- who lives at home with her parents -- says that imports are inconvenient and import duties costly. As such, she and her friends are looking forward to the sheer convenience of stores like the Paris Gallery opening in their city. ""Yes there is still a lot of variation in incomes here, and of course I don't believe that these kind of products will immediately be affordable to everyone. But after years of having so little, there is now definitely a feeling of great demand,"" she said. Continued sectarian violence, like the car bombings that killed at least 13 people in northwestern Baghdad over the weekend, as well as stalling government infrastructure programs, mean that a flourishing mainstream consumer culture is still some way off, according to William Watts, director of operations at Dunia Frontier Consultants. ""Iraq is sitting on one of the world's largest oil reserves, so there's no question it has enormous economic potential,"" Watts said. ""However, as things stand the infrastructure is not where it needs to be."" Iraq is still struggling just to transport oil from its vast oil fields to the shipping tankers that export it to the rest of world, according to Watts. ""It all comes back to oil ... Revenue from oil constitutes around 96% of Iraq's budget, so the more money they can make from that, the more they can then spend on building roads, reliable electricity supplies and security,"" he said. ""These are the building blocks that make for a stable and attractive business environment."" Watts say that Iraq nonetheless has a historic reputation as a good place to do business, the culture of which still remains. ""Despite the last 35 years of instability, Iraqis retain their entrepreneurial instinct. They're great at making deals, diversifying their interests, working hard and solving problems,"" he said. On the other hand, Watts points out that the legacy of the Saddam era is a heaving, highly bureaucratic state, which makes conducting business slow and difficult. ""I've heard of companies who have had equipment held up in customs for eight months,"" he said. ""And getting routine work visas can be a nightmare."" Al Fahim, however, is undeterred. He explains that Paris Gallery has teamed up with the Al Handle Group, an Iraqi firm established in 1975 that he says understand the local business environment and will run the stores on a franchise basis. ""There are always problems setting up a businesses in a new country, no matter how developed it is. But there are no difficulties we can see that can't be solved,"" said Al Fahim. ""Once we've shown everyone that it can be done then I would love nothing more than to see other international firms who specialize in shopping and entertainment, moving in and helping make Iraq a happier place to live.""","Luxury jewelry, perfume and cosmetics chain store plans to open number of shops in Iraq .

"(CNN) -- Fourteen can be a time of total transformation. It is an age when gangly adolescent limbs may morph into lithe, stronger ones. It is when the first signs of adulthood -- breasts, hair (on faces and other places) -- start cropping up. Fourteen is also the soonest any child should be tackling on a football field, heading a soccer ball, or body checking an opponent on an ice hockey rink, according to a leading concussion expert. ""If kids don't have axillary (underarm) or pubic hair, they aren't ready to play,"" said Dr. Robert Cantu, a neurosurgeon at Emerson Hospital in Massachusetts and author of a new book, ""Concussion and Our Kids."" ""And I have absolutely no problem with parents who want to hold a child out for longer, say 16 or 18."" No tackling? No body checking before 14? Heading a soccer ball before 14 in soccer might be sacrificed -- if studies eventually bear out the debatable link to concussion -- but tackling and body checking essentially define football and hockey. Limit hits, limit concussions in young brains . In Cantu's words, ""These are sports in which smashing into your opponent isn't just a possibility -- it's the object of the game."" And there is some substance behind the argument for waiting until 14, says Cantu, not the least of which is protecting young, developing brains. At 14, he says, several things enhance the body's ability to protect against head trauma. Before 14, there is a size disparity between the head and the body, causing what concussion experts call a ""bobble-head"" effect -- the head snaps back dramatically after it is hit. ""Our youngsters have big heads on very weak necks and that combination sets up the brain for greater injury,"" said Cantu, a clinical professor of neurosurgery at Boston University School of Medicine. However, around age 14, a child's skull is about 90% the size of an adult's, and the neck and body are strong enough to steel the head against the force of a blow, according to Cantu. The more developed the neck muscles, the less dramatically the head (and thus the brain) is rocked after a tackle or a body check. And then there is the issue of brain development, and a protein called myelin. Myelin acts as insulation, a sort of buffer, for nerve fibers in the brain. Football player: Are you OK ruining a kid's brain for this game? By 14, Cantu says children have a ""better myelin-ated"" brain, making them less vulnerable to injury. Of course, such a bold proposition, one that would effectively change the way sports are played, causes a minor stir among experts. ""I don't know what is magic about the number 14,"" said Dr. Julian Bailes, co-director of the NorthShore Neurological Institute. ""People suggest radical solutions, but is it practical? Is it going to be done?"" Bailes acknowledges the debate as complicated. On one hand is a real need to protect children, on the other the unavoidable and possibly insurmountable cultural questions that enter the discussion. ""What does the sporting public want and what is something we can really accomplish?"" said Bailes, who also is chairman of the Pop Warner medical advisory board. ""As a society, as sporting fans and participants, are we ready to say we're not going to play football?"" Apart from the cultural implications of placing broad limits on contact, there also is the question of what age-specific limits on hitting actually imply about a child's long-term risk for brain damage. There is no definitive set of risk factors for diseases like chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a dementia-like illness that is associated with blows to the head -- although cases as young as 17 have been identified -- and no clues yet from the scientific community about when and precisely how it starts. Suicide linked to brain disease . And then there is the pesky question of science. ""I would very clearly disagree with the concept that there is research to support (no contact before age 14),"" said Dr. Jeffrey Kutcher, chair of the Sports Neurology Section of the American Academy of Neurology. ""I don't feel like we need to have all the science lined up before we make policy decisions, but those decisions should be made based on common sense and science rather than randomness."" Yet even Kutcher has difficulty dismissing the idea outright. The reality, he says, is that brains don't like to be hit a lot and younger brains are still developing, which could cause problems down the road. Kutcher says he advocates ""diminishing versus outlawing"" head contact, adding that waiting to tackle until age 14 sounds arbitrary. ""Some of the sports we've introduced children to involve hundreds of hits to the head,"" said Chris Nowinski, a concussion expert and author of ""Head Games."" ""Show me the scientific evidence that that's a good idea."" What everyone seems to agree about is that hits to the developing brain are bad; that agreement can dissolve once the emotionally charged conversation about the sanctity of sport begins. ""I would love to debate anyone, anytime, anywhere about this,"" said Cantu. ""What the other side will say is you have to teach the kids the skills of a sport at a very young age otherwise they're at a competitive disadvantage. It's just plain B.S."" ""I'm pro-sports. I just want them to be played more safely,"" said Cantu, adding that youth athletes have the least-experienced coaches and few medical personnel on the sidelines, putting them at a compelling disadvantage. What he wants is for parents to carefully consider the potential long-term consequences of brain blows in their children -- to advocate for their safety. ""Reform should be happening much faster at the youth level than it does,"" said Nowinski, who is co-founder of the Sports Legacy Institute with Cantu. ""We're saying wake up, your child has so many disadvantages. ""Your kids only have one life and you should think twice about putting your kid in a sport where they're hitting their head repeatedly."" As for the magic number 14? Cantu says that age matters less than maturity and that parents might even decide to wait until after age 14 to expose their children to contact. ""The mantra of the book is that no head trauma is good head trauma,"" said Cantu. The brain cannot be conditioned to take head trauma so make it as little as possible."" Questions lingers about long-term impact of subtle hits to the head .","Concussion expert says kids shouldn't be tackling, body checking until 14 .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- AEG Live co-CEO Paul Gongaware, whose career as a concert promoter started with Elvis Presley's last tour, testified Tuesday about Michael Jackson's final days. ""I was working on the Elvis tour when he died so I kind of knew what to expect,"" Gongaware wrote in an e-mail to a friend two weeks after Jackson died. ""Still quite a shock."" Gongaware, who was one of the top producers of Jackson's comeback concerts, is expected to be on the witness stand for several days in the fifth week of the Michael Jackson wrongful death trial. Janet Jackson, the late singer's youngest sister, made her first appearance in the Los Angeles courtroom, sitting next to her mother, Katherine Jackson. Sister Rebbie and brother Randy Jackson are in the courthouse but are not allowed to view the testimony because the judge has limited the family to one sibling at a time in court. Jackson's mother and children are suing AEG Live for liability in the pop icon's death, accusing the concert promoter of negligently hiring, retaining or supervising Dr. Conrad Murray, the physician convicted of involuntary manslaughter. AEG lawyers contend that Michael Jackson chose, hired and supervised Murray and that his bad decisions were fueled by a drug addiction their executives had no way of knowing about. AEG exec called Jackson ""freak"" before signing concert contract . The Elvis connection . Elvis' name came up as Jackson lawyer Brian Panish questioned Gongaware about his knowledge of drug use during concert tours. He should have been able to recognize red flags signaling Jackson's drug use because of his experience with Presley and his time as Jackson's tour manager in the 1990s, the Jacksons contend. ""I kind of knew what was going to happen, yes,"" Gongaware testified. Panish then showed jurors the e-mail in which he made a similar statement. When Gongaware was managing Jackson's 1993 tour, he warned the tour doctor ""Don't be a Dr. Nick"" -- a reference to Presley's last physician -- the doctor testified in a deposition. ""Dr. Nick was the doctor whose overprescription of drugs to Elvis had led to Elvis' death,"" according to a court filing by lawyers for the Jackson family. Presley collapsed in the bathroom of his Memphis, Tennessee, mansion -- Graceland -- on August 16, 1977, at age 42. While his death was ruled the result of an irregular heartbeat, the autopsy report was sealed amid accusations that the abuse of prescription drugs caused the problem. ""Dr. Nick"" -- Dr. George Nichopoulos -- said later he was treating Presley for insomnia. He was charged with overprescribing drugs to Presley, but he was acquitted. He later lost his medical license in another case. Jackson died on June 25, 2009, at age 50. The coroner ruled his death was caused by a fatal combination of sedatives and the surgical anesthetic propofol. Murray told investigators he gave Jackson nightly infusions of propofol to treat his insomnia. He was convicted of involuntary manslaughter, sentenced to four years in prison and stripped of his medical license. Sweet controversy at Jackson death trial . Gongaware was with Presley manager Col. Tom Parker when he first met Jackson in Las Vegas, he testified. The Jackson lawyers are using Gongaware's Elvis and ""Dr. Nick"" reference to argue that ""AEG knew Jackson had suffered chronic substance abuse and drug dependency problems for many years."" ""Shortly after he joined the 'Dangerous' tour in 1993, Dr. Finkelstein was asked to treat Jackson for pain,"" the Jackson filing said, referring to Dr. Stuart Finkelstein, a doctor on the 1993 tour. ""Having observed signs of opiate addiction in Jackson, Dr. Finkelstein nonetheless administered Demerol by injection, and administered morphine intravenously in Jackson's Bangkok hotel room for 24 hours."" After that, Finkelstein told Gongaware ""he thought Jackson had an opiate dependency problem,"" the filing said. ""For three and a half months, the 'Dangerous' tour continued,"" it said. ""Another doctor attended Jackson regularly, on one occasion breaking into Dr. Finkelstein's bag to get opiates to administer to Jackson. Gongaware was there the whole time, in charge of tour logistics, aware of the various physicians present, and he discussed with Dr. Finkelstein Jackson's opiate problem."" When Gongaware warned Dr. Finkelstein, whom the brief described as his ""close friend,"" not to become Jackson's ""Dr. Nick,"" he was ""warning me, you know, don't get all infatuated where you start administering meds to a rock star and have the rock star overdose and die on you,"" Dr. Finkelstein testified. Despite working as a tour promoter for 37 years -- including for Led Zeppelin, the Grateful Dead and many others -- Gongaware testified that the only artist he ever knew that was using drug on tour was Rick James. Gongaware is currently the tour manager for the Rolling Stones North American tour. Fooling Mikey? Jurors were shown several e-mails from Gongaware that Jackson lawyers suggested were evidence that AEG Live deliberately misled Jackson about how much money he would make from his comeback concerts and how many days he would have to rest between shows. Gongaware wrote to his boss, AEG Live President Randy Phillips, that they should present gross ticket sales numbers to Jackson, not the percentage of the net profits, during contract talks. ""Maybe gross is a better number to throw around if we use numbers with Mikey listening,"" his e-mail said. He sent an e-mail to his assistant in March 2009 suggesting that she design a concert calendar for Jackson using light tan colors for show dates, while drawing attention to his rest days. ""I don't want the shows to stand out so much when MJ looks at it. Less contrast between work and off. Maybe off days in a contrasting soft color. Put 'OFF' in each off day after July 8, as well. Figure it out so it looks like he's not working so much."" Under questioning Tuesday, Gongaware said he ""wasn't trying to fool him. I wanted to present it in the best possible light."" The 'smoking gun' Gongaware is also a key witness because he wrote what Jackson's lawyers call the ""smoking gun"" e-mail which they argue shows AEG Live executives used Murray's fear of losing his lucrative job as Jackson's personal physician to pressure him to have Jackson ready for rehearsals despite his fragile health. Gongaware's e-mail to show director Kenny Ortega, sent 11 days before Jackson's death, addressed concerns that Murray had kept Jackson from a rehearsal the day before: ""We want to remind (Murray) that it is AEG, not MJ, who is paying his salary. We want to remind him what is expected of him."" Gongaware, in a video deposition played in court on the first day of the trial, said he could not remember writing the e-mail. E-mails become key . ""They put Dr. Murray in a position where if he said Michael can't go or can't play, if he said I can't give you those drugs, then he doesn't get paid,"" Jackson lawyer Brian Panish told jurors in his opening statements. AEG lawyer Marvin Putnam said in his opening statement that Gongaware and other AEG executives had no way of knowing about Jackson's use of propofol to sleep. ""AEG knew nothing about this decade-long propofol use,"" Putnam said. ""They were a concert promoter. How could they know?"" Gongaware will also face questions about an e-mail in which he seemed to question Jackson's commitment to his ""This Is It"" tour. ""We cannot be forced into stopping this, which MJ will try to do because he is lazy and constantly changes his mind to fit his immediate wants,"" he wrote to AEG's Phillips. Jackson makeup artist Karen Faye testified earlier abut an incident in which Gongaware became frustrated because Jackson locked himself in a bathroom at his home, refusing to leave for rehearsals at the Forum. Gongaware was ""angry and kind of desperate to get Michael to the Forum,"" Faye said. She overheard Gongaware screaming on the phone at Jackson's security guard, telling him ""to get him out of the bathroom. Do you have a key? Do whatever it takes."" Choreographer: AEG considered 'pulling the plug' on Jackson comeback . 'Trouble at the Front' Jackson lawyers are also expected to ask Gongaware about e-mails he received that raised questions about Jackson's health in the last weeks of his life. ""This Is It"" production director John ""Bugzee"" Houghdahl wrote to him on June 19, 2009 -- six days before Jackson died -- ""I have watched him deteriorate in front of my eyes over the last 8 weeks. He was able to do multiple 360 spins back in April. He'd fall on his ass if he tried now."" Houghdahl's e-mail, titled ""trouble at the Front"" was written after Ortega sent Jackson home from a rehearsal because of his strange behavior. ""He was a basket case and Kenny was concerned he would embarrass himself on stage, or worse yet -- get hurt,"" Houghdahl wrote. ""The company is rehearsing right now, but the DOUBT is pervasive.""

"(CNN) -- A former FBI special agent in New York and two Connecticut men have been charged for their alleged roles in a bribery scheme to dig up confidential information about a key figure in Bangladeshi politics, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan said. Robert Lustyik, 50, was arrested Friday on an allegation that he and a childhood friend, Johannes Thaler, 49, solicited cash from a third man in exchange for documents and information to which Lustyik had access to because of his FBI job. The third man was identified as Rizve Ahmed, 34, also known as ""Caesar."" Ahmed is an acquaintance of Thaler, both of whom live in Connecticut. Lustyik's lawyer, Raymond Mansolillo, on Saturday challenged the investigation, which involved the Department of Justice's public integrity unit, and insisted his client was innocent. At that time, Lustyik was still being held in Utah, his lawyer said. ""We're going to fight the charges,"" Mansolillo said. ""My client is eager to go to trial."" According to the four-count criminal complaint, which was unsealed Friday, Lustyik was working for the FBI in its White Plains, New York, office in September 2011, when he became involved in the scheme, which continued until March 2012. It alleges that Ahmed, a native of Bangladesh, was seeking confidential law enforcement information, including a confidential Suspicious Activity Report, about a prominent citizen of his country affiliated with a rival political party. The complaint identifies that person only as ""Individual 1."" ""Ahmed sought, among other things, to obtain information about Individual 1, to locate Individual 1, and to harm Individual 1 and others associated with Individual 1,"" the complaint says. Ahmed paid at least $1,000 to the two other men for information that included a suspicious activity report, according to the complaint. Citing text messages as evidence, it says that Lustyik and Thaler discussed pressuring Ahmed to fork over extra money for the information. ""We need to push (Ahmed) for this meeting and get that 40gs quick .... I will talk us into getting the cash .... I will work my magic .... We r sooooooo close"", says Lustyik in one exchange, which occurred in late December 2011 or early January 2012, according to the complaint. Thaler is said to have responded, ""I know. It's all right there in front of us. Pretty soon we'll be having lunch in our oceanfront restaurant ...."" Around January 2012, after learning that Ahmed was considering using someone else to get the information, Lustyik allegedly sent this text to Thaler: ""I want to kill (Ahmed) .... I hung my ass out the window n we got nothing? .... Tell (Ahmed), I've got (Individual 1's) number and I'm pissed .... I will put a wire on n get (Ahmed and his associates) to admit they want (a Bangladeshi political figure) offed n we sell it to (Individual 1.)"" The complaint charges all three men with conspiracy to bribe a public official; it charges Thaler and Lustyik with soliciting and receiving bribes; it charges Ahmed with bribing a public official and offering to bribe a public official; and it charges Lustyik with unlawfully disclosing a suspicious activity report. If convicted, Lustyik faces a maximum prison sentence of 25 years; Thaler and Ahmed each face a maximum of 20 years. A call to Thaler's residence was not immediately returned; CNN was not able to contact Ahmed. In a statement on a website seeking funds for his legal defense, Lustyik's family described him as ""a highly decorated"" agent with more than 24 years of service in the counterintelligence division, and said he had been ""wrongfully accused.""

"(CNN) -- A cruise can be a stress-free escape from day-to-day life, promising all-you-can-eat buffets and nightly entertainment at a reasonable price. But some high-profile incidents aboard ship have led to rough sailing for some cruise lines, with a new survey showing that 18% of passengers report experiencing a problem on their trip -- and walking away unsatisfied. Nevertheless, overall customer satisfaction with cruise lines remains high, according to the survey from J.D. Power and Associates. Conducting its first report on cruise line consumer satisfaction, the global market research company wanted to see how the industry ranked in customer service relations after a series of events that captured headlines. Among the recent bad news: The Costa Concordia hit a reef off the coast of Italy in January 2012, killing 32 people. Then there was February's Carnival Triumph cruise, which experienced an engine fire in the control room that led to a loss of electrical power for five days. In May, Royal Caribbean's Grandeur of the Seas caught fire, forcing the ship to cut short the trip. ""It is important for cruise line companies to understand their strengths and weaknesses in the service they provide to their passengers,"" says Ramez Faza, senior account manager of the global travel and hospitality practice at J.D Power. ""Cruises in general are not something you get on to go from point A to point B,"" Faza says. ""It's more for the experience."" Problems on cruise ships can vary from complications with a passenger's food to the steward being late to clean your cabin, says Carolyn Spencer Brown, editor-in-chief of Cruise Critic. Five things we've learned about cruising . Disney Cruise Line, Royal Caribbean International and Holland America Line came in first, second and third, respectively, in customer satisfaction, while Carnival ranked last in the report of eight cruise lines. The survey measured seven factors that affect a customer's experience: service, state of the room, food, the efficiency of boarding and departing on the ship, entertainment, cost and excursions. ""When you're on ship for a long time, there are bound to be problems,"" Faza says. ""I think the biggest thing as a company is the ability to recover."" When Royal Caribbean's Grandeur of the Seas had a fire in May, the cruise line didn't waste time in notifying customers of its recovery plan. Less than an hour after the fire was extinguished, company representatives tweeted details that passengers would receive a full refund of the fare paid and a certificate for future sailing. Though cruise lines are catering to the majority of their passengers' needs, Faza says the firms need to be more aware of positive and negative feedback and work on customer retention. Customers are often voicing their opinions regarding service through social media. ""The ability to voice your opinion has made a huge impact,"" Faza says. ""It's important for companies to even address these opinions and acknowledge their customers for the good and bad comments.""","Survey ranks Disney Cruise Line highest in customer satisfaction, Carnival the lowest .

"(CNN) -- A Florida prosecutor said his office will ""get to the bottom"" of a sexual assault case investigation involving Florida State University quarterback Jameis Winston. A lawyer for the FSU star said his client will cooperate with authorities even though he believed the case had been closed for months. In an interview Friday, State Attorney Willie Meggs said his office learned of the case on Wednesday. ""What we're going to try to do is to get to the bottom of it and try to do justice,"" he said. Meggs, state attorney for Florida's 2nd Judicial Circuit, said he believed the case could have been handled differently, but he did not offer specifics. The latest development in the case comes as No. 2 FSU plays its homecoming game against Syracuse on Saturday. Winston is a candidate for the Heisman Trophy, college football's top award. The sexual assault complaint was filed in December. Winston's lawyer, Tim Jansen, said the red-shirt freshman has not been questioned by police as part of the investigation. Jansen said police in Tallahassee told him in February the case had been closed. ""I informed my client, I informed the university, that the matter was resolved, and we all moved forward,"" Jansen said. But Meggs said the case is not closed. ""There's people who needed to be located and talked to and, to the best of my knowledge, they haven't been,"" the prosecutor said. Meggs said, ""The most important thing here is, we do have a victim in the case. Victims have rights. We don't pick our victims, nor do we pick our suspects. They are who they are and I think our job is to do the right thing with the case."" Tallahassee Police have released a heavily redacted police report documenting a sexual assault allegation. Jansen would not comment on the document, but said his client's name ""has been intermingled"" with the investigation. No one has been charged in the investigation. Calls made Friday for comment from the Tallahassee Police Department were not immediately returned. Winston's name does not appear in the redacted version of the complaint, dated December 7, and a suspect description includes a height ranging between 5-foot-9 and 5-foot-11, several inches shorter than the 6-foot-4 quarterback. Meggs said, ""If I were you all, I wouldn't put too much into a redacted police report."" Jansen said he had given investigators sworn statements from witnesses ""that we believe are favorable to Mr. Winston,"" and those witnesses had been interviewed by police. Meggs confirmed that his office received two affidavits from Jansen but had not yet interviewed the witnesses. Georgia Cappleman, the Leon County chief assistant state's attorney, said police delivered the case to her office on Tuesday. ""I am not aware of it being closed nor did my office ask that it be reopened,"" Cappleman said. ""I do not know the reason the case was not presented sooner. I cannot confirm any suspects or comment on the evidence, as it is a pending investigation."" Florida State said it could not comment on an open investigation, but said there was no change in Winston's status. ""We look forward to a speedy resolution of the issue,"" a school statement added. Jansen said the report had been leaked to reporters in the past week, timing he called ""very suspect."" FSU is a national title contender, and Heisman voting takes place in early December: ""Any kind of negative can affect that,"" he said .","Florida prosecutor takes on case of December 2012 incident .

"(CNN) -- When I think about the importance of voting, I think about kids and what kind of opportunities they are going to have in life. I've been lucky enough to have incredible opportunities that allowed me to lead a wonderful, successful life even prior to my fortunate career in the entertainment business. The Comprehensive Employment and Training Act allowed me to work by the age of 12, helping me develop a strong work ethic. Without government financial aid I would have never been able to attend college and along the way, bump into Spike Lee, who offered me my very first role in ""Do the Right Thing."" Being an actress, I've had the opportunity to work with poor students, helping to provide arts-intergrated education programs for the past 19 years, working with many young students in Harlem, the Bronx, Brooklyn and the Lower East Side of Manhattan. I am inspired to support young people who want a future in the arts and in jobs that will make their communities better. I found that these students have incredible dreams for their future. But their dreams could be shattered if we elect the wrong candidates -- people who will pursue policies that do nothing for kids. The young people I work with come from underprivileged backgrounds. They work hard. They want to achieve the American Dream. And the American Dream is about providing opportunities for all -- rich and poor. Many of them are the children of immigrants who brought them here when they were little, some documented and some not. Until recently, these students had to live in constant fear of being deported to another country, even though America is where they grew up and is the only home they have ever known. Some of that fear was lifted when President Barack Obama announced earlier this year that the government will not deport young people who were brought here as children and are currently in school, have graduated from high school or obtained a GED, or have been honorably discharged from the armed forces. Here's why voting matters. After the new policy was announced, Mitt Romney's senior adviser, Ed Gillespie, said to CNN that if the Republican nominee is elected, this new policy will be ""subject to review and repeal."" That statement brought tears to my eyes. I thought about an applicant to our organization's scholarship program -- a straight-A student whose sole dream is to become a lawyer. She was accepted to multiple Ivy League colleges but could not apply because she was not able to qualify for funding as an undocumented young person. She is thinking of going to John Jay College of Criminal Justice because it is the only place she can barely afford $6,000 a year. But this could still fall through without financial assistance. She would be forced to choose between housing and food, or a degree in law. Even if she does attend college, she will be jeopardizing her stay in the United States as an undocumented person once she enrolls because she has no idea if the policy will remain intact or be rescinded. She is as American as anyone else, but her parents immigrated here when she was very young. She is now terrified that the new policy will be repealed. She is afraid of being deported. But what terrified her even more, she said, was that she may never become a lawyer. It's especially important for people who care about kids and education to vote, because too many of our political leaders are just out of touch with these everyday realities. Mitt Romney recently suggested -- at a private dinner for wealthy donors who each paid $50,000 to be there -- that it would be easier for him to be elected president if he were Latino. As if his privileged background as the son of a millionaire corporate CEO who sent him to Harvard and Harvard Law School was some kind of disadvantage in life. ""My dad, as you probably know, was the governor of Michigan and was the head of a car company,"" Romney said. ""But he was born in Mexico, and had he been born of Mexican parents, I'd have a better shot at winning this... But he was unfortunately born to Americans living in Mexico... I say that jokingly, but it would be helpful to be Latino."" Maybe Romney thinks it's ""easier"" because he thinks we're all living off of government handouts, or because Jimmy Smits won the election on ""The West Wing,"" or because he's a cynical leader who thinks that optics matter more than policies. But we're not fooled that easily. Watch: Rosie Perez's video response to Mitt Romney's comments . Romney also said that he is not concerned about ""47%"" of Americans. As we take in the devastation of Hurricane Sandy, we have to ask: What if it happens again and Mitt is elected? What will the ""47%"" do if they have to deal with a major disaster without FEMA, without government help? When I heard what Romney said, I realized that I needed to do more to encourage every citizen to vote in this election. I'm going to vote because I want elected officials who understand and can relate to the obstacles that young people and their parents face every day. I'm going to vote because it hurts all of us when at least 11 million hardworking people in this country are vulnerable to exploitation by their employers simply because our government denies them a path to citizenship. Most of all, I'm going to vote because I believe in an America that provides liberty and justice for all, and I want every child to have the opportunity to pursue the American Dream. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Rosie Perez.","Rosie Perez: Young people's dreams can be shattered if we elect the wrong politicians .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- As Chinese Communist Party chief Xi Jinping formally succeeds Hu Jintao as state president at the 12th National People's Congress (NPC) in Beijing, it completes what has been a seemingly smooth transition of power in the world's most populous nation. But who is he? As with all Chinese leaders, details of the Xi's life are tightly controlled, creating a gap that biographies -- some written under pseudonyms, given the political sensitivities -- have sought to fill. China watchers meanwhile try to discern how he would lead. ""Chinese leaders don't rise to the top telegraphing what changes they'll do,"" said Bruce J. Dickson, a political science professor at George Washington University's Elliott School of International Affairs. ""They rise to the top showing how loyal they are to the incumbent. What they'll do when they rise to the top -- that's the big question."" Xi was born in 1953, four years after the Chinese Communist Party defeated the ruling Nationalists and established the People's Republic of China. He is the son of the second marriage of Xi Zhongxun, a revolutionary hero whom then-paramount leader Mao Zedong would appoint minister of propaganda and education. Xi Zhongxun would later become vice premier under Zhou Enlai and secretary general of the State Council, China's highest administrative body, before being purged in 1962. Until then, Xi Jinping had grown up a ""princeling"" with other children of China's first generation of leaders in the enclave of power in Beijing known as Zhongnanhai. One childhood peer was Bo Xilai, son of Bo Yibo, the first finance minister who was also purged during the Cultural Revolution. Life was comfortable and far removed from the mass starvation during Mao's disastrous ""Great Leap Forward"" campaign (1958-1962), which was designed to transform the nation into an industrial society. However, a few years later, Xi -- his father by then deposed -- would be among 30 million ""sent-down youth,"" forced to leave cities for the countryside and mountains under another of Mao's policies. From 1969-1975, or most of the Cultural Revolution, Xi was an agricultural laborer in Liangjiahe, Shaanxi, his ancestral province. ""That generation went through a lot of difficulties,"" said Cheng Li, director of research at the John L. Thornton Center at the Brookings Institution. ""Idealism and pragmatism in a very unique way combined in this generation."" The experience had a positive influence on Xi's view of China and the world, according to Guo Yanjun, chairman of CNHK Media, the publisher of ""China's Future: A Biography of Xi Jinping."" ""Even after he became a leader, he helped farmers,"" Guo said. His favorite story was of the Tsinghua University-bound Xi in 1975 being accompanied by villagers who walked 60 li (30 km) to send him off at a train station. When Mao died in 1976, Xi's father was subsequently rehabilitated and became party secretary of Guangdong, where he oversaw China's first special economic zones near Hong Kong -- reforms that would define then paramount leader Deng Xiaoping's economic legacy. The elder Xi's connections proved critical. After graduating from Tsinghua with a chemical engineering degree in 1979, Xi Jinping became the personal secretary to his father's former comrade-in-arms, Geng Biao, and became an active military service member. As vice premier, a member of the Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee and secretary general of the Central Military Commission, Geng ""dominated the Party, government and the army,"" according to ""China's Future,"" affording Xi a rare vantage point. Such military ties -- familial and professional -- give him what neither Hu nor his predecessor Jiang Zemin had, said Chi Wang, president of the U.S.-China Policy Foundation. ""The military takes him as one of the family members."" It was around this period that Xi was married to his first wife, Ke Lingling, the daughter of Ke Hua, China's ambassador to Great Britain and a former underling of Xi Zhongxun, according to ""China's Future."" Not much is known about the marriage except that it ended in divorce within a few years. In 1987, Xi would marry his current wife, Peng Liyuan, a popular folk singer for the People's Liberation Army. Read how Xi is considered a ""mystery"" In 1982, when his father entered the ruling Politburo and the Secretariat, Xi became county deputy secretary in Zhengding, Hebei province, his first experience in rural politics. In this role, he took his first trip to the United States -- as part of an agricultural delegation in 1985 to Hebei's ""sister state"" of Iowa -- and brought back knowledge of farming technology as well as tourism. This trip had a great impact on Xi, who stayed with a family in Muscatine, said Pin Ho, chairman of Mirror Books, which recently published a separate ""Biography of Xi Jinping."" ""Vocally, he's a nationalist. Psychologically, he greatly hopes to keep good relations with the West, especially the U.S.,"" Ho said, noting that Xi's daughter, Xi Mingze, studies there -- at Harvard -- under a pseudonym. In a major policy speech in Washington in February 2012, Xi called for increasing strategic trust and reducing suspicions while respecting each other's core interests, such as the ""One China policy"" that opposes Taiwan and Tibetan independence. In an indirect reference to the Obama administration's ""rebalancing"" strategy toward Asia, Xi said, ""We hope the United States will respect the interests and concerns of China and other countries in the region."" Nonetheless, Xi got high marks for his desire to engage with the United States, and his trip included meetings with President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta. Also not overlooked was the fact Xi chose to make a nostalgic stop in Iowa, in addition to Los Angeles, during his five-day U.S. tour. ""From my conversations with people in the United States, the reigning understanding is, 'This is a guy we can work with,'"" said David Lampton, director of the China Studies Program at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. Wang of the U.S.-China Policy Foundation echoed the sentiments, calling Xi ""relaxed, very at ease to talk with people"" and a departure from Communist leaders who tend to be ""very cautious"" when talking. Read about how U.S., China are worlds apart but joined . Meanwhile, ""Xi's leadership experience [after Zhengding] in running Fujian, Zhejiang, and Shanghai, three economically-advanced regions, has prepared him well for pursuing policies to promote the development of the private sector, foreign investment and trade, and the liberalization of China's financial system,"" wrote Cheng Li of Brookings for the Washington Quarterly in its winter 2012 edition. The run-up to Xi's ascension as China's next leader has nonetheless been bumpy. In September, his nearly two-week ""disappearance"" -- and canceled meetings with Clinton and other foreign officials -- fueled speculation over his health and factional infighting. In an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, former Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa said Xi had suffered a back injury while swimming. Even so, the Chinese media's ""default mode"" of not speaking about its leaders, coupled with the lack of a constitutional basis for the regime's transfer of power, left people wondering, ""What's the Plan B if something were to happen?"" Lampton said. Also of note were two reports released by Xinhua on September 28 within three minutes of each other: the Congress' November 8 opening date -- after much speculation it would fall in October -- and the expulsion of Bo Xilai from the Communist Party. Bo now faces criminal prosecution in the wake of a scandal that saw his wife convicted of murder. The clean reputation of Xi -- who had become Shanghai's leader after his predecessor, Chen Liangyu, was dismissed over a social security fund scandal -- took a hit last June when Bloomberg reported on the wealth of his extended family. Although no assets were traced to Xi, his wife or daughter, Bloomberg found that his extended family had business interests in minerals, real estate and mobile-phone equipment, with assets in the hundreds of millions. In October the New York Times gave a similar treatment to Premier Wen Jiabao, reporting on the staggering wealth of his relatives -- a review that found assets of at least $2.7 billion. Xi and the new leaders will have to demonstrate to the public how serious they are in fighting widespread corruption, Lampton said, or face ""huge problems.""","As with all Chinese leaders, government tightly controls details of Xi's life .

"(CNN) -- Forget space. The most exciting new frontiers of exploration are on our very own planet, says Dr. Robin Hanbury-Tenison, one of the greats of British exploring. ""I'm excited about this planet and what we don't know about it,"" he says. ""To discover life that has been cut off for 25 million years under the Antarctic ice cap is just mind-blowing and much more exciting than finding life on Mars,"" he says. Hanbury-Tenison OBE and an honorary Doctor of Science from Plymouth University, sees three new frontiers of exploration: the tropical rainforest canopy, which researchers are beginning to access by hot air balloon and which is teeming with new species; caves (only 10% of the world's caves have been discovered); and coral reefs, which are revealing more of their secrets thanks to smart technology. The key to exploring these new frontiers is science. Explore, don't tour . For Hanbury-Tenison, who has led more than 30 expeditions over the last 60 years, the thrill of reaching a place and taking a few trophy photographs isn't enough. ""What is a turn-on is stepping over the threshold from being a tourist to being an explorer-scientist. Then you are actually contributing to saving the world, to enlightening people to what is wrong and campaigning,"" says the 77-year-old, who has written more than 20 books on his adventures, most recently ""The Modern Explorers."" He's not suggesting it's easy to make the leap from tourist to explorer, but it's possible if you're smart about it. First, you have to know what you're talking about, which means reading as much as you can about your chosen destination. ""Provided you always treat people with respect, integrate and live as near to the way locals are living and not bring in too much from the outside world, you can do good rather than the sort of damage mass tourism does,"" he says. There are plenty of places still to be explored on Earth, ranging from ""explorer light"" to ""hardcore explorer."" If you want to get involved and contribute to scientific exploration, lacking a science degree isn't an obstacle as long as you're prepared to work hard and be humble, he says. How to become an explorer . Hanbury-Tenison says many of the world's research centers will open their doors if you approach them in the right way. ""If you want to be an explorer, go to one of these research stations, they have amazing ones in Peru, and say, 'I'll sweep the laboratory floor but can I come back when you look for the giant otters and I'll paddle the boat.' Make yourself useful."" Some wannabe explorers yearn for the days when the world was a pristine planet and great Victorian explorers such as Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace went off on journeys and returned with mountains of exciting new material and stories. But Hanbury-Tenison says there's much more of the Earth left to explore and species to discover and that the mission is more important now than ever. ""It doesn't matter if people have been there before, it isn't about being the first -- it's about understanding and learning more about it. ""And that's more urgent now than ever. We're cutting down the rainforests and destroying them before we've discovered how exciting and interesting it all is.""

"(CNN) -- Police nabbed him just as he was boarding a plane to travel from Texas to Europe, but Michael Todd Wolfe's final destination was Syria, where he planned to join violent jihad in the ranks of ISIS, prosecutors said. On Friday, Wolfe, also known as ""Faruq,"" pleaded guilty to ""attempting to provide material support and resources to a foreign terrorist organization,"" said U.S. attorney Robert Pitman. The 23-year-old from Austin faces up to 15 years behind bars for his plans to join the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, a terror organization so violent it has been shunned by al Qaeda. Wolfe acquired a passport so he could travel abroad. He had trained for the battle with the help of military and physical fitness exercises and was looking for a contact to help him slip into Syria, the prosecutor's office said. That contact turned out to be an FBI official. On February 2, an undercover agent met with Wolfe and his wife and they watched a YouTube video about foreign fighters in Syria, officials said. Wolfe allegedly discussed ISIS' activities. ""While watching the video, Wolfe occasionally stopped the video to explain the current allegiances of the various groups fighting in Syria. They include ISIS, al Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra, the Free Syria Army, and Dawla,"" a complaint said. A second suspect . A second Texas man, Rahatul Ashikim Khan, 23, of Round Rock, was arrested earlier this month in a separate case at his home and charged with ""conspiring to provide material support to terrorists."" A complaint said Khan ""conspired with others to recruit persons to travel overseas to support terrorist activities including committing violent jihad"" during a period from early 2011 to January 2012.

"(CNN) -- There I was, having an epiphany. I had just run close to 3 miles with my 24-year-old son, and wishing I had been in better shape to enjoy more activities with my kids when they were younger. Why did I wait so long to get healthier? How much did I miss out on by not taking the time to take care of myself? Training for a triathlon has made me aware of the side benefits of exercise -- benefits that expand past the point of gaining strength and losing fat. I have never been particularly goal-driven; I seemed to thrive by getting through life ""by the seat of my pants."" But this year I have realized the benefit of having goals, both large and small, and of working to achieve those goals. What a motivation boost it is to see how much progress I have made, especially in my running. When I first started running in January, I couldn't make a half-lap around a high school track without getting winded. Yesterday, after bike riding for almost an hour and a half, I was able to run over two miles in 30 minutes. There is no way I would have been able to progress to that point without goals and coaching. This side benefit has bled into my professional life. By setting small goals, I feel that I am better able to focus on tasks and am more efficient with the demands of my workday. My ability to do athletic activities other than the three triathlon sports has improved as well, telling me that my overall fitness and coordination have improved. My job in the hospital can involve a great deal of walking, lifting and twisting. I can now work a 12-hour shift and finish with more energy than I would have before I started training. That dying patient could have been me . My wife has gotten into biking and running with me. We both agreed that whatever happens, we cannot stop what we are doing after the triathlon. Not only do we not want to lose our momentum, we both have enjoyed the journey, supporting and encouraging each other along the way. Even my golf swing feels better (though anything would have been an improvement!) I am turning 50 in July, but I don't feel 50. Other than the occasional soreness that comes after a workout, I don't have the aches and pains of middle age. I sleep so much better than I did years ago. Some have told me that I don't look like I am that old -- what a shot of confidence that gives me! Since beginning training, I don't feel irritable toward the world; I actually enjoy each day as it comes. It has been a long time since I have felt depressed or discouraged. Before you call me Pollyanna, know that I am not always the happy-go-lucky guy I would like to be every second of the day. But I do think that because I am exercising my body, my mind benefits as well. The negatives of life can be met with a better attitude and fresh perspective. How we approach the events of life often determine their outcome. If I come to a bump in the road grumpy, sluggish and depressed, how much more severe is that bump going to be? I have come to realize that life is too short to needlessly suffer the consequences of inactivity and procrastination. Get out there and do something -- something you enjoy. Give yourself the gift of a better day by making an effort to strengthen your body and improve your mind. You are fearfully and wonderfully made; take advantage of that and follow me and the rest of Fit Nation Sassy Six as we work to live the second half of our lives better than the first.

"(CNN) -- My friends have always told me that rock stardom was wasted on me. To them it seemed that being a rock star was a free ticket to debauchery. It was sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll, and I was only taking advantage of two. Drugs were not a part of my rock 'n' roll lifestyle. I wasn't even much of a drinker. I have never thrown up from being over intoxicated. What kind of rock star is that? I had certainly encountered drugs during the '80s, mostly cocaine, but nothing about grinding my teeth and rambling on about myself appealed to me. During the '90s, I smoked an occasional joint. Those were usually fun social occasions. My work was a drug-free zone. Then in 2004, I was diagnosed with breast cancer. The chemotherapy that was prescribed was called ""dose dense"": a harsher, stronger chemo than the usual because I had the benefit of not having to work during the treatment. My close friends told me that, as an alternative, medical marijuana was a natural way to help with the excruciating side effects of chemo. It worked. The entire experience changed my life. It opened my mind to a new way of thinking about my body, my health and the future. This herb, this weed that is so strong it grows wild by the side of the road, has always been with us. In ancient times it was highly regarded and has even been found in tombs. It has even been put forth from some biblical scholars that Jesus may have used cannabis oil to heal. Now, this herb, marijuana, is at center of a debate within our society. The American Civil Liberties Union just released a report called ""The War on Marijuana in Black and White: Billions of Dollars Wasted on Racially Biased Arrests,"" which outlines why marijuana reform is necessary. Many people are being arrested and their lives affected forever, sometimes devastated, because of marijuana possession. People use marijuana for different reasons, and I needed it to get me through tough times. I used it every day during chemo: It gave me an appetite so I was able to eat and keep my strength up. It also helped with the depression, and it eased the gastrointestinal pain. I have been a medicinal marijuana smoker for nine years now. I find relief from the gastrointestinal effects of the chemo even now. I find it helps with regulating my sleep. I also enjoy it before I watch ""Game of Thrones."" Along with so many other social morals that are taking on new meanings and definitions, the stigma that has pot lumped in with heroin and other Schedule 1 opiates -- those that have ""no currently accepted medical use in the United States -- is being re-examined. The state of fear in which these laws were created has changed. Educated people have experienced pot or they understand that research has shown that while marijuana use is not entirely safe, its dangers have been grossly overstated. I am also a mother. I have teenage children and it has not been an easy journey holding the boundary between teenage abuse of marijuana and legitimate adult use. In my efforts to refrain from saying ""Do as I say not as I do,"" I have found a way to inform my children that the growing adolescent brain reacts differently to cannabis and studies have shown that the benefits an adult brain experiences are actually detrimental to the growing teenage brain. Common sense tells me that kids smoking pot is not a good idea. Just like sex, you can handle it when you are mature enough to respect it. So as a mother and a rock star I find myself asking, are we ready to trust ourselves and our children in a world where the sale and use of cannabis is legal? With the Supreme Court considering the legalization of same-sex marriage, along with the new dialogue on ending pot prohibition, we have arrived at the tipping point of understanding that true freedom is the ability of a nation to handle diversity. These days our society is experiencing a new open-mindedness. We are beginning to break away from the old fears that governed our parents' world. We do not automatically fear someone because of the color of his or her skin. We do not fear for our children if homosexuals are living in the neighborhood. And we do not fear that smoking pot will necessarily lead to a life of ruin. I believe it is time to shine a light on the old ""Reefer Madness"" fears. Let's legitimize cannabis sales so that our youth are as protected from illegal pot as they are from illegal alcohol and tobacco sales. Legitimize the growers so that pot can have regulations and I know I am supporting American businesses and not outlaws when I purchase it. The legalization of pot is making sense. It will create a real business form and take the lawlessness out of its sale and distribution. The ACLU report on racial bias in pot possession arrests is enlightening. The fact that people of color are arrested four times more often than whites is disturbing. This imbalance is coming to a head. We can be the generation that makes the change. We live in a nation that holds freedom as a sacred right. Our great Constitution challenges us to grow constantly Let's put an end to marijuana prohibition and get clear regulations on the legal sale of pot. The benefits might surprise us. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Melissa Etheridge.","Melissa Etheridge: Drugs and drinking ""were not a part of my rock 'n' roll lifestyle""

"(WIRED) -- ""I'm so happy that I don't have to be an AT&T customer."" Posted to a T-Mobile message board this morning, one user's feelings nail the sentiment among consumers following Wednesday's announcement that the Justice Department is suing to block AT&T's proposed acquisition of the Deutsche-Telekom--owned wireless network. T-Mobile users generally responded positively to the news that they wouldn't be seeing the AT&T death star on their cellphone bills anytime soon. Riffing on the oft-bemoaned shortcomings of both networks, one Wired.com reader proposed an unfortunate merger scenario: ""AT&T's zero-bars reception merged with T-Mobile's customer service. I think the result might just collapse into a black hole of suck."" AT&T has long championed its proposed merger of T-Mobile as being beneficial to the wireless customers of both networks. The company claims it will improve wireless service for AT&T and T-Mobile customers, expand 4G coverage to more of the country and, most recently, add a significant number of jobs to the U.S. workforce. But in the Justice Department's eyes -- and anecdotally those of T-Mobile's customer base as well -- the costs of the merger may outweigh the benefits. ""The combination of AT&T and T-Mobile would result in tens of millions of consumers all across the United States facing higher prices, fewer choices and lower quality products for mobile wireless services,"" said deputy attorney general James M. Cole in the Justice filing. Not to mention some of the concessions existing T-Mobile customers would have to make if the merger were to go through. AT&T has repeatedly stated it planned to use T-Mobile's 1700-MHz spectrum for its eventual 4G LTE deployment. That would ultimately make T-Mobile customers buy new phones that could function on AT&T's network -- unless, that is, you're okay with EDGE network service. Those least happy about the Justice Department's actions are, of course, AT&T and T-Mobile. In the past year, T-Mobile has seen a steady decline in profits as T-Mobile customer contracts have been reduced by nearly a million subscribers. If Deutsche Telekom were able to sell off T-Mobile to AT&T for $39 billion, the German firm could then use that money to invest in its European business. Not to mention a successful blocking of the merger would prevent AT&T's dreams of becoming the largest wireless telecommunications network in the United States, surpassing Verizon as the reigning champ and leaving Sprint in the dust. Of course, if the lawsuit fails to block the merger, today's customer rejoicing could lend itself to tomorrow's mass customer departures: ""If AT&Terrible is able to acquire them,"" wrote one T-Mobile subscriber, ""then I am outta here so fast they won't even know I existed.""

"(CNN) -- At best I'm a 5. I'm not complaining. Some of you top out at 4. Won't name names, but I've seen you walking into Great Clips. Usually when I'm walking out of Old Navy. So, we're in this thing together. But, yes, at best I'm a 5. On a good day. With poor lighting. At the Gathering of the Juggalos. And I'm totally OK with my status as a 5. Because, according to a new study, having average appearance is sexy. GQ hasn't called yet about a photo shoot, but I've laid out my very best cargo shorts just to be safe. This is all based on a theory called The Cheerleader Effect, and it originally spawned from the hit TV show ""How I Met Your Mother,"" when Neil Patrick Harris' character, Barney Stinson, explained the phenomenon to his friends while admiring patrons in a bar. Barney says, ""The Cheerleader Effect is when a group of women seems hot, but only as a group. Just like with cheerleaders. They seem hot, but take each one of them individually ... sled dogs!"" Apparently, it's all about social averaging within a group, where, somehow, the appearance of those who are ugly improves and the appearance of those who are beautiful declines into some sort of perfect middle ground. Basically, the entire group becomes an Applebee's menu, which is excitingly tasty. At first glance. But that's what we're talking about here. That initial appearance. And The Cheerleader Effect definitely applies to both sexes, as was proven by actual researchers at the University of California, San Diego where this real-life study was conducted for both men and women. The results, recently published in the journal Psychological Science, reveal that a good way to boost your overall attractiveness when out in public is to simply surround yourself with other people. Preferably with people you know. ""Heck of a bris, eh? Hi, I'm Dave."" Of course, it all seems rather obvious. In social situations, being surrounded by others makes you more desirable than being a mouth-breathing loner surrounded by self-doubt. But this study isn't about your vibe. It's about your actual appearance. The lead scientists, Drew Walker and Edward Vul, wrote that people's faces tend to ""average out"" in a group, making an individual's overall look less unique than it otherwise would be. Perfect 5s. Which doesn't necessarily sound like a good thing. But it is. According to this research, social averaging really is the key to looking good in public settings. Walker explains in the study that, ""Average faces are more attractive, likely due to the averaging out of unattractive idiosyncrasies. Perhaps it's like Tolstoy's families: Beautiful people are all alike, but every unattractive person is unattractive in their own way."" Basically, they surmise that while hanging out in a group doesn't necessarily accentuate your supposed good qualities, it does, however, minimize your less attractive features. So that weird Richard Nixon-shaped birthmark on your cheek... pfft, like it's not even there! In fact, the findings showed that people in groups were rated 5.5% more attractive than when viewed on their own. Which doesn't sound like much. But it's something. To actually test this Cheerleader Effect theory, five experiments were done with over 130 undergraduate students who were shown pictures of 100 people. They were then asked to rate their attractiveness. Some of the people in the pictures were cropped alone, and in other photos they were a part of a group. Ultimately, both women and men were found to be more attractive in the group shots. Of course, once you couple off away from the group, you're on your own and the truth comes out. ""Is that ... Richard Nixon?"" So, there's definitely some merit to the idea of a wingman, or a wingwoman. And the more of them you have, the better. Let's go bris crashing!

"Slovyansk, Ukraine (CNN) -- In a forest of pines to the east of Slovyansk, Prapor and his seventy men were digging in Thursday. A man in his late-fifties with a magnificent beard and four different weapons, Prapor freely admitted he was not a local. But he was here -- he said -- to resist the ""Ukrainian fascists"" in Krasny Liman, a nearby town just recaptured by government forces. He was dismissive of the group that had fled Krasny -- ""Cossacks,"" he sneered. He had already lost seven men, but his fighters were the bravest. They would not run away. Meeting Prapor was revealing in several ways. Pro-Russian separatists working in eastern Ukraine are better organized, better armed (Prapor's group had a truck-mounted anti-aircraft gun that was clearly working), and more of them appear to come from beyond Ukraine. And they are building a maze of roadblocks and defensive positions across the region. But a few kilometers beyond, in rolling countryside under a hot sun, a very different group was setting up camp: a substantial force of Ukrainian paratroopers, with armored personnel carriers and artillery. Above, a reconnaissance plane drifted in loops. Both sides look -- at least militarily -- more competent than they did a few weeks ago. Checkpoints used to be few and far between. Now there is a maze of them -- more separatist than Ukrainian -- dotted across both the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. The insignia of the ""Vostok Battalion"" -- a group that includes both Russian and local fighters -- is common at the roadblocks that have sprung up on the main roads leading into Donetsk. A few weeks ago, we watched the bedraggled remnants of the Ukrainian army's 25th Division surrounded and harangued by locals near Kramatorsk. Now there is a sense of purpose among the units newly deployed, and a greater readiness to use heavy armor. Throughout an extensive tour of the Slovyansk area, the crump of artillery and boom of tankfire sounded periodically. But the targeting is sometimes puzzling. Krasny Liman is a town of some 20,000 people and a major railway junction. But one of its two hospitals is in ruins, struck repeatedly by what appeared to have been mortars or shells. There was also evidence of strafing from the air. A tearful nurse approached us, saying that whoever had done this was not human. She -- and others -- thought Ukrainian forces were responsible, but they could not be sure. Patients had been evacuated, but one middle-aged man sat listlessly on a bench outside. He had nowhere to go, he told us; a doctor came past once a day to give him an injection. The new mayor, installed Thursday as Kiev's local appointee, said he would investigate the bombing of the hospital. But for the government, recovering Krasny Liman is a rare victory -- and judging by the number of troops installed around the town, one it intends to protect. Now Ukrainian armor seems intent on squeezing separatist positions closer to Slovyansk. It seems like eastern Ukraine is half-way through a game of chess, pieces scattered across the board in threatening positions, with neither black nor white close to checkmate. Civilians, whatever their allegiance, are suffering the consequences. The main highway that links Slovyansk and the Russian border, a route crowded with trucks just a few weeks ago, is deserted. In places the tarmac is chewed up by the impact of mortar fire. But once in a while an ancient, battered car lurches onto the road from a farm-track. A family has escaped from Slovyansk, where water and electricity supplies are faltering and fresh food is getting more difficult to find. The intentions of either side in this scattered war of attrition are hard to work out. Some Ukrainian analysts say that Russian President Vladimir Putin has what he wants already, a simmering insurgency that can be stoked any time Ukraine's new leader, Petro Poroshenko, looks to deepen his country's relationship with Europe and NATO. There seems to be no attempt from the Russian side to stem the growing flow of fighters crossing into Ukraine, and border clashes have intensified. As for Kiev's strategy, it's unclear as of now whether it feel its ""Anti-Terrorist Operation"" can overcome the separatists or at least redress the military balance as a precursor to negotiations. What seems unlikely is that Poroshenko will accede to the demand of the Prime Minister of the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic, Alexander Borodai, who told CNN there would be no talks until Ukrainian forces left the Donetsk and neighboring Luhansk regions. Poroshenko's message to the east in his inauguration speech Saturday will be closely scrutinized, but even ordinary people in Donetsk are suspicious of him, noting his support as a candidate for a hard line against the separatists and his threat to send the army into the city. The new President's message to the outside world will be equally critical, as he walks the tightrope between making Ukraine part of Europe -- the dream, still unrealized, that brought thousands onto the streets of Kiev in February -- and reassuring Russia that its interests in the neighborhood will be acknowledged. It is a reality he recognized when he told the Washington Post in April: ""Without a direct dialogue with Russia, it will be impossible to create security."" Creating security seems a long way off. On Thursday, a car raced out of Slovyansk and emptied a mother and her three young children on the main highway to be ferried somewhere safer. Drawing on a cigarette, the 30-something driver called Vladimir said they were not his relatives. He was just helping them escape. ""It's hell down there,"" he said, before jumping into his car to return.","It seems like eastern Ukraine is half-way through a game of chess, writes CNN's Tim Lister .

"(CNN) -- Hours before 22 U.S. embassies and consulates were to close for a day, President Barack Obama met with top security leaders Saturday to review the situation that led to the unprecedented move. A U.S. global travel alert remained in place amid fears that al Qaeda may launch attacks in the Middle East, North Africa and beyond in coming weeks. The threat prompted the United States to announce that 22 facilities would be closed on Sunday, including in Yemen, which was a focus of concern. Obama met Saturday with his White House chief of staff, Secretary of State John Kerry, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, as well as the heads of Homeland Security, the National Security Agency, the FBI and CIA, the United Nations and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. On Saturday, the security around the U.S. embassy in Yemen was even tighter than last year when the embassy was raided by protesters. At least 12 tanks were stationed within 500 meters of the building. Hundreds of additional security forces were deployed, and roads leading to the embassy were closed. Checkpoints were set up at a distance from the embassy, and trucks weren't allowed to pass anywhere near the main embassy road. Yemen's special forces, the most elite, were seen in small numbers near the embassy, as well. Meanwhile, Britain, France and Germany have said they, too, will close their embassies in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, on Sunday and Monday for security reasons. No other embassies are affected, they said. Neither Italy nor Spain -- which has no embassy in Yemen -- planned to close any of their embassies. The U.S. embassies closed on Sunday -- a day they would normally be open -- stretch across a swath of North Africa and the Middle East, from Mauritania to Oman. Bangladesh and Afghanistan, both majority Muslim nations, also are affected. The U.S. government's actions are in response to growing intelligence that shows a potential for attacks in Yemen and elsewhere in the Middle East and North Africa, said U.S. officials who spoke to CNN on condition of not being identified. Official: Security tightened in Yemen . ""The threat appears to be much worse than it has (been) in a long time,"" said a senior national security official in Yemen, where the government is ""on high alert against possible attacks in the days to come."" Various Western targets -- not just those tied to the United States -- are under threat, two U.S. officials said. Three sources said the United States has information that members of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula are in the final stages of planning for an unspecified attack. One of the sources said such preparations appeared to have increased in recent days with the approaching end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Sunday is Laylet al-Qadr, or the Night of Power, one of the holiest moments on the Muslim calendar. Said one U.S. official: ""It all leads us to believe something could happen in the near future."" What's behind timing of terror threat . Christopher Hill, a former U.S. ambassador to Iraq, told CNN he had never seen embassy closures ordered across such a broad area. ""There have been incidents where they've closed down a number of embassies in the Middle East because the information is not specific enough to say that 'embassy X' got to be closed as opposed to other embassies,"" said Hill, who joined the U.S. Foreign Service in 1977. ""But I think this, closing all of these embassies in the Middle East to North Africa, is in fact unprecedented. At least, I didn't see this during my career."" 'Leave Yemen now' U.S. officials said that, based on intelligence, they were particularly concerned about the U.S. Embassy in Yemen between Saturday and Tuesday. President Barack Obama, amid regular updates on the situation, has directed officials to take all appropriate steps to protect Americans. A White House official said the president was updated Saturday morning by Lisa Monaco, his assistant for homeland security and counterterrorism. Obama, who departed for Joint Base Andrews to play golf, is being updated through the weekend, the official said. He praised Yemeni President Abdo Rabu Mansour Hadi for his country's efforts following a meeting Thursday at the White House. The UK Foreign Office has also warned its citizens against travel to Yemen, and urged British nationals to leave as soon as possible. ""If you don't leave the country now while commercial carriers are still flying it is extremely unlikely that the British government will be able to evacuate you or provide consular assistance,"" it said. Photos: Attacks on U.S. diplomatic sites . It was unclear whether the apparent plot targets that Arabian nation or one elsewhere -- which is why the travel alert applies so broadly, and why embassies from Bangladesh to Libya are being closed. Nor is the expected time of an attack known, which explains why the U.S. travel alert extends through August. ""Terrorists may elect to use a variety of means and weapons and target both official and private interests,"" the alert states. ""U.S. citizens are reminded of the potential for terrorists to attack public transportation systems and other tourist infrastructure."" New York Rep. Peter King, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, called the information ""the most specific I've seen."" While the principal attention is on the Arabian Peninsula, he stressed to CNN's Wolf Blitzer that ""we can't rule anything out."" ""We are focused on the Middle East, but it's a potential series of attacks that really could be almost anyplace,"" King said. 22 embassies, consulates ordered closed . The State Department listed the 22 embassies and consulates that are closed Sunday, which is normally the start of the work week in the countries affected. The 17 affected U.S. embassies are in Afghanistan, Algeria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Djibouti, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, Mauritania, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Sudan and Yemen. The U.S. Embassy in Israel will be closed as normal Sunday. See the whole list . Consulates in Iraq, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are also being shut for the day. Embassies and consulates in the region typically close or operate with minimal staff on Fridays and Saturdays. The shutdowns could extend beyond Sunday, a senior State Department official said. Retired Gen. James Mattis -- who until earlier this year was head of U.S. Central Command, responsible for a 20-country area that includes the Middle East -- said the decision to close the embassies underscores the reality of the threat and the wisdom of U.S. policymakers. U.S. embassies have been targeted before in places such as Yemen, Turkey and Tanzania, he pointed out. Moreover, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is one of the terrorist network's most active and most destructive branches. ""We have to remember that we're up against an enemy who kills indiscriminately -- whether it be women, children, diplomats -- and our embassies ... have been one of the targets,"" Mattis told CNN on Friday. Referring to the move by U.S. officials, he said, ""They are showing some proactive discretion here, making certain that we don't give the enemy an opportunity that we can deny them."" Meanwhile, Canada shuttered for one day its diplomatic mission in Bangladesh on Saturday. Questions, concerns after Benghazi . House leaders have been briefed, Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi told reporters, adding that the travel alert and embassy closings provided ""some understanding of the seriousness of the threat."" King, who has also heard such briefings, applauded the government's decision to close its diplomatic missions. ""I give them credit,"" the Republican said of the Obama administration. ""I think the government is doing exactly the right thing here."" Such bipartisan agreement in Washington comes at a time when politicians are still scrutinizing the September 11, 2012, attack on the U.S. consular compound in Benghazi, Libya, which killed four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens. Since then, Republicans have been pressing Obama's administration for answers, with some accusing officials of covering up what happened in Benghazi and not doing enough to track down the attackers. Eight GOP lawmakers are asking that incoming FBI Director James Comey brief Congress within 30 days about the investigation. They say the administration's inquiry to date has been ""simply unacceptable,"" according to a draft letter obtained by CNN. Earlier this week, Vice President Joe Biden and senior State Department officials went to Congress to discuss embassy security. Biden also briefed congressional leadership, key committee chairmen and ranking members about the latest threat concerns, a source who attended the meeting said. Another official said the recent intelligence might not have warranted such a response before the Benghazi attack, which created a political firestorm for the administration. On Thursday, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said the agency was taking the steps out of an abundance of caution. CNN found embassy attack suspect before FBI .

"(CNN) -- The suspect charged with murder in last week's shooting that left one person dead and two wounded at Seattle Pacific University wrote a journal entry on the morning of the shooting stating ""I just want people to die, and I'm going to die with them,"" prosecutors said. In the weeks before the shooting, Aaron Ybarra, 26, kept a journal in which he allegedly expressed ""admiration for the perpetrators of other incidents of mass violence -- at Columbine High School and at Virginia Tech University,"" King County Prosecuting Attorney Dan Satterberg said. Satterberg said the entries also indicate Ybarra had considered shooting people at other campuses in Washington state but chose SPU shortly before the incident. He wasn't a student at the school. Ybarra is charged with one count of murder in the first degree and two counts of attempted murder in the first degree, prosecutors announced Tuesday. Prosecutors will seek a special sentence of life in prison, Satterberg said. Ybarra typically would face 69 to 86 years in prison if convicted of the charges, but prosecutors will argue that an aggravating factor -- a ""destructive and foreseeable impact on persons beyond the victims"" -- allows for a life sentence. Ybarra is scheduled to be arraigned June 23, Satterberg said. Counselors and friendly friends even showed Ybarra around the campus in the days before the shooting, and he allegedly carried out the minute-long shooting just before the academic year ended, Satterberg said. Ybarra allegedly kept the journal in anticipation that he would die in the attack, the prosecutor said. Ybarra allegedly went to the campus armed with a 12-caliber double-barrel shotgun with 50 rounds in his pockets. But the gun malfunctioned, rendering the double-barrel shotgun into a single-barrel one, the prosecutor said. Ybarra allegedly fired only two shots -- killing one student and wounding two others -- before student security guard Jon Meis pepper-sprayed Ybarra's eyes and took away the shotgun, Satterberg said. Meis put the shotgun in his office and returned to take a large hunting knife away from Ybarra, Satterberg alleged. Another student assisted in allegedly disarming Ybarra, kicking the knife out of reach, Satterberg said. ""Jon Meis is an authentic hero,"" Satterberg said. ""He saved many more lives."" During the shooting, one student was wearing headphones and was oblivious to the noise and the fact that a shotgun was pointed at him, Satterberg said. The gunman decided not to shoot the students, Satterberg said. ""Just as suddenly as this crime erupted, it was over,"" Satterberg said. ""The whole thing took less than a minute."" Ybarra is accused of fatally shooting Paul Lee, a 19-year-old student, in the back of the head, Satterberg said. One of the wounded, a 19-year-old woman, underwent surgery after the shooting, Susan Gregg of Harborview Medical Center said. A second victim, a 24-year-old man, was discharged Friday, she said. The shooting at the university on Thursday afternoon began when a man armed with a shotgun opened fire outside and inside Otto Harris Hall, which houses the engineering, math and science departments. Ybarra has a history of mental health problems and was on suicide watch last week at the jail, public defender Ramona Brandes said. Ybarra has ""significant and long-standing mental health issues, including delusions that were in play"" at the time of the shooting, she told reporters last week. ""...He's on suicide watch for a reason. He did not think he was going to survive yesterday. He intended to die."" Brandes said Ybarra was aware of what happened. ""He is cognizant of the suffering of the victims and their families and the entire Seattle Pacific community,"" she said. ""He is sorry."" Ybarra had had several run-ins with police in recent years. He was taken into custody in 2010 and 2012 for a mental health hold, Mountlake Terrace Assistant Police Chief Pete Caw told CNN. In both cases, authorities determined Ybarra was intoxicated, incoherent and suicidal, Caw said. The image of the suspect as a gun-toting killer is a difficult one to reconcile for those who know him. One friend described Ybarra as ""socially awkward"" but ""appreciative,"" according to KOMO. ""I have no idea what set him off,"" said Nate Flesch. ""That's why this whole thing kind of surprises me -- that he was trying to turn his life around, that he was trying to be a better person, and he was kind of working on his social skills, too."" CNN's Chelsea J. Carter, Greg Morrison, AnneClaire Stapleton, Suzanne Presto and Ben Brumfield contributed to this report.","NEW: Ybarra's double-barrel shotgun malfunctioned, prosecutor alleges .

"(CNN) -- Harry Devert left a job as a trader in finance to take a transcontinental motorcycle journey from the United States to Latin America. Six months ago, he vanished after sending his girlfriend in New York an ominous text message from a troubled region in Mexico, about being escorted from ""an area too dangerous for me to be."" Mexican authorities, acting on tips, on Thursday located his green Kawasaki motorcycle in a shallow grave in the state of Guerrero, along with the badly decomposed remains of a man in two plastic bags, said Darren Del Sardo, an attorney for Devert's mother. The identity of the body has not been confirmed, said a statement from the Guerrero office of public safety. The discovery was made nearly 300 miles southwest of where Devert was last heard from in January. ""We don't know whether it's Harry or not,"" Del Sardo said. On Saturday, Devert's mother Ann was to fly to Mexico after identifying the VIN number on the motorcycle found in Mexico. A day earlier she provided a DNA sample to police in New York to match against the remains. ""She's just remaining hopeful as any mother would,"" Del Sardo said. ""One way or another, she's hoping for either closure or hoping that she's at least one step closer to finding him due to the fact the motorcycle was found."" Del Sardo said Ann Devert spent time in Mexico after her son's disappearance, meeting local authorities and residents in the southwestern Mexican state of Michoacan in an attempt to find him. There was hope with unconfirmed tips that he was being held at a ranch. This week, she was notified of the remains and the bike in the shallow grave. Mexican authorities said the motorcycle was found along a road leading to La Majahua beach in Guerrero. The statement said ""10 packages of what appeared to be narcotics (marijuana and cocaine)"" were found near the motorbike and body. Del Sardo said Ann Devert was told that the remains may have been moved to the shallow grave. Devert's mother hopes to examine the remains for any signs that they are her son's, Del Sardo said. ""She's keeping her spirits up at this point and, most importantly, hoping that she gets confirmation one way or another as soon as possible,"" he said. Devert, 32, had not been in touch with his mother or girlfriend in New York since January 25. That day he sent girlfriend Sarah Ashley Schiear an ominous text via the WhatsApp messenger app. ""Just got an hour and a half long escort out of some area it was too dangerous for me to be,"" the message said. ""Stopping for lunch and ... voila Internet. ... Gonna get back on the road soon. Apparently there's another military escort waiting for me in some other town... I'm running way late because of the crazy military stuff...hopefully get a chance to talk to you tonight when I (hopefully) finally arrive."" He had checked out of a bed and breakfast in Michoacan and planned to travel to a beach in Zihuatanejo, on the Pacific Ocean, that was in the final scene of the film ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" according to friends and family. Ann Devert last heard from her son January 23. The phone connection was poor. He told her he'd be out of cell phone and Internet range for a few days. She told CNN earlier this year that he would call every January 29, his late father's birthday, ""and when he didn't, I felt a misgiving but I thought maybe it would take a couple of days,"" she said. ""He didn't call."" Then, Ann Devert heard from a friend who recently returned from Michoacan, where vigilante self-defense groups in numerous communities have engaged in deadly confrontations with the Knights Templar drug cartel. After vigilantes threatened to descend on a key cartel area last month, the Mexican government sent in thousands of troops and police to try to keep the peace. The government has even joined forces with the vigilantes as the Knights Templar become further entrenched in the agricultural state. Ann Devert had been in touch with both the American and French embassies in Mexico. Her son, born in France, has dual citizenship. Devert's friends and family were hopeful that his disappearance was only temporary, another story to recount from his wild travels around the world -- from Pamplona, Spain, to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and beyond. ""I've been chased with a gun in Colombia, chipped my tooth on a gun that was shoved in my mouth in Venezuela and shot everything from a bazooka to a machine gun, an M16 to a Colt .45,"" Devert wrote in his travel blog, A New Yorker Travels. ""I've been in some of the poorest and some of the most dangerous parts of the world and to many of the finest, and I still can't tell which I liked more. I think that life is a pilgrimage."" In an October 19 post, Devert described his latest journey on a type of vehicle he had no experience using. ""I've never ridden a motorcycle,"" he wrote. ""Mostly, naturally, because I don't know how. So tomorrow I'm going to go to the DMV, get my motorcycle permit, buy a bike and hopefully figure out how to ride it home without crashing. Which I'm sure will be an adventure in itself."" He added, ""Then in the next 2 or 3 weeks I'm going to drive it across America, through Central America, down to Brazil for the World Cup, and eventually south to Ushuaia, which as far as I can tell from a map is about as far south as one can get on the continent."" He purchased a green 2002 Kawasaki. Ann Devert said her son took a safety course and spent hours studying YouTube videos on how to survive falls from bikes. But the fact that he had never driven a motorcycle concerned her, she said. He promised not to travel faster than 55 mph, yet he took a nasty spill while speeding in Florida, Ann Devert said. He emerged unscathed. Friends and family created the Help Find Harry page in Facebook, with more than 25,000 likes. Remains found in desert are California couple missing since 2010 .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- The Libyan war may be over, but rivalries rage on among some regional militias, leading to a mutual distrust that poses a challenge to the new leadership. Earlier this week, the rivalry was evident when dozens of fighters clashed at a Tripoli hospital in what residents said was the biggest armed confrontation in the capital in weeks. Clashes erupted at 2 a.m. Monday when a half dozen former rebels from Zintan city in the western mountains stormed the hospital, according to doctors. Some of the former rebels were drunk, and demanded staff hand over a wounded fighter shot earlier that day, according to the doctors, who spoke on condition of anonymity for safety reasons. The patient and the body of a dead fighter had been taken to the hospital earlier, the doctors said, and the former rebels wanted to kill the wounded man. Hospital staff declined to hand over the patient, who was undergoing surgery. Tripoli fighters in charge of hospital security forced them out , but not before the returning fighters shot rounds in the hospital. Both groups called for backup, which arrived as fighting raged around the hospital grounds until 5 a.m. Witnesses said both sides were using heavy machine guns and anti-aircraft guns. Walls near a hospital entrance were riddled with bullets holes, and nearby glass doors and windows were shattered. Across the street, bullets pierced through the walls of two buildings. There were no deaths from gunshots, but medical staff said three patients died of stress-related causes that they linked to the fighting. At least three of the Tripoli fighters were wounded in the clashes, according to Salem Abaza, who is in charge of hospital security. He described it as the most serious incident of infighting so far. Accounts differed over how the three-hour battle concluded, but at least three witnesses said it ended after calls from a local imam and senior commanders from both groups talked by phone with their men. Tripoli fighters said Tuesday they are concerned about the rising tensions among the various groups, which are increasingly divided along regional allegiances. ""We are concerned, as you can see, every day there is fighting between the rebels, this is something we don't want, we want a united Libya,"" said fighter Tammam Basheer. The scene on Tripoli's streets these days -- heavily armed men brandishing guns and racing across the city with no central command and little or no accountability -- has raised concerns among residents. ""There are no security forces, everyone is running their own group, their own brigade, and they all control Tripoli,"" said Tripoli militia member Taha, who did not provide a second name. Disarming tens of thousands of fighters who brought down ruler Moammar Gadhafi and bringing them under control is a top challenge for the fledgling interim government. Acting Prime Minister Abdurrahim El-Keib is expected to present his Cabinet within two weeks. Military officials downplayed the tensions among the various militias, and say their biggest challenge is rebuilding the military. ""We would like to reorganize our army again,"" said Col. Ahmed Bani, the National Transitional Council's military spokesman. ""When we have a great and strong army, we are safe. We will save our dreams, we will save our democracy, our borders."" At the Tripoli hospital, staff spoke of other recent incidents of intimidation by armed militiamen and called on authorities to provide protection and pull the weapons off the streets. ""We are really afraid, we do not want stethoscopes to be fighting guns,"" Dr. Ali Osman said.","Dozens of fighters clash at a Tripoli hospital this week .

"(CNN) -- When the last surviving soldiers of the First World War -- British Tommies and French poilus alike -- died a few years ago, national newspapers in London and Paris, but also in Canberra, Wellington and Ottawa, responded to this transition with numerous articles. The reason was obvious: For the French as for the British, the former Dominions, but also for the Belgians, World War I is seen still today as the main historical watershed of the 20th century. And it is not by accident that in the political and historical language of these countries this fact is reflected accordingly. The war is not so much commemorated as the first of two world wars but as La Grande Guerre, The Great War, De Groote Oorlog. Commemorating the war in Germany has always been and still today is much more complicated. Whatever were the consequences of the war after 1918, there was another history that came to overshadow the war and made it only the first of two catastrophes. In the light of National Socialist dictatorship, the Second World War and the monstrosity of the Holocaust, the war of 1914 became, in the eyes of many Germans, a kind of past past, a prelude to the total war which started in September 1939 and which would lead to the final catastrophe of a German nation state in the 20th Century. It is against this background that even after 100 years, for many Germans the fatal shots in Sarajevo mark the beginning of a second Thirty Years War of unprecedented violence between 1914 and 1945 -- in other words there is a stark tendency to view the First World War in relation to 1933 and 1939, and to see the rise of Hitler as a consequence of the burden which the war and the following peace treaty of Versailles brought about. The prize of this retrospective logic is a very deterministic view on history: As if the Weimar Republic had been doomed to failure from its very beginning, and as if there had never been any alternative to dictatorship, mass murder and total war. This constellation also explains why in German discussions, the dimension of the war is reduced to the question of a specific war guilt. Since one cannot possibly deny the responsibility for the outbreak of war in 1939, the debate on 1914 is all the more intensive -- even 50 years after the so-called Fischer debate of the 1960s, caused by the Hamburg historian Fritz Fischer who argued that German political and military elites deliberately caused the war in an attempt to break off the perceived encirclement of the country. In a fierce controversy, Fischer was attacked by many conservative colleagues, many of whom had fought in the war. They accused him of confirming, ex-post facto, the allied position after 1918 vis-à-vis Germany and of legitimizing the Versailles treaty's logic, which had so much poisoned the Weimar Republic's political culture. The amazing success of Christopher Clark's book ""The Sleepwalkers"" in Germany a hundred years after the outbreak of the war underlines just how important the question of war guilt still is in the eyes of many Germans. The book's argument of shared responsibility, of all international actors and a complex interaction in July 1914, is translated into some kind of historical exculpation: Yes, Germany caused the Second World War, but it is not the main and sole culprit behind the escalation in 1914 -- and hence German responsibility for what went wrong in the first half of the 20th Century seems to be put in relative terms. At the moment one can witness how historical analysis is translated into the politics of history. At first sight this is the core of what seems to be the continuation of earlier debates of the 1960s between followers and critics of Fischer. But behind this, another debate becomes visible: One about Germany's self-positioning in Europe and the world. Because for decades the experience of two world wars and the catastrophe of the German nation state meant that Germany would abstain from a leading political role, including military engagements, corresponding to the country's economic strength. Against this background it is hardly surprising that some political commentators argue that now, with the war-guilt of 1914 put away, it is high time to re-formulate a more outspoken European and world-wide responsibility of German politics. However it seems surprising that all of this is still a very German perspective on a world war that was so much more than what happened at the Western and the Eastern front. From a German perspective it is all too easy to fall into the retrospective logic of history, to view 1914 in the light of 1933, 1939 and 1945. But the first of two world wars was more than a prelude, and it was more than an explosion of violence in Europe. When writing my own book on the First World War in Harvard, many colleagues from the Americas, from Africa, from China, Japan and from India were right in asking for a global view on a truly global war. Compared with this perspective the German view on the First World War is still heavily impregnated by the boundaries of national memory. READ MORE: Should nations pay price for leaders' misdeeds?

"(CNN) -- I peered over the shoulder of the flight engineer and studied the pressurization gauge on his panel. The needle indicated that the cabin was climbing, and the slow popping in my ears confirmed it. Not good. The flight engineer swiveled his seat away from the panel and turned in my direction, brow furrowed, eyes wide. ""Should I tell the captain?"" he asked. The question seemed foolish, but I understood. The flight engineer was brand new, having completed his training with the airline a week earlier. I was a seasoned veteran of six months, observing from the jump seat for the purpose of monitoring co-pilot procedures. I had just upgraded from the flight engineer position to a ""window seat"" on the 727. ""Yes,"" I replied with raised eyebrows. ""I would tell the captain...like right now."" The captain had already begun to swivel in his seat. He squinted at the array of switches and indications on the panel. A conference with the flight engineer ensued. All four of us in the cockpit focused momentarily on the cabin rate needle. It was still indicating a climb. For some mysterious reason, we were slowly losing cabin pressurization. The captain turned toward me in a silent gesture to obtain confirmation. I nodded. Without hesitation, he instructed the co-pilot to request an immediate descent to 10,000 feet from our altitude of 37,000 feet. I reached for the oxygen mask and strapped it to my face. The rest of the crew followed my lead. Ten minutes later, and after the completion of the appropriate emergency checklist, we reached 10,000 feet. Our 152 passengers had to endure a lack of air conditioning because of the pressurization problem, but other than that, the experience was a non-event. This should have been the same outcome for the single-engine Socata TBM 900 turboprop that crashed, tragically, in the waters off Jamaica on Friday. The TBM 900 had departed Rochester, New York, bound for Naples, Florida, with two occupants on board: Larry Glazer, the pilot/owner and his wife, Jane Glazer. But the pilot became unresponsive while the airplane cruised at 25,000 feet over Georgia. Instead of landing in Naples, the autopilot system allowed the turboprop to continue flying off the eastern U.S. coastline, crossing over Cuba before, with its fuel supply exhausted, it crashed into the sea about 12 miles north of the Jamaican coastline. Two U.S.-launched F-15s confirmed through observation that the pilot appeared unconscious. The French-made TBM 900 is a sophisticated piece of technology, far superior to the old Boeing 727 airliner I described above. It is a great representative of the new generation in privately-owned cabin class airplanes, competing with traditional twin-engine turboprops and even small, corporate jets. Composite material, finely tuned aeroengineering design, a reliable and proven Pratt and Whitney engine and advanced cockpit displays and controls all combine to make the $3.7 million airplane a respected machine. More than 1,000 of these airplanes are operating today; the 900 is the most recent version. According to an Aircraft Owners and Pilot Association (AOPA) report, this was the third TBM owned by Larry Glazer; he had logged 5,000 hours in the model. One would think that such experience would have produced a positive result and not a crash into the ocean. What happened exactly? Hypoxia, lack of oxygen to the brain, would appear to be the most likely culprit. Depending upon the health condition of an individual, the time of useful consciousness at 25,000 feet isn't much more than about a minute. But that's if a depressurization occurs as a catastrophic event with some type of major hole in the fuselage, allowing air to escape explosively. But in this instance, judging by 30 minutes of Air Traffic Control audio recording, it was not a catastrophic occurrence, but rather a slow event. News reports say the pilot asked to descend to 18,000 feet because ""we have an indication that is not correct in the plane,"" according to a stream of that transmission posted on LiveATC.net. After about one minute, the airplane was cleared initially from 28,000 feet to 25,000 feet where it eventually remained until fuel exhaustion. While descending, ATC gave further clearance to 20,000 feet but the pilot responded with an unintelligible transmission. It's possible he was already suffering from hypoxia. A slow loss of oxygen to the brain is insidious; most people not familiar with the symptoms don't recognize the danger. A depressurization problem is a traumatic event that it is easily managed -- but only if the problem is recognized. Like the captain of the 727, a pilot facing such a situation would have to don an oxygen mask the minute he suspected the issue. The next objective would be to descend the airplane to a habitable altitude -- 10,000 feet is a typical procedure goal. For this to occur, a sense of urgency has to be stated or an emergency declared. Apparently, none of this happened. At the airline level, we train for such a depressurization event from day one. It is an emergency that is etched into our muscle memory. I am certain this emergency was part of the training for this particular TBM pilot. Whether it was part of his muscle memory, we can't know. The airplane is equipped with an emergency oxygen bottle attached to quick-donning masks for just such circumstances. It is possible that the system may have malfunctioned. Perhaps a closed valve not noticed on the preflight inspection? An undetected leak? Or maybe the system that had been causing the malfunction released the cabin pressurization in one final event. Regardless, if indeed a pressurization malfunction had been observed, the prudent decision would have been to descend immediately and head off a tragedy. Sad as this outcome was, we can be thankful for small favors.

"(CNN) -- Russian lawmakers backed a sweeping amnesty law Wednesday that could see jailed members of the Pussy Riot punk protest band released early and arrested Greenpeace activists avoiding prison, the state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported. The law received enough votes in favor in the Duma that it does not require President Vladimir Putin's signature, Ria Novosti said. The amnesty, to mark the anniversary of the adoption of Russia's post-Communist constitution in 1993, will be applied to thousands of Russian prisoners, the agency reported. It is due to take effect on Thursday, according to the Russian government daily newspaper, Rossiyskaya Gazeta. Pussy Riot's Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Maria Alyokhina are serving two-year jail terms for their part in a performance critical of Putin, when he was Prime Minister. The performance was held at a Russian Orthodox cathedral in 2012, and the musicians were found guilty of hooliganism. The women, set to complete their sentences in coming months, have young children and would therefore qualify for the amnesty, RIA Novosti said. In September, 30 people were arrested after a Greenpeace protest at an offshore oil platform in the Arctic and charged with hooliganism. They were told they would face trial. ""With the amnesty also extended to individuals on trial, however, the group may be free from prosecution and its foreign members be allowed to return home,"" RIA Novosti said. Russia's record on human rights is in the spotlight as the country prepares to host the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi in February.

"Washington (CNN) -- The latest video ad from the Republican Senate campaign arm accuses Michelle Nunn, the Democratic Senate candidate in Georgia, of supporting amnesty. Seems like the usual in hyper-partisan Washington, right? But in attacking the Democratic candidate, the ad also lumps in more than a dozen Republicans, including a rising GOP star who might run for president in 2016. ""Michelle Nunn proudly supports Obama's amnesty plan for illegal immigrants"" flashes across the screen during the 30-second spot. But the ad cites a Politico story in which Nunn expressed her support for a Senate immigration bill that passed with the support of 14 Republicans, who were led by Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, who is widely viewed as a potential 2016 presidential candidate. It wouldn't be the first time conservatives have painted Rubio's support for immigration reform as pro-amnesty, but the National Republican Senatorial Committee ad is an attack on Republican supporters of immigration reform from the establishment. So, the GOP ad raises the question, does Marco Rubio also ""proudly [support] Obama's amnesty plan for illegal immigrants""? First Lady hits campaign trail for Nunn .","GOP ad: ""Michelle Nunn proudly supports Obama's amnesty plan for illegal immigrants""

"(CNN) -- In American business great CEOs embody their companies. They persuasively connect their companies' brands to the emotions, desires, aspirations and, yes, the fears and challenges of consumers -- men and women alike. Jack Welch of General Electric, Roger Enrico of PepsiCo, Howard Schultz of Starbucks, Steve Jobs of Apple all come to mind. A great CEO is a company's No. 1 salesperson. Yet Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has showed himself as just the opposite, last week whipping up the justified anger of women in the workforce with advice that they should wait patiently for pay raises. At Thursday's global conference of women in tech, dedicated to the memory of a legendary female computer scientist, Grace Hopper, Nadella -- the first ever male keynote speaker -- was responding to a query on advice for women who are uncomfortable asking for raises and promotions. He told conferees: ""It's not really about asking for the raise, but knowing and having faith that the system will actually give you the right raises as you go along."" He later added that such restraint is ""good karma. It'll come back because somebody's going to know that's the kind of person that I want to trust."" How could Nadella be so -- putting it charitably -- tone-deaf? At the very least, he was unprepared: A great CEO is always ready to be put on the spot, to answer questions on a tough subject from his corporate vantage point as a powerful leader. The big stunner for the headlines, however, was that Nadella revealed a remarkable level of insensitivity and ignorance about the huge barriers women face in the workplace. The immediate backlash showed just how out of step he is with the reality faced by a substantial chunk of his workforce talent every day as it tries to advance up the ladder of success at Microsoft. For women, his comments are a reality check -- a clear sign that even though the general consciousness about women, work and equality is higher than ever, so much remains to be done. More than ever, women need to stand up, be heard and challenge the prevailing attitudes that maintain unequal treatment. Nadella's company, for example, recently reported dismal statistics on the number of women in its management ranks. Microsoft revealed that while women make up 29% of its total workforce, they are 17% of its leadership -- the lowest among their tech peers, though by a slim margin of 4 percentage points. The ""system"" Nadella wants women to depend upon at Microsoft has not been kind. Bethany McLean writes in the November issue of Vanity Fair magazine that it has rested on a leadership culture embodied by Nadella's predecessor, Steve Ballmer, that drove, according to one person interviewed for the article, ""sub-optimal human behavior,"" as well as behavior modeled by both Ballmer and Microsoft founder Bill Gates that had, according to a former executive quoted, ""too often crossed the line into abuse."" It's not just Microsoft. At Harvard, women faculty disagreed with their male peers by a ratio of 2-to-1 ""that the climate for female faculty in the School/Department is at least as good as for male faculty."" Just as meaningful as climate is access to powerful peers who decide whether nontenured faculty stay or go. The women faculty members said they felt excluded from an informal network that might improve the perception of their research or help them move up the ladder. Nadella's remarks are also a call for women to be not just impatient about raises but proactive about compensation equality. Money and representation equal power and mobility, especially among male-dominated groups. According to an article in the Financial Times, ""women engineers make 89 cents for every dollar their male colleagues earn."" That reality is a result, in part, of the limited impact a minority group can have on a system when they are underrepresented in the power structure: Five out of every six tech employees at Microsoft, Google and Facebook are male, the article says, quoting data from Harvard economist Claudia Goldin. Nadella hit a nerve because his offhanded remark revealed a truth, and women need to be vocal storytellers about how attitudes such as his can hold them back. They need to take action to support, encourage and network on these issues inside these corporate systems. After all, it is persistent challenges against defenses that ultimately change an organism. Our experience working with women in companies in media, communications and consumer products suggest that they are coming together -- and with the support of male peers -- to share wisdom and raise awareness on issues of professional ethics and equality, including harassment, unequal compensation and negative stereotyping. In the entrepreneurial realm, nonprofit groups such as Springboard Enterprises and FITE give women-led startups access to venture capital, and raise awareness, through public relations, of the disproportionately low startup funding available to women entrepreneurs. As a society, we've been at this now for years but, arguably, there's never been a better, more opportune, time in history for women to be proactive and persuasive about changes that have to come about for everyone. Male-dominated companies such as Microsoft stand to gain a lot by being proactive about equality: They can reduce expenses by limiting turnover, maximize the value of the investment in educating women and improve overall productivity and competitiveness. As they work toward this, one immediate change Microsoft might want to consider: Hire an executive coach.","Writers: Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said women should wait for karma to get ahead .

"Washington (CNN) -- South Carolina officials head to federal court on Monday to defend a controversial new voter identification law, dismissing suggestions the requirement would deny tens of thousands of people, many of them minorities, access to the ballot. A weeklong trial will kick off in Washington before a panel of three judges who will decide whether the law should take effect. It is one of several legal challenges to voter identification laws nationwide. A key enforcement provision of the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965, gives the federal government open-ended oversight of states and communities with a history of voter discrimination. Any changes in voting laws and procedures in those areas must be ""pre-cleared"" with Washington. South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson has defended the law, saying it will not harm any potential voter. ""The changes have neither the purpose nor will they have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race, color, or membership in a language minority,"" Wilson said. The Justice Department blocked the measure from taking effect last year, concluding it was discriminatory. Federal officials cited figures that registered minority voters were about 20 percent more likely than white voters to lack state-issued photo identification. The Justice Department estimated that more than 80,000 people in South Carolina could be adversely impacted by the planned requirements. Republican Gov. Nikki Haley has called the Justice Department's decision ""outrageous"" and ordered a lawsuit. State officials have deflected criticism the legal battle could end up costing taxpayers $1 million or more. ""It wouldn't cost anything if (U.S. Attorney General) Eric Holder and the Department of Justice would get out of the way and let us protect our citizens and enforce our laws,"" Rob Godfrey, a spokesman for Haley, said earlier this year. A decision in the case could take weeks. In legal filings with the court, South Carolina officials said a law dating to 1988 requires a state-issued voter registration card and the voter's signature at the polls. The amended law approved last year would permit five types of photo identification: a state-issued driver's license, a non-driver identification card issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles, military identification, a U.S. passport, or state voter registration card. Waivers are allowed, but the voter must sign an affidavit specifying why she or he has a ""reasonable impediment"" to getting the necessary identification or has a religious objection to being photographed. If the law takes effect, South Carolina would be among 11 states that require official photo identification at the polls, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Proponents say the drive is an effort to stop what officials contend is voter fraud and to purge voter rolls of outdated information. Supporters say having valid, government-issued photo identification is a reasonable, modern-day necessity. Opponents assert that the effort disenfranchise poor, minority and disabled voters. Obama administration officials have concluded there is little evidence of voter fraud in the state warranting the legislative changes. A coalition of civil rights groups is expected to testify at next week's hearing, offering testimony from college students and elderly residents. Those groups say claims of voter fraud are exaggerated. ""South Carolina's photo ID measure is a solution in search of a problem. Credible studies show that one is more likely to be struck by lightning than to perceive an instance of in-person voter fraud,"" Ryan Haygood, a top lawyer at the NAACP's Legal Defense Fund, said. ""The [upcoming] trial will make clear that the state's proposed photo identification measure will have a significant impact on its minority voters."" The NAACP says that a quarter of African-Americans and 16 percent of Latinos nationally lack any kind of government-issued photo identification. A separate federal panel is considering similar challenge to a voter identification law in Texas. A federal trial was held last month and a ruling is expected soon. Both South Carolina and Texas say they will put their laws in place in time for the November elections, if they are upheld. It is possible the losing sides could ask the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene, delaying any immediate implementation. Other Republican-controlled states with similar laws under legal challenge include Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Mississippi, and Tennessee. The Justice Department this week gave approval to Virginia's less restrictive voter identification measure. North Carolina Gov. Beverly Perdue vetoed a law passed by the GOP-led General Assembly. The Supreme Court in 2008 allowed Indiana's voter identification law to stand in 2008, saying the stated goal of stopping voter fraud was a legitimate exercise of legislative power.","Panel of federal judges will decide whether voter identification law should take effect .

"(CNN) -- At least 17 people have died and dozens more were rescued after their boat capsized off the Turks and Caicos Islands in the Caribbean on Wednesday, according to the local government and U.S. officials. The U.S. Coast Guard, assisting the islands' rescue crews, retrieved about 55 Haitians in waters 100 meters from shore, the U.S. agency said. They fell into the water when their overloaded sail freighter tipped over, the guard said. The nationalities of the 17 dead people weren't immediately clear Wednesday, but 12 were males and five were female adults, said Colin Farquhar, commissioner of Royal Turks and Caicos Islands Police Force. Earlier reports had put the death toll at 18. Farquhar added that the search for additional casualties concluded late Wednesday because of darkness and worsening seas. The search will resume Thursday, he said. Although the Coast Guard put the number of rescued at near 55, local authorities used different numbers. A total of 33 people -- 21 men including a child and 12 females -- were detained as suspected illegal Haitian migrants and ""will be repatriated to Haiti at the earliest opportunity,"" Farquhar said. Officials couldn't be immediately reached for comment to explain the discrepancy between the approximate 55 rescues the Coast Guard cited and the 33 detainees Farquhar discussed. The Turks and Caicos Islands government said in a Facebook statement that a sailing vessel believed to be carrying suspected illegal migrants was intercepted by the Marine Branch of the islands' police force after 3 a.m. Wednesday. Two hours later, while the boat was being towed to a dock to unload the suspects, the sloop capsized, the statement said. ""The stricken vessel has now been removed from the water and will be central to our ongoing investigations into this matter,"" Farquhar said. ""We must all remain vigilant to combat illegal migration."" He thanked police officers and emergency personnel for working under what he called ""challenging circumstances."" Police were searching Wednesday ""for the handful of people who reached shore and fled the scene,"" the government said. The Turks and Caicos Islands are a British territory. The incident occurred near the country's island of Providenciales, commonly known as ""Provo"" and described on the official tourism website as its most developed isle where most international flights arrive. The 33 rescued people -- all Haitians -- were in custody of the government's immigration detention-removal center, Farquhar said. Authorities revised that figure from an earlier reported count of 32 rescued people. Haitian migrants seeking to enter the United States have used the Turks and Caicos Islands and the Bahamas as way stations to enter the United States. Migrants appear undeterred, even after deadly shipwrecks . CNN's Elwyn Lopez contributed to this report.","NEW: U.S. Coast Guard says it rescues about 55 Haitians .

"(CNN) -- Sandra Fisher heard the sound of running water in her Charleston, West Virginia, home on Monday for the first time in four days after a chemical leak fouled water supplies for hundreds of thousands of people. Fisher was one of the first 5,000 customers, many of them large commercial users, who were told they could start flushing out their pipes after thousands of gallons of 4-methylcyclohexane methanol poured out of from a storage facility on the nearby Elk River on Thursday. The licorice-scented chemical, typically used to clean coal, got into Charleston's water supply, resulting in 300,000 people being told not to drink, cook or wash with water from their own taps. ""I knew a licorice smell in the air was something that couldn't be good,"" Fisher told CNN. ""I didn't think it was candy."" The West Virginia American Water Co. said it had lifted the do-not-use order for 26,000 customers by the end of the day. Flushing the final traces of contaminants from home and business water pipes could take days, said Jeff McIntyre, the water company's president. And officials asked that water customers not rush to turn on their faucets until told to do so, for fear that demand could cause pressure in the lines to falter, introducing yet more problems. ""It's certainly going to go into tomorrow, and I'm not sure how much longer,"" Randy Huffman, the head of the state Department of Environmental Protection, told CNN's The Situation Room. See West Virginia American Water Co. status map . The state put water restrictions into effect Thursday after discovering that about 7,500 gallons of the chemical, known as MCHM, had leaked into the Elk River just above a drinking water plant. Authorities told residents in nine West Virginia counties to stop using their water for everything except flushing toilets, and to watch for symptoms of exposure such as skin irritation, nausea, vomiting or wheezing. The spill left Charleston residents scrambling for bottled water to wash their hands, brush their teeth and cook. Without safe water, schools and many businesses were forced to close. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the water company trucked in bottled water, and police, firefighters and National Guard troops helped distribute it around Charleston, where resident Jen Williamson reported that most stores had been restocked by Monday. ""Disposable plates and utensils, etc. are in short supply but some local churches are giving those away,"" Williamson wrote in an e-mail to CNN. ""We are definitely trying to prevent dirty dishes but they are stacking up quickly. The problem is that when they say the water is fine to drink, do we believe them?"" She's not alone in her doubts. ""I'm not going to drink it for a while,"" Charleston resident Kate Long said. And Fisher said, ""I will be concerned probably for the rest of the time that I live here."" But Jerry Dawson, who works in the first zone allowed to begin using water, said he's sure county, state and water company officials have done all they need to do to ensure water safety. ""I'm tickled to death to get my water back,"" he said Monday afternoon. By Monday morning, water tests showed that levels of the chemical detected at water intakes had declined to well under the 1 part per million safety standard for consumption. Finished water showed even less of the contaminant, but people would probably still smell the chemical in their water even after flushing, Huffman said. Some residents have complained of irritation of the skin, throat, chest and stomach, Dr. Rahul Gupta of the Kanawha-Charleston Health Department said over the weekend. As of Monday morning, hospitals had seen 231 people for complaints related to contaminated water, admitting 14 of them, said Karen Bowling, secretary of the state's Department of Health and Human Resources. But calls to poison control centers had been declining, she said. But the unknowns made residents anxious. ""They don't even know what the health risks are,"" Stacy Kirk of Culloden told CNN affiliate WSAZ. ""We had bathed, cooked and everything right before the news came on (with the water warning)."" More than 20 lawsuits had already been filed, and a Charleston judge ordered the company at the source of the leak, Freedom Industries, and West Virginia American to preserve all relevant documents and physical evidence Monday. Absorbent booms lowered into the Elk River to contain the spill are coming out clean of any contaminants and without any odor, suggesting that the material has stopped leaking into the river, said Mike Dorsey, chief of the Department of Environmental Protection's Homeland Security and Emergency Response group. He said the agency is sending pumping equipment to the site to help deal with heavy rain expected soon in a bid to prevent any contamination from escaping from the site in runoff. No problems have been detected with fish kills or other effects on wildlife, Huffman said. Dorsey said earlier that the chemical leaked through a 1-inch hole in the wall of a storage tank owned by Freedom Industries, which supplies products for the coal mining industry. It moved through the soil into the river. Officials don't know exactly when the leak began, but they don't think it was long before Thursday morning, when it was first reported. Freedom Industries President Gary Southern said two Freedom employees noticed material leaking from a storage tank into a dike about 10:30 a.m. Thursday. They contacted authorities and began the cleanup process, including hauling away the chemical still in the tank and vacuuming some from the nearby ground, he said. C.W. Sigman, deputy emergency manager for Kanawha County, said the tank appeared to be ""antique."" He told CNN on Saturday that the company ""didn't appear to understand the magnitude of the incident at the time."" ""I never got a good indication from the plant folks how bad the leak was, how much was going to the river, anything else. It was probably a little ways into the incident before we realized how bad it was getting into the river.""

"Washington (CNN) -- It's been true since the Wright Brothers first took flight: Bad plane accidents can lead to good safety improvements. A deadly fire on an Air Canada flight in 1983, for instance, led to lavatory smoke detectors. And the in-flight rupture of an Aloha Airlines fuselage five years later led to increased scrutiny of aging aircraft. But what will be the legacy of Asiana Airlines Flight 214, which crashed one year ago this weekend? CNN talked to safety experts and combed National Transportation Safety Board records for lessons learned in the Asiana crash. Man vs. Machine . In pilot lounges and aviation blogs, the verdict is in: Asiana's pilots screwed up. The crew over-relied on automation, unintentionally disabled the plane's auto-throttle, did not pay attention to the plane's slowing speed, and failed at basic piloting skills. That opinion is shared by the NTSB. Last month, the board concluded that the Asiana 214 crash resulted from the ""crew's mismanagement of the airplane's descent"" into San Francisco International Airport. It outlined a series of mistakes that led to the crash, which killed three teenage girls and seriously injured 49 of the 307 people aboard. In layman's language, Asiana 214 was caused by pilot error. But to blame the accident solely on pilot error is to miss the real lesson of Flight 214, past and present NTSB leaders say. The ""one change that I would like to see: Improving the human-machine interface,"" said former NTSB chairman Deborah A.P. Hersman, who oversaw the crash investigation. ""The Asiana crash involved an inherently safe aircraft that performed as designed and a very experienced crew,"" Hersman said. ""But it demonstrated that commercial pilots are trained to rely heavily on sophisticated automation, which can become a trap if they don't understand what the system is doing behind the control panel."" At a December hearing, the safety board heard evidence that the Asiana pilots were confused by autopilot modes, believing the auto-throttle would maintain the plane's speed. ""Automation has unquestionably made aviation safer and more efficient. But the more complex automation becomes, the more challenging it is to ensure that the pilots adequately understand it,"" current safety board acting chairman Christopher Hart said last month. ""In this instance, the flight crew over-relied on automated systems that they did not fully understand. As a result, they flew the aircraft too low and too slow and collided with the seawall at the end of the runway."" The NTSB ruled that ""complexities of the auto-throttle and autopilot"" systems contributed to the accident. It recommended that Boeing revise the B-777's operating manual to prevent confusion about the auto-pilot modes. Boeing says it's faultless . ""Boeing respectfully disagrees with the NTSB's statement that the 777's auto-flight system contributed to this accident,"" it said in a statement. ""The auto-flight system has been used successfully for over 200 million flight hours across several airplane models, and for more than 55 million safe landings,"" it said. ""All the airplane's systems performed as designed."" Boeing said it will review the NTSB's recommendations. MIT aeronautics Professor R. John Hansman Jr. said the most likely outcome of the Asiana 214 crash: ""an increased focus on pilot training to maintain basic piloting skills and not become too dependent on automation."" Emergency response . Experts say first responders performed heroically in racing to the damaged aircraft and removing trapped occupants. But about half of the NTSB's recommendations involve suggestions to improve emergency responses. Improvement is needed in coordination and communications, said Jeff Price, professor of aviation at aerospace at Metropolitan State University of Denver. ""I kind of relate it to putting a lot of all-stars on the field, but not have a common game plan."" During the Asiana 214 response, an incident commander placed an officer who had not received aircraft firefighting training in charge, the NTSB said. No injuries could be attributed to the officer, it noted. The airport fire department also had two vehicles equipped with turrets that could pierce a plane's fuselage. But while the Federal Aviation Administration had given guidance on how to pierce a fuselage, it had not given guidance on when to pierce a plane, the NTSB said. And two emergency medical buses failed to arrive at the scene, the NTSB said. The buses were not physically deployed during monthly drills, the board said, likely playing a role in the failure to use them during the crash. ""It's those types of things you need to exercise, so that when it's game time, you understand the realities of what you have to do,"" Price said. ""I think it's up to the FAA to raise the standards for airports,"" he said. The safety board said the airport initially deployed seven vehicles to the crash, exceeding the FAA-required minimum of three vehicles. And some 23 rescuers were initially deployed, though the FAA has no minimum staffing level. That means victims of crashes at smaller airports ""may not be afforded the same level of protection that the passengers of flight 214 had,"" the board said. What went right . Experts say the crash could have been much worse; passengers benefited from safety improvements. ""I've watched that (crash) video time and again,"" Price said. ""The structural integrity of that plane remained amazingly intact for what it went through. It was extraordinary. It protected the occupants very well."" ""If there's anything good to be had from all the accidents in the past and all the lives lost, it's made for amazing changes in the design of an aircraft,"" Price said. The main landing gear sheared away from the wings, by design. Passenger seats withstood the brutal g-forces. Luggage bins did not fall on the passengers or block their evacuation. The jet fuel did not erupt on impact. And when a fire finally broke out -- the result of leaking oil from the plane's right engine, which came to rest next to the fuselage -- it did not spread quickly. Fifteen minutes passed before black smoke was seen pouring from the plane's left door. Authorities note that 99% of the plane's occupants survived -- a rate that would have seemed impossible only a decade or two ago. Indeed, two of the three deaths may have been avoidable, the NTSB said. Two girls ejected from the plane had not buckled their seatbelts, investigators said, and likely would have survived if they had. A fire truck rolled over one of the ejected girls in the chaos of the crash scene. The third girl had on a seatbelt, but died at the hospital six days later of injuries suffered in the crash.

"(CNN) -- How does the wealthy boating enthusiast reconcile a passion for gas-guzzling superyachts with concern for the natural ocean environment? Sure, powerful engines and deluxe on-board facilities ensure the lap of high seas luxury, but these extravagant features are usually powered by high fuel emissions and energy consumption. But for the millionaire mariner with the planet's best interest at heart, help will soon be at hand in the shape of the Columbus Sport 130' Hybrid -- a new 40 meter ship that aims to fuse superyacht chic with an eco-friendly design concept. See also: The limousine-shaped superyacht . Currently on the production line of Italian ship builder, Palumbo Shipyards, the lavish vessel is due for completion in August 2013 and will cost a cool $30 million upon delivery. ""The boat is really an innovative concept because (it) melds together very modern lines and high technology with environmentally friendly features,"" says Giuseppe Palumbo, general manager of Palumbo Shipyards in Naples . Palumbo explains that the vessel's efficiencies are driven by twin electrical and diesel engines that combine performance to reduce emissions whilst simultaneously generating electricity for the ships myriad on board amenities. See also: Charter a superyacht like a billionaire . It also includes extra eco features such as a bilge water separator -- a device that extracts oil from sea water entering the vessel's engines before it is disposed back into the ocean. An all aluminum exterior and lightweight skeletal structure meanwhile ensure the ship is as slight and sleek as possible, therefore taking less energy to power, he adds. Although there may be other yachts that offer greater speeds or performance levels, the Sport 130' Hybrid ""enable(s) greater maneuverability,"" cuts noise pollution and reduces overall ""maintenance costs"" -- on top of the obvious environmental benefits, adds Palumbo. But while the vessel may stand out because of its high-tech eco friendly features, Palumbo is quick to ensure that it doesn't skimp on the traditionally ostentatious superyacht features as well. See also: The rise of the gigayacht . Four large cabins provide luxury accommodation for as many as eight guests at a time (served by seven crew members) while a spacious deck area ensures there is plenty of room for sunbathing, dining and partying come nightfall. A custom made lounge area crafted by Italian interior design specialists, Hot Lab Studio, meanwhile includes a number of prominent glass windows that provide spectacular vistas of the surrounding seas. Not only will this ensure that guests can enjoy panoramic ocean views, says Palumbo, but they will be able to do so safe in the knowledge that the environmental impact of their yachting extravagance is vastly reduced.","The Columbus Sport 130' Hybrid is the latest vessel from Palumbo Shipyards .

"(CNN) -- Three men who toppled an ancient boulder in Utah's Goblin Valley State Park have been booted from their Boy Scout leadership roles. Video of Glenn Taylor shoving the huge rock off a slender pedestal where its rested for millions of years went viral online and prompted media scrutiny. Taylor sang the rock song ""Wiggle It, Just a Little Bit"" as he pushed the delicate sculpture over, which was followed by laughter and high fives with his son. David Hall, who shot the video and posted it on Facebook, and the two Taylors were leading a Boy Scout group on a visit to the park when the incident happened. The National Boy Scouts of America and the organization's Utah National Parks Council issued almost simultaneous and similar statements Monday addressing the men's actions. ""After reviewing this matter with the local chartered organization, these men have been removed from their leadership positions and are no longer members of the BSA,"" the national statement said. The local council statement said the former leaders violated the Scouts' principle of ""Leave no trace,"" which it said ""teaches the value of natural areas and the methods we can use to help protect and conserve these areas for future generations."" The three men, all from Utah, defended their actions in interviews last week, saying the delicate structure posed a threat to visitors. But park officials suggested they broke the law by defacing a state park. The attention has led to revelations that Taylor filed a personal-injury lawsuit in September, claiming he had suffered ""serious, permanent and debilitating injuries"" from a 4-year-old car crash. ""Someone with a bad back who's disabled, who can't enjoy life, to me, doesn't step up and push a rock that big off the base,"" the defendant in Taylor's lawsuit, Alan MacDonald, told Salt Lake City television station KTVX. Taylor's lawyer did not return calls for comment. But when CNN affiliate KUTV noted that Taylor didn't look particularly debilitated in the video, he replied, ""You didn't see how hard I pushed."" CNN Legal Analyst Danny Cevallos said when someone has a pending disability lawsuit, ""You'd think they'd avoid the camera like the plague. ""But instead, they think no one will ever see it or repercussions will ever come of it,"" Cevallos said. Goblin Valley, in southern Utah, is home to thousands of the mushroom-shaped rocks -- known to locals as goblins -- that developed as millions of years of winds and water eroded sandstone cliffs. ""We have now modified Goblin Valley, a new Goblin Valley exists,"" Hall is heard saying at the end of his video. ""That's crazy that it was held up just by that little bit of dirt. Some little kid was about ready to walk down here and die and Glenn saved his life by getting the boulder out of the way. So it's all about saving lives here at Goblin Valley. Saving lives. That's what we're all about."" Hall told Utah television station KUTV that the boulder seemed unstable. ""That wasn't going to last very long at all,"" he told the CNN affiliate. ""One gust of wind and a family's dead."" Asked if he would do it again, he said, ""Absolutely, absolutely."" But Jeff Rasmussen, the deputy director of Utah State Parks and Recreation, said, ""It didn't look like a stiff wind to me."" ""Obviously, we're very concerned and upset that somebody would come and destroy this natural wonder that took millions of years to be formed,"" he told KUTV. In his 22 years on the job, he said he had not heard of any goblins rolling off their pedestals. Taylor has expressed regrets. ""I wish we would have been smart enough to go get a ranger 'cause it was wrong of us to be vigilantes, and I'm sorry I did that,"" he told CNN affiliate KSTU. ""We thought we were doing a good deed,"" Taylor told the affiliate. But the Emery County attorney or the Utah Attorney General may not agree, said Eugene Swalberg of Utah State Parks. The men ""are currently under criminal investigation,"" he said ont Friday. ""It gives you a pit in your stomach. There seems to be a lot of happiness and joy with the individuals doing this, and it's not right. This is not what you do at a natural scenic area.""

"(CNN) -- An offshore 6.9 magnitude earthquake and aftershocks shook the coast of Northern California and parts of Oregon on Sunday night, the U.S. Geological Survey said. No major damage or injuries were immediately reported. The main quake, centered in the Pacific Ocean about 50 miles west of Eureka, California, happened at 10:18 p.m. PT, the USGS said. The depth was about 10 miles. Mike Meltzer, in Ferndale, just southwest of Eureka, told CNN affiliate KTVU the he felt the quake for about 10 seconds. The only damage that he could see: A bottle fell over. ""I've been through a number of these,"" Meltzer, a bartender at Ferndale's Hotel Ivanhoe, told KTVU. ""It wasn't a jolter; it was a wave."" More than 15 aftershocks were reported in the area within five hours, the strongest of which was a 4.6 magnitude temblor in the ocean, according to the USGS. The strongest shaking was reported in the Eureka area, with weak motion felt in west-central Oregon and in the San Francisco area, according to the USGS. There is no tsunami threat, according to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center. The shaking drew a number of comments on social media. ""Long rumble, no damage,"" Twitter user @Amy_Stewart posted.

"(CNN) -- Peter Henderson heard gunshots ring out late Wednesday morning from the National War Memorial in downtown Ottawa, Canada, as workers were rolling into the office a little late, coffee in hand. ""I was locking my bike up, and I heard four shots,"" said Henderson, a journalist who reports on the telecom market. He looked toward the memorial's soaring granite arch and saw a fallen soldier, in ceremonial uniform with white gloves. The soldier had been standing guard at the monument with a second soldier. ""I saw one of the soldiers laying on the ground,"" Henderson said. The soldier appeared to be shot in the back, with ""catastrophic"" wounds, Henderson said. That soldier later died, according to a statement from the Ottawa Police Service and Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Other witnesses, including members of Parliament, flooded social media with accounts of the attack, including photos and videos. Collectively they painted a portrait of chaos breaking out on an otherwise routine day near the corridors of power in the Canadian capital. Police reported at least two shooting incidents in downtown Ottawa: at the National War Memorial Museum and on Parliament Hill. One suspect was killed, the police statement said, and the joint police operation continued throughout the afternoon in a search for possibly other suspects. In the immediate aftermath of the war-memorial shooting, the second soldier on guard duty ""ran for cover,"" Henderson said. The guards are thought to hold rifles that are not loaded, he added. The shots sounded like they came from a high-powered rifle, Henderson said. Later, bystanders rushed to the fallen soldier and began to perform CPR, he explained. ""To the best of my knowledge, (he) looked like ... a young man,"" Henderson said. ""It appeared as though he had been hit in the back several times."" At Parliament, shots rang out at around 10 a.m. ET as Parliament members, including Prime Minister Stephen Harper, prepared for caucus. Some members tweeted that they heard many shots. MP Tony Clement tweeted that he heard ""at least 30 shots"" and apparently was able to take cover with colleagues. He tweeted that Harper was secure. Canadian Deputy House Leader Kevin Lamoureux was attending a caucus meeting when security told everyone to clear the building. ""I honestly thought it was a fire alarm situation,"" Lamoureux told CNN. As soon as he was leaving the caucus room, he heard the gunfire, he said. ""I heard rapid fire -- gunshots going very loud -- and I figure maybe 20-plus shots within 10 seconds,"" Lamoureux said. He was inside Parliament, on the ground floor, when shots rang out. He was one level below the gunshots and was among those who were evacuated to another building nearby. There was panic as people rushed out a door, he said. Lamoureux said he heard no screaming or other sounds before the shots rang out. Lamoureux also saw the prime minister's motorcade leave the building. Parliament member Kyle Seeback tweeted: ""Horrific day on parliament hill. Shots fired inside centre block during our caucus meeting. I'm safe locked in a office awaiting security."" Another member Tony Clement tweeted, ""I'm with colleagues Mark Strahl and Kyle Seeback. PM was in Caucus but now secure. Assuming it's not safe to venture out yet ..."" Clement tweeted that there were ""at least 30 shots."" Ottawa journalist Josh Wingrove told CNN that he saw someone injured -- he described it as a motionless ""body"" -- in the main building, near the entrance to the Parliament library, following the gunfire. Wingrove was inside Parliament and heard dozens of shots. Wednesday morning's gunfire in the main Parliament building started in the foyer, and a second round of shooting happened about a minute later in a hallway or near the entrance to the Parliament's library, Wingrove said. Several officers had weapons drawn, and most of the dozens of shots that he heard appear to have been fired by officers at the gunman, Wingrove said. Wingrove was among those forced to remain in the building during a police lockdown, as officers checked each room, he said on his Twitter account. After the gunfight, ""the smell of gunpowder is heavy in the hallways,"" he tweeted. Matt Millar, the Ottawa bureau chief of the Vancouver Observer, was in the hallway above the gunfire in Parliament. He heard what he described as a very loud noise ""followed by several shouts and, by my count, about three dozen rounds of handgun fire."" He and colleagues escaped their office by breaking a window on the third story, and construction workers assembled scaffolding to help them, Millar said. But he and others had to undergo hours of lockdown Wednesday in a secure building ""just a stone's throw from (Parliament Hill)l,"" Millar told CNN. Member of Parliament John McKay recalled hearing ""pop, pop, pop"" as he was entering his caucus room. ""I was walking to my caucus room and literally taking off my coat when I heard this pop, pop, pop -- didn't really think much of it -- thought it was frankly construction"" on Parliament Hill, he told CNN. ""Then the security people came racing down the hall and ushered us out of the building ASAP."" When they arrived outside in the back of the Parliament buildings, ""a construction guy says maybe if there's people inside shooting, maybe we should be standing behind one of the monuments instead of standing out here like sitting ducks,"" McKay said. McKay and the group then found a monument as a shield against a potential gunman, he said. As the group talked about how the gunman apparently ventured near caucus rooms, ""at that point things really started to sink in and you realize it's a significant incident,"" McKay said. John Ivison, a political columnist for the National Post, was five minutes from Parliament Hill when reports came about the gunfire at the war memorial. He and a colleague arrived at the monument ""to find a scene that is going to change this country forever,"" Ivison wrote. Ivison's first-person account included a photograph he took of the mortally wounded soldier being attended by four people providing medical care. ""The young soldier was wearing a kilt -â€” he is a reservist from the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada in Hamilton â€” and appeared to have a bloody chest wound. The thought struck me that there should be a very special place in Hell reserved for a terrorist who shoots a soldier guarding the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier that honours this country's fallen,"" Ivison wrote. He posted a note on his Twitter page: ""Canada has just lost its innocence."" ""Maybe it was naÃ¯ve, we probably lost our innocence a long time ago. But there was a very real sense that nothing will ever be the same again,"" Ivison wrote in the National Post. Dutch tourist Jan Lugtenborg saw the gunman running from the war memorial to Parliament, he told CNN partner and Canadian broadcaster CBC. ""We were waiting there for a city tour and suddenly I heard four shots,"" Lugtenborg said. ""Suddenly I saw a small guy with long black hair ... with a long rifle, and he ran away after the shots, across streets in the direction of Parliament Hill."" Scott Walsh, who was working on Parliament Hill, told CBC that he saw a man running with a double-barrelled shotgun, wearing a scarf and blue jeans, who hopped over the stone fence surrounding Parliament Hill. The gunman forced someone out of a car and then drove to the front doors of Parliament and fired at least two shots, Walsh told CBC.","NEW: ""Suddenly I saw a small guy with long black hair,"" witness says of gunman .

"(CNN) -- Ever since two men first laid a bet on two flies climbing up a cave wall, gambling has struck at the core of the human condition: the future is uncertain. And while games of chance like dice and cards have been with us for centuries, bar room wagers on matters of abstract speculation have often been lost to history, disappearing as fast as the hot air that produced them. Until now, that is. Novelty bets . Thanks to websites like Longbets.org and professional gaming sites like Paddy Power, oddball bets on everything from the next pope to the life expectancy of the universe have a running book. In the case of Longbets.org, they are the source of heated debate about the shape of the future. ""These bets become an interesting tool to understand how we think about the future and even if we are really arguing about the right things,"" said Alexander Rose, director of the Long Now Foundation, which backs the Long Bets project. Betting exchanges that take novelty bets are nothing new -- Paddy Power has a long-running book on whether it will snow on Christmas Day and the next pope -- but what makes Long Bets different is that it will only accept bets that advance our understanding of science and the future. The winner also must donate their winnings to a charity of his choice. Predicting the future . So far, Long Bets has taken long-term bets on whether drones will do battle as part of protests, whether commercial flights will become pilotless and on the future of level of the world's population. ""People need to have an opposing argument and come to an agreement about the terms which actually turns out to be quite tricky,"" Rose told CNN. ""Someone will make a bet, for instance, that we will find extraterrestrial intelligence in the next 50 years, then there's often a long philosophical discussion about what constitutes extraterrestrial intelligence or even life. ""If we are talking about something as strange as that, we don't know even if we'd recognize it."" Often, he said, the parties have already bashed out the terms before they come to Long Bets. Buffett's million dollar gamble . In the case of its current highest profile bet -- a million dollar bet between billionaire investor Warren Buffett and alternative investment group ProtÃ©gÃ© Partners, LLC - the two parties had already agreed the terms and had come to Long Bets to find a platform for the wager. For a simple $50 fee, anyone can make a prediction, which then becomes a bet when someone takes up the challenge. Nothing is too outlandish, said Rose, as long as it is well argued. Often the results can be surprising. ""We had one bet on the cost of energy five years into the future and the parties had used a very good source which was the report of the US Department of Energy,"" he said. However, when it came time to adjudicate that bet it was found the government had pulled its report in the wake of the $74 billion Enron scandal in 2001. ""Enron had sufficiently skewed the energy market that the government had to unwind all the Enron trades out of its report to know the true cost of energy,"" Rose said. ""It was enough to flip the results of the bet."" Changing parameters . Often the future is so unpredictable that the parameters of the debate change entirely. Once such argument over whether the top 10 news stories would come from a blog or the Wall Street Journal was, at the time, surprisingly eclipsed by Wikipedia which was little known in 2002. ""We often find that it's not so much whether someone was right or wrong, but that what was being argued about was not even relevant,"" Rose said. ""Our main goal is that they create an interesting discussion about the future. And we try to keep them away from celebrities and sports and more on arguments about the world. ""We've taken a few bets on sports but only when they've been arguments about globalization."" Some have time scales so long, that no one will ever collect on them. Turing test . A bet on whether the universe will keep expanding is unlikely ever to see a winner, but a $20,000 bet between Google's director of engineering Ray Kurzweil and Lotus Development founder Mitchell Kapor on artificial intelligence passing the Turing test comes up in 2029. To pass the test, a machine or computer program must convince a human judge that it has a level of intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human being. For mainstream punters, meanwhile, betting exchanges like Paddy Power have been taking novelty bets on everything from the next pope - more than Â£300,000 ($450,000) was placed after Pope Benedict's resignation -- to parents betting on their sons becoming soccer World Cup football captains. ""For us it's really a fraction of our business, less than 1%, but it's very good for our profile and we like doing it,"" Paddy Power told CNN. ""And anyway who knows? One day we'll all be caught with our pants down when Elvis comes back into town."" Read more from Tomorrow Transformed: . FireChat, the app that voiced Hong Kong's protests .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- At least nine Libyan soldiers were killed in fighting between government forces and Islamist militants in Benghazi on Friday, officials said. The fighting began when members of the Islamist armed group Ansar al Sharia and other ""criminal groups"" attacked the headquarters of the Benghazi security directorate early Friday, the Libyan interim government said in a statement. Health officials said 19 soldiers and policemen were wounded, and some of the attackers were also killed, wounded or taken captive, according to the government. Residents and activists reported explosions and intense gunfire that lasted about an hour at dawn before army special forces troops took control of the area. The government said the attackers used small, medium and heavy weapons in their assault. The government condemned the attack and praised the special forces and other security personnel in Benghazi ""for their resilience."" The statement went on to say the government will not ""allow the presence of terrorists or armed criminal groups that operate outside the legitimacy of the state, it will not allow states within a state."" Security forces in Benghazi, Libya's second-largest city, have often been targets of assassinations and bomb attacks blamed on Islamist extremist groups. On Tuesday, at least two soldiers were killed and a number of others were wounded when a car bomb blew up outside an army base in Benghazi. While no group has claimed responsibility for the violence that has gripped the eastern city, residents and officials have blamed it on groups including Ansar al Sharia, which has clashed with the army in recent months. The United States designated the militant group a terrorist organization this year for its involvement in violence in Benghazi, including the U.S. Consulate attack in 2012. The security situation in Benghazi has been a major challenge for the Libyan government, with near daily assassinations and kidnappings, which mostly target security forces. There has been growing concern about the increasing presence and influence of radical militant groups in the North African country after the 2011 revolution that overthrew the Gadhafi regime. A recently released annual report by the U.S. State Department on global terrorism trends singled out Libya as an area of concern and instability. ""Libya's porous borders, the weakness of Libya's nascent security institutions, and large amounts of loose small arms create opportunities for violent extremists,"" the report said. During an official visit to the Libyan capital last week, Deputy Secretary of State William Burns voiced his concerns about the situation and pledged U.S. support to Libya. ""The rising threat of violent extremism, whether it is people using violence for political purposes or the role of terrorist groups, is an enormous challenge first and foremost to the people of Libya, but also to Libya's international partners as well. We recognize the severity of that threat,"" he told reporters in Tripoli. ""We have all suffered from it, whether it is Americans or Libyans or others around the world, and that is why we have such a sense of urgency, and such a sense of determination, to help Libyans build their own security capacity, to deepen counterterrorism cooperation, and also to promote the kind of healthy political process and economic process that increases the chances for greater security over the long term.""","Benghazi security directorate headquarters attacked early Friday, Libyan government says .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A lawyer who filed a teen sex abuse lawsuit against ""X-Men"" director Bryan Singer said three more ""Hollywood types"" will be targeted in similar suits soon. Michael Egan, who accuses Singer of sexually abusing him starting when he was 15, appeared with attorney Jeff Herman at a news conference in Beverly Hills on Thursday. ""I was a piece of meat,"" Egan, now 31, told reporters. ""There was no relationship."" The civil suit filed in U.S. District Court in Hawaii on Wednesday alleged that Singer offered the aspiring teen actor a role in an ""X-Men"" film if he gave in to his sexual demands, while threatening to destroy his career if he didn't. Singer's representative said the accusations were ""completely without merit."" ""We are very confident that Bryan will be vindicated in this absurd and defamatory lawsuit,"" Singer's representative said. ""It is obvious that this case was filed in an attempt to get publicity at the time when Bryan' s new movie is about to open in a few weeks."" Singer is one of Hollywood's most successful directors and producers, having directed two installments of the ""X-Men"" film franchise and a Superman movie in the past 15 years. His next film, ""X-Men: Days of Future Past,"" is set to hit theaters on May 23. Fox, the studio distributing the X-Men movies, issued a statement about the accusations Thursday. ""These are serious allegations, and they will be resolved in the appropriate forum. This is a personal matter, which Bryan Singer and his representatives are addressing separately."" Herman said he chose Hawaii to file the suit because the legislature there opened a window for two years allowing old sex abuse cases to be filed. The provision expires next week. The alleged incidents detailed in the lawsuit happened in 1998 and 1999, the suit said. Most of the alleged sex abuse took place at parties at a California mansion, while other incidents allegedly happened during two trips to Hawaii. Singer ""manipulated his power, wealth and position in the entertainment industry to sexually abuse and exploit the underage plaintiff through the use of drugs, alcohol, threats and inducements which resulted in plaintiff suffering catastrophic psychological and emotional injuries,"" the complaint alleged. Singer ""promised acting roles to plaintiff in an X-Men movie, in commercials, and in other of his projects, and professed that he would arrange for plaintiff to audition for roles and projects in others' productions,"" it alleged. Egan said when his mother learned about the abuse when he was 17 she called the Los Angeles Police, who then brought in the FBI. Although he gave a statement to investigators, it ""fell on deaf ears"" and nothing came of the investigation, he said. The FBI spokeswoman in Los Angeles told CNN the agency would not confirm or deny that there was an investigation or why it might not have been pursued. The lawsuit said that most of the alleged sex abuse took place at parties hosted at an Encino, California, mansion, by a man who Egan and two other young men successfully sued in 2004 for sex abuse. The men won a $4 million judgment against him, but Singer was not a defendant in that case. Egan and other teen boys were allegedly lured with incentives and threats, the suit said. ""He was advised that those adult males controlled Hollywood and would destroy his hopes and dreams of an acting career if he did not keep them happy,"" the suit said. ""They threatened to 'eliminate' him and his family, and told him that they were monitoring not only his phone, but those of his family members, and asserted he would be 'destroyed' if he ever disclosed the unconscionable activities that occurred at the estate."" Singer ""was present for, and participated in, several of these threatening communications,"" the complaint alleged. Egan ""never freely, voluntarily, and knowingly consented to these sexual interactions, and often resisted them,"" it said. ""The parties were typically sordid and featured sexual contact between adult males and the many teenage boys who were present for the parties,"" the suit said. The teens were seduced by the ""distraction of alcohol and drugs,"" it said. ""The nature of the parties was well-known and notorious among many men in the Hollywood entertainment industry,"" the complaint said. Singer allegedly gave Egan ""drugs, including cocaine, a pill identified as 'green triangle' which is believed to be a reference to the drug Ecstasy, Xanax, Rohypnol, pain pills believed to be Vicodin or Percocet, and alcoholic beverages,"" the suit said.Â . Singer ""promised acting roles to plaintiff in an X-Men movie, in commercials, and in other of his projects, and professed that he would arrange for plaintiff to audition for roles and projects in others' productions,"" it alleged. Egan told reporters that after the FBI declined to help, he gave up on his dream of being an actor and ""buried it in me as deeply as I possibly could."" After years of drinking ""to numb the pain,"" he became sober two years ago and began trauma therapy to ""deal with deep-rooted issues,"" Egan said. ""I am a survivor of childhood sexual abuse,"" he said. ""At the end of the day, we are not going to stop and change anything unless people come forward."" Herman said he has been working for six months to uncover teen sex abuse cases in Hollywood, some more recent than Egan's. ""We suspect these things are still going on in Hollywood,"" he said. He said it was a silent conspiracy that ""goes from the bottom to the top of Hollywood"" with studios ""looking the other way."" ""It's the worst kept secret around, because it has been going on for years in Hollywood,"" Herman said. CNN's Carolyn Sung contributed to this report.","NEW: ""I was a piece of meat,"" plaintiff says .

"(CNN) -- No one ever expected the humble pencil to kickstart a revolution. But, by peeling apart pencil graphite into atom-thick layers using regular adhesive tape, two Russian-born scientists, Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov, earned a Nobel Prize in 2010. With it, they sparked the beginnings of a material that could change the world. It is no exaggeration to say that graphene, the substance that the two scientists -- along with others -- discovered in 2004, is a miracle material. Now a Korean research lab may have made the leap from theoretical to practical with the development of a new way to synthesize it, potentially on a commercial scale. The substance, ""the perfect atomic lattice,"" boasts a number of hugely attractive properties, meaning it has the potential to be used in myriad industries, and for a huge range of purposes. Attractive properties . As well as being super-strong -- 20 times stronger than diamond, 200 stronger than steel and six times lighter -- it is also remarkably conductive, both electrically and thermally. If that wasn't enough, it is also almost perfectly transparent, impermeable to gas, and its properties are, scientists say, easily alterable. Graphene is one form -- an allotrope -- of carbon, the basis of all life on earth. More familiar carbon allotropes include diamonds and graphite. What makes it unique is its thinness -- at one atom thick it is as good as two-dimensional. Its flexibility means that it could potentially be used for flexible or wearable devices. ""Graphene has a lot of potential, especially in terms of industrial applications for optical and electronic devices,"" says Ping Sheng, a Professor of Nanoscience at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. ""The caveat is really in the quality of the graphene that can be produced on a large scale ... If they can overcome that then it will be a big breakthrough."" Another byproduct of its remarkable thinness is its low weight. It could be used to create ultra-light components for, say, the aviation industry, dramatically reducing the weight of aircraft -- and thus significantly improving fuel efficiency -- without compromising strength or integrity. The substance is so versatile that it has even been touted as the future of condoms. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation last year awarded a $100,000 grant to fund the development of graphene prophylactics. Drawbacks . Currently, its limitations include the fact that its conductivity can't be turned ""off,"" meaning that as a semiconductor it is useless, although researchers are experimenting with the substance to figure out a way around this problem. One possible fix could be to build artificial breaks in the substance, allowing for circuits to be opened and closed, or to alter its properties with the use of chemicals. If this deficiency can be overcome, however, graphene could be used in a huge range of devices as a super-fast replacement for silicon transistors, which are already reaching their capacity. Graphene has one hundred times the electron mobility of silicon. Another limitation comes in the form of its production -- currently it can only be synthesized in small crystals. While this is enough for researchers to test its properties and understand the tantalizing benefits of the material, it is not sufficient to produce it for mass commercial use. But with an announcement made last week, all this could change. Public- and private-sector funding . Governments and the private sector are actively exploring the potential of the substance, with the EU devoting â‚¬1 billion ($1.3 billion) to it between 2013 and 2023, funding research which could potentially transform a range of sectors, including electronics, energy, health and construction. The Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology last week announced it had developed ""a breakthrough synthesis method"" of producing graphene, and the hopes are that this will pave the way for the commercialization of the material. The results were published in the journal Science. Samsung sees graphene as the ""perfect material"" for next generation device, and the breakthrough could have huge implications for its commercial production. ""This is one of the most significant breakthroughs in graphene research in history,"" researchers said in a statement released by the company. ""We expect this discovery to accelerate the commercialization of graphene, which could unlock the next era of consumer electronic technology."" In partnership with with Sungkyunkwan University, the Institute has pioneered the growing of large-area, single crystal wafer scale graphene. Previously, small graphene particles had been combined to form large-area graphene, but the process diminished both the mechanic and electric effectiveness of the substance. The material's conductivity would make charging a device take a matter of seconds, and its strength, durability and flexibility would allow Samsung to truly innovate with a whole range of new devices and ways to interact with technology. It has not been revealed if Samsung plans to make the groundbreaking synthesis process public, a move that would rapidly accelerate the adoption of graphene into daily use. However, Sheng thinks that it won't be long before the process is widely available. ""I don't think they can keep it proprietary very long, even if they want to ... This will start many factories around the world doing the same thing."" READ MORE: Graphene: The nano-sized material with a massive future .

"(CNN) -- A Christian woman in Sudan reportedly has until Thursday to either recant her faith or face a possible sentence of death. Meriam Yehya Ibrahim, 27, was convicted by a Khartoum court this week of apostasy, or the renunciation of faith, Amnesty International said Wednesday, a day before the expected ruling. The court considers her to be Muslim. According to the rights group, she was also convicted of adultery because her marriage to a Christian man was considered void under Sharia law. ""The fact that a woman could be sentenced to death for her religious choice, and to flogging for being married to a man of an allegedly different religion, is abhorrent and should never be even considered,"" Manar Idriss, Amnesty International's Sudan researcher, said in a statement. ""'Adultery' and 'apostasy' are acts which should not be considered crimes at all, let alone meet the international standard of 'most serious crimes' in relation to the death penalty. It is flagrant breach of international human rights law,"" the researcher said. Ibrahim is eight months pregnant and currently in custody with her 20-month-old son, according to Amnesty International, which considers her a prisoner of conscience. Christian Solidarity Worldwide, another rights group, described Ibrahim's case as follows: . She was born to a Sudanese Muslim father and an Ethiopian Orthodox mother. Her father left when she was 6 years old, and Ibrahim was raised by her mother as a Christian. However, because her father was Muslim, she was considered by the courts to be the same, which would mean her marriage to a non-Muslim man is void. In past cases involving pregnant or nursing women, the Sudanese government waited until the mother weaned her child before executing any sentence, said Christian Solidarity Worldwide spokeswoman Kiri Kankhwende. After-hours attempts Wednesday to contact the Justice Minister and Foreign Affairs Minister in Sudan were unsuccessful. Foreign embassies in Khartoum are urging the government there to reverse course. ""We call upon the Government of Sudan to respect the right to freedom of religion, including one's right to change one's faith or beliefs, a right which is enshrined in international human rights law as well as in Sudan's own 2005 Interim Constitution,"" the embassies of the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and Netherlands said in a statement. ""We further urge Sudanese legal authorities to approach Ms. Meriam's case with justice and compassion that is in keeping with the values of the Sudanese people,"" it read. Journalist Isma'il Kushkush contributed to this report.","Meriam Yehya Ibrahim, 27, was convicted of apostasy and adultery .

The stakes were pretty high for the elastic-faced funnyman, whose new movie ""Dumb and Dumber To"" comes out next month. Preliminary reviews of his SNL performance were mixed, but there's no denying that Carrey rose to the occasion, leading to some hilarious scenes. He took a trip down memory lane as the SNL cast impersonated his biggest roles in a family reunion, which included a cameo from ""Dumb and Dumber"" co-star Jeff Daniels. Other memorable moments included a parody within a parody with his take on actor Matthew McConaughey's odd Lincoln car commercials. He also showed off his penchant for physical comedy in a dance-off with ""SNL"" cast member Kate McKinnon to Sia's ""Chandelier"" music video, complete with nude body suits and a cameo from musical guest Iggy Azalea.

"(CNN) -- ""The Adventures of Tintin"" is the first of two Steven Spielberg movies to hit theaters this week, the second being ""War Horse,"" on Christmas Day. ""Tintin"" is the obvious popcorn movie of the two, the crowd-pleaser: ""Jurassic Park"" to the other's prestige-hungry ""Schindler's List."" It's also the better of the two -- a buoyant, breathlessly-paced motion capture animated adventure that puts the last ""Indiana Jones"" movie to shame. Maybe I'm biased. I grew up reading HergÃ©'s comic books about the escapades of the intrepid young reporter, his valiant fox terrier Snowy, and their blundering ally Captain Haddock. Like ""Indiana Jones,"" ""Tintin"" exists in a lost world of colonial exploration and adventure. His Belgian creator, who signed himself HergÃ©, was 15 when Howard Carter discovered Tutankhamun's tomb in 1922, and 26 when King Kong climbed the Empire State. His stories cling to the romance of those tall tales, real and imaginary. Tintin had a knack for finding himself in the wrong place at the wrong time -- or the ""right"" place and time, depending on your point of view. Where other reporters might have to dig out a story, mystery knocked on Tintin's door -- introducing him to bizarre characters and whisking him to exotic locations in Africa, Central America, or (once) the Moon. Spielberg jokily introduces his hero through a street artist's quick sketch, before abandoning the familiar 2-D cartoon for a new 3-D, motion capture model. To my eyes there's something disconcertingly creepy about the new look -- designed at Peter Jackson's WETA studios. Still, you get used to it, and underneath his placid, plastic, doll-like surface it's the same old Tintin: a pale, round-faced young man with a tuft of marmalade hair perked on his forehead and a fondness for pants that come down to just an inch below the knee. No sooner has he picked up a model sailing ship at a flea market than he finds himself at the center of an intense bidding war for the self-same object. When he refuses to sell, the model is stolen from his home and a stranger is gunned down on his doorstep. Hidden in the ship is one third of a treasure map. The dastardly Ivanovich Sakharine has his hands on a second section and means to piece the whole thing together, but he also needs the drunken sea captain Haddock to help him decipher it. Fortunately Tintin helps the skipper escape Sakharine's clutches and then the race is one for the missing third, which is in the possession of an Arab sheikh with a fondness for opera. Such antics might seem positively antiquarian, but the story moves at a good lick and Spielberg's touch is lighter than we've seen in his live action movies for years. A shoot-out and chase in an old steamship is expertly handled, but the sequence moves up a gear when Tintin and the permanently inebriated Haddock are stranded in a rowboat, then another when they commandeer a sea plane that's running out of fuel -- and the best is yet to come: a gravity-defying race through the Casbah which bends physics with the glee you can only find in 3-D animation. It's delirious stuff, often laugh-out-loud funny, which isn't surprising with screenplay writers like Steven Moffat (the writer behind the BBC's recent ""Dr Who"" and ""Sherlock Holmes"" revivals), Edgar Wright (""Shaun of the Dead"") and Joe Cornish (""Attack the Block""). A running gag in which Snowy is always a step ahead of his newshound pal is especially sweet. I might quibble about the voice casting. Jamie Bell's Tintin is fine, but as fans will know, it's the redoubtable dipsomaniac Captain Haddock who keeps the show ticking over. Andy Serkis may be the motion-capture king, but Haddock's voice isn't near as robust and earthy as I used to hear it in my head. In fairness, my 6-year-old did not share this concern. And it's a pleasure to find a movie we both enjoyed as much as this one. The bar has been set. We'll have to wait and see if Peter Jackson can match it in the next one.","""Tintin"" exists in a lost world of colonial exploration and adventure .

"(CNN) -- Comcast, the nation's largest cable provider, wants to acquire Time Warner Cable, the nation's second-largest cable provider. Should we be concerned? I certainly am; that's why I oppose this deal. And I'm not alone. More than 100,000 people -- including many from my own state of Minnesota -- have written to me expressing frustration that they are already paying significantly higher prices for increasingly poor cable and broadband service. Many note that they are unable to get a better deal because, where they live, there is only one viable option (in Minnesota, it's usually Comcast). And they worry that this deal will only make things worse. Comcast takes merger case to Washington . Comcast dismisses these concerns by pointing out that it does not directly compete with Time Warner Cable in any zip code -- as if that's supposed to reassure us. But the fact that the two biggest cable companies have already effectively managed to carve the country up into local monopolies shouldn't make us feel any better about their plan to become one giant company. Indeed, it's a clear sign that the cable market needs more competition, not less. As for satellite TV and wireless Internet providers -- which Comcast would have you believe are forcing it and Time Warner Cable to band together in an uphill battle for survival -- they simply don't represent real competition. Comcast grilled in Senate over merger plans . You can get your TV from a satellite provider, but it usually won't come with high-speed broadband Internet. And wireless Internet is not a viable substitute for broadband -- particularly if you want to watch TV online. Essentially, if you want both TV service and high-speed Internet, you are stuck with a big cable and broadband company like Comcast or Time Warner Cable -- ""or"" being the appropriate preposition here, because, as Comcast brags, many Americans already have just one of these companies to choose from where they live. And if this deal goes through, Comcast will become the only option for millions more consumers. The danger in allowing Comcast to accrue even more power is not purely hypothetical. The company is already using its dominant position to dictate terms to content providers seeking to reach its 20 million customers. Take Netflix, for example. Comcast, which happens to have a rival video streaming service of its own, was able to exploit Netflix's growing popularity by refusing to provide the network infrastructure needed to keep Netflix streaming smoothly. In the end, Netflix had to pay Comcast an undisclosed amount of money to get direct access to Comcast's broadband network and alleviate the slowdown. As Netflix CEO Reed Hastings wrote, ""Some big ISPs are extracting a toll because they can -- they effectively control access to millions of consumers and are willing to sacrifice the interests of their own customers to press Netflix and others to pay."" ""Extracting a toll"" is a polite way of putting it; this is nothing short of extortion. And acquiring Time Warner Cable would give Comcast millions more customers to use as leverage. If Comcast is able to effectively charge popular providers extra for access to broadband customers, those costs will inevitably be passed on to consumers themselves. And if Comcast is able to determine what traffic can make it into consumers' homes, content not owned by Comcast could become harder to find online. When the Senate Judiciary Committee recently met to review the proposed acquisition, Comcast -- which is represented by 107 lobbyists, including several who have passed through the ever-revolving door between the company and the agencies charged with regulating it -- promised to forgo such behavior. But the company's own actions have already proven that such promises are not to be believed. For example, three years ago, when Comcast announced plans to acquire NBC Universal, I and others raised concerns about vertical integration: Comcast already owned the pipes through which cable programming flowed, and now it would own NBC Universal's programming, including NBC, MSNBC, CNBC, Bravo, Telemundo, and others -- more than 20 networks in all. Fortune: Blocking Comcast-TWC will not fix America's Internet monopoly . As a nod to these concerns, the Federal Communications Commission required as a condition of the deal that Comcast ""neighborhood"" -- or group -- cable channels into categories, so that programming not owned by Comcast wouldn't be relegated to the far reaches of the dial where viewers would be unlikely to find it. But once the acquisition went through, Comcast didn't comply with this condition. It refused to put rival Bloomberg News in the same ""neighborhood"" as its own news channels, MSNBC and CNBC -- a textbook example of the kind of anti-competitive behavior we warned about, and in which Comcast promised not to engage. As another condition, Comcast was told by the FCC to create a stand-alone broadband product -- one that wasn't bundled with a cable TV package -- so that people who wanted to ditch their cable plans in favor of online services like Hulu and Netflix would have an option. Indeed, Comcast did create such a product. One small problem: It failed to tell customers about it. And after receiving complaints, the FCC fined Comcast for failing to live up to this obligation. Now Comcast plans to expand its empire by gobbling up the second-largest company in the cable market (and third-largest in broadband), a move that, as even Comcast's executive vice president admits, could mean that rates will rise at an even faster pace. Not to mention worse service -- and a threat to the free flow of information in America. That's why I will continue to make the case against this deal. And I hope that, Comcast's outsized political influence notwithstanding, regulators at the FCC and the Department of Justice will listen. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.","Sen.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Clothing retailer Gap Inc. has fired an Indian company accused of using child labor to make clothes, the company's president said. Dan McDougall of the Observer said these were among the children working in an Indian factory, making clothing. ""It's deeply, deeply disturbing to all of us,"" Gap President Marka Hansen said Sunday after watching a video of children at work in a New Delhi, India, sweatshop. ""I feel violated and I feel very upset and angry with our vendor and the subcontractor who made this very, very, very unwise decision,"" Hansen said. Hansen blamed the alleged abuse on an unauthorized subcontractor for one of its Indian vendors and said the subcontractor's relationship with the Gap had been ""terminated."" She said the garments allegedly produced by the children represented a small portion of a single order placed with the vendor and that the clothes would not be sold in stores. ""We strictly prohibit the use of child labor,"" Hansen said in a statement. ""Gap has a history of addressing challenges like this head-on, and our approach to this situation will be no exception. ""In 2006, Gap Inc. ceased business with 23 factories due to code violations. We have 90 people located around the world whose job is to ensure compliance with our Code of Vendor Conduct."" The report first appeared Sunday in Britain's Observer newspaper.  Watch how children worked as virtual slaves » . The Observer spoke to children as young as 10 who said they were working 16 hours a day for no pay. The paper described the workplace as a ""derelict industrial unit"" where the hallways were flowing with excrement from a flooded toilet. One 10-year-old boy told the paper he was sold to the company by his parents. ""'I was bought from my parents' village in [the northern state of] Bihar and taken to New Delhi by train,"" The Observer quoted the boy as saying. ""The men came looking for us in July. They had loudspeakers in the back of a car and told my parents that, if they sent me to work in the city, they won't have to work in the farms. My father was paid a fee for me, and I was brought down with 40 other children."" Another boy, 12, said he worked from dawn until 1 a.m. and was so tired he felt sick, according to the paper. But if any of the children cried, he told The Observer, they would be hit with a rubber pipe or punished with an oily cloth stuffed in their mouths. The children were producing hand-stitched blouses for the Christmas market in the United States and Europe at Gap Kids stores, according to the newspaper. The blouses were to carry a price of about $40, The Observer reported. The Gap faced criticism for similar practices in 2000, when a BBC documentary uncovered young girls producing Gap products at a Cambodian factory. But since then, Hansen said, the company has developed comprehensive policies to prevent abuse and protect workers' rights. Hansen said violations of those policies are now ""extremely rare."" She said she does not support closing any factories in India in response to the allegations because it would deprive those working in proper conditions of their income. The Gap also operates Banana Republic and Old Navy stores. It has 3,100 stores around the world. E-mail to a friend .","Clothes giant fires contractor at center of child labor allegations .

"(CNN) -- Historic flooding in the Balkans sent tens of thousands of people scrambling to higher ground on Sunday and sparked concerns that landmines from the Bosnian war could surface in mudslides, putting rescuers' lives at risk. ""A vast number of landslides have worsened the situation and relief efforts,"" the Red Cross said, describing the rains as the ""worst floods in more than a century."" ""There are reports that landmines buried during the conflict and not yet removed are in some instances being shifted with the landslides, adding (to) the dangers of people living in the areas as well as rescuers,"" the Red Cross said. In Serbia, the severe flooding has prompted the evacuation of at least 24,300 people. Dragan Radovanovic, president of the Serbian branch of the Red Cross, said the number of people affected by the high water is actually much larger. Many people stayed in the houses or apartments, one rescuer told Reuters. ""Some people simply do not want to leave their homes,"" Novica Biorac, a volunteer from a rafting club in Raska, said. ""We are trying to convince them to leave, but it's very difficult."" Water in some places was chest high as rescuers shouted up to people in buildings who are stranded. One woman lowered a bucket, and a worker put a loaf of bread in it. ""Thank you, please come back again and also let us know what the time is. I have a clock but don't have any batteries,"" she shouted to the rescue team, according to Reuters. Twelve bodies have been recovered in Obrenovac, about 35 kilometers (22.7 miles) from the capital of Belgrade, the Serbian government said Sunday evening. One of the 12 was someone who had already died ""of natural causes,"" Serbian Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic said, according to a government statement. Authorities estimate that 90% of the town has been flooded. At least 13 people are dead in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Deputy Minister of Security Samir Agic said. The toll is likely to go even higher, officials cautioned. One of the deceased was a rescuer, Radovanovic said, though he said he knew of five deaths in Serbia. It's the worst flooding Serbia has seen since the country began keeping records 120 years ago, according to meteorologists. ""Many cities and villages in western Serbia are completely under water,"" the Serbian Embassy in Washington said in a statement Sunday, describing the situation as ""critical"" and an ""unimaginable catastrophe."" Volunteers, soldiers and rescue workers have stacked sandbags in towns near rivers throughout the country, the statement said. The catastrophic weather has prompted authorities to declare a state of emergency in neighboring Bosnia and Herzegovina, according to a government statement. Bosnian authorities say the flooded town of Maglaj received the average rainfall for two months in less than two days. The Prime Minister pointed out that a dam 7.3 meters tall (24 feet) has been erected, but that the current level of the Sava River is over 6.3 meters -- a historic high. The river is expected to rise near Belgrade. He warned that it is difficult to predict what will happen if the river reaches 6.8 meters, or slightly more than 22 feet. In Kostolac, along the Danube River, workers were building sandbag walls to protect the thermal power plant there, one the energy minister called the most important power facility in Serbia. A written statement said it produces 20% of the nation's power. The Prime Minister thanked the many countries that have already come to Serbia's aid. He was especially grateful to members of the Russian special forces, highlighting one member who swam 200 meters (656 feet) in cold water to save several people. Russia and Israel each announced Sunday they would send relief supplies. According to Finance Minister Dusan Vujovic, more than 10,000 troops have already been involved in rescue and assistance operations.

"Washington (CNN) -- The House of Representatives voted Tuesday night to approve a Senate bill to avert a feared fiscal cliff. The measure that sought to maintain tax cuts for most Americans but increase rates on the wealthy passed the Democratic-led Senate overwhelmingly early in the day. There was discussion about amending the Senate bill by adding spending cuts, but in the end, House lawmakers voted on the bill as written -- a so-called up or down vote. Get the latest updates from CNN's political team . The legislation would raise roughly $600 billion in new revenues over 10 years, according to various estimates. ""I'd say let's take the Senate deal, fight another day,"" Rep. Tom Cole, R-Oklahoma, told CNN before the House vote. He predicted the House would pass the bill with a ""pretty strong bipartisan majority."" ""I'm a very reluctant yes,"" said Rep. Nan Hayworth, an outgoing Republican representative from New York. ""This is the best we can do given the Senate and the White House sentiment at this point in time, and it is at least a partial victory for the American people,"" she said. ""I'll take that at this point."" The timing of the vote was crucial, as a new Congress is set to be sworn in Thursday. The legislation averted much of the fiscal cliff's negative near-term economic impact by extending the Bush-era tax cuts for the majority of Americans. It also extends long-term unemployment benefits that were set to expire. Had the House not acted, and the tax cuts enacted last decade expired fully, broad tax increases would have kicked in, as would $110 billion in automatic cuts to domestic and military spending.

"(CNN) -- The flow of undocumented immigrants into the United States has slowed in the past three years, a major think tank reported Thursday. Illegal immigrants are processed in August at a U.S. Border Patrol station near Laredo, Texas. The Pew Hispanic Center report cites no statistical reasons for the decreased rate. It notes that the U.S. economy has suffered a downturn and that greater immigration enforcement measures have been enacted, which a Pew survey ""indicates has generated worry among many Hispanics."" According to the center's estimates, 11.9 million undocumented immigrants were living in the United States as of March. There were 11.1 million in 2005 and 8.4 million in 2000, the group said. ""Although the undocumented population has been rising, its net growth has slowed substantially since 2005, compared with earlier in the decade,"" the report states. According to the report, from 2000 to early 2005, the unauthorized immigrant population grew by an annual net average of about 525,000. The growth pattern started changing substantially in 2005. From 2005 to 2008, annual growth has averaged 275,000 undocumented immigrants.  See how the numbers stack up » . ""With the drop in the numbers of illegals coming, we now have more legal immigrants coming than illegals coming,"" said Jeffrey S. Passel, the study's lead researcher and author. Unauthorized immigrants continue to make up 30 percent of the nation's foreign-born population of more than 39 million people, the study says. Mexicans account for 58 percent of all illegal immigrants in the United States, the study says, adding that no other country has a double-digit share. Pew estimates that there were 7 million illegal Mexican immigrants living in the United States in March, up considerably from 4.8 million during the 2000 Census. Growth has leveled off since 2007. The number of undocumented immigrants in the United States from Latin American countries other than Mexico grew from 1.8 million in 2000 to 2.6 million in 2008, an increase of nearly 45 percent. That population reached 3 million in March 2006 but has declined since then, the report said. A previous Pew Hispanic Center showed that immigration from Mexico ""varied substantially directly related to the employment situation in the United States,"" Passel said. That appears to be the case now, he added. ""This slowdown [in the U.S. economy], if anything, hits some sectors that undocuments [illegal immigrants] are involved in very hard: construction, obviously, being a big one,"" he said. ""The other side of it is that a lot of Latin American economies are holding their own or doing well."" Stricter law enforcement has not been confined to the U.S.-Mexico border, Passel said. ""The other big difference over the past couple of years is that we've seen greater enforcement in the interior, at the work sites,"" he said. ""Numerically, there may not have been a big impact in terms of the numbers of people arrested and deported, but it's been very high profile. There's strong communication between the United States and the home country, so word gets back."" Among the study's other findings: . • More than 40 percent of the nation's undocumented immigrants -- 5.3 million people -- have arrived since the decade began.  • About 80 percent of undocumented immigrants come from Latin American countries. In March 2008, 9.6 million people from Latin America were living illegally in the United States. Another Pew Hispanic Center study released Thursday looks at the economy, saying the current economic slowdown ""has taken a far greater toll on non-citizen immigrants than it has on the United States population as a whole."" According to an analysis of new Census Bureau data, the median annual income of non-citizen immigrant households fell 7.3 percent from 2006 to 2007. In contrast, the median annual income of all U.S. households increased 1.3 percent during the same period, the report says. Immigrant heads of household who are not U.S. citizens are more vulnerable, the report says, because ""most arrived in the U.S. in recent years with only a high school education or less. Many are employed in blue-collar production and construction occupations or lower-rung occupations in the service sector."" The majority (56 percent) of non-citizen households are Hispanic. And nearly half (45 percent) of non-citizen households are headed by undocumented immigrants. The Pew Hispanic Center is a part of the Pew Research Center in Washington and is an independent research group that does not engage in advocacy or take positions on issues.","Illegals still arriving, but at lower rate, Pew Hispanic Center study says .

"(CNN) -- There are not many sportsmen who can call themselves ""The Greatest"" and not be greeted with ridicule -- former world heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali is one of the few who can lay claim to such unrivaled supremacy. The Kentucky native turned 70 Tuesday, prompting people from across the world to pay tribute to a former boxer who has shown his fighting spirit both inside and outside the ring during an extraordinary life. ""Everything that Ali has done and stood for, you can only aspire to be like him,"" Tris Dixon, editor of Boxing News, told CNN. ""He was the king in the biggest and best era of heavyweight champions."" Ali rose to prominence at the 1960 Olympics in Rome, where he won a gold medal in the light heavyweight division fighting under his birth name of Cassius Clay. Hana Ali: My dad, Muhammad Ali . After converting to Islam in 1964, Clay was renamed Muhammad Ali and went on to participate in some of the most memorable contests in the history of sport. Ali's boxing career is perhaps best remembered for two of his most famous fights against two of his fiercest rivals. In Zaire in October 1974, Ali upset the odds to reclaim the WBA and WBC world heavyweight titles against George Foreman in a bout dubbed the ""Rumble in the Jungle."" A year later, Ali squared off against the late Joe Frazier for the third time in his career. The fight in the Philippines, known as the ""Thrilla in Manilla,"" lasted 14 devastating rounds, with Ali taking glory when Frazier was unable to make the bell at the start of the 15th. But, for Dixon, it was a third-round knockout of Cleveland Williams in a 1966 fight for the world heavyweight title which best displayed Ali's boxing talents. ""Against Cleveland Williams, that was Ali at his best,"" he explained. ""It was utter poetry. It was just immense ... it was punch perfect against a world-class opponent."" Ali eventually retired in 1981 with a record of 56 wins, 37 by knockout, and five losses in 61 bouts. He began an altogether different fight in 1984, when he was diagnosed with neurological disorder Parkinson's syndrome. In 1996, at the age of 54, Ali provided one of the iconic images of the Atlanta Olympics when he lit the torch to declare the Games open. Ali also received a replacement gold medal for the one he had won 36 years earlier, having thrown the original into the Ohio River after being refused entry to a restaurant. Despite Ali's advancing years, Dixon claimed his legacy is still as strong and relevant as it has ever been. ""There will never be anyone like Ali,"" he said. ""There will be people like Tiger Woods and Michael Jordan who reflect their times, but there will never be someone who means as much to the world and the cultural landscape as much as Ali did.""","Former world heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali celebrates his 70th birthday .

"(CNN) -- First there was friendship. Then there was romance. After that there was marriage. And now, at what would have been a few weeks from her senior year in college, Christian Minard finds herself expelled from school -- because the person she married is another woman. In a letter from earlier this month that Minard shared with CNN, an administrator at Southwestern Christian University noted that he'd been told of Minard's same-sex marriage and saw pictures of it posted to Facebook. Such a union is in apparent conflict with the ""lifestyle covenant"" of the university ""that all students must agree and sign,"" he added. ""As an American and a Christian, I do respect your choice,"" the administrator wrote. ""(But) I have to uphold the Lifestyle Covenant at SCU and confront you with our position. ""Due to this recent event, you will not be able to attend SCU in the future."" When asked to confirm that the school -- which describes itself as part of the ""International Pentecostal Holiness"" denomination -- sent the letter and to elaborate on the decision, the school's provost, Connie Sjoberg, said only that federal law ""prohibits us from confirming if an individual is or has been a student at our institution."" Sjoberg added, ""We therefore cannot comment on your specific request."" Did Minard sign the school's morality covenant? Yes, she concedes. But she still thinks her expulsion is unfair. Plenty of other students violate the contract in one way or another without being expelled, she says. Minard thinks she is singled out because she's a lesbian. In addition to the emotional sting, the 22-year-old says she is now stuck personally -- not knowing what to do, or where to go next. ""I'm trying to figure out how and where I can graduate,"" she told CNN, noting that she'll have to start paying off her loans at the end of next year unless things change. ""... It's going to be hard to get into classes that may be full, because they gave me very little notice before the fall semester starts."" What you need to know about same-sex marriage . Believes 'gay lifestyle' compatible with 'faith in God' Located in the metropolitan Oklahoma City community of Bethany, Southwestern Christian University's website states the school's three core values are scholarship, service and spirit. The latter value includes ""building a Christ-centered community,"" ""honoring our Pentecostal Holiness heritage"" and ""respecting diversity and various Christian backgrounds."" Minard came to the school on scholarship for basketball, though her playing career was cut short after doctors told her -- after she'd suffered multiple concussions -- that she should avoid sports with physical contact. ""I stayed on without a scholarship,"" Minard said, ""because I was so invested in the university and knew that some credits wouldn't transfer to other schools."" Meanwhile, her life was changing in other ways as well. About 3Â½ years ago, she met her future spouse, Kadyn Park. They started out as friends, and romance blossomed over time. ""We eventually fell in love and decided to get married,"" Minard said. The couple wed March 17 in Albuquerque, New Mexico -- a state where same-sex marriage is legal. She had planned to become a strength and conditioning coach. ""Once I graduated,"" Minard said, ""I was willing to go wherever life took me."" Her educational and professional path, though, is now far from clear. Yet Minard feels that she's in the right place in her own spiritual journey. Having grown up in the Lutheran Church, Minard notes that she ""at first ... struggled"" with the idea that her faith was at odds with her sexuality. ""I had questions, but I worked through those questions,"" she said. ""And now I have a strong faith in God. And I believe you can still have faith in God and live a gay lifestyle.""

"Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN) -- Six months after more than 1,000 people lost their lives in the deadliest garment factory accident in Bangladeshi history, the South Asian country continues to mourn the deaths of workers in other avoidable incidents. Earlier this month, at least seven people were killed and dozens injured in a large fire that broke out at a knitwear factory on the outskirts of the capital, Dhaka. While the cause is not immediately known, the owner of the company said in a press briefing that the fire had originated in the chimney of a heating machine. He suggested the way the fire quickly spread through factory was mysterious. As always with these incidents, a committee of government officials and representatives from the garment manufacturers' association convenes to investigate. But ultimately it's never guaranteed that these findings will be made public and corrective measures taken. Aging safety equipment . The knitwear factory, which supplies leading brands across the world, was recently cited for unsatisfactory safety standards, according to local news reports. Though firefighters told reporters the factory was properly equipped to deal with such an incident, Mushrefa Mishu, President of the Garment Workers' Unity Forum, which advocates better treatment for factory employees, said she found out of date firefighting equipment when she visited the site in the wake of the October fire. Opinion: The bloodshed behind our cheap clothes . After the Rana Plaza accident earlier this year, which left 1,129 people dead and more than 2,500 injured when the entire building collapsed, safety standards at garment factories across Bangladesh came under the spotlight amid concerns they had been lax or ignored. The incident was an eye-opener for many. It led to many changes in the garment sector in the months that followed. The country's labor laws were amended with provisions requiring employers to introduce adequate safety measures for workers, while an agreement was signed by the government and representatives of Bangladesh employers' and workers' organizations to ensure a more integrated approach to improving safety. Substandard . Global brands supplied by Bangladeshi factories were also moved to take action to ensure suppliers complied with suitable safety standards. But in June this year, U.S. President Barack Obama said Bangladesh had not been taking steps to ""offer internationally-recognized rights to workers in the country,"" while announcing the suspension of the General System of Preferences (GSP) for Bangladesh. This agreement gave Bangladesh duty-free access to U.S. markets for some items, though garment products were not included. One of the biggest issues is compliance, in part due to the shortage of inspectors in Bangladesh able to cover the vast number of factories spread throughout the country. While steps are being taken to recruit more inspectors, it's impossible to overlook the failures of the government's accountability mechanisms. This has created a culture of impunity among factory owners. The failure of successive governments in Bangladesh, ranked in the bottom tier of the Corruption Perception Index (CPI) of global anti-corruption watchdog Transparency International, to curb wrongdoing in the garment industry has created an environment where disasters will happen. A sector that started to grow quickly in the 1980s, the garment industry has never been accountable to the country's labor laws and regulations. This is because owners are mostly from powerful sections of society who seemingly didn't bother to follow rules. According to one Bangladeshi media report, 10% of lawmakers in the national parliament are owners of garment businesses in Bangladesh. According to Mishu, the number is actually even higher. Rules ignored . The Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) is considered to be one of the most influential trade bodies in the country, with links to all of the major political parties. But such is the dependence of Bangladesh's economy on this industry as its largest export earner, demands to improve working standards and wages are often ignored. Some labor leaders have alleged that during any crisis in the industry, the body takes the side of owners. In the case of the Tazreen fire in November 2012, the role the BGMEA played in protecting the owner raised many eyebrows. The body was criticized for failing to provide a report into the fire, which claimed the lives of more than 100 people. Despite gradual amendments to labor laws, workers' rights are still far from guaranteed. Human Rights Watch, while welcoming efforts to improve the legal framework, expressed concern that international standards for workplace safety are not being met. HRW also said the government ""has consciously limited basic workers' rights while exposing workers to continued risks and exploitation."" Crucially, the provision to punish factory owners in cases of accidents was not properly mentioned in the amended law. Though the law mentioned that ""adequate"" measures have to be taken to ensure air circulation, light, drinkable water and sanitation, the term ""adequate"" is not properly defined, leaving it to the discretion of owners. Many factory owners still arbitrarily sack their employees as they do not give contracts to them, thus making it impossible for the workers to demand compensation at the labor court. Mishu says most workers in the garment sector are women, so their rights and entitlements are grossly ignored. Female workers are also frequently subjected to sexual harassment and often lose their jobs so that they cannot claim maternity benefits. Owners fight back . Factory owners also have their say in this whole saga. Many I have spoken to said that with such a competitive market worldwide, they simply can't give in to the demands of workers. They say persistent corruption and political chaos in Bangladesh has driven up the cost of doing business there. ""The buyers, despite our repeated failures to ensure compliance, come to Bangladesh as they can get the cheapest rate here compared to neighboring countries,"" one owner, who asked not to be identified, said. ""They will keep on coming as long as we offer this rate and we can't afford to lose it by increasing salaries of the workers or ensuring compliance,"" he added. ""This whole industry has grown ... to make profit for both the owners and foreign buyers,"" added Mishu. ""They can't think of the workers as their working partners. The mentality of the colonial era still exists."" With only a few initiatives by the government and no real evidence of the political will to improve safety standards at work, disasters will continue to happen. Measures will keep being promised without effective action. The workers, who keep the economy running, will continue to bare the brunt of injustice and deprivation. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sajjad Hussein.","Hussein: Six months on from Rana Plaza collapse, conditions for workers remain poor .

"(CNN) -- If there's one thing we've learned about the CNN iReport community, it's that you all love to capture celestial events. Thursday's partial solar eclipse was no exception. The eclipse reached its height at 5:45 p.m. ET, NASA said, meaning the eastern half of the country should have gotten a view before the backdrop of golden twilight hues. People living in the Central Time Zone had the best view. As the moon clipped the sun, it appeared like a fingernail. Or, according to iReporter and independent journalist Georgianne Nienaber, like an iconic arcade game character. ""The moon took a little chunk out of the sun, like Pac-Man,"" she said. Neinaber spent her evening in Sanibel Island, Florida, getting the perfect shot of the eclipse. Of course, staring at the sun is never a good idea, even during an eclipse. ""Don't stare,"" NASA urged. ""Even at maximum eclipse, a sliver of sun peeking out from behind the Moon can still cause pain and eye damage. Direct viewing should only be attempted with the aid of a safe solar filter."" Greg Hogan of Kathleen, Georgia, attached his camera to a telescope with a solar filter in order to photograph the show. Hogan, who usually photographs the moon, started experimenting with sun photography this week. The effort was worth it, he said. ""It was epic!""

"NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN) -- The annual State of the Black Union forum boasted a number of famous attendees in New Orleans on Saturday, but this year's event received much more attention for who wasn't there. Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Barack Obama campaigns in New Orleans on February 7. Sen. Hillary Clinton, D-New York, was the only major presidential candidate to accept an invitation to attend. Her rival, Illinois Sen. Barack Obama, declined, as did Republican presidential hopeful Sen. John McCain of Arizona. Clinton told the crowd Saturday evening the country stands at a historic moment. ""How many of our parents and our grandparents, and how many of us ever thought we would see the day when a woman or an African-American would be the Democratic nominee for president of the United States,"" she said. Watch Clinton address the forum » . But Clinton also acknowledged experiencing ""painful moments"" during the campaign, which she called very challenging and incredibly competitive. ""The high stakes and historic nature of Sen. Obama's candidacy and mine have invested this campaign with an intensity and an excitement seldom seen in the political arena,"" she said. Meanwhile, Obama's absence at the forum has prompted both controversy and a backlash against Tavis Smiley, the organizer of the event who has openly criticized Obama's decision. In a letter to Smiley earlier this month, Obama commended the forum for addressing important issues, but explained he needed to focus on his presidential run ahead of the critical March 4 primaries. ""In the final stretch, I will be on the campaign trail every day in states like Ohio, Texas and Wisconsin talking directly with voters about the causes that are at the heart of my campaign and the State of the Black Union forum,"" Obama wrote. ""That is why, with regret, I am not able to attend the forum.""  Watch the candidates stump in Texas » . Smiley has been vocal about his disapproval of Obama's decision. ""I think it's a missed opportunity on Mr. Obama's part,"" Smiley told CNN. ""Now, I am not interested in demonizing him for his choice, but I do disagree with it.""  Watch a report on the controversy » . But Smiley's criticism has also prompted many people to come to Obama's defense. The talk show host told The Washington Post he has been inundated with angry e-mails and even death threats. ""I have family in Indianapolis. They are harassing my momma, harassing my brother. It's getting to be crazy,"" Smiley told the newspaper. Several forum attendees seemed unfazed by Obama's absence Saturday. ""Personally, I don't think it's much of an issue,"" said Victor Reed. ""I'm standing behind him 100 percent."" Clinton probably was at the event because ""she needs it more than [Obama] right now,"" he added. Another State of the Black Union attendee said many people at the forum wished Obama had come, but understood his reasons for declining the invitation. ""It's better for his campaign to be in Texas,"" said Tiffany Washington. Some of the nation's top black activists and politicians attend the State of the Black Union. Smiley said he picked New Orleans as the 2008 host city to highlight the continued plight of its residents in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. ""We owe it to them, those who survived, those who are still struggling to rebuild their lives,"" Smiley said. ""We owe it to them to raise these issues louder than ever."" New Orleans continues to battle problems, including crime and lack of affordable housing. Entire communities still lack hospitals or emergency care. Obama campaigned in the city before he easily won Louisiana's Democratic primary on February 9, taking 57 percent of the vote. In a question-and-answer session with Smiley at the State of the Black Union, Clinton was asked about remarks her husband made while campaigning for his wife in South Carolina, including his reference to Jesse Jackson having won primaries in the state during the 1980s. Critics complained the remarks suggested that Obama's success in that state would largely be based on his race. In her answer, Clinton said many of the forum attendees knew her husband personally and knew his heart. ""If anyone was offended by anything that was said, whether it was meant or not, whether it was misinterpreted or not, then obviously I regret that. But I believe our task is to go forward with the agenda that all of us agree upon. That is what I have done my entire life, on behalf of civil rights and women's rights and human rights,"" Clinton said. ""I believe strongly that there is a shared and common purpose that we all hold very dear, regardless of who you are supporting at this time for the Democratic nominee as president,"" she added. ""It goes way beyond Barack and me. It goes way beyond politics. And I don't think there is any doubt that I and Bill have been part of that common purpose and that struggle our entire adult lives."" At least one Louisiana lawmaker praised Clinton for being there when the region needed help. ""I don't support people just because they are black,"" said Democratic state Rep. Juan LaFonta. ""I support people because they are qualified and committed to issues that affect my constituent base."" E-mail to a friend .","Sen.

"(CNN) -- The sole set of criminal charges to come from the fake classes scandal at the University of North Carolina might soon be dropped. Orange County District Attorney Jim Woodall told CNN that he's thinking about withdrawing fraud charges against ex-UNC professor Julius Nyang'oro. Nyang'oro was indicted in December after a grand jury found he was paid to teach so-called paper classes, which didn't require students to attend but instead just write a single paper. The scandal has drawn national attention since the NCAA has declined to punish the university, even though many of the classes were attended by athletes. Whistleblower and former reading specialist Mary Willingham, along with former athletes, have also publicly said there was systematic cheating in the classes and that the Athletic Department used the paper classes to keep athletes eligible when they would have otherwise failed. But UNC has continuously denied that any administrators, except for Nyang'oro and his assistant, were aware of what was happening. Woodall said his decision was based on great cooperation from Nyang'oro in the criminal investigation and the latest UNC-commissioned inquiry, this one being conducted by former Homeland Security adviser Ken Wainstein. Woodall said he thinks it is better for the community to have Nyang'oro's cooperation -- to understand why, how and when the paper classes began and who had knowledge of them -- than to have a criminal prosecution move forward. In either case, Woodall said, Nyang'oro is likely eligible for a diversionary program that would eventually lead to the charges being dismissed. ""Even though it's a noncriminal investigation, that is more important than this,"" Woodall said, referring to Wainstein's review. ""The money is paid back already,"" Woodall said. ""This was more of an academic scandal than any kind of criminal issue. ... In the criminal probe, what we're left with is one low-level nonviolent felony for a person never in trouble before in his life."" That said, nothing has been decided. Woodall is simply considering it. Neither Nyang'oro or his attorney responded to CNN's requests for comment. Last week, during a UNC board meeting, Wainstein gave an update, and referenced the cooperation from both Nyang'oro and his assistant, Debbie Crowder. Woodall announced he declined to charge Crowder when she began cooperating. Wainstein told the board that his team had been briefed by the criminal investigators and that Crowder and Nyang'oro were interviewed, ""thanks in large part to the efforts and assistance of Orange County District Attorney James Woodall Jr."" Wainstein also said that his team has collected and searched 1.5 million e-mails and documents from more than 30 people, including faculty, athletic administrators at UNC. They are also analyzing student transcripts going back to the 1980s and have gotten ""extremely valuable"" information from people who have reached out. Woodall said he believes Nyang'oro's cooperation is imperative. ""It may be impossible to get to the bottom because this was going on for years and years, but the only opportunity to get a full picture -- they had to interview Julius Nyang'oro, and he was willing to do that."" Willingham said that there are several administrators in academics and athletics who openly talked about the paper classes and about putting athletes into the classes when they needed a boost to their grade point average.","District Attorney Jim Woodall said he's thinking about withdrawing fraud charges .

"(CNN) -- At full speed, the Rimac Concept_One is little more than a cherry red blur, flashing from one corner of the horizon to the other in the blink of an eye. If its projected performance figures prove to be true, this radical electric concept car -- the brainchild of an award-winning young Croatian designer -- could accelerate faster than all but two of the fastest supercars on earth. The Rimac Concept_One's figures are impressive. Not just for an electric car, but for traditional petrol-engine cars as well. For years electric vehicles have been regarded as the frumpy inner-city siblings of their hardier countryside 4x4 brethren or zippier track-friendly supercar sisters. Electric vehicles have tended to have names like Leaf, Buddy or Spark as opposed to Vanquish, Venom or Phantom. All this may be set to change when Rimac goes into production. First unveiled at Frankfurt Motor Show in September, 2011, the Concept One is an electric vehicle that aims to be even faster than the Bugatti Veyron. Its precocious 25-year-old inventor, Mate Rimac, says that the car produces 1018 horsepower, can accelerate from 0 to 100 kph (62 mph) in just 2.8 seconds, has a top speed of 305 kph (190 mph), and can travel 600 kilometers (372 miles) on a single charge. Mate Rimac says that he has always been motivated by the desire to demonstrate the superiority of electric over petrol-powered cars: ""I have two passions; cars and technology,"" Rimac says. ""Technology because Nikola Tesla was born in Croatia, and he invented the electric motor that is used in so many applications today. And I knew simply by theory that this motor is so much better to drive a car -- even a sports car. ""I decided to combine my two passions, technology and cars and make an electric car that can prove the electric motor is much better even on the racetrack. Not just city cars for boring stuff, but to show people that the future will be interesting -- that one day when petrol is gone and you only have electric cars in the world, you won't have to compromise in terms of performance, speed or (how) far (it can go)."" While he was still in high school, Rimac bought a lime green BMW for less than â‚¬1000 and began modifying it with new parts. ""I couldn't wait to pull out (the motor) and put batteries and electric motors inside instead of the gas engine,"" Rimac says. After several years of rebuilding and alteration, Rimac set a world record with his car, which became the fastest accelerating electric car in the world. The car is still recognized in the Guinness Book of World Records for the fastest quarter mile by an electric vehicle. After setting five separate world records with his modified BMW, Rimac began to work towards building his very own car from scratch. He enlisted the help of the highly-regarded young car designer Adriano Mudri, and began work on the Concept_One. Now Rimac is turning his dream car into a reality on a shoestring budget: ""In the car industry, it's common to design a new car with 1 billion to 5 billion dollars. But, most of those cars carry over components from previous versions -- engines, gear boxes and stuff. We had to design a car (including) the whole technology under the skin, (while) the company itself didn't have a desk to put a computer on. And we did all that with less than 0.1% of the budget which is usual in the car industry,"" Rimac says. Preliminary impressions from the automotive press have been generally positive, although many, such as GTspirit.com, said that they approached the concept of a vehicle that has ""no sound, no downshift and no smell of burnt petrol"" with trepidation. Some also disputed the figures Rimac has released, suggesting that their projected performance statistics may be ambitious. Still, the notion that an electric car might soon not just match, but outperform the best petrol vehicles on the planet is certainly a captivating one. When Rimac releases a production car into the wild in the not-too-distant future, the eyes of the world will certainly be watching.","The Rimac Concept_One is an electric-powered supercar .

"(CNN) -- Ukraine's imprisoned opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko accuses the country's president of running a ""mafia"" government in a video smuggled out of her prison by her lawyer, the lawyer told CNN Sunday. The video, shot on lawyer Sergiy Vlasenko's cell phone, is the first time Tymoshenko has been seen since December of last year. It shows a clearly agitated Tymoshenko berating the government as a prison guard tries to put his hand over the lens of the lawyer's cell phone. ""Today, unfortunately, the whole country lives under a criminal authority,"" Tymoshenko says in the two-minute clip posted on YouTube and her own website. ""Every person can feel that the law is being trampled, that people are completely destitute. And here I feel all this on my own fate, my own life,"" she says. She goes on to attack President Viktor Yanukovych ahead of parliamentary elections due on October 28. ""Everything that is written in the laws regarding human rights means nothing to Yanukovych's mafia. The only things that mean anything to them are enrichment, corruption and everything else that they made for themselves in Ukraine,"" she charges. The video was filmed on Friday in a hospital in Kharkiv, Vlasenko said. ""I was in the corridor and just had the chance to take it with my mobile phone,"" he told CNN. ""It is the first video made of her this year. Yanukovych is trying to limit her contact with the outside world. All other inmates in Ukraine are allowed phone calls to their family members, but Yulia Tymoshenko is severely restricted."" The last video of the opposition leader showed her bed-ridden in Kharkiv prison during a hunger strike in December 2011. The former prime minister was found guilty in October 2011 of criminally ""abusing her office"" over a 2009 gas deal with Gazprom, in what the United States and European Union have both called a politically motivated show trial. Russian President Vladimir Putin also criticized the sentence handed down to the former leader of Ukraine's short-lived pro-democracy Orange Revolution. She is barred by her sentence from running in the parliamentary elections next month. After the video surfaced on Friday, the Ukrainian Prison Service quickly posted their own video of the country's former leader. Posted on its official YouTube site, the video shows her beating the inside of a cell with her shoe and her fists. In the video Tymoshenko seems frail and only able to stand with the assistance of a medical supportive chair. At the United Nations General Assemby in New York last week, President Viktor Yanukovych did not make any mention of Tymoshenko's imprisonment. The Ukrainian government did not immediately respond Sunday to CNN requests for comment.","The smuggled cell phone video is the first time Yulia Tymoshenko has been seen since December .

"(CNN) -- When Barack Obama is sworn in as the 44th president of the United States, the wish list that has been building abroad may have grown longer than he or anyone else can deliver. The world's newspapers marked Barack Obama's election win. Now, world governments want him to act. There are the apparently eternal conflicts of the Middle East and Kashmir, between India and Pakistan, that have already reared their ugly heads almost as a warning even before Obama took office. Between them, they engulf most of the grievances and violence that shape the Islamic world and its relations with the United States. Intense U.S. involvement will be needed to help resolve both of the conflicts. This will require imagination, creative out-of-the-box diplomacy, and the courage to see it through both from the United States and leaders on the ground. Going back even to the status-quo ante will no longer be sufficient. The 30-year-old rupture in relations between the United States and Iran is also expected to be addressed as a key priority by the new administration. Both the president-elect and his secretary of state-designate have said they want to abandon the silent treatment and isolation of previous administrations and try engaging Iran, as a way of resolving difficult issues such as its nuclear program and its influence in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Watch Amanpour talk about world views of Obama » . The United States remains bogged down in hot wars in both of those countries. While the Obama administration plans to increase troops and nation-building in Afghanistan, it is also signaling it will not give President Hamid Karzai's government the ""free ride"" he is thought to have received from the Bush administration. Karzai will be expected to root out corruption and better address the needs of the Afghan people. The new administration will also try to revive nuclear arms agreements that have been abandoned over the last eight years and try to forge a more constructive relationship with Russia, while persuading that country to meet its international obligations too. While many allies -- and adversaries -- welcome the new U.S. administration's declaration to use diplomacy and soft power, the question remains: Will Washington's allies also pull their weight in helping set their common agenda? Many nations and governments say they welcome America's vital global leadership, and the question at the start of the Obama administration is: Will they rise robustly to the occasion, and not just carp from the sidelines? While much is expected from Obama, much, too, will be expected from his allies.","World has long wish list for Barack Obama when he becomes president .

Canning's parents, Sean and Elizabeth, argue that she was not kicked out of the house. Instead, they say she left on her own back in October because she didn't want to abide by their rules. Mixed into this seemingly dysfunctional family brew are a number of other allegations against each side: that the Cannings didn't like Rachel's boyfriend and that they were abusive to her, and that Rachel missed curfews and was suspended from school. No surprise that reaction in social media was swift and significantly tilted in one direction. ""She is an entitled spoiled brat and will regret this later in life,"" wrote G.G. Benitez, CEO and founder of a public relations firm, on my Facebook page. Tish Howard, a former elementary school principal and CEO of an educational consulting firm, agreed. ""Here is another example of what happens when children are over entitled. Let's hand out more trophies for just showing up,"" Howard, a mother and grandmother, wrote on Facebook. Kim Kennedy, a New York-based television producer, said,""Bratty kids have always been there. Some have better publicists."" But there was a little bit of blame for the parents too. ""Her parents have clearly contributed to the development of her character and work ethic (or lack thereof),"" wrote Pamela Sellers, a freelance producer and writer and mom of two girls in Atlanta. ""They should settle this by ensuring that she complete her high school degree. As for college: until she learns to appreciate what she's had, she will never be respectful. They should cut her off completely. Her learning to make it on her own will be the best thing in the end."" Howard, the former school principal, said she feels ""deep compassion"" for the parents. ""I am saddened that someone in their life was not brave enough to have a critical conversation with them years ago about disabling children with an easy easy path,"" she said. ""Self esteem and accountability are by products of overcoming disequilibrium and succeeding not by having adults eliminate the hurdles and failures for you."" Dorothy Liu, an entrepreneur and mom in Bellevue, Washington, said if the parents' side of the story is true, it sounds as though they were ""at the end of their rope."" ""As parents, most of us try to do the best we can and hope we can instill enough good common sense and humility in our kids so they may make good decisions,"" said Liu, who has a 10-year-old daughter. ""It saddens me to see the level of entitlement in this generation, but it's more evidence that by giving our kids every opportunity to realize their potential, we're also giving them the power to see it as their due rather than the gift and privilege it is."" On the other side are people like Sheryl Resnick of Tucson, Arizona, who believes the appropriateness of suing parents really depends on the individual child's circumstances . ""I know of a situation where a 12-year-old was taken out of private school and had to go to public school in a different city,"" said Resnick, also on Facebook. ""His parents drank up his school money. But in those days a kid didn't sue his parents. He pitied them. But it did irrevocably change his life."" Perhaps the view that sums up this entire case was a tweet with the hashtag #Nowinners by a father of two boys. He called it a ""terrible situation."" Indeed it is, because whatever happens, you have a relationship between a child and her parents that is anything but healthy at the moment. Raising a teenager isn't easy. At the same time, being a teenager is no walk in the park either. If only both sides could find a way to meet in the therapist's office -- together -- that would be a step in the right direction, said Jennifer Hartstein, a New York City-based child, adolescent and family psychologist. ""Clearly, there is a breakdown in communication in this family, bordering on limited communication,"" said Hartstein. ""The real question I have is how did it get so bad and go this far? What kind of steps could have been taken prior to this happening?""","A New Jersey teen sues her parents to pay her college costs .

"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (CNN) -- Many have pointed to lessons learned -- and heeded -- from the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. Should there be tighter rules about who's in the cockpit? That's happened. Should the Malaysian military have acted more quickly after the airliner went missing nearly four weeks ago? They've launched an investigation. Are there better ways to track commercial aircraft -- especially when, as in this case, its transponder is turned off? An international aviation organization says it will consider ""all of the options."" But as much as things might change because of this mystery, it doesn't change the fact that -- for yet another day -- there are 239 families still grieving, still waiting, still venting over authorities' inability to answer what happened to the Boeing 777. ""We want to provide comfort to the families and we will not rest until answers are indeed found,"" Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said Thursday during a visit to a military base near the Australian city of Perth, which has become the hub for search operations. Mystery of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 surfaces pain of 1977 tragedy . Yes, authorities have said communications mysteriously, and seemingly purposefully, cut off shortly into the Beijing-bound flight. Yes, satellite data suggests the aircraft turned back over Malaysia before terminating somewhere in the vast southern Indian Ocean. Yet there have been no solid leads about why any of this happened or where the plane ended up. In fact, officials don't seem to know all that much more on Day 27 after it disappeared sometime after leaving Kuala Lumpur than they did on Day 1. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott on Thursday described the search for the plane as ""the most difficult in human history"" and warned there was no guarantee it would be found. ""We cannot be certain of ultimate success in the search for MH370,"" he said at a news briefing in Perth, standing alongside Najib. ""But we can be certain that we will spare no effort -- that we will not rest -- until we have done everything we humanly can."" All 227 passengers have been cleared of any role in hijacking or sabotage or having psychological or personal issues that might have played a role in the plane's disappearance, the inspector general of Malaysian police, Khalid Abu Bakar, told reporters Wednesday. Police said Wednesday a review of a flight simulator found in a pilot's house proved inconclusive. And senior Malaysian government officials told CNN last week that authorities have found nothing about either of the pilots to suggest a motive. There have been no such public comments about the other 10 crew members, however. ""We don't have enough evidence to take (hijacking, sabotage or many other possibilities) off the table,"" Michael Kay, a former British pilot and military officer, told CNN. ""What we need to do is keep an open mind, look at the facts, and keep building the jigsaw puzzle. Because that's all we have at the moment."" On Thursday, up to eight aircraft will set out looking for telltale debris across an 91,500 square-mile (237,000 square-kilometer) zone, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority says. Up to nine ships will search, including one British submarine racing against time to hear the signature pinging from Flight 370's flight data recorder. There could be a breakthrough imminently; a seat cushion, a soda can, a life jacket could be spotted and scooped up, leading to the rest of the plane and, ultimately, to explain what happened. So far, though, nothing has been found. In fact, it might be someone dipping her toes off a beach in Australia or Thailand or Malaysia who first notices something. ""We'll keep going til hell freezes over,"" Kim Beazley, Australia's former defense minister and current ambassador to the United States, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. ""It could take months, it could take years."" Official pleads for patience . Last Friday, officials announced that -- based on new analysis of satellite data -- they'd shifted the search area significantly closer to Australia's northwest coast. It moved again from Tuesday to Wednesday, albeit not as extensively. On Thursday, it moved again, a little farther north. Why? Beazley explained it's because ""we're eliminating areas from our inquiry"" and moving to adjacent areas. Yet David Soucie, a CNN safety analyst and author of ""Why Planes Crash,"" said ""from the outside looking in, it just doesn't seem to make a lot of sense."" ""It just looks like they're following information and data that they're not confident in,"" Soucie said. Authorities have been upfront about many things they don't know about Flight 370 -- things like altitude, speed and direction that are key to pinpointing its final resting place. Then there are questions about who and what was aboard. While the passengers were cleared, investigators are still questioning relatives of all of those on the plane -- having already interviewed about 170 people -- as well as those who may have had access to it. That includes scrutinizing those who prepared food for the flight, those who packed the cargo, and those who were to receive the cargo in China. ""Everything from beginning to end,"" said Khalid, the Malaysian police official. Police are considering four criminal possibilities: hijacking, sabotage, personal problems and psychological issues, though mechanical failure hasn't been ruled out. Khalid stressed getting answers won't be easy, nor will it be quick. ""We have to clear every little thing,"" said Khalid. ""You cannot hurry us in whatever we are doing."" 'We cannot let another aircraft simply disappear' Even without anything definitive, Malaysia Airlines has taken proactive steps to beef up cockpit security, two sources familiar with the airline's operations told CNN on Wednesday. A new directive says no pilot or first officer is allowed to sit alone in the cockpit. Whenever one of them is outside the cockpit, a senior cabin steward must remain inside. ""These changes are positive in nature and directly relate to the MH370 incident,"" one of the sources told CNN. This policy isn't new everywhere: It's long been in place for the United States, experts note. ""What they put in place is pretty common sense,"" said Mary Schiavo, a CNN aviation analyst and former inspector general for the U.S. Department of Transportation. Other reforms could be coming as well, and not just affecting Malaysia Airlines. Tony Tyler, director general and CEO of the International Air Transport Association, in a recent speech pointed to ""disbelief both that an aircraft could simply disappear and that the 'black box' is so difficult to recover."" He added, ""We cannot let another aircraft simply disappear."" Toward that end, the association will form a task force that will include participation by the International Civil Aviation Organization to ""examine all of the options available for tracking commercial aircraft"" and then to report its conclusions by December. A second lesson concerns security, Tyler said, citing the fact two passengers with phony passports were able to board the missing jetliner unchallenged. Though these two men have since been cleared, the incident underscores a need for governments to do better checking passenger lists, he said. ""Airlines are neither border guards nor policemen; that is the well-established responsibility of governments."" Family members still have questions . Such changes are all well and good. But they won't bring back the scores thought to have perished on Flight 370. On Wednesday, families of 18 Chinese passengers -- out of 154 Chinese aboard -- met privately in Kuala Lumpur for three hours with Malaysian government officials and investigators. The meeting had been called after they accused Malaysia of not being upfront about the investigation. Families of newlyweds still waiting . Azharuddin Abdul Rahman, head of Malaysia's civil aviation department, said it was ""a very good meeting."" ""We answered all their questions."" The families' representative saw it differently. ""I personally believe today's meeting had some progress, but the time was short and family members didn't have an opportunity to raise questions,"" said Jiang Hui. Questions, questions, questions. There's no shortage of them. Chief among them is will the flight data recorder be found before batteries on its locator beacon die -- which, according to its design standards, would happen April 7. Experts agree that it won't be easy, given all the unknowns. ""They are looking in a vast area in very deep waters ... and we really have no idea where it went in,"" said Bill Schofield, an Australian scientist who helped create the flight data recorders that, if found, could prove key to the investigation. ""A needle in a haystack would be much easier to find."" 6 missteps in the investigation . Ocean Shield: A mission of hope in search for Flight 370 . Flight 370: High-tech search tools . CNN's Greg Botelho and Tom Watkins reported and wrote from Atlanta; Judy Kwon and Jim Clancy reported from Kuala Lumpur; CNN's Holly Yan, Sara Sidner, Shimon Prokupecz, David Fitzpatrick, Barbara Starr, Will Ripley, Richard Quest, Nic Robertson, Mitra Mobasherat, Kyung Lah, Jethro Mullen and Yuli Yang also contributed to this report.","NEW: The search is ""the most difficult in human history,"" Australia's Abbott says .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. could be in for another quiet hurricane season, according to Phillip Klotzbach and William Gray of Colorado State University. Their annual preseason forecast, released Thursday, predicted nine named storms and three hurricanes, one of them major (category 3 or higher). That's well below the Atlantic basin average of 12 named storms, six hurricanes and three major hurricanes. They attribute the below-normal prediction to cooler than average water in the Atlantic Ocean and a likelihood of a moderate El Nino developing in late summer or fall. ""The tropical Atlantic has anomalously cooled over the past several months, and the chances of a moderate to strong El Nino event this summer and fall appear to be quite high,"" Klotzbach said. ""Historical data indicate fewer storms form in these conditions."" Last year's forecast was for 18 named storms, nine hurricanes and four major hurricanes. However, there were only 14 named storms and two hurricanes, neither of them major. 2012 and 2014 were the only two years in the past decade in which Gray has gone with a below-normal season in his preseason report. He forecast 10 named storms in 2012. That year ended up being tied for the third most named storms on record, with 19. This year's report also includes the probability of major hurricanes making landfall on U.S. soil: . • 35% for the entire U.S. coastline (average for the past century is 52%) • 20% for the U.S. East Coast, including the Florida peninsula (average for the past century is 31%) • 19% for the Gulf Coast from the Florida Panhandle west to Brownsville, Texas (average for the past century is 30%) • 28% for the Caribbean (average for the past century is 42%)","Experts predict nine named storms, three hurricanes, one major hurricane .

"(CNN) -- Though he told authorities that the devil made him do it, Satanists disapproved, after a man allegedly shattered a stone copy of the Ten Commandments last week. The man is accused of running his car on Friday into a controversial 6-foot-tall granite tablet of the biblical edicts erected near Oklahoma City's Capitol, CNN affiliate KFOR reported. He then left his car standing near the monument, which -- as photos showed -- was smashed asunder through the second commandment: ""Thou shalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain."" He walked into the Federal Building, where he made threats against President Obama and the federal government, KFOR reported, citing U.S. Secret Service agents. The man told the agents that the devil made him wreck the religious monument, which was placed at the Capitol in late 2012. He also said he was mentally ill and had stopped taking his medication. He has been detained at a mental health facility for evaluation. Condemnation of the destruction came quickly from two sources that have railed against the monument -- the ACLU of Oklahoma and the Satanic Temple. The ACLU filed suit last year against the presence of the monument on state property, and on Friday, said that it would keep fighting for its removal, because it feels it violates the Constitution. But the organization was also ""outraged at this apparent act of vandalism."" ""The Ten Commandments constitute a strong foundation in our clients' deeply held religious beliefs,"" the Oklahoma ACLU said in a statement. The Satanic Temple has demanded to have a monument of its own erected next to the Judeo-Christian one. And it still wants it, but ""only alongside the 10 Commandments,"" it said in a statement posted by KFOR. ""If our monument stands at the state Capitol, we want it to complement and contrast the Ten Commandments, with both standing unmolested as a testament to American religious freedom and tolerance."" The Satanists could well have that wish fulfilled, but only in part. Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin has vowed to have the Ten Commandments monument rebuilt. .","A man allegedly rams his car into a Ten Commandments monument .

"(Parenting.com) -- It wasn't until soccer referee Ricardo Portillo died that I started to really think about what happened there, and not just because I grew up on the field myself. Like Portillo, my father was a volunteer referee. He was my coach for years in the town league. When I grew up and moved on, he missed those days of camaraderie and competition. He missed supporting kids and being a part of their development, teaching them to love the game, to deal appropriately with the highs and the lows. So, when I no longer provided even a sideline to invest in, he volunteered. I was happy he was getting involved. He knew the game, and kids, so well by then. I cannot imagine it being the death of him like it was for Portillo who died Saturday night, a week after a punch from a 17-year-old player put him in a coma in the Salt Lake City suburb of Taylorsville. Portillo was issuing a yellow card -- a warning card, not an expulsion card - against the player who had been arguing with him. That player punched him in the side of the head, causing serious injury. While the cause of death has yet to be officially confirmed, Portillo never woke up from the resulting coma. The secret risk of youth sports . I've been in adult coed games where I feared for somebody's well being off the field. It was scary (and annoying, quite frankly, because it disrupted play while we all sat around watching someone get calmed down). But, as a lifetime athlete, I'm also kind of familiar with that aggression, granted on a much smaller scale, and I see the seeds of it in my children. If genetics are anything, my husband and I have blessed our daughters with natural athletic ability and cursed them with an unnatural intensity and self-criticism. My husband threw racquets. I hyperventilated and sulked and once even stomped off a field yelling obscenities at my coach. We watch our older daughter, Avina, who is 3 1/2, and joke about how she's doomed to be like us, but really, we're both concerned. Like any kid, Avina wants us to watch every chassÃ©, every somersault, and if she can't do something, she almost immediately yells ""I can't do it!"" then throws whatever's in her hand and marches off. So young, and already her above average coordination is mixing poorly with a need for perfection. 5 anger management tips for children . That's what Dr. Patrick Cohn, a youth sports psychologist in Orlando and founder of youthsportspsychology.com, calls it -- perfectionism. It's that self-criticism so common to athletes that can intensify in the teen years, because, well, they're adolescents. ""Perfectionists have a difficult time with making mistakes,"" Cohn said, when asked how to cultivate resilience on the sports field. ""We help these athletes manage their high expectations about performance and to react better to mistakes. ""Many children link their self-esteem with their performance. If they perform badly, their self-esteem suffers. It's important for parents to help their kids separate their self-worth from achievement in sports."" Cohn specializes in how mental attitudes shape performance and works with professional teams, athletes, parents, even corporations, on how to develop that attitude. How to prevent sports injuries in kids . Not only is this strength, this ability to cope with adversity, with challenge, an excellent life skill, it's also, as we see more and more these days, about safety. A competitive sport inherently involves some aggression; how do we know when a kid is crossing a line? How do we prevent or police the transition from competitive to dangerously aggressive? ""Sports itself requires athletes to assert themselves against an opponent, such as to obtain possession of a soccer ball or basketball,"" Cohn said. ""But athletes cross the line between assertive behavior and aggressive behavior when they break the rules in sports or intentionally try to harm other athletes, coaches, or referees."" And this is more likely to happen when athletes become frustrated or angry. So, if we teach them to deal with frustration and anger, we can help prevent violence, of any scale, on the field. My outbursts were minimal when I was younger, when my father was an active part of my game experience. He was known for how level headed and fair he was. And this rubbed off on all of us. Granted, later, when I became more independent and my parents were less involved, my temper flared. Maybe I was missing other role models. I'm sure I was tying my self-worth to my game. Certainly, when I had a supportive coach, I acted out less. Parents are key to cultivating this capability, but, Cohn says, everybody is responsible for modeling as well as actively making a healthy attitude happen -- parents, coaches, even the leagues, which should set up bylaws, outlining acceptable behavior, and then enforce those rules. ""And the parents can't be afraid to report bullying or bad behavior. Athletes, as well, should look out for their teammates,"" Cohn notes. Why I told my daughter she sucks at sports . According to his daughter, Johana Portillo, her father was a ref because he was passionate about the game. ""He loved soccer,"" she told CNN. ""We just never thought this was going to happen. He loved what he did and it was his passion."" As an adult, when I was somehow completely free of social and personal pressure, I would often sit in my car after a soccer game, removing my muddy cleats, reflecting on how truly joyous it is to play just for the love of it. I want my children to feel that from the start, free from violent disruptions, both internal and external. Because there is no role model more powerful than a parent, and no better way to take back our ball fields than raising kids with composure, here are more tools for parents on how to raise real athletes, on and off the field. Tools for Parents . Dr. Cohn created a pre- and post-game checklist to help parents encourage balance and positivity in their child's athletic experience. Some of the to-dos will be more challenging than others. In general, the message is: stay positive, calm, neutral, and leave the game on the field. This will help your child keep his sense of self-worth separate from performance and help him trust his coach and the officials. 5 Pre-game To-Dos . 1. Help your child or teen feel confident about today's game or competition. If you discuss the game, remember to be positive about your athlete's past experiences and successes. Don't point out mistakes or losses. Stay away from the subject of avoiding mistakes from previous games. Say, ""Have fun! I know you'll do your best!"" 2. Leave the coaching to the coach. Show that you support the coach's decisions. Don't talk about how you'd like the coach to manage the team or how you disagree with some of his decisions. This will undermine your athletes' confidence and trust. They need to enter the game trusting their coaches. 3. Keep your emotions in check. Be a good role model for composure. If you show that you're jittery, nervous, or worried about the game or competition, your child or teen will likely be affected by these feelings. 4. Be a good fan. Be composed on the sidelines before the game. Demonstrate your trust in the coach, the players, and the referees. Don't express your feelings about who should play, or how the coach should play the kids, or how you view a particular ref. Be only positive and supportive. Find ways to support the teamâ€”by bringing water or snacks, for example, or serving as scorekeeper if the team needs a parent to do this. 5. Avoid prolonged discussions about your athlete's technique or mechanics before the game. Practice time is over. Just before a game, athletes need to believe in what they've learned and trust in their abilities. If you focus too much on mechanics and technique, they may freeze up. It may be difficult for them to play freely and with trust in their abilities. Avoid saying things like, ""Remember the Square Drill and be sure to kick with the side of your foot instead of your toe."" Say instead, ""Go for it! Have a blast."" 5 Post-Game To-Dos . 1. Start by making two positive comments about your son or daughter's game. Pick out two simple areas you can complement your son or daughter about. For example, ""You really hit the ball great off the tee today and made a great comeback after a slow start."" You are more likely to get your player's attention by starting with a couple of positive comments. 2. Ask your player, ""What are two things you did well today?"" Discuss these first no matter how well or poorly your child played. 3. Be mindful of the subtle rewards or punishment you may unknowingly or knowingly give your player after the game. For example, showing excitement and enthusiasm (for good play) is a reward for your child. Withdrawing attention or being silent (after a bad performance) is a form of punishment for your child. 4. Avoid dwelling on numbers, scores, or position in the event after the game or performance. Discuss statistics only if necessary to make a point. Perfectionists are too obsessed about statistics already, which does not help them maintain a process focus during performance. 5. Leave sports on the playing field! Avoid discussing the game at home and help your child shift gears into other roles in life. Do not go over the play by play unless your child asks. Focus on developing balance in life rather than being 24/7 sports. Get 2 FREE YEARS of Parenting magazine - Subscribe Now!! Copyright 2011 The Parenting Group. All rights reserved.

"(CNN) -- When the news flashed last week that a man had shot and killed a Canadian soldier in front of the National War Memorial in Canada, what most people were wondering -- but not saying out loud -- was, ""Is it another radical Muslim?"" And it was. As was Martin Rouleau Couture, the man who ran over two Canadian soldiers in Quebec. As was Zale Thompson, who attacked four police officers in Queens, New York, also last week. It's why I have said before -- we have to be honest, there is a problem in the world of Islam today. Some people have found in it an ideology of opposition and violence against the modern and Western world. The three jihadis who burst onto the news last week represent that ugly phenomenon. But let's dip deeper into these three people to understand what moved them to become terrorists. None of them was born and brought up a religious Muslim. A profile of Michael Zehaf-Bibeau in The New York Times suggests someone who went from a life of partying as a 16-year-old to repeated arrests for drug possession and stealing a credit card. He was once sentenced to prison for two years for possessing a weapon in a robbery. In the Times article, one of the counselors at a Salvation Army shelter described his battles with addiction thus: ""He was doing heroin to take the edge off crack."" Amidst this turmoil, the Times says, he converted to Islam, got radicalized, sought to go to Syria to fight in the jihad and finally ended up trying to wage his own version of it in Ottawa and died after killing a soldier. The man who ran over the soldiers in Canada last week reportedly converted to Islam only a year ago. The New York Police Department says the man who attacked its officers with a hatchet, also clearly disturbed, converted to Islam two years ago. These are not people steeped in Islam -- people for whom the religion has shaped their worldview over decades, people who were motivated by their immersion in the religion. On the contrary, these were unstable young men, prone toward radicalism and violence. They were searching for an ideology that would fit their disturbed worldview, and in the radical and jihadi interpretations of Islam, they found it. It is always worth remembering that these people represent a tiny minority. After all, think of it this way: Terror groups such as Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and al Qaeda have been calling on Muslims to engage in terrorism in Western cities for over 10 years now. But of the some 1.6 billion Muslims worldwide, the number who have responded to these calls is a small, small, small percentage. If all Muslims were radicals, we would have more than three to worry about last week. And yet, there is a problem within Islam. It is not enough for Muslims to point out that these people do not represent the religion. They don't. But Muslims need to take more active measures to protest these heinous acts. They also need to make sure that Muslim countries and societies do not in any way condone extremism, anti-modern attitudes and intolerance towards other faiths. Muslims are right to complain that there is anti-Muslim bigotry out there. But they would have a more persuasive case if they took on some of the bigotry within the world of Islam as well.","We have to be honest -- there is a problem in the world of Islam today, says Fareed Zakaria .
Those involved in attacks last week are not people steeped in Islam, Zakaria says .
Muslims must take on some of the bigotry within the world of Islam as well, he says ."
"(CNN) -- It's an ""epic"" first, ushering in ""one of the most incredible sports stories"" of our time. The result of a storied brotherly rivalry. Leading up to Super Bowl Sunday, some sports columnists and football aficionados are having a field day with the ""Harbowl."" John Harbaugh, coach of the Baltimore Ravens, will face off against his 15-months-younger brother Jim, head coach of the San Francisco 49ers. Top 20 sibling rivalries in sports . Some football fans are complaining that the storyline is overhyped. And the brothers themselves reject it, emphasizing their bond. Still, the super siblings will make history when their teams duke it out this weekend at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans. People all over the world love a good story of a brotherly feud, whether fictional or real. We decided to take a look at some of the biggest ones. The Bible . Cain and Abel. Jacob and Esau. Joseph and his brothers. Moses and Pharoah (they grew up together). Not to mention Isaac and Ishmael. If you're looking for brother vs. brother rivalry, no better jumping off point than the Old Testament. Thor vs. Loki . Comics and cartoons are home to numerous good vs. evil battles represented by two archetypal brothers. See the Lion King's Mufasa vs. Scar. Or the story at the core of last year's record-breaking blockbuster ""The Avengers,"" based on Marvel comics. Loki, Thor's evil adopted brother, tries to terrorize all of humanity. J.R. vs. Bobby . Sometimes you just loving watching the bad guy. On ""Dallas,"" conniving J.R. Ewing was forever squaring off against his good-guy brother Bobby. The show's been resurrected with that battle at the center. But with Larry Hagman's death, J.R. vs. Bobby -- probably the biggest brother vs. brother rivalry in TV history -- will likely end as well, after the episodes Hagman already shot for the new season that began this week. (Coincidental corporate synergy alert: The new ""Dallas"" is airing on TNT, which, like CNN, is a part of Time Warner.) When brothers disband . Brotherly feuds have poisoned the waters for successful musical acts, including the Everly Brothers, which Rolling Stone calls ""Rock's First Sibling Rivalry."" And more recently, similar bitterness helped bust the popular band Oasis. Liam and Noel Gallagher's feud included public spats and legal action. (See also The Kinks, the Isley Brothers and more in this spread from zencollegelife.com.) Battle of the billionaires . Who doesn't hate feuding with their billionaire sibling over the future of a massive empire? So we can all commiserate with Mukesh and Anil Ambani, who split up their father's Reliance Group and have fought to see whose vision for the future of Indian business will prevail. Brotherly love trumps competition . I'll never forget watching the 1984 Olympics as a kid. Twin brothers Phil and Steve Mahre won gold and silver in the slalom at Sarjevo. After Phil finished his race, he used a walkie-talkie to give hints to his brother. I remember thinking, he wants his brother to do well more than he wants to be able to say he beat him. So, while rivalries abound, brotherly love can win out. Sisterly feuds just as strong . We could of course double this list by looking at rivalries between sisters as well. A big one that's been in the news lately: Pauline Phillips, advice columnist behind ""Dear Abby,"" passed away last month. Her twin sister was the equally famous advice columnist Esther ""Eppie"" Pauline Friedman Lederer known as ""Ann Landers."" They were locked in a feud for years.

"(CNN) -- The recent scandal in the Department of Veterans Affairs sheds light on the role of financial bonuses in helping prompt administrators to behave unethically. Here is the logic behind the incentive system: Reducing wait times by getting patients seen quickly is good for both patients and hospitals. So, administrators could receive financial bonuses by keeping wait times short. But the bonuses ended up motivating bad behavior. Rather than improving health care, the administrators falsified records so that wait times looked shorter on paper. What went wrong? Incentives can lead to greater performance, but employees may be so focused on the potential of receiving them that they end up cutting corners and crossing ethical boundaries. Research by Wharton management professor Maurice Schweitzer and colleagues shows that when people are rewarded for goal achievement, they are more likely to engage in unethical behavior, such as cheating by overstating their performance, especially when they fall just short of their goals. We all want to be good people who care about the well-being of others in addition to our own. This very likely holds true also for administrators and employees working in VA hospitals. Were bonuses ties to VA wait times? Here's what we know . Yet we are often unable to behave in ways that are consistent with this desire and use all sorts of self-serving justifications to rationalize our behavior, my research shows. For instance, if we perceive goals as too difficult or even unattainable, we may use such evidence to justify our cheating. In the case of the VA scandals, the performance target required administrators to schedule appointments for primary care doctors to meet with patients within 14 days of each patient's desired appointment date. Given the high demand and lack of doctors, this was a standard that most administrators perceived as impossible to meet. Thus, acting unethically may have not seem that wrong to them, given that the goals were not fairly set to start with. The ways that goals and financial incentives are set can lead most people not to follow their moral compass. Financial incentives on their own, research has shown, change our attitudes and behaviors in selfish ways. Even merely thinking about money leads people to be less helpful and fair in their dealings with others, to be less sensitive to social rejection and to work harder toward personal goals. In fact, money can make us so focused on our selfish motives that it can lead us to behave unethically. In my own research, I found that university students were more likely to cheat on a task after seeing 7,000 dollar bills than after seeing 24. Similarly, across a variety of studies, participants who were primed to think about money were more likely to cheat after completing a task by inflating their performance as compared with people in a control condition. In one study, we asked college students to make as many coherent sentences as they could out of a set of words they had been presented with. In one group, some word sets were seeded with ones associated with money, such as ""dollars,"" ""financing"" and ""spend"" (thus priming people with the concept of money). In another group, the words were all neutral. Next, the students completed a second test: They had to solve math puzzles under time pressure. They were asked to report their performance and received a packet of money so that they could reward themselves with a dollar for each correctly solved puzzle. Eighty-eight percent of those who had been primed with money-related words in the first test cheated, but only 67% of those given neutral words did. Money is ubiquitous in our daily lives and prominent in the Western culture's psyche. So these findings might explain, at least in part, why financial incentives can encourage the wrong behaviors -- and why, though we want to be good people, we so often diverge from our moral compass. Tie financial bonuses to ill-conceived goals, and you'll end up with people being more likely and more comfortable cheating. Recognizing the malleability of our moral compass is important since it can help us identify potential solutions to our frequent ethical failures. One way to keep us on track is to identify ways to make ethical standards salient at the time we face ethical challenges. Drawing people's attention to moral standards, in fact, can effectively reduce dishonesty. For example, consider a study (PDF) my colleagues and I conducted in collaboration with a major U.S. car insurance company. As part of the study, we sent 13,488 of the company's customers a form that asked them to report the number of miles they had driven the prior year, as indicated on their cars' odometers. Cheating by under-reporting mileage would come with the financial benefit of lower insurance premiums. On about half of the forms sent out, customers were supposed to sign to indicate their truthfulness at the bottom of the form. The other half of the forms asked the customers to sign at the top of the form. The average mileage reported by customers who signed the form at the top was more than 2,400 miles higher than that reported by customers who signed at the bottom of the form. Our follow-up research demonstrated that signing at the top of the form (before reporting information that could be inflated) increased the salience of ethical standards by highlighting people's self-identity and improving their ethicality. So the disparity in average mileage suggests a difference in reporting ethics rather than in driving habits. Getting rid of incentive and bonus systems seems rather impractical. What this research suggests is that in order for incentive systems not to lead to the wrong behavior, they need to be introduced with particular care. They need to be supported by an organization's culture that stresses the importance of integrity, not just on paper. For instance, both the CEO and senior management in an organization should make their commitment to integrity visible and clear to employees, and communicate the value they put on ethics in orientation programs, annual reports, newsletters, meetings and training sessions. They should not only stress the importance of -- and reward -- high levels of performance, they should focus attention on the means that are used to reach it. Most of us understand that we slip up occasionally, despite our best intentions, and that others do as well. And so it's useful for organizations to consider some simple interventions that can help their customers and employees stick to their ethical principles.

"(CNN) -- A song about the joy of thrift shops put Macklemore & Ryan Lewis on the charts, but it's their musical attack on homophobia that's earning Grammy nominations. When the Recording Academy revealed nominations for the 56th Grammy Awards Friday night, the hip-hop duo was named in seven categories, including for best new artist, song of the year and album of the year. ""Seven is unbelievable,"" Lewis told CNN. ""We came here hoping for one."" Only Jay Z's nine nominations topped them. A testament to their popularity came from rocker Melissa Etheridge, who won her first Grammy two decades ago. She became a Macklemore & Ryan Lewis fan when her daughter asked her to listen to their song ""Same Love,"" which is now contending for song of the year. Etheridge was so excited to meet the duo backstage at the Grammy nominations show, she stopped her interview with CNN to chase them down and hug them. ""I just had to tell them when something comes into the music scene, which then seeps into pop culture, you just can't take it away,"" Etheridge said. Check the full nominations list . English singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran, who was also nominated for best new artist, said in a CNN interview that he'd rather Macklemore & Lewis win the Grammy. ""They've achieved so much this year in popular culture,"" Sheeran said. ""They really changed things doing a song about homophobia."" The other new artist Grammy contenders are English electronic music producer James Blake, hip-hop artist Kendrick Lamar -- who is nominated for seven Grammys overall -- and country singer Kacey Musgraves -- who has four nominations. Noticeably absent from the best new artist category is Lorde, whose smash hit ""Royals"" did earn nominations for record of the year, song of the year and best pop solo performance. The 17-year-old New Zealand singer-songwriter's debut album ""Pure Heroine"" is also nominated for best pop album. Legendary producer Jimmy Jam, who is chairman emeritus of the Recording Academy, suggested that Lorde's omission was because she, in effect, ""skipped a grade"" by having such a successful debut song. ""She is still very new,"" he told CNN. ""Sometimes I think the Grammy voters like to say 'Well, let's see what else you have before we say you're the best new artist.'"" Lorde's song, which carries a message criticizing the materialism of the pop music scene, spent nine weeks at the top of the Billboard Hot 100 chart this year. She performed it live on the Grammy nominations telecast Friday. ""She's pretty unstoppable right now,"" Jimmy Jam said. ""She had a great performance tonight, which I think will resonate in people's minds. She's so young, but a great songwriter. I think the sky's the limit for her."" He compared Lorde's situation to that of Katy Perry, whose ""I Kissed a Girl"" was a big hit five years ago. It earned her a best female pop vocal Grammy nomination, but she was passed over for best new artist. ""Grammy voters felt that one single was really good, but let's see what else she has,"" he said. Perry proved since then that she is the real thing. Grammy voters nominated her ""Roar"" for song of the year and best pop solo performance this year. ""Blurred Lines,"" the Robin Thicke summer hit with T.I. and Pharrell Williams, is up for song of the year and best pop duo/group performance. Their chances of taking home a Grammy might be hurt, though, by the legal battle with the heirs of the late Marvin Gaye, who argue it ripped off his ""Got to Give It Up"" classic. Pharrell Williams could still win in those categories because he's also nominated for other work in each. In all, he has seven nominations in four categories. Justin Timberlake is also up for seven Grammys. His ""The 20/20 Experience"" was passed over in the album of the year category, but it is nominated for best pop vocal album. He shares a nomination with Jay Z in the best pop duo/group category for the song ""Suit & Tie"" and his single ""Mirrors"" is nominated for best pop solo performance. Drake was nominated for five Grammys, including for best rap performance for ""Started from the Bottom."" The rapper canceled plans to perform at Friday's nominations telecast citing schedule complications. Daft Punk is up for four Grammys, including record of the year -- for their hit ""Get Lucky"" -- and album of the year for ""Random Access Memories."" Bruno Mars earned four Grammy nominations. His ""Locked Out of Heaven"" is up for record of the year and song of the year. Country crossover singer-songwriter Taylor Swift's ""Red"" is nominated for album of the year and country album of the year. She's also nominated for best country duo/ group performance and best country song. She performed on Friday night's show from Australia. Fantasia's latest album ""Side Effects of You"" brought the 2004 American Idol winner three Grammy nominations. The nominations list, which has 82 categories, has several legendary names on it with new music. Paul McCartney's ""Live Kisses"" is nominated in the best music film category. The former Beatle is competing for the best rock song Grammy against Rolling Stones Mick Jagger and Keith Richards. The best rock album Grammy competition reads almost like the billing from a 1970s rock festival with Black Sabbath, David Bowie, Led Zeppelin and Neil Young with Crazy Horse nominated. Queens of the Stone Age and Kings of Leon are the youngsters in the race. The Grammys will be handed out in Los Angeles on January. Most of them will be announced in a pre-telecast ceremony, but the top awards will be presented in a music-filled three hour broadcast on the CBS network.","Jay Z gets nine nominations .

"(CNN) -- Air travelers across the country are breathing a sigh of relief that they might get to their destinations on time after Congress took action to roll back a part of the automatic spending cuts that forced furloughs on air traffic controllers. As someone with a 2,300-mile commute, I understand the frustration that travelers felt as delays tripled to nearly 9,000 by Thursday evening -- I am pleased air traffic controllers are back on the job full-time. I am not relieved, however, that Congress gave the Obama administration authority to end furloughs but has not yet done a single thing to help the many Americans who are suffering the consequences of these cuts. Congress made a Band-Aid fix when sequestration needs a triple-bypass surgery. In my district, and across the country, kids are being turned away from early education programs like Head Start. Children in military communities are being hit especially hard because federal dollars that support their schools have been slashed. And communities are reporting that funding cuts are forcing them to kick some seniors off Meals on Wheels. But it was business travelers and vacationers who took center stage last week, and it was for them alone that Congress acted. On Friday morning, just hours before many in Congress would head to the airport to catch flights home for a weeklong district work period, the House of Representatives voted to end the furloughs of air traffic controllers. Airline passengers can now count on more reliable service. But the kids in my district who are losing their school bus can't book a flight to class. When Congress passed sequestration, it was considered such an unthinkable option with such unfathomable consequences that it would have to be replaced. Members from both sides of the aisle gave long speeches about the harm that would come if we allowed the sequester to go into place unmodified. And yet Republicans seemed to be shocked, shocked, to find flight delays ripple through airports across the country. They ran to television cameras to point fingers at President Obama, saying these delays were preventable. I am not sure what they expected to happen. It would be irrational to expect that we can cut more than $600 million from the FAA budget in six months and not see effects on the flying public. Just as we should not expect that we can cut 4 million meals to seniors, as the White House reports, and not hurt them. Everyone in America who watched CNN last week learned the sequester has real consequences. While members of Congress aren't getting a lot of calls for 4-year-olds being turned away from Head Start programs, that doesn't mean they don't exist. Their voices may not be as loud as air travelers were last week, but their pain is greater. Congress can and should pass legislation that will replace the entire sequester with a balanced approach to deficit reduction that includes spending cuts, reduction in future spending growth, and new revenues. Congress created this problem. We need to fix it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Rick Larsen.","Rick Larsen: Congress helped air travelers, but not others suffering from sequester cuts .

"(CNN) -- When two-time winner Alberto Contador was forced to quit the Tour de France after a painful crash the outlook looked bleak for the Tinkoff-Saxo team but since his departure a new star has emerged in Polish rider Rafal Majka. The 24-year-old was a last-minute inclusion in its squad for the Tour, but has seized his opportunity with both hands, claiming his second stage win Wednesday and the second in a row for Tinkoff-Saxo. Like teammate Michael Rogers the day before, Majka proved the strongest of a breakaway group on the short but punishing 124.5 km stage from Saint-Gaudens to Pla d'Adet. The points he gained on the climbs and at the finish saw him stretch his lead in the battle for the polka dot jersey of the King of the Mountains winner. Majka is one of a number of young riders making a big impression in the 2014 Tour, but it is still being led by Italy's Vincenzo Nibali, who finished third on stage 17, pulling away from his nearest rivals on the final climb. Only France's Jean-Christophe Peraud was able to hold his wheel to improve his chances of finishing on the podium in Paris Sunday, holding fourth spot, but only eight seconds adrift of compatriot Thibaut Pinot. Nibali has extended his advantage to five minutes 26 seconds over Movistar's Alejandro Valverde with one further tough stage in the Pyrenees to come ahead of Saturday's individual time trial. With Contador and defending champion Chris Froome sidelined by earlier crashes, the Astana star has dominated the race and looked untroubled again on the penultimate stage in the mountains. Majka, who finished sixth in this year's Giro D'Italia, first made his mark on the Tour in the Alps, winning at the Risoul ski station last Saturday in fine style, a major boost for his team after the loss of Contador to a broken shin on Bastille Day, July 4. ""Our team had bad luck in stage 10, but after that Bjarne (Rjiis) said that we needed to fight for a stage victory,"" he told the official Tour de France website. ""We didn't win one but three stages, and now with the polka dot jersey, I feel good. But there's still one hard stage to go, I will fight more because this jersey is really important for the team."" Thursday will see Nibali and the rest of the peloton tackle the feared climbs of the Tourmalet and Hautacam on a 145.5km leg from Pau.","Rafal Majka wins 17th stage of Tour de France .
