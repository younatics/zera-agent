"Identified: Grant Adamson, 55, descendant of one of the founding families of Malibu, died in a ballooning accident in Switzerland . Grant Adamson, a Pepperdine University supporter and descendant of a founding family of Malibu, has been identified as the American tourist who was killed in a hot air balloon accident in Switzerland Tuesday. Pepperdine Vice Dean Shelley Saxer said the school is deeply saddened by Adamson's passing at age 55, and the serious injuries sustained by his wife, Terry, and their daughters, Lauren and Megan. Swiss police said the hot air balloon carrying Adamson and family crashed into an electric power line while trying to land after a two-hour flight Tuesday morning. The balloon fell 165 feet in the crash. Local officials are investigating the incident. Grant Adamson, 55, was a founding member of Pepperdine's Crest Advisory Board, a community support group, and Terry Adamson was a distinguished jurist in residence at the law school. Their daughters, aged 20 and 24, are students at the school. Lauren and Megan Adamson underwent surgeries for unspecified life-threatening injuries and are now recovering. Their mother suffered internal injuries and is currently on a ventilator. A relative told The Malibu Times she is expected to have surgery in the coming days. Swiss police said Mr Adamson, 55, died at the scene. His family were airlifted to a hospital. A 65-year-old hot air balloon pilot was also hospitalized with serious injuries. Fighting for survival: Grant's wife, Terry Adamson (left), pictured with her daughter Megan, is awaiting to undergo surgery after suffering unspecified internal injuries . Family man: Those who knew Grant Adamson, pictured here with his wife, described him as a loving husband and father who was very close to his family . The Malibu Times reported that Grant Adamson owned the Mariposa Land Company, which managed the real estate holdings that have been in the family for over a century, and he was a founding member of Pepperdine University’s Crest Board. Terry Adamson had served as a commissioner at the Malibu Courthouse for nearly two decades until her retirement in 2007. She also worked as an adjunct professor at Pepperdine School of Law. The family lives in a well-appointed home in the exclusive gated community of Serra Retreat in the hills of lower Malibu Canyon. Mr Adamson was a descendant of the founding family of Malibu. In 1892, his great-grandparents Frederick and May Knight Rindge purchased the land upon which the city was built. ‘This family owned Malibu,’ resident Andy Stern told NBC Los Angeles. ‘They owned the entire city.’ Combing the scene: Swiss police officers inspect the gondola of the hot air balloon after it hit power lines and crashed . Tragedy: Police in the state of Fribourg say Grant Adamson died at the scene when the balloon fell 165 feet after . it crashed into an electric power line while trying to land at 8.35am . Survivors: The police said his 55-year-old wife and their two daughters, aged 20 and 24, have life-threatening injuries and were evacuated by helicopter to a hospital . Tragic: The balloon crashed in Montbovon near Chateaux d'Oex, Switzerland, at around 8.35 this morning . In 1930, the scion's grandparents Rhoda May . and Merritt Adamson built Adamson House, known among the locals . as the ‘Taj Mahal of Tile’ because of its use of ceramic Malibu . Potteries tiles, according to The Hollywood Reporter. The . state bought the property in 1969 and planned to level it in order to . expand a parking lot by the beach, but the house was saved thanks to the . efforts of the Malibu Historical Society. In 1985, Adamson House became a California Historical Landmark and opened to the public as a museum. In . 1968, Rhoda May Adamson donated 132 acres of family ranch land to . Pepperdine University, where the school opened its oceanfront campus in . 1972 – a magnanimous gesture that has been dubbed by some as the ‘Malibu . Miracle,’ NBC Los Angeles reported. Historic: Grant's grandparents Rhoda May and Merritt Adamson built in 1930 the landmark Adamson House, known among the locals as the 'Taj Mahal of Tile' Preserved: The state bought the property in 1969 and planned to level it and replace it with a parking lot, but Adamson house was saved and later opened as a museum . ‘If there were royalty in Malibu, it would be the Adamsons,’ Malibu Mayor Joan House told the station. Grant and Terry met in 1977 while attending the University of California, and they were married for 29 years. Neighbor . Jeff Follert, who has lived near the Adamsons for more than a dozen . years, described the patriarch of the influential family as a . soft-spoken, loving man who was very close to his wife and daughters. The . family, which traveled often together, had chartered the hot air . balloon Tuesday for a day of sightseeing in Chateau-d'Oex - an area known . as the ballooning capitol of the world. Generous: Rhoda May Adamson donated 132 acres of family ranch land to Pepperdine University, where the school opened its oceanfront campus . Close ties: Grant Adamson (right) was a founding member of Pepperdine's Crest Advisory Board, a community support group, and Terry Adamson is a law professor there . Posh: The family lives in a home at the exclusive gated community of Serra Retreat in the hills of lower Malibu Canyon . The craft took off from the Grand Hotel and came down in the hill town of Montbovon after colliding with electric power lines and plummeting 165 feet to earth. Medics rushed to the scene but were unable to resuscitate Mr Adamson, while his wife and two daughters were taken by helicopter to a nearby hospital with life-threatening injuries. Police are now investigating whether pilot error could be blamed for the crash, which happened at 8.35am after a two-hour flight. The 65-year-old pilot also was seriously injured and was taken to the hospital by ambulance. Perfect home: Mr Rindge (second right) built a large ranch house in Malibu Canyon, beneath present-day Serra Retreat, which he considered the ideal home for his family . Castle: Rindge's daughter, Rhoda Rindge Adamson, lived in this palatial home on Vaquero Hill, which was later sold to the Franciscan Order for $50,000 . Grant Adamson came from one of the most prominent families in the state and resided in the same area where his great-grandparents built a life for themselves more than a century ago. Frederick and May Knight Rindge bought a 13,330-acre tract of land in 1892, where they built their dream home: Rancho Malibu - a working cattle and grain-growing ranch. When Mrs Knight Rindge lost her husband in 1905, she continued running the family business and spent nearly two decades fighting the state in court to protect her property and keep it private. Using a loophole, the tenacious widow managed to outsmart a major railroad company seeking to build tracks across her land by starting her own small railroad. But Mrs Rindge was unable to stop the state from constructing two public highways. Lost battle: Mrs Rindge fought hard to keep the state from building a road across her property, but in 1929,  Roosevelt Highway, now Pacific Coast Highway, opened to the public between Santa Monica and Oxnard . Rich and famous: A view of the movie colony at Malibu Beach, California. In the foreground is the home of Fred Beetson, the first aide to Will Hays, namesake of the Hays Code for censorship of American films . The enterprising woman fought to preserve and increase her family's assets, starting Malibu Potteries to boost revenue and make tiles for two homes she was building at the time. Rindge's ventures fell on hard times during the Great Depression, and by the time May Knight Rindge died in 1941, her land was in insolvency. Patriarch: In 1892, Frederick Hastings Rindge and his wife, May Knight Rindge, purchased a 13,330-acre tract of land known as Rancho Malibu . In 1892, Frederick Hastings Rindge and May Knight Rindge, the fourth and last owners of the entire Rancho Malibu, purchased a 13,330-acre tract of land, which they later expanded by buying up the holdings of homesteaders with adjacent property. Mr Rindge built a large ranch house in Malibu Canyon, beneath present-day Serra Retreat – the home of the Adamsons - to serve as a headquarters for Rancho Malibu. It was a working cattle and grain-raising ranch, which was to become one of the most valuable large real estate holdings in the U.S. In 1903, the Malibu Canyon home was destroyed by a brush fire, and two years later, Frederick Hastings Rindge died at the age of 48. Following her husband’s passing, May  Rindge took over the management of the family business . May Rindge, dubbed ‘Queen of the Malibu’ by her critics, wanted to be left alone to run her Rancho Malibu, but in 1904, the Southern Pacific Railroad applied to the Interstate Commerce Commission to build tracks linking the Long Wharf in Santa Monica with their northern tracks at Santa Barbara. Using a loophole in the law, the Rindges were able to save their property by building a private 15-mile-long railroad through Rancho Malibu called the Hueneme, Malibu and Port Los Angeles Railway. The line was completed in 1908 and remained in use until the 1920s, mainly to ship grains and hides from the ranch operations via the Malibu Pier. The Rindge family, however, were unable to stop the construction of the County Road through Malibu Ranch, which opened in 1921 after more than a decade of legal battles. More lawsuits followed after the state decided to construct a highway along the coast. 'The Queen of Malibu': When Mrs Knight Rindge lost her husband in 1905, she continued running the family business, opening new ventures and spending nearly two decades fighting the state in court to protect her property and keep it private . Despite May Rindge’s resistance, which at one point even involved armed guards on horseback hired to keep works crews away from her property, Roosevelt Highway, now Pacific Coast Highway, opened to the public between Santa Monica and Oxnard in June 1929. In 1924-1926 the Rindge Dam was constructed on Malibu Creek and in 1928 May Rindge started construction of a great 50-room house on Laudamus Hill in Malibu Canyon overlooking the sea. She started Malibu Potteries to make tiles for the Laudamus Hill home and a second home on Vaquero Hill for her daughter, Rhoda Rindge Adamson. During the Great Depression, all of her ventures fell on hard times . When May K. Rindge died February 8, 1941, at the age of 76, her land was in insolvency. Her unfinished castle along with 26 acres of land and thousands of crated Malibu Potteries tiles were sold to the Franciscan Order for $50,000. Today, it is known as the Serra Retreat House. Rhoda Rindge Adamson's home on Vaquero Hill was acquired by the California Department of Parks and Recreation in 1969 with the intention of razing it to provide a parking lot for Surfriders Beach. For 14 years, the Malibu Historical Society fought against the destruction, and through their sustained efforts the property was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. The house, with its 13 garden acres and walls covered with Malibu Potteries tile, was spared to become the Malibu Lagoon Museum.

"An aspiring actress trying to pursue her dream of a show business career in Las Vegas has revealed her secret past as a telephone psychic. Despite telling her boss she had no mystical qualities, Erin Auerbach took a job as a tarot reader for customers who paid to listen to her predictions on a premium phone line. What had seemed like a fun and easy way to make money soon became an emotional burden however, as Auerbach fielded calls from perverts, angry skeptics and lonely clients reaching out for human comfort and some hope. Mystic: Erin Auerbach took a job as a telephone psychic while studying in Las Vegas . Auerbach had been desperate for work while she studied theater at UNLV when she spotted a classified advert for 'phone actors'. Intrigued by the promise of working from home and setting her own hours, the 38-year-old decided to get in touch. 'Could it be true? Or was this some sort . of telemarketing scheme?' Auerbach wrote in Salon. 'I called the number. A friendly man assured me . that this was completely legit.' Lured by the promise of $7 an hour, rising to $15 for 'psychics' who racked up the most calls, Auerbach decided to give it a go, but there was just one problem. 'The thing is, I’m not sure that I’m psychic,' she admitted at a training session, but was reassured that all she would need was a professional name and a pack of tarot cards. The main purpose was to keep clients, who paid $5 a minute, on the phone for as long as possible. After reinventing herself as Anita - the name of the hospice nurse who had cared for Auerbach's father after his liver transplant - the aspiring actress was ready for her first call. Psychic phone line: Erin was employed to do tarot readings for callers . Change of fortune: Erin had moved to Las Vegas to pursue her dreams of a career in theater . 'About half of the callers were on to . me immediately. They would tell me that they thought this was nonsense . and that I was a fraud. The first surly customer I encountered pummeled . me,' Auerbach wrote in Salon. As the male caller's voice became more angry, Auerbach did her best to keep to the script and keep him on the line. 'I’m . shuffling my tarot cards. Now ask me a question, . and we’ll see if they can give you some of the answers you’re looking . for?,' she told him. 'OK, genius. What’s my wife’s name?' he replied before hanging up. The abrupt end to the call panicked Auerbach who had been warned if not enough calls lasted for an average of 10 minutes, she would be fired. Auerbach soon found a way to relate to clients, reassuring them that love - or that big career break - was just around the corner. While playing the part of Anita was difficult for Auerbach, one of her actor friends who worked for a different company, was relishing in his role. 'He thoroughly enjoyed perpetrating a fraud,' she said. 'He started each call by saying that he just drank a vial of lamb's blood to give him fortune-telling superpowers.' And although he admitted many people didn't believe him, it made for a light-hearted conversation that kept clients on the phone. Rather than making clients laugh, Auerbach's psychic hotline became a place where the lonely would talk about their problems sometimes for an entire hour. One example was a woman named Judy who called in the middle of the night. By the end of the call Auerbach knew all about her dead husband and ungrateful children. Comfort: Erin, pictured with her two dogs, found herself providing a sympathetic ear to lonely clients . 'I predicted . that she would travel and meet a new soul mate. Judy laughed a lot, . cried a little and paid $300 for the privilege of speaking to me,' Auerbach admitted. 'Those folks really didn’t give a damn about . psychics or readings. They just wanted to talk to a friendly voice,' she added. 'Some . people had terrible problems and cried a lot.' Auerbach did her best to keep calls from those in serious despair short, giving clients toll free helplines to contact instead. As well as the lonely, and the angry skeptics who would call up just to shout at her, Auerbach encountered several men under the impression that all premium rate phone lines served the same purpose. While these dodgy callers panted down the phone, asking if she knew what they were doing, Auerbach would continue with the tarot reading until meeting her ten-minute target. After that, she would end the reading and say 'Oh yeah, I know what you're doing.' And, when they asked what she thought about it, she would reply: 'Fine by me. You’re the one who’s getting screwed.' Her future as a telephone tarot reader was cut short thanks to a mysterious stranger from Alaska who had called for advice and unwittingly gave Auerbach the help she needed to see a new future for herself. The 18-year-old had wanted to know whether he should enlist in the military to help pay for college. As he talked about his parents' death and longing to find a place where he would fit in, Auerbach found herself relating to his plight. Chance encounter: A phone call from a young man desperate to fit in made Erin realize she couldn't continue as a telephone psychic . 'My . stomach hurt. I identified with his uncertainty, his searching for a . place to fit in, and his desire to escape, but I had a safety net. He . didn’t,' Auerbach said. 'That’s when it occurred to me that I had no business trying to . guide anybody’s major life decisions. I had enough trouble with my own.' When he asked what the cards were saying to do, Auerbach told him she couldn't help and suggested he went to family and friends for advice. The encounter made her end the young man's call and vow to never work as a phone psychic again.","Premium phone line attracted the lonely, the perverted and angry skeptics .

"A ten-year-old Norwegian boy who drove his parents’ car into a snowy ditch offered an inventive excuse to police: he was a dwarf who had forgotten his driver’s license. The boy – who lives near Dokka, a town 110kms (68 miles)  north of Oslo – put his 18-month old sister into the car sometime before 6am, while his parents were still sleeping and set off to visit his grandparents in Valdres, about 60 kilometres away. He drove more than 10 kilometres before veering off the road, where he was found by a snowplow driver who alerted police.

"People who derive their happiness from helping others, like Mother Teresa, have strong antibody genes, UCLA scientists claim . American scientists have found different types of happiness have surprisingly contrary effects on our genes. UCLA research found that people who derive their happiness from helping others have strong antibody genes, while people who get their kicks from self-gratification can suffer from low antiviral and anitbody gene expression. The study, which also involved the University of North Carolina, is the first of its kind to examine how positive psychology impacts human gene expression. People who are do-gooders have high levels of 'eudaimonic well-being'. They derive their happiness from a deep sense of purpose and meaning in life showed favourable gene-expression profiles in their immune cells. Those studied from this happiness group had low levels of inflammatory gene expression and strong antibody and antiviral genes. However, individuals who have high levels of 'hedonic well-being' - the type of happiness that comes from consuming goods and self-gratification - showed the opposite. This group of people showed  high inflammation and weak antibody and antiviral genes. The study's findings were published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The research, led by Steven Cole, a UCLA professor of medicine and Barbara L. Fredrickson of the University of North Carolina, has taken a decade. The scientists have looked at how the human genome responds to fear, stress, misery and other negative mental states, but focused on how human genes might respond to positive psychology in this study. They studied the biological implications of hedonic and eudaimonic well-being through some 21,000 genes. Previous research found immune cells . show a shift in baseline gene expression profiles during times of . uncertainty, stress and fear. The . shift is characteristised by an increased expression of genes involved . in inflammation and less of those involved in antiviral and antibody . functions. Individuals who had high levels of 'hedonic well-being' - the type of happiness that comes from consuming goods (pictured) showed high inflammation and weak antibody and antiviral genes . Professor Cole believes the response probably evolved to help human immune systems cope with the changing nature of microbial threat associated with changing social and environmental conditions at the time. The threats included bacterial infection from wounds produced by fighting and increased risk of viral infections as people lived closer together and became more sociable. Professor Cole said: 'In contemporary society and our very . different environment, chronic activation by social or symbolic threats . can promote inflammation and cause cardiovascular, neurodegenerative and . other diseases and can impair resistance to viral infections.' In the present study, the researchers . drew blood samples from 80 healthy adults who were assessed for hedonic . and eudaimonic well-being, as well as negative psychological and . behavioral factors. The study concluded that doing good and feeling good have very different effects on the human genome, even though they generate similar levels of positive emotion. Human chromosomes under a scanning probe microscope are pictured . The team used the gene-expression profile to map the potentially distinct biological effects of hedonic and eudaimonic well-being. The study found people with eudaimonic well-being showed favorable gene-expression profiles in their immune cells and those with hedonic well-being showed an adverse gene-expression profile. But interestingly professor Cole said: 'People with high levels of hedonic well-being didn't feel any worse than those with high levels of eudaimonic well-being.' 'Both seemed to have the same high levels of positive emotion. However, their genomes were responding very differently even though their emotional states were similarly positive.' 'What this study tells us is that doing good and feeling good have very different effects on the human genome, even though they generate similar levels of positive emotion. 'Apparently, the human genome is much more sensitive to different ways of achieving happiness than are conscious minds.'","American scientists said individuals who derive their happiness from a sense of purpose showed favourable gene-expression profiles in their immune cells .

"Created: . 09:17 EST, 22 April 2014 . A Saudi prince has been accused of killing 2,000 birds that are on the verge of extinction while on a safari holiday in Pakistan earlier this year. Prince Fahd bin Sultan bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud - who is commonly known as Fahd bin Sultan - is said to have killed 1,977 near-extinct houbara bustards while on a 21-day trip to Chagai in Pakistan's Balochistan province in January. An earlier version of this article wrongly included a photograph of HRH Prince Sultan bin Fahd bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, who had no connection with the hunting trip. At risk: Hunting in Pakistani sees the global houbara population shrink by between 20 and 30 per cent annually. Houbaras are highly valued by Arab royals, who consider their meat to be an aphrodisiac . An additional 123 bustards - which . are covered by laws to protect endangered species - were slaughtered by . members of the prince's travelling party, bringing the total killed to . 2,100. Fahd bin Sultan, 63 . -the governor of Saudi Arabia's Tabuk Province and the second eldest son . of late Crown Prince Sultan - is accused of hunting illegally in . protected areas, according to a report by Karachi-based Dawn News. The website claims to have seen a . document titled ‘Visit of Prince Fahd bin Sultan bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud . regarding hunting of houbara bustard' which they say was prepared by . Jaffar Baloch - a divisional officer in the local forest and wildlife . department. The report . allegedly says the prince and his party hunted for 21 days - from Jan . 11, 2014 to Jan 31 - and had been granted special permits by the . Pakistani federal government which allow important visitors to bypass . laws preventing the hunting of houbaras. These . permits still require the recipient to kill no more than 100 birds over . a 10-day period however, and only allow them to do so in certain areas. It is not known if Fahd . bin Sultan or any or his party will face punishments for violating the . rules over how many birds they killed and for hunting with falcons . outside the specified areas. Houbaras are highly valued by Arab royals, who consider the meat to be an aphrodisiac. For decades sheikhs have travelled to . remote areas of Pakistan in time for the bird to make its winter . migration from Central Asia. India banned the hunting of houbaras in early 1979. The ongoing hunting in Pakistan has seen global houbara numbers fall to around 110,000 - with that figure decreasing by between 20 and 30 per cent every year. After a particularly aggressive hunting season last year, Pakistan introduced an interim ban on killing the birds. The move proved popular with local environmental campaigners who have grown tired of Arab sheikhs flouting hunting laws, but the Pakistani government appears to have subsequently eased the restrictions, issuing at least 33 houbara hunting permits already this year. One reason they are likely to have done so is because Arab royals bring a huge economic boost to the poor regions in which they hunt. They are said to travel in a convoy of private jets while on safari, with some transport planes given over purely to falcons and hunting equipment. The sheikhs also make large donations while travelling in Pakistan's poor rural areas - paying for new schools and mosques to be built, as well as funding the repair of rundown roads and airports.

"Map showing the regional monthly change in house asking prices . House prices have shot up so far that buyers must earn more than £62,000 - twice the UK's average salary - to afford the average asking price of quarter of a million pounds. New figures show that vendors are asking an average £249,841 - nine times the typical salary in the UK of £26,500. With mortgage firms typically lending a maximum of four times people's salary, borrowers on the UK's average wage could only obtain a mortgage of just over £106,000 - far below the new average asking price. Today's report, from property site Rightmove, shows that asking prices for homes in England and Wales have soared to a new high as confidence returns to the market. This has been the strongest start to the year since 2004 in terms of asking prices, with average prices rising by 9.1 per cent or more than £20,000 in 2013 so far, the website said. London asking prices surged past the half a million pound milestone for the first time this month, standing at £509,870 typically. As well as being more than double the national average, asking prices in London were 8.6 per cent higher than a year ago. Prices rose month-on-month in every region across England and Wales. The North saw the strongest monthly increase, with a 4.2 per cent rise pushing typical asking prices to £152,689. East Anglia saw the second strongest month-on-month growth, with a four per cent rise taking average prices to £233,447. Asking prices in the South East lifted to £325,489 typically and the region saw the second highest annual price growth after London, at 3.7 per cent. Yorkshire and Humberside and the East Midlands were the only regions where prices were lower this month compared with a year ago, dropping by 1.1 per cent and 0.6 per cent respectively. Asking prices in Wales rose by 1 per cent month-on-month to £171,824 typically. The new national peak is around £3,600 higher than a previous high recorded in June last year and the report adds to several studies which have pointed to seller confidence lifting amid signs that home buyers are finding it easier to get access to a mortgage. £250,000 will buy you this one-bed flat in east London, left, or a four-bed farmhouse in Carmarthen, right . On the up: House prices have soared to a new high showing further signs of confidence returning to the market . This has been the strongest start to the year since 2004 in terms of asking prices, with average prices rising by 9.1 per cent or more than £20,000 in 2013 so far . In a further indication that activity is lifting, Rightmove said traffic levels to its website have risen by more than one fifth compared with a year ago, with property hunters getting through 1.25 billion pages in April, which is a record for the website. Another property website, Zoopla, reported last week that just three in 10 house sellers whose home is currently on the market have dropped their asking prices, marking the lowest proportion recorded in three years. The number of mortgages on the market has increased sharply and lenders have slashed their rates since a Government scheme called Funding for Lending was introduced last August. Other initiatives called NewBuy and Help to Buy are specifically aimed at giving people with smaller deposits a helping hand. Lenders have reported that more would-be buyers are making the jump onto the property ladder, which is expected to free up some stuck housing chains in the coming months. Another reason for sellers’ willingness and ability to stand firm on price appears to be a shortage of homes up for sale at a time when the appetite from buyers is increasing. Rightmove said this is creating 'pent-up demand', with 3 per cent fewer properties coming to market this year than in the first five months of 2012. Miles Shipside, director of Rightmove, said the new records were being driven by 'a definite southern bias', although estate agents in most parts of the country are reporting a strengthening of demand. The study quoted an estate agent in London, which has had strong interest from overseas buyers, describing activity levels as 'ridiculous'.

"A magnificent Kent house once owned by a Tory MP who numbered Lawrence of Arabia and Sir Winston Churchill among his friends has been reopened as a hotel by a conservation charity. Port Lympne was the home of bachelor MP Sir Philip Sassoon, an Old Etonian and member of the Bullingdon Club, who represented Hythe from 1912 until his death in 1939. He began to build Port Lympne near Hythe in Kent before the First World War and completed it after being demobbed, spending much of his vast fortune on its decoration and upkeep. Port Lympne Mansion - construction began before the First World War by Sir Philip Sassoon and was completed in the Roaring Twenties .

Simpson before her second divorce and marriage to the duke in June 1937; . Sir Winston Churchill (right) was also part of the social circle at . Port Lympne . Sir Philip, a member of the Rothschild family, was a great host and regular visitors to the house and its stunning grounds included as well as Churchill and TE Lawrence, Edward and Mrs Simpson (the future Duke and Duchess of Windsor) and Charlie Chaplin. The house is now the boutique Mansion Hotel, part of the newly renamed Port Lympne Reserve run by the Aspinall Foundation where animals roam free and visitors receive a safari-like experience. The Mansion, where rooms cost from £172 per night, caters for private parties, weddings and corporate hospitality events as well as being suitable for a getaway break.

"MPs should be given their promised 11 per cent pay rise, the deputy Commons speaker has declared. Labour’s Lindsay Hoyle warned party leaders against trying to block the £7,600 pay hike drawn up by the expenses watchdog. He warned David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg that they must not dictate ‘what is good for backbenchers’ by trying to block the increase from the current level of £65,000. Defence: Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle said it was wrong for political leaders to 'dictate' what backbenchers earn . The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority brushed aside public anger in July to announce salaries for MPs should rise to £74,000 from 2015. The dramatic rise will leave MPs earning roughly three times the national average salary and comes at a time when most other public sector workers have had pay rises capped at just one per cent. All the main party leaders rounded on Ipsa for ignoring the public mood when recommending the rise. But Mr Hoyle said it was not ‘fair’ for those who earn more money to try to ‘dictate’ what rank and file backbenchers should earn. ‘I can see that leaders need to represent. It's about them being the next prime minister or continuing as prime minister,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s Westminster Hour. ‘But in the end backbenchers need a voice and the voice was taken away by giving it to IPSA. ‘IPSA have come forward with a recommendation. It isn't in my opinion the right of leaders to say what is good for backbenchers.’ Hike: The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority recommended MPs' pay increase by 11 per cent or £7,600 . IPSA was set up in the wake of the 2009 expenses scandal to end the practice of MPs setting their own pay and perks. IPSA chairman Sir Ian Kennedy argued that MPs’ pay has fallen behind in recent years – and warn that failure to reward MPs more generously risks a repeat of the 2009 expenses scandal. Mr Hoyle added: ‘If IPSA had come back and said no pay increase, which it's done for the last few years, nobody minds and everybody accepts it. ‘But don't change the rules if you don't quite like the result. ‘It's not up to leaders to start dictating, like it's not up to me to dictate to other MPs. ‘We're on slightly more money than other backbenchers and therefore we shouldn't be saying that you shouldn't have a pay rise. I don't think that's fair. ‘Let the MPs decide or leave it as it is - . with what we agreed with the press and the public that it's independent . of Parliament and that's where I think it should remain.’ Prime Minister David Cameron said a pay rise for MPs would be 'unthinkable' while Deputy PM Nick Clegg said it was 'about the worst time' to increase MPs' pay . MPs’ expenses are back in the headlines after it emerged hundreds of politicians– including Labour leader Mr Miliband – have together claimed a total of £200,000 on expenses to pay their energy bills. Politicians have claimed up to £6,000 each for gas and electricity in their second homes, leaving hard-pressed taxpayers to pick up the bill. Some 340 MPs, some of them multi-millionaires, have taken advantage of the perk at a time when many people are struggling to pay rising utility bills. When the pay rise was first announced, Mr Miliband said he would not take it  but predicted that Ipsa would change its mind after feeling the wrath of voters in the consultation. Deputy Prime Minister Mr Clegg said it was 'about the worst time' to increase MPs' pay and urged the public to bombard IPSA's consultation with angry opposition. Mr Cameron branded the rise ‘unthinkable, while Education Secretary Michael Gove told the 'silly' expenses watchdog which recommended the £7,600 increase they could 'stick it'.","Labour's Lindsay Hoyle insists expenses watchdog must be adhered to .

"A forged police letter obtained by The Mail on Sunday casts new light on the BBC’s controversial decision to drop its documentary on Jimmy Savile. It was handed to this newspaper last week by a woman who appeared on the ITV programme which exposed the entertainer as a predatory paedophile. Identified only as Fiona, she said the letter backed her claims that Surrey Police had dropped its  investigation into the sex abuse allegations because of Savile's ill health and 'senility'. Allegations: 'Fiona' during the ITV documentary on Jimmy Savile. She this week handed the Mail On Sunday a forged police letter casting new light on the BBC's decision to drop its documentary on the late presenter . Newsnight journalists were desperate . to see the letter because its contents were apparently at odds with what . they had been told – that officers were unable to proceed because of . lack of evidence. Producers . believed the letter would provide the breakthrough they needed to . revive their stalled investigation and get the ten-minute film aired. However, . Fiona never sent it to them, and the Newsnight team began to doubt . whether it ever existed – and if everything they were being told was the . truth. The BBC has been . heavily criticised for shelving the item on Savile, which was due to air . just a few weeks before Christmas tributes to the late presenter. On Friday, it agreed to establish  an independent inquiry into why the film was dropped. However, . last night Corporation sources indicated that their dealings with Fiona . – who they said ‘appeared to be playing games with us’ – was a . contributory factor. The . Mail on Sunday has seen the letter – and the BBC’s fears appear to be . justified because it is unquestionably a fake. The note says that Fiona . was interviewed by police in 2006 despite the inquiry not beginning . until May the following year. The . letter is also headed by a Surrey Police crest not in use at the time . it was supposedly written. Significantly, there are no reference numbers . included within the text. A . spokesman for Surrey Police said: ‘This letter is not genuine and was . not sent by us at any time. The suggestion that we advised anyone this . case would not be pursued due to the health of the individual concerned . is wholly inaccurate. ‘An . investigation file was passed to the Crown Prosecution Service who . advised there was not enough evidence to charge. All those involved were . updated accordingly.’ The BBC has been heavily criticised for shelving its Newsnight item on Savile, which was due to air just a few weeks before Christmas tributes to the late presenter . For her part, Fiona denies forging the letter. Although she initially insisted that it was genuine, last night she conceded that she may have been the victim of a hoax. An ITV spokesman declined to comment on the letter last night. A source said the programme’s production team was aware of the letter’s existence, but had not seen it. The insider added that the ITV documentary – Exposure: The Other Side Of Jimmy Savile – centred on the experiences of girls at the hands of Savile, rather than the police investigation. Fiona was first contacted by a Newsnight reporter on November 3 last year. She was told the BBC wanted to ‘verify a few details about what happened there in the Seventies... in relation to Jimmy Savile’s visits to the home’. Fiona claims she spoke with reporters about the allegations of abuse surrounding the presenter and told them about the letter she claimed was sent by Surrey Police officer Angela Sullivan in 2007. The Newsnight team contacted her on November 11 and 22, and again on December 12 asking to see the letter. Fiona claims that she did not respond to the requests because she no longer wanted to be a part of the documentary. 'Sexual predator': The BBC could be forced to pay compensation if they are found to be linked to the claims that Savile molested children . She added: ‘In one of the emails I received from the Newsnight team they said it wasn’t just me, that others had also said it, so I always assumed others had been given a letter like mine. ‘The Newsnight reporters told me that they had hit a brick wall with the investigation and they needed to see the letter I had received from the police. ‘I assumed other people had received [the letter] giving the same reasons. I had spoken to other people who had been told the same things as to why the investigation wasn’t going ahead. ‘One of the reporters wanted me to send it to her so I scanned it on the computer and tried to send it in an email. When they didn’t receive it I assumed I had done something wrong but I didn’t resend it.’ In a final email, a Newsnight reporter wrote: ‘We’ve come up against a brick wall in our story – the CPS tell us the reason they dropped the inquiry is they didn’t have enough evidence. That contradicts what you and others have told us. We can only get round this by seeing the letter. Any chance?’ Fiona said last night: ‘I now understand the significance of not sending them the letter and I am possibly responsible for them not being able to run the story. ‘When they asked for it again I decided this had turned into an argument between who was right, the girls or the CPS. It shouldn’t be about what the CPS were saying, it should have been about the girls.’","Letter handed to Mail On Sunday by woman who appeared on ITV show which exposed Jimmy Savile as a predatory paedophile .

"A Massachusetts State Trooper's heartbreaking letter written just before he took his beloved K9 partner to be put to sleep was shared thousands of times on Facebook in mere hours and shows the inseperable bond of police partners, no matter their species. In Trooper Christopher Coscia's nine years with German shepherd Dante, he came to see the the dog he calls 'Type A' as the truest of friends, even if he is 'best described as a one-person dog. 'Every morning when I opened the door to his kennel he would jump up on me, wrap his paws around my waist, get his morning greeting and pat from me, storm up the stairs, and push the door open ready to go to work,' he wrote. Partner: Massachusetts State Trooper Christ Coscia wrote a tearful tribute to his K9 partner Dante (pictured) that he wrote just before taking the dog to be put to sleep . Tearful: In this photo provided by HopNews, Trooper Coscia is seen getting his beloved Dante ready for a vehicle search . The tearful letter was written as Coscia sat in the car not far from where he was supposed to take Dante to be put to sleep on a recent snowy morning after work was cancelled because of snow. 'It all started one day while taking Dante out to his kennel. He collapsed on me, falling like a rock with no control of his body,' Coscia wrote. Tests revealed that Dante had pulmonary hypertension. His heart was enlarged and he started to suffer seizures due to a loss of blood flow to his brain. 'He had one of these seizures in the yard the other day, and after I sat on the ground in the snow with him patting him calmly waiting for it to be over, I came in the house. Upon walking in, to my dismay, I realized my wife and two children had been intently watching us to make sure all was okay, . 'But it wasn’t and when I walked in the door, my wife and daughter were crying, knowing what was to be coming, possibly sooner than we were ready.'

Much as it does to me as I write this with every new thought and . remembrance of my partner, each paragraph brings a new thought and . anguish for me.' Even . as Coscia drove Dante to his final destination, he was unsure of what he . was doing. He even pulled off the road just to write his letter.

"Amazing drone footage has captured the trail of destruction left by a rockfall in northern Italy. Approximately 4,000 cubic metres of rock broke off a cliff face and then crashed through a barn and vineyards in Tramin on January 21.

The manager of the estate Baron Philipp von Hohenbühel told South Tirol News  that the rockfall has done millions of euros worth of damage. No one was hurt in the landslide, which was reportedly caused by a rock tower in the cliff face dissolving.

"Police had to break up motorists massing at Illinois gas station on Sunday night - after a glitch meant the Shell station was charging just one cent for a gallon of fuel. The national average for a gallon of gas is $3.294 but some lucky drivers in Woodstock, Il, filled up for just $0.011. Word quickly got round and police officers arrived to investigate the congestion. Sergeant Dennis Leard told the Northwest Herald they cleared the line of cars but it immediately reformed. Police then noticed the very cheap gas and realized what was happening. Bargain: Gas was available for a short time at 1 penny a gallon thanks to a glitch at a Shell station in Illinois . Fill up! One lucky driver got 10 gallons of gas for just 12 cents . 'The clerk didn't appear to be aware (of the price change),' Leard told the Herald. 'We made him aware of the situation and instructed him to shut off his pumps and fix the problem.' Sergeant Leard said the bargain fuel was available for around two hours at 315 N. Madison St in the town 51 miles north west of Chicago, before police stopped it after 9.30 on Sunday night. Shell worker Drita Castillo told CBS that she had no idea how many people benefited from the error but said she felt sorry for her boss and was upset that no one alerted staff to the obvious mistake. But local radio station Star 105.5 posted photos of the amazing price on their Facebook page. Congestion: Police were alerted by long lines at the gas station and arrived to clear the traffic jam . Sight for sore eyes: The national average for a gallon of gas is $3.294 but some lucky drivers on Sunday filled up for just $0.011 .

Here's one listener's receipt and we're sure it's been changed since then. Not bad for 10 gallons...12 cents! What's this 1920?' the station wrote. Another photo on the page shows a long line of cars waiting for the gas and the stunning display on the pumps. Castillo told the Herald that she had never seen anything like this before. Though she wasn't working on Sunday night, she was told about the incident on Monday and she immediately checked that prices were back to normal. 'The first thing I did was run outside this morning to make sure the pumps were OK,' she said. 'It's not good for business.'

"A woman captured by surveillance cameras trying to jump to her death from an overpass in China was pulled back to safety by a number of bystanders . The woman, who is dressed in black tights and a pink puffer jacket casually walks up to the railing and quickly surveys what is underneath before climbing up onto the ledge with some degree of difficulty. But the act catches the attention of another woman, who is holding a white umbrella, who runs over to help. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Desperate: Surveillance footage shows a Chinese woman climbing onto the railing to try and commit suicide while no one is around . Help: A woman rushes to help after spotting the woman attempting to jump, but can't pull her to safety because she is still holding her umbrella . The woman planning to jump turns around and catches a glimpse of the bystander upon hearing her running over and quickly tries to get over the ledge. But the woman hesitates as her legs begin to drop, throwing her arms around a concrete pillar and holding on to stay alive. The Good Samaritan is able to extend one of her arms to assist, but is unable to pull the woman to safety because she is still holding her umbrella. A man walking past 50 metres away notices what is happening and sprints over to lend a hand, but the two of them are unable to pull the slight woman, who appears to be middle-aged, back over the railing. Another three people run in to assist – two of them also refusing to drop their umbrellas as they reach in to lend some muscle. A woman walking past stops to see what is going on, before she appears to scream frantically and plead for more people to run in and offer assistance.

Success: The team of 16 manage to pull the Chinese woman to safety after she was dangling dangerously over the edge for more than one minute .

More people then rush in to help, with a total of 16 strangers now working to pull the small woman back up onto the road – a feat they achieve after 66 frightening seconds. The video is a refreshing act of kindness from the group of rescuers, most of whom grew up in an era where self-preservation was ranked as more important than assisting others. It follows another kind-hearted gesture in August last year, where Chinese woman Wang Lan took an elderly woman to hospital after spotting her writhing on the ground in pain. The elderly woman then claimed Ms Wang, who also helped to cover 200 yuan in medical expenses, was the person responsible for her injury and demanded to be compensated 40,000 yuan in damages. Ms Wang was taken to court but her name was cleared after surveillance footage revealed she had not caused the injury to the elderly woman.","Woman rescued after trying to jump to her death from an overpass in China .

"Fleece: Eric Champ has accused the council of charging tenants more to sign a new lease . A defiant council tenant is living a desperate home-alone existence in a high-rise block after every other occupant moved out. Eric Champ is involved in a tenant’s last stand battle with Renfrewshire Council who want to demolish the multi-storey Arkleston Court in Gallowhill, Paisley. The local authority yesterday began a court move to have the property re-possessed in order to bring the bulldozers in. The 53-year-old security officer is challenging their right to do that, claiming the local authority will be in breach of his tenancy agreement if the ruling goes against him. A Sheriff has now been asked to give a judgement and after hearing evidence from both sides, a decision is to be given within 28 days. Mr Champ is the only tenant remaining in the block at the centre of the dispute. Paisley Sheriff Court was told that there are increasing concerns for his wellbeing and safety after the property was targeted by vandals and metal piping damaged, leading to both mains water gas supplies being disconnected. Mrs Lesley Muirhead, the local authority’s housing strategy development manager, said that they were becoming increasingly concerned about Mr Champ’s living conditions. She outlined various offers of alternative accommodation which had been made to him, each of which had been declined on various grounds. She said that despite different financial incentives, the defiant tenant had turned down all that had been offered to him. There were originally a total of 90 flats in the block with six families on each of the fifteen floors. Mr Champ has been the sole occupant for several months as the deadlock deepened. 'It is very unsatisfactory,' she told the court, 'as there have been a number of break-ins and in January, the water pipes were vandalised which meant there was no supply to the block. Demolition: Arkleston Court in Paisley is set to be knocked down once Mr Champ has finally been evicted . 'We have had to put additional security measures in place. 'We were extremely concerned about the consequences if the gas pipes were tampered with as that could lead to a dangerous situation, so he has no gas to his house.' Mr Champ says he came close to accepting the offer of an alternative home in Renfrew but was not prepared to sign a document terminating his existing lease as he felt that would compromise his rights. Referring to documents which were sent to him by the local authority in which he was described as a 'housing applicant', he hit out: 'I am not a housing applicant, I am a tenant with rights.' He maintains the council has a binding contract with him and that offers of alternative accommodation made have come as conditional and not unconditional, undermining his rights. He questions the transfer of lease issues that have come to the fore and has argued that he should be able to retain his existing lease with the landlord with only an alteration inserted to provide details of any new property he might agree to accept. Home alone: Arkleston Court has 90 flats based over 15 floors, but currently just Mr Champ lives there . He told Sheriff David Pender: 'They are negligent and as a result, I have suffered loss, compounded by their intransigence. 'They are unfit to do the job they are doing and that has adversely affected my life and done harm to me. 'People have been encouraged to terminate their old lease and sign a new one, leading to them paying higher rent and I consider that to be theft. 'That is a breach of trust. Ruling: Mr Champ's (right) case has gone before Paisley Sheriff Court. He is fighting to stay in Arkleston Court . 'These people are supposed to be serving the public, not fleecing them. 'They are completely avoiding the liabilities of the contract by hiding behind their statutory obligations.' The local authority has asked the Sheriff to grant a decree in their favour to allow them to recover the property. They have stressed that even if that was granted by the Sheriff, Mr Champ would still be entitled to retain his full secure tenancy agreement, would be provided with suitable alternative accommodation and given financial assistance and support towards re-locating. Defiant: The council claims to have made several alternative offers to Mr Champ, but he has declined them all .","Eric Champ has accused Renfrewshire Council of a Breach of Trust .

"Looking like a scene from a Hollywood disaster movie, crews will attempt on Sunday to remove three Boeing 737 fuselages that tumbled down a steep bank and into the Clark Fork River in western Montana after a train derailed. Montana Rail Link spokeswoman Lynda Frost said Saturday that it's unclear the type of challenge involved because it's the first time the company has faced such a task. No one was injured when 19 cars from a westbound train derailed Thursday about 10 miles west of Alberton. The cause of the derailment is under investigation. Crash: Three Boeing 737 fuselages lie on an embankment on the Clark Fork River after a BNSF Railway Co train derailed Thursday near Rivulet, Montana in this picture taken July 4, 2014 . Huge accident: Three Boeing 737 fuselages lie on an embankment on the Clark Fork River after a BNSF Railway Co train derailed Thursday near Rivulet, Montana in this picture taken July 4, 2014 . Boeing said a BNSF Railway train loaded with six 737 narrowbody fuselages and assemblies for its 777 and 747 widebody jets derailed in Montana while en route from Wichita on Thursday. A total of 19 cars in the 90-car train derailed in the incident about 18 miles (30 km) east of Superior, Montana, said Rail Link Montana. The rail company links with BNSF to carry freight from Billings in southern Montana through the state to Spokane, Washington where it links back to BNSF. Of the derailed cars, three cars carrying 737 plane fuselages went down an embankment and into the Clark Fork River. Spirit Aerosystems, based in Wichita, Kansas, builds all of Boeing's 737 fuselages and Boeing currently produces 42 finished 737s a month. Recovery: Three Boeing 737 fuselages lie on an embankment on the Clark Fork River after a BNSF Railway Co train derailed Thursday near Rivulet, Montana . Derailed: The train wreckage of 3 boeing 737 fuselages on the Clark Fork River in Montana and one pictured at the top still on the train tracks .

Dwarfed: Boaters passing the fuselages of three Boeing aircraft sitting near or in the Clark Fork River after the Montana Rail Link train they were being transported on derailed near Missoula, Montana . So the six fuselages involved in Thursday's derailment represent 14 percent of Boeing's monthly production of 737s. The cause of the derailment was not yet known, said Montana Rail Link spokeswoman Lynda Frost, but added that speed was not considered to be an issue. There is a 35 mph speed limit on that section of the track, which is curvy as it tracks the Clark Fork, she said. The line was being reopened on Saturday afternoon, Frost said. There were no injuries in the accident. Boeing said it had experts at the scene 'to begin a thorough assessment of the situation.' Massive: In total nineteen cars were pushed off the tracks in Alberton on Thursday afternoon, Montana's KRTV reported . Montana Rail Link had called in three contractors to undertake the recovery of the derailed cars, Frost said, but she did not have details of the state of the freight in the derailed cars. Montana Rail Link, a privately-held company, is investigating the cause of the accident. Spirit said it was working closely with Boeing following the incident. 'We are confident that, working together, we will overcome whatever challenges may be presented,' the company said in a statement. Video grab of the train wreckage of 3 boeing 737 fuselages on the Clark Fork River in Montana and one pictured at the top still on the train tracks . Spirit shut down temporarily in April 2012 after a tornado severed power lines and damaged buildings in the region. At the time, Boeing said its production system had a cushion to help it handle those disruptions. The train also was carrying fuselage panels for the 777, and a leading edge flight surface for the 747, the company said. 'Our team of experts is assessing the damage,' Boeing spokesman Doug Alder said in a statement on Saturday. 'Once we determine the extent of damage we will assess what, if any, impact there will be to production.' Boeing reported on Thursday that it delivered 342 jetliners in the first half of the year, including 239 737s, a brisk pace but less than half of its goal of delivering between 715 and 725 jetliners this year.","Crews to work on Sunday to remove the Boeing 737 fuselages that fell into the Clark Fork River, Montana on Thursday .

"It has been her lifelong dream to break away from the show that propelled her to fame and cement her name as a model - and now Kendall Jenner is making her fantasy a reality. The youngest of the Kardashian clan walked in the season's hottest fashion week shows and was last week unveiled as the face of Estee Lauder. Now Karl Lagerfeld, the industry's most esteemed designer, has revealed that Kendall has been chosen as the face of his SS15 campaign. Scroll down for video . Rising star: Kendall Jenner has made the break from Keeping Up With The Kardashians star to in-demand model - and now Karl Lagerfeld has snapped her up to front his self eponymous campaign . According to WWD, the 19-year-old joins fellow Lagerfeld favourites Sasha Luss, Ming Xi and Baptiste Giabiconi in the campaign, which has already been shot at his Paris studio. So, could a Chanel campaign be next on the cards for the burgeoning star? Kendall is no stranger to the prestigious French fashion house and has already walked in Lagerfeld's shows. If she does land the glossy campaign, she will replace best friend and current face of Chanel, Cara Delevingne. The new Chanel girl? Kendall, left, has already walked in the prestigious Chanel show and could well replace her friend Cara Delevingne, right, as the face of the French fashion house . Cara, 23, recently revealed that she will be focussing more on acting in the New Year, which could well leave the role open for Kendall. Kendall's meteoric rise in the fashion industry from her reality TV roots has led her to compare her double life to that of a certain Disney Channel star. 'It's definitely two different worlds. I feel like Hannah Montana. But it's fun,' the model told the New York Times. The new Cara? Kendall (second right) and Cara Delevingne leave Chanel's show in Paris earlier this year . The brunette socialite currently appears on the KUWTK spin-off Kourtney and Khloé Take The Hamptons, which airs Sundays on E! Viewers have seen her grow up in front of the camera as she first appeared on Keeping Up With the Kardashians at the age of 11. The daughter of Kris Jenner and half sister of Kim, Khloe and Kourtney Kardashian, some have questioned whether Kendall has won her modelling contracts on merit or because she's part of the famous family. Moving with the times: Estee Lauder have named Kendall as their new face and asked her to announce the news via her social media accounts . Indeed many were surprised when she was named as the new face of Estee Lauder as in the past they have gone for more established A-listers such as Gwyneth Paltow and Elizabeth Hurley. But it seems the cosmetics giant are keen to appeal to a younger, internet-savvy market, making Kendall the perfect choice. She has more than 9 million followers on Twitter and 16m followers on Instagram. They capitalised on her online popularity by getting her to announce her appointment with them via her social media accounts - including a link to their website showcasing her favourite products. Now many in the fashion industry believe Kendall's star power will keep increasing and could eventually elevate her to the status of supermodel. Balmain creative director Olivier Rousteing told Vogue: 'Kendall is the new pop-culture model. She's inspiring girls in the way Claudia Schiffer or Naomi Campbell did. They aspire to look like her.'

"A revealing video offers a chilling picture of what happens when a frightened boy runs up to strangers on US streets and tells them that a man is trying to kidnap him. Hidden cameras film the reactions of various adults when the boy, played by a child actor named Nathan, tells strangers he had been in the park with his mother when a ‘man in a jacket’ came up to him and tried to put him in his car. ‘He won’t stop chasing me,’ he told one couple. Social experiment: Yousef Saleh Erakat (right) pretended to abduct an actor to see how adults would respond if a stranger kidnapped a child in front of them. This man (left), whom the boy approached for help, continued eating his ice cream and did not intervene . The man in the jacket, played by the creator of The Kidnapping Children Experiment, Yousef Saleh Erakat, then comes over, claiming to be the boy’s father and tells the strangers that the boy has run off and is telling lies. Several adults step in to defend the boy. One man pushes the ‘abductor’ against a car and gives the boy his phone, telling him to dial his mum’s number. One brave woman physically shields the boy when the man comes up and tries to convince her that Nathan is his son. When the ‘abductor’ gets aggressive she sprays him with pepper spray before telling the boy to run. The cameraman chases the woman down and tells her that she is safe and she actually sprayed an actor. The boy, Nathan, would approach strangers and tell them that 'a man in a jacket' took him from his mother and tried to put him in a car . Chilling footage: Sometimes the strangers would believe the 'abductor' and walk off without helping the boy. Like this man who shook the abductor's hand and laughed about the boy telling lies . Even though it is staged, the footage is chilling. Some of the people Nathan approaches on various US streets let him let him walk off with the man. One man even shakes hands with the ‘abductor’ and laughs at the boy’s high-jinks. The Kidnapping Children Experiment was created to raise awareness about the role the public can play in stopping child kidnappings. ‘One decision can change an individuals [sic] life forever. When you are put to the test, will you pass?’ asks the video, which was uploaded to YouTube yesterday. The video’s creator, Yousef Erakat, is a 24-year-old entertainer from California. His YouTube channel FouseyTube is incredibly popular and produced parodies, comedy sketches, and thought-provoking videos including The Bullying Experiment, which went viral last year. Erakat wrote on his YouTube page that he wanted to make the videos because: ‘Growing up my biggest fear was getting kidnapped... This video was a way for me to express that fear in an artistic [sic] way and also spread positive change as to why it is important to ACT when put into these types of situations.’ 'He won't stop chasing me': Nathan approached this couple while they were jogging and told them he was being followed by an 'abductor' Heroic: The couple shielded the boy and when his 'abductor' became aggressive, the woman sprayed him with pepper spray and told the boy to run away . 'You're not his father': Erakat (right) told members of the public that he was the boy's father and that the boy had just run away from him as a joke. Some people, such as the man pictured (centre) did not believe him and physically prevented him from getting to the child . 'He just told me somebody took him': The video, which was released on YouTube, showed the reactions of adults to a young boy who claims someone is trying to abduct him . Passing the test: This man (centre) stopped the 'abductor' from getting close to the boy and gave him his phone so he could call his mother .","Cameras filmed adults approached by a child and his abductor - both actors .

"If, like me, you thought your Barbie days ended about the same time you stopped wearing pigtails and carrying your packed lunch in a glittery pink lunchbox, then think again. Turns out Barbie is this season's new style icon, and everyone from Rita Ora to Lily Allen and Katy Perry is channeling the plastic princess' look. Barbie's style renaissance is all thanks to super-hip fashion designer Jeremy Scott, who designs for the Italian label Moschino. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Binky has looked to the Moschino SS15 catwalk for inspiration behind this week's beauty look . Scott dedicated the brand's entire spring/summer 2015 collection to the pint-sized blonde bombshell. He filled the catwalk with figure-hugging looks in bubble-gum pink, created colourful 'dolly' accessories and even reworked the Moschino logo in that familiar Barbie typeface. I couldn't resist joining in the fun, so this week I've created a sugar-sweet Barbie-inspired beauty look, with bold, baby-pink lips, and tons of sparkle and shimmer – just perfect for a fancy-dress party or a glam girly night out. Binky wanted to recreate the sugary sweet Barbie look as seen on the catwalks of Moschino . BINKY'S BARBIE BEAUTY . Step 1: Eyes . Once you've applied your preferred base, get straight onto the eyes. Begin by blending a soft nude shadow across your lids across my lids, to act as a base. I used Clarins Ombré Matte Eyeshadow in Nude Beige – the cream-to-powder formula of this eyeshadow means it's smooth to apply but is also incredibly long-lasting. Next, add a dusting of sparkle using Too Faced Glamour Dust Glitter Pigment in Blue Angel. Binky has opted for high shine and heavy bronzer to give her cheeks a sculpted look . Glitters can be tricky and messy to work with, so to make things easier dab a small amount onto the back of your hand, then, using a fine eyeshadow brush, carefully dab the pigment over your eyelids to create glitzy sheen. Apply a hint of glitter under the lower lash line too, for super-sparkly Barbie lashes. To give your eyes extra definition, line your upper and lower lash lines with Daniel Sandler Long Lasting Waterproof Eyeliner in Black Velvet. Finally, apply a few coats of Too Faced Lash Injection Mascara – perfect for those long, voluminous lashes that living dolls should have! Step 2: Cheeks . Barbie is famous for her gorgeous cheekbones, so add a touch of contour with bareMinerals Ready Bronzer in The Skinny Dip, dusted under the apples of your cheeks and across your temples. Next up, for gorgeous shimmery cheekbones, you need to pack on the highlighter. Binky says that this look is great for both fancy dress or if you just fancy looking extra girly . Rita Ora was spotted in the Pink Princess look at Halloween (left) and Paris Hilton shared this image of her trying the trend on her Instagram account (right) I used Too Faced Candlelight Glow Highlighter, swirling the two shades in the compact together and blending the powder across the tops of my cheekbones for a gorgeously girly shimmer. Finally, for a really sparkly finish, dust a hint of the Too Faced glitter pigment over your cheekbones. Step 3: Lips . Key to this look is the bright baby-pink lip, as seen on the Moschino catwalk. Try Clarins Rouge Eclat Lipstick in Candy Rose – it is a strongly pigmented pastel pink shade which means the colour really lasts. Finally, to make your pout really pop, add a slick of bareMinerals Marvellous Moxie Lipgloss in the sugar-sweet baby-pink shade Miss Popular. Binky says that a bright lip with a strong pink pigment is essential for achieving the Barbie vibe . You can get all the products I used to create my Moschino-inspired look online at Escentual.com. Life in plastic, it's fantastic! On another fashion-related note, I've booked my ticket to Clothes Show Live at the Birmingham NEC in December. I'm really looking forward to getting a sneak peek into the new season's top trends and of course indulging in a bit of retail therapy! Stay beautiful, .

"With its fuselage torn to shreds and emergency workers seemingly looking on in vain, there was surely only one fate for the passengers of this Boeing 727. Just as well, then, that those on board were only crash-test dummies used for a groundbreaking experiment into the effects of jet disasters. The impact was pulled off deliberately for a documentary by the Discovery Channel and Channel 4 exploring the results of a 'serious, but survivable' crash-landing. The result is a terrifying collision which rips off the front of the jet in a cloud of sand, debris and twisted metal. Scroll down for video of the crash . Groundbreaking: With its fuselage ripped in two, the deliberate crash-landing of this Boeing 727 in the Mexican desert shows just how devastating such an impact can have. The collision was filmed for a documentary and subjected to scientific tests in an effort to further understand 'serious, but survivable' crashes and improve safety . Wrecked: The experiment was designed to study the crash-worthiness of the aircraft's airframe and cabin as well as the impact of such disasters on the human body . They flew the Boeing over a remote part of the Mexican desert before allowing it to smash . into the ground. On this occasion the jet, which can carry up to 170 passengers, contained only crash-test dummies and dozens of interior cameras to film the sequence. A pilot had earlier flown the jet out to a Mexican desert and ejected a matter of minutes before the aircraft was remotely crashed into the ground. The experiment was designed for scientists to study the crash-worthiness of the aircraft's airframe and cabin as well as the impact of crashes on the human body. It is the first time in almost 30 years a passenger plane has been crashed on purpose for a scientific experiment. The last time was in 1984 when NASA teamed up with the FAA to crash a Boeing 720 into the Mojave Desert in California, USA. Going down: The Boeing 727, which can normally carry 170 passengers, plunges into the ground in a remote-controlled descent moments after the pilot ejects . Amateur footage of the crash shows the plane heading into the desert floor while a helicopter flies alongside with a film crew. The latest experiment is expected to . give a better insight into a crash landing thanks to the benefit of . improved filming and remote control technology. The show is the result . of four years' work by London-based TV company Dragonfly Film and . Television Productions. Sanjay Singhal, executive producer of the documentary, said: 'We felt the time was right to do it again. 'It . has never been safer to fly, but we want to use this as an opportunity . to provide scientific data that might help to improve passenger safety . in those extremely rare cases when a catastrophic aircraft accident does . occur. 'This has been an . extraordinary feat of organisation, involving up to 300 people on . location, including the production team, pilots, experts, risk . management, plus local crew, military, fire teams and police.' The plane was crashed in a remote and . unpopulated part of the Sonoran Desert of Baja California, Mexico. The . location was chosen after an extensive international search to find a . suitable location offering the perfect conditions for this . ground-breaking scientific project. First for 30 years: The aircraft, which was loaded with crash-test dummies and cameras, sends sand and debris shooting into the air as it careers into the desert floor . For safety reasons, an exclusion zone at the crash site was manned by security teams, as well as the Mexican military and police. Ahead of the crash, a full safety review of the project was undertaken by the highly-qualified pilots and commanders as well as the Mexican authorities which concluded that it was safe for all concerned. Following the crash, the aircraft will be salvaged and an extensive environmental clean-up operation is being carried out by a reputable agency with the full co-operation of the Mexican authorities. David Glover, Channel 4 senior commissioning editor, added: 'This is a ground-breaking project, allowing a team of leading international scientists and crash investigators the first chance for a generation to study the crash of an entire passenger jet. 'The scientists are also looking at passenger safety, plus new 'black box' flight data recording technology. 'They have been hugely enthusiastic supporters of the project and couldn't wait to get to the crash site. Despite long careers, none of them have seen a plane crash before their eyes like this before. 'We hope that this documentary will provide valuable new scientific results as well as giving passengers vital information about how they can improve their own chances of surviving the extremely unlikely, but frightening, prospect of being in a serious plane crash.' Channel 4 says it will not be releasing official footage of the crash until shortly before the documentary is due to be aired later this year.","Boeing 727 crashed deliberately for documentary exploring the effects of serious impacts on planes and people .

"A waiter who mistakenly threw away up to $7,000 in a 'Tips For Jesus' gratuity is praying that the money can be resurrected. Ron Kinney, 67, waits tables at the French Quarter Restaurant in West Hollywood, California. In December, he received a huge tip on a $50 bill - but threw away the receipt, thinking that a diner had simply had too much to drink. Unbeknown to Mr Kinney, 'Tips for Jesus' is a phenomenon sweeping the country where restaurant staff from New York to Arizona have been left thousands of dollars by an extremely generous, anonymous patron. It's a miracle! Restaurant staff up and down the country have been receiving big tips on checks stamped with @tipsforjesus . It has been claimed that at least one of the 'Tips For Jesus' do-gooders is former PayPal vice president Jack Selby. Former PayPal VP Jack Selby is believed to be behind 'Tips For Jesus' By the time Mr Kinney and his co-workers realized the good fortune, the receipt was gone. Mr Kinney told the San Francisco Chronicle: 'I was pretty naive. 'I thought it was someone who had a drink too many and didn’t realize what they were doing. He added: “The money would sure have come in handy for me to help for retirement. We have no such plan at work.' In December, Aruj Dhuwan, a waiter at . Bo's Kitchen, New York, said he was left a staggering tip of $1,000 . dollars from a table he served late on Saturday night that included Mr . Selby. It was the third time . the Tips For Jesus lightning struck in the city in a single weekend. A . worker at The Smith near Lincoln Center was left $3,500, while another . at NoMad in the Flatiron District got $7,000. It . has previously been speculated that Mr Selby, who became a . multimillionaire when PayPal was sold to eBay, was the person behind . Tips For Jesus. The . 39-year-old businessman is believed to have handed out tens of thousands . of dollars in tips in the past three months at cafes and clubs from . Michigan to California. Mr Selby was among a small group of alumni who made a fortune at PayPal, and since leaving the firm has dabbled in film production, venture capitalism and now, according to his Facebook, he's opened a dry-cleaning business. While he hasn't officially revealed himself anywhere since the story went viral, he posted a link to an article about one generous gratuity on his page. And his Facebook friends appear to be in on the charitable scheme. One, Anne Woolway, commented: 'Do we win if we know whom is behind tipsforjesus?' Another, Rob Hughes, added: 'and the mystery tipper strikes again...' Mr Kinney, 67, who waits tables at the French Quarter restaurant in West Hollywood, said that he had no idea that the huge tip was serious and it would have been useful for his retirement . Mr Selby also owns homes in all the states where tips were received, including multiple residences in Arizona and California. Last year, Mr Selby started a company Incognito Pictures with the aim to make movies for a budget of $10 million or less. He secured $50million in financing for the project and entered into a long-term distribution deal with The Weinstein Company.

"Facebook billionaire Sean Parker has been slapped with a $2.5 million penalty after he failed to get the proper permits for his 'Game of Thrones' style Big Sur wedding. The California Coastal Commission and Parker said they have reached a settlement to pay for coastal conservation programs after the Napster co-founder built a large movie-set like wedding site in an ecologically sensitive area of Big Sur. Officials were tipped off about Parker's lavish $10 million wedding, which saw him build a cottage, fake ruins, waterfalls, staircases and a huge dance floor near iconic redwoods and a stream with threatened steelhead trout, when neighbors complained. The complaints prompted a county investigation into the construction at a closed campground owned by Ventana Inn & Spa. The Ventana is negotiating a separate settlement for allowing the construction to occur. Expensive wedding: Former Facebook president and Napster co-founder Sean Parker, right, has been fined $2.5 million after his $10 million wedding on Saturday . Ahead of the big day: One guest snapped a photograph of the rehearsal dinner the night before . The Ventana is located within the . coastal zone, an area regulated by the commission, an independent state . agency that oversees coastal development. Any significant construction . within the zone has to be permitted. When staff inspected, they found the temporary structures had already been built, but allowed the wedding to proceed anyway. The commission started negotiating a . settlement with Parker and his representatives for the violations . instead of shutting the event down. 'Mr. Parker has been extremely . cooperative and actively involved in working with Coastal Commission . staff to reach this resolution which both addresses our Coastal Act . concerns and will result in greater coastal access and conservation in . the Big Sur and Monterey Peninsula areas,' Charles Lester, the . commission's executive director, said in a statement. Parker, 33, the former president of . Facebook who was portrayed by Justin Timberlake in the movie 'The Social . Network,' married singer-songwriter Alexandra Lenas on Saturday in a . ceremony with gowns and sets made by a designer for the 'Lord of the . Rings' films. Since Parker did not get permits for . the construction, commission staff will oversee the breakdown of the . vast set so no damage is done to the environment. The commission said no . major damage had yet been done, but it wanted to reach a deal quickly . so the violating structures could be removed safely. Lovebirds: Sean Parker and Alexandra Lenas (pictured at the Charity Water gala in October 2012) said 'I Do' on Saturday before 300 guests at Big Sur .

Money from the agreement may be used . to purchase public easements and hiking trails in the Big Sur area and . as grants for nonprofits doing conservation projects. Also, as part of the settlement, . Parker will have to produce and distribute a public education video or . create a mobile app aimed at helping to identify areas where the public . can access the coast. Haage said the commission is hopeful . Parker's assistance will help it spread more information about . California's coastal resources. Parker said he was delighted to help. 'We always dreamed of getting married . in Big Sur, one of the most magical places on Earth,' Parker said in a . statement. 'In continuing my foundation's mission, we are excited to . support these important conservation-related projects for and with the . local community.'

"Serious girlfriend: Alex McNear was Mr Obama's first serious girlfriend; the two began dating after they met at Occidental College . This is the woman who was Barack Obama’s first serious girlfriend, MailOnline can exclusively reveal. Alex McNear is a mother-of-one who runs a green energy company and lives in a $2million mansion in Sag Harbor, New York. She is also a Democrat who is understood to have voted for Mr Obama in the 2008 election. This week it emerged that she won the heart of the future president whilst at college, but until now the story of what happened next to her has not been told. Rather than moving into the White House she wed a rather less glamorous compensation prize - a Serbian boxer who once tried to rob $60,000 from a bank. Miss McNear married Bob Bozic in a ceremony which appalled her mother and brought a former vagrant and one time bookmaker into their upper middle class family. Mr Obama meanwhile romanced his second love Genevieve Cook before meeting Michelle Obama and marrying her - and becoming leader of the Free World. In her first comments since the story broke, Miss McNear told MailOnline: 'I am not giving any interviews. 'I did that one interview with David Maraniss for reasons I won't go into. 'I have nothing more to say about the whole subject'. Asked if she would go on a date with Mr Obama if he got back in touch with her, Miss McNear said 'goodbye' and hung up the phone. Miss McNear was named for the first time this week as the first person Mr Obama fell for in extracts from a forthcoming biopic about the president by author David Maraniss. She told how the two met at Occidental College in California and had a summer romance at the age of 20 in New York in 1981 when he transferred to Columbia to finish his studies. First love: McNear said she met Mr Obama at Occidental College in California and had a summer romance at the age of 20 in New York in 1981 when he transferred to Columbia to finish his studies . Former flame: Miss McNear, circled, was a literary type from a waspish family who was seduced by Mr Obama's intellectual musings on T.S. Eliot . The story of what happened next however is equally extraordinary - how a woman who could have been the First Lady ended up with a prize fighter whose claim to fame is losing a 1973 bout with boxer Larry Holmes at Madison Square Garden. On the face of it, Miss McNear and Mr Bozic made an extremely unlikely pair, even if her mother Suzanne was fiction editor at Playboy in the 1960s and 70s. Miss McNear was a literary type from a waspish family who was seduced by Mr Obama's intellectual musings on T.S. Eliot. Burly Mr Bozic however spent part of his youth struggling to survive on the streets of Toronto having run away from home. He was so desperate he would spend his nights sleeping in Laundromats or parked cars and spend his days stealing to makes ends meet. But love found a way, and in 1987 they got married, and stayed together for seven years, but then divorced. The boxer: Ms McNear married Bob Bozic in 1987; he famously lost to boxer Larry Holmes at Madison Square Garden in 1973 . New vocation: Bozic now works at the world-famous Fanelli Cafe in SoHo . They had a daughter together, Vesna, now 20, an aspiring actress who lives in Manhattan and remain close to this day. In a frank assessment of his function in Miss McNear's life, Mr Bozic has said she married him to 'separate' herself from her family. And it was not hard to see why. According to a profile in the New Yorker magazine, he was everything her life was not. The working class son of an engineer, Mr Bozic got into boxing when the owner of a gym in Toronto took pity on him and gave him a meal every day, making him stay around long enough to get interested in fighting. In time he became the Canadian national amateur heavyweight champion but went into semi-retirement when he began to lose and travelled around Europe, stopping in Ibiza and Sweden. His most serious brush with the law came in 1980 when he was broke and in a bad mental place -  supposedly he was sent over the edge when faced with going to the opera on his own. World-renowned: Fanelli's Cafe in SoHo has been serving drinks since 1922 and is one of New York's oldest continuously-serving bars . Current partner: McNear is now with Dr Robby Stein, a child psychologist; they live in Sag Harbor . Mr Bozic then walked into a branch of the Manufacturers Hanover bank in Manhattan and told them than men outside had guns pointed at the bank. He asked for $60,000 and was taken to the vault before the police arrested him. He was given a lenient sentence of probation after admitting robbery in the third degree. It was after this that he met Miss McNear whilst working as a bouncer at a transvestite club in New York, a job he had only taken to try and keep the judge in his court case happy. She was working as a lawyer in Chicago at the time phoned up the club asking for a place to hold a benefit night. He told her his life story and, against all odds, they began to fall for each other. Happy golden years: Mr Obama is pictured with his grandparents, Stanley and Madelyn Dunham on a park bench outside of New York's Central Park, when Obama was a student at Columbia . Family ties: Mr Obama pictured with his father, Barack Obama Sr, in a family photo from the 1960s, left; Mr Obama's ex-girlfriends were interviewed by author David Maraniss, who is releasing a book on the President . Mr Bozic, 61, now works as a barman in New York, a far cry from the affluent lifestyle of his ex-wife. Miss McNear, 51, runs renewable energy company GreenLogic in Southampton, New York. Her long term partner is Robert Stein, in his 60s, a child psychologist and their home is on a leafy street in Sag Harbor, which is close the millionaire’s playground of The Hamptons. They two are heavily involved in community affairs and Mr Stein is a member of the village board. Miss McNear has also worked as a journalist and has written for the local paper the East Hampton Star and attended numerous meetings on zoning issues and developments in the area. In the extracts of Mr Obama's biography it was his second girlfriend Miss Cook who had harsh words of criticism for him. But according to the New Yorker piece, Miss McNear also has a sharp tongue when it comes to men. She once said of Mr Bozic: 'Bob is fascinated and appalled by Wasps' - but he still married her. Speaking from Fanelli’s Bar where he works Mr Bozic said: 'I love my ex-wife and I'm very close to her so I'm not going to be able to say anything.' Asked if he knew the extracts were being made public he said: 'Yes, but she (Miss McNear) didn't know this was going to happen. First couple: Mr Obama went on to date Genevieve Cook before he eventually met and married Michelle . 'She didn't know it was going to be like this. She is extremely private and very shy.’ He declined to comment on how he felt about being the man who beat Mr Obama for his ex-wife's affections. Mr Stein said that he and Miss McNear both wanted to ‘put this behind us and get on with our lives’. Asked . whether or not she had told him the extracts about her relationship . with Mr Obama were going to be published before they were made public, . he said: ‘We’re very happy for Mr Obama, we’re happy he’s done so well. I . voted for him’. A friend . of Miss McNear added: 'Alex is so embarrassed about this coming out . right now. She has a family and is a grown up, for her to be called . somebody's 'girlfriend' is really making her cringe. 'It . was all in the past but her family still tease her about it. I know her . sisters say they would have liked to have been in the White House, but . ce la vie. 'To think she could have been First Lady, and she married a boxer instead. You couldn't make it up'. Another ex: Cook, seen her at college at Swathmore, wrote how Obama loved running and lived in an apartment that smelled of raisins and sweat; she was 25 when they dated .

Touchdown: Kardashian's efforts to break the internet may have been eclipsed by Beckham Jr's catch .

"The new prosecutor in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann is 'determined' to solve the child's disappearance . A new Portuguese prosecutor has been charged with solving the disappearance of Madeleine McCann seven years after the British child vanished from her holiday apartment. Ines Sequeira will lead the investigation into the case as Scotland Yard prepares to return to Praia da Luz to 're-interview' three suspects. Ms Sequeira is said to be 'utterly determined' to solve the case, bringing fresh hope to the child's parents, Kate and Gerry McCann. 'Ines is still trying to get her feet under the table and is having to be briefed on scores of cases including Madeleine’s,' a source close to the investigation said. 'But she has been appointed as the new prosecutor and the Scotland Yard team has been given renewed hope of being able to start work again in Portugal before the end of the month. 'Ms Sequeira is one of the sharpest and most ambitious prosecutors in Portugal. 'She is utterly determined to get a result on the Madeleine inquiry.' It comes after British police sent a fifth letter to Portuguese officers requesting access to the investigation. 'They’re banking on this new meeting with Portuguese police being their chance to argue their case face-to-face,' the source added. 'Ines will obviously take the final decision on the letter but she’ll consult the police chiefs on the Algarve before making her mind up.' Her appointment comes after the public prosecutor's position was left empty for almost a month following the departure of Jose Magalhes e Menezes. Scotland Yard officers are due to fly to Portugal next week to re-interview three of seven suspects previously questioned in Faro police stations. Among them are Jose Carlos Fernandes da Silva, an ex-worker at the Ocean Club resort, Paulo Ribeiro, who looks like a man seen near the apartment, and charity collector Ricardo Rodrigues. The appointment of Ms Sequeira has brought fresh hope to Madeleine's parents, Kate and Gerry McCann (pictured) British Police efforts to find the child such as digs and sewer searches were previously dismissed by Portuguese police as 'senseless' Portuguese officers asserted in the past the culprit was foreign and had left the country . It comes after a woman, accused of sending hateful messages to Kate and Gerry McCann online, committed suicide after being confronted. An inquest into the death of Brenda Leyland, who allegedly 'trolled' the couple on Twitter, is ongoing. Madeleine McCann vanished from the room she was sharing with her younger twin siblings while her parents were eating dinner in a restaurant in the resort in May 2007. Several men, including a Cape Verde immigrant and heroin addict who died in 2009 following a tractor incident, have been considered as suspects but no one has been charged over the child’s disappearance. Previously Portuguese police dismissed British investigator's methods as 'senseless', asserting Madeleine's kidnapper was foreign and no longer in the country. The family were staying at The Ocean Club resort (pictured) when Madeleine vanished in May 2007 without a trace .","Ines Sequeira has been chosen as new Portuguese Public Prosecutor .

"The devastated father of a 12-year-old boy who was shot dead by Cleveland police when he allegedly pulled out a BB gun from his waistband has condemned the officers for their actions. Gregory Henderson, whose son, Tamir Rice, passed away in hospital on Sunday, said the youngster had his whole life ahead of him when he was gunned down outside Cudell Recreation Center. Wiping away tears, he said: 'Who would've thought he would go so soon? He had his whole life ahead. To be 12 years old, he doesn't know what he's doing. Police, they know what they're doing.' He added that he was still shocked at the death of his 'superhero', whom he described as a keen basketball player who was tall for his size, polite and 'very artistic'. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Tragic: Tamir Rice (pictured in a Facebook photo), 12, was shot dead by police when he allegedly reached into his waistband and pulled out a BB gun outside a recreation center in Cleveland, Ohio, on Saturday afternoon . Shooting: On Sunday, Tamir's father, Gregory Henderson,said the youngster had his whole life ahead of him when he was gunned down outside Cudell Recreation Center. Above, the BB gun that Tamir was carrying . Scene: Wiping away tears, he said: 'He had his whole life ahead. To be 12 years old, he doesn't know what he's doing. Police, they know what they're doing.' Above, investigators are pictured at the scene of the shooting . 'I'm trying not to cry about the situation but the situation hurts,' he told WKYC.com, adding that he wished police had Tasered his son instead of immediately shooting him. Tamir, who was formally identified by officials on Sunday afternoon, was spotted 'waving around' the airsoft gun at a playground next to the Ohio recreation center at 3.30pm last Saturday. A concerned man, who was sitting nearby, called 911 and told the dispatcher: 'I’m sitting in the park…there’s a guy here with a pistol, and it’s probably a fake one, but he’s pointing it at everybody. 'The guy keeps pulling it in and out…it’s probably fake, but he’s scaring the s*** out of people.' Minutes later, two Cleveland Police officers - a rookie and a 10-15 year veteran - arrived at the scene, where they apparently saw Tamir pick up the gun from a table and put it in his waistband. The rookie then asked the boy to put his hands up, at which point the youngster reached into his waistband and pulled out the pistol,  Police Patrolmen's Association President Jeffrey Follmer said. Too young: Mr Henderson added that he was distraught over the death of his 'superhero', Tamir (pictured), whom he described as a keen basketball player who was tall for his size, polite and 'very artistic' Distraught: 'I'm trying not to cry about the situation but the situation hurts,' he told WKYC.com. Above, Mr Henderson - who did not wish for his face to be revealed - speaks to reporters following his son's death . Despite the 911 caller's prior warning that the gun was likely fake, the officer then fired two shots at Tamir, at least one of which hit him in the stomach, according to Cleveland.com. Following the shooting, the boy was taken to MetroHealth Medical Center in serious condition, but his condition deteriorated throughout the night and he died on Sunday morning. Police later told Fox 8 the weapon Tamir was carrying was 'an airsoft type replica gun resembling a semi-automatic pistol.' They added that the gun's orange safety indicator had been removed. Union officials claimed the officers - one of whom was later taken to hospital with an ankle injury - acted responsibly amid concerns the boy was in possession of a real gun. However, Deputy Chief of Field Operations Ed Tomba described the incident as 'very, very tragic', saying that the child did not threaten the officer verbally or physically. 'When an officer gives a command, we expect it to be followed,' Mr Tomba said. 'The way it looks like right now, it wasn't followed, but we're going to continue our investigation.' On Sunday, Tamir's family and friends - some of whom had been holding a vigil at the hospital for the youngster - were spotted bringing posters, candles and teddy bears to the area. 'I went to church today and I said a prayer for him and, as soon as I come home, he's dead,' said Kerby Williams, who lives near the scene of the shooting. Members of the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor’s Office were also spotted outside the recreation center. Investigators will determine if the officer was justified in shooting the boy. Distraught: One of Tamir's relatives is pictured weeping on the ground after hearing of Saturday's shooting . Scene: A concerned bystander called 911 and told the dispatcher: 'I’m sitting in the park…there’s a guy in here with a pistol, and it’s probably a fake one, but he’s pointing it at everybody.' Above, Cuddell Recreation Center . Tamir was named by the Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner's Office on Sunday afternoon as the boy's family hired attorney Tim Kucharski to represent them in the upcoming investigation. Mr Kucharski, of Richardson & Kurcharski, told WKYC an 'innocent boy was shot and killed', saying: 'Apparently, listening to the 911 call...the caller... recognized that this was a toy gun. 'I'm not sure how police weren't able to make that same decision. We're going to conduct our own parallel investigation' He added: I understand what police are putting out there, I cannot confirm or deny those facts. The family is absolutely is devastated. He was a wonderful young man.' On Sunday, Donnie Pastard, an activist with the anti-crime group Black on Black, said: 'I do not think these police officers left home to kill a black child. But I do think there's training involved there.' Response: Two Cleveland Police officers arrived at the scene following the 911 call. After the boy refused to put his hands up and reached for the gun (pictured from another perspective), one officer fired at him twice . 'There's the race factor involved. This is something we gonna have to talk about, whether we like it or not,' Mr Pastard told Action News 19. But a 14-year-old who was outside the recreation center when the shooting occurred said he understood why police shot Tamir, saying: 'It could have been prevented by him going home.' Mr Kucharski added: 'This is not a black and white issue. This is a right and wrong issue. This is not a racial issue. This is about people doing their jobs the right way.' According to Tamir's mother, Samaria Rice, the family lives across the street from the center. She told the news station the first she heard of the shooting was when two  men came to her home to say her son had been shot. She added that Tamir did not have access to a gun at the property. Both officers involved  have been placed on administrative leave in accordance with protocol in officer-involved shooting incidents. Ohio lawmakers have reportedly acted following Tamir's shooting, with Rep Alicia Reece, of Cincinnati, announcing new legislation on BB and airsoft guns. Under the new rules, all such weapons sold in Ohio would have to be brightly colored or feature prominent florescent strips so they could not be confused with real firearms. Current federal law states all toy and replica guns must have an orange tip on the barrel. An investigation is ongoing.","Gregory Henderson spoke out hours after his son, Tamir Rice, 12, died .

"Lenny Harper (pictured) fears the details of child abuse victims may have been leaked . The details of hundreds of child abuse victims may have been leaked after officials failed to post sensitive documents securely, a former senior investigator fears. The year-long inquiry into historic claims that children were molested in care homes in Jersey is currently under way. Police have taken 1,776 statements in connection with 532 offences - with the 191 victims all entitled to anonymity. But former Jersey police chief, Lenny Harper, fears their details may have been accidentally leaked after a confidential document posted to him by inquiry officials arrived in an opened envelope. Mr Harper, who looked into reports of child abuse on the island in 2007 and 2008, said the Jersey Care Inquiry sent him the 200-page document to sign, but failed to send it by recorded delivery. He said the post office in the UK had resealed the package in a plastic bag because it had been damaged and inserted a letter of apology for the condition. Mr Harper has given evidence at the inquiry into reports of abuse in the island's children's homes and fostering services and said the document had contained 'the most sensitive information'. Former Jersey police chief, Lenny Harper, outside the Haut de la Garenne care home, which shut in 1986 . Many victims were targeted in the Haut de la Garenne care home which closed in 1986. He said: 'There are details of alleged abusers, there are details of many victims and what victims were saying happened to them. 'There are details of allegations of corrupt behaviour by officials in Jersey and many other details of a sensitive nature. 'It could cause a lot of distress to a lot of people. 'My main concern obviously would be the victims who gave accounts of what had happened to them in confidence at that time.' The Jersey Care Inquiry said in response to Mr Harper's claims that it has 'deliberately chosen not to draw attention to post'. In a statement on their website, it says: 'The Inquiry is in contact with a wide range of witnesses, some of whom are on the island and some are not. 'Much of our contact with witnesses is by telephone or electronic, but sometimes it is necessary to send documentation through the post, particularly to witnesses who are not on the island. 'The Inquiry has deliberately chosen not to draw attention to post, which is sent in plain, non branded envelopes or plastic document bags in the normal post. 'The Inquiry by necessity has to use the postal service on the island. 'The Inquiry views with concern the reports from Mr Harper that his private mail has possibly been tampered with and has been in contact with Mr Harper.'","Former Jersey police chief Lenny Harper fears details of child abuse victims may have been leaked .

"The Gowanus Canal, long recognized for its extensive pollution, has been captured in a series of abstract photographs, offering a new perspective. Though photographer Steven Hirsch was raised in Brooklyn, it wasn't until 2010 he saw the canal with his own eyes, he told ABC in 2011. 'It was shocking and sad to see a waterway that should be teeming with life has become so polluted and such a blight to the community,' Hirsch told the channel. 'I can only imagine its horrendous condition in its heyday as an industrial center. I sat by the edge of the canal and made these photographs of the water’s surface on a bright spring day. The smell was so noxious I could only stay 20 minutes.' The photographs were taken off of the water's surface, Hirsch writes on his website. They show fragmented, colored swirls in the canal, making mesmerizing abstract shapes and figures. The Gowanus Canal was completed in the 1800s and used as a major waterway. Over time, the canal suffered from 'years of discharges, storm water runoff, sewer outflows and industrial pollutants,' the EPA says, and known pollutants include PCBs and coal tar wastes. In 2010 the agency added the canal to its list of Superfund sites. The canal was also long-rumored to be a dumping ground for the mafia, the Village Voice notes, and was even nicknamed 'Perfume Creek' and 'Lavender Lake' for its strong odor. Hirsch, who teaches at Pratt Institute, has a number of other art projects available for viewing on his website, including a photo series on Cherry Patch Ranch, an 'abandoned and haunted' Nevada brothel, as well as a portrait series with people who claim to have been abducted by aliens. Abstract: photographer Steven Hirsch has captured images taken off of the surface of the Gowanus Canal . Zig zags: the photographs show various colors seen in the highly-polluted canal . Cleanup: the Gowanus Canal was labelled a Superfund site by the EPA in 2010 . History: the Gowanus Canal was built in the 1800s and used as a waterway for New York City . Mystery: the mafia was even rumoured to use the Gowanus Canal as a dumping ground .

The country's ultra-conservative clergy tried to destroy her ambitions to be Saudi's first female Olympian, before an argument about the type of headscarf she should wear jeopardised her place at the eleventh hour. And though Afghanistan's Kohistani trailed in last in the 100 metres - in a time of 14.42 seconds - the warm appreciation of the London crowd who recognised her historic feat must have been the greatest of feelings. She has suffered months of harassment from men who don't believe women should be permitted to play sport. Both have made a strong statement to the people of their respective countries and the world with their determination to take part and their dignity. As did Noor Hussain Al-Malki, only the fourth female athlete from Qatar to enter the Olympics, who lasted just a dozen strides before pulling up injured in her 100m heat. The record books will show DNF - Did Not Finish - but they were significant strides. Shinoona Salah Al-Habsi of Oman and Sulaiman Fatima Dahman from Yemen are unlikely to trouble the favourites for gold, but as they sprinted down the track in the Olympic Stadium wearing colourful hijabs there was a sense of progress. The Olympics ended in disappointment for Noor Hussain Al-Malki of Qatar, who pulled up shortly after the start of her 100m heat . Shinoona Salah al-Habsi (Centre) of Oman certainly stood out on the starting blocks with her hijab and top in national colours . Shaherkani, just 16, comes from Saudi Arabia, a country of ultra-Conservatism where women are banned from driving and cannot leave the house without a male chaperone, let alone compete in the biggest sporting event in the world in front of millions around the world. She had been rocked by the barbs of the country's clergy, who strongly discourage female participation in sport in any form and labelled her the 'Prostitute of the Olympics.' Her family have been bombarded with racial abuse, according to reports, with many trying to claim Shaherkani did not represent their country. There was then a row which threatened to end her chances once and for all. Her national Olympic Committee said she could only compete if she was wearing a hijab - a hair covering worn by many Muslim women. But judo's governing body was worried that a head covering could be dangerous in the grapples and tumbles of the sport. Shaherkani, Saudi Arabia's first ever female athlete, squares up to Puerto Rican Melissa Mojica in their first round bout, which lasted just over a minute . Kohistani looks at the scoreboard after her 100m heat, though her time of 14.42 seconds meant she finished last in the standings . Shaherkani was powerless - a political pawn - as negotiations went backwards and forwards between the two until a compromise was reached. And so she strode out - a little tentatively but energised by cheers from the British crowd as loud as any reserved for home athletes - wearing a tightly-wrapped black headscarf. But there was another problem - Shaherkani is only a blue belt, two below her opponent Melissa Mojica, and the outcome was inevitable. A little later, Kohistani lined up in heat four of the women's 100 metres. Alongside her were competitors from Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu, Micronesia, Cape Verde and San Marino - countries smaller than Afghanistan but light years ahead in terms of sporting equality. The 23-year-old raced in a headscarf in the national colours of red, green and black, and a rather impractical outfit of long-sleeved top and jogging bottoms. But the wall of noise Kohistani experienced in the Olympic Stadium was in stark contrast to the whistling and heckling she received on a daily basis from dozens of men while training at the stadium in Kabul. They would shout 'Just be in your house' and 'Be behind your man!' as she raced up and down the track, honing her technique. Her coach would often have to quite literally fight his way through the crowds afterwards. Kohistani was warmly received by the crowd at the Olympics Stadium as she lined up for her heat this morning . After the race, she said: 'I faced a lot of challenges in my training for the London Olympics. 'One day I was coming to the stadium and the taxi driver asked me where I was going. I said 'I am training, I am going to London Olympics' and he said 'get out of the cab, I don't want to take you there'. 'Whenever I train there's a lot of people who want to disturb me. They say 'just leave these things, it's not good for Afghan females to do these things'.' Although her time was nearly four seconds slower than Florence Griffith-Joyner's world record of 10.49 seconds, Kohistani had some powerful words to her fellow countrywomen. 'I have a message for the women of Afghanistan. Come and join Tahmina because I need your support. 'We must be ready for the next Olympics, we should have more athletes in the next Olympics. I'm going to do my best to be in Brazil, I am going to give reason for other athletes to follow my way.' It wasn't so good for Al-Malki, Qatar's first female Olympian, whose hours and hours of training and preparation resulted in just a couple of seconds in the Olympic spotlight. Wearing a maroon headscarf, long sleeves and leggings, she stood out among the starters. She was slow out of the blocks, appeared to be very tight, and finally clutched at her right leg before stopping after about 15m. It was a similar story for the others, who weren't close to qualifying for the next round. Contrasting cultures: Oman's Shinoona Salah al-Habsi (Left) and Yemen's Fatima Sulaiman Dahman walk off the track with Andorra's Cristina Llovera . But as IOC spokesman Mark Adams said: 'If someone's injured then they are injured. She is here and she is competing. That is what matters. 'I think we should be celebrating today because we had two athletes from two of three countries who had never sent women athletes to the Games.' Last but not least: Somalia's Zamzam Mohamed Farah crosses the finish line of a women's 400-meter heat . They say it’s the taking part that counts. In . which case, Somalian runner Zamzam Mohamed Farah did her country proud . in the women’s 400m yesterday – even though she finished nearly half a . minute after the winner. Zamzam, . 21, is one of only two Somalian athletes at the Games – each nation is . eligible for two guaranteed places, one male, one female – and she was . her country’s proud flag-bearer at the opening ceremony. Yesterday, . dressed in a Muslim-suitable track outfit designed to cover most of her . body, she gamely took on some of the best in the world – and lost. Winner . Francena McCorory  (US) finished first in 50.78 seconds. Zamzam came . last with a time of 1min 20.48sec, with the next-to-last competitor a . good 25 seconds ahead of her. Many . in the crowd at the Olympic stadium appeared to assume the race was . over, not realising that Zamzam had yet to amble across the finish line. But . her performance didn’t go unnoticed on the internet, where she became . the subject of ridicule, in some cases, and admiration in others. One wrote: ‘Can I just give a big shout to Zamzam Farah for being my favorite Somali woman ever.’ But another said: ‘Zamzam, you cannot run! You suck.’ Somalia’s determined Olympic hopefuls have overcome challenges in their war-torn country that few other athletes encounter. Training facilities are virtually non-existent and those that do operate are often pock-marked with bullet-holes. A . Somali Athletics Federation official said recently: ‘The security . situation has hampered our efforts, and the resources we have had to . prepare the athletes were unspeakable. ‘But I can assure you that our athletes are strong in spirit.’ Zamzam . wasn’t the only 400m runner to fail to break the one-minute barrier . yesterday. Djibouti’s Zourah Ali finished in 1min 5.37sec, while . Macedonia’s Hristina Risteska clocked 1min 0.86sec.","Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Brunei have all entered women athletes into the 2012 Olympic Games for the first time .

"A former senior psychologist with the NYPD has been arrested and charged with trying to kill her husband last year during a staged home invasion. Mother-of-two Emily Dearden, 46, from Yonkers, New York, turned herself in after her spouse Kenneth, 47, filed a lawsuit earlier this month claiming she shot him in the back of the head in November, 2013, 'execution-style' so she could be with her married lover. She was charged with attempted second degree murder during an arraignment hearing on Friday where she posted $150,000 bail and was ordered to stay away from her husband. On November 14 last year, real estate developer Mr Dearden was found with gunshot wounds at his large home in the well-to-do area where the couple lived with their two daughters. Court papers said he woke up with a 'searing pain in his jaw' before noticing the bed sheets were covered in blood. Emily Dearden, 46, has been charged with second degree attempted murder after her husband Kenneth, 47, filed a lawsuit claiming she tried to kill him so she could run off with her married lover . Dearden handed herself in to authorities last week following the shooting at their $500,000 Yonkers, New York, home last year (left). Her latest mugshot is pictured right . The couple, pictured with their daughters, on a family vacation. Mr Dearden  claimed in a restraining order lawsuit that his wife tried to kill him in a staged home invasion . Mr Dearden then found his wife on the floor downstairs, claiming she had been hit in the head by an intruder. He also realized that the home's alarm he had set hours before had been turned off and only his wife knew the code. Mitchell Schuster, Mr Dearden's lawyer, told The Journal News that his client understands why it has taken so long for charges to be filed and is continuing to cooperate with detectives. He told the paper: 'We were always confident the authorities would go through the process and take the steps necessary to ensure an arrest. We're happy with the results so far.' Her lover was named as Warren Roudebush, of Texas, who allegedly ended his own marriage, according to court documents seen by The New York Post. Calls to Mr Roudebush's home went unanswered on Friday. According to the Supreme Court lawsuit: 'With [Kenneth] no longer in the picture, [Emily] could avoid a contentious divorce, keep the marital home and never admit the marriage infidelity to any family and friends.' No one has been charged in the shooting at the home, worth more than $500,000 according to records, where the couple live with their young daughters. Calls to the Dearden family home were not answered on Friday. Authorities investigating the property developer's home in Yonkers last year after Mr Dearden was shot in the head and alerted authorities. His wife was on the floor of the property claiming she had been hit by an intruder . According to Lohud.com, Mrs Dearden filed for divorce in August. The Westchester District Attorney's Office was unable to comment due to an ongoing criminal investigation. In a CBS report from November 2013, Mr Dearden was alert and talking when paramedics arrived at his home after he called 911. Detectives at the time did not believe that his injury was self-inflicted. A dog, believed to be the family's Rottweiler, did not react during an alleged home invasion last year . His wife, Emily, an NYPD psychologist was treated at the scene for a minor head wound. Mr Rearden's lawsuit reportedly said that his wife claimed she had been 'knocked out' by an intruder. During the home invasion, according to the lawsuit seen by The Post, the family's alarm didn't go off and the alleged intruder didn't set off the pet Rottweiler. Mr Dearden's lawsuit also reportedly claimed that his wife refused medical treatment and washed the bed sheets and her nightgown while he was in hospital. He also reportedly claimed that his wife met her lover for coffee the next morning. Police would not say who fired the weapon or if it was an accident or a crime. Emily Dearden was questioned last November but not charged. Mrs Dearden is also a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan. MailOnline was awaiting a comment from Emily Dearden's lawyer, Paul B. Bergman, on Friday. Yonkers police Lt. Patrick McCormack told The Post that the case was 'complex'. MailOnline was awaiting a response from Yonkers police on Friday. Meister Seelig & Fein, listed as Mr Dearden's attorneys on court documents, were unavailable for comment when contacted by MailOnline on Friday. Mr Dearden, who is originally from Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, is President for Development at real estate company, Metro Partners and is also President of the Yonkers Downtown/Waterfront Business Improvement District. Metro Partners website lists him as a former investment banker at JPMorgan Chase. Mr Dearden filed a temporary restraining order against his wife earlier this month where he made explosive allegations that she had been the one to shoot him last year .","Kenneth Dearden Jr, 47, filed a lawsuit claiming wife Emily, 46, shot him in November 2013 'execution-style'

"A former NBC employee who says he used to keep guard outside Bill Cosby's door after teenage models were taken to his dressing room has spoken out about his shame. Frank Scotti, who has also claimed that he funneled thousands of dollars to women the star favored, said some of the visitors were as young as 16. 'I felt like a pimp,' Scotti, now 90, told the Today show on Monday. 'I felt dirty.' He said he decided to come forward now after 18 women stepped forward to accuse Cosby of inappropriate behavior - from unwelcome advances to drugging and rape. Scroll down for videos . Secret shame: Frank Scotti said he waited outside Cosby's dressing room after girls as young as 16 visited him during the filming of The Cosby Show. He spoke out after multiple women accused the star of rape . Old friends: Scotti, pictured right, claims he worked as NBC's 'fixer' for the comedian for years . Scotti said he feels sorry for the women. 'I just felt he's not the person I thought he was,' he said. Scotti first spoke to the New York Daily News about his relationship to the comedian, claiming he spent years as NBC's 'fixer' for Cosby, funneling thousands of dollars to his virtual harem of women as The Cosby Show was being filmed. 'He had everybody fooled,' said Scotti. He eventually walked away from the star because of how he treated women, he said. The NBC veteran said Cosby had a rotating lineup of young women brought to his Brooklyn dressing room by a complicit modeling agency in Manhattan. Old friends: Scotti, pictured with Tom Selleck and Cosby, said he also paid off women Cosby especially liked . Thankful: Pictured, a signed image Cosby gave to Scotti - who eventually quit over how the star treated women . Scotti said the Manhattan agency's owner would lead the girls there and leave once Cosby picked his chosen lady. 'She knew exactly what was going to go on,' Scotti told the News. 'Then he'd tell me, ""Stand outside the door and don't let anyone in."" Now you put that together and figure (out) why.' According to Scotti, some of the girls were as young as 16. Scotti claims Cosby would put women he especially liked up in apartments and give them up to $2,000 per month. After decades, Scotti has even saved receipts from money orders he says he gave those women for Cosby. One of those women, Shawn Thompson, had a daughter named Autumn Jackson who would claim Cosby was her father. The money orders, though, are in Scotti's name and not Cosby's. Beloved: Despite threats of protests, Cosby received standing ovations during shows this weekend (pictured) Halcyon days: Scotti worked with Cosby during his time on The Cosby Show (pictured) in the 80s and 90s . 'I did a lot of crazy things for him,' Scotti told the Daily News. 'He was covering himself by having my name on it. It was a coverup. I realized it later.' And when he did, Scotti said he had to walk away. 'You've got all of these kids, every time,' he told the Daily News. 'I used to like him, but that's the reason I quit him after so many years — because of the girls.' In recent weeks, at least seven women have publicly accused the 77-year-old Cosby of sexual assault years ago. Cosby has not been charged in connection with any of the allegations. Only one woman has filed suit - Andrea Constand, who sued in 2005 and settled for an undisclosed amount before the case went to trial. Models: Model Janice Dickinson, here in a file photo, is one of several women who claim they were raped by Cosby. Scotti claims the actor once had a deal with a Manhattan modeling agency, who delivered young women to his dressing room door . Cosby's attorney, Martin Singer, has criticized previous 'decades-old discredited allegations' and denied some others. He suggested in a Friday statement that Cosby's accusers may have another agenda. 'There has never been a shortage of lawyers willing to represent people with claims against rich, powerful men, so it makes no sense that not one of these new women who just came forward for the first time now ever asserted a legal claim back at the time they allege they had been sexually assaulted.' A statement issued Friday by Bill Cosby's lawyer, Martin Singer, in response to allegations of sexual assault against the comic: . 'The new, never-before-heard claims from women who have come forward in the past two weeks with unsubstantiated, fantastical stories about things they say occurred 30, 40, or even 50 years ago have escalated far past the point of absurdity. These brand new claims about alleged decades-old events are becoming increasingly ridiculous, and it is completely illogical that so many people would have said nothing, done nothing, and made no reports to law enforcement or asserted civil claims if they thought they had been assaulted over a span of so many years. Lawsuits are filed against people in the public eye every day. There has never been a shortage of lawyers willing to represent people with claims against rich, powerful men, so it makes no sense that not one of these new women who just came forward for the first time now ever asserted a legal claim back at the time they allege they had been sexually assaulted. This situation is an unprecedented example of the media's breakneck rush to run stories without any corroboration or adherence to traditional journalistic standards. Over and over again, we have refuted these new unsubstantiated stories with documentary evidence, only to have a new uncorroborated story crop up out of the woodwork. When will it end? It is long past time for this media vilification of Mr. Cosby to stop.' See below for video .

"Residents in Buffalo, New York are bracing for massive flooding today as seven feet of snow that was dumped on the area last week begins to melt. Families packed up their valuables and schools canceled classes as temperatures were expected to reach nearly 60 degrees on Monday, sparking possible flooding due to melting snow and overflowing creeks. 'Hopefully the rain won't be here until later and this will be a slow thaw, but flooding is our major, major concern here,' said Michelle Pikula, whose house is along the Buffalo Creek. Scroll down for video . Getting ready: Larry Miceli carries sandbags as he prepares his house for possible flooding following a massive snow storm in West Seneca as the area around Buffalo, New York braced for potential flooding .

Snowed in: A dump truck unloads snow that was removed from south Buffalo on Sunday following last week's massive snowstorm. Now forecasters have warned of massive flooding as the snow melts . The National Weather Service has issued a flood warning for Monday and cautioned that trees weakened by heavy snowfall and saturated soil could come crashing down. High wind gusts of up to 60 mph also could topple electrical wires and trigger power outages. Forecasts call for rain showers on Monday and a chance of rain and snow showers by early Tuesday. Governor Andrew Cuomo Sunday warned residents in flood-prone areas around Buffalo to move valuables up from the basement, pack a bag and prepare for the possibility of evacuation.

Most snow-affected school districts remain closed on Monday, and at least four called off classes for the entire Thanksgiving week. In Hamburg, Pete Yeskoot bought a portable generator to make sure his sump pump will keep working once the roughly 80 inches of snow that fell on his property melts. Possessions are up on blocks in the basement and he has food for several days.

"He was the UK's favourite TV star, loved by millions who tuned into Jim'll Fix It each week, before being exposed as a predatory paedophile following his death in 2011. Now Jimmy Savile's nephew Guy Marsden, 60, has revealed that he came within a whisker of being sexually abused himself but was inadvertently saved by his uncle. In 1968, aged 15, he and a group of friends ran away and got the train to London where they were met by two men who invited them back to their flat. Scroll down for video . Lucky escape: Guy Marsden was ensnared by a paedophile ring but was saved from abuse by his uncle . Close shave: Guy Marsden, pictured here aged eight, was also taken to Savile's parties but wasn't abused . Unbeknown to Guy and his friends, the men were part of a paedophile ring and would regularly scour stations in search of vulnerable youngsters to abuse. 'I would have said about 30, . rock and roll, with leather jackets and long hair and that,' he remembers. 'And they said: ""Do you want to come to our place and that?"" You’ve . got to try to remember that there were no such thing as perverts. 'There . was but you didn’t hear of them. There weren’t even a name ""paedophile"" out then I don’t think. 'So we just thought oh they like us, you know. So . anyway we ended up going with these back to their flat.' Four days later, Guy's uncle Jimmy arrived at the flat with a group of young children and a vicar in tow. Guy, thinking his uncle had been asked to find him by his family, was horrified. 'I thought that me Uncle Jimmy had caught . me there,' he says. 'I was proper scared, I was terrified if . you want. But now I’m 60, I think he didn’t catch me I caught him.' Guy, who tells his story on TV documentary Crimes That Shook Britain, says he has since worked out what was really going on. 'These people would pick people up from . train stations, as in younger people,' he explains. 'We’d then go to their houses. 'And . then the ones higher up the chain would come to these houses to see who . they’d picked up to take them elsewhere to do whatever they were going . to do with them.' Because his uncle was Jimmy Savile, Guy thinks word quickly spread that this was one child not to be touched. 'When I think back I cringe because I . think you could have ended up in the bottom of the Thames,' he confesses. 'I . think it’s only because I was, you know, Jimmy Savile’s nephew, my Uncle . Jimmy’s nephew, that nothing like that did happen.' Others, however, were not so lucky. By the time Savile died aged 84 in October 2011, his victims were estimated to number more than 450. Guy, who has written a book about his experiences, is all too well aware of what went on and says he saw the disgraced star with children during parties at his home. 'I had no conception of paedophilia or . child abuse or anything,' says Guy, who lived with his uncle for a few months when he was 15 along with three friends. 'Neither had any of the other three.  So to us, . our thoughts were, it’s a party. You know the people who live there. 'It ended . up where we were like huddled together, four of us, and then these . little kids would come over to us.' Popular: Thanks to the success of shows like Jim'll Fix It, Savile was once loved by millions of ordinary Britons . Peverted: After his death in 2011, Savile was exposed as a paedophile with at least 450 victims . Although Guy was unaware of what was happening to the children at the time, he regularly saw Savile wander past with groups of children in tow. 'My Uncle Jimmy . didn’t even speak to us or acknowledge us, although every now and again you might . have got a nod. 'He just seemed to come in, flitter about, you know . whatever he were doing - bringing little’uns in and stuff like that and . then he’d go. 'I’ve recently found out that I were going to get ""groomed"" to do what the people down . London were doing - getting the kids and probably older girls and . older boys to go to these parties up here in Leeds and places like that.' 'I think most decent people find it . incomprehensible that these, sort of, organisations, rings, whatever we . want to call them exist but no less incomprehensible than why would . anybody abuse a child,' comments Peter Saunders, Chief Executive of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood. 'The fact that people come together to do it seems . in a way somewhat more scary because very often we’re talking about . people from all walks of life, including those from the upper echelons of society.' By the end of the year, Guy had returned to Leeds, far from his paedophile uncle, and was separated from him further courtesy of a spell in Borstal. When he emerged, it was as a young man ready to start a career and begin a family, both of which he later did. Although he became close to his uncle in later life, even giving a gushing tribute when he died, Guy says he wasn't surprised to hear of his uncle's crimes. ‘Although I wasn't sexually abused I do feel like a victim myself,' he adds. 'I think I should have reported him years ago but I was too scared to do it. Now I am really pleased everyone knows the truth.'

"British aid workers were last night involved in a desperate search for survivors after landslides destroyed a remote town in Afghanistan, killing an estimated 2,100 people. The team from the Department for International Development (DFID) joined forces with United Nations and Red Crescent workers after torrents of mud and earth swept through the town of Aab Barik in Badakshan province in north eastern Afghanistan on Friday. The deadly landslides, which followed days of heavy rain, also left 4,000 people requiring shelter and food. The DFID team is providing the homeless with tents, clean water and medical supplies.

The government was rolling out the new banknote as part of an upgrade of the monetary system. It actually features the Vimy Memorial in northern France, the largest monument overseas for Canadian soldiers lost the First World War. However many Canadians believed the bill showed the Twin Towers and three topless women along with the head of state, Queen Elizabeth II. Scroll down for video . O Canada!

The Vimy Memorial, a nationalist symbol of bravery and sacrifice, was seen on the $20 when it was unveiled by the Bank of Canada in Ottawa last week. Focus groups, typically made up of a wide-range of citizens from different generations, had examined the note before it was made public. According to Upi.com, one focus group member said: 'It's too pornographic. What is the woman on the top holding?' Several reports made public after the five-year consultation period noted this concern along with others under the headline 'potential controversies'. Shocked: An excerpt from a focus group report during the five-year consultation period for Canada's new $20 which called the design 'too pornographic' Some participants in the focus groups were unaware of the wartime memorial honoring thousands of Canadian servicemen, in particular forgotten soldiers with unmarked graves. Symbol: The figures on the statue represent justice and peace - the latter with the torch upraised . Several said the drawing reminded them of the Twin Towers, destroyed in the terrorist attacks on 9/11.

"The body of a woman who had been missing for several days was discovered naked and covered in blood behind a warehouse in South Philadelphia Sunday afternoon. The victim was identified by relatives as Crystal Goodwin, but police have yet to confirm this information, only describing her as a white female between the ages of 35 and 40. The shocking discovery was made just before 2pm in the 1900 block of South Christopher Columbus Boulevard near the Columbus Commons shopping mall. Scroll down for video . Tragic mom: Crystal Goodwin, pictured here with her young daughter in a pool in 2010, was discovered dead and covered in blood outside a warehouse in South Philadelphia Sunday . A man came upon the woman's body lying in the weeds near the shopping center and called police. He said Crystal Goodwin had a large laceration on the right side of her rib cage, according to CBS Philly. A responding paramedic pronounced Goodwin dead at the scene. As of Monday morning, there was no word on the woman's cause of death. According to family members, Miss Goodwin had been battling drug addiction for years, and they are convinced she was murdered. In a tragic twist, Goodwin's family members were on their way to the mall to pick up supplies for Thanksgiving when her body was discovered at 1.38pm dumped near a warehouse. The relatives walked over to the police officers who arrived on the scene and showed them pictures of the missing woman and her tattoos, which turned out to be a match. Just moments after the medical examiner's vehicle had removed Crystal Goodwin's battered body from the scene, her distraught mother pulled up outside the mall. Resting place: A passerby came upon Goodwin's naked body lying in the weeds not far from the Columbus Commons mall . ‘Is it a girl? Is it a girl? Is it my daughter? No, no, don't tell,’ she screamed, according to Philly.com. Lydia Callsen, the mother of Crystal Goodwin's boyfriend, said the couple have a young daughter together. She added that Crystal, who had a long criminal record including theft and drug possession charges, had been released from prison only last Tuesday and disappeared the following day. Investigators have not ruled Goodwin’s death a homicide yet, but her family believe that she was killed as a result of foul play.","Crystal Goodwin's body discovered outside warehouse outside Columbus Commons mall Sunday afternoon .

"Horrifying footage has emerged showing a Malaysian mother repeatedly hitting, kicking and her defenceless ten-month-old daughter. The distressing clip which is just over four minutes in duration has caused fury on the internet, with many users who watched the video labelling the mother as 'sadistic' and 'not fit to be near children.' A friend of the mother, who was 18 at the time of the incident, had become concerned after witnessing her beating the child previously, so filmed the abuse and took the video evidence to the police.

"A review of Britain’s record on human rights was branded ‘ludicrous’ last night – for including criticisms from the governments of Iran, Russia and Cuba. The United Nations report also contains scathing assessments of the UK from other countries notorious for their wholesale denial of human rights – among them Pakistan, Belarus and the Sudan. Russia, where dissent is ruthlessly repressed and opponents of Vladimir Putin’s regime are routinely murdered, attacked police in the UK for using ‘excessive force’ and said prisons here were tantamount to torture. Russian police detain a participant during an opposition rally in St Petersburg on March, 2012 . The Cuban government – which is notorious for locking up dissidents and repressing its opponents – claimed Britain’s public spending cuts were damaging ‘economic and social rights’. The comments were made in a Universal Periodic Review report, an assessment organised by the United Nations’ Human Rights Council. UN General Assembly members are permitted to contribute to the report, which is published on every member state every four years. Critics said the UN was undermining its credibility by allowing nations with serious human rights violations to hijack the process. Andrew Percy, Tory MP for Brigg and Goole, said: ‘This is actually so ridiculous it’s laughable. It is like being lectured by Attila the Hun on the peaceful co-existence of nations. All we need now is Syria to criticise us on our human rights record and the joke would be complete. ‘The UN should be a serious organisation and comments like this damage its credibility both in this country and around the world.’ As part of the review process a delegation including British minister Lord McNally and more than 20 officials went to Geneva last month. He had to endure more than an hour of questioning by delegates from other states on this country’s human rights record. In public comments he was diplomatic, saying this country was ‘proud of its human rights record’ but admitting there was ‘room for improvement’. Among the countries which compiled the draft report was Angola, which has faced criticism from Amnesty International over its treatment of political prisoners. It also included criticism from Algeria and Sudan, on wage differences between men and women in the UK. Russian police officers detain a gay rights activist during an attempt to hold a gay pride parade in Moscow, Russia, in late May 2012 . Police officers carry an anti-Putin protester, who was detained in central Moscow in late May 2012 . But the comments which will provoke most scorn come from Russia, which attacked police in the UK for frequently using ‘excessive force’ to deal with demonstrations, and claimed conditions in British prisons ‘amounted to torture’. Russia is accused of allowing widespread torture by police and security officials and extra-judicial killings. Human rights observers criticised the conditions in which elections were held there in March, with severe restrictions on opponents of president Mr Putin. Belarus, a rogue state run like a Soviet-era autocracy, accused Britain of ‘systematic use of torture’ and attacked the criminal age of responsibility in this country, which it said was too low at ten years old.Cuba’s representative said ‘children, persons with disabilities, women, migrants, minorities and indigenous populations were marginalised and disadvantaged on a daily basis’ in Britain. Write caption here . The Pakistani delegate – from a country where the security services are held responsible for ‘disappearances’ and arbitrary execution –said the Government here ‘should be more proactive in promoting multiculturalism’. Iran, a country which allows execution by stoning and where political dissidents are routinely tortured, called on the UK to better protect religious minorities. Bizarrely, Germany asked that Britain ‘fully recognise the human right to safe drinking’. The UN’s website states that the review process ‘provides the opportunity for each State to declare what actions they have taken to improve the human rights situations in their countries.’ Iran, which routinely hangs people from cranes, and which allows execution by stoning, called on the UK to better protect religious minorities . Philip Davies, Tory MP for Shipley, said: ‘This is absolutely absurd. For them to lecture us on human rights when these countries have some of the most appalling records is breathtaking. It’s turning the UN into a complete joke.’ Earlier this year, the UN’s Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination provoked outrage after it said the eviction of travellers from Dale Farm was ‘disproportionate’. There was fresh criticism last week after it emerged Zimbabwean despot Robert Mugabe had been asked to be a UN ambassador for tourism. The Ministry of Justice said: ‘This process brings international pressure to bear on countries which need to improve human rights. ‘The UK has a very good record and, as we have done already, we will continue to robustly defend this where unwarranted criticism  is made.’ Records of human rights in other countries .","UN report criticised for containing scathing assessments of UK by countries notorious for their denial of human rights .

"The suspect in the 1979 kidnapping of six-year-old Etan Patz in New York will learn today whether his confession can be used at a murder trial. Pedro Hernandez, 53, has pleaded not guilty to killing the boy, who disappeared while walking to his school bus stop in Manhattan, in a case that mystified police for decades. It was only in 2012 that Hernandez, who had been a stock clerk at a store in Etan's neighborhood when the boy disappeared, emerged as a suspect. Pedro Hernandez, who admitted to killing Etan Patz in 1979 in a taped confession, appears in Manhattan criminal court with his attorney Harvey Fishbein in 2012 . After six hours of questioning, he confessed to the kidnapping on video, telling police he lured Etan to the store basement with the promise of a soda and then choked the boy. He described putting the six-year-old, who was still alive, into a plastic bag, then putting the bag inside a box and dumping it nearby. 'I was nervous; my legs were jumping,' Hernandez said. 'I wanted to let go, but I just couldn't let go. I felt like something just took over me. I don't know what to say. Something just took over me, and I was just choking him.' A judge is due to rule, not whether the statements are true, but whether or not the confession can be used as evidence at Hernandez's murder trial. Judge Maxwell Wiley must decide whether Hernandez was properly advised of his rights and is mentally capable of understanding them. Etan became one of the first missing children to be pictured on a milk carton, and the day he disappeared, May 25, became National Missing Children's Day. His body has never been found. 1979 crime: Pedro Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to murder in the strangling death of Etan Patz, who was one of the first missing persons to be placed on a milk carton . On the video, Hernandez is dressed in a brown jacket, white T-shirt and jeans, and sits at an empty desk save for a can of Pepsi. He talks about his family and his medical history - he is HIV-positive, suffers back problems and is bipolar. He explains how he killed the child but doesn't remember what the boy was wearing, that Etan had a cap on when he vanished, or that the weather was bad that day. He says he tossed the boy's book bag behind a freezer; no bag was ever found. He does not remember the boy saying anything, and nothing in particular caught his attention that made him choose the boy, he says. 'I just approached to him or I asked him, you want a soda? I said come with me,' he said. 'He didn't say nothing to me. He didn't kick. He wasn't angry. He just kind of stood there, and I just felt bad what I did.' Etan's parents Stan (left) and Julie Patz. Both were in court the day the confession was heard in September, but Julie left the courtroom before the tape with played . Hernandez's lawyer, Harvey Fishbein, argued his client falsely confessed and lacks the mental ability to understand his rights. He described Hernandez' demeanor on camera as exhausted from hours of questioning; Hernandez had been in custody nearly eight hours when the taping began. 'When those eight hours were finished, he was convinced he had something to do with the disappearance of Etan Patz,' Fishbein said. The Manhattan district attorney's office says the confession was real and legally obtained. In 2012, police got a lead that brought them to Hernandez, a high school dropout who had worked at a corner store near where Etan disappeared. Six-year-old Etan Patz disappeared while walking to his school bus stop in Manhattan in 1979 . Hernandez, most recently a resident of Maple Shade, New Jersey, also told police that he confessed before: to his ex-wife, to a friend, and in front of about 15 people during a prayer circle at a church group. In the 1980s, Hernandez allegedly told the group that he had harmed a child in New York. 'We were all holding hands and praying,' he said of the church meeting. 'And everybody was confessing, so I confessed. I told them I killed a child.' But no one ever went to authorities and investigators have not pointed to any physical or scientific evidence against Hernandez. At about 70, Hernandez's IQ puts him in the bottom 2 per cent of the population, a defense psychological expert testified during a weeks-long hearing this fall. His lawyer has said Hernandez's medical records mention schizophrenia dating back years, he has taken anti-psychotic medication for years, and since his arrest, he has been diagnosed with schizotypal personality disorder. Its effects on him include 'cognitive and perceptual distortions,' including hallucinations, Fishbein has said. In one of the confessions, Hernandez says he has had visions of his dead mother. A defense psychologist told the court he believed Hernandez would not have fully comprehended what he was agreeing to in saying he understood his Miranda rights. But a prosecution expert differed, noting that Hernandez scored not much below people of average intelligence on a specific test of how well someone understands the function of the familiar Miranda rights warning during police interrogation. 'The evidence convincingly demonstrated that he knowingly waived those rights and voluntarily provided a statement,' Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Joan Illuzzi-Orbon later wrote in a court filing. Hernandez had gone through 11th grade without special education or remedial summer school, represented himself in a prolonged divorce and child support proceeding, participated in his church, and successfully applied for Social Security disability benefits, the prosecutor noted. Etan's parents have not commented.","Etan Patz disappeared while walking to his school bus stop in New York .

"Monica Lewinsky has revealed that she uses a pseudonym sometimes to protect her privacy, but refuses to change her name even though the Clinton sex scandal has made her 'unemployable.' The former White House intern told Porter magazine that her name remains infamous 16 years after it was revealed she had an affair with President Bill Clinton. However, she says, 'No one else in the investigation had to change their name. Why should I?' According to the New York Post, she told Porter magazine she sometimes uses a fake name to protect herself. Infamous: Monica Lewinsky, the former White House intern who had an affair with President Bill Clinton, says she couldn't get a job because her name became infamous . 'I use aliases at times to protect my privacy, but I’m not ashamed of who I am,' she said. Lewinsky, now 41, says she still faces challenges living with her name, which became known worldwide when she was just 22. 'For a long time I didn’t realize the implication of simple things, like looking for an apartment. Now when I fill out a form I have to think, ""Will somebody go to the press with my private information?""' Lewinsky says she was afraid she would be indicted, arrested and sent to prison at the height of the 1998 scandal. Instead, her name was plastered all over the news media and the intimate details of her dalliances with the president were widely available on the Internet. Older and wiser: Lewinsky, now 41, has stepped back into the public eye to take a stand against cyberbullying . She says that despite her credentials - including a master's degree from the London School of Economics - she could not get a job for more than decade after the affair went public. Lewinsky stayed under the radar for 15 years following the scandal that led to Clinton's impeachment and made her name synonymous with the White House sex scandal. She has recently stepped back into the public light to take a stand against cyberbullying.

"You may have noticed that the voices of politicians seem to change as they rise up the ranks. Now scientists claim that being in a position of power can fundamentally change the way you speak and other people can pick up on these vocal cues. They say that the cues - such as talking more loudly with less variation in pitch - tell people who is really in charge, regardless of what an individual is saying. Scroll down for video . Scientists claim that being in a position of power makes voices more loud and monotonous. Here, Margaret Thatcher, who famously underwent voice coaching, is pictured . ‘Our findings suggest that whether it's parents attempting to assert authority over unruly children, haggling between a car salesman and customer, or negotiations between heads of states, the sound of the voices involved may profoundly determine the outcome of those interactions,’ psychological scientist Sei Jin Ko of San Diego State University said. Dr Ko and her team had long been interested in non-language-related properties of speech, but it was former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher that inspired them to investigate the relationship between acoustic cues and power. ‘It was quite well known that Thatcher had gone through extensive voice coaching to exude a more authoritative, powerful persona,’ she explained. ‘We wanted to explore how something so fundamental as power might elicit changes in the way a voice sounds, and how these situational vocal changes impact the way listeners perceive and behave toward the speakers.’ To find out, Dr Ko, Melody Sadler, also of San Diego State and Adam Galinsky of Columbia Business School, designed two studies. In the experiment, 'high status' individuals tended to make their voices go up in pitch slightly. Powerful people had more monotonous voices without as much variety in pitch as more lowly workers. Their voices also varied more in volume than the voices of students assigned low-power roles. Generally speaking, powerful people speak louder than others. The study found that listeners naturally pick up these cues to work out people in positions of authority. In the first experiment, they recorded 161 college students reading a passage so they could record their natural acoustics. The participants were then randomly assigned to play a specific role in a negotiation exercise, according to the study, published in the journal Psychological Science. Students assigned to a ‘high rank’ were told to go into the negotiation imagining that they either had a strong alternative offer, valuable inside information, or high status in the workplace. Alternatively, they were also asked to recall an experience in which they had power before the negotiation started. Low-rank students, on the other hand, were told to imagine they had either a weak offer, no inside information, or low workplace status, or they were asked to recall an experience in which they lacked power. The students then read a second passage aloud in character, as if they were negotiating with an imaginary adversary and their voices were recorded. All the students involved in the experiment read the same opening, which allowed the researchers to examine acoustics fairly, because the contents of the passage remained the same. Powerful individuals (exemplified by Hilary Clinton) tended to go up in pitch in the experiment, as well as become more monotonous in tone. They also varied more in volume than the voices of people acting as less powerful people in the experiment . Comparing the first and second recordings, the researchers found that the voices of students assigned to high-power roles tended to go up in pitch, as well as become more monotone - with less variable in pitch – and varied more in volume than the voices of students assigned low-power roles. ‘Amazingly, power affected our participants' voices in almost the exact same way that Thatcher's voice changed after her vocal training,’ said Professor Galinsky. While Baroness Thatcher's voice got deeper overall thanks to voice coaching, the researchers told MailOnline that it got higher pitched in 'power situations'. 'That is different from a voice being generally high or low pitched,' they explained. 'Or to put it another way, even if speaker A's voice is generally lower pitched than speaker B's voice, both speakers can increase their pitch to the same degree in a high power situation.' And the students' vocal cues didn't go unnoticed. A second experiment with a separate group of college students revealed that listeners, who had no knowledge of the first experiment, were able to pick up on these power-related vocal cues to determine who did and did not have power. Listeners ranked speakers who had been assigned to the high-rank group as more likely to engage in high-power behaviours and they were able to spot whether a speaker held a position of power or not, with ‘considerable accuracy’. Echoing the findings of the first experiment, listeners tended to associate higher pitch and voices that varied in volume, with powerful people. They also associated louder voices with higher power. ‘These findings suggest that listeners are quite perceptive to these subtle variations in vocal cues and they use these cues to decide who is in charge,’ Professor Galinsky said.","Scientists from San Diego State University in California claim that being in a position of power can fundamentally change the way you speak .
They say people easily pick up on these vocal clues too .
Experiment found that powerful people have more monotonous, higher pitched voices than people with less powerful roles .

Little Dina Frank could not walk through the metal detectors because of her crutches and orthotics, and was instead subjected to a pat down by security agents – a severely traumatic event for the young girl. Dr Joseph Frank, a doctor who practices pediatrics on Long Island, exclusively told the Daily that the lengthy pat down and resulting emotional trauma caused the family to miss their flight to Florida. Scroll down for video . Checkpoint: Dina Frank, seven, was forced to undergo a pat-down at JFK Airport . Write caption here . Rep. Francisco Canseco says he was inappropriately touched during a TSA pat-down . Rep. Francisco Canseco, R-Texas, claims he was assaulted during a routine pat-down at the San Antonio International Airport in Texas. The congressman called the TSA agent ‘aggressive,’ adding: ‘He was patting me down where no one is supposed to go,’ according to KENS5. When the congressman moved the TSA worker’s hand away, the agent stopped the search and brought in supervisors, he said. The TSA told KENS5 that neither man was cited in the incident. ‘She’s not a threat to national security,’ the outraged father told the iPad news publication. Because . of a reported mental illness, the family requested that the TSA agents . introduce themselves to her and take their time with the pat-down. Dr . Frank said the TSA agent on duty at JFK Monday was unnecessarily . aggressive with Dina, and so he began filming the inspection on his . iPhone. He said one of the TSA employees began screaming at him to turn the camera off, and threatened him. Later, a supervisor eventually decided that a simple inspection of Dina’s crutches was sufficient, and let the family pass. The Daily reported that the family had to wait for more than an hour for a manager told them that the TSA’s inspection of Dina was acceptable and they could proceed to the gate. The family hurried down to their gate with Dina in a wheelchair, hoping to make their flight. However, the commotion at the security checkpoint, combined with the excruciating wait, had eaten up too much time, though, and the Frank family missed their flight. The government agency launched a program in December of last year called ‘TSA Cares’ that is supposed to assist those with mental and physical disabilities. Their website reads: ‘TSA strives to provide the highest level of security while ensuring that all passengers are treated with dignity and respect.’ The helpline number offers support to those who are travelling with people who have certain medical issues, physical limitations, or mental handicaps. The TSA did not respond to calls or emails from MailOnline requesting comment. There is some good news in all of this – Dina was able to take her first unassisted steps following a revolutionary procedure where Botox and phenol are injected into her muscles. As CBS New York reported, Dina gets injections twice a year at New York Presbyterian. Phenol is an alcohol often used for chemical peels while Botox is famously used to fight wrinkles. Happy ending: By getting Botox injections in her muscles twice a year, Dina is able to walk without crutches or a wheelchair .

"Margaret Thatcher made repeated attempts to win a knighthood for Jimmy Savile  despite warnings about his ‘manner of life’. The former prime minister made at least five requests for the now-disgraced DJ to be considered for the top honour, but senior civil servants voiced fears about his ‘strange and complex’ private life. Previously unseen documents from the Cabinet Office reveal the extent of unease about the BBC presenter, almost three decades before he was finally unmasked as a predatory paedophile. Persistent: Margaret Thatcher with Jimmy Saville outside No 10 Downing Street in 1988, as it was revealed she tried five times to get him knighted while prime minister . Misgivings...and the PM's retort. Civil servants were 'worried' while Mrs Thatcher felt press reports on Savile were no forgotten . There is no suggestion that Baroness Thatcher or her aides were aware of his vile abuse of children as young as eight. Shamed DJ: Cigar-smoking Jimmy Savile pictured after receiving his knighthood at the Palace in 1990 . But the official documents show that . while BBC bosses were apparently willing to ignore the presenter’s . private life, Whitehall mandarins privately voiced their misgivings . about handing him a knighthood. The files, made public under the . Freedom of Information Act, show Mrs Thatcher wanted to bestow the . honour to reward Savile’s charity work. But her aides feared a scandal would . engulf him and expressed fears he would ‘exploit’ a knighthood and taint . the entire honours system. Mrs Thatcher eventually succeeded in . her quest and the DJ and Jim’ll Fix It presenter was made Sir Jimmy . Savile in 1990, a month after she left Downing Street. The Cabinet Office correspondence . showed her requests on his behalf began at least seven years earlier in . 1983 – the year Savile boasted to journalists that he bedded women he . met while running charity marathons. Her request was vetoed by the honours . committee, whose chairman Robert  Armstrong said it was too soon after . Savile’s ‘unfortunate revelations’. Mrs Thatcher repeated her request in . October that year but Mr Armstrong, who was also her Cabinet Secretary, . voiced ‘continued misgivings’. The civil servant said: ‘We remain . worried ... Fears have been expressed that Mr Savile might not be able . to refrain from exploiting a knighthood in a way which brought the . honours system into disrepute.’ Warnings: Lady Thatcher's aides were critical of Jimmy Savile's private life, but the Tory leader insisted his charity work meant he should become 'Sir' Later requests were also refused, to Mrs Thatcher’s evident exasperation. A letter from her private secretary . Nigel Wicks in 1986 said: ‘She is most disappointed that Mr Savile’s . name has not been recommended ... She wonders how many more times his . name is to be pushed aside.’ The Government was spearheading a . high-profile campaign to highlight the spread of Aids and Mr Armstrong . said ‘sexual promiscuity’ like Savile’s should not be encouraged. He wrote: ‘The case of Jimmy Savile is difficult. Mr Savile is a strange and complex man. ‘He deserves high praise for the lead he offers in giving quiet background help to the sick. ‘But he has made no attempt to deny the accounts in the press about his private life two or three years ago.’ Savile raised more than £30million . for good causes, including £12million to rebuild the National Spinal . Injuries Centre at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire, and he . was given an OBE in 1971. Correspondence: A handwritten letter from Jimmy Savile in which he declared his 'love' for Margaret Thatcher after being invited to lunch with her was released by the National Archives under the 30-year rule . But misgivings about his private life . meant civil servants continued to veto Mrs Thatcher’s requests for him . to be given a higher award. Mr Armstrong’s successor Robin Butler said the honours committee had rejected him for a knighthood again in 1987. A constitutional bar preventing the dead . from having their knighthoods removed means the government cannot strip Savile of the accolade . Those given a knighthood are awarded . lifetime membership to a ‘living order’ and the title no longer exists . when the holder dies. The TV host, who died aged 84, was . knighted in the Queen’s Birthday Honours list in 1990 - an award which . followed the OBE he was given . in 1971. Whitehall sources admitted they considered awarding him a posthumous knighthood – so he could then be stripped of it. The Queen has the power to remove honours after they have been recommended by the forfeiture committee. Last year Fred Goodwin, former chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland, was stripped of his knighthood. He wrote: ‘My Committee and I still . fear that his manner of life – on his own confession – has been such . that a high award for him would be an unhelpful signal when we are still . having to grapple with an Aids problem which threatens to intensify. A . knighthood for him would not benefit the honours system in the eyes of . the public.’ Previous government correspondence . has revealed that Savile wrote to Mrs Thatcher in 1980 and she invited . him to lunch at Chequers. She subsequently spent 11 consecutive New Year’s Eves with him and oversaw his eventual knighthood in 1990. It was only after his death in 2011, aged 84, that he was finally unmasked as a predatory paedophile with more than 450 victims. His decades of child abuse prompted . calls for the Honours Forfeiture Committee to revoke his knighthood, but . officials claimed it was impossible as the honour formally ended when . he died. The Cabinet Office originally refused the Freedom of . Information request to release the secret files, made by The Sun . newspaper last October. But the Information Commissioner’s . Office upheld an appeal, ruling there was ‘compelling public interest’ to release the files from the 1980s. A Cabinet Office spokesman said: . ‘There is no indication in the papers that anything was known then about . the allegations that have subsequently come to light about Jimmy . Savile. The honours process was followed in accordance with the system . at the time.’","Tory PM first asked he be made 'Sir' Jimmy in 1984, secret documents show .

"Empty chairs were laid out in Sarajevo today in honour of the 11,541 people killed in the city during the Bosnian war which began exactly 20 years ago. The seats - lined up along the city's main street - were left empty in memory of the victims of the 44-month Serb siege of the city. Hundreds of the chairs are small representing the children slain in the conflict. Bosnia remembers: 11,541 red chairs are pictured along Titova street in Sarajevo as the city marks the 20th anniversary of the start of the Bosnian war, April 6, 2012 . A city in grief: The chairs are arranged in 825 rows and look like a red river running through the city. Special small chairs have been laid out for the children who died in the conflict . Exhibitions, concerts and performances are being held across the city today two decades after the conflict began on April 6, 1992. 'This city needs to stop for a moment and pay tribute to its killed citizens,' said Haris Pasovic, organizer of the 'Sarajevo Red Line.' The Serb siege of Sarajevo went on for - 11,825 days - longer than the World War II siege of Leningrad, now St. Petersburg. Its 380,000 people were left without electricity, water or heat, hiding from the 330 shells a day that smashed into the city. Exactly 20 years ago today some 40,000 people from all over the country - Muslim Bosniaks, Christian Orthodox Serbs and Catholic Croats - poured into the square to demand peace from their quarreling nationalist politicians.

Destruction: The frontline in Bosnia was here on the mountain Trebevic. Bosnian Serb forces fired shells from this position (file photo) The European Community had recognised the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia as an independent state after most of its people voted for independence. But the people voted along ethnic lines, with Bosniaks and Croats voting for independence, and Bosnian Serbs preferring to stay with Serb-dominated Yugoslavia. The ethnic unity being displayed on the Sarajevo square irritated Serb nationalists, who then shot into the crowd from a nearby hotel, killing five people and igniting the 1992-1995 war. The Serb nationalists, helped by neighboring Serbia, laid siege to Sarajevo and within a few months occupied 70 percent of Bosnia, expelling all non-Serbs from territory they controlled. Meanwhile Bosniaks and Croats - who started off as allies - turned against each other, so all three groups ended up fighting a war that took over 100,000 lives, made half of the population homeless and left the once-ethnically mixed country devastated and divided into mono-ethnic enclaves.

Civil war: A man walks on the so-called 'sniper alley' in Sarajevo after buying a can of oil donated by the European Community . A 1995 peace agreement brokered by the United States ended the shooting but its compromises left the nation ethnically divided into two ministates - one for Serbs, the other shared by Bosniaks and Croats - linked by a central government. The result is a bureaucratic monstrosity: Bosnia has three rotating presidents at the state level and each ministate has its own president - that's five presidents in all. There are 13 prime ministers in total, over 130 ministers, more than 760 lawmakers and 148 municipalities. Not only does this cost the impoverished nation of 3.5 million over 50 percent of its annual GDP but it leads to endless bickering between institutions. Brussels insists Bosnia must be more centralised but that goes against Serbs' desire to maintain their autonomy. Bogdan Vukadin was one of those Serb soldiers firing from the mountains on Sarajevo during the war. 'We did not fight this war for nothing,' he says. 'We have our Serb Republic, we have our government, we have our president, we have our own institutions.' Ethnic mistrust or economic differences between the mini-states are keeping the groups in Bosnia separated.

Children in school are learning three different version of history, calling their common language by three different names - Serbian, Bosnian and Croatian - and are growing isolated from each other in monoethnic enclaves. Foreign investors - the only hope for the country's economy - are avoiding Bosnia for its political instability and its enormous bureaucracy. The pressure to join the EU has united some of the country's institutions. Bosnia now has a common currency, a central bank, its two ministate police forces are run by a joint ministry. There is a state court, border police on state level and even a joint army - melded from the three that once fought each other. Now those same soldiers from all three armies are united, protesting together over a lack of retirement pay and jobs in the same central Sarajevo square. Dressed in old uniforms, exhausted and unshaved, Serbs, Bosniaks and Croats sleep and eat at this doomed square, occasionally shouting up to nearby government offices 'Thieves, thieves!' The former soldiers say they are here to defend Bosnia from lying politicians. Many of them were only 17 in 1992 when the ethnically mixed crowd gathered to demand peace but was cheated. 'We will be here together till the end, demanding our rights,' said Milomir Saric, a Bosnian Serb veteran.

"Deep beneath the ocean, crawling on rock chimneys spewing out hot water, lies the nearest thing on Earth to an alien, Nasa has claimed. It says the 'extreme shrimps' that have evolved could give us a glimpse of what alien life on other planets looks like. They even believe similar animals may exist on other planetary bodies, such as Jupiter's icy moon Europa, which has a subsurface ocean. Rimicaris hybisae crawling on rock chimneys spewing out hot water: Researchers say life on Europa could look similar . The particular bacteria in the vents are able to survive in extreme environments because of chemosynthesis, a process that works in the absence of sunlight and involves organisms getting energy from chemical reactions. In this case, the bacteria use hydrogen sulfide, a chemical abundant at the vents, to make organic matter. The temperatures at the vents can climb up to a scorching 750 degrees Fahrenheit (400 degrees Celsius), but waters just an inch away are cool enough to support the shrimp. The shrimp are blind, but have thermal receptors in the backs of their heads. 'For two-thirds of the Earth's history, life has existed only as microbial life,' said Max Coleman, senior research scientist at t Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.. 'On Europa, the best chance for life would be microbial.' Nasa is now studying the shrimp in the Caribbean, at one of the world's deepest undersea hydrothermal vents. There, tiny shrimp are piled on top of each other, layer upon layer, crawling on rock chimneys that spew hot water. Bacteria inside the shrimps' mouths and in specially evolved gill covers, produce organic matter that feed the crustaceans. Scientists a are studying this mysterious ecosystem in the Caribbean to get clues about what life could be like on other planetary bodies, such as Jupiter's icy moon Europa, which has a subsurface ocean.

'The overall objective of our research is to see how much life or biomass can be supported by the chemical energy of the hot submarine springs,' Coleman said. Scientists collected extensive specimens from two hydrothermal vent fields: The Von Damm field at 7,500 feet (2,300 meters) and Piccard at more than 16,000 feet (4,900 meters), which is the world's deepest. Scientists collected extensive specimens from two hydrothermal vent fields: The Von Damm field at 7,500 feet (2,300 meters) and Piccard at more than 16,000 feet (4,900 meters), which is the world's deepest. Hydrogen sulfide is toxic to organisms in high concentrations, but the bacteria feeding the shrimp need a certain amount of this chemical to survive. Nature has worked out a solution: The shrimp position themselves on the very border between normal, oxygenated ocean water and sulfide-rich water so that they and the bacteria can coexist in harmony. 'It's a remarkable symbiotic system,' Coleman said. Coleman was part of a team led by Chris German at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, that discovered these vents in 2009, off the west coast of Cuba. This research, funded under NASA's Astrobiology Science and Technology for Exploring Planets program, detected the vents by picking up the chemical signals of their plumes of water in the ocean. The researchers returned in 2012 on the RV Atlantis with a robotic vehicle called Jason, supported by the National Science Foundation. Coleman and collaborator Cindy Van Dover, marine biologist at Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, examined the shrimp for the first time when the same team returned in 2013 on the RV Falkor, provided by the Schmidt Ocean Institute in Palo Alto, California. Van Dover returned soon after using the robotic vehicle Hercules aboard the Exploration Vessel Nautilus, and did more collections and studies. A bonus finding from studying this extreme oasis of life is that some of the shrimp, called Rimicaris hybisae, appear to be cannibalistic . A bonus finding from studying this extreme oasis of life is that some of the shrimp, called Rimicaris hybisae, appear to be cannibalistic. The researchers discovered that when the shrimp arrange themselves in dense groups, bacteria seem to be the main food supplier, as the shrimp likely absorb the carbohydrates that the bacteria produce. But in areas where the shrimp are distributed more sparsely, the shrimp are more likely to turn carnivorous, eating snails, other crustaceans, and even each other. Although the researchers did not directly observe Rimicaris hybisae practicing cannibalism, scientists did find bits of crustaceans in the shrimps' guts. And Rimicaris hybisae is the most abundant crustacean species in the area by far. 'Whether an animal like this could exist on Europa heavily depends on the actual amount of energy that's released there, through hydrothermal vents,' said Emma Versteegh, a postdoctoral fellow at JPL.","Rimicaris hybisae crawling on rock chimneys spewing out hot water .

"The detective who led the investigation into Britain's most notorious child abusers has claimed there could be another 17 unsolved murders at the hands of the brutal gang. Former Scotland Yard detective Roger Stoodley also believes investigation files relating to the group - which abducted, abused and murdered children during the 1980s - could contain vital evidence about a VIP paedophile ring which allegedly abused boys at a London guest house. Under Operation Orchid, Mr Stoodley helped expose the murders of three children by a gang of paedophiles, of which fairground worker Sidney Cooke was one of the ringleaders. The victims were Jason Swift, 14, six-year-old Barry Lewis and Mark Tildesley, seven. A former detective says there could be 17 unsolved murders linked to a group of child killers including Sidney Cooke (left) and that the investigation could hold evidence about a paedophile ring which allegedly abused boys at Elm Guest House (right) But detectives believed at the time that as many as 17 other abductions and murders were connected to the notorious gang. Mr Stoodley said detectives worked on the premise that there were 20 victims involved in Cooke's gang, but that only three were established. 'It seems unbelievable but we were told there may have been twenty paedophile murders,' he said. 'We proved there were three and there may have been more. There are potentially 17 unsolved murders.' Detectives at the time also investigated links between Cooke's group and the Elm Guest House in Barnes - where it is alleged politicians and other VIPs attacked and abused children - but could not find a link. Scotland Yard last week launched a new probe into the possibility of murders linked to the guest house, which is at the centre of the inquiry into the establishment paedophile conspiracy. Mr Stoodley told the Times: 'The Orchid files - if they still exist - could hold the key to renewed concerns over the handling of police investigations into two child abductions. 'Elm Guest House came up in our inquiry but it was not within our remit at the time. It is in our system but we could not establish a link with Cooke.' Vishal Mehrotra's father Vishambar (right) has claimed his son (left) was abducted, abused and murdered by a Westminster VIP paedophile ring which he says was linked to the guest house . Mr Stoodley believes the connection may have been through Leonard Smith, one of Cooke’s accomplices, who may have been a male prostitute at Elm Guest House. He said: 'We had reason to believe he could have gone there in the past, but Smith would never cooperate with us. He refused to speak. He would always just say ""no comment"". And he is dead now.' He added: 'The lot we put away were dirty, disgusting individuals. I don’t think their paths would ever have crossed with those visiting Elm Guest House because they moved in different circles.' Yesterday, the families of eight-year-old Vishal Mehrotra, who was abducted and murdered in 1981, and Martin Allen, 15, who disappeared in 1979, called on the Metropolitan Police to see whether the two rings are connected. Mehrotra, 69, a retired magistrate, said a male prostitute told him that Vishal was taken to the Elm Guest House where high-profile abusers attacked children. Mr Mehota recorded the conversation but when he presented police with the evidence, Scotland Yard ‘pooh poohed’ it and failed to investigate, he alleged. The skull and several rib bones of Vishal were discovered in 1982 by pigeon shooters in remote marshland at Durford Abbey Farm, at Rogate, close to the Hampshire-West Sussex border. Vishal, from Putney, south-west London, had vanished while shopping with his nanny and sister on July 29, 1981 - the same day Lady Diana Spencer and the Prince of Wales were married. In June 1982, four months after Vishal's remains were found, police raided the Elm Guest House and it was widely reported at the time that the raids were linked to the boy's disappearance. Mr Stoodley said the disappearances of Vishal and Martin 'matched the modus operandi' of Cooke and his associates. Cooke's gang worked by luring boys away while they were walking on their own. They also  groomed them for abuse. Operation Orchid, which was wound up shortly after Mr Stoodley retired in 1992, resulted in Cooke serving two life sentences for sexual abuse. Meanwhile, detective Jackie Malton, who worked on the original case, told the Daily Telegraph she had a feeling of 'misuse of power' during her time at Scotland Yard. Miss Malton, a former detective chief inspector and the inspiration for the Prime Suspect TV drama series, said: 'There is clear evidence that something was happening at that guest house. It has been alleged several high-profile individuals also abused boys at the prestigious Dolphin Square (pictured) development in Pimlico . 'If nothing has been done about it in retrospect, then Mr Mehrotra is right. Either the police disbelieved it, or they covered it up one way or another. 'I do remember that the officers were highly passionate about the Mehrotra case, but for some reason we never managed to get anywhere.' She added: 'There was also a strong sense of the power of Parliament and of politicians. It was very much a case of 'Do as you are told.' The new probe into the guest house was triggered after another victim came forward alleging to have witnessed the murder of three boys, including one who was allegedly strangled by a Conservative MP during a sex game. The Metropolitan Police announced last week that it is investigating the possibility of murders linked to the Elm Guest House. Allegations of a VIP paedophile ring 30 years ago are being investigated by Scotland Yard through Operation Fairbank, launched two years. Operation Fairbank started in response to information passed on by MP Tom Watson, who used Prime Minister's Questions in 2012 to air claims that there was a paedophile ring with links to No 10. The late Liberal MP Cyril Smith is one public figure widely alleged to have abused children from Grafton Close at the Elm Guest House. As well as Elm Guest House, some of the abuse allegedly took place at flats in Dolphin Square, Pimlico, where some politicians had London homes. A spokesman for the force said it would not give a 'running commentary' on the inquiries. Sidney Cooke (pictured right), a former fairground worker, earned his reputation as one of the country's most notorious paedophiles when he was a leading member of a gang that operated from a flat in Hackney, east London. The gang, known as the Dirty Dozen, hired out rent boys or snatched children off the streets before subjecting them to abuse and sexual torture. Cooke - known as 'Hissing Sid' - was released from jail in April 1999, after serving nine years for the murder of 14-year-old rent boy Jason Swift in 1985. But, after his release, he was immediately taken into voluntary custody for his own safety. Detectives, convinced he was responsible for other similar unsolved crimes, kept his file open. Within months Cooke, now aged 87, was accused of abusing two teenage brothers he befriended while working on fairgrounds more than 30 years ago. In an unexpected move at Manchester Crown Court, Cooke suddenly changed his plea to guilty and admitted ten offences against the youngsters and subsequently received two life sentences. Four charges of rape, a further three of indecent assault and one of buggery were left on the court file. Cooke was convicted for Jason Swift's murder alonside Leslie Bailey, Robert Oliver and Steven Barrell. Bailey was convicted in 1992 of the manslaughter of seven-year-old Mark Tildesley who was raped in Cooke's caravan while visiting a fairground near Wokingham, Berkshire, in 1984. Bailey was also convicted of the murder of Barry Lewis, six, who was abducted in June 1991 before being sexually abused by up to eight men. Cooke is still in jail. Bailey was murdered in his prison cell in 1993 and Oliver was reported  to be living in a bail hostel in Guildford, Surrey. The whereabouts of Barrell are unknown.","Roger Stoodley helped expose 1980s child abuse ring led by Sidney Cooke .

'He marched the halls of NBC like he was Oz,' added the source. The Cosby Show aired from 1984 to 1992. Another source that worked on his later show Cosby, which aired from 1996 to 2000, explained that Bill could intimidate people. 'He was very courteous, but he expected things to be done in a certain way,' said the source. 'He didn't suffer fools. A lot of people were afraid of him on-set.' Another cover: In the new issue of UsWeekly, the 77-year-old star is attacked by former model Janice Dickinson who said she is speaking now because women need to be warned . Janice Dickinson, who claimed Bill assaulted her in 1982, told UsWeekly, 'Bill Cosby is a monster.' As far as talking about the past, the brunette E! fixture said, 'It's justice - it has to be done.' The former supermodel, 59, explained why she was speaking out now. 'I'm doing it for all women who've had their innocence robbed. And I want women who know Cosby to be worried. It happened to me; it could still happen to them.' The National Enquirer claimed that this collection of explosive claims could lead to a divorce from his wife of 50 years, Camille. And then there is this: The National Enquirer suggested the allegations may lead to a split with his wife of 50 years Camille and there could be $350m at stake . The weekly estimated the divorce could put a dent in his $350m fortune if it were to happen. 'She survived the tragic murder of their beloved son [Ennis, 27, in 1997], and she bravely stood by Bill during the disclosure of an extramarital affair and a ""love child"" but there's only so much more she can take,' said the source. 'I know Camille is feeling humiliated by all this - and even worse, she's come under personal attack.' Mrs Cosby: The actor, who is reportedly worth $350m, pictured with his wife of 50 years, Camille, at a red carpet event . An insider also told The Enquirer, 'Whether Camille will continue to stand by her man is in question.' One of his accusers, Carla Ferrigno, brought Camille into the mix. 'She's known all these years,' Carla alleged in a radio interview. 'This is disgusting that she would stay with this man.' Family man: The TV fixture with his wife Camille and two children in 1966 in Orlando, Florida . Jewel Allison is the latest woman to accuse the former Jell-O spokesman - who has never been charged with a crime - of rape. She has claimed that the comedian spiked her glass of wine during a dinner at his Philadelphia home in the late eighties before forcing her to touch his genitals. Jewel has said he may be the 'greatest serial rapist that ever got away with it.' One accuser said this weekend that she was planning to mount a class action lawsuit against Cosby with as many as nine other women. Still working: Bill at The King Center in Florida on November 21; he calls the numerous claims 'innuendo' Actress Louisa Moritz, who claimed Cosby assaulted her before an appearance on the Tonight Show, told TMZ that she had reached out to other alleged victims to join her legal case. The 68-year-old star of One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest said she was sitting in the green room before her spot on the show in 1971 when Cosby entered the room. She claimed he implied 'that he was going to see to it that I will become a major star' before forcing her to perform oral sex. Ms Moritz alleged that as Cosby left, after the abuse, he said: 'Now you don't want to upset me and the plans for your future, do you?' He ruled the airwaves during the 1980s: The comedian (far left) with his TV family on The Cosby Show which aired from 1984 to 1992 . Cosby's lawyer Martin Singer has said branded the stories 'completely illogical' and added that the claims are 'increasingly ridiculous' and 'passed the point of absurdity'. In a statement released on Friday, he said: 'The new, never-before-heard claims from women who have come forward in the past two weeks with unsubstantiated, fantastical stories about things they say occurred 30, 40, or even 50 years ago have escalated far past the point of absurdity. 'These brand new claims about alleged decades-old events are becoming increasingly ridiculous, and it is completely illogical that so many people would have said nothing, done nothing, and made no reports to law enforcement or asserted civil claims if they thought they had been assaulted over a span of so many years.' One of his accusers: Actress Louisa Moritz said Cosby forced oral sex on her . Not afraid to speak up: Janice Dickinson, pictured in 2011, called the icon a 'monster' and said she was talking now to help other women . Andrea Constand - A Temple University employee, she claimed in 2006 that Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in his Philadelphia-area mansion two years earlier. Cosby eventually settled this suit out of court as the prosecution said they had 13 Jane Does who would testify Cosby did the same to them in the past. Barbara Bowman - Bowman told MailOnline that Cosby raped and drugged her back in 1985 when she was a 17-year-old aspiring actress. Bowman was one of the 13 Jane Does in the 2006 trial against Cosby. Joan Tarshis - Tarshis claimed that she was just 19-years-old when Cosby drugged and raped her twice in Hollywood back in 1969 while she was working as a writer for him. Janice Dickinson - The supermodel said in an interview that Cosby asked her to come to Lake Tahoe and talk about a television role in 1982, but ended up drugging and raping her. Tamara Green - Green, who first came forward in 2005 told MailOnline that she was an aspiring actress in the 1970s when Cosby gave her pills and pretended to care for her while she had the flu, but instead sexually assaulted her. Therese Serignese - Also one of the 13 Jane Does, she says she was 19 when Cosby drugged and raped her in Las Vegas after one of his shows. Louisa Moritz - She accused Cosby of sexual assault, saying he once forced her into oral sex, backstage at The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson in 1971, and implied he would further her career if she went through with it. Linda Joy Traitz - She said earlier this week that she was just 19 when Cosby drove her out to a beach and tried to get her to take pills to relax, before becoming 'sexually aggressive'. Traitz, of Hallandale Beach, Florida, has been charged in the past with trafficking pills. Cosby's attorney, Marty Singer, is trying to use Traitz's past to discredit her claims against his client. Beth Ferrier - Beth Ferrier claims she had relationship with Cosby in the mid-1980s. She claims that she awoke in her car with her clothes in disarray and not remembering what had happened. Ferrier has claimed that he drugged her coffee. Carla Ferrigno - The wife of Incredible Hulk star Lou Ferrigno, claims Cosby tried to sexually assault her during a gathering at his house in 1967. What's more, Cosby allegedly tried to use a friend to help court Ferrigno, and allegedly made his move on the former Playboy Bunny just moments after his own wife, Camille, left the room. Angela Leslie - The former model-actress claims that Cosby forced her to masturbate him in his Vegas hotel suite after giving her a strong drink in 1992. Renita Chainey Hill - The 47-year-old mother-of-three who met Cosby when she was offered a role on Picture Pages in Pittsburgh claimed he would fly her to different cities around the United States and drug her during a four-year relationship.

Ruehli alleges that he drugged two bourbons he poured her and she came to when he was on top of her, shirtless. Victoria Valentino - The former Playboy playmate claims Cosby drugged her and a friend, tried to rape her friend then violated her instead in a Hollywood apartment after dinner.

"A promising teenage artist has died after police Tased him for allegedly spraying graffiti on a wall. Israel Hernandez-Llach, 18, had sprayed an 'R' - the first letter of his artist name, Reefa - on an abandoned McDonalds when police saw him and gave chase in Miami, Florida at 5am on Tuesday. After officers followed him over fences and down alleys, the teen ran towards them and, fearing a physical alercation, officers Tased the youth to the ground, Police Chief Ray Martinez said. Scroll down for video . Loss: Israel Hernandez-Llach, 18, has died after he was Tased by police who caught him spraying graffiti on an abandoned building. The teenager was known for his art and photography in Miami . 'During the foot pursuit, the subject . encountered officers face to face... and ignored officers' commands to . stop,' Martinez said. 'In order to affect his . arrest, an officer deployed his conducted electrical weapon (TASER). 'The officers were forced to use the Taser to avoid a physical incident.' He was hit once in the chest and . collapsed, and when officers saw he was in distress, he was transported . by fire-rescue to Mount Sinai Hospital. He was pronounced dead at . 6.15am. His friends Felix Fernandez and Thiago Souza said they had been serving as lookouts when he was seen by police on Tuesday morning. 'Art obsessed': Hernandez, pictured helping out on a photo shoot, did nothing but think of art, his sister said . Incident: The teenager had tried to escape from police after they spotted him on Tuesday morning, but they eventually caught up with him. He died after he was Tased once in the chest . According to Amnesty International, between 2001 and 2008, 351 people in the U.S. died after being shocked by police Tasers. Another report said there were another 190 taser-related deaths in the U.S. between 2009 and 2013, bringing the total to 541. Critics of Taser guns have argued that the stun device can cause cardiac arrest or heart attacks and subsequently death, even in those who appear healthy. Pre-existing medical conditions or drug use - in association with the shock - have also been blamed for the deaths. Earlier this week, it was reported that John Wrana, a 95-year-old World War II veteran, died after he was Tased and shot with bean-bag ammo by police after he brandished his cane at officers. Police had been called to his Chicago assisted living home because he was being combative while being involuntarily committed for medical treatment, it was reported. They claimed that, after he was . captured, they saw the officers push the teenager against a wall and . high-five as he lay motionless on the ground. 'That made me feel terrible inside,' Fernandez told WSVN. 'These cops are gruesome, and they don't really care.' 'They . were making fun of how he tensed up when he got Tased,' one of the . teenagers told CBS Philadelphia. 'They were just laughing, ""You should've seen him, you . should've seen him"".' An . autopsy has been completed but the medical examiner has not yet released a cause of death. The death is also under investigation by the city and . the state attorney's office. Deaths by Taser are uncommon but not . unheard of. Autopsies often find that the victim had been taking drugs . or suffered from a pre-existing medical condition, the Miami Herald noted. Hernandez's friends told CBS Philadelphia that earlier in the day they had been smoking marijuana and a toxicology test is now being carried out on Hernandez's body. Scene: He had sprayed the letter 'R' on this wall - for his street artist name, Reefa - when he was caught . Worth it?

'The city of Miami Beach would like to extend their condolences to the family of Israel Hernandez,' Martinez said.

"Anyone planning a Thanksgiving trip has been warned to set off early to avoid a devastating nor'easter set to to pour snow and rain on the East Coast the day before Thanksgiving. Travelers whose journeys include the busy highways linking the major cities along the eastern seaboard were told to dodge the incoming storm - now brewing over the Atlantic - by traveling on Tuesday instead of Wednesday if they can. Some predictions have said that as much a six inches of snow could coat Boston, New York City and Washington, D.C., this week - causing travel chaos down the I-95 corridor. Start of the week: Rains will fall in New England to begin with, but a new system from the south will bring more rainfall . Closer: The system from the south-east Atlantic will bring rains along with it, which could later turn to snow . Dangerous: Thunderstorms on the south coast and bands of rain and snow in the Northeast will strike Wednesday, making for millions of difficult journeys home . Feast day: Thanksgiving itself is set to feature some snow along the eastern seaboard as well, though much of the country will be clear . Robert Sinclair Jr, a spokesman for the AAA in New York, said Monday: 'I would pack your patience'. He then suggested some of the 41.3million travelers expected to hit the roads this weekend could lessen the stress by moving a different day. Precipitation was forecast to sweep in from the south Tuesday night into Wednesday morning and exit the region Thursday morning. Jeff Masters, chief meteorologist for Weather Underground, said coastal cities are likely to mostly receive rain, although he cautioned Monday afternoon that meteorologists would be keeping a close eye on the rain/snow line. 'A small deviation in the track could change things dramatically,' he said. As of Monday, the highest amount of snow was expected to fall in northeastern Pennsylvania, the Catskills of upstate New York and into Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine. Ten inches was possible in some places, forecasters said. Storm's on the way: A powerful storm which could make its way across the eastern coast Wednesday, shown above with its center over North Carolina and yawning out over the East coast, has the potential to slow down planes and highways . It came as winds over the Midwest and towards the east of the country caused early delays for those heading home at the start of the week. The Federal Aviation Administration reported delays Monday morning at New York LaGuardia, Boston Logan, Chicago O'Hare and Philadelphia airports from 16 to 45 minutes. On the prospect of Thanksgiving storms, the National Weather Service said: 'Heads up to snow lovers and for those planning on traveling around Thanksgiving this week... 'Models continue to show the potential for a mid-week storm to ride up the East coast Wednesday into Thursday. Accumulating snow will be possible across the Mid-Atlantic and into the Northeast.' A later update said: 'On Wednesday, a developing low pressure center off the Southeast coast will rapidly intensify as it moves parallel to the east coast. The track of the low remains uncertain. Bundle up! Indicated in red are possible areas which may see snowfall this week. The severity of a storm system  during the middle of this week will be based on its proximity to the coast . Delays: High winds across the Midwest and east of the country have been causing flight delays . Delays: Flights at eastern airports Monday were being held by up to 45 minutes due to high winds . 'A band of snow will likely develop on the northwest side of the storm, but the location of that band is highly dependent on the track of the storm.' More than 46million Americans are expected to take major trips around Thanksgiving, the highest figure in seven years. The AAA said that traveler volumes will rise another 4.2 per cent on 2013 levels, and will see families make an average journey of 50 miles. A large majority of travelers - 89 per cent - will go by car, with 8 per cent commuting by airplane, and other methods making up the final 3 per cent. Overall, the day before Thanksgiving - and Thanksgiving itself - are among the busiest travel days of the year, close to Christmas and summer vacation periods. According to government statistics, the average Thanksgiving long-distance trip length is 214 miles (for Christmas it is 275), and even long-distances travelers tend only to spend three nights away. Thanksgiving itself is actually a busier day for travel than the day before, as the majority of those with less than 100 miles to travel do so without staying the night. Aid: Buffalo fireman from Engine 25 try to locate a fire hydrant on the corner of Paul Pl and Seneca Street . Around Buffalo, New York, residents last week buried in as much as seven feet of snow are still feeling the after-effects as temperatures climb and threaten to bring floods. The National Weather Service said roads could flood quickly from snow melt since the storm blocked drains, and issued warnings for potential flooding of four rivers and creeks. 'Snowmelt is well underway and will continue through Monday,' the weather service said on its website. 'It is this snowmelt that will ultimately cause the flooding concerns.'","Storm over the Atlantic could bring rain and snow from Boston to Miami .

'This is by the way the first album I ever bought with my own money. I was ten years old, maybe 11.' He continued: 'A musical prodigy with an electrifying voice, Stevie's blend of R&B and jazz and funk and blues and soul and whatever else you got speaks of love and loss, justice and equality, war and peace. Scientist: Physicist Mildred Dresselhaus also got a gong from Obama . Handshake: Obama congratulates professional golfer Charles Sifford on his award . 'But what really defines Stevie's music is the warmth and humanity that resonates in every note.

In a reference to one of Wonder's biggest hits, he finished by saying: 'And thanks to Stevie all of us have been moved to Higher Ground.'

"The white supremacists rounded up in central Florida over the weekend were stockpiling weapons and training for a 'coming race war,' where they planned to kill minorities, immigrants and Jews, according to authorities. Court documents reveal the ten members of American Front were preparing to become active again and recapture media attention, possibly with an assault on Orlando City Hall, in an effort to attract new recruits. They were also allegedly planning to manufacture the deadly toxin ricin, which the government considers a weapon of mass destruction. 'Racist skinheads': Marcus Faella, 39, and his wife Patricia, 36, are both leaders of the St Cloud, Florida, chapter of American Front, which is a violent skinhead organization . Take up arms: Mark McGowan, 29, also a leader of the group, and his wife Jennifer, 25, are both charged with offering illegal paramilitary training . According to court documents obtained . by the Orlando Sentinel, the St Cloud chapter of American Front, deemed a . 'racist skinhead group' by the Anti-Defamation League, made a base at . the secluded home of leaders Marcus and Patricia Faella. On the Faella's 'Aryan Compound' in . rural Osceola County, five miles from the nearest paved road, the white . supremacists trained with AK-47s and other weapons during 'mandatory' practice sessions. Marcus Faella allegedly told his followers to picture the heads of black people as they fired at targets. Last summer, a member of the US . National Guard, who was in a Missouri chapter of American Front, visited . the group in Florida for hand-to-hand combat training and instruction . on fighting with knives, the Sentinel reported. Faella believed there was an . inevitable race war coming and he saw American Front as being the . protectors of the 'white race.' And he wanted to be ready. He fortified his compound with . railroad timbers, cement pilings and barbed wire. He cut gun-ports in . the sides of his trailer so he and others stick their rifles through. He . and the other members stockpiled weapons and ammunition and military . MREs -- 'meals ready-to-eat.' Marked: Many members of American Front have tattoos signifying their allegiance to the white power movement. Kent McLellan, 22, (left) has facial tattoos. A swastika is visible on Diane Stevens, 28 (right) Newest suspects: Christopher Brooks, 27, (left) was arrested Monday. His friend, Richard 'Swamp Nazi' Stockdale (right), 24, was picked up by police a short time later . Some of his followers carried . sharpened screwdrivers as weapons -- deadly in a fight, but wouldn't get . them arrested if they were stopped by the police, according to . authorities. Faella believed he and his white-power . followers had been too quiet for too long and they were planning to . recapture headlines and leap back into public attention. One of the ways he planned to do this, . and attract new recruits in the process, was to start a 'disturbance' at Orlando City Hall. It's unclear what kind of action the group was . planning. When pro-labor union groups came out . for the May Day protests May 1, the group planned a counter-protest and . made signs that were designed to double as weapons. It is unknown . whether American Front actually attended the counter-protest. In all, ten members of the group have been arrested on charges of criminal conspiracy and committing hate crimes. 'Coming race war': Paul Jackson, 25, (left) and Dustin Perry, 21, (right) are allegedly two of the foot soldiers in the American Front organization . Marcus and Patricia Faella, age 39 and 36, were released after posting $1 million in combined bail. Mark McGowan, 29, is the treasurer . for American Front. He and his wife, Jennifer, 25, face additional . charges of offering paramilitary weapons training, knowing the new skills were likely to be used to fight the government. The others arrested over the weekend and on Monday were: Diane Stevens, 28, Kent McLellan, 22, Paul Jackson, 25, Christopher Brooks, 27, Dustin Perry, 21, and Richard 'Swamp Nazi' Stockdale, 24. The arrests over the weekend were the . second wave of busts in a major FBI investigation of white supremacist . groups in central Florida, the Southern Poverty Law Center reported. All of them belong to American Front . in St Cloud, Florida, an organization that bills its mission as . 'religious and cultural preservation of the European people,' according . to the Sentinel. But . the Anti-Defamation league calls American Front 'a racist skinhead . group' that has long been involved in violent crimes against Jews, . immigrants and other minorities. Prosecutors took it even farther, saying it is a 'domestic terror group.' All of the members were charged with committing a hate crime and criminal conspiracy. Marcus Faella has a long history in white supremacist groups in Florida. In the early 1990s, he was a member of another racist group, the Confederate Hammerskins, and was the head of the chapter in Melbourne, Florida. In March, authorities arrested six people in Orlando who were members of the Outlaws Motorcycle Club and the 1st SS Kavallerie Brigade Motorcycle Division, also a white supremacist group. Police say those six people were plotting to blow up buildings and attack their enemies. Authorities told the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups, that the March arrests and the bust this weekend are linked to the same investigation.","All ten members of American Front are charged with criminal conspiracy and committing hate crimes .

"He might be at the centre of a 'black spider' letter storm but the Prince of Wales appeared to have put the furore behind him as he met children during a visit to Stroud today. The prince was all smiles as he met stall holders during a tour of the Stroud Festival of Manufacturing and Engineering, and looked impressed when he was shown an engineering project completed by local children.

'This country is always renowned as an inventor and it seems we have an enormous pool of talent, and half the battle is harnessing that talent.' Charles has long had an interest in manufacturing and engineering and supports apprentices in both industries via the Prince's Trust. He is also a regular visitor to factories and businesses linked to both industries, including, to a Jaguar Land Rover factory in Merseyside for the launch of his Industrial Cadets training programme. Not trying this one: Charles is told about another milkshake flavour - this time, Black Forest Gateau . Jovial: Charles, who was dapper in a buff overcoat and a lilac shirt,  joked with well-wishers as he arrived . The Stroud Festival of Manufacturing and Engineering  was founded in 2012 to promote Stroud's heritage and showcase local employment and training opportunities - all of which dovetails with Charles' own interests. Founded by Stroud MP Neil Carmichael, it aims to bring down youth unemployment by bringing potential young employees . Charles is in the middle of a busy run of engagements and, with the Duchess of Cornwall, will visit the West Midlands tomorrow. He has recently returned from a lengthy trip to Mexico and Colombia, also with the Duchess, and has since tackled a lengthy series of UK based visits. Most recently, he joined Raymond Blanc for a tour of the National Heritage Garden at Belmond Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons in Great Milton, Oxfordshire. Although he looked baffled when the subject of skips were brought into the conversation, Charles, a keen gardener himself, was fascinated by the vast numbers of heritage fruit and vegetable varieties growing in the plot. In total, the garden has almost 140 rare specimens of vegetable including the Delicata squash and the Carruthers pea. The site was opened last June to showcase rare varieties of vegetables and educate people about gardening.","Charles visited the Stroud Festival of Manufacturing and Engineering .

"Tragedy struck the already reeling University of Virginia campus last week when a 20-year-old student and heir to New York City supermarket fortune committed suicide last week. Peter D'Agostino, 20, was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound on Thursday. He was the great-grandson of New York City supermarket chain founder Nicholas D'Agostino Sr. The gut-wrenching tragedy comes at a particularly bad time for the university. Just last week it saw  its Phi Kappa Psi fraternity embroiled in a sickening sexual assault and, last Tuesday, missing student Hannah Graham's death was officially ruled a homicide. Scroll down for video . Sad: Supermarket heir and sophomore at the University of Virginia Peter D'Agostino shot himself at his Charlottesville home on Thursday afternoon . Big family: D'Agostino's comes from the family who started the ubiquitous New York City supermarket chain D'Agostino's. He was one of four siblings, all of Greenwich, Connecticut. He's also survived by a large extended family . D'Agostino was not a member of Phi Kappa Psi or other campus fraternity. Vice President and Chief Student Affairs officer Pat Lampkin said in statement emailed to U.Va. newspaper the Cavalier Daily: . 'This news comes in the midst of a very difficult time for the University community...Let's look out for one another as a community as we grieve Peter's loss and begin to heal together.' D'Agostino's roommate is the person who called police Thursday. They arrived to find the Greenwich, Connecticut man dead at 2:08pm. Police on Monday continued their investigation and declined to release information regarding the firearm D'Agostino used and where he might have gotten it. D'Agostino was an accomplished rower in high school while attending St. Andrew's School in Middletown, Delaware. He was also the student body president during his time at the boarding school, and gave a speech at his 2013 commencement in which he said (via The Daily Cavalier): . 'At St. Andrew's, we work hard and we hold ourselves accountable to the people around us...Our end of the bargain in these relationships means working beyond exhaustion and creating the types of intangible achievements that will ultimately reflect lives well lived.' At U.Va., he was one of the newest members of the improv group the Whethermen. The group canceled a show scheduled for this past weekend in the wake of the tragedy. Funnyman: D'Agostino (right) was a new member of UVA's improv group the Whethermen. He was envied for his spot on impersonations .

He gave a commencement speech upon his graduation in 2013 . Watch Peter D'Agostino's 2013 high school commencement speech at 34:00 mark . Family business: Peter was born into a family of grocery store heirs. His great-grandfather Nicholas D'Agostino started the now ubiquitous New York City supermarket chain in 1932 . Dark days: News of D'Agostino's death comes at a rough time for his university, which just last week got nasty news about both missing student Hannah Graham and a repugnant fraternity sex assault scandal . D'Agostino was one of four children. He was born in Manhattan and raised in tony Greenwich, Connecticut. D'Agostino spent summers at Camp Winona in Maine every year since age 7. He spent the last four summers as a counselor. You can learn more about Camp Winona here. He's survived by his parents Mary Beth and Walter D'Agostino and a large extended family, who've arranged for a wake on Monday evening and a funeral mass Tuesday. University of Virginia President Teresa A. Sullivan addressed D'Agostino's death Saturday in a letter to the school's community in which she announced all campus sororities would be suspended effective immediately in the wake of a rape scandal. 'I want to express my grief at hearing the news of the death of second-year student Peter D'Agostino,' Sullivan wrote, 'whose passing adds overwhelming emotion to what has been a difficult semester for all of us. 'We are united in our compassion, resolve, and determination: Compassion for survivors of assault; resolve to make our community better; determination to begin to solve this problem here and now. I hope that you will join me.' The ban was imposed after Rolling Stone magazine published an article detailing one woman's account of a September 2012 gang rape she endured and describing what it called a hidden culture of sexual violence. On Tuesday, it was announced University of Virginia student Hannah Graham, whose disappearance sparked a monthlong search, died from 'homicidal violence' with the exact cause still unknown. The Albemarle County Police Department outlined the findings from the Virginia medical examiner's office in the death of 18-year-old Graham but said a final autopsy report has not been issued. Graham's remains were found Oct. 18 near Charlottesville, roughly 6 miles from where the body of 20-year-old Virginia Tech student Morgan Harrington was found after she vanished in 2009. A posting on the door of Peabody Hall related to the Phi Kappa Psi gang rape allegations at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville on Monday, as well as, ostensibly, to Peter D'Agostino . Protestors carry signs and chant slogans in front of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity house at the University of Virginia late Saturday. The protest, the most well-attended of several throughout the day, was in response to the university's reaction to an alleged sexual assault of a student revealed in a recent Rolling Stone article .

"A taxpayer-funded university in New Jersey has spent $219,000 on a custom conference table that was built in China. Now, state lawmakers are calling for an investigation of Kean University and the no-bid contract that allowed administrators to pay so much for a table. The president of Kean, which charges more than $44,000 for a four-year degree, has incredibly hit back at critics. Worth it? Keane University paid $219,000 to have this conference table custom built in China - and could spend up to $270,000 on it . State lawmakers are calling for an investigation of the no-bid contract that led to the purchase . 'It is small-minded to focus on the university buying a $200,000 table,' Dawood Farahi told the Bergen County Record. 'Why not? Why not?' Farahi earns nearly $300,00 a year as the head of Kean and took home a $200,000 bonus last year. The university has already spent $219,000 and has earmarked up to $51,000 more by the time of the 22-foot circular table is finished. The Record points out that $270,000 - the amount budgeted for the table - could buy a small house in working-class Union township, where Kean is located. 'Whether or not this is legal, it's certainly not ethical and it's a waste of taxpayer money,' New Jersey state Assemblyman Joe Cryan said in a statement. 'The time to reform higher education in New Jersey is long past. I don't need a study to know a university shouldn't be spending up to $219,000 for a conference table. I already know it's wrong. So do the students and families struggling to afford a higher education.' No apologies: Kean President . Cryan called on the state attorney general to review the waivers that Kean used to buy the table without putting out a bid. Kean told The Record that the table falls under the professional creative services category that doesn't require bids. The 22-foot circular table seats 23 people and is made of oak with cherry veneer. It features data ports, gooseneck microphones, an illuminated world map and a motorized, two-tiered glass turntable. There also is a power manager unit with an 8-channel power output independent socket to reduce and restrain surge impact, and a separate equipment cabinet to house the electronic equipment . Farahi said the table would have cost $500,000 if made in the United States. The university has just opened a satellite campus in China and was hoping to foster a better relationship by ordering the custom table, administrators say. There are 880 Chinese students at Kean's campus in Wenzhou, which is being financed by the Chinese government. Farahi said it will operate an exchange program allowing New Jersey students to travel to China at little cost. About 16,000 students attend Kean, a public school in the township of Union, which is about 15 miles west of Manhattan.","Kean College in New Jersey could spend up to $270,000 on the table by the time it's finished .

"Accused: Ismail Belghar admitted assaulting his sister-in-law because he felt it 'abhorrent' his wife had been taken to the beach . A Muslim husband assaulted his sister-in-law after becoming enraged that she had taken his wife for a trip to the beach, a court heard. Ismail Belghar attacked his wife's sister, slapping her across the face, calling her a 'slut' and holding her over a car park railing when he noticed his wife Hanife Kokden had 'slightly sunburned shoulders'. The Moroccan immigrant is alleged to have assaulted his sister-in-law in New South Wales, Australia, after becoming infuriated that his wife had 'displayed her body' on a beach. The charges were brought against Belghar after his sister-in-law, Canan Kokden, 25, 'dared' to take his wife to the beach without his permission. Sydney's Daily Telegraph reported that the court heard that because of his religious beliefs and because he thought he had absolute authority over her, Belghar felt it 'abhorrent' that his wife had been to the beach, where she 'displayed her body'. Belghar had originally been charge with attempted murder. He allegedly called his sister-in-law a slut and later slapped her across the face when he saw her in the street before dragging her to a railing around a car park and holding her out over it. The court heard that Belghar, who has been married to his wife for 11 years, became aware she had been to the beach in late 2009 because her shoulders were slightly sunburned. He telephoned his sister-in-law and said: 'You slut, how dare you take my wife to the beach.' Then, shortly before Christmas 2009, Miss Kokden came face-to-face with Belghar while she was out shopping with her brother in Sydney. Belghar slapped her across the face and dragged to to the edge of a car park and held her over the side. She was freed when her brother tackled Belghar. The drama arising from the religious beliefs of Belghar, 36, has resulted in him becoming the first Muslim in Australia to be granted a trial before a judge only. Threat: Belghar is also accused of holding his sister's wife over a high-rise railing in the car park of the Sydney Broadway Shopping Centre during a confrontation . The controversial case resulted in one Australian newspaper asking the headline question today: 'Are Aussies too biased to try this Muslim man?' Two months ago, Judge Ronald Solomon granted Belghar a trial before a judge sitting alone after agreeing that he might not receive a fair trial with a jury. In his ruling Judge Solomon said that 'in light of the fact there has been adverse publicity regarding people who hold extreme Muslim faith beliefs in the community, I am of the view that the apprehension by (Belghar) that he may not receive a fair trial is a reasonable apprehension.' The Crown appealed against the judge's ruling, claiming that if he was correct every Muslim would be entitled to a judge-only trial. The Court of Criminal Appeal agreed with the Crown and overturned the ruling, ordering Belghar to be tried by a jury. The trial was due to start this week, but Belghar avoided having the case heard by a jury when the attempted murder charge was dropped and he pleaded guilty to detaining Miss Kokden for advantage to intimidate and assault. Belghar will be sentenced at a later date. Prosecutor Mark Tedeschi, QC, said he would be seeking a jail term.","Moroccan Ismail Belghar felt it 'abhorrent' his wife had been taken to a beach .

"A smash-up involving a Fiat 500 may be a common sight for people in Italy's capital city. But the care-free Italian attitude to driving is now set to be immortalised in the 24th James Bond film. Scenes from the movie - which will be released in November 2015 - will be set in Rome and feature a daring parachute descent by Daniel Craig on to the city's famous Ponte Sisto bridge. Scroll down for video .

True to form, the film will include a series of high-adrenaline car chases with some through Rome's narrow cobbled streets, which ends with one car flying in to the river Tiber. In another pursuit, the iconic Fiat 500 ends up being crushed on the approach to the Vatican. The Rome footage will be shot in February and March and cover three high-action scenes, sources have said. Other scenes will be shot south of Rome at the Royal Palace of Caserta, known as the Versailles of Italy, as well as in Serbia and at Pinewood studios in Surrey, according to Italian news agency ANSA. This will mark the first time a Bond film has ever taken place in Italy's capital, although Siena and Venice have starred in previous movies. The opening sequence of Quantum of Solace, released in 2008, featured a tile-shattering roof-top chase across Siena. Infamous Bond villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld will make a return with Christoph Waltz expected to play him . Elsewhere, it was revealed this week that infamous Bond villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld, his most feared adversary, will make a return. Django Unchained star Christoph Waltz is tipped to play the evil genius - famous for his trademark white cat and for gruesomely disposing of his failing underlings – in the new movie. The baddie made his last appearance in an ‘official’ Bond film in 1981 when he featured in For Your Eyes Only. In a nail-biting opening scene Blofeld is hanging from an helicopter  piloted by Roger Moore’s James Bond. The scene ends with Blofeld being dropped down a huge brick industrial chimney close to the River Thames in London. Pre-production work on ‘Bond 24’ has already started in Austria, and Waltz’s co-stars will be Naomie Harris as Moneypenny, Ralph Fiennes as spymaster M and Ben Whishaw as Q.","Scenes from the 24th James Bond film will be shot in Rome early next year .

"A Ugandan nanny who was caught on video kicking and stomping on a 18-month-old when the little girl was sick while eating dinner has pleaded guilty to torture. Jolly Tumuhirwe now faces up to 15 years in prison and a fine of roughly $400 (£260), after being charged with the torture of a child in her care. The 22-year-old nanny was caught attacking  Aneela Kamanzi when the child's father Eric Kamanzi, noticed that his daughter was bruised and limping. Scroll down for video . The assault happened after the child, seen being shoved off the couch in her family home in Uganda, was sick while being fed a meal by her nanny Jolly Tumuhirwe . Tumuhirwe, 22, is seen standing on Aneela's back, applying all of her weight . Instead of confronting the nanny, Mr Kamanzi  viewed the security cameras that he had installed in the family home in Nakawa after becoming concerned about his daughter's safety. The father watched in horror as the footage showed Tumuhirwe dragging the child onto the floor before beating her with a torch, and then kicking and standing on the toddler. The attack began after the little girl vomited while the nanny was feeding her a meal. According to the BBC, Mr Kamanzi broke down when the nanny told the court that she was sorry for what she had done and begged for forgiveness. The reporter said Tumuhirwe was not represented by a lawyer in court, despite the fact that one of Uganda's leading advocates offered his services. The magistrate denied the request saying the lawyer had not formally notified the court. Armed with a torch, the woman is seen repeatedly striking Aneela who lies face down on the floor . Mr Kamanzi is reported to have beaten Tumuhirwe, who had been working for the family for three months at the time, 'to a pulp' after watching the video. The nanny later reported the assault to police and Mr Kamanzi was arrested after admitting he had attacked her. But after showing police the security tapes of the assault on Aneela, the charges against the father, who works for an NGO in Kampala, were dropped. Taking a run up, Tumuhiirwe kicks the girl directly in the ribs, sending her sliding across the floor . The distressing video of the child being beaten caused outrage when it was posted online in Uganda, and has since been shared thousands of times on social media. Police had issued a statement saying the charge of torture would be amended to attempted murder, but the directorate of public prosecutions was quoted in local media stating that the charge remained torture under the Anti-Torture Act. The prosecution asked the court for an adjournment of two days so that she could gather more facts on the case. The case will return to court on Wednesday when it is expected that the magistrate will make his final ruling and sentence Tumuhirwe. Aneela can be seen a good few feet from where she lay before her nanny kicked her in the side .

"Jose Canseco and fiancee Leila Knight's engagement went kaput over the weekend and the fall out was so dramatic, police were called to the former MLB star's Las Vegas pad to get things under control. Leila Knight, a self-described model, actress and pro poker player, told TMZ Sports on Monday that she called 911 after Canseco, 50, freaked on her for wanting to end things. '[He] threatened to kill me and my mother,' she said. 'Like 20 times.' The claims come just a month after the infamous slugger fired a bullet that blew off one of his fingers and narrowly missed then-fiancee Knight. Kaput! Jose Canseco and fiancee Leila Knight called this off over the weekend--with each blaming the other for the break up--one month after canseco blew off his own finger with a pistol . 'He's an an a**h***!' she told TMZ. The swimwear model also took to twitter to vent her frustrations toward her former love. 'So happy to be single again. Took me a long time to use my brain instead of my heart,' she tweeted. She also posted on Sunday: 'My ex just threatened to kill me and my mom over and over and over and the cops came over. Can't wait to hear all the lies on his end.' Will one of those lies be that it was his idea to break things off all along? Because that's precisely what Canseco is now claiming. The one-time MVP tells TMZ that he, in fact, was the one who called things off, not Knight. 'She's slandering me because I don't want to be with her,' Canseco told TMZ. 'I fell out of love with her because she's too controlling.' And just to show how serious he is, Canseco went on to tweet: 'Tmz I am ready for a polygraph.' All told, its been a long a convoluted last few weeks for the duo. The former MLB slugger, and admitted doper, severed his left-hand middle finger last month when his handgun accidentally misfired at home while he was cleaning the firearm. Doctors reattached the digit, but last week the 50-year-old announced on Twitter that the limb had fallen off and that he planned to sell it on eBay, along with his flashy gun. Now he says the story about the finger falling off in the middle of a poker tournament was all part of an elaborate joke he devised after seeing a fake finger for sale in a Halloween shop, TMZ reports. Canseco's lighthearted attitude about the painful injury is marked change from last month, when he broke down in tears about the incident to Inside Edition. Describing what happened, he said: 'At first I heard it go off and I actually grabbed the gun and put it on the table. '(I) thought nothing had happened. Then I look at my hand and my finger’s blown off.' Canseco explained the bullet only narrowly missed Knight who was standing nearby. She quickly ran to his aid. 'I was telling Jose not to look at his hand because he kept saying that he felt nauseous and said he was going to pass out,' Knight told Inside Edition. Healing: 'She's slandering me because I don't want to be with her,' Canseco said . 'I fell out of love with her because she's too controlling' said Canseco .

"As the three thin needles at the tip of what looks like a futuristic electric toothbrush start to fur up with ice, I begin to feel a bit queasy. These needles will be jabbed into my face, to freeze and disable - albeit temporarily - the nerve that enables me to lift my eyebrows. Am I mad? Not entirely. Getting the needle: Alice has the Iovera treatment, the latest Botox-alternative to banish wrinkles (its makers claim) This is the 'world's first toxin-free treatment for dynamic facial lines', aka the latest Botox-alternative to banish your wrinkles, which has just launched in the UK. Having followed the treatment's progress for the past year, I've been mad keen to be the first journalist to try it. Instead of injecting toxins into the face, this technique uses 'Focused Cold Therapy' to - literally - freeze wrinkles into submission. It works instantly so, unlike Botox, there's no waiting around for a week to see if your eyebrows will end up wonky. And the results should last for around three months, until the frozen section of the nerve regrows. As with any new procedure that promises to be an alternative to Botox, there has been huge interest in Iovera. Despite the fact that Botox has an impressive safety record and has been used and studied extensively for almost 40 years, it is still not to everyone's liking - usually because people don't want to have a toxin injected into them, even in tiny amounts. Although there are several competing technologies that take the freezing approach, dubbed things like 'cold tox' or 'Frotox', Iovera appears to be the most reputable of them all. So, ignoring the advice I frequently dish out about not trying new procedures before they have been extensively tested, I elbowed my way to the front of the queue. 'Iovera is a good alternative for people who don't want actual Botox,' says Dr Yannis Alexandrides, a well-known Harley Street cosmetic surgeon - he's been on TV's Embarrassing Bodies - and Iovera's head practitioner for the UK. Before and after: After eight cycles, there is little sign of the treatment . He has been conducting official trials on the technique for the past year. 'Overall I'm happy with it,' he says. Ninety per cent of his trial group saw good results, he tells me, but the treatment had little or no effect on the other 10 per cent. Most women in this group were enthusiastic. 'It's amazing!' one has said. 'It's so fast, the results are instant, and my forehead looks really smooth yet natural.' He tells me the procedure, properly known as 'cryoneuromodulation', was created by American company Myoscience, and that its patented 'Focused Cold Therapy' procedure has already received Food And Drug Administration approval for pain relief in the U.S. FDA trials for the cosmetic, wrinkle-freezing aspect of the technique are into their final stages. He shows me the sleek Iovera device with those needles sticking out at the end. These needles are inserted into the skin near the path of the nerve that controls the frontalis, the muscle that raises the eyebrows. To chill the nerve, liquid nitrogen is passed into the needles (but not the skin). Dr Alexandrides presses the button to demonstrate and I watch aghast as the probes fur up with ice. Am I being stupid to try this at such an early stage? I canvass opinions from experts in the beauty industry, who sounded notes of caution. 'The three mainstream Botulinum toxins [Botox, Azzalure and Bo-Coture] work so well and so consistently that regular users have no compelling reason to switch,' says Wendy Lewis, an adviser on cosmetic surgery and skincare. Especially to something that will last no longer and is no less expensive. She adds: 'The real potential of this technology lies in treating pain and headaches.' Cosmetic dermatologist Dr Sam Bunting was even less enthusiastic. 'This is not a treatment you can easily fine-tune,' she says, 'because you're inhibiting the nerve, rather than targeting individual muscles. That's a bit like attacking the tree at its trunk to get an apple off a branch. 'Botulinum toxin has become such a sophisticated treatment that we can reshape brows, widen the eyes and minimise facial asymmetries, while preserving natural movement. 'Because Iovera currently only treats the frontalis muscle, the only muscle that lifts our eyebrows up, the risk of ending up with a heavy, angry-looking, dropped brow and upper eyelids seems high. Iovera seems like a retrograde step.' I have had Botox on and off for the past decade and have a love/hate relationship with it. I love the way it can smooth lines and make my face look fresher, but hate not being able to move my forehead. So I end up having just a bit in between my eyebrows, and leave the horizontal lines on my forehead to their own devices. I have a gut feeling that I ought to stick with the devil I know, but curiosity gets the better of me. Before he can start my treatment, Dr Alexandrides has to pinpoint the correct nerve pathway, using a TENS machine, used for pain-relief, that stimulates nerves with electric currents. He hits the right nerve, and my eyebrow starts to twitch. Next come pinprick injections of lidocaine, a local anaesthetic to numb the area. And then the probe. I feel only a small amount of pressure as the needles are plugged into my skin. Deep freeze: Though Iovera may not use any toxins (unlike Botox), Alice recommends holding off on using the treatment until more is known about its efficacy . When the chill-down cycle starts, it feels painful, rather than cold. Not agonising, but the 60 seconds that the cycle lasts seem long. My eyebrow can still move as normal, so Dr Alexandrides delivers another dose of focused cold a fraction further along the nerve pathway - but I still can't see any difference - and moves to my left side. There, it simply doesn't work. After six cycles, Dr  Alexandrides goes back to the right side. One more cycle and my right eyebrow can't move at all. I wiggle my eyebrows, and only one responds, Roger Moore-style. Back on the left side, two more shots fail to subdue the eyebrow. Dr Alexandrides has to leave it as eight cycles is the maximum dose - though there is no bruising and little trace of the treatment, apart neat prong-marks vanishing into my hairline. Does this happen often? Apparently not - only one in ten of Dr Alexandrides' trial group complained of slight asymmetry. To my own eyes, I look bizarre, but over the next week, before I go back to have another two cycles of treatment which quell my left brow, no one notices  - not my family, or the beauty editors I work with, or even the cosmetic practitioners I see at the industry's big annual shindig. Even good old Botox has left me looking lop-sided in the past. But, now I've had both sides successfully treated, I will have a poker-face, or at least a poker-brow, until September. Or longer, if some experts are to be believed. While the people behind Iovera insist the nerves grow back, critics have warned me that this nerve damage could be permanent. So, should you try this treatment? My honest advice is not yet. The technology is fascinating and Iovera may yet become the best wrinkle-fixer since time began, but right now, it's still early days. Iovera treatments cost £500 from Dr Yannis Alexandrides, 111 Harley Street, London W1, 111harleystreet.com .","Instead of injecting toxins into the face, Iovera freezes wrinkles .

"She is famed for her flawless complexion and at the age of forty she doesn't have a wrinkle in sight. And while Gwyneth Paltrow hasn't succumbed to any plastic surgery like many of her tinsel town friends, she is not averse to using products and treatments and has lately admitted to using Thermage - dubbed 'the ironing treatment' - to keep her wrinkles at bay. The A-list actress said: 'I don't mind a few wrinkles and freckles. I had this laser treatment recently, Thermage, and it took a couple of years off my face but I haven't had any plastic surgery yet.' Beating the wrinkles: Gwyneth Paltrow has admitted to having a laser treatment called Thermage that helps beat her wrinkles . The cosmetic treatment, that is also favoured by the likes of Amanda Holden and Kim Cattrall, helps tighten and smooth the top layer of the skin by plumping up the lower layers. The aim of Thermage is to boost the levels of the collagen in the lower layers of the skin to create a tightening effect. However, unlike lasers and tools such as the Dermaroller (a roller with lots of little needles on it), Thermage aims only to 'damage' the lower levels of the skin, and not the top level, which it does by using radio waves that trigger the collagen production. Dr Rita Rakus is reportedly Amanda . Holden's preferred doctor to use for the treatment. Her London clinic . has been using Thermage for more than five years, treating more patients than anyone in Europe. Dr Rita Rakus said: 'Thermage is a radiofrequency skin tightening treatment that heats the deepest layers of your skin to help tighten existing collagen and stimulate the body’s natural renewal of collagen. Fellow fans: Amanda Holden and Linda Evangelista are also reportedly fans of the non-invasive treatment . 'It’s perfect for targeting wrinkles and fine lines around the mouth, eyes or forehead, and further on in the ageing process Thermage is great for decreasing hooding in the eye area, tightening loose jowls and creating definition in the jawline, as well as firming up sagging skin under the chin. 'This creates subtle, natural looking results like smoother, tighter skin, softened wrinkles and lines and an overall younger looking appearance, without having to go under the knife.' But it doesn't come cheap. Patients who want their face treated have three options - full face (£3,900), half face (£2,900), or just eyes (£1,900). Craze: Could Thermage be the new, less intrusive answer to Botox? Gwyneth says she has Thermage but no plastic surgery as of yet . But the process, which works in a . similar way to a microwave oven, has some worrying potential side . effects from facial burns to scarring. Dr Rakus said: 'Most people will see optimum results after about six months, but some people, who have poor circulation, and those with very sun-damaged skin, can have a slower response, so a top-up treatment can help. 'People say it hurts, but to me it just tingled and felt a bit like I'd had sunburn. It's given me the results of a facelift without having to go under the knife,' she added. Amanda and Gwyneth are certainly convinced, and they're not alone. Another Thermage fan is supermodel Linda Evangelista, who said: 'For me, it's for enhancement, like hair colour or make-up.'","Thermage boosts levels of the collagen in lower layers of the skin .

"A South Korean woman has been accused of 'ruining her face' after 'before' and 'after' shots of her plastic surgery procedure spread online. The unnamed woman, allegedly a reporter on a South Korean TV channel, has undergone jaw surgery in order to achieve the dainty heart-shaped face desired by many east Asian women. South Koreans currently have more plastic surgery than in any other country according to recent figures, with the craze particularly popular among 19 to 49-year-olds. The result of the procedure is an unusually pointed chin, and the reactions on a Japanese online forum did not hold back. Before and after: The South Korean woman looks drastically different after undergoing plastic surgery . One used wrote: 'Someone please tell me this was Photoshopped!' while another quipped that 'it looks like you could plow a field with that chin,' RocketNews24 reports. Another asked: 'Is it really possible to taper someone’s chin that much? 'She really doesn’t know what true beauty is.' South Korea is the world's largest market for plastic surgery, with one in five Seoul women having gone under the knife. The most popular surgical procedures include double eyelid surgery - which reduces excess skin in the upper eyelid to make the eyes appear bigger, lipoplasty - which uses high-frequency sound waves to eliminate fat - and nose jobs. The popularity of surgery, particularly among the young, has been blamed by some on a desire to look more 'western' fuelled by an obsession with celebrity culture. The young woman, allegedly a reporter on a TV channel, is one of thousands of Koreans who have had surgery . Drastic move: The woman is compared to a goblet in a photograph uploaded to a Japanese online forum . On the nonsurgical front, Botox and laser hair removal remain firm favourites, a 2012 report said. It appears the woman in these pictures have undergone drastic jaw surgery, a high-risk operation which involves re-aligning the jaw and shaving off parts of the bone to create a 'heart shape'. It is usually a last resort solution to correct facial deformities where people have been unable to chew properly due to an excessive over or underbite, but has become popular in South Korea. A small face with a 'V-shaped' chin and jawline is considered a mark of feminine beauty in much of East Asia, along with a high-bridged nose and big eyes. The ideal: Many surgery-obsessed East Asian women strive to achieve the look of anime characters such as Sailor Moon, with a heart-shaped face and big eyes . South Koreans have more plastic surgery than any other nation according to figures released last year. Those in the Asian country have more treatments per members of the population, with one in every 77 turning to the knife or needle. The figures, from the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (ISAPS), show that in 2011, 15 million people across the globe turned to plastic surgery to enhance their looks. While the popularity of cosmetic surgery in South Korea may come as a surprise to many, the industry there is in fact booming. Last year, 20 per cent of women aged 19 to 49 in the capital city of Seoul admitted to going under the knife. One of the most popular surgical procedures is double eyelid surgery - which reduces excess skin in the upper eyelid to make the eyes appear bigger and make them look more 'Western'. It is believed that the rise of the country's music industry is behind the boom, and many patients visit clinics with photos of celebrities, asking surgeons to emulate American noses or eyes. Singer PSY, whose song 'Gangnam Style' became a global hit, said his record label had urged him to get plastic surgery.","South Korean woman's drastic change shocks online forums .

"Union official Kathy Jackson sobbed as she described being forced into a mental hospital as the stress of taking on corrupt union boss Michael Williamson took its toll. Ms Jackson broke down as she gave evidence to the royal commission into union corruption, describing how she was committed to a Melbourne psychiatric hospital in September 2011, a week after finding a shovel on her doorstep in an apparent death threat. 'I have never been under such immense pressure or stress in my whole life,' the Health Services Union national secretary said. Scroll down for video . Kathy Jackson (left), pictured here with ex-radio broadcaster Michael Smith, broke down in court as she described the immense pressure of taking down corrupt union boss Michael Williamson . 'I now understand what drives people to do certain things.' Ms Jackson was discharged from the hospital after four days and resumed her campaign to expose Williamson's corruption, despite advice from her doctors to walk away. Williamson was jailed for seven and a half years after being found guilty of fraud in March of this year. The 60-year-old must serve five years before he is eligible for parole. Earlier on Wednesday, Ms Jackson said her suspicion Williamson was crooked 'crystallised' after visiting his 'palatial' holiday home, but she was worried about reporting him due to his power. In January 2011, Ms Jackson and her children went to the jailed former Labor president's new retreat at Brightwaters, near Lake Macquarie. 'It was this occasion which crystallised my suspicions of corruption,' she told the commission in Sydney. 'I perceived that Mr Williamson and his family enjoyed a lifestyle that could not be sustained on his legitimate income.' Williamson was jailed in March for seven and a half years on fraud charges . All of Williamson's kids had been to private schools, 'there was bordered herringbone hardwood parquetry throughout ... a high-end audio visual system built into the room... and four European fridges' in the 'palatial' lakeside property, Ms Jackson said. There was also talk of building an in-ground pool and kabana, and buying a boat. Ms Jackson said she asked Williamson what he would do if his lake view was blocked by a house being built next door. 'He said 'oh don't worry about that. We've bought the place next door as well,' Ms Jackson said. Despite her concerns Williamson's opulent lifestyle was funded by corruption, Ms Jackson said she 'agonised' for months about whether to report her boss. 'I felt conflicted as I knew I had a duty to do something about the corruption I was witnessing, however Mr Williamson's power and standing within the ALP and the Labor movement made me hesitant to take any action without real evidence,' she said. Ms Jackson had tried to obtain the unions financial records several times, but they were never released to her, outside meetings, on grounds they were commercial in confidence, the commission heard. Fears that she would suffer similar treatment dished out to Mark Hardacre, another HSU official who made allegations against Williamson, also kept Ms Jackson silent. Jackson (left) spoke of her struggle obtain union financial records and her concerns Williamson's lifestyle was funded illegitimately . 'Everybody knew that if you took on Mr Williamson he destroyed you financially,' she said. 'That is what Mr Williamson did to Mr and Mrs Hardacre.' Meanwhile, HSU NSW secretary Gerard Hayes disputes Ms Jackson's evidence, saying she 'never presented documentary evidence of Michael Williamson's corruption to me.' 'I formed my view of Michael Williamson's corruption completely independently of Kathy Jackson,' he said in a statement to AAP. 'I paid a great price for standing up to Michael Williamson, sacrificing my job, suffering abuse and living with uncertainty for a considerable period. I look forward to having the chance to tell my story at the Royal Commission.' The hearing continues.

"Bernie Ecclestone has no doubt Formula One will be making its debut in Russia in early October. Earlier this week FIA race director Charlie Whiting gave the Sochi Autodrom circuit the green light to stage the inaugural event that runs from October 10-12.

As far as Ecclestone was concerned, the discussion on Russia merely signaled it was business as usual for the 83-year-old who has run F1 for almost four decades. Standing accused: Ecclestone agreed a settlement of $100million (£60million) to end his bribery trial . Such control, however, came under severe threat with the trial that could have resulted in him being imprisoned for 10 years if found guilty.

"Proudly wearing their pristine white kits bearing the red rose, the England rugby union team pose for a photograph before a match against their arch-rivals Scotland in March 2014. They won the crunch international 16-15 and a month later defeated France to clinch a Grand Slam in the Five Nations Championship. But after playing for their country, five of this team would go on to die for it - slaughtered in the Great War. Now their tragic stories have been pieced together in a book commemorating the lives and deaths of every rugby union international killed in the 1914-18 conflict. Team: Back row, left to right: Alfred Maynard, Arthur Dingle, Bungy Watson, Cyril Lowe, Sidney Smart, G Ward, Joseph Brunton, JE Greenwood.

He . spent two years combing sporting and military records to identify . players who fought in the 'war to end all wars', which left almost . 908,000 British and Commonwealth soldiers dead. Lt Alfred Frederick Maynard: Hooker. Died on the first day of Battle of Ancre 1916, having survived being shot in Gallipoli. Captain Arthur James Dingle: Wing. Killed during disastrous second attack at Scimitar Hill 1915. His body was never found. Surgeon James Henry-Digby 'Bungy' Watson: Centre. Died when the HMSHawke was sunk by a German submarine in 1914. 500 men perished in attack. Lt Ronald Poulton­-Palmer: Captain. Died on the Western Front, close to Belgium border in 1914. Reportedly said he would 'never play at Twickenham again' as he died. Lieutenant Francis Eckley Oakeley: Scrum half. Died on HMS D2 submarine when the vessel was rammed and sunk in 1914. Some fought at sea or in the air, but many experienced the horror and bloodshed of the trenches on the Western Front. Mr . McCrery found 140 players from nine teams who died in battlefield. Most . were from England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand or . South Africa but some represented France and the USA. Of . the 15 England players pictured in this poignant photograph taken . before the Calcutta Cup game against Scotland at Inverleith, north of . Edinburgh, a third did not survive the war. The . skipper, Lieutenant Ronald Poulton-Palmer, led an unbeaten side in the . two season's before the outbreak of war in August 1914. In . the last Test match - a 39-13 victory over France in April 1914 - the . centre scored four tries. He was hailed one of the greatest players in . the world. He was killed by a . sniper close to the Belgian border in 1915, five weeks after arriving . on the Western Front. It was reported that his last words were, 'I shall . never play at Twickenham again'. Surgeon James 'Bungy' Watson, who played centre, served with the Royal Navy on HMS Hawke. In . September 1914, the warship was blown up by a German submarine while on . patrol. She sank in eight minutes, with the loss of  500 men. Captain . Arthur 'Mud' Dingle, a flying winger, died during a disastrous attempt . to capture Scimitar Hill, an offensive during the Battle of Gallipoli, . in August 1915. His body was never found. Lieutenant . Alfred Maynard, who played in the scrum at hooker, died on the first . day of the Battle of the Ancre in France in November 1916, the final . large British attack of the bloody Battle of the Somme.

England rugby internationals killed included burly forward Lieutenant . Commander Arthur Harrison, a serving naval officer who played against . Ireland and France that season. He fought in the sea battles of Heligoland Bight in August 1914 and at Jutland in 1916. He . died heroically in 1918 taking part in a raid on Zeebrugge, an . audacious mission by the Royal Navy to blockade the German-held port. He . was killed leading a landing party against heavily-defended enemy . positions, for which he was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross. Captain . Robert Pillman played in the France match, replacing his brother, . Charles, who had broken his leg in the previous game against Scotland. The . flanker was killed in July 1916 during the Battle of the Somme, on the . parapet of a German trench, while trying to bring his men back from a . night raid. Mr McCrery . discovered that some players died of disease, while others, traumatised . by the conflict, committed suicide. Others survived the conflict went on . to fight in the Second World War. He said: 'I have a real interest in the Great War and Rugby Union - both inherited from my father. 'I think it would be a tragedy if, after 100 years, these great men are forgotten. Killed: 'Bungy' Watson was posted to HMS Hawke (pictured). In September 1914 the ship was blown up and sunk in eight minutes by a German submarine, killing 500 .

"With their fur dyed bright colours and cut into shapes to look like different animals and insects, this is the latest trend for pets in Russia. A salon is offering the unusual styling to four-legged friends - and even claims the animals enjoy having it done. In this intriguing footage, Daria Gotz, the owner of a salon in Yekaterinburg, shows off a cat that's been styled to to look like a dragon - and a dog that resembles a bumblebee. Buzz cut: This dog has had its hair dyed yellow and black to look like a bumblebee . It is not made clear whether chemicals in the dye could be harmful to the animals, although salon owner MsGotz claims that they are pet-friendly. She told Liveleak.com that the dyes are made from natural botanical extracts, adding: 'Those dyes which we use are absolutely pet-friendly and producers claim that they have a healthful effect on the animals' coat. 'The dyes are made from natural botanical extracts, they are Korean.' Ekaterina Aidimirova, the bee-dog's Bettie owner, said: 'It was boring so we decided to make our dog bright, summery, adorable, and dyed her hair like a bee - a colourful look.' According to reports, the dye remains on the coats for several months until it grows out. Puss the magic dragon: This cat has had its fur trimmed and dyed a bright green to look like a dragon . Dangerous: The RSPCA says that dyeing animals sends out an 'extremely worrying message' While the owner of the pet beauty salon claims that the dye is not harmful and maybe even beneficial for the animals' health,  reports detailing the health risks of the procedure exist. A spokesman for the RSPCA told MailOnline that animals should not be painted or dyed for cosmetic reasons. He said: 'This could have potentially fatal consequences. Bee-dog:  Bettie's owner said that the dog looked 'boring' and so she decided to make it 'adorable' 'Pets could potentially find being held and restrained whilst the dyeing process is undertaken very stressful. 'Cats are highly fastidious creatures and will groom any substance from their coats to keep themselves clean. Having an unwanted substance in their coat could lead them to ingest the dye. 'Our pets are living creatures and dyeing them in this way sends out an extremely worrying message that they could be viewed as novelty accessories rather than as intelligent, sentient animals,' he added.","A pet salon in Yekaterinburg, Russia, offers extreme image overhauls .

"Jailed: Ali Ehsan has pleaded guilty to sexual assault after groping a young woman on a bus . A doctor from Pakistan has been jailed after drunkenly assaulting a young woman whom he had followed off a bus. Ali Ehsan had arrived in Britain just a month before the attack, which took place when he had been drinking heavily because he was away from his family during the Islamic festival of Eid. The married 31-year-old sat next to the woman and put his hand on her thigh, then followed her when she alighted from the bus. He grabbed her and sexually assaulted her, at which point she kneed him in the groin and ran away. Ehsan, a junior doctor at the Royal Bournemouth Hospital, was caught after police issued CCTV images of him on the bus during the incident on August 10. He pleaded guilty to sexual assault and was given an eight-month prison sentence at Bournemouth Crown Court. A judge heard that Ehsan had left his family for the first time a few weeks earlier after he landed the prestigious hospital job. His defence lawyer said he was 'a fish out of water' in Britain and was not used to drinking alcohol. Anita Gibson-Lee, prosecuting, said that the incident took place on a night bus on the outskirts of Bournemouth around 11pm. Caught on camera: Ehsan was arrested after police released CCTV images of him riding the bus . 'While on the bus, the victim first thought she was being subjected to a pick-pocket,' she said. 'The male put his hand down by her pocket and was touching her thigh.' She said the woman got off the bus early, but Ehsan followed her before carrying out the assault. 'Once off the bus, he then asked the woman where they were and offered her a cigarette before beginning to walk along with her. 'He grabbed her hand. She tried to pull away but he put his hand inside her sleeveless top. He swung her around. 'She said she attempted to escape but he grabbed her again and put his hand down her pants.' Ehsan walked away after the woman, in her early 20s, lashed out at him. Doctor: Ehsan was working as a consultant cardiologist at the Royal Bournemouth Hospital, pictured . Tom Horder, defending, said Ehsan had been drinking on the second night of Eid al-Fitr, the festival which marks the end of Ramadan, because he was upset at being away from his family during the festivities. Ehsan claimed the victim had whispered 'follow me' as she left the bus, and had told him he would have to pay to touch her. Mr Horder said: 'He was somewhat isolated. He was a fish out of water in Bournemouth. He'd never before left Pakistan and he lived a very conservative lifestyle there based around his family. 'He was without the usual social cushion provided by friends and family. In order to occupy himself, he started drinking. This is something completely alien to him both religiously and culturally. 'He fully understands and knows that being drunk is in no way mitigation but it does play a part in explaining how he became involved in that way on the night in question. 'Not only was he drinking at the time the offence was committed, he was at a particularly low ebb in life. It was the second day of Eid, a time when family comes together.' Ehsan will leave Britain after serving his prison sentence, so the judge opted not to impose a deportation order. A spokesman for the Royal Bournemouth and Christchurch Hospitals NHS Trust said: 'Mr Ehsan had only just joined the Trust and had therefore been working under supervision. 'All of our medical staff undergo a rigorous employment process with strict reference checks.'","Ali Ehsan groped woman then followed her off the bus and assaulted her .

"Not proud: William Lietzau has said Guantanamo's detainees should have been legally designated as prisoners of war and held in Afghanistan, or taken to American prisons if charged . The Pentagon official in charge of . Guantanamo Bay has admitted that if he had his time over, he would have . argued that the notorious detention camp should never have been built. William . Lietzau, America’s Deputy Assistant Defence Secretary for Detainee . Affairs, told The Mail on Sunday in an exclusive interview that . Guantanamo’s detainees should have been legally designated  as prisoners . of war and held  in Afghanistan, or if charged with crimes, taken to . prisons  in America. Mr . Lietzau – who, after three and a half years in his job, last week . announced he will be stepping down to take a private sector job in . September –  added that the best way for President Obama to close . Guantanamo would be to announce that the ‘war’ with  Al Qaeda is over. Under . international law, this would end any justification for continuing to . hold prisoners who had not been charged  with crimes. Lietzau’s . words will be seen  as explosive, because alone of senior officials who . serve the Obama administration in this field now, he played a key role . in creating Guantanamo under George W. Bush. As . a senior military lawyer from early  2002 to mid-2003, he designed the . Guantanamo ‘military commissions’ – special tribunals set up to try . terrorist suspects. These . have proved a dismal failure. Their rules have repeatedly changed, and . more than a decade after five men accused of plotting 9/11 were . captured, their case is bogged down in pre-trial hearings which have no . end in sight. Mr . Lietzau said that if he were advising the Bush administration now, ‘I . would argue that detainees should be kept in Afghanistan, or, if moving . them is necessary, then into the United States. If I could change one . thing in Gitmo’s past, I would have called them prisoners of war from . the beginning.’ That, he said, would have meant . their legal status would have been clear from the outset. They would . also have been covered by Common Article Three of the Geneva Convention, . which was not applied to Guantanamo detainees until a Supreme Court . decision in 2006. Mr Lietzau played a key role in creating Guantanamo under George W. Bush . Many . legal critics say that it was America’s failure to recognise Geneva . after 9/11 which opened the road to torture and prisoner abuse. Mr . Lietzau admitted: ‘There were people who were treated badly, and this is . not something we are proud of.’ However, . he insisted such abuse had stopped, saying that some detainees had . become adept at making false allegations. ‘They know that  we look into . every credible allegation, and that absorbs an enormous amount of . manpower and effort .  .  . With Gitmo, the amount of deceptive smoke . overwhelms the tiny amount of fire from years ago.’ He declined to be drawn as to whether . anyone should still be prosecuted and tried under the military tribunal . system he helped create. Guards sit in a tower overlooking Guantanamo detention camp in May 2007 . But . he added if any more detainees beyond the six currently facing military . commissions were to be charged, it might well be better to do this in . ordinary federal courts. ‘They have many advantages, such as the number . of offences which can be prosecuted in them.’ Lietzau . agreed that restrictions imposed by Congress on releasing or . transferring detainees have ensured that progress towards closing . Guantanamo has ground to  a halt. The . answer, he said, was take a more radical step. ‘Just like you can’t . kill your way out of this war, you’re not going to transfer your way out . of Gitmo. ‘The really hard question is, “How do you end this war?” Once you do, we legally have to let them all go, other than those we prosecute.’ He . said Bush’s term ‘the global war on terrorism’ had suffered from a lack . of clarity, suggesting that it might be effectively limitless. ‘The . struggle with terrorism is not going to end. But we do have to end the . legally cognizable armed conflict with Al Qaeda, a specific . transnational group. ‘Arguably, . if the war aim of diminishing Al Qaeda’s ability to mount a certain . level of attack has been achieved, we could declare an end to . hostilities and return to dealing with the threat as a law enforcement . matter.’","William Lietzau had key role in creating Guantanamo under George Bush .

"Apple has officially announced that September 10 will be the date it launches its much anticipated new iPhone 5s. The event will take place at 10am Pacific time (5pm GMT) at the Apple Campus in Cupertino a week today and according to rumors will see the unveiling not only of new and improved smartphone but also for the low-cost iPhone, dubbed the 5C. The 5S will reportedly come with a new and improved camera and in different colored options, while the iPhone 5C will feature a plastic backing but remain essentially the same technology-wise as the iPhone 5. The firm sent out invites today to the . press featuring the phrase, 'This should brighten everyone's day' along . with a graphic depiction of multi-colored dots, which has led some to . suggest indicates the new iPhone 5 will come in a variety of colors. Launch Date: Apple has officially announced the launch date of September 10 for its new iPhone 5S . Indeed, the September 10 is due to be a bumper day for the Cupertino firm, with the announcement of iOS7, the first major overhaul of its mobile OS. And the other highlights of the show will most likely include more details about iTunes Radio, which should launch for U.S. users on September 20th, along with iOS7. As next week's Apple iPhone event draws nearer, new images of what is rumoured to be the iPhone 5C - boxed up and ready to be shipped - have been leaked online. The photos, released by Chinese site iapps.im, show rows of the phones, with what is thought to be plastic casing, in pastel blue, pale yellow and powder pink. Apple is rumoured to be releasing the iPhone 5C as a cheaper alternative to its upcoming iPhone 5S model at an event on September 10. Before the event, experts predicted that Apple was also working on a 'candy-coloured' plastic version of its iPhone 5 handset and expected it to cost around £320. Leaked photos, pictured, showed the device with a matching wallpaper and case colour . The photos have since been removed by the Chinese site on the request of a 'relevant party', according to reports from Engadget. In the images, each of the phones are also shown with a wallpaper in a corresponding colour. Rumours around Apple potentially launching two new handsets at an Autumn event surfaced in June. They claimed that the California-based company wanted to launch a low-cost version of its iPhone 5 handset to compete with rivals Samsung. It will be the first time in Apple's iPhone history that the company has unveiled two handsets in the same month. It . was originally dubbed iPhone Mini, then iPhone Lite, and then leaked . pictures from WeiPhone showing plastic cases suggest it could be called . the iPhone 5C - with the C standing for colour. The cheaper handset is expected to be made of plastic to keep costs . down and may be sold in a range of colours including white, black, pink . and blue. The photos have been removed by the Chinese site on the request of a 'relevant party', according to reports. In the images, each of the phones are also shown with a wallpaper in a corresponding colour, pictured . According to analyst Brian White from Topeka Capital Markets, the iPhone Mini could be made of plastic and could cost as little as £63 ($99). Other prices put it much higher at £260 ($400) and it is likely to be closer in price to Apple's iPhone 4. Apple does not comment on future products before its launch events. Mark Gurman, a journalist for Apple fan site 9to5Mac wrote: 'Because of the uncertain track record of . the source of the image and the image’s overall low quality, it is . difficult to judge if the images are legitimate.' He continues that they do, however, mirror the technique of matching a wallpaper to the outer casing as seen in 2012 during Apple's release of the iPod nano. Other leaked images of the phone have shown the case in dark red, blue and green. Rumours around Apple potentially launching two new handsets at an Autumn event surfaced in June. They claimed the company wanted to launch a low-cost version of its iPhone 5 to compete with rivals Samsung. It will be the first time in Apple's iPhone history that the company has unveiled two handsets in the same month . If the iPhone C follows suit with the iPod nano design, it may be released in red, pink, yellow, blue, green, black and grey as well as white. The cheaper iPhone will be an entry-level device to go with the high-end iPhone 5S, which is expected to come in gold, black and white, have a fingerprint scanner, dual-flash camera to improve the quality of photos, and a faster processor. Rumours claim Apple's event will take place on the September 10 and the phones will be on sale around 10 days later, as has been the case in previous years. Any devices launched will run Apple's latest iOS 7 software and U.S. models may also feature the new iTunes Radio. Chinese site ETNews believes Apple could discontinue the iPhone 5 to focus solely on its rumoured, upcoming new models. Earlier this year, industry analyst Brian White from Topeka Capital Markets claimed Apple was working on a low-cost handset. Dubbed iPhone Mini, iPhone Lite and now iPhone C, the new handset could come in a range of colours, be made of plastic, have a 3.5inch screen and a 5MP camera. Prices being quoted range from £63 ($99) to £260 ($400). Apple is also believed to working on large-screen device for its iPhone 6 model. The iPhone 6 could have a 4.7-inch screen. There may also be a 5.7-inch screen iPhone model due next year. Early rumours claimed the iPhone 5S was expected to be released on September 13, with the cheaper version due at the start of October. Production problems were said to have pushed this date back, meaning the iPhone C would have been released before the high-end iPhone 5. In August, the Wall Street Journal claimed suppliers in Asia had said Apple recently asked for prototypes of screens that are larger than 4-inches for the iPhone. It is also said to be testing larger 13-inch iPad displays. This would make a jumbo iPad more than three inches bigger than the current model.","Tech giant announces official launch date for iPhone 5S .

"GCHQ is allowed to spy on British citizens’ use of Facebook, Google and Twitter without an individual warrant because the firms are based overseas, it emerged last night. To the fury of civil liberties groups, Charles Farr, the head of the Government’s Office for Security and Counter Terrorism, said the sites are classified as ‘external communications’. This means that they are not subject to the strict rules that govern information posted on websites based in Britain. Scroll down for video . GCHQ is allowed to spy on British citizens' use of Facebook, Google and Twitter without an individual warrant . In these cases, a person’s activity will normally only be monitored if there is evidence of a link to terrorism or serious crime and a targeted warrant is issued, signed by a minister. Mr Farr said entries on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and web searches on Google – as well as webmail services such as Hotmail and Yahoo – are considered external communications because users send information overseas. Data can therefore be collected under a broader warrant not signed by a minister. The policy was revealed in papers which form part of a continuing legal battle with campaign group Privacy International (PI). PI said it  ‘patronises the British people’. James Welch, of human rights group Liberty, said: ‘The security services consider that they’re entitled to read, listen to and analyse all our  communications on Facebook, Google and other US-based platforms. ‘If there was any remaining doubt that our snooping laws need a radical overhaul, there can be no longer.’ GCHQ (pictured) said all its work 'is carried out in accordance with a strict legal and policy framework' Mr Farr did not reveal the extent to which GCHQ uses its power to intercept these  external communications. But, in a statement, GCHQ said all its work ‘is carried out in accordance with a strict legal and policy framework which ensures our activities are authorised, necessary and proportionate’. The rules governing the policy are contained within the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, passed by Labour in 2000. The legal challenge, which has been brought by PI, Amnesty, Liberty and six other national civil liberties organisations, was a response to revelations made by Edward Snowden about the UK’s digital surveillance. The details contained in Snowden’s cache of documents – stolen when he worked for the US National Security Agency – led to accusations from the Guardian and others of a programme of ‘mass surveillance’. Mr Farr also revealed that, in its foreign intelligence operation, the NSA ‘touches’ approximately 1.6 per cent of the total data carried over the internet and selects 0.025 per cent of that for review. In other words, U.S. analysts – who go on to share their findings with intelligence agencies in the UK – look at only 0.00004 per cent of the world’s internet traffic.","Sites are classified as ‘external communications’

"An 81-year-old Florida woman who was arrested last week for repeatedly feeding black bears at home after being warned to stop by a judge multiple times is being held in jail without bond. Mary Musselman from Sebring is facing charges ranging from violating probation to battery on a law enforcement officer. Mrs Musselman, a retired gym teacher who worked at the local middle school, is described her as gentle-hearted, sweet and someone who is harmless. She is also an animal lover, but therein lies her downfall. Scroll down for video... Jailed: 81-year-old Mary Musselman, a retired gym teacher from central Florida is behind bars after feeding bears bowls of dog food despite being told not to on several occasions . Ignored: Florida resident Mary Musselman didn't listen, officials said. The authorities had warned her multiple times not to feed the black bears coming onto her property . No sign of stopping: Mrs Musselman would feed the bears 17 to 18 bowls of dog food at a time. The bears loved it and kept coming back. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission hated it and kept coming back, too . Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission officials told ABC Action News the trouble with Mrs Musselman began last year when they had to euthanize a black bear she kept feeding. 'Feeding bears results in bears losing their fear of people,' explained Gary Morse from Florida Wildlife Commission spokesperson. Once bears learn a particular behavior, they cannot be relocated because the animal's natural instincts are disrupted. Wildlife Officers even spent time to educate Mrs Musselman about the dangers of feeding wildlife showing her educational videos and leaving her with information  pamphlets. 'She told us she wasn't going to stop,' Mr Morse recalled. After several more warnings in November, FWC officers went back to her property after hearing she had been feeding two more bears. Source WFLA . Risky: They went to great lengths to explain to her why she shouldn't give the wild animals food, said FWC spokesman Gary Morse. They brought her informational videos and pamphlets, had conversations with her . Problem: Feeding bears results in bears losing their fear of people. After they get used to living around humans and getting food from them, relocating them does not solve the problem . Officers came back with more educational videos and told her that she would be visited weekly. After being summoned to appear in court in December, a judge ordered her Mrs Musselman to stop feeding all wild animals, however just before Christmas, at least three bears were being given large amount of food with up to 18 bowls of dog food being left out for them. A judge found her guilty of two counts of feeding wildlife and she was placed on probation for one year. Just before New Years Eve, Mrs Musselmen was once again found to be feeding bears and she was arrested. 'Unfortunately, she didn't heed the warnings,' Mr Morse said. When FWC officers arrested Mrs Musselman, she threatened to them. 'Feeding wildlife puts the community at risk from property destruction to possible danger of life and limb,' Mr Morse explained. Mrs Musselman reportedly told officers she had to feed the bears or they would starve to death. 'She didn't want to accept that fact that they'd be fine without her...they hibernate when there is no food,' Mr Morse added. Some of Mrs Musselman's former students over the the past forty years gathered outside her home and prayed for her. They have tried to bail her out but she is being held without bond. Many say her behavior is out of character. They want to get her back home as soon as possible because her husband is dying of cancer. Mrs Musselmen is not slated to appear in court until March 3rd.","Mary Musselman put out 17-18 bowls of dog food at a time for black bears .

"Tamir Rice, 12, was fatally shot by police in Cleveland after brandishing what turned out to be a BB gun . A Cleveland officer was less than 10 feet away when he fatally shot a 12-year-old boy carrying a pellet gun near a playground, police said Monday. A surveillance video of Tamir Rice's last moments before he was shot on Saturday has been shown to representatives of his family, after they declined to watch their son's shooting. Tamir Rice, was confronted Saturday by officers responding to a 911 call about a male who appeared to be pulling a gun in and out of his pants. The 911 caller said the gun was 'probably fake,' then added, 'I don't know if it's real or not.' Deputy Chief Edward Tomba said Monday that he didn't know whether a dispatcher shared that information with responding officers. The president of the Cleveland Police Patrolmen's Association has said the officers weren't told the caller thought the gun might be fake. Tamir, who died Sunday, had an 'airsoft' gun that appeared indistinguishable from a real firearm. Airsoft guns fire spherical plastic pellets and have orange tips to show they aren't real firearms, but police said the one the boy had didn't have the bright safety indicator. They say the boy was told to raise his hands and was shot when he pulled the pellet gun from his waistband, though he hadn't pointed it at police or made verbal threats. 'Our officers at times are required to make critical decisions in a split second,' Chief Calvin Williams said. 'Unfortunately this is one of those times.' Scroll down for video . Shooting: On Sunday, Tamir's father, Gregory Henderson,said the youngster had his whole life ahead of him when he was gunned down outside Cudell Recreation Center. Above, the BB gun that Tamir was carrying . Scene: Wiping away tears, he said: 'He had his whole life ahead. To be 12 years old, he doesn't know what he's doing. Police, they know what they're doing.' Above, investigators are pictured at the scene of the shooting . Tomba said surveillance video of the shooting is 'very clear' about what occurred, but he wouldn't discuss details of what it shows. Police didn't release the video publicly because it is evidence in the investigation and because they want to be sensitive to the family, the community and the officer, who is distraught, officials said. The two officers involved in the shooting were put on administrative leave under standard procedure. Police haven't publicly identified them. Cleveland police Deputy Chief Ed Tomba, right, and Chief Calvin Wiliams brief reporters Monday on the investigation . The Cleveland Plain Dealer reported that the officers are a first-year rookie and a 10-year department veteran. Cleveland Police Chief Calvin Williams  said he spoke to the officer who shot the boy last night: '[He is] holding up pretty well but is broken up about this,' Williams said, adding that the officer 'didn't want to do this, but had to protect himself.' The shooting has led to an investigation of the officer's use of force. It also contributed to a state lawmaker's plan to propose legislation requiring all BB guns, air rifles and airsoft guns sold in Ohio to be brightly colored or have prominent fluorescent strips. Too young: Mr Henderson added that he was distraught over the death of his 'superhero', Tamir (pictured), whom he described as a keen basketball player who was tall for his size, polite and 'very artistic' The police department has collected surveillance video and other evidence and will present it to the county prosecutor's office, the newspaper said without citing a source. It said after reviewing the evidence prosecutors will present the case to a grand jury, which will decide whether the officer was justified in using force against the boy. Once the investigation is complete, the case will be presented to a grand jury to decide whether any criminal charges should be brought, Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Timothy McGinty said. An attorney for the boy's family, Timothy Kucharski, said Tamir went to the park with friends Saturday afternoon, but he did not know the details of what led to his shooting. He said 'an innocent boy was shot and killed' by a rookie officer. According to 9 Action News both of the officers are white. Kucharski said: 'This is not a black and white issue. This is a right and wrong issue. This is not a racial issue. 'This is about people doing their jobs the right way.' 'I don't want to make a rush to judgment,' he said. Kucharski said he wants to talk to witnesses himself and get more facts. 'We're ultimately going to find out what happened,' he said. Distraught: 'I'm trying not to cry about the situation but the situation hurts,' he told WKYC.com. Above, Mr Henderson - who did not wish for his face to be revealed - speaks to reporters following his son's death . Distraught: One of Tamir's relatives is pictured weeping on the ground after hearing of Saturday's shooting . On Sunday Tamir's father Gregory Henderson said the youngster had his whole life ahead of him when he was gunned down. Wiping away tears, he said: 'Who would've thought he would go so soon? He had his whole life ahead. To be 12 years old, he doesn't know what he's doing. Police, they know what they're doing.' He added that he was still shocked at the death of his 'superhero', whom he described as a keen basketball player who was tall for his size, polite and 'very artistic'. 'I'm trying not to cry about the situation but the situation hurts,' he told WKYC.com, adding that he wished police had Tasered his son instead of immediately shooting him. On Sunday, Tamir's family and friends - some of whom had been holding a vigil at the hospital for the youngster - were spotted bringing posters, candles and teddy bears to the area. 'I went to church today and I said a prayer for him and, as soon as I come home, he's dead,' said Kerby Williams, who lives near the scene of the shooting. On Monday, Cleveland's website was hacked and a YouTube video purporting to be from the hacker collective Anonymous was posted referencing website shutdowns and the shooting. City spokesman Daniel Ball said the city couldn't confirm who shut down the site. He said the city was adding extra security measures to prevent a repeat shutdown before restoring the website. State Rep. Alicia Reece of Cincinnati announced Sunday that she will introduce legislation to require all BB guns, air rifles and airsoft guns sold in Ohio to be brightly colored or have prominent fluorescent strips. It is modeled after a bill signed by California Gov. Jerry Brown. Reece said she is introducing the bill in response to the fatal shootings of the boy and 22-year-old John Crawford III. Crawford was fatally shot by police August 5 after a man called 911 to report that Crawford was carrying a gun in a suburban Dayton Wal-Mart store. Police said they believed the air rifle Crawford had picked up was a real rifle and that he didn't respond to commands to drop it. A special grand jury concluded police officers' actions were justified.

"Severe amnesia: The mystery man has told police he suffers from a disorder called dissociative fugue . A man with severe amnesia who believes his name is David or Tony has been found sleeping on the streets, having forgotten his identity. The mystery man has told police he suffers from a disorder called dissociative fugue - a condition often connected to some form of traumatic experience which can cause loss of memory. He was brought to the attention of detectives last September after appearing to be out of place sleeping rough in Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire. Having spent four months trying to discover his identity, police now want the public to help. He believes his name is either David or Tony Thorpe and that his date of birth is October 5, 1955 - making him 58 - but a thorough search of both police and NHS systems has drawn blanks. The stranger said he thought he was from Rotherham, South Yorkshire, but was not sure and also thought he could have connections in Blackpool, Lancashire. The man is well-spoken and has a northern accent which could be from either the Yorkshire or Lincolnshire area. Authorities hope this clue could help unlock the secrets of his past. Police officers said the mystery man is not a person who sits begging on the street and that he is not wanted for any criminal offences. Humberside Police Detective Chief Inspector Paul Welton said: ‘This is very rare case in which somebody will come to an area, and have no idea who they are and if they have any family. Appeal: He was brought to the attention of detectives last year after appearing to be out of place sleeping rough . ‘We have not been able to establish how the man came to stop in north-east Lincolnshire, however we are doing all we can to help him find his family and friends. ‘The man is no longer sleeping rough and is being supported by the police and a number of agencies. He does not drink alcohol and does not take any form of drugs or medication.’ DCI Welton added: ‘This is a genuine case of somebody who really does need to the help of the public to return home to his family and his friends. ‘Anyone, who may think they can help this man find out who he is should call Humberside Police as a matter of urgency. We want to all we can to help him but we can't do that if somebody does not come forward to tell us who he is.’","Mystery man tells Lincolnshire police he suffers from dissociative fugue .

The slang phrase - short for 'laugh out loud' - hit the headlines last month when it emerged that jailed rock star Watkins had used it to make light of his vile crimes, which included the attempted rape of a baby. Scroll down for audio . Outrage: Fearne Cotton, right, played a jingle featuring the phrase 'mega lolz' which was used by her ex-boyfriend Ian Watkins, left to make light of his vile crimes . Slogan: Watkins used 'mega lolz' as a catchphrase for his band Lostprophets, printing it on a range of T-shirts . Children's campaigners criticised the BBC for allowing the phrase to be broadcast to an audience of millions, saying it could be 'highly distressing' to those listening. The jingle advertises Radio 1 and includes DJs and listeners talking about why they like the station. After pleading guilty to 13 child sex offences, Lostprophets singer Watkins, 36, sent a message to a fan joking about the offences. 'I am going to put a statement out just to say it was mega lolz,' he said. 'I don't know what everyone is getting so freaked out about.' Ex: Miss Cotton has been criticised for using the phrase associated with her former lover Watkins . The former rock star, who dated Ms Cotton in 2005, was sentenced to 29 years in prison and another six years on licence. Two women who allowed Watkins to abuse their young children were also jailed alongside him. Lostprophets had previously used 'mega lolz' as a slogan, performing in front of a huge backgroup painted with the words. Watkins also designed T-shirts sporting the phrase - which fans snapped up after his imprisonment in a twisted tribute to the singer. Last week, he launched an appeal against his sentence, using taxpayer-funded legal aid to pay for his court bid. Artwork: The slogan became the band's catchphrase and was used in set designs and on merchandise . Sara Payne, a leading campaigner for . children's protection, told The Sun: 'It will be highly distressing for . anyone preyed upon by Watkins to hear these words used light-heartedly . on morning radio. 'After what happened with the Jimmy Savile scandal, the BBC should know better.' A spokesman for the BBC said: 'The term is a commonly used colloquialism amongst young people and the trail reflected this.' Miss Cotton, 32, a former children's TV presenter who has fronted the Radio 1 morning show since 2009, was last month forced to apologise after accidentally broadcasting swearing via an open microphone.","Phrase 'mega lolz' appeared in jingle on DJ's Radio 1 show on Monday .

"MPs have called on the Government to prevent tax money being used for an appeal by one of the killers of soldier Lee Rigby. MPs have reacted with outrage to what they claim is an attempt by Michael Adebolajo to use the courts for ‘jihadi grandstanding’. At his trial, Adebolajo admitted the killing and said: ‘I am a soldier of Allah, and jihad sometimes entails killing the enemy.’ Footage from ITV NEWS showing Michael Adebolajo during the attack on Lee Rigby in Woolwich . If judges hear Adebolajo’s appeal, his barristers will be entitled to claim thousands of pounds in fees from the Court of Appeal. Tory Rob Wilson MP told The Mail on Sunday: ‘This man hacked another man to death in front of cameras. 'There simply cannot be any grounds for appeal and any sensible system would not allow itself to be played in this way.’ He added: ‘If it is open to such abuse, then it must be urgently reformed.’ Victim: Adebolajo, together with Michael Adebowale, 22, mowed down Fusilier Rigby (pictured) in a car, before hacking him to death in Woolwich, south east London, in May last year .

However, Adebowale (right) was sentenced to . a minimum of 45 years in jail . His comments follow a call by Tory MP David Nuttall for a Commons debate on payments in ‘hopeless’ appeals used to promote a terrorist agenda.

"The woman appointed by David Cameron to get problem families back into work pocketed £8.6million last year – most of it from the taxpayer. Emma Harrison - who lives in a 20-bedroom 'posh commune' with 11 close friends and their families -  paid herself the huge dividend from her firm A4e, which makes all its UK income from state contracts. The payout is up 300 per cent on the year before even though MPs say the company’s record on job schemes is ‘abysmal’. Training fortune: Emma Harrison, who was appointed by David Cameron in 2010 to help get problem families back into work, paid herself an astonishing £8.6m in a dividend from her firm A4e last year . Labour’s Margaret Hodge described the fees paid to A4e as ‘an outrage’. Another Labour MP said the dividend was a reward for failure. Mrs Harrison was made ‘families champion’ in December 2010 to advise on getting 120,000 troubled households in work. Her boast that she could find jobs for the long-term unemployed won her a string of lucrative Whitehall contracts. She became even more prominent in the aftermath of last summer’s riots and, in December, the Prime Minister hailed her as an inspiration. Home: Thornbridge Hall is a sprawling 20 bedroom Gothic Mansion in Derbyshire's Peak District . ‘She has real ambition for these families and I know we can count on her to help drive this campaign forward,’ he said. The dividend is especially embarrassing for Mr Cameron because he has called on firms dependent on taxpayer money to exercise ‘restraint’ at a time of austerity. Labour MP Julie Elliott said: ‘David Cameron claims he believes there should be no such thing as reward for failure. Abysmal record: MPs were told that Mrs Harrison's firm had missed . its target of getting 30 per cent of people on the previous 'Pathways to . Work' programme into a job only managing a success rate of nine . per cent . ‘But today it emerges one of his own . advisers has rewarded herself dividends worth millions of pounds despite . the abysmal record her company has for delivering government contracts. ‘This . case raises serious questions over the credibility of this Government . when it comes to ensuring there are no rewards for failure.’ Details . of the massive payment were revealed during a hearing of the Commons . public accounts committee into the Government’s flagship Work Programme. Fair pay? A spokesman for A4e claimed Mrs Harrison's payout was in line with that of a successful entrepreneur who took risks . A4e is one of the main contractors and receives payments for helping the long-term unemployed find a job. Half of its work is subcontracted to charities, generating millions in management fees. MPs voiced astonishment at the size of the payment to Mrs Harrison, and questioned why the firm had continued to win contracts despite the ‘abysmal’ record. The company even received a share of £63million in ‘termination fees’ when the DWP ended a previous back-to-work programme in which the firm was involved and replaced it with a new one. MPs were told that A4e had missed its target of getting 30 per cent of people on the previous ‘Pathways to Work’ programme into a job. The committee heard the success rate was 9 per cent. The company last night claimed a 24.2 per cent final figure. Despite missing its targets the firm was taken on to run five lucrative contracts. Mrs Hodge, Labour chairman of the committee, described the fees as an outrage. She said the dividend payment contrasted sharply with the ‘meanness’ the company displayed toward the charities that carry out much of its work. During terse exchanges with the firm’s chief executive Andrew Dutton, she said: ‘You and Emma Harrison have to accept that there will be a different interest in the remuneration and profits made because the profits you make come from the taxes that ordinary, hard-working people pay.’ Tory MP Steve Barclay said the size of the payment raised serious questions about whether the public was getting value for money from the Work Programme. He questioned whether the Department for Work and Pensions should continue paying management fees that are not linked to performance. ‘It’s not A4e’s fault if they get paid for poor delivery. What matters is whether we are getting value for money. That is why we need change,’ he added. Mr Dutton defended the vast payout to Mrs Harrison, saying: ‘The dividends we pay to shareholders reflect the personal risk that they have. ‘Having owned a company for over 21 years, at times they have had to effectively put their own homes and mortgages on the line.’ In a statement last night A4e said that although it had missed its targets its performance was better than the industry average. A spokesman said Mrs Harrison’s payout was in line with that of a successful entrepreneur who invested and took risks. Opulent: Mrs Harrison shows off her lavish mirrored music room . She calls her 20-bedroom mansion a posh commune – with good reason. Emma . Harrison shares the Gothic pile with husband Jim and their four . children as well as with 11 close friends and their six children. Talking . about the unusual arrangement, she has said: ‘Why on earth would I like . to live like a princess in an ivory tower, it would just be ridiculous. I share my money. Me and my husband have managed to be successful . financially and my friends have done other things. Between us it’s a . team effort. ‘They often call me the donkey, when I . complain that I’m knackered they just say, “Go on donkey, go back to . work.” It’s the running joke between us all.’ The . families pay into a kitty for bills and groceries, but Mrs Harrison . covers any shortfall. There is a pool of cars for communal use, . including a BMW, Audi, Mercedes and a Subaru. The . Peak District house, which cost £5million a decade ago, comes with a . butler, two lakes and 100 acres of land. The family rents it out for . film shoots, corporate events, weddings and private celebrations. Mrs . Harrison, who speaks with her native South Yorkshire accent, is . something of a rags-to-riches story. She grew up in Nigeria and . Sheffield, the family moving wherever her father’s training company took . them. After achieving ‘mediocre A-level . results’ in Sheffield, she gave up on her dream of being a doctor and . studied engineering at Bradford University. At the age of 23, her father left England for Germany, putting his daughter in charge of the training company. The collapse of the steel industry in Sheffield allowed her to pioneer ‘training solutions’ for unemployed mill workers. By 1991, she had founded Action for Employment, which later became A4e. She . is now worth an estimated £70million, putting her at 968 on The Sunday . Times rich list. A4e is worth £80million, with her stake put at . £68million. Her wealth has . given her the best in life and, while searching for her dream home in . 2002, she told estate agents to ‘Think Chatsworth House’. The . estate agent thought she was a time-waster but her home bears many . similarities to the Duke of Devonshire’s enormous pile in Derbyshire. ‘I . had visited the house as a kid on a course to learn Russian when it was . an educational study centre and I loved it,’ she said. ‘I used to . imagine myself sweeping down the stairs in a long red dress. So I bought . it.’ Around the same time, she also bought a £3million mews house in central London, and a £75,000 holiday home near Skegness. Her husband, whom she married in 1993, is also a businessman and set up the successful Thornbridge Brewery a few years ago. In 2006, she was filmed for the Channel 4 programme Secret Millionaire.","MPs question why firm continued to win contracts despite 'abysmal' record .

"Have you ever tried camping over a ravine with nothing but a few ropes and wires between you a 420-foot drop? Well, as these fearless friends will tell you... the experience is highly in-tents. Slackliner Andy Lewis and 11 of his friends swapped picnics for parachutes on a daredevil adventure aboard a 'midair campsite' in Moab, Utah. Highly in-tents: Slackliner Andy Lewis and seven of his friends swapped picnics for parachutes on a daredevil adventure aboard a 'midair campsite' in Moab, Utah . Complex job: The majority of the system was connected on the ground and needed 12 people rigging at the same time to pull it into the air . He said: 'The best thing is that you are high enough to parachute off the net. You can literally step out of your tent, fall off the net, and fly away. 'I am totally intrigued by the height. It is frustratingly scary and quite distracting. 'It causes a unique and challenging focus that becomes addicting.' Lewis, who goes by the nickname Sketchy Andy, even slept in the tent overnight with his fiancee Hayley Ashburn. 'I brought out dinner, pillows, beer, smokes, and movies,' said the 26-year-old from San Francisco, USA. 'We had a wonderfully romantic and incredibly memorable and beautiful night.' Monkey madness: Lewis came up with the 'net' plan four years ago but it was only this year that he managed to finally build it - with the help of fellow adventurers the Moab Monkeys . Fun in the air: The crew took turns highlining, base-jumping and falling 350ft on a rope swing . Lewis, who hit headlines when he performed alongside Madonna at the 2012 NFL Super Bowl, came up with the 'net' plan four years ago. But it was only this year that he managed to finally build it - with the help of fellow adventurers the Moab Monkeys. The majority of the system was connected on the ground and needed 12 people rigging at the same time to pull it into the air. The slacklines were 55m, 60m and 70m long and the entire network - weighing 300lbs - took 24 hours to secure. They named it the 'Space Thong' - because of its resemblance to a giant G-string.

'It is a fabricated emotion of a near-death experience. It lets you know what is important in your life. 'Mostly I think about my life and the lives of my friends. I think about keeping everyone safe mostly, then combining that with the most dangerous activities. 'It's a wonderful paradox indeed. Falling down 350ft on a couple of ropes can be deadly. But when done right, it can be amazingly fun, and a reliable way to stay safe while being able to feel the fear of falling.'","Andy Lewis and 11 friends built their own 'midair campsite' in Moab, Utah .

"An embattled London council is being probed over its links to Muslim extremists, a report reveals. Tower Hamlets council is already under investigation for alleged fraud after mayor Lutfur Rahman doubled recommended funding to Bengali-run charities in an apparent attempt to buy favour. But now a leaked government report suggests  the mayor and his finance minister, Alibor Choudhury, have links to Islamic extremist groups, including one seeking to set up a Sharia state in Europe. Lutfur Rahman, the mayor of Tower Hamlets, is being investigated over allegations of fraud and has now been linked to extremist groups, as has Alibor Choudhury, his finance minister . A document handed to The Sunday Telegraph says that three community centres owned by the council, or by their housing authority, were used for meetings of radical groups including al-Muhajiroun, the banned Islamist terrorist organisation founded by Omar Bakri Mohammed and Anjem Choudary . A third was used by political hate group Hizb ut-Tahrir and 'may still be' in use, according to the report which was prepared for David Cameron in 2013. Another cause for concern is the council's £2million of funding given partially to the East London Mosque, which previously held a telephone Q&A with al-Qaeda leader Anwar al-Awlaki. They have links to the Islamic Forum of Europe which is seeking to set up a Sharia state within Europe. The council's new finance minister, Alibor Choudhury, has close connections to the organisation as do other senior council officers. Earlier this week police and investigators were called to the council to assess whether Mr Rahman had deliberately doubled funding to Bengali-run charities in the hope of buying favour. Mr Rahman was also accused by Panorama of increasing public funding to Bangladeshi and Somali groups from £1.5 million to £3.6 million in the face of officer recommendations. The mayor has denied all the claims, which he claims are motivated by racism and Islamophobia. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has sent inspectors into the council to work alongside police . Speaking to Mail Online, a DCLG spokesman said: 'It is a matter of public record that Ministers have long been concerned about a worrying pattern of divisive community politics and alleged mismanagement of public money by the mayoral administration in Tower Hamlets. 'Separately, Ministers are also minded to use their new powers under the Local Audit and Accountability Act 2014 to take action against councils continuing inappropriate spending of taxpayers’ money, and Brandon Lewis has written to Tower Hamlets about this.' The spokesman added that, as the report was leaked, the department would not be commenting on allegations of extremism. A spokesman for Tower Hamlets council said: 'Tower Hamlets has a strong record in partnership working with many different agencies in tackling and preventing extremism from Office of Security and Counter Terrorism (OSCT) funded projects to our Prevent programmes, receiving Home Office sign off to working with Stonewall on faith and sexuality. 'Our approach to diversity, equality and social cohesion has been recognised by our peers and is reflected in the ‘Excellent’ rating received from the Local Government Association.' An earlier version of this article referred to the Osmani Trust as a Muslim-only youth group. We have been asked to make clear that the Osmani Trust is not faith based.","Tower Hamlets council already being investigated over suspected fraud .

"An Australian TV network has broadcast an interview with a man who claims to know where the body of murdered British man Peter Falconio was dumped in the Australian outback. The mystery of where the Yorkshire man's remains lie after he went missing in a remote part of Australia has endured for almost 13 years. Seven Network's Today Tonight programme claims a witness to the aftermath of 28-year-old Falconio's July 2001 murder has only just come forward. Scroll down for video . Body found? Nearly 13 years after murdered British tourist, Peter Falconio and girlfriend Joanne Lees were attacked in the Australian outback, his remains may soon be located . This is the outback Australian location where murdered Brit Peter Falconio's body may be located . The key to locating Peter Falconio's body may lie in this country well on a rural Australian property . The man, who lives in an isolated region of Australia, had not closely followed the case of Falconio and his girlfriend, Joanne Lees, who managed to escape their attacker and hide in the freezing desert before making it to safety. It was only when Bradley John Murdoch was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2006, that the man made the connection with what he had witnessed. Acting on a tip-off, Today Tonight reporter Frank Pangallo and a team travelled to the alleged location. The location was named last night as Neutral Junction Station in the Northern Territory,  just over a mile from where Falconio disappeared. The orange Kombi van in which Peter Falconio and girlfriend Joanne Lees were touring the Australian outback before he was murdered and his body dumped . Footage of their journey to the site, was screened on Australian television. One of the team was a woman who is an expert in locating hidden burial sites. In a world exclusive story, Paul Jackson told the Seven Network's Today Tonight that an unnamed man had seen a vehicle closely resembling that of Falconio's convicted murderer, Bradley Murdoch, on the station 80 minutes after the assault on Falconio and Joanne Lees. Mr Jackson said he believed Falconio's remains - now a skeleton - lay at the bottom of a well on the Neutral Junction property. Footage of the police search in July 2001 for Peter Falconio shows the windmill above the Neutral Junction well in the background. Bradley John Murdoch (left) is serving a life sentence for the murder of Peter Falconio, who with his girlfriend Joanne Lees (right) was attacked on a remote stretch of highway in the Australian outback in 2001 . Torrential downpours prevented the Today Tonight team from completing their search for Falconio, but the investigation to find him will continue next week when the outback rains have cleared. Mr Pangallo said the location was probably overlooked by the Northern Territory police searching for Peter Falconio's body because it was 'so obvious'. Peter Falconio and Joanne Lees, both from Yorkshire, were touring Australia in an orange Kombi van in July 2001, when a man flagged them down on a lonely stretch of the Stuart Highway, around 180 miles north of Alice Springs. After Falconio got out of the car to speak with the man, Lees heard a shot and then a person later identified as Bradley Murdoch handcuffed her before she managed to escape into the bush. She never saw her boyfriend again. Police later found a pool of blood on the road, but were never able to locate Falconio's remains. Murdoch was later convicted of Mr Falconio’s murder, largely on DNA evidence which included a spot of Joanne Lees's blood on his T-shirt. Murdoch is serving a life prison sentence in the Northern Territory and has always protested his innocence, saying he cannot reveal where Falconio’s body is because he wasn't there. He lodged an appeal against his conviction last December, claiming crown prosecutors coached Lees in giving her evidence at his trial.","A man claims he may know where the murdered Brit's body was dumped .

"Charlie Wheeler's loved ones knew him for his love of tank tops, hatred of haircuts and a taste for the silly - and now, thanks to an uplifting obituary, the whole country knows him that way, too. In a tribute that has since become an internet hit, his family has painted a hilarious picture of the 60-year-old father-of-two who passed away in New Hampshire on November 16. 'Charles ""Charlie"" Wheeler, 60, of Weare, kicked the bucket, bought the farm and ate his last pretzel on Nov. 16, 2014,' the obituary begins. It recalls how he was 'notorious for his numerous sound effects, sense of humor, and easy smile' as well as his skills as a 'house fix-upper' and 'putterer'. Remembered: Charlie Wheeler, 60, pictured, passed away last week - and his wife and two children have commemorated him by writing a hilarious obituary that has since gone viral . 'Charlie's many talents included repairing cars and motorcycles, riding his Harley, barbecuing and hanging around the fire pit,' it continues. 'Best known for his fashion sense, Charlie consistently wore white tube socks, tank tops, shorts, flannel shirts, fleece vests, a sweaty baseball cap, and raggedy, barely wearable sneakers.' It remembers how he loved Christmas, the Three Stooges,  his German Shepherds and feeding the birds but hated snow blowing 'and took such joy in dumping snow on his kids'. 'He was a hard-working man, loyal, silly, kind, gentle, respectful and incredibly generous,' it finishes. The obituary seemed the only suitable way to pay tribute to Wheeler, said his wife of 32 years, Annie Pleatsikas, his daughter Meredith, 22, and son Evan, 26. Charlie, known for his questionable dress sense, leaves behind wife Annie, daughter Meredith and son Evan . 'We did it because we thought it was so appropriate to do something funny and humorous and to paint a picture of him,' his wife Annie told WMUR. 'He was just hilarious.' After his obituary was published, it was shared by people moved by the touching tribute, with hundreds commenting on what a great man he seemed to be. 'I wish I had known you, Charlie,' one reader from Ohio wrote beneath the obituary. 'You are my kind of person....live, love, laugh! I'm sure you will be missed by all who knew you.' 'They always say ""He's in a better place"", but I think Charlie made ""here"" a better place,' another added. Loved: Charlie, pictured with his children, was remembered as a hard-working and loyal man with a great sense of humor. Readers of the obituary commented on how they would've liked to have known him . His daughter, Meredith, added to WMUR: 'People say they were laughing, crying, laughing and then crying more. I think that's a better way to read an obit than crying the whole time.' Annie said she is glad her children are smiling at the happy memories with their father. 'I think in the coming days, it's going to bring us more comfort,' she said. 'They will always remember this.'","Charlie Wheeler's wife and two children penned a touching tribute to the 60-year-old after he passed away last week .

"Hollywood superstars George Clooney and Leonardo DiCaprio have sparked record sales for a diet supplement with men making up two thirds of buyers for the first time. Meratol has sold a staggering 25,000 bottles of its diet pill in the UK in the last two months since it was revealed that the A-listers were among celebrity fans. But for the first time in its six year history, there are more male purchasers than women, who account for 74 per cent of total sales. A-list fans: Veteran actor George Clooney and Hollywood hearthrob, Leonardo DiCaprio . The pills, made from a cocktail of herbal ingredients including cactus leaves, prickly pear and seaweed, claim to speed up metabolism to burn fat while suppressing appetite. Female celebrity fans include actress Eva Longoria and the supplement has been promoted by The Only Way Is Essex favourite Lauren Goodger. But it is the Clooney Effect which is believed to have sparked the sudden sales surge to men recently as they look to shed those post-Christmas pounds. A Meratol spokesman said: 'We usually see a ration of around 55:45 women to men purchasing our slimming aids. 'For the first time in six years we can report a significant change in buying patterns with male customers being our primary customer. Control: Desperate Housewives star Eva Longoria and TOWIE's Lauren Goodger both use the pills . Wonder pill? Meratol is said to help slimmers shed their excess pounds in double quick time . 'It has been reported recently that two thirds of British men are overweight so there is an increased awareness among them in actively taking action to lose weight. 'Women are already aware of such products but when you get fans like George Clooney and Leonardo DiCaprio, it helps raise their profile to a whole new audience of men.' Meratol claims to help shift between three and five pounds a week and was used by The Only Way is Essex star, Lauren Goodger to shed her excess weight. She said: 'I've taken a lot of herbal diet tablets and some can make you feel a bit shaky but on Meratol I don't feel any different. It helps you burn fat and suppresses your appetite.' Dubbed a 'turbo weight loss' supplement, each £35 tub contains 60 pills, enough for a month's use, and is available from the website, meratol.com. Father of two, Darren Hughes, 47, had been piling on the pounds for years thanks to a combination of late night snacks and minimal exercise. At just 5' 10"" tall, the Oxford content writer tipped the scales at 13.5 st, which left him with a BMI of 27.1 - firmly in the overweight category. But the super-slimmer has managed to lose two stone in just 12 weeks, dropping to a svelte 11.5 st, all thanks, he says, to using slimming pills which gave him 'the motivation needed' to do something about his unhealthy diet. Darren said: 'Having always struggle with my weight I heard about Meratol through a friend. 'When I started using it, the pounds came off quite quickly, and the fact that it started to work spurred me on - I'm not the most motivated of people.' Darren, who had gradually gained weight over the years, said the epiphany arrived in his late 30s, when the former runner realised that he was getting too big to keep up with his active children. Svelte: Slimmer Darren Hughes dropped from 13.5 st (left) to 11.5 st (right) in just 12 weeks . But feeling demotivated, he put the problem to one side and managed to convince himself that it would all drop off eventually. It didn't and he became the butt of fat jibes from friends and family. Things changed when a friend's wife suggested slimming pills, and with nothing to lose, he decided to try. A few weeks later, with the pounds starting to drop off, Darren finally felt motivated enough to change his diet and his exercise regime. Having spent years feasting on fried food, microwave curries and crisps, he now chooses to eat a more healthy diet based on salads, healthy sandwiches and fresh vegetables. 'I'm a sucker for pancakes,' he admits. 'Once the kids were in bed, I would snack on junk food late at night and veg out in front of TV. It's an easy habit to get into. 'After I realised the pills were starting to work, I began to monitor what I eat and now I don't snack at all. I still have the occasional burger but now it's a treat. 'I've also started playing golf. I'm not that good at it but it does mean I'm standing on my feet. As long as you do that, you are burning some calories. 'To anyone thinking of trying to lose weight, I would say give it [Meratol] a go. I know different things work for different people but I'm still taking it now and I'm confident I can maintain my new weight.' Breakfast: Weetabix plus an unhealthy extra such as pancakes or bacon .

"Lauren Silverman, the married New York socialite expecting Simon Cowell's baby, had to wait over a year and a half to divorce her husband, sources say. According to a report in The New York Post, Silverman, 36, was holding off on breaking the news about her affair with Cowell until the 10-year mark in her marriage so the terms of her pre-nup would kick in - awarding her $3 or $4 million. 'This is just another example of her going for the money,' a source from Andrew's camp told the Post. Didn't trick him: Sources say Lauren Silverman was told by doctors that she couldn't get pregnant . Long affair: Silverman has been secretly dating Cowell since the end of 2011 or beginning of 2012, but had to wait to break the news so she could get her pre-nup payout . Friends of the Silvermans told MailOnline that waiting until the decade mark before divorcing was 'more lucrative' for Lauren. They also said that Andrew's parents didn't attend their wedding because 'they did not approve of the relationship, they didn't have a good feeling about her and the relationship.' The friends also said they were 'aware of the rumors of other conquests by Lauren.' The Silvermans plan to make their split official early this week. Payout: Friends of the Silvermans said it was more lucrative for Lauren, pictured shopping in the Hamptons, in New York, on Sunday, if she divorced her husband after a decade of marriage . Scrutiny: Silverman wore sunglasses while shopping after it emerged she is pregnant with Cowell's baby . Yesterday, Silverman looked despondent today as she took a break from the crisis talks with her husband to buy some toys for her son. Mrs Silverman, who is pregnant with Simon Cowell's baby, put her hands on the counter of the toy store and stared into space - looking like she had a weight on her shoulders. Her stare was only broken when she saw her son Adam, seven, come to her side and she broke into a smile and stared at him. Despondent: The custody battle over son Adam seems to be taking it's toll on Lauren Silverman - the married socialite expecting Simon Cowell's baby . Lauren had taken Adam away from her $4million home in Bridgehampton, New York as a break from crisis talks with her husband Andrew on her affair with Cowell. They left around 10am in a Range Rover being driven by her handler and drove for five minutes to a nearby shopping center where they went into a shop called Second Star Toys. Lauren browsed for a few minutes before taking a large box of Legos to the counter. Putting on a happy face: Silverman purchased some Legos for her son Adam . She could be heard apologizing to staff for all the attention she was getting and was led out the back door where the Range Rover was waiting. Lauren was dressed casually in a loose fitting white shirt with a red pattern on it, dark-colored shorts and tan gladiator sandals. So much for a vacation: Silverman looked tired and distant as she shopped the Hamptons toy store . A woman who works at Second Star Toys declined to comment after she had left. While Lauren was out Andrew drove off at speed from their home in his Mercedes Gullwing sports car. He declined to comment.

"Princess Ameerah, the former wife of a multi-billionaire Saudi Arabian royal has vowed to fight to win the basic right for women in the kingdom to drive a car, telling MailOnline that it 'can happen overnight'. As a princess with a wonderfully privileged life, she is accustomed to being driven from palace to penthouse in chauffeur-driven limousines. She used one as a guest of honour at the Westminster Abbey marriage of Prince William and the then Kate Middleton in 2011, and regularly socialised with Prince Charles. But now a divorcee, Ameerah, 31, said in an interview that she is currently just as comfortable in her own modest £15,000 Mini Cooper which she drives when she is in Europe and America. Influence: The glamorous princess spoke to MailOnline at the 5th Abu Dhabi Media Summit in UAE last week . Inspirational: Princess Ameerah, right, and Queen Rania of Jordan, left, are powerful drivers of change . Women in her desert kingdom cannot enjoy that simple pleasure and she is determined to see them similarly empowered. She told MailOnline at the 5th Abu Dhabi Media Summit in the United Arab Emirates last week: 'It is my job and duty to use my power and influence to highlight these kind of issues and to try to find solutions. I am offered platforms to speak around the world, and I must use them to try to change things.' Women have been barred from driving in Saudi Arabia since the establishment of the state in 1932 and earlier this year, a woman reportedly received 150 lashes after being caught behind the wheel. But Ameerah is confident that – with a little bit more pressure – the government will lift the ban shortly. She said: 'It will be a hugely important step, and it can happen overnight'. Protests and acts of defiance against the ban have grown in recent years, with women posting videos of them behind the wheel to social media. The latest campaign day was held on October 26. The World Economic Forum’s annual report on gender rights regularly portrays Saudi Arabia as one of the worst countries for women. And the driving ban is a potent symbol of their inferior status. Every single Saudi woman has to have a 'male guardian', typically their husband or father or brother, who has the same legal power over her as a parent has over a child. She requires formal permission for almost all activities, including working, travelling, and sport, and depends on him financially and for housing. Ameerah said: 'I don't believe the ban will go on indefinitely. It will be like the decree calling for 20 per cent of Parliament to be made up of women – a surprising development, but one which happened very rapidly. 'I believe that it is the generation of young people in Saudi Arabia which is going to accelerate change in the country.' Among those 'leading the way', said Ameerah, is Prince Turki bin Abdullah Al Saud, a young royal and Governor of the Riyadh Province who is also a Leeds University PhD candidate. Privilege: Princess Ameerah, pictured with her former husband Prince Alwaleed bin Talal at The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's wedding, and right with Malala Yousafzai, said: 'It is my job and duty to use my power and influence to highlight these kind of issues and to try to find solutions' Ameerah said Saudi women currently have to employ a driver, and that proves impossibly expensive for many. It can cost up to £340 a month. Of her own driving experiences, she said: 'We still can't officially drive in the cities and towns, but I have driven in the desert many times.' 'I have an international license and drive a Mini Cooper when I am in Europe and America. I find the GPS very helpful,' Ameerah added. 'I do not drive in London or anywhere in the UK, however, because driving on the left is quite confusing.' Ameerah said two wheels could be just as good as four too, adding: 'I ride bikes from time to time.' But even cycling in Saudi Arabia is a pursuit that is severely restricted for women - they can only do so in so-called 'recreational areas', while dressed in full Islamic body coverings and accompanied by their male guardian. An ultraconservative interpretation of Islam means women can only use their bikes 'for entertainment' too, rather than for work or other purposes. These are just the type of restrictions which the Saudi women calling for emancipation want to see lifted. There was good news last month when some of those taking part in a closed session of the Saudi King's advisory council apparently recommended women over 30, wearing no make-up, should be allowed to drive between 7am and 8pm. An official spokesman for the council denied any policies were agreed, but the claims at least provided encouragement. The kingdom is the only country in the world that forbids women from driving, but there has been a positive response to groups of female activists posting pictures and videos of them driving on social media. This is all part of a movement which has seen women ‘taking responsibility for their future’ using new technology, said Ameerah. Speaking to MailOnline about the remarkable transformation in her life, Ameerah said she was coping well from her split from Prince Alwaleed bin Talal - one of the richest men in the world. Raised in a middle-class home in Riyadh, Ameerah famously arranged a short interview with Prince Alwaleed as part of a school journalism project when she was just 18. Defiance: Women in Saudi Arabia have begun to use social media to post videos of them driving in protest at the ban. There are reports that one woman was given 150 lashes for being caught behind the wheel . They were meant to talk for 10 minutes, but got on so well that the conversation lasted for two hours. 'We just clicked,' she said of the now 59-year-old royal, whose vast fortune includes assets such as the legendary George V Hotel in Paris and Plaza in Manhattan, and who is known as the 'Arabian Warren Buffett'. Their marriage, which took place within a year, was very low-key to begin with – it was not even made public until 2009 – but Ameerah was handed the fairytale life of an Arab Princess. But that hit the buffers last year, however, and the hugely glamorous couple divorced early in 2013. They remain 'great friends', with Ameerah also still describing the Prince as 'my mentor'. Ameerah, whose divorce settlement as the Prince’s fourth wife remains undisclosed, has thrown herself into work – especially philanthropic causes, and her production company, Time Entertainment. She also runs Tasamy in Saudi Arabia, a centre for people who want to volunteer for public service so as to 'make their country a better place,' said Ameerah. She is fast becoming one of the most influential Arab women in the world, working closely with world figures including Queen Rania of Jordan, and former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Activists behind the driving rights movement which started in 2011 are part of a larger protest against state oppression, but Ameerah believes the battle is being won. She said: 'Saudi women are doing incredible things – we're making progress all the time.' She has more than a million followers on social media sites including Twitter and Instagram, and sees the web as being hugely important for women to get their message across. Referring to some 83 per cent of under 25s in the Middle East and North Africa who have access to the internet, Ameerah said: 'to be connected is also about being mobile, travelling, working with people globally.' She admitted there were too many inconsistencies in Saudi Arabia, where a substantial part of Parliament is made up of women, but where men and women still have to use different doors to get into buildings. 'The web gives women equal opportunities,' she said. 'Women can set up their business online, prosper and be successful, and they can have a voice too through social media.' Women’s rights have been improving slowly since King Abdullah Bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud came to power in August 2005. He appointed 30 women to the Shura, his advisory council, in a historic breakthrough for Saudi society. This sets the stage for 2015, when a new decree not only allows women to vote in municipal elections for the first time, but they will be able to run for local government office too. Hopes: Ameerah said: 'Saudi women are doing incredible things – we're making progress all the time' Friends in high places: The Princess kisses Chelsea Clinton. Ameerah has been praised by leaders around the world for her efforts in promoting equal rights in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East . Ambitious economic plans have also seen increases in the number of women finding employment in the private sector and going to university. More generally, Saudi women are being recognised as major public figures, rather than individuals who have to stay in the background. One of Ameerah’s proudest moments came in 2011, when, in the same year as Prince William’s wedding, she received the 800th Anniversary Medal for Outstanding Philanthropy from Prince Philip. She said: 'It was truly amazing to receive such an award from the Prince. I really appreciated it coming from a person who has so much experience of life. It was such an honour to speak to him. 'Both the British Royal Family and the British public are renowned for their generosity and good works.' Chelsea Clinton, the only daughter of Bill and Hillary Clinton, has said: 'Ameerah's advocacy on behalf of Saudi women has provided a tremendous contribution to how we think about the rights of girls and women around the world.' Ameerah said her own motto in life is: 'Throw yourself over the edge that you're always scared of. Try being independent; do it your way. You'll love it.'","Ameerah, 31, who divorced £20bn Prince Alwaleed bin Talal last year spoke to MailOnline about her campaign to emancipate women .

"These pictures show the terrifying moment an unconscious skydiver hurtled towards the ground after he was knocked out seconds after jumping from a plane at 12,500ft. Experienced skydiver James Lee, 25, was hit from behind by another skydiver and knocked out, just after he made jumped at the Skydive ground in Netheravon, Wiltshire. He was saved from certain death by two other skydivers who, having seen what had happened, postponed pulling their own cords and instead dived towards Mr Lee, grabbing hold of him and deploying his parachute. These pictures, taken on Mr Lee's head-camera, show the other divers making signs to check he is OK before realising he is not and taking the action that saved his life. Scroll down for video . After he is knocked unconscious, James Lee's head camera captures how he spun round and round, hand  flying in front of his face, while the plane is just a speck (top left) Out of control: Thousands of feet above the ground, Mr Lee's arms flail around as he plummets down .

With the unconscious Mr Lee's blue gloved-hand in the foreground, this picture shows the others' concern . Mr Lee only regained consciousness as he drifted safely down to the ground, where he landed safely and with no memory of what had happened. He said: 'I've been skydiving for five years and this was my 1,050th jump.  There were 12 people in this skydive, with others leaving the plane just after we jump off. 'One of the skydivers who left the plane through the door came out unstable and went into a spin. 'They were falling faster than I was and their shin impacted the back of my helmet with a lot of force, knocking me out.' He went on: 'I am now tumbling through the air uncontrollably and two other skydivers realised something was wrong. 'They chased after me and fortunately I roll into a more stable position - still quickly drifting in the sky. Mr Lee regained consciousness as he floated down, with no memory of the accident . 'At first the other skydivers give basic hand signals that we teach our students to correct their body position and find I am still not responding. 'They manage to get hold of me to try and stop my body tumbling again as we get closer to the altitude where, as a group we separate to deploy our parachutes. 'They signal to the other jumpers to get away as they were unaware of what was happening. They then deploy my main parachute. Once I was clear they deployed their own.' It wasn’t until Mr Lee was under the canopy that he began to regain consciousness, and he landed safely on the ground with no memory of the drama that had unfolded seconds earlier. He was taken to hospital where he was treated for an injury to his head, and then given the all-clear and discharged. Now he says the accident, which happened last July, 'has not put me off at all.' Mr Lee added: 'I am very glad that everything unfolded how it did. 'This is not something you are taught to do or practise for as it is very uncommon. I think my mum and girlfriend are more relieved than I am.' Help arrives: This head-cam shot shows one of Mr Lee's friends grab his arm to steady him before pulling the cord .

"Tana Ramsay joined her husband at the High Court in London today (above) where she said a family feud with her father had been 'distressing' Gordon Ramsay's wife spoke yesterday about the family feud between her husband and father, calling the fight 'extremely distressing'. Tana Ramsay told a judge that her 'dominant' father Christopher Hutcheson had 'systematically defrauded' the chef during his time as chief executive of Gordon Ramsay Holdings. Mrs Ramsay was speaking at a civil claim made by her husband, who is trying to avoid being held liable for the £640,000 annual rent on a London pub bought when Mr Hutcheson was at the helm of the company. Mr Ramsay has accused Mr Hutcheson of using a ghostwriter machine, more commonly used by authors to sign books and photographs automatically, to forge his signature on a document which made Mr Ramsay the personal guarantor for the costly rent of the exclusive the York & Albany . Mrs Ramsay, 40, who married the chef in 1996 and has four children with him, said: 'The knowledge that my father and brother had been systematically defrauding my husband was extremely distressing to me.' She added: 'My father was someone, in my opinion, who was very, very clever at times at giving enough information to satisfy, but never all. 'I think certainly when Gordon asked questions or sort of wanted to know things, sometimes it would be a case of my father keeping him incredibly busy or out of the country with not enough time to be told everything.' Asked by the judge if her father gave the impression that 'Gordon doesn't understand these things and trusts me to look after the financial side', Mrs Ramsay replied: 'Yes, my lord, that would be true.' Mr Ramsay turned the property, owned by film director Gary Love, into a hotel, pub and restaurant. Mr Love has described the chef's attempt to have the signature discarded as 'absurd'. Telling the court she was aware of the ghostwriting machine which could reproduce the chef's signature, Mrs Ramsay added: 'It did not even occur to me that the machine might be used to sign Gordon's signature on anything else.' But she recalled 'the shock on Gordon's face' when the couple's solicitor Larry Nathan, who works for the law firm Mishcon de Reya, told him that the lease for the York & Albany included a clause which would make him the personal guarantor for the rent on the property for 25 years. Christopher Hutcheson was accused of plundering thousands from the accounts of Gordon Ramsay Holdings. Right: Gordon Ramsay and his wife, Tana, pictured arriving at the High Court on Friday . Mrs Ramsay went on to say that her husband said the lease 'takes everything we have ever worked for'. Mr Hutcheson acted as business manager for the Ramsay group of companies until the chef sacked him and Tana's brother, Adam, on the grounds of gross misconduct in 2010. Mrs Ramsay, who also writes cookery books and runs a beauty salon, said she felt that the business had improved since her father and brother left their positions in the firm. She added: 'Since the departure of my father and my brother from the business it has been a huge upheaval, but certainly myself I feel very comfortable with what the company has become. 'Whilst not immediately, it is certainly more transparent and it is on a much more solid basis.' Speaking about her family's estrangement, she said: 'I don't really speak to my father since he left the company unless it is concerning his grandchildren – we certainly don't have any comfortable conversations.' The couple pictured leaving the High Court in London last week. Mr Ramsay is fighting to have his signature on a lease for the York & Albany pub in Regent's Park discarded .

"One of two registered California sex offenders charged with raping and killing four prostitutes confessed to a police detective after his arrest earlier this year, testimony from a grand jury transcript unsealed Monday revealed. Steven Dean Gordon, 45, also told police that he and co-defendant Frank Cano killed a fifth woman who has never been identified. Both men were wearing electronic monitoring devices during the time period when authorities say they attacked the women, although the transcript reveals that Gordon was not being monitored for a roughly nine-day period during which he said he and Cano killed one of the victims. Confession: Steven Dean Gordon, left, has admitted to killing four California prostitutes and another woman who has never been identified, along with his co-defendant Frank Cano, right . Gordon's state electronic anklet had been removed and he had yet to be fitted with a federal anklet, he told Trapp. The confession by Gordon came during an interview that lasted more than 13 hours the day after Gordon's arrest, Anaheim police Detective Julissa Trapp told the grand jury. Both defendants have pleaded not guilty. The transcript contains little new information about the 28-year-old Cano. Trapp reported that Gordon first said Cano didn't know of Gordon's plans to strangle the women. But by the end of the interview, Gordon said Cano had strangled each woman while Gordon punched them in the stomach to 'get the air out faster.' The women were then stripped of their clothes, washed and placed in a Dumpster. The body of the final woman killed, 21-year-old Jarrae Nykkole Estepp of Oklahoma, was found on a conveyor belt at a trash-recycling plant in Anaheim but the bodies of the other three have never been found. Victims: Jarrae Nykkole Estepp, 21, from Oklahoma, left, whose body was found on a conveyor belt at a recycling centre in Anaheim prompted the initial investigation which led to the other cases including Martha Anaya, 28, right . Slain: Josephine Monique Vargas, left, and Kianna Jackson, 20, right, were also raped and murdered . The fifth woman, referenced by Gordon in the interview, has not been identified and the two are not charged in her death. The two were arrested on April 11 after Estepp's body was found the month before. Police believe Cano and Gordon have known each other since at least 2010, when Cano cut off his GPS device and fled to Alabama, where he was arrested with Gordon. Two years later, in 2012, they again snipped off their monitoring devices and boarded a Greyhound bus to Las Vegas using fake names.  The men were arrested by federal agents on May 8, 2012, after a two-week stay at Circus Circus Hotel & Casino, according to federal court documents. Gordon traveled using the alias Dexter McCoy and Cano chose Joseph Madrid, authorities said. Cano and Gordon were previously ordered to register as sex offenders after being convicted in separate cases of lewd and lascivious acts with a child under 14. Gordon was convicted in 1992 and also has a 2002 kidnapping conviction, while Cano's conviction dates back to 2008. Crime scene: Estepp's body was recovered from Anaheim's Republic Waste Services in March . The first woman to disappear was Kianna Jackson, 20, of Las Vegas, who arrived in Santa Ana in October 2013 for a court hearing on misdemeanor charges of prostitution and loitering to commit prostitution. Her mother said she stopped responding to her text messages soon after she arrived. Josephine Monique Vargas, 34, was last seen October 24, 2013, after leaving a family birthday party to go to a store. Martha Anaya, 28, asked her boyfriend to pick up their 5-year-old daughter so she could work on November 12, 2013, but then stopped responding to his messages later that night. Police said she also had a history of prostitution. Estepp's mother, Jodi Michelle Pier-Estepp, said her daughter had a troubled past but was working to turn her life around when she traveled to California to visit her brother and stopped in Orange County along the way. When they were arrested, Cano and Gordon had been living in a car and on the streets. Gordon had a job cleaning cars at an auto body shop in Anaheim.","Steven Dean Gordon, 45, told police he and Frank Cano, 28, killed five women, one of whom has not been identified .

"Barbara Walters acted as a 'adoptive mother' and 'career adviser' to a glamorous former aide of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. In a string of leaked emails between Sheherazad Jafaari . and the celebrated broadcaster, Ms Walters, 82, promised to her help the 22-year-old secure a job on Piers Morgan's CNN show and win a place at Columbia University. Ms Jafaari, whose father is Syria's U.S. ambassador, was one of Assad's closest advisers and one one of three women revealed in an earlier leak to have sent lovestruck emails to the dictator. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Making headlines: Barbara Walters was the first and only American journalist to interview Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in December in the midst of violent uprisings in his country that have left thousands dead . Statement: Sheherazad 'Sherry' Jaafari has said she 'did what any ambitious American girl would do' in helping out her country in its time of need . In one email, Ms Walters told 'Sherry' how she had written to CNN host Piers Morgan and his top producer to . 'say how terrific you are' in hopes of helping her get a job at Piers . Morgan Tonight. The young woman responded, writing 'You can never be a better mom to your adopted child (me).' Messages leaked by Syrian rebels in March show her asking another of Mr Assad's advisers to tell him: 'I love him so so so much and that I miss him.' The leak revealed flirtatious and suggestive emails from three admirers, including a provocative photograph of an unknown woman in white lingerie. Mrs Walters first began dealing with Ms Jaafari when ABC News was in talks to arrange the first and only televised interview for an American network with the Syrian leader. In the interview, Ms Walters pressed the president about the thousands of deaths of Syrian citizens and he denied having issued any formal command for such force. The Telegraph, who published the most recent batch of hacked emails between Ms Walters and Ms Jaafari, reported that the interview was received poorly by Syrian government officials because it ended up being more harsh on Assad than they originally expected. Shortly after, Ms Jaafari emailed Ms Walters in a panic, writing that she was 'in so much trouble' over the interview. A few weeks  later, Ms Jaafari had determined that it was time for her to get out of Syria and join her father in the U.S.- all the while remaining extremely loyal to Assad, who she called 'the Dude'. In other emails obtained by The Guardian in March, Ms Jaafari wrote that 'this man is loved by his people'. Ms Walters and Jaafari continued to talk via email long after the interview aired . Upon her move from Syria, Ms Jaafari applied to Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs, and hope to translate her time working as a press aide to Assad into a staff position at a major American news outlet. Ms Walters immediately dismissed any talk of her working for ABC since it would be a breach of journalistic ethics. Instead, she offered to reach out on behalf of the 'dear girl'. The pair appear extremely close, with Ms Walters signing her emails with ‘hugs’ and ‘love’ and Ms Jaafari promising to bring back jewellery from Syria for her so-called adoptive mother. Their email exchange was obtained by Syrian opposition forces who then passed them on to The Telegraph. Walters signed emails 'hugs' and 'love' Ms Walters emailed Columbia Journalism School professor Richard Wald, former president of NBC News and vice president of ABC News, to sing Ms Jaafari's praises. 'She is brilliant, beautiful, speaks five languages. Anything you can do to help?' Ms Walters wrote at the end of January. Mr Wald responded that while his position at the Journalism School is unconnected to the School of International and Public Affairs, he would do his best to help, saying that 'through the Admissions Office network, I will get them to give her special attention. I am sure they will take her.' The attention did not appear to be enough to help the now-22-year-old, as she was not accepted to the program. Mr Wald's son, Jonathan Wald, is the executive producer of Piers Morgan Tonight, was also the recipient of an email from Ms Walters. She told Ms Jaafari that she wrote to both Jonathan Wald and Piers Morgan on her behalf and passed along her resume for their consideration, even though she was unsure if they had any availability. That specific email was not released. Neither Ms Walters nor Ms Jaafari heard back from CNN or the younger Mr Wald. In the wake of the emails, Ms Walters released a statement expressing her 'regret' for the questionable decision. 'In the aftermath (of the Assad interview), Ms Jaafari returned to the US and contacted me looking for a job. I told her that was a serious conflict of interest and that we would not hire her,' Ms Walters said in the statement. 'I did offer to mention her to contacts at another media organisation and in academia, though she didn't get a job or into school. In retrospect, I realise that this created a conflict and I regret that.'

"Doh! Jailin Turner was jailed after she asked police for help when she was locked out of her home and they found pot plants and bongs after helping her inside . An Iowa woman who was locked out of her apartment was soon locked up in jail after officers who helped her regain entry found pot plants and bongs in plain view, police said Friday. Iowa City police say Jailin Turner is charged with possession of a controlled substance, possession of drug paraphernalia, failure to affix drug tax stamp and disorderly house. To her credit, it wasn't 19-year-old Turner who called police. They say they arrived to her home just after midnight following a call about a woman banging on a window. That woman, police say, turned out to be Turner. She was on a balcony yelling and kicking a window when they showed up. The Iowa City Press-Citizen reports she told them she'd lost her keys. At some point, police claim Turner tossed a plastic deck table off the balcony in their direction. Nonetheless, after an unsuccessful late night call to the building's management, police had a fire crew break into her apartment. There, out in the open, were two bongs police say. Turner then gave police consent to search her home. They found potted plants under grow lights, thy say. Jail records showed she was in custody on Monday. It's unclear whether she has an attorney. Officials also said they found a scale and marijuana grinders. What was she thinking? Police say Turner had two bongs in plain view. She consented to further search, at which time they found two marijuana plants and grow lights as well as other paraphernalia .","Iowa City police say Jailin Turner was banging on her apartment window as she stood helplessly on a balcony when police arrived Friday .

"A mother who set up a website for her murdered daughter ended up being stalked by an internet crank who travelled half way around the world to declare his love, a court heard. Karen Downes, 48, started the site in memory of her 14-year-old daughter Charlene, who vanished ten years ago after being groomed by a child-sex gang. But the court heard it led to her striking up a friendship with New Zealander Mark Bailey. Horror: Karen Downes, left, the mother of murdered teenager Charlene, right, has been stalked by a man who was obsessed with her . He then became so besotted that he saved up enough cash to travel to Britain, before demanding that Mrs Downes leave her husband and family to ‘be with me and  nobody else’. When she refused, he attacked her and pulled her hair during a confrontation earlier this month. Bailey, 27, was given a six-month restraining order and fined £75, plus a £20 victims surcharge, at Blackpool Magistrates’ Court. Last night, Mrs Downes spoke of how the incident had left her terrified. ‘He wanted to see me but got me trapped in an alleyway,’ she said. ‘I became frightened and started to scream. He could have had a knife or anything and he was threatening me. He had shown an interest in my website – the Charlene case – and it snowballed from there. ‘When he told me he was coming over here I thought it would  not happen. ‘I was surprised when he arrived but he wanted me to leave my family and control me, but that was never going to happen.’ Mrs Downes’s daughter disappeared in Blackpool in November 2003. Police believe her body was put in a mincing machine and made into kebabs and burgers sold from a takeaway in the town. Case: Charlene's disappearance was linked to this kebab shop in Blackpool, whose owners were put on trial for her murder although the case against them collapsed . Although two business partners were later tried for her murder, they were acquitted and no-one has ever been held responsible. After setting up the site dedicated to her daughter and the investigation, Mrs Downes chatted to Bailey online for 12 months, Neil Cheesbrough, prosecuting, told the court.The New Zealander then arrived  at the seaside resort seven months ago. He claimed he and Mrs Downes were lovers, but she denied they were having a sexual relationship. The court was told that Mrs Downes ended their ‘affair’ earlier this month and police warned Bailey not to harass her. But two days later, the pair met in Cookson Street in the town. When they started arguing, he  grabbed her hair, which was tied in a bun. Gary McAnulty, defending, said his client believed he was in a genuine relationship with Mrs Downes and had moved from New Zealand to allow it to flourish. The lawyer added: ‘It was slightly bizarre because Mrs Downes is married and lives with her husband. After being warned by police he arranged to meet her to discuss matters and said he loved her. ‘I have had to explain to him she wants nothing more to do with him. It is a sad end.’ Police believe Charlene fell victim to child-sex gangs, centred on  takeaway restaurants in Blackpool, at the age of 12. They claim she  was sexually abused by as many as 100 men in the run-up to her death. In 2007, Iyad Albattikhi and Mohammed Reveshi were tried for murdering Charlene but a jury failed to reach a verdict and a retrial collapsed. They later received six-figure compensation sums for false imprisonment.","Karen Downes is the mother of Charlene Downes, who disappeared in 2003 .

"A judge has ruled that a suspect's confession that he killed missing six-year-old Etan Patz in New York can be used at his murder trial. Pedro Hernandez, 53, has pleaded not guilty to murdering the boy, who disappeared while walking to his school bus stop in Manhattan in 1979, in a case that mystified police for decades. On Monday, Manhattan state Supreme Court Justice Maxwell Wiley ruled his taped confession from 2012 could be used in the case, finding that he was properly advised of his rights and capable of understanding them - although his attorney has insisted that Hernandez was mentally ill. It was only in 2012 that Hernandez, who had been a stock clerk at a store in Etan's neighborhood when the boy disappeared, emerged as a suspect. Pedro Hernandez, who admitted to killing Etan Patz in 1979 in a taped confession, appears in Manhattan criminal court with his attorney Harvey Fishbein in 2012 . Etan became one of the first missing children to be pictured on a milk carton, and the day he disappeared, May 25, became National Missing Children's Day. His body has never been found. After six hours of questioning, Hernandez confessed to the kidnapping on video, telling police he lured Etan to the store basement with the promise of a soda and then choked the boy. He described putting the six-year-old, who was still alive, into a plastic bag, then putting the bag inside a box and dumping it nearby. 'I was nervous; my legs were jumping,' Hernandez said. 'I wanted to let go, but I just couldn't let go. I felt like something just took over me. I don't know what to say. Something just took over me, and I was just choking him.' On the video, Hernandez is dressed in a brown jacket, white T-shirt and jeans, and sits at an empty desk save for a can of Pepsi. He talks about his family and his medical history - he is HIV-positive, suffers back problems and is bipolar. 1979 crime: Pedro Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to murder in the strangling death of Etan Patz, who was one of the first missing persons to be placed on a milk carton . He explains how he killed the child but doesn't remember what the boy was wearing, that Etan had a cap on when he vanished, or that the weather was bad that day. He says he tossed the boy's book bag behind a freezer; no bag was ever found. He does not remember the boy saying anything, and nothing in particular caught his attention that made him choose the boy, he says. 'I just approached to him or I asked him, you want a soda? I said come with me,' he said. 'He didn't say nothing to me. He didn't kick. He wasn't angry. He just kind of stood there, and I just felt bad what I did.' Hernandez's lawyer, Harvey Fishbein, argued his client falsely confessed and lacks the mental ability to understand his rights. He described Hernandez's demeanor on camera as exhausted from hours of questioning; Hernandez had been in custody nearly eight hours when the taping began. 'When those eight hours were finished, he was convinced he had something to do with the disappearance of Etan Patz,' Fishbein said. Unanswered questions: Etan's parents Stan (left) and Julie Patz. Both were in court the day the confession was heard in September, but Julie left the courtroom before the tape with played . The Manhattan district attorney's office says the confession was real and legally obtained. In 2012, police got a lead that brought them to Hernandez, a high school dropout who had worked at a corner store near where Etan disappeared. Hernandez, most recently a resident of Maple Shade, New Jersey, also told police that he confessed before: to his ex-wife, to a friend, and in front of about 15 people during a prayer circle at a church group. In the 1980s, Hernandez allegedly told the group that he had harmed a child in New York. Six-year-old Etan Patz disappeared while walking to his school bus stop in Manhattan in 1979 . 'We were all holding hands and praying,' he said of the church meeting. 'And everybody was confessing, so I confessed. I told them I killed a child.' But no one ever went to authorities and investigators have not pointed to any physical or scientific evidence against Hernandez. At about 70, Hernandez's IQ puts him in the bottom 2 per cent of the population, a defense psychological expert testified during a weeks-long hearing this fall. His lawyer has said Hernandez's medical records mention schizophrenia dating back years, he has taken anti-psychotic medication for years, and since his arrest, he has been diagnosed with schizotypal personality disorder. Its effects on him include 'cognitive and perceptual distortions,' including hallucinations, Fishbein has said. In one of the confessions, Hernandez says he has had visions of his dead mother. A defense psychologist told the court he believed Hernandez would not have fully comprehended what he was agreeing to in saying he understood his Miranda rights. But a prosecution expert differed, noting that Hernandez scored not much below people of average intelligence on a specific test of how well someone understands the function of the familiar Miranda rights warning during police interrogation. 'The evidence convincingly demonstrated that he knowingly waived those rights and voluntarily provided a statement,' Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Joan Illuzzi-Orbon later wrote in a court filing. Hernandez had gone through 11th grade without special education or remedial summer school, represented himself in a prolonged divorce and child support proceeding, participated in his church, and successfully applied for Social Security disability benefits, the prosecutor noted. Etan's parents have not commented.","Etan Patz disappeared while walking to his school bus stop in New York .

"One in 10 London homeowners face spending hundreds of pounds every few years on property valuations because of Ed Miliband’s plan to introduce a ‘Mansion Tax’, it has been revealed. The Labour leader has vowed to impose a levy of up to £15,000-a-year on homes worth over £2million in order to shore up the NHS. More than 100,000 homeowners could be hit immediately by the tax, which is expected to be a levy of 1 per cent. But thousands more families - the vast majority in London - could be forced to pay for valuations of their homes by surveyors because of Britain’s volatile housing market which can see increases of over 20 per cent in a year. House prices are soaring by more than 10 per cent a year, which could drag more and more properties into the 'mansion tax' band . Mr Miliband says the tax will raise £1.3 billion, which will be used to hire thousands of NHS staff. But some 250,000, just under one in 10 of households in the capital, will be forced bring in surveyors to assess whether their property exceeds £2million, according to experts at Knight Frank estate agents. They will also face fines of thousands of pounds if the taxman disagrees with the valuation they submit. Labour has insisted it will not introduce a wholesale revaluation of properties to see how many multi-million pound properties are being bought and sold. Instead, the party is considering a similar scheme to the one developed by George Osborne to target super-rich individuals who buy large houses through businesses, avoiding stamp duty. Mr Osborne’s scheme means those who buy houses through companies have to report to the taxman what the house is worth, with those over £500,000 subject to a tax. A penalty of 30 per cent of the tax owed is imposed if the wrong amount is declared through ‘carelessness’, rising to 100 per cent if it was deliberate. Labour leader Ed Miliband said a mansion tax would raise almost £2 billion which would be used to hire tens of thousands of NHS staff . But critics have raised concerned that thousands risk could be forced to pay the tax unfairly because estate agents are inflating the asking prices of homes. Under Mr Osborne's scheme valuations must be undertaken every five years. A senior Labour source said shadow chancellor Ed Balls was looking at using a ‘similar model’ to Mr Osborne’s. Yesterday it emerged pensioners hit by the levy could see the money taken out of their estates when they die. Labour peer Lord Adonis has criticised his party's 'mansion tax' proposal . Elderly homeowners who do not have the income to pay up front could defer the tax until their death. It would mean that their families could be faced with bills running to tens of thousands of pounds. Only a tiny number of people are expected to be exempted from the tax which, it is feared, could hit the so-called ‘asset-rich, cash-poor’ homeowners who live in properties whose value has soared in recent years but do not have the ready money to pay the levy. Labour MP Karen Buck, who represents Westminster North, told the BBC that one solution would be to offer ‘relief’ to some long-term residents or allow them to ‘defer payments until the property was sold’. A string of prominent London-based Labour MPs have already come out against the levy – which they see as a ‘tax on the capital’. And Labour’s candidates for London Mayor have also opposed the measure, which would disproportionately affect London. Yesterday Lord Adonis criticised the proposal, saying: ‘People whose houses have been inflated into much higher values and suddenly find themselves therefore facing a much higher tax bill, many of whom will not be people of means, we need to play fair by them too.’ Labour say the £2 million threshold will rise each year in line with house price inflation, and the level will be banded so the most expensive properties are levied the most. One estate agent said the policy would suppress the value of homes close to the £2 million threshold. The policy has alarmed MPs in the capital. David Lammy, the Labour MP for Tottenham, said there was a ""big question"" around how houses would be valued. ""If [it is] on current value, then London pensioners living in same home for years will be hit hard,"" he said.","Labour vowed to impose levy of £15,000-a-year on homes worth over £2m .

"A Pennsylvania university said on Monday its president has resigned after he was criticized for comments he made about women and sexual assault. Lincoln University's board of trustees said it accepted Robert Jennings' resignation. The university named general counsel Valerie Harrison as acting president.

He made remarks at an all-women's convocation in September about how false rape allegations can ruin a young man's life. Scroll down for video . Lincoln University's board of trustees said it accepted the resignation of president Robert Jennings (pictured). He made remarks at an all-women talk in September where he appeared to blame them for sexual assault . According to philly.com, Jennings said: ''We have, we had, on this campus last semester three cases of young women who after having done whatever they did with young men and then it didn't turn out the way they wanted it to turn out, guess what they did. They went to Public Safety and said, ''He raped me.'"" He went on: 'Don't put yourself in a situation that would cause you to be trying to explain something that really needs no explanation had you not put yourself in that situation.' He then added: 'Men treat you, treat women, the way women allow us to treat them ... We will use you up if you allow us to use you up.' Then men, he continued, will 'marry the girl with the long dress on'. Portions of the remarks were posted online and some parents criticized them as appearing to blame women for sexual assault. Board chair Kimberly Lloyd announced Jennings' departure in a letter posted to the university's website. The bulk of Lloyd's letter focused on Harrison and the future of the historically black university in rural Chester County, about 45 miles west of Philadelphia.

"Two paintings worth millions of euros by the French artists Paul Gauguin and Pierre Bonnard which were stolen in London in 1970 then abandoned on a train have been recovered in Italy. Gauguin's 'Fruit on a table or small dog' and Bonnard's 'Woman with two chairs' which were taken from a family house in the British capital, were recovered from an Italian factory worker who had hung them in his kitchen for almost 40 years. The Gauguin painting is worth between 10 and 30 million euros (£8million and £24million) while the Bonnard is valued at some 600,000 euros (£500,000), Italy's heritage police said at a press conference on Wednesday. Found... 40 years on: Italian military police stand next to the two paintings by French artists Paul Gauguin and Pierre Bonnard which were stolen in London in 1970 and recovered from a factory worker's kitchen last month . Job well done: Italian minister of culture Dario Franceschini (left) and General of Carabinieri Mariano Mossa shake hands in front of the painting which are worth up to £30million . The paintings turned up in a lost property department at a train station and were sold at auction in 1975 to a worker at a Fiat factory, who bought them for 45,000 Italian lire or 23 euros (£20, equivalent to about £300 today). He hung them on the wall of his kitchen. 'It's an incredible story, an amazing recovery. A symbol of all the work which Italian art police have put in over the years behind the scenes,' Italy's Culture Minister Dario Franceschini told journalists. The paintings were found last month after a lengthy investigation, which began when police received a tip off that they may have been stolen. Investigators trawled through back catalogues of exhibitions from the time of the theft, from which the 1889 Gauguin mysteriously disappeared after it was stolen, reportedly from the widower of a daughter of one of the Marks & Spencer co-founders in Regent's Park, north-west London, according to The Guardian. They then used newspaper reports about the 1970s theft in The New York Times and a Singaporean paper to trace the paintings back to the London-based family. Prized possession: Gauguin's 'Fruit on a table or small dog' is valued between £8million and £24million . Retrieved: Bonnard's 'Woman with two chairs' is valued at some 600,000 euros (£500,000) 'The two paintings were presumably left on a train from Paris to Turin,' said Mariano Mossa, who heads up the heritage police. 'They were bought by an art-loving worker, who hung them for 40 years in his kitchen, first in Turin then in Sicily, after he retired,' he said. According to press reports at the time, the two paintings were stolen by thieves on 6 June 1970 from Kennedy's home in Regent's Park, north-west London. The Observer newspaper reported: 'Three men, posing as a police officer accompanying two burglar alarm engineers last night stole two paintings together worth £155,000 from a house in Chester Terrace, NW London.' The thieves asked for a cup of tea and when the housekeeper returned they had fled with the paintings. The Fiat worker's son, an architecture student in Sicily, discovered the paintings' true value after noticing a Guagin featured in a book he was reading was very similar to those owned by his father. The future of the paintings is unclear. A source told The Guardian that Italian police were liaising with the Metropolitan Police's art and antiques unit. Italy opened a special department to investigate art thefts in 1969, the first in the world, which is situated in a Baroque palace in the centre of Rome's bustling tourist centre. The heritage police manages the largest data bank on stolen art in the world, with details on some 5.7 million objects. Last year, they found a painting by Russian-born Jewish artist Marc Chagall, 'Le Nu au Bouquet,' in a private collector's home in Bologna that had been stolen from a US tycoon's yacht in Italy in 2002. They also investigated the theft of possibly thousands of rare books from the Girolamini Library in Naples, which were allegedly smuggled out and sold internationally by its former director. Mossa said in January that 'the turnover generated by the illegal sale of works of art comes fourth on a world level behind the sale of weapons, drugs and financial products.'","Paintings are by French artists Paul Gauguin and Pierre Bonnard .

"She has never had any trouble getting her sponges to rise – and it seems Mary Berry is just as adept at expanding her bank balance. As the BBC’s Great British Bake Off returns to our screens for its fifth series tonight, the queen of cakes has whipped up an impressive business empire thought to be worth as much as £5million. The 79-year-old’s popularity with viewers is paying dividends, and over the past year she has signed lucrative deals to produce kitchenware, published a string of bestselling books, seen sales of her range of sauces and chutneys soar and been paid to appear at food shows around the country. Scroll down for video . Recipe for success: Great British Bake Off star Mary Berry has whipped up an impressive business empire thought to be worth as much as £5million . And all of this is on top of her estimated £200,000 annual salary for appearing on Bake Off, as well as a further sum for presenting her solo show Mary Berry Cooks on BBC2. Miss Berry, who lives with her husband in a £2million house in Buckinghamshire, has now set up a network of companies to manage the spoils of her growing TV fame. Two of them – Mary Berry Ltd and Mary Berry Merchandising Ltd – were set up in the past eight months and have yet to file accounts. A third, Mary Berry and Daughter, is run with her daughter Annabel Bosher, 42, and made £1.2million last year. Here is a breakdown of her booming  business empire: . Over a 50-year career, Miss Berry has established herself as a respected author with more than 70 cookbooks to her name. But her soaring TV popularity has helped her dominate the bestseller lists, earning an estimated £2.3million in the past eight years. She now writes most of the books with her assistant Lucy Young, and they currently have three – Mary Berry Cooks, Cook Now Eat Later and Simple Cakes – in the charts. Over Christmas, the official Bake Off recipe book beat Jamie Oliver to the top spot, and Miss Berry’s Christmas Collection, Complete Cookbook and Cookery Course all made the top ten. Last year, she published her autobiography, Recipe for Life, and this spring she released two iPad and iPhone cookery apps at £2.99 each.

Since then they have expanded  the range to include a wide range of  sauces and chutneys that are stocked  in supermarkets and delicatessens around the country. Profits have soared from £34,374 in 1999 to £1.2million last year. A bottle of Mary Berry salad dressing costs £3.95, while her ploughman’s chutney is £2.49 and her hollandaise sauce is £1.80. When she is not filming, Miss Berry tours the country giving talks and cookery demonstrations believed to earn her four-figure sums each time. Over the summer, the sought-after chef is set to appear at food fairs in Herefordshire, Hampshire, Chatsworth, Newbury and Bristol, and will open the Royal Horticultural Society’s Wisley Flower Show in September. She has given sell-out talks at Fortnum & Mason in London and is a regular at the Good Food Show, which has events around the country.

"A survey released reveals that a third of men would now describe themselves as vain. One in three men also admitted that they indulge in a beauty treatment at least once a month . The battle for the bathroom in the morning has never been so fraught. The new generation of 30-something men have grown up with the likes of David Beckham and Brad Pitt as style icons, breeding thousands of copycats who no longer see spas as the domain of women. A survey released today reveals that a third of men would now describe themselves as vain. One in three men also admitted that they indulge in a beauty treatment at least once a month to maintain their looks, compared to just one in four women. The most popular treatments are some of the more traditional - 41 per cent of the procedures booked by men are hot shaves, while 33 per cent were taken up with relaxing massages. But achieving a higher level of beauty was definitely key for many - one in ten men admitted to having their underarms waxed and 12 per cent of men revealed they had received a back wax. The TOWIE and Geordie Shore television shows have also had an effect on men's grooming - 15 per cent of men admitted to booking themselves in for a sunbed session. Meanwhile, the survey by lastminute.com showed 16 per cent of men had paid for a facial and 13 per cent had experienced a pedicure. These pamper sessions have become such a way of life for some men that they even book themselves in before important meetings - fourteen per cent of men said they would get beauty treatments ahead of a job interview to give them a last minute polish. One in ten also admitted to getting a beauty treatment like a tanning bed session before a date. Men from Birmingham were the most proud of their appearance, with the average male in the city spending £326 annually on beauty treatments, compared to the national average of £155, while Belfast boys were bottom of the list with a yearly spend of £95. And it seems that male celebrities are mainly to blame for this rise in beauty culture - when asked who their ultimate pin-up is, super-styled David Beckham topped the poll as having the most desirable look, with George Clooney and Brad Pitt coming in at second and third place. One in ten men admitted to having their underarms waxed while 33 per cent admitted to having massages . Andy Penniceard, owner and founder of Privet Body, a spa leader for male treatments, said: . 'The research from lastminute.com only highlights what we have been witnessing in the salon - an increasing trend for men taking more care of their health and appearance. 'There's definitely evidence to suggest that men are using beauty treatments as a way to spoil themselves. 'The majority of men coming for hair removal might be under 35, but you'd be surprised how many older chaps come in to be tidied up downstairs. 'Some of them just like the clean feel of a hairless body, some like the look, and a lot of them might be doing it because their partner prefers it!'","New survey revealed a third of blokes would describe themselves as vain .

"As one of the most glamorous stars of reality TV, Sam Faiers is well-known for her immaculate sense of style. And while you'll never catch her without a pair of false eyelashes on, it isn't for vanity's sake. In fact, the 23-year-old suffers with Trichotillomania - a disorder which causes her to pull out her real eyelashes. Left without any natural eyelashes, Sam was forced to wear falsies for years - and now she's using her experience to branch out into a new beauty venture. Scroll down for video . Expert advice: The range includes three styles of false eyelashes, including 'Oh! So Natural', which Sam has designed to complement daytime makeup . Glamorous: The second look - 'If Looks Could Kill'  - is her favourite style and has been designed to create more volume for an elegant seductive look . Speaking to MailOnline as she launches her debut false eyelash collection, Sam said: 'I suffer from Trichotillomania, which is a condition where I have the compulsion to pull out my eyelashes. I've been wearing false eyelashes since I was 16 so this seemed like a perfect avenue for me to go into. 'I've been to see lots of people to try to help me overcome this but it hasn't worked so I have to wear eyelashes as I don't have any real ones.' Sam, who wants to be known as 'Samantha', has created three signature looks for her Lashes by Samantha range that she says are perfect for every occasion. The first, 'Oh! So Natural', is a chic addition for your daytime makeup, she says. The second look -and her personal favourite - 'If Looks Could Kill', has been designed to create more volume for an 'elegant seductive look'. Bold: The final set of false lashes - 'Glam it Up', is for the super glamorous woman who wants to make a statement, she says, as she models the range herself . Channeling her expertise: Speaking about her new lashes, which range in price between £6-£6.25 a pair, she said: 'I've bought thousands of lashes over the years as I wear them everyday' The final, 'Glam it Up', is for the super glamorous woman who wants to make a statement, she says. 'I'm really proud of my range,' she explains. 'I really think they are the perfect lashes - everyone I have given them has been complimented whenever I wear them.' Sharing her top tips for applying falsies, the expert said: 'Trim the outside, not the inside of the lashes to suit your eyes size, put the glue on and wait a few seconds until it gets tacky and put them on with tweezers to ensure they are on securely.' Sam has been showcasing some seriously sophisticated style lately - and her appearance at The Hunger Games premiere this fortnight was case in point. Speaking about her red carpet experience, she said: 'Because I had such a special dress on from DVF, I wanted the focus to be on that. So I opted for a glossy, glamorous look with a little bit of bronzer and a glossy lip. I wore my Lashes By Samantha 'Glam it Up' look as it was such a big occasion. 'It was absolutely amazing. I love Jennifer Lawrence, she's the ultimate celebrity in my eyes. She's so honest and beautiful, you just know she's herself, which is something that I love. 'I'm obsessed with the Hunger Games franchise, I've read all the books and I was so excited that I saw the cast in the flesh for the first time.' Sam's idols: The reality star loves actresses Jennifer Lawrence, left, and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley . It isn't just Jennifer Lawrence that the reality TV star admires - she's been taking inspiration from Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, too. Speaking about her beauty icon, she said: 'She is really someone who I get inspiration from beautywise. She always looks so effortless but so glamorous at the same time. I use rosehip oil underneath my makeup as she swears by it.' Trichotillomania is an impulse-control disorder which causes people to pull out their hair, which could be from the hair on their head or hair on other parts of their body, which eventually leads to bald patches. It is a psychological condition and therefore people who suffer with it are not able to stop themselves from pulling out their hair as they feel an intense urge to do so as it causes a sense of relief. Her new lash line is only the latest addition to her burgeoning 'By Samantha' range, which also includes her award-winning fragrance, La Bella. 'I think that I'm growing up and really finding my feet in the fashion and beauty industry,' she said. 'I have my fitness project launching in January, which is really exciting. I can't wait for everyone to see it and experience it. I also have a new collection from my range with Very, which will be out in January. There will also be more products from the 'By Samantha' range.' It seems that The only way is up for Sam since leaving the Essex show behind.

"After a week of misery, the end is finally in sight for passengers aboard the nightmare Carnival cruise ship as the vessel makes the last leg of its journey in to port today. The ship's 3,143 passengers and 1,086 crew members have been stuck on the Carnival Cruise Lines’ 'Triumph' in the Gulf of Mexico since Sunday after a fire in the engine room crippled the power system. Passengers reported how the four day luxury cruise then turned into a nightmare as carpets became soaked in urine and scare food supplies left them with nothing to eat but cold sandwiches. Their horrendous journey will finally end today with the ship expected to arrive at Mobile in Alabama around 4pm.

The ship left Galveston, Texas, for a four-day cruise last Thursday and was about 150 . miles off Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula when an engine room fire knocked out its primary power source on Sunday. The blow-out crippled the ships water and plumbing . systems - leaving it adrift on only a backup power. 'Toilets are overflowing in the cabins, we are having to sleep in the hallways.

The . first tug boat reached the Carnival Triumph on Monday night and began . towing the vessel to Mobile, Alabama, at the rate of a few miles per . hour. Reports say that there are only five working bathrooms for the more than 3,000 passengers on board.

She . told the network that the staff have been helpful, but that is doing . little for the putrid conditions, including the unbearable heat and long . lines for food and bathrooms. Another passenger, Debra Rightmire, texted ABC: 'Conditions are getting worse by the hour. Cabin carpets are wet with urine and water.

The ship is listing to 4.5 degrees and although not dangerous, the angle of the boat is 'not normal and would definitely be felt by passengers walking around', an expert told MailOnline. A 25-mph south-southeasterly wind has made it too difficult to tow the ship to its original destination of Progreso, Mexico, so the vessel has changed course and is heading north to Alabama. Carnival Cruise Lines president and CEO, . Gerry Cahill, said: 'All guests on the . current Carnival Triumph voyage will receive a full refund for the . cruise, along with transportation expenses. 'In addition, they will receive a . future cruise credit equal to the amount paid for this voyage, as well . as reimbursement of all shipboard purchases during the voyage, with the . exception of gift shop and casino charges.

Carnival Cruise Lines has since canceled a dozen more planned voyages aboard the Triumph and acknowledged that the crippled ship had been plagued by other mechanical problems in the weeks before an engine-room fire left it powerless in the Gulf of Mexico. The ship is expected to finally dock in Alabama around 4pm today. Passengers' stay in Alabama will be limited, Carnival said in a statement late Wednesday. The company said passengers were being given the option of boarding buses directly to Galveston, Texas, or Houston, or spending the night in a hotel in New Orleans, where the company said it booked 1,500 rooms. Those staying in New Orleans will be flown Friday to Houston. Carnival said it will cover all the transportation costs.

"The husband of a teacher who spent the night with a 16-year-old pupil has told how she seduced the boy as revenge after he had an affair. Bernadette Smith, 35, narrowly avoided a prison sentence this week after confessing her infatuation with her student Gary Ralston. The court heard how she called the boy into her classroom at Banockburn High School in Stirling, and confessed her feelings for him. The pair later kissed passionately in a park, and spent the night in bed, where Smith wore just jeans and a bra. Abuse of trust: Sheriff Wyllie Robertson told Smith (left), 35, . who kissed Gary, then 16, (right) and lay beside him wearing only jeans and a . bra, that she had committed a serious abuse of trust. She was spared jail . Waived anonymity: Gary, now 17, in his bedroom where one of the incidents took place. He said his relationship with Smith, who was his teacher during third, fourth and fifth year, began during secret meetings  at school . Now Brian Smith, 35, has revealed how . his wife, with whom he has three children, told him she seduced the boy . as punishment for his affair in 2004. 'She said I deserved it, that this was payback. I’ve hit a brick wall trying to explain or understand it', he told the Daily Record. 'I . maybe could have understood if she had gone with another teacher, or a . neighbour, to get back at me. But not a boy, never. Not someone in her . care.' He told how his wife disappeared for a night with the boy, and sent him a text telling him their relationship had to end. She then switched off her phone, leaving him to desperately try and track her down. She came home the next day while he was getting their children ready for school and confessed the affair. His wife was later arrested and taken to court, where this week she admitted engaging in sexual activity with a pupil while in a position of trust. She was sentenced to two years of supervision at Stirling Sheriff Court, and will be on the sex offenders' register for the same period of time. Mr Smith, a bus driver, added that he does not blame Gary for what happened, as he was a 'victim' and only did what he was told. The affair started in Smith's classroom at Bannockburn High School, Stirling, where she confessed her feelings to the boy, before the pair went to a park and had their first kiss . The pupil, who waived his anonymity to speak of the relationship, said Smith had been his favourite teacher before she targeted him for particular attention. He . said: ‘I was thinking I was quite lucky. A lot of the boys fancied her. I couldn’t believe she was with me. It was the last thing I expected. She said she thought she was going crazy but couldn’t help the way she . was feeling.’ Placing the . mother of three under a supervision order yesterday, Sheriff Wyllie . Robertson told her she had committed a serious abuse of trust. He said it was only the fact that she had not gone further with the boy that had saved her from a jail sentence. Gary . revealed how his relationship with Smith, who was his teacher during . third, fourth and fifth year, began during secret meetings  at school. ‘When . I started year six, Bernadette was no longer my teacher, but we’d pass . each other in the corridor, say hello and smile,’ he said. He said that . Smith later summoned him to her classroom. ‘I . walked in and as soon as I sat down she said, “Ever since we’ve been . back at school and I’ve seen you around, I’ve been realising I have . feelings for you”,’ he said. Sexual misconduct: Bernadette Smith, left and right leaving court, drove the boy to a park and kissed him . Describing himself as ‘curious’ and ‘excited’, Gary agreed to meet the history and English teacher on September 13 last year. The pair drove to a park in Falkirk, Scotland, and went for a walk but when they got back to the car, Smith kissed him passionately. Gary said he worried for Smith’s job, husband and family but said she ‘didn’t seem too bothered’. He confided in his father, who warned him to be careful but his grandmother called Bannockburn High School to complain. Smith was suspended immediately. Despite their relationship being made public, they stayed together the next night at Gary’s home in Cowie. Gary said: ‘We got ready for bed and I felt nervous. I got into bed with my boxers on. She took off her top, but kept her bra and jeans on, and slid in beside me. ‘We cuddled and talked – nothing else happened.’ His father Richard Ralston, 42, said: ‘I wasn’t pleased about what happened, but you’re an adult at 16 in Scotland so I didn’t want to interfere too much. ‘I want Gary to make decisions and learn from any mistakes.’ Prosecutor Ann Orr told Stirling Sheriff Court that when interviewed, Smith said ‘she loved the boy and they both wanted to be together’. She admitted kissing Gary and staying the night in  his bedroom. There was no suggestion that Gary had suffered any long-term harm, the court was told. Smith, of Denny, Stirlingshire, pleaded guilty to engaging in sexual activity with a pupil while in a position of trust, between September 13 and 20 last year. Gary, now 17, revealed how his relationship with Smith, who was his teacher during his third, fourth and fifth years, blossomed during secret meetings at Bannockburn high school . She was placed under supervision for two years and will remain on the sex offenders’ register for the same period. Her solicitor, Andrew Gibb, said she was suspended by the General Teaching Council for Scotland and would be struck off at a hearing in a few weeks’ time. She has also separated from her husband. Sheriff Robertson told the court Smith’s conduct was towards the lesser end of the offending scale, adding: ‘It is serious enough of course when a teacher admits this kind of conduct towards a pupil. 'We expect teachers to ensure children under their care are safe from abuse and that has not happened.’ He told Smith that it may have been that ‘difficulties within your marriage contributed to this aberration’, but he said many other teachers coped without resorting to such ‘bizarre’ behaviour. He said it was to her ‘credit’ that she had not blamed her victim and she was assessed as at low risk of re-offending.  He ordered her to return to court on November 12 for a supervision order review.","Teacher Bernadette Smith kissed and shared a bed with Gary Ralston .

"A mother whose 12-year-old girl is stranded on the crippled Carnival cruise ship has seen the girl for the first time in a week as she waved from the top deck of the stricken vessel. The emotional reunion came as Rebekah Poret waved frantically at CNN helicopters hovering over the ship as her mother Mary watched a television screen and spoke with the girl over the phone. 'I love you,' Rebekah told her mother. 'I . can't wait to see you. I can't wait to be back home.' 'I love you too. I . promise I'm going to have a nice snuggly blanket for you when I see . you,' Mary said, telling her daughter they could go to McDonalds. 'Anything you want to eat tonight is yours.' Mrs Poret is . waiting in Mobile, Alabama, where the Carnival Triumph . is expected to dock by 11 p.m. after five days . stranded at sea. Her daughter said she cannot wait to be back on dry land. Missed: Rebekah Poret is pictured with her mother, Mary, who is waiting for her in Mobile, Alabama . 'It feels a lot better because . I know that we're one step closer to being back home,' Rebekah said, . adding: 'But we're still so far away. I can't wait to get back.' Rebekah spoke to CNN to reveal her daily hell dealing with . 'horrible smells', cold temperatures and not knowing when she's going to . get her next meal. She is on the ship with her father, Larry, her 10-year-old friend Allie Taylor and Allie's father Carmel. 'When . I wake up in the morning, I ask my dad, ""Can I go back to sleep again?"" because I want another day to pass so bad,' Rebekah told CNN as she . tried to stay warm. She said one of the biggest struggles is getting food - and not knowing if there will be any warm food by the time they reach the front of the line. Allie said they have been eating cold sandwiches. First sighting: Rebekah Poret, 12, waves from the top of the Carnival cruise ship as her mother watches coverage by CNN - allowing her to see her daughter for the first time in a week . Struggle: Rebekah, in yellow, told CNN that she was suffering through cold temperatures and little food . Rebekah added that a smell from the . bathrooms is also insufferable, and lingers on every deck of the ship, . which is carrying more than 5,000 people, including passengers and . staff. Distressed . passengers have previously spoken of sewage sloshing around in hallways . and dripping down the walls, flooded rooms and an unbearable stench. 'The bathroom situation is horrible,' Rebekah said. 'Some toilets are working and some of them are not working. On some parts of the ship it smells . horrible but right here on deck five it doesn't smell too bad but you . still know it's there.' Her father Larry Poret added: 'We were asked to use plastic bags to go to the bathroom and then used the shower. Sewage is going from one floor to the next... Passengers are wading in it.' Allie also said the conditions are unbearable, and admitted she 'had to do my business in a can'. The cold is also getting her down - especially as she admitted to CNN that she forgot to bring a jacket on board as she assumed the climate would be tropical. She said there is no heat inside the vessel. Staying strong: The young girl said is has been hard not knowing when they will get their next meal . Heading home: She will be reunited with her mother, right, when the vessel docks in Alabama tonight . Thankfully her friend Ally gave her a . spare and many people are wearing bathrobes to ward of temperatures . reaching 46 degrees Fahrenheit outside the ship. 'They're trying to make the best of it . but you can see how much they really dislike the situation,' she said. 'And how . could you like the situation? You really can't.' Even though the ship is slowly being tugged to the shoreline, she said she feels as if they are making no progress. 'I know we're moving a little bit but I really don't feel anything,' she said. Mary Poret, who is waiting for her daughter and ex-husband in Mobile along with Allie's mother, previously told CNN that she had had sporadic contact with Rebekah. Stranded: Ten-year-old Allie Taylor is also stuck on the Carnival Triumph with her father and the Porets . Apart: Her mother, Kimberly McKerreghan, left, is also waiting in Mobile for her daughter's return . The Carnival Triumph is expected to dock tonight in Mobile, Alabama between 8pm and 11pm (ET). Custom and borders patrol agents are currently sailing out to meet the ship to speed up the process when the boat finally docks. Carnival said that 200 staff members, including a 'care team', will be highly visible at the port to help their exhausted and grubby passengers. Medical teams will also be on hand for anyone who needs health care. They will first set foot in a terminal which has been disused for more than a year. Despite landing in Mobile, a city which has hundreds of hotel rooms and two airports, passengers will then either board buses directly to Galveston or Houston in Texas. The other option is to spend the night in a New Orleans hotel room. Those who opt to stay in New Orleans will catch flights to Houston on Friday. Guests have already indicated which option they prefer to Carnival. Carnival VP Terry Thornton said today that it as not 'logistically feasible' for passengers to remain in Mobile because of the volume of flights required. Carnival said it will cover all transportation costs. 'She was hysterical, crying hysterically,' Mrs Poret said. 'She was scared. She don't know what was going to happen next. 'And what broke my heart the very most was her saying, ""Mommy, I don't . know if I'll ever see you again,"" and that's really hard to hear from . your 12-year-old daughter.' The Carnival Triumph is expected to finally reach dry land on Thursday between 8pm-11pm (ET). The ship is now in view from shore - . but those on board are being forced to wait up to ten hours before they . land in Mobile as the powerless ship battles high winds and strong . currents. The boat is crawling along at the rate of six to seven knots, about the pace of a lawnmower. It . is a further frustration for the 3,143 passengers and 1,086 crew . members who have endured four days stranded at sea in the Gulf of Mexico . after a fire in the engine room crippled the power system. On . the top deck, a 'shanty town' has sprung up with passengers sleeping on . sun loungers, wrapped in bedsheets to stay warm as temperatures dropped . to 46F. Despite the fact . it rained all night, passengers opted to sleep outdoors because the . stench of sewage has become so unbearable on board. Medical teams are stationed at the docks to help any passengers who might need emergency healthcare. Doctor Jorge Rodriguez said the Trumph was a 'floating petri dish' because of the combination of circumstances on board. He . told CNN: 'So far there hasn't been an outbreak of anything, but ... it's in the Gulf. It's warm. You don't have sanitary conditions, so . hopefully they'll get back to shore ... before anything breaks out.' Long journey: The ship has been stranded  for an extra four days after an engine fire broke out on Sunday . Plea: The Edmond family stuck on Carnival hold a sign after days of poor food and no showers . Carnival said in a statement late on Wednesday that passengers would be helped through customs by 200 staff members at the scene. They were also being given the option of boarding buses directly to Galveston, Texas, or Houston, or spending the night in a hotel in New Orleans, where the company said it booked 1,500 rooms. Those staying in New Orleans will be flown on Friday to Houston. Carnival said it will cover all the transportation costs.","Rebekah Poret waved at CNN helicopter as mother watched on TV .

"A pilot cheated death on live TV when his helicopter crashed as he was putting up a seven-storey Christmas tree. Television viewers in New Zealand watched in horror as the blades of Greg Gribble's helicopter became tangled in cables attached to scaffolding on Auckland's waterfront. Dramatic footage shows the rear of the helicopter snapping, flinging Mr Gribble out of the front door of the helicopter, then slamming him back through its side door. The aircraft then dropped 25ft to the ground. Scroll down to see video... Crash: The helicopter pilot was lucky to walk away alive from the dramatic incident . Horror: The helicopter pilot had been helping install a seven-storey Christmas tree in Auckland, New Zealand . Helping hand: The helicopter pilot is escorted away from the crash site . Thousands watched the drama unfold on TV in New Zealand. Steve Hall witnessed the 10.30am crash from a boat moored nearby, and said the helicopter appeared to be trying to lift a tower near the drawbridge. He said its blades clipped the connecting wire as it hovered below the tip of the tower, sending it into a spin before it crashed into the ground. The Christmas tree, an Auckland institution, was being put up near the Te Wero Island bridge, which connects the Viaduct and Wynyard Quarter. The accident has left air-safety . campaigners aghast, as many have wondered why a helicopter was allowed . to perform such an intricate operation in such a built-up area. Telecom, its sponsors, wrote on . Twitter: 'Can confirm the helicopter that crashed was putting up our . Xmas tree. We're really happy to confirm pilot and ground crew all OK.' Gribble, . a pilot with 20 years' experience, in his mid-50s, and reportedly head of commercial . helicopter company Helisika, was taken to Auckland City Hospital with . minor to moderate injuries. Wiped out: The helicopter, piloted by Greg Gribble, crashed as it was helping install a seven-storey Christmas tree in Auckland's Viaduct Basin in New Zealand . Crash site: The helicopter will remain near the Te Wero Island bridge until tomorrow . Wreckage: The pilot miraculously escaped alive from the horrific crash . His . son Jaz told stuff.co.nz: 'I spoke to him not long after and it sounded . like he was okay. But he was obviously quite shaken as you can . imagine. 'Someone must have been looking out . for him. That's all we could have prayed for - that he's safe and happy. Someone must have been on his side.' His daughter Jade Gribble, who is nine . months pregnant with her first baby, added: 'I'd say he's very, very . lucky to walk away.' One witness, who gave his name as Richard, told APNZ the helicopter appeared to be about 5m from the ground when something snapped and it plunged. He said: 'The scary thing was actually seeing everyone on the ground running for their lives. People started running away and then they started running back (to help the pilot). 'They wrenched the helicopter door open and helped him from the wreckage. It was a surreal feeling to be out of danger but watching it unfold before my eyes. 'The nice thing is I wasn't looking at someone's leg being chopped off.' Jason Aarsen, who was sitting down for a break at the waterfront, added: 'I hear a massive whack of two power cables hitting each other and as I turned around, I just saw the helicopter drop, completely freefall. 'The blades blew out and completely freefalled down, snapped in half. It propped itself up and sat like a fish out of water. It was really gnarly. The pilot was sitting there, speaking.' An investigation has now been launched by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), with lead investigator Steve Walker already on the scene. CAA spokesman Emma Peel told NZ Newswire the fact the crash was filmed would be of 'considerable assistance' to understanding what happened. She said: 'The footage will likely become a big part of the investigation. It's one of those rare but very useful things that does happen from time to time.' Gribble and a host of witnesses are now being interviewed, she said. And she added: 'From there we'll piece together a picture of what happened.' The helicopter is expected to remain where it crashed on the busy Viaduct wharf, not far from waterfront restaurants, until tomorrow. The CAA expects to publish a preliminary report within four weeks.","Pilot Greg Gribble had 20 years of experience .

"A young girl has told a court how her sex attacker branded her with his initial. The child was just 11 when Mohammed Karrar, 38, allegedly bought her and loaned her to abusers all around the country for £600 a year. She told a court yesterday about being mutilated by a hairpin, saying: 'After heating it up for a little while, he stuck it on my bum. 'It was M for Mo and he said I belonged to him. He was branding me so people knew I was his.' In the dock: Kamar Jamil, Akhtar Dogar, Anjum Dogar, Assad . Hussain, Mohammed Karrar, Bassam Karrar, Mohammed Hussain, Zeeshan Ahmed . and Bilal Ahmed are accused of abusing vulnerable girls as young as 11 . over the course of eight years in Oxford. They all deny the charges . Over five years the girl, now 19, was repeatedly raped by large groups of men in what she described as ‘torture sex’, the jury was told last month. Seven . men of Pakistani origin and two from North Africa are accused of 79 . offences against six vulnerable white British girls. The charges include . child rape, sexual trafficking and child prostitution. Noel Lucas QC, prosecuting, said . Karrar – known as Egyptian Mo – bought the youngest victim from an . unnamed man just after her 11th birthday. He befriended her with gifts of perfume and hard drugs but then began to beat her up and raped her, the Old Bailey was told. He branded her with one of her hair . pins, which he had twisted into the shape of an ‘M’ and heated with a . cigarette lighter. It left a scar on her left buttock. ‘He regarded her as his property,’ Mr Lucas said. ‘He showed her no regard. If she had the temerity to resist, he beat her. ‘He branded her to make her his . property and to ensure others knew about it.’ At the age of 12 she was . introduced to Karrar’s brother Bassam, 33, who is also accused of raping . her. The girl ‘describes the Karrars as . sick sex monsters’, Mr Lucas said. ‘They were always talking about sex . and spoke about women in a vile manner. ‘Mohammed Karrar liked her to dress up and act out role play. Both brothers used to beat her.’ From the age of 12 the girl was sold . to groups of Asian men who violently raped her in private homes and . guesthouses around Oxford and elsewhere. Sometimes she was injected with . heroin or given date drugs to ensure she complied with the gang’s sick . demands, it was alleged. Mr Lucas added: ‘It became routine for . her to be taken to various locations, houses and hotels by the Karrar . brothers so she could treat their guests. She would be made to dress up, . wear very short skirts and a bikini top, do her hair and put on lots of . make-up. The jury of seven men and five women at the Old Bailey were told that the men targeted care homes and schools to find their victims . By the end of the evening she would . have been sexually used and abused by all the men. She would be so . drugged up as to be unable to feel the pain.’ Just after her 12th birthday the girl . told Karrar she was carrying his child. He allegedly beat her up and . then took her to a house in Reading where she was given a ‘backroom . abortion’ using a crochet hook. On other occasions Karrar raped the girl in the living room of her own home as her father slept in another room, it was said. Sometimes his friends would arrive at . her house and they would allegedly rape her too. The girl, who came from . a troubled family, naively believed ‘Mo’ loved her and was going to . marry her when she was 16, the court heard. During a trip to the Lake District in 2007, when she was 14, she is said to have been called by Karrar on her mobile phone. David Hughes, a social worker, answered and Karrar allegedly asked to speak to her. When Mr Hughes refused, Karrar . allegedly said: ‘If you don’t get her I’ll **** you up, I’ll **** her up . and I’ll **** her mum.’ Later the girl told the social worker of  ‘men . who took her to houses’. In January 2008, she told police a man . called ‘Egyptian Mo’ had raped her in London nine months previously. Two years later the girl contacted her alleged attacker for an apology . but was raped again, the court heard. Kamar Jamil, 27, Akhtar Dogar, 32, his . brother Anjum Dogar, 30, Assad Hussain, 32, Mohammed Karrar, Bassam . Karrar, Mohammed Hussain, 24, Zeeshan Ahmed, 27, and Bilal Ahmed, 26, . deny all the charges against them. The trial continues.

"A Boston bombing victim who suffered serious burns to his arms and legs has proposed to a nurse he met during his recovery. James Costello, 31, from Malden, Massachusetts, popped the question to Krista D'Agostino while on a 10-day trip to Europe for bombing survivors - and she said yes. The heartwarming news comes eight months after Costello headed to the marathon finish line with five childhood friends. The bombs exploded nearby, killing three and injuring more than 270. Costello was famously pictured looking dazed walking through the debris-strewn streets with his clothes torn to shreds by the blasts. Happiness: Boston bombing victim 31-year-old James Costello, left, has proposed to Krista D'Agostino, a nurse he met at a rehabilitation center as he overcame his injuries following the April tragedy . Joy: D'Agostino reveals her engagement ring in Lyon, France, where Costello popped the question . His right arm and right leg suffered such serious burns that he needed pig skin grafts. 'April 15 was one of the worst days of . my life,' Costello, known as 'Bim' to his friends, wrote in a Facebook post. 'I soon . wondered why and for what reason this had happened.' But from the pain he found joy. After undergoing multiple surgeries at Massachusetts General Hospital, he was moved to Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital - where he first saw Krista D'Agostino. 'A few days later I saw a nurse in . passing, this would turn out to be Krista, who had shared a few mutual . friends, but we had never crossed paths before,' he wrote. Pain: Costello is pictured in the streets moments after the blasts at the Boston Marathon finish line . 'After . sharing a handful of conversations I realized not only how beautiful she . was but also what a kind heart she had.

Massachusetts town of Stoneham, grew up at each others' houses. As for Costello, he worked through rehabilitation, undergoing daily physical therapy to strengthen his weakened leg muscles. Metal shavings of bomb debris continue to work their way out of skin on his right arm.","James 'Bim' Costello was at the Boston Marathon finish line with childhood friends when they were all injured in the blasts .

"A dramatic home video has emerged of the moment when a Mexican drug lord was shot and killed by an assassin dressed as a clown. Francisco Rafael Arellano Felix was shot dead at a family birthday party on October 18 and a new video shows that the revelers had no idea what was going on. The minute-long video shows a rather docile crowd sitting inside a party venue while a band and singer belts out a traditional song. The shooter: The assassin dressed as a clown walks right past someone filming the singer at the party . Moments before: The singer was belting out a traditional song and the crowd looked calm . Halfway through, a clown wearing a bright blue costume and hot pink curly wig walks in front of the camera. Moments later, the camera becomes obstructed and four successive gunshots are heard. People are then heard screaming and running. The video was obtained by the local Tijiuana paper Semanario Zeta which reports that the assassination is still being investigated. Killed: Francisco Rafael Arellano Felix has been shot dead at a beach house . There were reports that the 'clown' was accompanied by two other people but it is not clear who they are or whether or not they were also wearing costumes. The Felix family is a prominent one in the drug trade as the assassination target was the oldest brother of the leader of the Tijiuana Cartel. Felix, 63, spent nearly 15 years behind bars for drug-related offenses after his arrest in Mexico in 1993. American authorities found enough evidence to bring charges and Arellano Felix was extradited to the U.S. in 2006 to face California charges stemming from a 1980 case in which he allegedly sold cocaine to an undercover police officer. After being granted parole and released, he returned to Mexico in 2008. Led by a large family of brothers and sisters, the Tijuana Cartel was one of the most powerful drug gangs in Mexico until it was gradually weakened by the capture or killing of several leading members. Arellano Felix's younger brothers, Francisco Javier, Benjamin and Eduardo are serving prison sentences in the U.S. Another of his brothers, Ramon, was killed in a shootout with police in 2002.","Francisco Rafael Arellano .

"The full story behind the 'shoplifting' grandfather body slammed to the ground emerged today, as the nation searched its soul following the chaotic, sometimes violent, scenes of greed on Black Friday. Jerald Allen Newman, 54, has come to symbolise the mayhem of the day after he was videoed with blood streaming down his face as he was arrested by police officers in Phoenix, Arizona. The police say he was shoplifting and sustained the injuries because he resisted arrest and became aggressive after being found with a video game down his pants. But Mr Newman's tearful eight-year-old grandson, Nick, . has spoken out to defend his grandfather to ABC News, saying: 'I only got one game and . people were trying to take it away from me and put it under his shirt so . no one would take it' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Out cold: Jerald Allen Newman was knocked unconscious after a police officer kicked his leg out from under him while arresting him. Blood began pooling on the floor as officers handcuffed him . 'Brutality': In the video, customers shout at the police and accuse them of using unnecessary force while arresting Mr Newman . Mr Newman's family insist that he was trying . to protect young Nick from a mob of marauding bargain . hunters who were trampling him during an uncontrollable stampede at a . video game display in Wal-Mart. The ordeal terrified Nick, who sobbed as he talked about it nearly two days later. 'Never go there on Black Friday, because if you go, you will get hurt,' the boy said about his local Wal-Mart. It . was just one of many chaotic scenes that saw near-riots break out, one . shopper shot and a woman pepper spray 20 others at a Wal-Mart in . California. Women fought over yoga pants in Pennsylvania and police used pepper spray to disperse a crowd in North Carolina. The . graphic video of Mr Newman's arrest is the most poignant image to emerge . from the violence that broke out across the country as hysterical mobs . of shoppers flooded stores late Thursday and early Friday looking for . deep discounts on Christmas gifts. Frenzy: Witnesses say Mr Newman was just trying to save his grandson, who has been knocked to the ground during a stampede at a video game display . Terrified: Mr Newman's eight-year-old grandson Nick said his grandfather was only trying to protect him from the mob of shoppers . The woman who allegedly blasted rival . shoppers with pepper spray at a Los Angles Wal-Mart has turned herself . into police, authorities said. She could face battery charges but is not currently in police custody. Her identity was not released. In . Arizona, police countered witnesses statements about Mr Newman's arrest and say he resisted officers and began to flail while being handcuffed. 'He's responsible,' said Larry Hall, the Assistant Police Chief in Buckeye, Arizona. The video, posted on YouTube, shows Mr . Newman unconscious and covered in blood after a police officer forced . him to the ground Thursday night. Officers . in the video try to sop up blood as outraged customers yell expletives . and say 'that's police brutality' and 'he wasn't doing anything.' 'Are you sure that was necessary for shoplifting?' said one shopper. 'Why would you throw him down so hard?' Cleanup: Police officers tried to sop up the blood that pooled on the floor after Mr Newman was dropped to the ground . Mr Newman suffered a bloody nose and gash on his head requiring four stitches. Witnesses . described pandemonium at the Walmart video game display. Out-of-control . customers ripped apart the display box holding the games. One woman was punched . during the melee, according to reports. Mr Newman's grandson got caught up in the crowd and was knocked to the ground, cutting his lip. Witnesses say Mr Newman stuck the game in his waistband under his shirt to help free his hands so he could protect the boy. A Wal-Mart security guard saw Mr Newman and brought him over to local police officers. 'They grabbed the guy, body planted him . into the ground -- face shatters on concrete. That's a hard concrete . floor inside Wal-Mart,' Skylar Stone, who said he witnessed the entire . exchange, told Fox 10 in Phoenix. 'All of a sudden, you see this little boy run up and wailing and yelling, ""Grandpa, Grandpa,"" and crying his eyes out.' More chaos: Arizona wasn't the only state with Black Friday frenzy. Here, a mob rushes an Urban Outfitters in California . The police report describes a chaotic scene in the Walmart, where customers were made to wait until 10pm Thanksgiving Day. About 200 people surrounded the stand and inched closer and closer despite officers warning them to stay back. 'I observed the crowd rush in and attack the cardboard displays with . video games flying through the air and the cardboard displays being . thrown around and broken completely down flat on the ground,' one . officer wrote in the report. Another officer described seeing a man get trampled and helping him . to safety, while another officer saw a woman walking away from the stand . with a young girl who was crying and holding her mouth in pain. One customer reported that people yanked three video games from him, leaving him empty-handed. Combat: Up to 20 people in a California Walmart were hit with pepper spray after a woman unleashed the noxious chemical to ward off other shoppers vying for XBoxes . The Arizona Wal-Mart wasn't the only store where chaos reigned. A Los Angeles shopper used pepper-spray on 20 fellow bargain hunters in a battle to reach a cart of heavily-discounted XBox consoles at a Wal-Mart. A shopper was shot and critically wounded in a robbery at a Wal-Mart in San Leandro, California. In Fayetteville, North Carolina, gunfire at 2 a.m. on Black Friday morning sent shoppers diving for cover at a shopping mall. Police were also investigating a possible shooting in the car park of Valley West Mall in West Des Moines, Iowa. Force: Gordon Jackson was arrested at a Walmart in Kingston, North Carolina, after he complained about police using pepper spray on a crowd . A Phoenix, Arizona, Wal-Mart had to be evacuated Thanksgiving day for a bomb scare after an employee found a suspicious package that police said appeared to be an explosive. At an Urban Outfitters at Thousand Oaks Mall outside Los Angeles, a frenzied mob trampled theft protection systems as they flooded into the store. An off-duty police officer working as a security guard at a Walmart in Kingston, North Carolina, used pepper spray on a crowd of 30 to 40 shoppers. He then arrested a man who protested the use of force. Women and girls outside Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, reportedly erupted into a very un-zen-like brawl over yoga pants that were on sale at Victoria's Secret. Bloody Friday: Police are still searching for the robbers who shot a man outside a Walmart in San Leandro, California, after a robbery about 1.50am . Retailers estimate 152 million shoppers spilled into stores for Black Friday. Assistant Chief Hall defended his officer's against against Mr Newman, who he said was resisting arrest and the officer acted within reason. Assistant Chief Hall did not release the name of the officer, who was hired by Walmart to work at the store while he was off duty. He was one of five law enforcement officers hired by the store to deal with Thursday night crowds. Assistant Chief Hall said a Walmart employee alerted the officer involved that Newman had put a video game in his waistband, and that the officer approached Newman and started to arrest him. When he had handcuffs on one of Newman's wrists, Assistant Chief Hall said Mr Newman told the officer, 'I'm not going to jail,' and started pulling away and flailing. Not so Zen: Shopper Liz Wentling told CBS girls and mothers in Monroeville, Pennsylvania, were punching each other at a Victoria's Secret store where a great deal on yoga clothing was causing a stir . The police spokesman said Mr Newman continued resisting and the officer decided to sweep Mr Newman's legs out from underneath him and drop him to the ground. 'Unfortunately, the suspect landed on his head,' Assistant Chief Hall said. The officer involved wrote in the police report that he yelled at Newman to 'stop resisting!' before deciding to force him to the ground. 'The store was incredibly crowded, and I was concerned about other customers' safety and possibly getting involved,' he wrote. 'I then utilized a leg sweep with my right leg as I pulled down with my arms to take Jerald to the ground to better affect the arrest and protect the other shoppers.' Big deals: Retailers estimate 152 million people went out Friday to buy Christmas gifts . The report said that Newman's grandson was treated and released for his injuries by firefighters at the scene. Hall said an administrative review will be conducted to assess the officer's use of force, but it appeared to be justified. 'The officer didn't lift the guy over his head and slam him to the ground,' he said. 'He used a minimum amount of force, the suspect resisted arrest, and the officer actually could have escalated his use of force. But he didn't. He used his hands to take the suspect into custody.' An ambulance took Newman to the hospital, where he got four stitches for a cut on the left side of his forehead. His nose was also bloodied but not broken, Assistant Chief Hall said. Mr Newman was then booked into the Maricopa County jail on suspicion of shoplifting and resisting arrest. Police found Newman's 8- or 9-year-old grandson crying after the incident and turned him over to his grandmother, who police described as hysterical. 'The wife was so upset and told me Jerald was just trying to protect his grandson that got trampled in the crowd and just placed a video game under his shirt while grabbing his grandson to get out of the crowd,' wrote one officer.

"Facebook: As with most sites, legitimate warnings from the site will come when you attempt to log in, not in unsolicited emails, no matter how convincing they look . 'Phishing' scams range from the hilariously inept up to sophisticated attacks that can fool even computer experts. But a new email Facebook scam is among the cleverer attacks directed at users of the social network - now a commercial hub used to trade music, video and films. A recent assault designed to steal users' Facebook details is among the most sophisticated yet, say experts - because it mimics the security procedures that sites such as Facebook or Google use to defend against 'internet trolls' and other 'bad behaviour' online. The scam comes in the form of an email accusing the user of a violation for insulting or annoying another Facebook users - and saying that their account will be deleted in 24 hours. Naturally, at this point, the email requires Facebook login details and - for 'authentication' purposes - parts of a person's credit card details. The email links to a fake Account Disabled page, which asks for a large number of personal details, including crediti card details. As site Hoax-Slayer, which found the email, points out, the access to login details enasbles the scam to travel further and faster, by sending it to new users from trusted friends. 'The emails are entirely bogus,' says internet security experts Sophos. 'They are not coming from Facebook. Social media venues would not request financial information, nor would they request login details. 'Once a criminal has gained access to a victim’s account, they will likely lock out the original account holder by changing account passwords and email addresses.

"It's certainly one way to race ahead in the festive ratings battle. The BBC has revealed that it will screen its controversial Top Gear special over Christmas – despite receiving a fresh complaint from Argentina’s ambassador. The episode sparked fury when it was filmed in the South American country earlier this year, with locals taking offence at the H982 FKL number plate on a Porsche driven by Jeremy Clarkson, believing it was a reference to the 1982 Falklands conflict. James May, Jeremy Clarkson and Richard Hammond will feature in this year's Christmas special of Top Gear . To be broadcast: In a show of defiance that risks escalating the row even further, the corporation last night insisted the provocative episode of Top Gear will sit at the heart of its festive programming . Clarkson, 54, denied the plate was chosen deliberately and claimed that he and his fellow presenters were forced to hide under their beds and flee Argentina after an angry mob searched their hotel and tried to attack them. But in a show of defiance that risks escalating the row even further, the corporation last night insisted the provocative episode will sit at the heart of its festive programming – alongside more traditional staples such as Doctor Who, Strictly Come Dancing and the last ever episodes of Miranda. There will also be a string of one-off dramas, including an adaptation of Roald Dahl’s classic Esio Trot starring Dustin Hoffman and Judi Dench. But it is the Top Gear special that will undoubtedly generate the most discussion. It shows Clarkson and his fellow presenters Richard Hammond and James May driving three V8 sports cars 1,600 miles through Patagonia in southern Argentina. Presenting trio: The Top Gear special shows Clarkson (centre) and his fellow presenters Hammond (left) and May (right) driving three V8 sports cars 1,600 miles through Patagonia in southern Argentina . The announcement of the Christmas line-up came on the same day that Argentina’s ambassador to the UK, Alicia Castro, wrote to the BBC Trust expressing ‘discontent’ with how the number plate fiasco was handled. Argentina’s ambassador to the UK, Alicia Castro has written to the BBC Trust expressing ‘discontent’ with how the number plate fiasco was handled . She claimed Clarkson’s behaviour ‘fell well below BBC’s editorial values and standards’ and called for a fresh investigation. And last night, Top Gear risked fresh controversy after a yellow Ford Raptor pick-up truck apparently driven by Clarkson was spotted in Canada without registration plates on the front or rear. But a BBC spokesman insisted the team had complied with local law, saying: ‘As a brand new vehicle, the car was being driven with a temporary operating permit which was displayed in the window.’ The programme has been embroiled in a string of controversies over the years, including accusations of racism after Clarkson apparently mumbled the word n***** during an outtake and referred to an Asian man as a ‘slope’ during a Burma special. In 2011, Hammond prompted a complaint by the Mexican ambassador after he suggested a Mexican car would be ‘lazy, feckless, flatulent, overweight’. In an interview with the Radio Times yesterday, the 44-year-old refused to say whether the BBC have since warned the Top Gear team to be more careful. But he said: ‘In society as a whole, we love to be offended and have a scapegoat. ‘But at Top Gear we’re the first to put our hands up and say we pitched it wrong. We have apologised. ‘We’re not in the business of genuinely upsetting or offending anyone. We’re in the business of entertainment, and if it fails to entertain, it’s wrong. If the public says we stepped over the line, then we have.'","Episode sparked fury when filmed in South America earlier this year .

British nurse Florence Nightingale came second and former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was third. Suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst and Mother Teresa completed the top five. Scroll down for video .

The most admired quality of women in the list, which was compiled after a poll of 2,000 British adults by Sky Arts, was that they were not afraid to challenge the beliefs of their time. But two thirds of those polled said young women today lack inspirational figures and eight in ten felt youngsters idolise modern celebrities too much. The poll was conducted to coincide with the launch of the second series of Sky Arts' Psychobitches, a sketch show with an all-star cast which will see women including The Mitford sisters and Florence Nightingale examined on the psychologist's couch.

"A Muslim mother has been told to expect a 'substantial' prison sentence after encouraging terrorism in Syria over social media. Runa Khan, 34, admitted posting a message on Facebook in September, saying: 'Sisters, if you love your sons, husbands and brothers, prove it by sending them to fight for Allah.'

Runa Khan, 34 (right), a mother-of-six, has been told to expect a 'substantial' jail sentence after pleading guilty to posting messages on Facebook encouraging men to go and fight 'for Allah' in Syria . On September 13, she sent a series of messages on the social media site describing a path into Syria and the name of a group in the country to join. Wearing a niqab while standing in the dock of Kingston Crown Court, Khan pleaded guilty to four counts of disseminating terrorist publications between July and September 2013. Addressing the defendant, Judge Peter Birts QC said: 'I’m sure you have been advised they are charges of the utmost gravitas that almost inevitably will be met by a substantial custodial sentence.' Judge Birts allowed Khan to wear a niqab in the dock after her barrister Jo Sidhu QC confirmed her identity. The court heard Khan, from Luton, sent a series of Facebook messages to an undercover police officer describing a route from Turkey into Syria. Kingston Crown Court, Surrey, heard that Khan posted the messages between July and September last year along with a picture of a suicide vest. She also posted details of a route into Syria from Turkey . She received details of the route from Mohammed Nahin Ahmed who has admitted spending eight months in Syria fighting alongside an Al Qaeda-linked terrorist group, the hearing was told. Ahmed and childhood friend Yusuf Zubair Sarwar, both 22, from Birmingham, fled to the country last May after contacting Islamic extremists. They each pleaded guilty to one count of engaging in preparation of terrorism acts at London’s Woolwich Crown Court earlier this month.","Runa Khan, 34, admitted posting messages with picture of a suicide vest .

"Sex and the City star Kim Cattrall has become embroiled in a row with the mayor of Liverpool over plans to sell off a piece of land to make way for a housing development. Liverpool-born Cattrall, 58, who played Samantha Jones in the hit TV series, voiced her support for the Save Sefton Park Meadows campaign as she visited her home city to pick up a magazine award. She described the park, which is situated in the Mossley Hill area of the city, as a 'refuge' during her childhood years and said proposals to turn it into a housing development were 'very sad'. Kim Cattrall, 58, who played Samantha Jones in hit TV series Sex and the City, was criticised by the mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, for voicing her support for the Save Sefton Park Meadows campaign (pictured) Liverpool mayor, Labour councillor Joe Anderson (pictured), said Cattrall's comments were 'ill-informed' However, Liverpool mayor, Labour councillor Joe Anderson, blasted her comments as 'ill-informed' and 'out of context' and questioned: 'What does she really know of the issues that Liverpool faces?.' The row started earlier this week when Cattrall, who is now predominantly based in New York, expressed her disappointed over the plans to build on the 11 acres of land. She told the Liverpool Echo: 'I love Sefton Park. I was lucky enough to grow up playing there. 'Sefton Park was a refuge for my mother during her childhood years, it was Dickensian really because her father disappeared and she didn't have much so Sefton Park represented every holiday that she ever had. 'So it's very sad what's going on right now with the meadows, and I feel that my involvement with that, it feels from my mum as well. I first told her about it and she said ""that's just not right, this is the people's land"" and I believe that as well.' Visiting the park on Saturday, she added: 'It's so pastoral, it's so beautiful and it gives people a place to contemplate and play and walk and we need that barrier between the houses and the park.' However, Mr Anderson hit out at her comments, saying 'it's all very well for a Hollywood superstar to shout from the sidelines'. He said: 'She may have played in Sefton Park when she briefly lived in the city as a girl, but she left. 'I am still here and having to deal with massive and savage Tory government cuts to our budget while devising ways to grow and sustain the city and protect its most vulnerable citizens. Cattrall expressed her desire for the 11 acre piece of land to remain untouched during her current visit to her home city. Although based in New York, she returned to collect an award at the city's Titanic Hotel (pictured) Cattrall appears to have had the last word after taking to her Twitter page to condemn the mayor's retaliation .

"Eating a diet high in fat could  stave off Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease and other signs of ageing, new research claims. High-fat diets postponed signs of ageing including impaired hearing and weight loss, and also stopped ageing of the brain, a study found. Scientists discovered medium chain fatty acids, like coconut oil, were particularly effective. They believe the fats help slow down the ageing process, by helping to repair cells and DNA damaged as a result. Scroll down for video . Fats such as coconut oils give the brain enough fuel to repair the damage to cells and DNA that causes ageing. Eating a high fat diet postponed signs of ageing including impaired hearing and weight loss . As part of the new study, researchers analysed mice with a defective DNA repair system. In humans, this defect causes the disorder Cockayne syndrome, where patients prematurely age as children and have a life-expectancy of between 10 and 12 years. Researchers found placing a mouse with this defect on a high-fat diet postponed ageing processes such as impaired hearing and weight loss. It also postponed the ageing of the brain, giving hope to children who age prematurely and patients suffering Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. The study's lead author Professor Vilhelm Bohr, of the University of Copenhagen, said: 'The study is good news for children with Cockayne syndrome, because we do not currently have an effective treatment. Cockayne syndrome (CS) is very rare disease resulting in slow growth in babies or  rapid aging in children. Persons with this syndrome have smaller than normal head sizes, are of short stature, their eyes appear sunken, and they have an 'aged' look. It is estimated to affect one in 500,000 children but difficult to diagnose. For CS patients who are affected at birth, life expectancy is three to seven years. Other patients only start to show symptoms in early childhood and their life expectancy tends to be under 20 years. However, some rare CS patients live significantly longer. Individuals with CS are extremely sensitive to the sunlight and sunburn easily so they mostly stay indoors during normal daylight hours. CS is often described as a 'progeria-like syndrome'. 'Our study suggests that a high-fat diet can postpone ageing processes. A diet high in fat also seems to postpone the ageing of the brain. 'The findings therefore potentially imply that patients with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease in the long term may benefit from the new knowledge.' Researchers explained our brain has a constant need for fuel in the form of either sugar or ketones. Ketones are the brain's fuel reserve, and play an important role in periods of low blood sugar levels, such as when a person is fasting. This is because the body breaks down fat if it needs sugar, and during this process it produces ketones. The researchers saw a particular positive effect when the mice were given medium chain fatty acids – coconut oil, for example. Previous research has shown that in children with Cockayne syndrome, ageing is a result of the cell repair mechanism being constantly active. This means it eats into the cell's resources and causes it to age very quickly. 'We therefore hope that a diet with a high content of coconut oil or similar fats will have a beneficial effect, because the brain cells are given extra fuel and thus the strength to repair the damage,' said Morten Scheibye-Knudsen, from the National Institute of Health, who also carried out the study. The research was published in the journal Cell Metabolism. High fat diets also postponed ageing of the brain. Experts said fats such as coconut oils could be used to stave off Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease (file pic)","Researchers analysed mice with a defect in their DNA repair system .

"Hackers who stole thousands of credit card numbers from U.S. security firm Stratfor are now set to release 2.7 million of its confidential emails. The loose-knit Anonymous movement vowed to heap further embarrassment on the intelligence company, dubbed the 'Shadow CIA', it hacked over Christmas. It wants to humiliate the firm, which . uses a global network of sources to create daily intelligence briefings . on security and financial risk, by publishing the communications. And it said they could provide the 'smoking gun for a number of crimes'. Stolen: Hacking group 'Anonymous' is set to publish 2.7 million emails sent from Stratfor's global network of sources . Anonymous posted the credit card numbers of 30,000 of its clients - including executives from HSBC and Barclays and a member of the House of Lords - on Monday. They were then used, it claimed, to donate $1 million to charity. Activist Barrett Brown told The Times that, if the emails were published, the sources risked exposure. He said: 'People talking off the record to a think-tank are going to disclose a lot of information. Their identities are likely to be in the emails. 'Both my grandfathers dropped bombs on . people. I'm not blowing up any villages. I want to not inconvenience or . damage people but, if we do, I'm not terribly worried about it. 'We're in a state of conflict with the Government. Either we are going to jail or we're going to win.' Promising more: Anonymous recently hacked into think-tank Stratfor pictured above, and stole thousands of emails . He said the emails could 'provide the smoking gun for a number of crimes of extraordinary importance' and revealed Stratfor may have the opportunity to redact some of the communications. The threat to publish the emails mirrors that of Wikileaks who leaked thousands of unredacted diplomatic cables earlier this year. A total of 1,195 British credit cards have been leaked. Anonymous boasted on Monday of stealing Stratfor's confidential client list, which includes entities ranging from Apple Inc to the U.S. Air Force to the Miami Police Department, and mining it for more than 4,000 credit card numbers, passwords and home addresses. The hackers said Stratfor, based in Austin, Texas and who charges subscribers for its reports and analysis, were 'clueless' when it came to database security. They taunted on a message on Twitter: 'Not so private and secret anymore?' before promising that the attack was just the beginning of a Christmas-inspired assault on a long list of targets. Anonymous said the client list it had already posted was a small slice of the 200 gigabytes worth of plunder it stole from Stratfor and promised more leaks. It said it was able to get the credit card details in part because Stratfor did not bother encrypting them - an easy-to-avoid blunder which, if true, would be a major embarrassment for any security-related company. Fred Burton, Stratfor's vice president of intelligence, said the company had reported the intrusion to law enforcement and was working with them on the investigation. And he added that Stratfor has protections in place meant to prevent such attacks. He said: 'But I think the hackers live in this kind of world where once they fixate on you or try to attack you it's extraordinarily difficult to defend against.'","Stratfor has been dubbed the 'Shadow CIA'

"A fraternity leader at the University of Virginia said Monday that a female student's account of being gang-raped by seven men during a party made him 'sick to my stomach.' Tommy Reid, president of the U.Va. Inter-Fraternity Council, said during a news conference called by student leaders that a temporary ban on fraternity activities will give the Greek system a chance to 'take a breath' and come up with solutions. The ban was imposed after Rolling Stone magazine published an article detailing the woman's account and describing what it called a hidden culture of sexual violence. Scroll down for video . Disgusted: Tommy Reid (right), the president of University of Virginia's Inter-Fraternity Council, said Monday that he was sickened by one fellow-student's account of gang rape two years ago at the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity. The victim identified as 'Jackie' told her story in an article that was pubslished last Wednesday by Rolling Stone magazine.

The school had appointed a former federal judge and prosecutor to investigate its response to rape allegations, but that was withdrawn because the man had been a member of Phi Kappa Psi in college. In the meantime, the university's Board of Visitors is scheduled to discuss the allegations and the university's policies and procedures regarding sexual assaults at its meeting Tuesday.

"Eating 28g of yoghurt daily - around a quarter of a small pot – cuts the odds of developing the disease by almost a fifth, a study found. The research, from the Harvard School of Public Health in the US, suggests the popular food could provide an inexpensive and easy way of boosting the odds of a healthy old age. Type 2 diabetes, the form of the condition studied, is fuelled by obesity. It usually develops in middle-age and over time triggers disabling and deadly complications, from blindness to heart attacks and strokes. A study has found that eating just 28g of yoghurt daily - around a quarter of a small pot – cuts the odds of developing diabetes by almost a fifth . It eats up a tenth of the NHS budget and with some 3million sufferers in the UK alone and numbers rising as the obesity epidemic bites, anything that prevents it could have a massive impact health as well as on the healthcare system. The US researchers began by crunching together the results of three long-term studies into diet and health. These involved almost 200,000 men and women, who were studied for up to 30 years and provided detailed information on their diet. All were free of diabetes at the start of the study but 15,156 had developed it by the end. Analysis of their diet showed no link between the disease and their total intake of dairy products. Milk or cheese alone had no effect. However, eating yoghurt seemed to stave off the disease. The researchers then added in data from other studies, meaning they had information on almost half a million people. This showed that one 28 helping of yoghurt a day cut the odds of type 2 diabetes by 18 per cent. Type 2 diabetes, the form of the condition studied, is fuelled by obesity and usually develops in middle-age. File photo . Senior researcher Frank Hu (CORR) said: ‘We found that higher intake of yoghurt is associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, whereas other dairy foods and consumption of total dairy did not show this association. ‘The consistent findings for yoghurt suggest that it can be incorporated into a healthy dietary pattern.’ Professor Hu’s research, published in the journal BMC Medicine (MUST CREDIT), follows other work that has credited yoghurt with keeping people trim. It is thought that the bacteria in yoghurt help keep the metabolism on an even keel. They may also replace bugs in our stomachs that would normally pump out obesity-fuelling toxins. It is also possible that people who regularly eat yoghurt have it as a dessert and so eat fewer sweet puddings than others. Dr Alasdair Rankin, of charity Diabetes UK, said: ‘This work adds to existing evidence that people who eat yoghurt are less likely to develop type 2 diabetes, but what it doesn’t tell us is whether eating yoghurt can directly reduce risk of type 2 diabetes. ‘It could be that those eating yoghurt who took part in the study were more likely to lead a healthy lifestyle, which we know can help to reduce risk of type 2 diabetes. ‘That is why more research will be needed before we can change our advice that the best way to reduce risk of type 2 diabetes is by maintaining a healthy weight, being physically active and eating a healthy balanced diet that is low in salt, fat and sugar.’","Research suggests yoghurt could be an easy and inexpensive way to boots odds of a healthy old age .

"NFL bad boy Johnny Manziel was involved a fight during the early hours of Saturday morning after a member of his entourage attacked a fan for trying to hug the rookie quarterback, according to a police report. Manziel, who has gained a reputation for making headlines for his off-the-field antics, has been relatively quiet since joining the Cleveland Browns after the NFL Draft in May. But at 2.36 a.m. on Saturday police were called to The 9, the high-end apartment complex where Manziel lives, following a report of a ‘riot’ involving 20 men and two security guards in the lobby. The Cleveland Browns quarterback was involved in a fight during the early hours of Saturday morning after a member of his entourage attacked a fan for trying to hug the rookie quarterback . Chris Gonos, the alleged victim in the incident, told Cleveland Scene that the brawl began when he noticed Manziel while waiting for an elevator. Gonos said he approached Manziel and said: 'I'm the biggest Browns fan ever, I love you, I want to give you a hug.' As Gonos stepped toward Manziel, he was punched in the face and beaten by another men with the Browns quarterback, leaving Gonos with a swollen lip and swollen right eye. ‘One of his buddies like tackled me,’ Gonos told the website. ‘It was going down, a whole bunch of people started fighting. It ended pretty quick. I got a bruised hip and a bruised elbow and somebody hit me in the back of the head.’ Chris Gonos, left, the alleged victim in the incident said the brawl began after he approached Manziel, right, and asked if he could hug him . Gonos said no-one was arrested but his brother ‘tackled’ Manziel and added, ‘I guess Johnny sucker-punched him while the security guard was holding him. It should be all on video. ‘I know somebody else in the group smashed Johnny right in the face. Smashed him.’ Manziel's agent Erik Burkhardt has denied the quarterback was with an entourage. ‘Johnny and his roommate had been out to dinner earlier in the evening with Johnny's mother, who is staying with him this week,' he said in a statement. ‘There was no entourage. Johnny and his roommate were trying to get on the apartment elevator at his home when they were accosted by a very aggressive man and his associates. Manziel, who has gained a reputation for making headlines for his off-the-field antics, has been relatively quiet since joining the Cleveland Browns after the NFL Draft in May . 'It was an unfortunate situation and he immediately let [Browns general manager] Ray Farmer and the team know what happened.’ Browns general manager Farmer said in a statement the team is looking into the matter. ‘We are aware of the incident and are in the process of gathering additional information in order to gain a complete understanding of what occurred,’ Farmer said. ‘Nonetheless, the time of the incident is concerning to us. We continually stress to all of our players the importance of sound decision-making in an effort to avoid putting themselves in these types of situations. We have addressed this appropriately with the player and will have no further comment at this time.’ The Browns played Sunday in Atlanta, winning on a field goal with the final play of the game. Manziel, a first-round choice in last May's NFL Draft, was fined by the NFL for making an obscene gesture in a pre-season loss to Washington.","Police were called to Manziel's apartment complex after a report of a 'riot' involving 20 men and two security guards at 2.36 a.m. on Saturday .

"Bill Organ’s sight was saved by injections of the drugs Avastin and Lucentis. Without them, the retired submarine captain would have lost his central vision — including his ability to recognise faces, drive, watch TV, or read books. Both drugs stop the loss of central vision caused by age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of blindness. ‘The wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in my right eye was picked up shortly after I noticed problems with my sight. I had started seeing straight lines as wavy ones, said Bill Organ, aged 71 . The condition, which affects 500,000 people in the UK, comes in two forms: the ‘dry’ form, which progresses slowly, and for which there is no treatment, and the ‘wet’ form, which affects one in ten AMD sufferers. The latter form is more rapid, and can rob a person of sight within weeks or even days. Wet AMD, which Bill, 71, was diagnosed with five years ago, develops when abnormal blood vessels form underneath the macula — the central part of the retina responsible for seeing fine details — and damage its cells. ‘The wet AMD in my right eye was picked up shortly after I noticed problems with my sight. 'I had started seeing straight lines as wavy ones. 'For instance, lampposts, road markings and window frames would all look like they had kinks,’ says Bill, who lives in Winchester, Hampshire, with his wife Joy, also 71. Treatments for the condition — Lucentis, Avastin and a newer drug called Eylea — are injected directly into the eye. They help stop the growth of blood vessels in the eye, as well as preventing them from leaking, which helps to preserve and improve vision. Since his diagnosis, Bill has had upwards of 24 injections of all three medications. ‘The sight in my right eye has been restored to almost normal — I can still drive, play bridge and read,’ he says. ‘The injections saved me from going blind.’ Yet despite Lucentis and Avastin being equally effective and safe, Avastin is not widely available to patients. This is because it was originally devised as a cancer treatment, and so is not officially permitted to be used for AMD (although it can be prescribed on a case-by-case basis, if the doctor accepts personal responsibility). Independent trials, the latest of which was published in the influential Cochrane Reviews, have deemed the treatment safe for AMD. ‘The sight in my right eye has been restored to almost normal,' said Bill . Yet the Government watchdog, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), has not approved the drug for use in AMD patients — because it has not been officially licensed for this use — instead recommending that doctors use Lucentis or Eylea. Campaigners warn this is leaving patients without a treatment option, as the drug can be used in patients for whom Lucentis and Eylea don’t work. Furthermore, not being allowed to use Avastin means that the already cash-strapped NHS is having to spend a fortune on the other drugs needlessly. Lucentis costs around £700 per injection, while Avastin is nearly eight times cheaper, at £90 per injection (Eylea is the most expensive at around £900 per injection). Each patient usually needs around 12 jabs in a lifetime. Experts believe using Avastin, which is just as effective, could free up funds for treatment for other patients. Professor Andrew Lotery, consultant ophthalmologist at Southampton General Hospital, says most macular patients are still given the more expensive Lucentis — which is costing the NHS an extra £102 million a year. ‘This could be better spent on delivering other treatments for patients,’ he says. ‘At the moment, eye departments are so overstretched that they are struggling to see AMD patients in time for them to have their first injections, which should be given within two weeks. ‘Patients are going blind waiting to be treated in some cases.’ However, Professor Lotery, who co-authored a piece in last week’s British Medical Journal with the president of the Royal College of Ophthalmologists, which called for Avastin to be made available on the NHS, says the issue is complex and steeped in red tape. Although Avastin is licensed for bowel, breast, kidney and lung cancers, it isn’t licensed for AMD. Doctors only began using Avastin for AMD when they noticed that patients who were being treated for cancer reported their macular degeneration improved. It is up to the pharmaceutical company that manufactures Avastin — Roche — to apply for a licence for AMD, but this would require further clinical trials. Critics say that the firm has little commercial incentive to do this as, globally, it also manufactures the more expensive Lucentis (though it is marketed by company Novartis within the EU). Indeed Roche and Novartis were jointly fined €182.5 million by the Italian Anti-Trust Authority for ‘cartelising the sales of two major ophthalmic drugs’ — although both of the companies have denied this and an appeal is pending. The authority said that the two companies ‘colluded to exclude the cheap drug Avastin to channel demand towards the most expensive drug, Lucentis’. Until Avastin is licensed, NICE cannot approve its use. When a drug is not officially licensed for a condition, doctors need to prescribe the treatment ‘off-label’. However, Professor Lotery says the General Medical Council (GMC) states doctors should not use an unlicensed treatment where a licensed one exists. The cash-strapped NHS is having to spend a fortune on the other drugs needlessly . ‘Doctors risk personal liability and, technically, could even be struck off, or sued by a patient, if they use it,’ he warns. ‘We want the Department of Health to apply for a licence for Avastin. ‘There isn’t a precedent for this, but we would argue this is an exceptional case and the evidence is there to support this drug’s safety and effectiveness. NICE could then consider if this should be a recommended treatment. ‘Failing that, the GMC should indicate doctors will not face misconduct charges if they prescribe Avastin. We need some leadership from the Department of Health and GMC on this.’ The Macular Society charity is also calling for NICE to assess whether Avastin can be used for AMD. And John Harris, professor of bioethics at the University of Manchester, says it is ‘arguably immoral and unethical not to use Avastin’. ‘There seems to be no reason at all why the NHS should not use Avastin in preference to Lucentis,’ he says. A Roche spokeswoman confirmed the company has no plans to apply for a licence for Avastin to treat macular conditions or other eye conditions. A Novartis spokeswoman said: ‘As it is not a Novartis medicine, we are not in a position to comment on it.’ While the bureaucratic battles rage on, patients who suffer from other rarer eye conditions that also affect central vision, such as Vicky Smith, 30, are facing a fight to get any treatment with Avastin on the NHS at all. Vicky — who lives in Bungay, Suffolk, with her partner, Steve, 33, and their son, Tristan, 22 months — suffers from punctate inner choroidopathy (PIC), a rare eye condition, which can also cause loss of central vision and blind spots. ‘I first noticed I had a problem with my sight when I closed one of my eyes when applying eyeliner,’ says Vicky. ‘I realised that there was a big dot blocking the centre of my vision in my right eye.’ Doctors told Vicky she needed injections into her eye straight away — or would go blind within six months. ‘To make matters worse, I was told that Avastin, the treatment that could help, was not available on the NHS, as the drug wasn’t licensed to treat this condition,’ she says. Even if she could find a doctor who would prescribe the treatment off-label, Vicky says ‘the cost of having each injection privately would be £600 to £1,000’. ‘I didn’t have the money. The local NHS Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) turned down my application for funding, saying it wasn’t a licensed treatment.’ After Vicky’s local paper ran a story about her plight, the local CCG agreed to pay for the first injection. ‘I’ve since needed four more injections,’ she says. ‘But, each time, I’ve had to apply to the CCG again — it’s maddening. Avastin needs to be licensed for eye conditions.’ Bill Organ echoes her frustration. ‘The money saved could be invested into finding new treatments for other eye conditions,’ he says. ‘We need to use some common sense here.’ macularsociety.org .","Bill Organ’s sight saved by injections of the drugs Avastin and Lucentis .

"Brave Harmonie-Rose's beaming smile masks the  ordeal she has faced in her short life. Just 10 days after taking her first steps the toddler was struck by a bout of meningitis. The killer bug left her fighting for her life, with doctors telling her devastated parents Freya Hall and Ross Allen, their only child had a 10 per cent chance of surviving. Harmonie-Rose lost both her legs, and both arms to the disease. Doctors were forced to remove the tip of her nose and warned her parents she could suffer long-term vision learning problems. But despite all she has faced, the toddler finally has a huge smile back on her face as she begins  her road to recovery. Harmonie-Rose Allen, one, is beaming again after losing both arms and both legs when she was struck by a bout of meningitis in September. The killer bug struck just 10 days after she took her first steps . Miss Hall, 20, said she and Mr Allen are 'extremely proud' of their brave daughter. 'She has such a strong character and its beginning to come back now, she knows what she wants,' she said. 'She has got her smile back. 'Ross and I are extremely proud of Harmonie, she has come so far and fought so hard to be here with us. 'We will make her life as amazing fulfilling as we can. She's our perfect little princess and she will always be perfect. 'To be told that she had 10 per cent chance of survival and to be here now is incredible and means so much to us how hard she's fought. 'I don't know what I would do without her.' The couple first noticed something was wrong with Harmonie-Rose in September, when she woke in the night coughing and unable to breathe. They took her to the Royal United Hospital in Bath but doctors could not find anything seriously wrong and she was sent home. Harmonie-Rose's parents Freya Hall and Ross Allen first noticed something was wrong when she woke in the night coughing and soon developed a tell-tale rash. Doctors told the couple their daughter had a 10 per cent chance of surviving, preparing them for the worst . Meningitis Research Foundation estimates that there are around 3,400 cases of bacterial meningitis and septicaemia every year in the UK and Ireland. This means that every day nine people become ill with the diseases. With one in ten people dying, a death will occur almost every day. A further two people will be left with life-altering after effects as severe as brain damage, deafness and multiple amputations. Meningitis vaccines offer excellent protection, but they are not yet available for all forms. So it's vital to know meningitis symptoms and what to do if you suspect someone has meningitis or septicemia. Symptoms of meningitis and septicaemia: . Other signs in babies: .

But the next morning Harmonie-Rose turned blue and they took her back to the same hospital. Following an assessment they were told it was just a virus and were again sent home. But hours later Harmonie-Rose became floppy and lethargic and they rushed back to the hospital, where a rash was spotted. Within four hours, the toddler's body was covered with the purple rash, leaving her parents lost for words. Miss Hall, a full-time mother, said: 'She had a cold for about a week before we took her to the hospital but she was also teething. 'She was still happy and playing right up until we took her to the hospital the second time. 'We saw the spot on her nose and it did not go away, the nurse acted very fast and within seconds her room was filled with doctors and nurses. 'Every time we looked at Harmonie she was becoming covered with more purple like bruises. 'Harmonie was then taken to adult intensive care and we did not hear from them until about four hours later. 'When we walked in to see Harmonie I could have fainted. 'She was asleep and was more covered in the rash than before, this was when we realised it was really severe. 'The doctors told us she would lose the tip of her nose and that was only if she survived. 'He told us he was very worried about our little girl and that she may not survive, my whole life was turned upside down within a second I was so angry and upset. 'The rash was literally covering her from head to toe, it was purple and a dark purple. 'Gradually the whole of her arms and legs were purple; they weren't just dots anymore, they had changed the colour of Harmonie's skin.' Harmonie-Rose has undergone more than 10 operations and is now out of immediate danger, but her mother says she still faces a number of challenges on her road to recovery. Since the youngster's diagnosis, friends, family and members of the public have been raising funds to help Harmonie. The brave toddler, pictured with her mother, fought the bug, but doctors were forced to amputate her arms and legs, as well as the tip of her nose. She has undergone 10 operations but is now out of immediate danger . Friends and family have helped raise more than £60,000 for the Help4Harmonie appeal to help pay for the one-year-old's future rehabilitation, hydrotherapy and adaptations to her home . To date the Help4Harmonie appeal has raised more than £60,000, which will be used for rehabilitation, hydrotherapy and home adaptations. Her mother added: 'Hope4Harmonie have just hit the £60,000 mark and it's incredible. Thanks to our families who started it. 'The support has really helped and it's overwhelming. People from all over the world are supporting Hope4Harmonie. 'Life will never be easy for Harmonie but knowing we have this kind of support fills me with warmth that Harmonie will lead as normal life as possible.'

"An obese woman left devastated when doctors said she was infertile has defied the odds by losing half her body weight - and giving birth to a baby boy. Cassie Collings, 24, went to the doctors after years of trying for a baby, suspecting her 24 stone body was the reason she couldn't conceive. Despite years of dieting she was unable to shift the excess weight, and  ballooned to a size 26. But tests revealed she was suffering with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which causes weight gain and fertility problems. Cassie Collings, 24, was devastated to be told she was infertile due to polycystic ovary syndrome and obesity. But after losing half her body weight she fell pregnant and gave birth to son Harvey in October 2013 . Mrs Collings had ballooned to 24 stone, making her a size 26 (left). After a gastric bypass operation in 2012 she lost 12 stone in just six months (right). Despite signing up for IVF treatment she fell pregnant naturally . After undergoing gastric bypass surgery in July 2012, Mrs Collings, who works in a bingo hall, lost an incredible 12 stone - half her body weight - in just six months. Desperate to be a mother, she signed up for IVF treatment immediately, even though doctors said it would be risky so soon after her operation. She was stuneed when she fell pregnant naturally in February 2013, and gave birth to her 'miracle' son Harvey in October. Mrs Collings, from Redcar, North Yorkshire, said: 'I went to my GP initially because I was concerned that I hadn't fallen pregnant. 'He ordered a scan and sat me down to tell me I had polycystic ovaries and was infertile. 'I was devastated. When I asked what I could do he suggested IVF, but said I wouldn't be eligible because I was so fat. 'I was a vicious circle. I couldn't lose weight because of my condition, but I couldn't have treatment because I was fat. Mrs Collings is pictured with husband Graeme, 27, before her weight loss. The pair had been trying to conceive a baby for 18 months before Mrs Collings went to the GP and was diagnosed with PCOS . Mrs Collings said before she was diagnosed she had battled with her weight for years, trying every diet under the sun. Here, she is pictured with husband Graeme before she underwent gatric bypass operation . Polycystic ovary syndrome is a common condition affecting millions of women in the UK. The three main features are: . Polycystic ovaries contain a large number of harmless cysts, up to 8"" in size. They are under-developed sacs in which eggs develop. Often in PCOS, these sacs are unable to release an egg, meaning ovulation does not take place. It is estimated one in five women in the UK have the condition. Symptoms include: . The condition is linked with an increased risk of other problems later in life, including type 2 diabetes and high cholesterol levels. PCOS is associated with abnormal hormone levels in the body, including high levels of insulin. There is no cure, but it can be treated. Losing weight and maintaining a healthy diet can help reduce some symptoms. Medications can also help combat hair growth, irregular periods and fertility problems. Source: NHS Choices . 'I tried slimming tablets and they didn't work. 'I tried everything and finally I was recommended for surgery. 'I went to a seminar about the options and chose to book for a gastric bypass.' Mrs Collings underwent surgery in June 2012 at the James Cook University Hospital in Middlesborough. She lost a massive two-and-a-half stone in the first month and by the beginning of 2013 she had dropped a stunning 12 stone - half her body weight. Prior to surgery doctors warned Mrs Collings that she couldn't go for IVF for two years following the operation as it would put her at high risk of miscarriage or further complications. But shockingly she fell pregnant naturally in February 2013 - just seven months after her operation. She was taken into hospital and monitored three times a week throughout her pregnancy. She said: 'When I found out I was pregnant I was so happy and excited but at the same time worried sick. 'The doctors said that of all the women who had fallen pregnant after having the surgery at the hospital, none of the babies had survived. 'I was told to expect the worst and put on consultant-led care. 'I was in hospital at least three times a week and constantly scared I would lose my baby. 'Each week I got past was a miracle.' In order to force herself to eat, she would set an alarm every hour, waking up to eat tiny portions including a handful of peanuts or a bite of toast. On October 24 2013, at 38 weeks, Mrs Collings went into labour. After six hours, son Harvey was born weighing a healthy 7lb 10oz. She said: 'Holding Harvey made everything I went through worth it. 'He was our miracle baby we never thought we would have. He beat all the odds.' Mrs Collings was advised not to go for IVF treatment for two years after her gastric bypass operation she risked miscarriage. She was stunned to fall pregnant naturally in February 2013.

"‘It wasn’t that painful, but it left five deep wounds above my ankle,' said Gillian Mayer of her leg injury . Gillian Mayer was dismayed when wounds on her right leg still hadn’t healed after several weeks. They’d been caused by a garden ladder toppling over and landing on her leg in August. ‘It wasn’t that painful, but it left five deep wounds above my ankle,’ says Gillian, 62. ‘The top layer of skin on the wounds had come off so I pushed it back into place and cleaned and dressed the wounds before finishing my gardening and taking my dog for a walk.’ A few days later, on a friend’s advice, she saw her GP, who recommended that the practice nurse dress the wounds, which covered an eight-square-inch area, every week. After a few weeks, it became apparent they weren’t healing. ‘It was sore and I was concerned about getting an infection,’ says Gillian, a retired shop worker from Hillingdon, West London. Because she’d had skin cancer on her neck two years ago, she was already under the care of a plastic surgery team at nearby Mount Vernon Hospital. Five weeks after her leg injury, she had a routine appointment there and showed them the wounds. She was told that she’d need a skin graft — where skin is removed from a ‘donor’ site and transferred to the wound. This site is usually the thigh, because it’s fleshy and any scarring is not usually exposed to view. Around 37,800 skin grafts are carried out each year in England alone. They are done for wounds that won’t heal, including surgical wounds, burns, bed sores, diabetic foot ulcers and venous ulcers, which develop as a result of persistently high blood pressure in the leg veins and damage the skin. When wounds fail to heal, the only options are to undergo further surgery to try to redo the scar or to use a skin graft. Grafts are usually offered for larger wounds after four to six weeks if they haven’t healed, says Toby Richards, a consultant vascular surgeon at the Royal Free Hospital and University College Hospital, both in London. ‘It was sore and I was concerned about getting an infection,’ said Gillian of her wounds . Normally a skin graft is an operation done under anaesthetic, which involves cutting skin away from the donor site, taking the top layer, the epidermis, and some of the layer underneath (the dermis). The skin is usually ‘shaved off’ the thigh with a sharp knife. This effectively creates another wound, which can be painful and may scar. ‘Unfortunately, it is often the elderly, who have thinner skin making them prone to bruising and cuts, who have wounds that fail to heal, and because their skin is more fragile they also have more problems at the donor site,’ says Mr Richards. ‘It can even mean this new wound fails to heal, making a new problem.’ But Gillian’s nurse suggested a new technique, CelluTome, which is an out-patient procedure and does not require surgery or anaesthetic. ‘I was told there was a new machine that sucks up a layer of skin from the thigh instead of cutting it out with a knife, then places it on a wound.’ The device consists a small ‘head’ the size of a smartphone, which is connected to a control unit via a tube. The head is attached to the thigh for 30 to 45 minutes, sometimes longer, with an elastic strap. The control unit uses heat (it warms the skin to 40c) and slight vacuum pressure to create tiny visible suction blisters on the skin the width of a split pea and 2mm high. A fine knife attached to the head then shaves the blisters off in a controlled manner. They are the epidermis, which is only a few cells thick so there is minimal discomfort, explains Mr Richards. A sticky dressing is then placed over the ultra-thin layer of cells to pick them up and then they are transferred to the wound like a plaster. Once the epidermal cells are placed onto a wound they start to grow and form a layer of skin across the wound. This takes four weeks — around the same time as a conventional skin graft takes to fully heal, Mr Richards adds. The donor site doesn’t need any dressing because only the epidermis has been taken and it does not scar. ‘I was told there was a new machine that sucks up a layer of skin from the thigh instead of cutting it out with a knife, then places it on a wound,' said Gillian . Gillian had the procedure last month at the plastic surgery department of the Royal Free, London, one of three centres in Europe using CelluTome. University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff and a hospital in the Netherlands are the others. ‘I felt no pain, and there was no bleeding from the site on my thigh,’ says Gillian. ‘The whole thing took around an hour-and-a-half, then I left straight away. The donor site healed in less than a week.’ She still has weekly appointments to redress the wounds. Three wounds healed completely after four weeks, leaving the skin just slightly red. The other two had become infected, and Gillian needed antibiotics, but they have now almost healed. Mr Richards says the device has mostly been used for wounds to the lower leg (‘pretibial lacerations’) but is being considered for surgical wounds, as well as venous leg ulcers and diabetic foot ulcers. However, it is suitable only for small wounds between the size of a 50p piece and the size of a hand, because that’s how big the device’s head is. Another patient to benefit is John Zazzera, 84. Four years ago, the former taxi driver had a wound from a surgical incision that wouldn’t heal in the middle of his stomach. He’d had numerous operations there, including one for a hernia. Then earlier this year, a nurse told him about CelluTome, and he had the procedure done three months ago. ‘I felt a slight burning when the device was on my thigh, but it was nothing I couldn’t cope with,’ says John, a widower from North London who has two daughters and two granddaughters. ‘It’s improved significantly — the wound is now 1cm wide compared with 5 in wide before.’ So far, 50 patients in Europe have had CelluTome. Results are very positive, says Mr Richards. CelluTome is routinely carried out across the country. The treatment could cost ten times less than a standard skin graft, which usually involves an operation in theatre and a hospital stay of several days . ‘Next year, formal trials will compare its efficacy with other treatments, and by the end of next year we hope to pinpoint where and for whom it works best.’ But it will be several years before CelluTome is routinely carried out across the country. The treatment could cost ten times less than a standard skin graft, which usually involves an operation in theatre and a hospital stay of several days, says Mr Richards. A single transfer graft with CelluTome costs £300 to the NHS. Demetrius Evriviades, a consultant plastic surgeon at Queen Elizabeth Hospital and BMI The Priory Hospital, Birmingham, says: ‘This appears to be a promising technology to help difficult-to-treat small wounds in an outpatient setting, especially for pretibial lacerations in the elderly,’ he says. ‘It can be problematic to perform traditional skin grafts on the elderly, as the donor site may not heal. 'And these patients may not be in the best health so they are often not ideal candidates for anaesthetic and surgery. ‘However, I await proper clinical trials to show that it works. I wouldn’t use it until there is evidence of its benefit.’","Gillian Mayer's wounds on right leg failed to heal .

"Switching to a vegetarian diet could help reverse diabetes, a new study claims. Millions of people battling the killer disease could improve their blood sugar levels by eradicating meat from their weekly shop. Scientists believe removing animal fats could help cure the condition, leaving patients free from the disease. They said changes to diet could be used as an alternative treatment for type 2 diabetes. An analysis of previous studies revealed removing animal fats from diet helps improve insulin sensitivity. Scroll down for videos . A vegetarian diet can significantly improve blood sugar levels and manage type 2 diabetes, a study found . Eating a vegetable-based diet reduced levels of a key blood-protein called glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c). For people with diabetes, the higher the HbA1c in their blood, the greater the risk of developing diabetes-related complications such as nerve damage, eye problems, and heart disease. The study found a vegan or vegetarian diet lowered HbA1c by an average of 0.4 percentage points, and up to 0.7 points. This is comparable to the effects of drugs given to help patients with diabetes control their blood-sugar levels, researchers said. 'A diet change beats a pill,' said dietitian Susan Levin, one of the study's authors. 'A plant-based diet improves blood sugar, body weight, blood pressure, and cholesterol all at the same time, something no drug can do.' Dr Neal Barnard, of the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences, added: 'Plant-based diets work in a different way than ""conventional"" diabetes diets. 'We now know that type 2 diabetes is caused by insulin resistance. Getting the animal fat — and fats in general — out of the diet helps repair insulin's ability to function.' He told the Daily Express: 'We tell patients they can eat as much as they want – and as much whole wheat pasta, whole grains, and brown rice as they want – as long as they're not eating ­animal products or lots of added oils. Eating a vegan  or a vegetarian diet  lowered levels of a key blood protein. The effect was comparable to drugs which prevent the digestion of carbohydrates . 'The diet is simple and clear, and it's easier than ever to follow. With a plant-based diet, we could help tackle the disease once and for all.' He said the 'side effects' are beneficial, people lose weight, blood pressure improves and cholesterol levels drop. And he added 'best of all', vegan diets remove the tedious routine of taking medication and injecting insulin. Across the world, 347 million people have diabetes, according to the World Health Organization. They predict it will be the seventh leading cause of death by 2030. The condition occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin to take sugar out of the bloodstream, or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Removing animal fats helps improve sensitivity to insulin, a hormone which controls blood sugar . Over time diabetes can lead to raised blood sugar levels, which causes damage to many of the body's systems, especially the nerves and blood vessels. This damage can lead to blindness, amputation, heart disease, kidney failure and stroke. As part of the new study, researchers analysed the dietary patterns of 255 adults with type 2 diabetes in the U.S, Brazil, and the Czech Republic. They found people who ate low-fat vegan diet, or a diet of egg and dairy products but no meat, lowered HbA1c by an average of 0.4 percentage points and up to 0.7 points in some studies. This is comparable to the same effect of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, drugs given to patients that help control their blood-glucose levels by preventing the digestion of carbohydrate, they said. Writing in the report, the researchers said: 'Vegetarian (including vegan) diets have benefits for cardiovascular health, hypertension, body weight, and plasma lipids, and also provide nutritional advantages compared with omnivorous diets.' A vegetarian diet also contains fewer calories, therefore helping patients manage their weight, a risk factor for type 2 diabetes. Plant-based diets tend to be higher in fibre, which slows the rate sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream, researchers added. Swapping meat proteins for soy proteins have also been shown to improve insulin sensitivity and lower cholesterol. Therefore, a vegetarian diet  could be used as a 'treatment alternative for type 2 diabetes, they concluded. The research was published in the journal Cardiovascular Diagnosis And Therapy.","Vegetarian and vegan diets can significantly improve blood sugar levels .

"A mother diagnosed with terminal cancer is preparing for what could be her last Christmas after doctors mistook bleeding and cramping as signs of pregnancy. Samantha Beaven went into premature labour with her second daughter at just 26 weeks. It was only then that doctors discovered the 28-year-old had cervical cancer. She barely had time to come to terms with the news when her daughter Daisy was born 14 weeks early, drastically underweight at 2lb 2oz and battling for life. Both mother and daughter were treated in the same hospital but while Daisy is now thriving, Mrs Beaven has been told her cancer has spread and is now terminal. Samantha Beaven, 28 (centre), has incurable cancer and has been told she has just 12 to 18 months left with her two daughters, Bracken, six (right) and Daisy, one month old (left) In May she was given 12 to 18 months to live. But she has vowed to fight the illness for as long as possible for the sake of Daisy and her older daughter Bracken, six. She decided to marry her partner - and the girls' father - Alex, and is determined to give her family their best Christmas ever knowing it may be their last together. Mrs Beaven said: ‘I have promised them I will be here for them for as long as I can. 'There are times when I feel overwhelmed and scared and then I look at them and I know I have to stay strong. ‘Daisy fought so hard to live after being born so early that I owe her and Bracken the same. ‘I want to make this Christmas so special for them. I hope to create some special memories for us all.’ She is currently funding alternative treatments with donations from well wishers to extend her time with her girls. She said: ‘Every day it buys me with them is worth it and I am extremely grateful to the people who have fundraised to help give me that precocious time. ‘I just want to make enough memories for my girls to last them a lifetime.’ She hopes sharing her story will raise awareness of cervical cancer, especially in pregnant women. ‘People need to know pregnant women can get cervical cancer too,' she told MailOnline. Cervical cancer is an uncommon type of cancer that develops in a woman's cervix, the entrance to the womb from the vagina. Cervical cancer often has no symptoms in its early stages. The most common symptom is unusual vaginal bleeding, which can occur after sex, in-between periods or after the menopause. In the UK, the NHS offers a national screening programme open to all women from the age of 25. During screening, a cervical smear test is performed. A small sample of cells is taken from the cervix and checked under a microscope for abnormalities. If cervical cancer is diagnosed at an early stage, it's usually possible to treat it using surgery. In some cases it's possible to leave the womb in place, but it may need to be removed. The surgical procedure used to remove the womb is called a hysterectomy. Radiotherapy is an alternative to surgery for some women with early stage cervical cancer. In some cases it is used alongside surgery. More advanced cases of cervical cancer are usually treated using a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Some of the treatments used can have significant and long-lasting side effects, including early menopause and infertility. 'The signs were all there but dismissed as pregnancy symptoms and I’m afraid that has cost me my life.’ Mrs Beaven, a primary school teaching assistant from Brighton,  suffered severe bleeding and cramping from the start of her pregnancy. She claims she went to hospital on multiple occasions, but tests had failed to detect the true cause. Mrs Beaven said: ‘I felt strongly that something was very wrong. I’d never experienced anything like it with my first pregnancy. ‘I must have gone to hospital bleeding at least 10 times only to be told nothing was wrong. ‘But eventually I had to take the doctors and midwives at their word and trust that things were OK.’ Fearing she was experiencing contractions just 26 weeks into her pregnancy, Mrs Beaven went to hospital in October 2013. At the Royal Sussex County Hospital a midwife examined her cervix for the first time. She confirmed that at just 26 weeks Mrs Beaven was 2cm dilated but also revealed she had seen a lesion that was causing the bleeding. Mrs Beaven said: ‘Initially I felt relieved to finally have an answer and assurance that my baby was not in danger.’ But it was only when doctors said they needed to perform a biopsy on the 7cm mass that she realised she might be in danger. Doctors administered steroid injections to help her baby’s lungs develop in preparation for birth. Two days later, Mrs Beaven learned she had cancer. She said: ‘When the specialist came to my bedside and said he was an oncologist my heart sank to the pit of my stomach. I knew what it meant. ‘When he said I had cervical cancer my hands went straight to my bump. I just kept saying to him ""but I’m about to have a baby"".’ It became clear that all her symptoms, bleeding, discharge, back pain and stomach pain had slipped under the radar because they are associated with normal pregnancies too. Mrs Beaven said: ‘Of course I was shocked and disappointed that it hadn’t been picked up earlier but there wasn’t time for ifs and buts because I needed to focus on my unborn baby.’ It was discovered Mrs Beaven had cervical cancer when she went into labour with baby Daisy (left) prematurely at 26 weeks. The cancer spread to her lungs and she was told it was terminal. She hopes to make this Christmas, possibly her last, extra special . Doctors agreed they needed to keep the baby, a girl Mrs Beaven and her husband had already named Daisy, inside her to increase her chance of survival. They planned to deliver her by C-section at 30 weeks and perform a full hysterectomy to fight the cancer at the same time. Initially drugs to slow labour worked and Mrs Beaven was sent home to rest. But the following night her waters broke at home and because the baby was breech. She was rushed into surgery on October 27. She said: ‘I came round and saw Alex was smiling. He told me Daisy had been born crying and nobody could believe she was already breathing on her own.’ But the odds were stacked against her as she weighed just 2lbs 2oz, much less than the average of 7lb 4oz for girls in the UK. Mrs Beaven said: ‘At first I was too scared to see her but Daisy was so strong I knew I had to be strong too. I couldn’t touch or hold her but she was so beautiful. Days later Mrs Beaven started chemotherapy and radiotherapy while Daisy continued to make good progress. They were treated in different wards at the same hospital. But at five weeks old Daisy contacted necrotising enterocolitis, a life-threatening bowel condition common in premature babies. After being told she had terminal cancer, Mrs Beaven (right) decided to marry partner Alex (left). They arranged the wedding in two weeks. Here, the pair are pictured on their big day . At seven weeks old she needed surgery to remove a 10cm portion of her bowel. Still weighing just 3lbs, staff warned she may not survive. To their relief and joy, Daisy pulled through and Mrs Beaven drew on her tiny daughter’s strength to fight her own battle. She said: ‘I felt overwhelmed and exhausted. At times I felt utter disbelief that this was happening to us, but I just needed to think of her and my family to keep going.’ Three months after she was born Daisy was finally discharged. Weeks later  more good news came when Mrs Beaven was told her treatment had been a success. Scans had shown there was no longer any sign of cancer in her cervix. Mrs Beaven is currently funding alternative treatments through donations from well-wishers . ‘Since Daisy had been born we had taken life one day at a time, but finally it felt like we could think about the future,' she said. ‘It was like we’d both had death sentences lifted.’ But their joy was short-lived. In May Mrs Beaven developed a nasty cough that wouldn’t shift, so visited her GP. On her fourth visit to the doctor a scan  confirmed her worst fear. The cancer had spread to her lungs and was terminal; she was given 12 to 18 months to live. ‘It was like the rug had been pulled from beneath us all over again,' she said. 'I was in shock. I cried for two weeks solidly. I just couldn’t believe that after all that I was going to be taken from them anyway.’ But after starting the heartbreaking task of making memory boxes and filming videos to be shown to her daughters when they were older, Mrs Beaven instead decided to put her energy into something positive and told family she wanted to get married. The couple had been engaged for three years and Mr Beaven planned their wedding in just two weeks. Their daughters were bridesmaids and shortly after Mrs Beaven started a course of chemotherapy to try and extend her life. She also researched alternative therapies to boost her health allow her to make the most of the time she has left. She is currently funding the treatment, which she says is keeping her strong, from money raised through fundraising and donations from well wishers. She said: ‘Thanks to them I can go on being mum and try to enjoy as much time as possible with my beautiful girls. ‘From what doctors have told me this could be my last Christmas with them so I want to make it the best ever.’ For more information, or to donate, please visit Mrs Beaven's fundraising page.","Samantha Beaven suffered symptoms while pregnant with daughter Daisy .

"A former director of the CIA and the National Security Agency warned on Sunday that the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham, ISIS, is destined to launch attacks on the U.S. and other Western countries in its race to wage jihad and attract followers in the Arab world. 'ISIS is a very powerful local terrorist organization and probably a reasonably powerful regional terrorist organization,' retired Gen. Michael Hayden told a Sunday morning CNN audience, 'but it's one that has global ambitions.' Islamist militants flying the ISIS flag include 'American passport holders' and 'European passport holders,' he said. 'So if it is not Tuesday, it's at a time and place of their choosing. And it will come probably sooner rather than later.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Former CIA chief Michael Hayden said Sunday that ISIS has global ambitions and will certainly mount attacks against the West . 'Soldiers of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria will pass from here soon': An ISIS sympathizer held up this warning -- and a Quran verse -- in front of the Old Republic Building in Chicago, and then tweeted the picture . On other TV networks, a chorus of Republican lawmakers were sounding alarms about the possibility of a 9/11-style ISIS attack on the U.S. ISIS has been in operation for two years without a major challenge, said House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Mike Rogers, 'and that draws people from Britain, across Europe, even the United States to go and join the fight. 'They see that as a winning ideology, a winning strategy,' he said on NBC, and they want to be a part of it, and that’s what makes it so dangerous.' 'They are one plane ticket away from U.S. shores and that’s why we’re so concerned about it.' Jihadis have posted online warnings which, whether serious or not, threaten attacks on U.S. cities. The U.S. Secret Service is investigating a tweeted photo showing someone holding up a smartphone, displaying a picture of the ISIS flag, in front of the White House. '[W]e are here #America near our #target :) sooooooooooooon,' read the message that accompanied it on August 9. The taunting message followed a separate photo that first appeared online on June 30. It showed a hand-written note in Arabic, dated June 20, held up in front of the Old Republic Building in Chicago. 'Soldiers of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria will pass from here soon,' the note read. ISIS taunted the U.S. with a photo taken in front of the White House, showing a smartphone displaying the terror group's flag . A verse from the Quran followed: '... and Allah is perfecting His light even though the disbelievers hate [that].' South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said Sunday on CNN that the White House should 'assume the worst about these guys. They’re not the JV team anymore, they’re the most prominent terrorist organization in the world.' Even more prominent than al-Qaeda, apparently. Hayden said that the group is 'in a competition now with ""al-Qaeda prime,"" the folks along the Afghan- Pakistan border. And there is no way more powerful to express their street credentials among the jihadist community than a successful attack against the West. Ever since the 9/11 Commission released July 2004 report, observers have pointed to one of the group's central conclusions as a warning bell for future generations. America, the panelists wrote, suffered from a 'failure to imagine' the worst calamity a terror group could visit upon a major city. 'We kind of underestimated our opponents in the past,' Hayden agreed on Sunday. 'We certainly did that. We lacked imagination with 9/11. We kind of did that with al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. We knew they were up to something. We just didn't think it was going to be a Nigerian on an airliner over Detroit.' 'Well, we've got the same dynamic here. ... It is not just about defense. It is not just about keeping the right people off of aircraft. It's about offense. It's about disabling ISIS. It is about making them more worried, more consumed with protecting their own survivability rather than threatening yours or mine.' MAYBE NOT: This ISIS militant, who taunted the U.S. in a video interview with the VICE news website, was killed just weeks later in an American airstrike . Arizona Sen. John McCain agreed, telling a Fox News Channel that President Barack Obama should go on offense and strike ISIS in both of the countries where it operates. 'There is no boundary between Syria and Iraq,' McCain said. 'One of the key decisions the president is going to have to make is airpower in Syria. We cannot give them a base of operations.' McCain hinted that not even the recent videotaped beheading of U.S. photojournalist James Foley would likely be enough to jolt the White House into action, despite nearly 100 airstrikes targeted at ISIS strongholds. 'This is an administration which – the kindest word I can use is ""feckless"",' he said, 'where they have not outlined a role that the United States has to play. And that is a leadership role.' 'No more ""leading from behind,"" he demanded. 'No more ""don't do stupid stuff"".'","Michael Hayden told CNN that ISIS is itching to establish its 'street credentials' among global jihadis .

"David Cameron says he wears pyjamas, Donald Duck donned a nightcap and Marilyn Monroe wore just Chanel No 5 — but what is the best thing to wear in bed? It seems that Marilyn might have been on to something. One in three adults sleeps in the nude, according to an international study by the U.S. National Sleep Foundation, and it’s been shown to have all sorts of benefits. Here, experts reveal how ditching pyjamas could improve your sleep quality, boost your relationship and may even help burn calories. Scroll down for video . Some like it cool: Marilyn Monoe, pictured in 1961, famously said she wore only Chanel No 5 in bed. It seems the movie star might have been on to something . GOING NAKED MEANS A GOOD NIGHT’S SLEEP . Sleep experts agree it’s important to keep cool at night as your body (or ‘core’) temperature needs to drop by about half a degree for you to fall asleep. The brain, driven by your internal body clock, sends messages to the blood vessels to open up and release heat. ‘Your core temperature is at its highest at 11pm and its lowest at 4am,’ says Dr Chris Idzikowski, director of the Edinburgh Sleep Centre and author of Sound Asleep: The Expert Guide To Sleeping Well. ‘If anything prevents that decline in temperature, the brain will wake itself up to see what’s going on, meaning you’ll struggle to get to sleep or you’ll have disturbed sleep. ‘The advantage of sleeping naked is it’s easier for the body to cool and maintain the lower temperature the brain wants to achieve.’ Russell Foster, professor of circadian neuroscience at the University of Oxford, says ditching nightwear may improve your slumber. ‘If you’re wearing lots of bedclothes it’s going to be more difficult to regulate your temperature, so wear the least you can get away with.’ Disrupted sleep from being too hot doesn’t just mean you’ll get less sleep overall, but it might mean less deep sleep, the most restorative type. Deep sleep is key for memory consolidation and the production of growth hormone — important for cell repair and growth. Why does the body cool down during sleep? One theory is that it evolved to do this because our ancestors in Africa would grab some rest in the afternoon, and needed to keep cool in the savanna heat. Why sleep naked? Disrupted sleep from being too hot doesn’t just mean you’ll get less sleep overall, but it might mean less deep sleep, the most restorative type . SWAP BED SOCKS FOR A HOT WATER BOTTLE . Though it’s important not to get too hot at night, make sure you have warm hands and feet. That’s because for your temperature to lower to the level that triggers sound sleep, your body needs to lose excess heat. It does this by sending blood to the vessels near skin — in particular, those on the hands and feet — where heat is lost through the skin surface. However, as Professor Foster explains, if your hands and feet are cold, the blood vessels next to the skin constrict and reduce blood flow in an effort to keep warm and stop heat escaping. This in turn means your core temperature won’t be able to drop so easily. This is why people with Raynaud’s syndrome — a disorder characterised by extremely cold hands and feet (thought to affect up to ten million people in the UK, including 10 per cent of all women) are more likely to suffer with insomnia. The condition causes the blood vessels in the extremities to spasm, reducing blood flow, so though sufferers’ hands and feet may feel very cold, their core temperature is too high. Older people tend to feel the cold at night, probably because circulation problems become more common. Women are also more likely to suffer with cold hands and feet, especially at certain points in the menstrual cycle — oestrogen regulates the peripheral blood vessels in the hands and feet, and high levels can make them more sensitive to temperature. A 2008 study by the Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience demonstrated the importance of body temperature in sleep. Volunteers slept wearing thermosuits, allowing researchers to manipulate their skin temperature without altering core temperature. The team found that when skin temperature was raised by just 0.4°C, the volunteers were significantly less likely to wake in the night. In elderly volunteers, the effect was pronounced: the 0.4°C rise almost doubled the proportion of deep sleep and decreased the risk of waking too early from 50 per cent to four per cent. Warming the skin caused blood vessels in the extremities to widen, so heat could be lost more easily. ‘They promoted sleep by raising skin temperature, allowing heat to flow from the middle of the body and the core temperature to fall slightly,’ says Professor Foster. In other words, to fall asleep easily, you need to be warm enough that your blood vessels won’t constrict, but not so hot that your body can’t cool down. To ensure body temperature drops sufficiently, swap bed socks for a hot water bottle, says Dr Idzikowski. ‘Bed socks don’t allow you to lose heat from your feet, so you’ll end up too hot,’ he says. ‘Hot water bottles get your feet warm, but then they cool down or can be kicked out of the way.’ Your bed partner can also be helpful for regulating your body temperature. ‘If you’re cold, you can snuggle up to them and once you’re warm, you can move away,’ says Professor Foster. People who sleep naked have happier love lives, according to a survey of 1,000 British adults by a bedsheet company this year . SLEEP IN THE BUFF TO BURN CALORIES . There is an increasing focus on brown fat, a type of tissue in the body that may protect against weight gain. While ordinary body fat piles on when we eat more calories than we burn, brown fat seems to burn excess calories to generate heat. We know babies have lots of brown fat — they need it to keep warm — but studies have shown there are small amounts in the necks of adults, too. Experts believe that certain activities could switch on this fat, potentially helping to burn calories at a greater rate. In a U.S. study in the journal Diabetes, researchers found that sleeping in a cold bedroom could activate brown fat in adults. Five healthy young men slept in climate-controlled bedrooms for four months. For the first month, the room was kept at 24°C, then it was lowered to 19°C, then it went back to 24°C and for the last month raised to 27°C. They ate the same amount of calories and their calorie expenditure and insulin sensitivity — how much insulin the body needs to keep blood sugar levels stable — were measured each day. The results were striking. After four weeks sleeping at 19°C, the men had almost doubled their volumes of brown fat. ‘The roughened surface provides a warmer feel as it holds air that insulates you.’ Natural fibres such as wool, cotton or silk ‘have a good humidity buffering capacity (they absorb moisture), which will feel better in bed’. Tests showed they burned more calories throughout the day when their bedroom was cooler (though not enough to lose weight) and their insulin sensitivity had also improved. Senior author Francesco S. Celi said the study showed that over time sleeping in a cold bedroom could lessen the risk of diabetes. Michael Symonds, professor of developmental physiology at the University of Nottingham and an expert on brown fat, says sleeping naked may be beneficial. ‘Brown fat can produce 300 times more heat than any other body organ, meaning if you can keep it activated for a prolonged amount of time you’d be less likely to lay down excess energy. ‘So anything you can do to try to activate it, such as lowering the thermostat and sleeping in the cold, may be of benefit.’ But room temperature shouldn’t be below a level at which you feel comfortable, otherwise you won’t sleep. People who tend to feel hot at night and like to sleep naked, may have a high amount of brown fat, which causes them to feel warmer than others. ...AND LOWER BLOOD PRESSURE . Cosy pyjamas are tempting, but if you share a bed with a partner, going nude will generate a generous boost of oxytocin, a hormone that’s been shown to have a wealth of health benefits. ‘It is triggered by closeness, particularly skin-to-skin contact,’ says Dr Kerstin Uvnas-Moberg, a physiologist at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences and an expert on oxytocin. ‘Sensory nerves on the skin send impulses to the brain, triggering the release. ‘When a baby is placed on its mother’s chest, the blood in mother and child starts to pulse with oxytocin.’ Oxytocin has a protective effect on the heart, as it lowers blood pressure. It also boosts the immune system and reduces anxiety. ‘But it only works if skin-on-skin touching is something you’re happy with.’ GIVE YOUR LOVE LIFE A BOOST . People who sleep naked have happier love lives, according to a survey of 1,000 British adults by a bedsheet company this year. The study found 57 per cent of nude sleepers were happy with their relationship, compared with 48 per cent of pyjama wearers and 43 per cent of nightie wearers (onesie wearers were just 38 per cent). Sleeping naked is a good strategy for those with body image issues, says Denise Knowles, sex therapist at counselling charity Relate. ‘You can slip under the sheets and then take your clothes off, and then you can be touched, even if you don’t want to be looked at.’ Sleeping naked may increase the chances of sex. ‘Pyjamas might give the message “not tonight”, but equally a lot of couples have a lot of fun taking each other’s clothes off.’ STOP GETTING INFECTIONS . Wearing nothing to bed can help women avoid developing yeast infections, such as thrush, says Austin Ugwumadu, a consultant gynaecologist at St George’s Hospital in South London. ‘Thrush loves warm, restricted environments, so wear something loose or preferably nothing at all. ‘If you wear something tight it means less air gets to the area and you’re more likely to sweat, which can cause irritation.’","One in three adults sleep in the nude according to a study by U.S. experts .

"A domed helmet, thick boots and overalls coated in a special plastic. This is the suit designed to keep British medics free from Ebola, as they head for parts of west Africa ravaged by the disease. The first wave of NHS volunteers were deployed by the Government this weekend. They were sent to Sierra Leone to join the global effort to control the epidemic. The group of 30 volunteers is made up of GPs, nurses, psychiatrists and emergency medicine consultants. Scroll down for video . Protective: The suit, made by four British companies, contains overalls coated in a special plastic  to stop bodily-fluids getting in. Most of the suit will be burnt after being used to stop the virus spreading . Barrier: British medics join other health workers fighting Ebola in West Africa. Pictured is a Doctors Without Borders (MSF), health worker in protective gear, including a face mask, lightweight overalls and visor . After arriving in Sierra Leone's captital, Freetown, they will complete a week of training before moving to British-built Ebola treatment centres across the virus-ravaged nation. There, they will help diagnose and treat those who have fallen victim to Ebola, which has killed more than 5,000 people - the majority in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. In their fight against the deadly disease, the health workers have been kitted out with special protective suits, made by four British companies. The suits leave no part of a healthcare workers body exposed, providing a crucial barrier designed to keep them safe. The outfits include white overalls coated with a special plastic, which stops bodily fluids including blood, vomit and diarrhoea - which all carry the virus - from passing through the protective layer. The mouth and eyes - two areas most vulnerable to potential transmission - are covered by a mask and visor. Each healthcare worker will wear two pairs of gloves, the outer pair acting as an extra seal. While the suit provides high levels of protection against Ebola, the volunteers have been warned they must be careful when putting the suit on and taking it off. Removing the protective gear in the right order is essential for reducing the risk of contracting the disease. Once removed, the majority of the kit is burned, and replaced to further reduce the risk of transmission. The visor and boots are sprayed with chlorine to kill any trace of the virus. Working in a difficult environment where temperatures soar to more than 30°C, the NHS workers will only work for 45-minute sessions, to prevent heat exhaustion. Each medic's name, role and the time they entered their ward will be written on their aprons to ensure they don't exceed the set time limit.

Dedicated: The volunteer staff, including Annabel Allcorn, Angela Mcbride and Lizzie Marmont (above, from left to right) will complete a week of training before moving to Ebola treatment centres across the country . The importance of protective clothing was highlighted when a doctor treating a Spanish nurse who contracted the virus published an open letter saying his staff was ill-equipped for the job. Dr Juan Manuel Parra claimed the suit he was given to treat Maria Teresa Romero Ramos left his arms exposed as the sleeves were too short for him. Doctors who initially treated her were not properly equipped either he said, wearing only impermeable gowns, double gloves, a hat and a face mask. More teams of volunteers are set to leave the UK in the coming weeks after hundreds came forward to offer their services. They have been preparing for deployment with intensive training at a Ministry of Defence facility in York. Most of the volunteers said they put themselves forward for humanitarian reasons. One of those leaving for Sierra Leone, Dr Hannah Ryan, 29, from the intensive care unit at Aintree University Hospital: 'I guess there are many reasons I volunteered for this; I am interested in infectious disease medicine, I have always wanted to do humanitarian work, I wanted to take on the challenge of working in this complex environment. Prepared: NHS staff will undergo a week's intensive training after arriving in Sierra Leone tomorrow. More teams of volunteers are set to leave in the coming weeks after hundreds came forward to offer their services . 'But mainly I found myself less and less able to hear about the evolving situation in west Africa and the increasing loss of life and do nothing. I felt I just had to go. 'The first aim of this operation is simply to get well-trained staff there to open more treatment centre beds and see more patients, and do it safely. 'I hope more NHS staff, particularly nurses and laboratory staff, will hear about this and be encouraged to volunteer.' Dr Mark Willcox, 26, a GP from the Wirral, said: 'I am in a position to go and help. I was greatly assisted by the Royal College of Surgeons, Dublin in getting a medical education so it's a privilege to give something back. 'We have received superb training by the UK military, who really should be recognised for their outstanding efforts in this crisis. 'My GP practice has been hugely supportive of me going which has been fantastic.' Dr James Lavers, 37, an intensive care registrar from Ysbyty Gwynedd in Bangor, said: 'I decided to volunteer for the Ebola response in Sierra Leone because this could be the biggest medical disaster of my lifetime, killing hundreds of thousands of people in the region. 'To prevent this from happening and save vast numbers of lives, large-scale intervention has to happen now.' Committed: Within a week, British volunteers will be treating patients with the deadly Ebola virus in west Africa. They have been preparing with intensive training at a Ministry of Defence facility in York . Chief Medical Officer Dame Sally Davies said: 'I have been really impressed with the numbers of NHS workers who have stepped forward to help the communities that have been devastated by Ebola. 'The fact more than 1,000 have come forward so far is a real testament to their commitment to public service. 'I want to offer my thanks to all those that are going, their efforts will make a real difference in West Africa.' Previously the Department of Health has said British workers sent to fight the outbreak will not automatically be brought back to the UK for treatment if they become infected. If they catch the virus, a decision to repatriate the patient will be made on a 'case by case' basis, depending on whether it is in the patient's medical interest to return.","Protective suit has been designed by four British companies .

"One of Britain’s most senior judges actively campaigned to support a vile paedophile group that tried to legalise sex with children, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. Lord Justice Fulford, named last year as an adviser to the Queen, was a key backer of the notorious Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE) which police suspect of abusing children on an ‘industrial scale’. An investigation by the Mail on Sunday has discovered that Fulford was a founder member of a campaign to defend PIE while it was openly calling for the age of consent to be lowered to just four. Implicated: Lord Justice Fulford, pictured in his full legal regalia, was named last year as an adviser to the Queen . It can also be revealed that the Appeal Court judge and Privy Counsellor: . Fulford was a founder member of an organisation called Conspiracy Against Public Morals set up to defend PIE leaders facing criminal charges. It later published a sickening pamphlet claiming that children would be freed from the oppression of the state and their parents if they were allowed to have sex with adults. The 60-page document, unearthed by The Mail on Sunday, is adorned with disturbing child-like pictures and sexual cartoons. At the time the organisation went under a slightly different name but had the same postal address as Fulford’s group had. When asked last night about his involvement in the group, Fulford said: ‘I have no memory of having been involved with its foundation or the detail of the work of this campaign.’ He added that any contribution he made would have been in  general terms against a law  banning ‘conspiracy to corrupt public morals’ which he believed ‘could be used against a wide variety of people in potentially inappropriate ways’. ‘I have always been deeply opposed to paedophilia and I never supported the views of the PIE,’ he added. Fulford is the most senior public figure to be implicated in the work of PIE. Today’s revelations follow controversy over the roles of Labour grandees Patricia Hewitt, Harriet Harman and her husband Jack Dromey, who were all involved in the National Council for Civil Liberties (NCCL) when it counted paedophile activists among its members. Last night Fulford said: ‘On reflection the NCCL gay rights committee should never have allowed members of PIE to attend any of its meetings. 'I am very sorry for what happened. I have never espoused or in any way supported the objectives of PIE – the abuse of children – which I consider wholly wrong’. Nonetheless, the revelations are likely to raise questions about what vetting he underwent during his career. However . Fulford insisted ‘There was nothing to report to the Lord Chancellor’s . department... at the time of my various appointments.’ The revelations also prompted fresh . calls for a full investigation of the links between the Establishment . and paedophile groups, following long-running allegations of cover-ups. Scotland . Yard is already looking into PIE as part of Operation Fernbridge, its . probe into allegations of a child sex ring involving senior politicians . at a south London guest house. As The Mail on Sunday revealed last year, the Home Office is also carrying out urgent checks into a whistle-blower’s claims that taxpayers’ money was handed to PIE. Labour MP Tom Watson said: ‘Today’s revelations reinforce the argument that there should be a full investigation into the role of PIE. 'It’s incredible that someone of such distinguished legal authority could misunderstand the need to protect children.’ Tory MP Sir Paul Beresford added: ‘I find it staggering. It wasn’t a clever or appropriate campaign. They were a paedophile group and at the end of the chain were little children’.’ Peter Saunders of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, said it was ‘more than alarming’ that anyone in the judiciary could be linked to PIE. Fulford, now 61, is the most senior public figure to be exposed as an apologist for paedophiles among Left-wing political groups of the 1970s and 1980s. He has enjoyed a stellar rise through the legal profession, becoming a QC in 1994 and a part-time judge the following year. In 2002 he became the first openly gay High Court judge, being nominated for a knighthood by Tony Blair, and in 2003 took up a prestigious role at the International Criminal Court in The Hague. Last year he was nominated as an Appeal Court judge by David Cameron and appointed to the Privy Council, the elite group of senior politicians, judges and clergy who advise the Queen on constitutional matters. Back in the late 1970s he was a newly qualified Left-wing barrister when he joined the NCCL, now known as Liberty, which had links to known paedophile groups and attempted to lower the age of consent to 14 and water down child pornography laws . Fulford’s involvement with the radical movement to legalise child sex goes even further than that of the Labour Ministers, documents uncovered by The Mail on Sunday show. He personally set up a group to support the ‘executive committee’ of PIE in the summer of 1979, after they had their homes raided by police. Images of child abuse and group literature were seized and five leaders, including chairman O’Carroll, were charged with the rare offence of ‘conspiracy to corrupt public morals’. Fulford and his colleagues called the organisation the Conspiracy Against Public Morals (CAPM), and it went on to distribute leaflets calling for the PIE ‘show trial’ to be dropped, and held protests outside courtrooms. In October 1979 Fulford wrote a full-page article in gay rights magazine Broadsheet, in which he was described as ‘the founder’ of the PIE support group. He claimed that classified adverts placed by PIE members, which led to the trial,  were ‘simply to enable paedophiles to make friends and offer each other mutual support’ rather than to contact children or exchange banned images. A leaflet distributed by CAPM and available through PIE’s mailing list went further, claiming: ‘This is a trumped-up charge designed to silence a group merely because it is unpopular with the guardians of public morality.’ And the prosecution was condemned as ‘an attack on PIE’s right to freedom of speech and freedom of association’. A longer briefing note put together by the CAPM called the paedophiles a ‘minority group ripe for bashing’ because they were open about their aims. In 1980, a Marxist collective used the almost identical name, Campaign Against Public Morals, and the same Central London PO Box address as Fulford’s group to publish a 60-page diatribe that called for the age of consent to be scrapped ‘for the liberation of children’. The revelations follow controversy over the roles of Labour grandees Patricia Hewitt, left, and Harriet Harman, who were all involved in the National Council for Civil Liberties when it counted paedophile activists among its members . Fulford successfully proposed a . motion at the August 1979 conference of an established gay rights group, . the Campaign for Homosexual Equality, that it should affiliate itself . to his new group and also call for the PIE leaders to be cleared. His actions were praised in the . paedophiles’ in-house journal, Magpie, which declared: ‘No longer alone – . new group to support PIE’ and said they ‘owed much to a speech by . barrister Adrian Fulford, which Gay News declared to be the best made at . the conference.’ The . following month the CAPM held its third meeting at which Fulford and . O’Carroll himself were present, as well as several members of the NCCL . gay rights committee. Minutes . of the gathering show that they discussed picketing the magistrates . court where the PIE defendants appeared and state ‘Adrian’ would ‘ask . Patricia Hewitt about the possibilities of using NCCL’s number to take . messages’. Probe: Labour MP Tom Watson said there should be a full investigation into the role of PIE . Records show PIE leader O’Carroll – who was jailed for two years in 1981 – was a member of the gay rights committee at the same time as Fulford. The paedophile group was often discussed at the gay rights committee’s meetings, and O’Carroll was given its support as he came under increasing public pressure. Last night, Fulford admitted he attended meetings of the NCCL gay rights committee when O’Carroll was there, but added that his presence ‘left me feeling extremely uncomfortable’. He added: ‘In the main, I provided some legal advice in the context of general civil liberties objections to the wide-ranging charge of conspiracy to corrupt public morals.’ And he stated that he has never wanted the age of consent to be lower than it is now. PIE folded in 1984 after the arrest of several more leading figures, including one – Steven Adrian  Smith – who had worked at the Home Office. Miss Hewitt, Miss Harman and Mr Dromey have now expressed regret for the paedophile activists involvement with the NCCL, while insisting they never condoned child sex and that PIE did not influence their policies. However archive material shows the NCCL’s Nettie Pollard actually invited PIE to become an affiliate group in 1975, offering them the chance to propose motions and take votes at its conferences. Last night, Fulford said: ‘On reflection, the NCCL gay rights committee should never have allowed members of PIE to attend any of its meetings and a clear separation should have been created with the two organisations.’","Lord Justice Fulford was named last year as an adviser to the Queen .

"[headerlink . Archeologists have been left scratching their heads after the unearthing of part of an ancient Egyptian sphinx in northern Israel. The find has prompted Egyptologists to speculate as to how the stone-carved mythical creature travelled so many miles from its original resting place. Some speculate that it may have been looted from the Egyptians thousands of years ago, while others suggest it was likely to have been given by Egypt as a gift to its neighbours. Scroll down for video . Baffling: Australian excavation volunteer Joshua Talbot displays the remains of a Sphinx with a hieroglyphic inscription between its paws dating circa 3rd century BC, found during excavation in the Northern Israeli archeological site of the ancient Tel Hazor . It has taken almost a year for the paws and forearms of the granite statue to be painstakingly restored, exposing hieroglyphic writing. The writing reveals that the sphinx was dedicated to Egyptian ruler Mycerinus, who ruled circa 2500 BC and was builder of the smaller of Giza's three great pyramids. It is the first statue ever to have been found that was created for the leader, and the first time an Egyptian statue has ever been found in the ancient Levant region - today's Israel, Lebanon and Syria. The writing also says: 'Beloved by the divine souls of Heliopolis.' Volunteers of the Hebrew University work during an excavation in the Northern Israeli archeological site of the ancient Tel Hazor, where they found the remains of a Sphinx with a hieroglyphic inscription . Archeologists have been left scratching their heads after finding the Egyptian sphinx with hieroglyphic inscription between its paws dating circa 3rd century BC at the Israeli dig . Egypt's magnificent Pyramids - one of the engineering marvels of all time - are situated at Giza just outside Cairo. The pyramids are generally believed to be tombs for the Pharaohs and/or a resurrection machine for the rulers' rebirth. The remarkable and baffling find was stumbled upon by archeologists working in the Tel Hazor dig site, in Israel's Galilee in August 2012. But only now having carefully removed the incrustation, are they able to clearly see the inscriptions. Amnon Ben-Tor, an archaeology professor at the Hebrew University in charge of the Tel Hazor dig, told AFP that the sphinx would have originally been placed by the temple of Mycerinus. His is the smallest of the three great pyramids at Giza, Cairo. Tel Hazor was the capital of southern Canaan, founded circa 2,700 BC and at its peak covering approximately 200 acres and home to some 20,000 Canaanites. It was destroyed in the 13th century BC . So far, only parts of the feet and the face have been retrieved, but archaeologists hope to find more of the sphinx as they continue the dig. Mr Ben-Tor believes the sphinx was brought to Tel Hazor 3,000 years ago, either as war booty or as a gift to the then ruler of Hazor by an ancient Egyptian king. He said: 'That it arrived in the days of Mycerinus himself is unlikely, since there were absolutely no relations between Egypt and this part of the world then. 'Egypt maintained relations with Lebanon, especially via the ancient port of Byblos, to import cedar wood via the Mediterranean, so they skipped' today's northern Israel, he said. Another option is that the statue was part of the plunders of the Canaanites, who in the late 17th and early 16th century BC ruled lower Egypt, the expert said. 'Egyptian records tell us that those . foreign rulers... plundered and desecrated the local temples and did all . kinds of terrible things, and it is possible that some of this looting . included a statue like this one.' But to Ben-Tor the most likely way the sphinx reached Tel Hazor is in the form of a gift sent by a later Egyptian ruler. The small sphinx is believed to be the only one found from the pyramid of Myrcerinus - the smallest of Giza's great pyramids . The most distinctive feature of Khafre's Pyramid, in the background, is the topmost layer of smooth stones that are the only remaining casing stones on a Giza Pyramid . Giza's three great pyramids, built for the fourth dynasty kings Khufu, Khafre and Menkaure, also known as Mycerinus, who ruled from 2589-2504 BC . 'The third option is that it arrived in Hazor some time after the New Kingdom started in 1,550 BC, during which Egypt ruled Canaan, and maintained close relations with the local rulers, who were left on their thrones,' he said. 'In such a case it's possible the statue was sent by the Egyptian ruler to king of Hazor, the most important ruler in this region.' Ben-Dor said the statue was most likely deliberately broken by new occupiers at Tel Hazor in an act of defiance to the old rule. Finding the sphinx was 'unexpected,' said Ben-Tor, 'but fits' archaeological facts and findings. 'When you're in a bank, you find money,' he said. Shlomit Blecher, who manages the Selz Foundation Hazor Excavations, was the archaeologist who unearthed the finding in August 2012. 'It was the last hour of the last day of the dig,' she told AFP of the moment of the find. 'We all leapt with joy and happiness, everyone was thrilled.' 'We hope the other pieces are here and that we find them in the near days,' she said. The first and great pyramids at Giza was constructed by Khufu (also known as Cheops) the son of Sneferu. Khufu ruled around 2589-2566 when the Old Kingdom of Egypt was nearing its peak of prosperity and could afford to build the vast structures. Constructed of 2,300,000 blocks limestone and granite blocks, the total weight is 6.5 million tonnes. The whole structure reached 140 metres in height and had a base length originally of 230 metres. It is believed that the stone blocks were hauled up sloping ramps, lubricated by water, using manpower. The outer white face of the pyramid was finished with soother and polished limestone. Inside the pyramid are a number of chambers and passages. The burial chamber is almost six meters tall, and was built by solid blocks of granite to prevent penetration. It is believed that construction took 20 years. The original entrance to the great pyramid is on the North face, 15m high; the modern entrance is located several metres down and was forced in the 9th century. The other two pyramids were constructed by Menkaure (also known as Mycerinus), which is the smallest, and Khafre’s (who is also known as Chephren). Khafre’s  pyramid looks higher than Khufu’s but it is actually half a metre smaller but built on higher ground. The most distinctive feature of Khafre's Pyramid is the topmost layer of smooth stones that are the only remaining casing stones on a Giza Pyramid. Some believe that the Sphinx has the face of Khafre. Others argue that it was Khufu, and that it was part of Khufu’s pyramid complex. And others believe that it was there before Khufu built his pyramid. Due to the vast expense, the end of the Old Kingdom and the movement of the capital to Thebes, modern day Luxor, the Pharaohs started to be buried in tombs cut out of the rock in the Valley of the King and the construction of pyramids ceased.","Sphinx feet, forearms and hieroglyphics found at dig site in northern Israel .

"‘If I hadn’t fallen pregnant the brain tumours would have carried on growing,' said Mel Hennessy . Recovering in hospital the day after giving birth to her daughter, Mel Hennessy was suddenly crippled by an excruciating headache. ‘I’ve never known pain like it,’ says the 43-year-old former beauty therapy tutor from Redcar, North Yorkshire. ‘It was in my eyeballs and eye sockets. 'I couldn’t stop trembling — I couldn’t even hold my baby, Daisy.’ At first, Mel put her symptoms down to side-effects from the Caesarean anaesthetic. But four days after the birth, in September 2009, the left side of her face was paralysed, too. Mel’s GP diagnosed Bell’s palsy, where the facial nerve becomes inflamed after a viral infection, and prescribed steroids. Two weeks later, the paralysis had gone, but the pain had returned. ‘I had toothache, headaches, eye ache,’ says Mel, who is married to Wayne, 45, a pipe fitter. ‘I was exhausted and could barely look after Daisy. Then I began losing the sight in my left eye.’ Mel was referred for CT scans, which revealed two brain tumours — one so huge it stretched from behind her left ear to the bottom of her jaw and then down her spine. ‘A hospital oncologist later said it was like an octopus wrapped around everything — it was the largest brain tumour he’d seen,’ says Mel. The second tumour was smaller and on the right-hand side of her face. Doctors believe the tumours had been there for ten years and hormones produced during Mel’s pregnancy with Daisy had caused them to grow aggressively, pressing on nerves that resulted in her symptoms. ‘If I hadn’t fallen pregnant the brain tumours would have carried on growing, but much more slowly until it was too late,’ says Mel. ‘Daisy saved my life.’ Mel is one of the 14,000 Britons diagnosed with brain tumours every year. The recent case of Ashya King, the five-year-old whose parents were arrested in Spain after removing him from Southampton General Hospital, has thrown a spotlight on this Cinderella cancer. The Kings wanted their son to undergo proton beam therapy, a more sophisticated form of radiotherapy. However, the NHS will not always fund the treatment for brain tumours and even if it does, patients have to travel overseas to get it. Scroll down for video . Recovering in hospital the day after giving birth to her daughter, Mel was suddenly crippled by an excruciating headache. ‘I’ve never known pain like it,’ she said . Nine people die from brain tumours every day in England and Wales — they are the biggest cancer killer of children and under-40s in Britain. Yet brain tumours receive 1 per cent of the money spent on cancer research. A report from Cancer Research UK found that while half of patients diagnosed with all types of cancer survive for at least ten years, this drops to 13 per cent for brain tumour patients. Indeed, survival rates for brain cancer increased by only 7 per cent between 1970 and 2014, while the majority of other cancer survival rates soared. Part of the problem is that it can take months, even years, to be diagnosed because many GPs are poorly informed about brain cancer, says Sue Farrington Smith, chief executive of the charity Brain Tumour Research. ‘The speed and quality of brain tumour diagnosis is patchy across the country. This is a reflection of the lack of investment and awareness about this disease. ‘Diagnosis is often delayed because GPs and A&E teams may not request scans early enough or scans showing abnormalities may not be referred promptly to a specialist neuroscience team.’ 'I couldn’t stop trembling — I couldn’t even hold my baby, Daisy,' said Mel . And many symptoms, such as headaches, nausea, vomiting and difficulty in walking, can be attributed to other causes, such as migraines or stress. Furthermore, as there are more than 120 different types of brain tumours, their location and behaviour mean symptoms can vary, as can treatment. The number of sufferers may be nearly three times as high as the statistics indicate, says Geoff Pilkington, who leads the Brain Tumour Research flagship centre at the University of Portsmouth. ‘Until recently, statistics included only those with primary brain tumours — those originating in the tissue of the brain. 'However, there are other types of brain tumour.’ These include secondary cancers from other parts of the body spreading to the brain, tumours growing on the brain membrane and those growing on the cranial nerve. ‘If these are taken into account, 14,000 cases a year becomes more like 40,000.’ And unusually, compared with other cancers, cases are increasing. In 2012, there were 23 per cent more men diagnosed as suffering from brain tumours than in 1970 and 25 per cent more women. One explanation is better diagnosis, thanks to increased awareness and improved diagnostic tools, says Professor Pilkington. Lifestyle factors — such as mobile phone use, chemicals and exposure to radiation — could be contributing factors. The largest number of brain tumours in adults are due to secondary cancers spreading to the brain via the bloodstream — particularly from breast, lung and skin cancers (the structure of these cancer cells enables them to stick to the blood vessels in the brain in a way other cancer cells do not). ‘I had to learn to walk again and it affected my speech. My husband Wayne had to wash and feed me. In the end, things were so bad I had to live with my mother-in-law for four months,' said Mel . Between 20 and 40 per cent of all cancers spread to the brain, says Kevin O’Neill, consultant neurosurgeon at Imperial College Healthcare Trust. Treatment options include surgery (location and tumour type permitting), radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Proton beam therapy is a more targeted form of radiotherapy and is thought to be less harmful to healthy brain tissue, though some experts question this. Meanwhile, some chemotherapy drugs are ‘no use’ in brain tumours ‘because the blood/brain barrier that prevents toxins reaching the brain stops some drugs getting through,’ says Dr O’Neill. Blood vessels are more tightly packed together in the brain, and are bound by proteins and special cells, meaning only fat-soluble substances (most chemotherapy drugs are water-soluble) get through. Thanks to fundraising and sponsorship, £20 million is to be invested in new centres for brain cancer research: two in London — at Queen Mary University and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust — and one in Plymouth. Seven centres are planned. ‘I still get a lot of pain in my head, eyes and teeth,’ said Mel . Mel’s tumours were found to be a meningioma, a relatively common tumour originating in the meninges, the membranes surrounding the brain. It can usually be removed with surgery as it rarely penetrates brain tissue. However, the largest tumour had grown aggressively, fuelled by pregnancy hormones. Its size and the fact it had grown around delicate brain structures and important blood vessels made it difficult to fully remove without risking brain injury or paralysis. In March 2010, Mel underwent surgery to remove 30 per cent of the largest tumour — the part surrounding her left eye — followed by radiotherapy. ‘I was told there was a chance I wouldn’t survive surgery or I’d be paralysed afterwards,’ says Mel. Fortunately, she was unscathed. However, she says: ‘I went through hell.’ ‘I had to learn to walk again and it affected my speech. My husband Wayne had to wash and feed me. 'In the end, things were so bad I had to live with my mother-in-law for four months, so she could look after me and the baby as Wayne had to work.’ The sight in her left eye could not be saved, because the tumour had damaged the optic nerve. ‘I still get a lot of pain in my head, eyes and teeth,’ says Mel, who has MRI scans every eight months and is too exhausted to return to work. ‘I’m weak and need to sleep several hours a day. I need a childminder to help look after Daisy.’ The tumours have stopped growing (the smaller one did not require surgery), but she may need another operation if that changes. ‘Despite it all, I’m hugely positive — and you never know what scientific breakthroughs may be around the corner.’ Brain Tumour Research braintumourresearch.org.

"When French actor Gerard Depardieu surprised locals by popping in for a dram at a small pub on the Isle of Skye, not everyone was toasting his health. While Depardieu was pictured enjoying the range of local whiskies and beer at the Am Oraban Bar on the Sleat peninsula, the Edinburgh International Film Festival was expecting him at a red carpet screening of his new movie hours later. However, Depardieu mysteriously failed to depart for Edinburgh and disappointed organisers were forced to announce that their star attraction had pulled out at the last moment. A votre sante: Gerard Depardieu pours himself a glass of Skye Gold beer in a Skye pub, hours before he was due to attend a red carpet film screening at the Edinburgh International Film Festival . Social media sites were immediately rife with speculation as to what may have befallen the veteran of 170 films, who at 65 still enjoys something of a reputation as a hellraiser. One tweeted: 'Gerard Depardieu was in a Skye pub last night bid didn't make it to @edfilmfest tonight. Wonder why?' The star of Green Card and Cyrano de Bergerac pulled out shortly after being pictured during a visit to the Am Praban Bar at the Hotel Eilean Iarmain on Friday night. Pictures on social media show Depardieu sampling beer, whisky, haggis and bagpipes while filming a French TV series on Scottish food and drink. A posting on the Sleat, Perfectly Skye Facebook page, said Depardieu 'clearly enjoyed tasting the range of Gaelic whiskies' and tried 'haggis, washed down with a dram and a pint of Skye Gold from the Isle of Skye Brewery.' The posting added: 'The arrival of a ten-strong photography and support team was a surprise to visitors and locals enjoying an early evening drink and many of those had their photographs taken with the iconic actor. Bon appetit: The French actor can't resist sampling some haggis at the Am Praban Bar at the Hotel Eilean Iarmain on Friday night . 'Great news for Sleat, with the film crew choosing to enjoy our fabulous hotels, food and drink.' The following night, Depardieu was due to appear as a guest of honour at the UK premiere of his film Welcome To New York. The raunchy drama about an international financier with 'monstrous sexual appetites' has been enthusiastically trailed by the film festival on its website. But at 1.30pm on Sunday, the festival posted a notice stating: 'It is with regret that we have to announce that Gerard Depardieu has cancelled his appearance this evening.' A spokesman said organisers had been given no further details as to why the actor had pulled out, but added: 'He has let the festival down very badly.' The spokesman added that the festival was aware of photos posted on Facebook of their star attraction pouring himself a pint, but added: 'We won't be pursuing this any further because the screening has already taken place - but there is some annoyance here over his failure to attend.' Bonjour, mon ami: Depardieu meets locals as he films a French TV cooking programme on the Isle of Skye . Depardieu, who has described himself as 'someone who is a bit of a rebel, who shakes things up and who is sometimes drunk', was not available for comment. The veteran actor, who also runs a successful parallel career as a wine-grower, has long been known for his drink-fuelled excesses and unpredictable behaviour. In 2011, he was thrown off a plane from Paris to Dublin after relieving himself in the aisle in full view of other passengers. In an interview on US television he later protested: 'I'm not a monster. I'm just a man who wants to pee.' Asked if he was drunk at the time, and if there was 'any wine involved,' the actor replied: 'No'. Last year he was banned from driving for six months and fined 4,000 euros (£3,204) after he fell off his scooter in Paris and was arrested for driving while intoxicated. In January, the actor was reported to police for allegedly hurling buckets of water on customers in a bar beneath his holiday home in the southern Italian city of Lecce. He is said to have lost his temper in a row over noise. The following night, Depardieu, who took Russian citizenship in protest at proposed French tax rates of 75 per cent, poured water over drinkers, the Quotidiano Puglia newspaper reported.","Gerard Depardieu suprised locals by popping in for a dram at a pub on Skye .

"Alex Lewis lost both legs and arms to a Strep A infection, which triggered septicaemia and toxic shock syndrome . A father-of-one is today relearning to walk after losing all four limbs to a  flesh eating bug. This time last year Alex Lewis was fighting for his life, after a common cold triggered a strep A infection, septicaemia and toxic shock syndrome. He lost both arms and legs, as well as his lips. But today, for the first time since he was robbed of the ability to walk, the 34-year-old is standing for himself and has taken his first steps unaided. He is starting his long road to recovery on shorter artificial limbs, but hopes to walk down the aisle with his partner Lucy Townsend next summer. He aims to stand at the alter on full-size prosthetics as the couple tie the knot. Mr Lewis shocked the mother of his son when he proposed, despite years of telling Miss Townsend he never wanted marry. But in the face of a life-changing year Mr Lewis said he wants nothing more than to make the mother of his three-year-old son, Sam, his wife. 'It was because of everything that has happened throughout the year,' he said. 'She has been my constant support, she has raised my son, she has been incredible. I could think of no better reason to ask her.' Miss Townsend said she had put thoughts of a wedding aside whilst supporting Alex on his road to recovery. The couple joke how Mr Lewis's constant refusal to tie the knot before his illness struck - even betting his mum £100 he never would - formed the basis of a test by doctors to see whether he was brain damaged as a result of the illness. Miss Townsend, 41, said: 'We had to ask Alex a question that we were sure he would know, so I said to ask him whether he would marry me - and his immediate answer was no! We knew straight away then that he was fine.' She said she was stunned when he asked her and described how their relationship had not changed. 'I am not his nurse, I don't think I would make a very good one! He has his nurse, who is fantastic, to help him and he really works a lot of things out for himself,' Miss Townsend said. 'We are here for him as his family.' The couple plan get married in France next year. By then Mr Lewis, 34, is aiming to be up on full-sized prosthetic limbs in order to stand side by side with his bride as they say their vows. 'She tells me that she won't marry anyone shorter than her so I have got to be up on prosthetic limbs for that reason alone,' he said. He also described how the proposal wasn't overly romantic, adding: 'If I had tried to get down on one knee, I wouldn't have got up again.' The father-of-one, from Hampshire, was struck by the infection last November after suffering a common cold . He is relearning how to walk, using short prosthetics, but aims to be on full-size artificial limbs to walk down the aisle to marry his fiance and the mother of his son Sam, right, Lucy Townsend, left, next summer . It is that humour which has helped the family get through some of the darkest days since Alex became a quadruple amputee. He lost three limbs, part of his nose and his lips when the normally harmless bacterial infection Group A Streptococcus, rapidly developed into multiple organ failure, septicaemia and toxic shock syndrome. When pioneering surgery to try and save his remaining arm failed, the father-of-one was admitted to hospital in June for an emergency amputation. As well as learning to walk again Mr Lewis is undergoing facial reconstruction, which will continue next year with four more operations planned. He said: 'Even thing like opening the door has to be approached in a whole new way. When you rely on mechanics you have to approach things in a completely different way. 'It has been challenging but I don't think there is anything I can't do that I want to now.' Now he is walking for himself Alex plans to take the family dog Holly and do some Christmas shopping. And he hopes he will one day be able to chase Sam around in the garden of their Southampton home. He knows he faces a long road to full recovery, but he said it is all about setting goals and reaching them. 'You have to see yourself doing it and get there,' Mr Lewis said. As well as relearning how to walk, Mr Lewis is also facing a series of operations to rebuild his lips . 'I had thought about how it would feel when I walked for myself for the first time and when it actually happened it wasn't as emotional as I thought, and had been told it would be. It just felt normal, like this is how it is supposed to be.' Talking about how he felt on the first anniversary of when his life was irrevocably changed a year ago this month, he said: 'It was more Lucy, mum and dad and the rest of my friends and family I felt regret for. I was pretty much out of it. For them, they were living it.' Mr Lewis spent that day working on the Alex Lewis Trust - a charity he and Miss Townsend set up - before going out with friends in the evening where they raised a glass of champagne. 'It wasn't in celebration or commiseration, just an acknowledgment really of what happened a year ago,' he added. 'That date will always be significant to me. That is my New Year, that is where it all started again for me.' Since setting up the Alex Lewis Trust which aims to raise money to help pay for Alex's rehabilitation and for the hospital where he was treated, around £180,000 poured in. Mr Lewis, said: 'I am continually amazed with the public support. It has been incredible. What people are doing to raise money is just amazing, I can't thank them enough.'","Alex Lewis 34, thought he had caught a cold when he fell ill last November .

"Prescriptions for ‘chemical cosh’ drugs to treat hyperactivity have risen almost nine-fold, with claims that children as young as three are taking them. The number of drugs prescriptions to treat Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder has leapt from 92,100 in 1997 to 786,400 last year, say NHS figures. It is feared that youngsters are being given them instead of more expensive counselling and other treatments. Some parents are also believed to be pressurising GPs for drugs to help boost performance at school. Epidemic: Ritalin is now being prescribed to young children as parents worry about their behaviour in school . Psychologists yesterday demanded tougher regulations and a significant reduction in the prescription of psychotropic drugs, including Ritalin. Health guidelines say they should not be given to children under six. Symptoms of ADHD include an inability to concentrate and restless or impulsive behaviour. Experts claim that cuts in funding for recommended treatment, including counselling, are leading to increased prescriptions. The British Psychological Society’s division of educational and child psychology yesterday held a one-day summit in Manchester to discuss rising concerns about the ‘medicalisation of childhood’. Ritalin – or methylphenidate hydrochloride – is among a number of so-called ‘chemical coshes’ used to treat ADHD. It can cause nausea, fatigue and mood swings and has been linked to suicides. Medication: There are fears that doctors are prescribing drugs because they are easier than other treatments . National guidelines in England and Wales say children with ADHD should receive ‘comprehensive’ treatment, including psychological, behavioural and educational help. But Vivian Hill, chairman of the BPS’s medicalisation of childhood working group, said that this did not always happen. ‘Budgets have been cut and psychiatrists feel they can’t follow the official guidelines, which recommend therapy before drugs. ‘Often, the first response now is to issue drugs, not offer therapeutic help.’ Sbe estimates ‘hundreds’ of children under six, some as young as three, are being given drugs, which might have little impact without other therapy. A study last year by the Association of Educational Psychologists found more than 100 children under six on Ritalin in the West Midlands – a trend ‘reaffirmed’ nationwide. A spokesman for the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, which advises the NHS on treatment, said drugs have a role to play, but psychotherapy is central to managing ADHD. He added: ‘These drugs are not recommended as first-line treatments for young people with mild or moderate ADHD. They are recommended as first-line therapy for school-age children and young people with severe ADHD.’ Barbara Sahakian, a professor of clinical neuropsychology at Cambridge University, said last night: ‘I have had psychiatrists tell me that sometimes they don’t feel that the child is sufficiently severe [enough] for requiring a drug treatment and they think psychological treatment might be sufficient. ‘But the parents are quite keen they should have a drug. Parents know these drugs are cognitive enhancing, so I guess they’re trying to get an advantage for the child.’","Nearly 800,000 children were given ADHD medication last year, says the NHS .

"From grappling with a smartphone to using social media, for some people, technological advances can be a headache. But one man has embraced a lot of them and uses 700 systems at once to monitor his every move and mood. Chris Dancy, who is accepted to be ‘the most quantified human’ in the world, uses a range of sensors, devices, services and applications to gather real-time data about his body and the environment around him. Scroll down for video . Chris Dancy (pictured) is accepted to be 'the most quantified human' and uses sensors, devices, services and applications to give him real-time data about his body and the environment around him. The patches on his neck and wires coming out of his arms are not real and are intended to represent his 'connectivity' Chris Dancy, 45, uses a range of sensors, devices, services and applications to gather real-time data about his body and the environment around him. These include a Pebble smartwatch, Google Glass, a BodyMedia armband and Blue heart rate monitor. He collects data about what he eats, when he sleeps, how he uses his email, his health, travel plans and photos and even his dogs' levels of activity. Collecting data about his eating habits and fitness has enabled Mr Dancy to lose 100lbs (45kg) in weight. His home is also hooked up with gadgets, including a smart lighting system and a mattress cover that collects data in his sleep. He has been monitoring and collecting his personal data for five years, adding two or three systems every week. His connected lifestyle means he knows himself better than anyone and all this monitoring has even allowed him to lose 100lbs (45kg) by tracking how much he moves and eats. Mr Dancy, 45 from Denver, said: ‘When I touch something, I try to make sure it’s a something that I can get information out of so I can track, then search it, visualise it and share it with people who might want that piece of it. ‘I know now what to drink, what to eat, when to sleep and when to actually make myself get up. Very simple things like that. ‘It’s body and mind hacking. Just like we . hack computers and any type of data, your body and your mind is the . greatest information system humanity has ever known and understanding it . makes it hackable.’ Mr Dancy describes his lifestyle as 'body and mind hacking' and believes that the mind is greatest information system humanity has ever known and that understanding it makes it hackable. Here is a screenshot of his Google calender, which is a hub for readings from his various wearable devices and other collected data . Mr Dancy has a plethora of wearable technology on his person at all times, including a Pebble smartwatch and Google Glass to a BodyMedia armband and Blue heart rate monitor. His home is also hooked up with numerous sensors for products such as the smartphone-controlled Hue lighting system and a Beddit mattress cover, which collects data on his sleep. The dedicated technophile also tracks the progress of his two dogs by collecting data on their daily activities via pet GPS system, Tagg.

The dedicated technophile also tracks the progress of his two dogs (pictured) by collecting data on their daily activities via pet GPS system, Tagg . Explaining how he adopted his futuristic lifestyle, he said: ‘I realised I was putting a lot of information online and if one of these services went out of business, I would have been without a lot of information that was relevant, at least to me at that time. ‘It really started with me having a desire to digitally collect what I was creating. I just spent the last five years bringing on two to three systems a week.’ Mr Dancy collects and uses the data to his advantage and by tracking his eating and fitness habits he has seen a huge benefit to his health, including weight loss. Mr Dancy's data obsession started when he wanted to digitally collect what he was creating and in the last five years he has added a system a week. Here are some of the subjects he collects data on, including: health, work, content and money . Mr Dancy thinks that people don't understand the value of their information or they don't want to learn how to use it. Here is a graph showing his mood over a week . He is surprised that others have not followed him in collecting data to track their lives in the same way. ‘I have had a lot of people tell me they want to do it or they are working on it but it has been two-and-a half-years since people starting learning about me and no one has really done it. I don’t know what the hold up is as to me it is very easy to do. ‘Either they don’t understand the value of the information or it is just something hard for them to break,’ he said. Chris has now become a sought after individual for both major companies and start-ups who hope he can help them to develop smarter products. ‘I have had everybody from people who wanted to make smart cups to people who want to make underwear to major beverage companies and sportswear companies,’ he said. He is surprised that others have not followed him in collecting data to track their lives in the same way. These maps show photos taken in cities that Mr Dancy has visited in recent times . ‘I don’t want to name drop but almost every big company and a lot of start-ups have reached out to me.

"The last time a divided U.S. Congress passed a budget deal, President Ronald Reagan was denying he traded arms for Iranian hostages and the Space Shuttle Challenger explosion was fresh in Americans' minds. But a House Republican and a Democratic senator hope they've found a compromise that federal legislators can live with. Washington state Democrat Patty Murray and Wisconsin Republican Paul Ryan announced a proposal late on Tuesday that Ryan said focuses 'on where the common ground is' between America's two political parties, a deal that would balance the federal budget ten years from now and sidestep the threat of government shutdowns in January and October 2014. Future Congresses could undo the terms of the arrangement, and the current Congress has yet to see the plan or consider it, however. And conservative groups are working overtime to kill the deal while it's still in the crib. 'Compromise has been a dirty word' in Washington, D.C., Murray complained in an evening news conference. but 'we have broken through the partisanship and the gridlock.' The two promised the details of their agreement would be available online by late Tuesday night. Scroll down for video . Grand bargain: House Budget Committee Chairman Rep. Paul Ryan and Senate Budget Committee Chair Patty Murray unveiled a bipartisan budget deal whose main foe will be members of Congress on Ryan's right . President Barack Obama, en route home from Africa, offered a statement praising the deal. While it contains no new taxes, Obama said some new government 'fees' will be baked into the cake . But their initial outline calls for $85 billion in total budget savings and $63 billion in 'sequester relief, reducing the annual deficit by $23 billion. That includes $45 billion of targeted cuts in 2014. President Barack Obama said in a statement that he wants members of Congress from both parties 'to take the next step and actually pass a budget based on this agreement so I can sign it into law and our economy can continue growing and creating jobs without more Washington headwinds.' 'I think conservatives should vote for it,' Ryan said, despite rumblings from the political right that the negotiated budget settlement still spends too much taxpayer money . He praised the Ryan–Murray deal as 'balanced, and includes targeted fee increases and spending cuts designed in a way that doesn’t hurt our economy or break the ironclad promises we’ve made to our seniors.' His use of the word 'fees,' not 'taxes,' agrees with Ryan's insistence that 'there are no tax increases here.' But Murray cautioned in the joint press conference that the so-called 'sequester' budget cuts instituted early in 2013 'shouldn't be replaced with spending cuts alone.' SHe, too, said the agreement would 'roll back sequestration’s cuts to defense and domestic investments in a ""balanced"" way.' 'This isn't the plan I would have written on my own,' she acknowledged, and 'I'm pretty sure Chairman Ryan wouldn't have written it on his own.' But the compromise, both insisted, would be good for the future of the U.S. Ryan took a poke at the Democrat-run Senate, saying that his ideal budget could never become law in the current Congress . But the resulting legislation, he said, 'reduces the deficit by $23 billion, it does not raise taxes, and it cuts spending in a smarter way, . 'I see this agreement as a step in the right direction.' Conservatives both inside and outside of Congress began carping as soon as news emerged Tuesday morning that a budget bargain was in the works, guessing that it wouldn't likely include enough spending cuts to satisfy them. Alabama Republican Jeff Sessions, the ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, warned Time magazine that 'the deal is not going to be what mainstream Republicans hoped for. 'It'll probably turn out to be a very tough call for a lot of people who want to have an agreement but also want to see progress made in certain areas,' Sessions said. 'I don’t think a deal has to be reached if it's not a good deal.' 'There is a lot more for Congress to do,' Murray warned, signaling that immigration reform will be next on the Senate's agenda after the New Year . Allies of Sessions and other lawmakers to the right of the GOP's center went on the offensive eary in the day. FreedomWorks, a tea party-linked organization known for anti-tax and smaller-government positions, said it would oppose the deal 'in its current reported form.' The libertarian CATO Institute also voiced disapproval, as did Heritage Action for America, the conservative Heritage Foundation's grassroots organizing and political-pressure arm. 'Heritage Action cannot support a budget deal that would increase spending in the near-term for promises of woefully inadequate long-term reductions,' the group said on Monday. 'A gimmicky, spend-now-cut-later deal will take our nation in the wrong direction.' The group's communications director, Dan Holler, told MailOnline that his group will wait to render a final opinion until the terms of the deal are made public. Americans for Prosperity, another conservative group, agreed after the press conference that it would press hard for 'no' votes and argue for continuing the sequester cuts. 'This budget compromise is not just bad policy, it is bad politics,' said Tim Phillips,' the group's president, in a statement. 'This is about protecting the pocketbook of average Americans, not about shutting down the government or refusing to compromise. Lawmakers should simply continue an existing, bi-partisan agreement that has already reduced overspending and has not compromising our modest economic recovery.' 'Spending levels were set by law at $967 billion. Exceeding those levels by $45 billion takes us in the wrong direction,' Phillips said. Ryan and Murray have spent weeks hammering out the deal since October's partial government shutdown came to a close . But Ryan fended off journalists' questions about whether House conservatives would embrace the product of a weeks-long negotiation that could evaporate if enough tea partiers refuse to play ball with House moderates. House Speaker John Boehner will have a hard time advancing the agreement to a floor vote if he can't get assent from a majority of Republlcans, in the tradition of an informal rule put in place by former speaker Dennis Hastert. 'I think conservatives should vote for it,' Ryan said, predicting that the House will pass the bill. The deal, he explained, focuses on 'providing some sequester relief for 2014 and 2015, and paying for that with spending reforms ... that, to me, is a good deal. The federal government will still spend $1.012 trillion in 2014 and $1.014 trillion in 2015.under the terms of the deal, but Ryan predicted that right-wing GOP members would take a long view . 'The budget number that we fought for in the last session [in 2011–2012] won't be hit until  the year 2017 under this agreement,' he said. And Congress, he added, will 'start to make real reform to these auto-pilot programs that are the drivers of our debt in the first place.' Herding cats: House Speaker John Boehner will have his hands full Wednesday morning when tea party-aligned conservatives in his caucus are expected to pledge their opposition to Ryan's bargain with Democrats . Murray lamented the deal's lack of action on 'closing corporate tax loopholes,' but said Democrats will warm to the fact that it includes no changes to Social Security or Medicare.' And 'there is a lot more for Congress to do,' she said. ''We know we need comprehensive tax reform. We need comprehensive immigration reform.' And Congress, Murray hoped, will 'show that we can do something without a crisis right around the corner.' House Republican leaders are itching to finish their legislative year by Friday, but Senate Democrats have signaled that they plan to meet next week. That could put the GOP in a tough position if the Senate votes to pass an amended version of the Ryan–Murray proposal, since they would have to choose between gaveling back into session or enduring an extended holiday break while risking being labeled as obstructionists. The House Republican Caucus will meet at 9:00 a.m. on Wednesday to discuss next steps.","Conservative groups want to stick with the 'sequester' budget cuts instead of spending more in a deal with Democrats .

"A chemical that has been linked to cancer cell growth is being used by millions of Americans in toothpaste every day, it has emerged. The company behind Colgate Total insists that triclosan, which it uses to stave off gum disease, is safe to use because the toothpaste was approved in 1997 by the Food and Drug Administration. But the toxicology documents used by the FDA to approve the toothpaste were only released early this year after a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit last year - and reveal the agency relied upon company-backed science to reach its conclusion, Bloomberg News reported. The 35-page report reveals the FDA had concerns that triclosan could increase the risk of cancer - but Colgate said the chemical was only problematic in large doses. Scroll down for video . Concerns: Colgate Total toothpaste, pictured, contains a chemical called triclosan, which it uses to stave off gum disease - but studies have suggested it could harm animal growth . Healthy or harmful?: A chemical that has been linked to cancer cell growth is being used by millions of Americans in toothpaste every day . But evidence available at the time, as well as newer studies, show there are indeed concerns with the chemical - including premature births and underdeveloped bones in animals. 'The recently released pages, taken . alongside new research on triclosan, raise questions about whether the . agency did appropriate due diligence in approving Total 17 years ago,' scientists told Bloomberg. In 2010, a student linked triclosan, which has commonly been used to reduce bacteria contamination, to reduced fertility in mice and a 2013 study linked it to lowered sperm production in rats. And a study from 2003 found triclosan in the urine of 75 per cent of 2,517 Americans - including children - who were tested by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Total lairs: The company behind Colgate Total insists that the ingredient triclosan was approved by the FDA but it has emerged that the agency relied upon company-backed science to reach its conclusion . Despite evidence - including pages in the report showing how tests found fetal bone malformations in mice and rats - Colgate deemed the results irrelevant because they were conducted on animals. 'We have created a system . where we are testing these chemicals out on the human population,' scientist Thomas Zoeller told Bloomberg. 'I . love the idea they are all safe. But when we have . studies on animals that suggest otherwise, I think we're taking a huge . risk.' Dr Thomas Zoeller . Still, Colgate said that the 35 pages . do not prove the chemical is harmful to humans and said that its safety . is proved by more than 80 clinical studies of 19,000 people. 'In the nearly 18 years that Colgate . Total has been on the market in the U.S., there has been no signal of a . safety issue from adverse-event reports,' spokesman Thomas DiPiazza told Bloomberg. He added that, while the FDA had been worried about the chemical's carcinogenicity, a study in 1997 found it did not pose a cancer risk for humans. Colgate said it has no plans to reformulate Total toothpaste. The FDA said on its website that triclosan is 'not known' to be dangerous to humans - but the results found in animals has given them enough of a reason to run tests again. Drug regulators are now reviewing the dangers of the chemical, but they will only re-visit the approval of Total if they find a great enough reason to. In a sign of the concern over the chemical, Minnesota lawmakers banned the chemical in May. Avon and Johnson & Johnson have also announced plans to cut the chemical from its products. In 2010, the European Union banned triclosan in materials that come into contact with food.","Colgate Total contains triclosan, which has been linked to cancer and growth malformations in animals .

"Algae-like structures found inside fragments of a meteorite which struck Sri Lanka last year prove that life exists elsewhere in the Universe, a new study claims. A paper by an international team of scientists, their second on the subject, makes the extraordinary claim that electron microscope images of the rocks have revealed tiny fossilised life forms from outer space. The authors are convinced that their findings offer firm evidence of panspermia, the hypothesis that life exists throughout the Universe and is spread by meteoroids, asteroids and planetoids. From outer space? This electron microscope image . of a meteor fragment shows a  microfossil of extraterrestrial origin, a study claims . The microorganism that fell to Earth: This . picture shows a close up of the point marked (b) in the image above: The paper claims that the rock in which these were found came from a . meteor which landed in Sri Lanka . Undeniably organic? The paper reiterates claims first made in January in an earlier study led by controversial scientist Chandra Wickramasinghe . However, sceptics are already lining up to pour scorn on their methodology. MailOnline first reported in January the claims by Professor Chandra Wickramasinghe, of the Buckingham Centre for Astrobiology, that investigations of the meteorite had revealed evidence of alien life. He is joint author of a new study, just published in the Journal of Cosmology, which reiterates the controversial claims on the basis of a new analysis of the rocks. The paper tells how on the evening of December 29 last year a bright yellow fireball lit up the skies over Polonnaruwa, Sri Lanka, turning green as it disintegrated on entry into the Earth's atmosphere. Blazing hot, sparkling fragments rained down on the villages and paddy fields below, according to reports, leaving some witnesses with burns and giving off fumes with a strong odour of asphalt. Local police collected samples of the curious rocks and handed them to the Medical Research Institute of the Sri Lankan Ministry of Health, who then passed them on to researchers at Cardiff University for further analysis, the study says. In total Jamie Wallis, of Cardiff's School of Mathematics, and colleagues received 628 fragments purportedly from the meteorite - three of which, they say, were 'clearly identified as possible meteorites'. In the latest study, the researchers make the extraordinary claim than these three rocks contain fossilised biological structures fused into the rock matrix. Furthermore, they say, their tests have ruled out the possibility of terrestrial contamination. The team published electron microscope images of structures within the stones which they say show a complex, thick-walled, carbon-rich microfossil about 100 micrometres across. Another image, they say, shows well-preserved flagella 100 micrometres long but only two micrometres in diameter. Claims: Professor Chandra Wickramasinghe with the fragment of space rock in which the fossils were found . Evidence for ET? Critics say that even if the rock was indeed from outer space, research into it has failed to prove that the traces of life apparently found are not the result of contamination here on Earth . The researchers interpret that unusual . long and thin configuration 'as indicating a low-gravity, low-pressure . environment and rapid freeze-drying' - which could only happen in outer . space. A previous study, led . by Professor Wickramasinghe and published in the Journal of Cosmology . in January, also claimed to have found 'microscopic fossilized diatoms . (a basic form of algae)' in the samples. 'We got it from the medical research institute in Sri Lanka,' Professor Chandra Wickramasinghe told MailOnline. 'They got hold of it on the 29th December, when a fireball was seen in the area. 'Thousands of people spotted it, and minutes after there was a meteorite fall over a rice field. 'Farmers who rushed to pick up these stones had their hands burnt, and women fainted, so local medical staff and police were summoned to cordon off the area to collect the stones. 'One of these was sent to us by colleagues.' However, the professor admitted at the . time they the paper was a rush job and he and his colleagues did not . have time to conduct the necessarily analyses to confirm it was a . meteorite. To make up for that omission, in the latest study Wallis . and his colleagues also measured the chemical make up of the samples to . determine their origin, claiming that low levels of nitrogen rule our . the possibility of contamination by modern organisms. The . researchers say their findings offer 'clear and convincing evidence . that these obviously ancient remains of extinct marine algae found . embedded in the Polonnaruwa meteorite are indigenous to the stones and . not the result of post-arrival microbial contaminants.' They . add: 'The presence of fossilized biological structures provides . compelling evidence in support of the theory of cometary panspermia . first proposed over thirty years ago.' The study backs up the claims of Professor Wickramasinghe's widely rubbished January paper which claimed to have found evidence of alien life in the same rocks. Smoking gun? This scanning electron microscope image purports to show the tell-tale sign of a microscopic fossil . A mathematician by training, Professor . Wickramasinghe, 74, claims microbes from outer space arrived on our . planet from comets which then 'multiplied and seeded' to form our life 3.8billion years ago. Chandra Wickramasinghe is notorious as the only scientist to argue against evolution during the 1981 Arkansas legal case against the teaching of creationism in schools. The 74-year-old Sri Lankan-born British mathematician obtained a PhD from Cambridge under the supervision of the late Sir Fred Hoyle. The pair went on to collaborate on a body of work some credit with providing the basis of the field of astrobiology. Their joint work on the infrared spectra of interstellar grains led to developing the hypothesis of panspermia, which proposes that cosmic dust in space and comets is partly organic - and may have 'seeded' life on Earth. They further contended that extraterrestrial life forms continue to enter the Earth's atmosphere, and may be responsible for epidemic outbreaks, new diseases, and the genetic novelty necessary for macroevolution. In 2003 he was joint signatory on a letter sent to The Lancet which suggested that the virus which causes SARS may not come from chickens, but could in fact be from outer space. He was head of Cardiff University's Centre for Astrobiology until two years ago, when funding was withdrawn and he was dismissed from his post. He also believes that pathogens like the SARS virus arrived here from deep space. 'We are all aliens - we share a . cosmic ancestry,' he said at the time of the original study's . publication. 'Each time a new planetary system forms a few surviving . microbes find their way into comets. 'These then multiply and seed other planets. 'These latest finds are just more evidence to point to the overwhelming fact that life on Earth began on other worlds.' Professor Wickramasinghe was head of Cardiff University's . Centre for Astrobiology until two years ago when funding for the . department was withdrawn and he was dismissed from his post. The . controversial professor, the only scientist to testify against . evolution in the famous 1981 creationist trial in Arkansas, has since . carried on the project as a private company and charity. Critics . have already lined up to rubbish the latest study's claims and to . suggest that the methodology of the researchers was also flawed. Phil . Plait, author of Slate's Bad Astronomy blog, said: 'I read the paper, . and really it’s more of the same as from the first paper. 'In . some ways, it’s even shakier; they provide lots of technical data that . gives their work a veneer of credibility, but when you look a bit deeper . you find they didn’t do a lot of critically necessary tests to . establish the veracity of their claims.' Controversial: Professor Wickramasinghe, left, says the still-smoking rocks were found after they fell in Sri Lanka, right, after a dramatic meteor shower . Plait . claims the tests undertaken by Wallis and his colleagues did not go far . enough to confirm that the rock samples they analysed were in fact from . the meteor that appeared over Sri Lanka in December, and, even if they . were from space, the analysis was insufficient to eliminate the . possibility of contamination here on Earth. Professor Chandra Wickramasinghe is a leading proponent of panspermia, the hypothesis that life exists throughout the Universe and is spread by meteoroids, asteroids and planetoids. Panspermia proposes that life forms that can survive the effects of space, such as extremophiles, become trapped in debris that is ejected into space after collisions between asteroids and planets that harbour life. These life-forms may travel dormant for an extended amount of time before colliding randomly with other planets or intermingling with protoplanetary disks. If met with ideal conditions on a new planet's surfaces, the bacteria become active and the process of evolution begins, it is believed. He . points out that another meteorite fell to Earth in the same area in . 2004 and any samples picked up could have in fact been from this event - . long enough ago for the rocks to have become thoroughly contaminated. And . he adds that nowhere in the latest paper do the researchers indicate . that they have undertaken the usual precautions to minimise findings . which may have been caused by contamination. 'So, . they find some rocks, they claim (without enough  evidence) that . they're meteorites, and they claim (without evidence) they're from a . recent meteorite fall,' says Plait. 'They find diatoms, and they claim . (without controlling for contamination) that not only these diatoms came . from space, but that meteorites like this seeded Earth with life. 'Which is more likely: that, or that they found a rock from Earth that already had diatoms in it?' When Professor Wickramasinghe's . January paper was published, Monica Grady, professor of Planetary . Sciences at the Open University’s Faculty of Science, told MailOnline . she found the whole thing ‘laughable’. ‘There are serious inconsistencies with the data presented in the paper,' she said. ‘The most important is that the rock they have found is yet to be proven to be a meteorite. ‘Until . that is done, no credence can be placed on the findings presented, . especially when they are published in a non-mainstream journal.'","New paper reiterates claims made in January that meteorite contains traces of life from outer space .

"A young Palestinian protests with thousands of pro-Palestinian demonstrators outside parliament in London on Saturday . Jewish people in Britain are enduring a backlash of attacks, bomb threats and anti-semitic insults fuelled by the bloodshed in Gaza. More than 100 hate crimes have been recorded by police and community groups this month, more than double the usual number. Community safety groups fear the total could be the second highest ever recorded, after an explosion of violence during the 2009 Gaza war. In several disturbing cases attackers have invoked the Holocaust and even shouted: ‘Heil Hitler’ at victims. A rabbi was attacked by four Muslim teenagers outside a Jewish boarding school in Gateshead in one of the most serious incidents. In Belfast, bricks were thrown at the city’s only synagogue, smashing windows on two consecutive nights. Groups of Asian men chanted 'Heil Hitler’ as they drove through a Jewish area of Manchester, throwing missiles at passers-by. In north London, one pro-Israel organisation received a telephone bomb threat and a Jewish boy riding a bicycle had a stone thrown at his head by a woman in a niqab. More than 100 incidents have been reported to the Community Security Trust (CST), a charity that helps to protect Jews, since the start of this month. The surge in attacks and threats follows a similar trend in 2009, when up to 1,400 Palestinians were killed during the Gaza war. Mark Gardner, of the CST, said the figure is ‘at least double’ what the community safety group would expect to see. He said: ‘We have had at least double the number of incidents that we would expect, but the situation is not out of hand – as is the case in France. ‘The community is aware and alert but not panicking and life continues exactly how it should.’ More than 1,000 Palestinians, mainly civilians, have died as a result of Israel’s military strikes against Hamas, Gaza’s Islamist rulers, since the start of the conflict. Images of the bloodshed and wholesale destruction of impoverished neighbourhoods has led to international condemnation of the violence. Forty Israeli soldiers and three civilians have also been killed in fighting aimed at stopping Hamas firing rockets across the border. Scroll down for video . Protesters gathered in the shadow of the mother of parliaments to protest against Israel . In Britain, peaceful protests against the violence have been marred by vile placards including one declaring: ‘Hitler you were right!’ At a Central London march, protesters confronted a Jewish woman with her two young children and told them: ‘Burn in hell.’ Thousands of protesters yesterday marched in central London against Israel's military campaign in Gaza. Activists and supporters of the Palestinian cause gathered outside the Israeli embassy in Kensington, west London, before marching towards Parliament Square. Carrying Palestinian flags and placards with slogans such as Stop the Killing and Free Palestine, the protesters chanted 'Israel is a terror state', 'Gaza don't you cry, we will never let you die' and 'Allahu Akbar' (god is great). Activists and supporters of the Palestinian cause gathered outside the Israeli embassy in Kensington, west London, before marching towards Parliament Square . There has been also been an explosion of anti-semitic abuse on social networks, including Facebook and Twitter. One man called for a Jewish neighbourhood in London to be bombed so ‘Jews feel the pain’ of the Palestinians. In a separate incident, a BBC journalist was reprimanded after seeming to suggest western politicians failed to intervene in the Middle East because they had been ‘bought’ by the Jews. The anti-semitic backlash has been mirrored on the other side of the Channel where there have been even more violent scenes. Thousands of police officers were deployed in Berlin today as the authorities in Paris sought to ban further marches. Protesters in France, which has the world’s third largest Jewish population, have attacked synagogues, smashed the windows of Jewish-owned businesses and set others on fire. In Germany an Imam reportedly called on Muslims to murder ‘Zionist Jews’ and Jewish people have been attacked in the street.

"An amateur photographer was left hopping with happiness after spotting a frog that resembles the iconic Star Wars character Jabba the Hutt. With its slimy looking skin and green and brown hue, this Australian green tree frog has a remarkable likeness to the obese crime lord from Return Of The Jedi.

"Local councils are wasting £200million a year because they insist on using bins of different sizes and colours, according to a study on recycling. If Britain’s 406 local authorities agreed on a common waste collection strategy they could save a quarter of the cost of buying bins – simply by purchasing in bulk. Each bin costs an average of £20, around £5 more than it would in Germany where there is a single rubbish strategy across the country. Disjointed: This graphic illustrates how one council - Newcastle-Under-Lyme - uses nine different types of bin. This contrasts to Germany where bins are standardised across the country. The study by the Circular Economy Task Force, a think tank, said: ‘In Germany, all bins are the same. The high volume makes the unit cost cheap. ‘In the UK, few local authorities jointly purchase bins, and many insist on expressing local preferences through bin colour, embossed logos and the like.’ Researchers found that out of a  sample of 40 councils, only two had co-operated on purchasing wheelie bins. They also found big differences in recycling policies. Some councils collect plastic food packaging, for example, while others do not, some insist that items are separated into different bins while others collect all recyclable waste in the same bag. The report said that the failure to co-ordinate recycling was partly responsible for the lack of progress in improving recycling rates, which rose by just 0.2 percentage points to 43.2 per cent in England between 2012 and 2013. Inefficient: A Green Alliance graphic showing how Britain is wasting money by opting for a variety of bins . Waste: Overall, the UK is losing £1.7billion a year from disjointed and outdated measures for recycling . Overall, the UK is losing £1.7billion a year from disjointed and outdated measures for recycling waste food, plastics and electronic items, the study said. Council tax could be reduced by £61 per household per year if authorities improved their collection systems and stopped sending recyclable plastics, electronic items and food to landfill, it calculated. The report, called Wasted Opportunities, said: ‘Devolving power and making councils accountable to their citizens is surely a good thing. But insisting on local difference without sufficient information about where this creates perverse outcomes means that citizens cannot hold politicians to account.’ Dustin Benton, co-author of the report, added: ‘Valuable raw  materials are lost while businesses are frustrated by a lack of usable recycled materials. ‘The system both stymies demand for recycled materials and prevents businesses investing. ‘The problem is structural. The Government could easily turn this around by reforming the system to help businesses get the UK moving toward a circular economy.’ Rubbish: UK councils’ disjointed approach to purchasing bins is costing the taxpayer £200million a year . The report follows the announcement last week that families in Bury, Greater Manchester, will only have their household rubbish collected once every three weeks in a bid to cut costs . Yesterday a Government spokesman said: ‘The amount of household waste recycled, composted and reused is almost four times what it was in 2000, but there is still more to do.’ A spokesman for the Local Government Association added: ‘The types of bin which would suit a detached five-bedroom house in the country would be completely unsuitable for a 20-storey block of flats in inner-city London and vice versa. ‘Councils have to take account of the types of homes in their areas when they plan the frequency of waste and recycling collections and the size and type of container is a key part of this.’ ‘There is no one-size-fits-all solution to bin collections and decisions are best made at a local level.’","UK councils opt for differently designed bins instead of a standard model .

"California's Latino population is going to overtake the white population in only two months, according to this year's state budget report. The state is also getting older, with the population of over 65s predicted to hit a boom over the coming months. The state has been getting more diverse for a while, but now the Latino population will be 'the single largest race or ethnic group', and it's thought to be because most Latino groups are in their prime childbearing years. The Latino community have long been the minority among the large and mixed population of California, but this year's budget predicts that they will finally overtake the non-white Hispanic population by 0.2 per cent . According to the 2013-2014 report, by March Latinos will make up 39 per cent of California's population of 38.2 million, and non-Hispanic whites will make up 38.8 per cent. This means that Latino population outstrips the white population by around only 76,400 people. This change was actually predicted to happen seven moths ago, but Latino birth rates were lower than predicted. The figures from last years budget show that the gap is closing between the two demographic groups. Latino population campaign for equal rights outside of California state house . In the demographic report for 2011-2012 whites made up 40 per cent of California's population and Hispanics made up 39 per cent. This is dramatically different to 25 years ago, where whites made up around 57 per cent of California's population and Latinos only made up around 26 per cent. The report, which in addition to detailing California's annual budget, predicts social and demographic trends, also predicted that the California has an ageing population. The number of residents aged 65 and older will rise by 20.7 per cent over the next five years, and 18-45 year-olds will suffer a 4.5 per cent decline, as over 1,000 Californians turn 65 every day. This change in the majority ethnicity and the average state age is thought to have severe impacts on the democratic changes to California over the next 15 years. Mindy Romero, director of the California Civic Engagement Project said: 'Demographic changes that are coming will reshape the electorate. The median age of the Latino population has reached 28, which are said to be prime childbearing years, and is thought to be the reason for Latino population overtaking the non-white hispanic population . 'In turn that will likely have impacts on policies and issues that decision makers focus on in the coming decades' 'A big question mark is about what that means for policy for youth. 'Older voters often aren't as supportive of youth-specific policies.' In addition, Asian groups are predicted to rise from a current 13 per cent, but because of immigration rather than increased birthing rates. Bruce Mirken, spokesman for the Greenling institute, a group that advocates for communities of colour, said that the government and private sector both need to adapt to these predictions. He said: 'It's less about one group being a couple tenths more of the population than another group, but more about a continuing trend for California being a majority-minority state' 'Everything that government does, that private industry does, needs to react to that reality.' Overall, the state, that has had steady growth over the last economic year, is predicted to have a 300,000 population rise by July of 2014.","By March Latino population will outstrip the white population by over 70,000 .

"Booze prices in the Commons have been frozen again - even though MPs' food and drink is subsidised by millions of pounds a year. Taxpayers are forced to stump up £7million a year to keep restaurant and bar bills down in Parliament. This allows pints of beer to cost as little as £2.90 in the Commons and Lords' exclusive riverside bars. The public subsidy for MPs' food and drink runs into the millions every year, House of Commons figures reveal . Senior MPs on the Finance and Services Committee have revealed that charges will be kept on hold until at least next May. Once inflation is taken into account, the booze prize freeze is actually a cut. The freeze also means prices will have been only been raised three times in the five years of the current Parliament. By the time the price freeze ends, MPs will have landed a ten per cent pay hike, with salaries due to rise to £74,000. Taxpayers' Alliance chief Jonathan Isaby said: 'What planet are these MPs living on? Food and drink prices have not been frozen for the rest of us, so why should it be any different for our elected representatives? 'No wonder politicians seem out of touch. It's time for a sobering reality check - taxpayers shouldn't be subsidising cheap alcohol.' But a Commons spokeswoman said: 'Benchmark prices have not moved significantly and current targets to drive sales and control costs are being met.' Last year it was revealed that the bars, restaurants and cafes in the House of Commons cost taxpayers £4.9million in 2012/13 - a subsidy of £7,500 per MP. MPs have access to the outside terrace of Strangers' Bar in Parliament - a sister pub to the the Strangers' Dining Room which is getting a £200,000 facelift . The eight venues selling food and drink in the Lords needed a further £2.3million of public cash, according to freedom of information. This meant the total subsidy for both houses was £7.2million. The revelation comes after MPs signed off on plans to spend more than £200,000 doing up Parliament's most exclusive restaurant. The plush Strangers’ Dining Room will be almost entirely refurbished, House of Commons authorities have confirmed. A ten-week touch up will take place during the MPs’ summer holiday this year - with the carpets, curtains and fireplaces set to be given an overhaul. A Commons spokesman claimed the refurbishment would pay for itself - because it is can be hired out when MPs are away from Parliament on recess. It is not only MPs who benefit from cheap food and drink prices in Parliament. Taxpayers are being stung for more than £1million a year to subsidise restaurants, bars and cafes for members of the House of Lords as well. The peers’ fine dining discount comes on top of the £300 per day they get for attending the Lords, which is supposed to cover their food as well as accommodation. We paid £757,696 in 2011-12 to subsidise Westminster’s Peers’ Dining Room, where lords, bishops and baronesses can enjoy a starter of marinated king scallops with baby fennel, blood orange, puffed pork rind and crisp shallots for just £7. The self-service River Restaurant offers more everyday dishes at bargain prices – thanks to a handout of £501,646 from the taxpayer. Another £246,307 of our money went to the plush Barry Room restaurant, where only £6 will buy a hungry peer a starter of quail with pancetta popcorn, sweetcorn and red onions. But a spokesman for the Lords said: 'The Lord catering subsidy has been reduced by 27 per cent since 2007 and the House continues to focus on seeking further savings. 'Our catering services meet the needs of working House of Parliament and due to the unpredictable nature of sittings of the House, and periods where the House doesn’t sit and so revenue is not generated, a subsidy is unavoidable. 'As a London Living Wage employer catering costs for the Lords are higher than many commercial operations where staff are paid at below that rate.'","MPs have voted to freeze their own bar bills to keep beer prices to £2.90 .

"Found all over the world, natural pearls . have long been prized for their beauty and have been worn by everyone . from Cleopatra to the Queen. From the pearl-drop earring worn by Charles I to his execution in 1649 to the delicate cultured pearl necklace presented to Marylin Monroe by Joe DiMaggio in 1954, the history of the gem is more exciting than their innocuous cream shimmer would suggest. Now the V&A is to bring the history of the pearl to life with a new exhibition that will feature 200 different pieces of pearl jewellery. On display: A dancer doing a grand jeté made from gold with diamonds and two cultured baroque pearls . Stunning: A German cross pendant dating from 1500 (left) and a French pair of seed pearl earrings from 1795 . The exhibition includes a necklace owned by Marylin Monroe and an earring worn by King Charles I (above) Along with Monroe's necklace and Charles I's earring, the exhibition, which is to be held in conjunction with the Qatar Museums Authority, will also feature pieces made in ancient Rome, Greece and Persia, where pearls were used to indicate rank. Later on in the medieval period, pearls became a Christian symbol representing purity and chastity, as seen in the Annunciation scene featured on the Hylle Jewel. But the Renaissance saw pearls make a return to the jeweller's table, when they became popular among members of the aristocracy. One of the most famous pearl-wearers of the era was the tragic English queen, Anne Boleyn, who famously wore a choker of pearls with a delicate 'B' pendant below.

"In a surprising trend, consumers are increasingly buying retro phones such as this Ericsson R290 Satellite which came out in 1999 . Remember when snake was all you needed to be entertained? Now, the retro mobile game could be making a comeback, along with the vintage handsets it was played on. Consumers harking back to a simpler era are turning their backs on smartphones by embracing bulky, vintage mobiles, with retro features. The demand for these old-school phones is so high that some models of old Nokias, Ericssons and Motorolas are now fetching up to €1,000 (£810 or $1,360) a piece. While they may lack features, these retro phones are simple to use, have batteries that last the week and are practically indestructible compared to their smartphone equivalent. ‘Some people don't blink at the prices, we have models at more than €1,000 (£810 or $1,360),’ said Djassem Haddad, who started the site vintagemobile.fr in 2009. ‘The high prices are due to the difficulty in finding those models, which were limited editions in their time.’ For instance, a Nokia 8800 Arte Gold is currently listed on the site for €1,000 (£810 or $1,360), while a Nokia 8800 could be purchased for €250 (£200 or $337) Mr Haddad had been hoping to explore what he believed to be a niche market, but since last year, sales have taken off.

Finnish firm Nokia, the biggest mobile phone company before the advent of Apple's iPhone or Samsung's Galaxy, offloaded its handset division to Microsoft this year after failing to catch the smartphone wave. But it was probably also the supposedly irreversible switch towards smartphone that has given the old school phone an unexpected boost.

There is ‘a great sensation of finding an object that we knew during another era - a little like paying for vintage sneakers that we couldn't afford when we were teenagers,’ Mr Douani told AFP. There is also ‘a logic of counter-culture in reaction to the over-connectedness of today's society, with disconnection being the current trend.’ ‘That includes the need to return to what is essential and a basic telephone that is used only for making phone calls and sending SMSes,’ he added. It is also about ‘being different.

"Leader of the pack: Rusty Sherrill, 57, is the alleged orchestrator of the plot . A mother rescued her daughter from a house where three depraved captors had held and tortured her for eight months, it was revealed today. Three men were arrested this week for holding the woman prisoner and repeatedly assaulting her in Winnie,Texas, last year. Rusty Sherrill, 57, James Ruff, 23, and Max Ruff, 21, allegedly kidnapped the unnamed woman in September 2011 after her relationship with one of them ended, and held her captive and repeatedly assaulted her until May 2012. The victim's mother rescued her daughter and took her to a hospital, officials revealed but did not provide further details of the rescue. The beatings were so bad she remained in a coma for four weeks, a Chambers . County Sheriff’s Office announcement first reported by the Houston Chronicle said. ‘Initially, it was a relationship between Sherrill and the female that went downhill,’ a sheriff’s office spokesperson told the Chronicle.

"Michael Schumacher is gradually being woken from his coma and is responding 'positively' to the treatment, according to a French newspaper. L’Equipe said according to its sources, medics treating the German Formula One champion, who has been in an artificial coma since his skiing accident on December 29, started the phase of gradual awakening this week. The news comes as Schumacher enters his fifth week of a medically induced coma, and there are fears he may remain in a 'persistent vegetative state' for the rest of his life even if the awakening treatment is successful. Scroll down for video . Michael Schumacher is being slowly brought out of his induced coma, his manager has said. His wife Corinna insists her husband is a 'fighter' who will not give up . Schumacher is in a stable condition after suffering severe head injuries in a skiing accident . The national newspaper, devoted to . sport, wrote: 'After four consecutive weeks in a coma, Michael . Schumacher has been placed, according to our information, in a phase of . gradual awakening. It is a slow and uncertain process of return... Michael Schumacher is responding positively to the process, started this week.' In the case of traumatic brain injury, . such as that sustained by Schumacher, doctors sometimes induce a coma. Shutting down function can give the brain time to heal. To end the coma . the dosage of powerful aneasthetic drugs being administered is gradually . reduced. Schumacher’s spokeswoman Sabine Kehm reiterated that speculation about his condition should be ignored. In . a statement she said: 'I insist again on the fact that any statement on . the health of Michael Schumacher that does not come from the medical . team in charge or his management is just speculation.' Seven-time . world champion Schumacher, 45, has been receiving round-the-clock care . in Grenoble Hospital since December 29 when he hit his head on a rock . while skiing off-piste in Meribel, in the French Alps. His wife Corinna, 44, with whom the champion has two children Gina Marie, 16, and Mick, 14, has remained at his bedside. The family has received more than 1000 letters of support. 'Deeply moved': Schumacher's Rolf Schumacher and brother Ralf arrive at Grenoble Hospital earlier this month. His family have issued a heartfelt thank you to fans around the world for their support . Strain: Corinna Schumacher and their children have been maintaining a constant bedside vigil since his crash . In . a statement, the family said: 'We are deeply touched by all the . messages to get well soon for Michael which are still being sent. That . gives us strength. Thank you all so much... We all know he is a fighter and will not give up.' Yesterday it was revealed that Schumacher is being given muscle training in order to stop his muscles from withering away. The Formula One star is receiving muscle therapy so that his body will not seize up as he stays sedated in intensive care in Grenoble following his ski accident four weeks ago. He was placed into an artificially . induced coma shortly after the crash, but such . measures normally last only a maximum of two weeks. 'Patients . in comas need limbs and joints moved daily to ensure muscles do not . atrophy,' emergency medicine expert Professor Heinzpeter Moecke told The . Sun. One Austrian website reported Schumacher, 45, may suffer from Apallic Syndrome or persistent vegetative state. Jean-Marc . Orgogozo, Professor of Neurology at the University of Bordeaux, said: . 'Every day, every week in a coma the chances decline that the situation . is improving'. Probe: Investigators at the site of Schumacher's crash earlier this month where he smashed his head on a rock while skiing off-piste in Meribel, France . The the support of his wife Corinne, 44, his two teenaged children, brother and closest friends cannot mask the fact that more than four weeks in an artificial coma means that he is far from anywhere near recovery. A persistent vegetative state is one in which patients with severe brain damage are in a state of partial arousal rather than true awareness. This means that if doctors do bring him out of his artificially induced coma he would be unable to speak, move or feed himself. The . format.at news website said; 'More than three weeks after the tragic . skiing accident of the seven-time Formula 1 World Champion Michael . Schumacher, hope dwindle for a  full recovery. 'For more than three weeks now Schumacher lies in a medically induced coma at the University Hospital in Grenoble. Get well soon! Cologne and Schalke stars hold out a banner wishing Michael Schumacher good health . Apallic Syndrome - or persistent vegetative state - occurs when a patient with severe brain damage remains in a state of partial arousal rather than true awareness after waking from a coma. Patients can breathe on their own and circulate because their brainstem remains intact, but they are largely unresponsive to stimulation. The chance of recovery from Apallic Syndrome are far below 50 per cent. There is no treatment, but a person can live for many years with the right medical care. He is fed there with probes, washed daily and moved again and again to avoid a bed sores.' It . goes on to speculate that the 'severe damage' he suffered to his brain . in a ski accident on December 29 could result in the permanent vegative . state suffered by around 10,000 of his German countrymen. This . would mean, if and when he is brought out of the coma by his medical . team, 'that his condition would hardly be different from the medically . induced coma'. Apallic . Syndrome is always the result of a severe brain injury. The chance of . recovery from Apallic Syndrome are far below 50 per cent.' Schumacher's . condition remains stable but there is a firewall of silence from his . medical team about the intense battle being waged to try to bring him . back to normality. Brain . injury patients are placed into artificial comas to reduce the amount . of oxygen that flows into the brain, thus making it work less and giving . it time to heal. Such comas usually last for a maximum of two weeks, although there have been instances of patients being under longer. As . Schumacher enters his fourth week in such a state neurological experts . are starting to doubt whether he might ever recover sufficiently to be . brought out of his sleep. Meanwhile, his family have paid tribute to Bundesliga sides Cologne and Schalke on the Formula One legend’s official website. Players . from both sides held up a banner which read ‘Get Well Soon! You can do . it, Michael’ prior to their friendly on Saturday in honour of the . 45-year-old German, who is a Cologne supporter. The . message from the seven-time champion’s family is the first in over a . fortnight and comes just days after it was confirmed that he is in a . stable condition at Grenoble Hospital.","French media say Michael Schumacher is being taken out of artificial coma .

"One of the schoolgirl sisters who fled Britain to join ISIS and marry warlords has admitted she is proud to be known as a 'Terror Twin' and 'loves' living in Syria. Salma and Zahra Halane, who have 28 GCSEs between them, ran away from their family in Chorlton, Greater Manchester, a month ago for 'paradise' in the war torn Middle East. They have vowed never to return home after following their brother to Syria and social media updates suggest the pair are training to use grenades and Kalashnikov rifles. Scroll down for video . Extremists: Salma and Zahra Halane, who have 28 GCSEs between them, have vowed to use their skills for ISIS and are revelling in the fame of being called the 'Terror Twins' One of them, who has taken the name Umm Ja'far, has tweeted a slew of fanatical messages, including several revealing she still plans to be a doctor - but only so she can treat ISIS fighters. In her latest exchange online she told The Sun: 'I love the name Terror Twin because it makes me sound scary. Isis love it when they make us sound scary because it makes us a big threat so I love it. She added: 'I support the executions of Syrian soldiers. It's self defence.' The twins are now believed to be based in Raqqa, Syria - an Isis stronghold - where they are said to have already married fighters. The sisters were hard-working students who hoped to train as doctors. One recent tweet from their account said: 'Training to be doctors to Training to be killers... I will become a doctor for Isis not for these pagans'. Mocking: The girls have mocked media reports of their disappearance in tweets sent from Raqqa, Syria, and suggest they are being trained to use deadly weapons . The pair left Manchester after sneaking from their bedrooms in the middle of the night and caught a flight to Turkey, before crossing the border into Syria. Police said the pair are thought to have followed their elder brother, who also ditched his own ‘excellent’ academic career to join the ISIS terror group around a year ago. Friends said the twins had appeared to be typical teenagers, pouting for selfies and shopping at Primark – but they are now feared to be training for battle. The twins’ parents raised the alarm after finding the girls’ beds empty and their passports and clothes missing. A former neighbour said the couple had been ‘quite strict’, and did not allow the girls to ‘mix with other children on the street’. Last month a rebel fighter boasted that he was teaching girls as young as 16 how to fight. Yilmaz, a Dutch national who has been in Syria for two years said: ‘It’s extremely easy to get here. People go on holiday ... they end up in Syria.’","Salma and Zahra Halane 'love' living in Syria because it's 'paradise'

"E-cigarettes cause less harm than smoking tobacco to users and bystanders, a major scientific review has concluded. Although the long-term health effects are unknown, current evidence does not justify regulating them more strictly than conventional cigarettes – or even as strictly. The review, carried out by researchers at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL), says health workers should support smokers who want to reduce their use of tobacco by switching to electronic cigarettes. Scroll down for video . Around 1.3million Britons use battery-powered e-cigarettes. The devices work by converting liquid nicotine into a mist, allowing users to inhale the drug while avoiding the harm caused by tobacco smoke (File photo) Professor Peter Hajek, of the UK Centre for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies at QMUL, said: ‘The evidence we currently have is clear: e-cigarettes should be allowed to compete against conventional cigarettes in the marketplace. ‘Health care professionals may advise smokers who are unwilling to cease nicotine use to switch to e-cigarettes.’ Around 1.3m Britons use e-cigarettes . Around 1.3million Britons use battery-powered e-cigarettes. The devices work by converting liquid nicotine into a mist, allowing users to inhale the drug while avoiding the harm caused by tobacco smoke. Some countries, including Norway, Singapore and Brazil, have banned them altogether. In Wales, health legislators are consulting on plans to make it the first part of the UK to ban e-cigarettes in enclosed public places. The UK’s drug watchdog has decided they must be regulated as medicines to make the products ‘safer and more effective’ but this won’t happen until 2016. E-cigarettes are thought to be healthier than normal smoking because they do not contain tobacco and other carcinogens found in cigarettes. But some experts have since expressed concerns about certain chemicals contained in the liquid, notably the compound propylene glycol. The scientific review, conducted by an international team of leading tobacco researchers and published in the journal Addiction, looked at 81 studies of e-cigarettes (EC) presenting original data that could guide regulatory decisions. It found the long-term health effects of e-cigarettes are not known. ‘However, based on the data available regarding the toxicant content of EC liquid and aerosols, long-term use of EC, compared to smoking, is likely to be much less, if at all, harmful to users or bystanders’ says the report. It also finds there is no evidence to back the claim by critics that e-cigarettes act as a ‘gateway’ to smoking in young people. In fact, there has been a drop in children becoming smokers at the same time that e-cigarette sales have grown, says the report. Yet many doctors want tighter regulations on e-cigarettes, according to a new poll from online network Doctors.net.uk. The poll, conducted among 525 primary care and hospital doctors, found that one in seven asked said e-cigarettes should be prescription-only – while one in six did not think e-cigarettes should be on the market at all.","Long-term health effects are unknown for e-cigarettes .

"Just 24 hours earlier she was walking down the aisle in front of gushing friends and relatives. But for Jennifer Grant - wedded bliss soon turned to sheer terror after a spontaneous bodyboarding session left her swimming for her life as fierce currents threatened to drag her out to sea. The newly-wed, 30, and her husband, Warren, were caught in a dangerous rip current off Porth Beach, Cornwall yesterday and Mrs Grant had to be rescued by lifeboats while clinging to a rock. Scroll down for video . Traumatised: Jennifer Grant is photographed alongside her husband, Warren, (right) after being rescued clinging for dear life to a rock following a bodyboarding session in Cornwall . A rescue officer comforts Mrs Grant as she is taken to an ambulance with her husband, Warren (right) - 24 hours after the couple were wed . For an almost an hour, she lay trapped on top of the slippery surface while waves thrashed over it - sweeping away her husband and a friend who had also been taking refuge in the same spot. Despite being tossed violently against the rocks by powerful waves and having to hurl herself into a rescue boat - she suffered only shock and scratches in the 'terrifying' ordeal. The couple from Ottery St Mary, Devon, were married at the Sands Hotel on Saturday and wanted to make the most of the beach hire facilities before they returned home. Mrs Grant, a dental nurse, and Mr Grant, 41, a production manager, were in the water with friends Mitch Seward and Scott Ward. They had been in the sea for around 45 minutes before getting caught in a rip current. Mrs Grant said: 'The sea wasn't rough - it was a little choppy when we went in. Then Warren got caught in a rip and dragged towards rocks. Bliss: The couple had enjoyed a 'perfect wedding' the day before and decided to make the most of the Cornish beach before heading back home to Devon . 'I watched him climb on to the rock then I tried to get back to shore. But I couldn't get in and realised Mitch and I were caught in the rip and being dragged to the rock too. 'I was going to climb on to it when a wave smashed me into it and cut me up. 'We managed to get on to the rock with Warren but the tide was coming in and a wave then came and swept Warren away in to the sea. 'It was white water at the foot foot of the sheer drop he had been swept off - but luckily he managed to get back to shore. Today Mrs Grant said: 'We were just so lucky - it could have been so much worse' For an almost an hour, she lay trapped on top of the slippery surface of a rock while waves thrashed over it . The couple's friend, Mr Seward, was also swept from the rock and waited in the water in case Mrs Grant decided to jump in. But she insisted he save himself and head back to the shore while he still had the energy to swim. She added: 'By this time the tide was coming in and the waves were crashing over the rock I was on. I was terrified but Warren had always told me not to panic. 'Everybody on the beach thought I was going to jump in but I wasn't going to do that. I'd been there half-an-hour and the waves were washing right over the rock by this time. The dental nurse added: 'It was definitely a strange day after such a special perfect wedding' She escaped without injury but was taken to the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro to be treated for shock . 'Terrifying': After 45 minutes in the sea, Mrs Grant, her husband and a friend, Mitch Seward, (right) were caught in a fierce rip tide . 'Scott had climbed on the cliff behind the rock and was shouting to me ""stay where you are"". 'All of a sudden I heard a helicopter and thought it was coming to me but it flew over and kept going. It turned out there was another rescue going on nearby.' The rescue helicopter from RNAS Culdrose in Helston had been called out to winch two men to safety after they became stranded on the nearby Barrowfields beach and sand dunes area. Mrs Grant added: 'I was right at the back of the rock by this time as far away from the waves as I could get. 24 hours earlier: On Saturday the 30-year-old married Warren Grant in a beautful ceremony at the Sands Hotel . Scene of serenity: The newly-wed has thanked the RNLI for saving her life just one day after her wedding . 'Then I saw the rescue boat arriving and a lifeguard jumped in with a life-jacket. He led me down to the boat which was struggling against the waves and told me to jump. 'But it was so scary. I managed to jump but I landed badly on the boat - thankfully the crew managed to catch me and haul me in. 'They took me back to shore where I had a check up in the ambulance. Thankfully I just had a few cuts and scratches. 'We were just so lucky - it could have been so much worse. It was definitely a strange day after such a special perfect wedding.' She expressed her gratitude to the RNLI for saving her and is now preparing to jet off to Egypt next week for her honeymoon. A spokeswoman for the RNLI said: 'The newlywed bride had been taking a post wedding surf at Porth beach when she got into difficulties. 'She had managed to scramble onto the rocks on Porth Island but was unable to make her way back to shore.' Porth Beach in Cornwall is a popular tourist destination but the currents can be dangerous .

"Islamic State have released a new propaganda video featuring young boys undertaking military training. Entitled 'The Blood of Jihad 2', it is the second video in a series revealing life inside the training camps of Islamic State. It was filmed in the IS held province of Nineveh, Iraq. The highly choreographed video opens with dramatic slow motion shots of a group of young boys firing AK 47s advancing in a line - all are wearing matching military camouflage fatigues and chequered headscarves. Scroll down for video . In the newest propaganda film from Isis five boys are shown patrolling in a line - their guns appear oversized in their hands as they move their weapons left to right as if searching for an imaginary enemy (pictured) The first part of the film, which appears to be shot in soft focus and is set to music, then shows the boys undertaking training in martial arts. One of the boys can be seen holding the black flag of Islamic State whilst another of the boys, wearing a headband with a slogan in Arabic, leads the martial arts drill. The boys stand in five neat lines, carefully holding their formation. Most of the boys look no older than 12 or 13 years old and their uniforms hang loosely off their slim bodies. The video goes on to show similar scenes to the first video of the series which featured the training of adult IS fighters. Some boys are shown holding 'ceramic' slates over their heads and when the order is given each boy slowly takes it in turn to smash their slate over their exposed head - but it smashes surprisingly easily . A bearded adult fighter is shown striking a wooden cane over one of the child soldier's head - but the boy barely flinches, casting doubts over how solid the 'cane' is . A bearded adult fighter, acting as one of the boy's brigade trainers, is shown striking a wooden cane over one of the child soldier's head. The cane is shown shattering on impact with the young boy's skull - but the boy barely flinches, casting doubts over how solid the piece of wood really is. In another highly choreographed scene the teacher is seen moving to another boy, 'punching' repeatedly into his abdomen - despite appearing to barely make contact. With his his hands held behind his head, the boy withstands the 'punches' before he eventually staggers back. His teacher then kicks him on the shins and continues to land punches on his stomach whilst the other boys watch on. Next, ten of the boys are shown forming a two tiered human pyramid. One of the boys performs a running leap and acrobatically lands on top of the boys. Standing upon their linked arms, the boy steadies himself before triumphantly holding aloft Islamic State's flag. The video continues to show off the young recruits skills with the next scene showing one of the boys disarming a fellow trainee who is posing as a gunman and successfully demobilising eight other boys through unarmed combat. When kicked in the shins the boy deftly turns the fall into a cartwheel - again suggesting the video has been very carefully, and heavily, choreographed. Despite their dramatic shouts, the boys do not seem to make contact with each other, and each falls carefully to the floor and remains there while the victor makes his way around the circle. Such ninja skills are a popular feature of IS training videos, despite most of their soldiers having few opportunities to use ninja skills on the frontline. The video shows each boy take it in turn to run across the field, dive down behind some sandbags and fire off a few rounds of their AK 47s at the imaginary enemy . Other scenes show the boys undertaking more core training with their teacher, punching and hitting them with wooden sticks. Five of the boys are then shown holding 'ceramic' slates over their heads. When the order is given by their teacher each boy slowly takes it in turn to smash their slate over their exposed head - but again, the slates smash surprisingly easily, almost on contact. It would appear the slate is either extremely flimsy or it has been prepared to snap easily. The video then shows a set of press ups and squats are completed by the group of 30 boys. Some of the boys are then shown in the press up position as their teacher goes around, 'kicking' each boy in the stomach to see if they collapse onto the ground. After receiving the blow with apparent ease, each boy leaps up, dusts themselves off and watches their comrades complete the task. Gym training is followed by patrolling tactics with machine guns. Five boys, wearing chequered headscarves and black tunics are shown cautiously patrolling in a line. The propaganda video shows the group of boys complete a set of press ups and squats . Their guns appear oversized in their small hands as they move their weapons left and right as if they are searching for an imaginary enemy. They halt and form a small circle to discuss tactics whilst one of the boys is ordered to break off from the group and run across no man's land towards a steep hill. Despite the fact the guns do not appear to be loaded, the scene is accompanied by the deafening roar of gunfire and explosions. Each boy takes it in turn to run across the field, dive down behind some sandbags and fire off a few rounds of their AK 47s at the imaginary enemy. Two of the boys then race up a steep hill, where they proceed to round up a number of 'prisoners'. They lead the prisoners back down the hill, forcing them to keep their hands behind their heads and dragging them by their scarfs with a gun barrel menacingly positioned in their back. The shocking video finishes with the young recruits taking it in turns to thank each of their teachers, shaking their hands and kissing them on their cheek.","New propaganda video shows young boys undergoing military training .

"At least half a dozen Conservative Cabinet ministers would opt for Britain to leave the EU on the current terms of membership, senior party sources claim. The mood at the top of the party has hardened ahead of David Cameron’s proposed negotiation of looser ties with Brussels, followed by an in/out referendum by 2017 if he remains in power after the next election. Three ministers – Philip Hammond, Michael Gove and Oliver Letwin – have suggested publicly that they would back an exit unless significant changes can be secured. At least three others are understood to be of a similar view. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, Chief Whip Michael Gove and policy minister Oliver Letwin have all uggested publicly that they would back an exit unless significant changes can be secured . Former Environment Secretary Owen Paterson yesterday insisted Britain should invoke the nuclear option of setting itself on course for an EU exit. Warning Conservative MPs who defect to Ukip are ‘stupid’, since they undermine the one party willing to ‘sort out’ Britain’s relationship with Brussels, Mr Paterson also called on Mr Cameron to develop ‘robust’ policies to win back disaffected Tory voters. The MP, who is emerging as a leader of the Tory Right having been sacked by the Prime Minister in the summer, suggested that the party’s election manifesto should significantly harden its position on Europe. In a speech in London, the former Environment Secretary suggested that Britain invokes Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty signed by the last Labour government - the mechanism for an EU exit. That would legally compel the EU to negotiate the terms of British exit within two years - preventing the foot-dragging and obstruction in Brussels that is otherwise likely as Mr Cameron seeks to negotiate looser ties. David Cameron has been reluctant to say that he would recommend an ‘out’ vote in the referendum if he does not get what he wants when trying to claw back powers . Mr Paterson said he favoured a Norway-style agreement with the EU that would allow the UK access to the single market but remove it from the ‘political project’ in Brussels. It is not so much that we are leaving the EU, as much as the political project of the EU has left us,’ he said. He insisted Britain had come to a ‘fork in the road’ in its relationship with the EU, adding: ‘To sort out the nightmare of the euro, they have got to form a cohesive, effective new state. ‘And meanwhile, we withdraw from the political arrangements and we concentrate on trade, which gives us an opportunity to get our seat back on the supra-national bodies which actually decide regulation affecting virtually every business in this country.’ Mr Paterson said a ‘significant’ number of Conservative MPs and the majority of activists would now favour an EU exit unless significant changes can be achieved. But he insisted defecting to Ukip was counterproductive. ‘It would be very unwise if any others do go, most unwise. What is clear is that if you defect you don’t get the referendum, so if you are very keen on a referendum as a Conservative party backbencher you are very stupid to go and defect,’ he said. Mr Paterson called on fellow Eurosceptics to make a more compelling case for Britain’s prospects outside the EU - predicting that if an in/out referendum were held today, voters would choose to stay in. ‘Voters have not been presented with a clear vision of what life outside the EU would look like for the UK and in the absence of any detail I am convinced that if an “in-out” referendum were held today, there would be a natural tendency to vote for the status quo,’ he said. ‘The establishment view will be clearly to stay within the political organisation of the EU. ‘The answer to this is to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. It is the only legally binding mechanism that we can use to require the rest of the EU to enter formal negotiations with us, on setting out a new relationship,’ Mr Paterson said. Mr Paterson said he favoured a Norway-style agreement with the EU that would allow the UK access to the single market but remove it from the ‘political project’ in Brussels . Following the second Tory byelection defeat to Ukip last week, Mr Cameron is facing calls from some Eurosceptic Tories to toughen his position on a potential British exit from the EU. The Prime Minister will use a speech expected within the next ten days to flesh out details of his aim to limit the numbers of EU migrants, get Britain out of the EU’s founding goal of ‘ever closer union’ and allow small groups of national parliaments to block unwanted European legislation. Downing Street sources were cool about Mr Paterson’s proposal, pointing out using Article 50 would set Britain on course for exit, pre-empting the planned referendum. ‘The whole point is the British people should decide – not Westminster or the Government,’ said one. Unlike Labour, the Conservatives are committed to giving voters the choice in an in/out referendum on membership by the end of the 2017 after attempting to rengotiate a looser, more trade-based relationship for the UK with the Continent. But Mr Cameron has been reluctant to say that he would recommend an ‘out’ vote in the referendum if he does not get what he wants when trying to claw back powers. Labour leader Ed Miliband reiterated that Britain would not leave the EU if Labour wins May’s election. He said: ‘I’m afraid the Conservative Party, again today, are a party sleepwalking towards the exit door of the European Union.’ He added that such a move would be ‘bad for jobs, bad for investment, bad for businesses’.","Ministers would be ready to leave the EU on current terms of membership .

"Former boxing promoter Kellie Maloney has said she feared that her head would explode after her agonising facial reconstruction surgery went drastically wrong. Maloney, 61, who is around 18 months into her transition period to change gender, reportedly suffered internal bleeding and required emergency surgery after she had a reaction to the operation at a Belgian clinic. She had undergone the operation two weeks ago to make her face appear more feminine, but instead her face ballooned to twice its normal size and she almost stopped breathing. Before and after: Former boxing promoter Kellie Maloney has said she feared that her head would explode after her agonising facial reconstruction surgery went drastically wrong . Twice-married Maloney, who as boxing promoter Frank helped Lennox Lewis to become world heavyweight champion, says her eyes were bleeding, and she resembled Frankenstein's Monster after the surgery in Antwerp. She was in intensive care for four days after the operation, and needed specialist equipment to help her to breathe. 'I just felt my head inflating like a balloon. It was getting bigger and bigger by the second, I could hardly see. I feared it was going to explode,' she told the Sunday Mirror's Matthew Drake. Maloney, who has three children, has been hooked up to a tube to drain the excess fluid from her head, and worries about what her face will look like once the swelling has subsided. Complications: Maloney said her head felt like it was 'inflating like a balloon', and her eyes were bleeding . 'It was as if I had gone ten rounds with Mike Tyson in his pomp and another ten with Lennox Lewis for good measure,' she said, but says doctors are confident that she will make a full recovery and will be pleased with the final results. Maloney, who announced earlier this year that she was now living as a woman, has already undergone hormone therapy, electrolysis to remove excess body hair, counselling and voice coaching. The Celbrity Big Brother star said she had undergone previous facial surgery in Spain without any issue, so felt confident before going to hospital for surgery on her nose, eyelids and cheeks, as well as a facelift. Post surgery: The Celebrity Big Brother star said she had undergone previous surgery in Spain without any issue, so felt confident before the operations on her nose, eyelids and cheeks, as well as a facelift . But it is thought that Asprin tablets she has taken to thin her blood after suffering a heart attack stopped her surgery wounds from healing properly, which sparked the complications and bleeding. He face began to swell up after the seven-hour surgery, and within a few hours was struggling to speak or breath, forcing doctors to operate in order to save her life. She has been warned that her blood is low on platelets, and must endure regular visits to doctors to ensure she is recovering properly but has been allowed to leave the Belgian hospital and is back home in Maidstone, Kent, with her family. Recovery: Maloney wears sunglasses to hide her bruises, and says she looked like she had gone 'ten rounds' with former protégé Lennox Lewis . However, Maloney said she is still determined to have the final operation to become a woman, and is set to have a breast augmentation operation and gender reassignment surgery in February at a private clinic. 'It’s not just a matter of wanting to go through with this. This is something I have to do to correct what was wrong at birth,' she said in a second interview with the Daily Mirror. She said although doctors have told her the complications from her facial surgery have put her around two months behind schedule, this will have no effect on her suitability for surgery. Maloney also rubbished claims her operation had been cancelled because of a reported risk to her heart, and said she is excited for her final surgery. But she said that other transexuals should be given more advice before having their operations. 'It ­probably was vanity that drove me to have so much work done, but there is not enough ­independent advice ­available and too many people travel abroad to have work done in ­environments that they are not familiar with,' she said. Under NHS guidelines, transsexuals have to live as a woman for two years before they are allowed corrective surgery. Private clinics recommend one year to ensure that their patients can cope with the change. In August this year Maloney shocked the macho world of boxing by announcing her decision to change her sex and live as a woman, having retired from the sport in October 2013. Ahead of her surgery, Kellie told Lorraine Kelly that she wanted to have her nose made slightly smaller. 'My youngest daughter told me my nostrils were too big,' she said. 'I was always concerned about my chin but they tell me it's within the female parameters and the gender doctor can do the full operation, hopefully, and breasts in January.' Decision: In August this year Maloney shocked the macho world of boxing by announcing her decision to change her sex and live as a woman . She added: 'I am living really well now, I am pleased that the public are really good to me and my daughters are great. The operation will be the final piece of the jigsaw, then I can start living my life properly. 'Most of my friends are retiring but I am living life all over again.' Kellie is also sharing her story and supporting others within her support group, talking at events and helping other transgender people. She even revealed that she's toying with the idea of getting back into boxing to prove that women can do it too. 'At least it will stop me shopping,' she joked. MailOnline has contacted Ms Maloney's representatives for comment.

Bread and jam, please, Mummy,’ as you’re trying to work out how to carry the TV to the pawn shop, and how to tell him that there is no bread and jam. ‘He does use it as a means to shut down debates, or if anybody says anything about disability he comes out and says: “You can’t say anything about disability,” when actually he doesn’t come from the same place as a lot of parents of disabled children, who may not have the money to afford top of the range healthcare for their kids or might be living in cramped accommodation etc etc, so I do stand by what I said. ‘I didn’t do it in the most sensitive manner but you know Twitter is a fairly limiting place to try to express yourself.’ She added: ‘I regret not thinking about it a bit harder but we all do things that when you look at the next day that you go “I could have done that a bit better, or a bit more sensitively”.’ Sainsbury’s came under pressure from customers who urged the supermarket chain to end its relationship with Miss Monroe. David Webster tweeted: ‘Jack Monroe’s comments regarding David Cameron’s deceased son are deplorable. I hope that @sainsburys reconsider her employment.’ Andrew Havery said: ‘#boycottsainsburys until they get rid of heartless leftist @MsJackMonroe.’ Dwayne Pipe posted: ‘I quite like @sainsburys, but every time I now walk into one of their shops I will be thinking of Jack Monroe’s dead kid tweet. Not good.’ Sainsbury’s issued a statement, saying: ‘Jack Monroe blogs independently. Sainsbury’s is not a political organisation and we certainly don’t share her views.’ A source revealed that the supermarket would no longer be working with the food writer whose contract is to expire in the not too distant future. Grammar school-educated Miss Monroe was branded a hypocrite by those who said she often wrote about her son Johnny in her blog and in other publications. Miss Monroe said she was standing by her comments, which Tory backbenchers branded sick and distasteful . The blog led to a publishing deal and regular stints on the Guardian. Andrew Percy, a Tory member of the Commons health select committee, said: ‘This is not just a distasteful tweet, it is sick. ‘If a Right-Wing politician or columnist had made such a comment, Miss Monroe would be writing hand-wringing columns about how evil or cruel such a comment was.’ Charlotte Leslie, Tory member of the health select committee, added: ‘Anyone of any integrity is left pretty speechless. 'Not only is this incredibly callous and hurtful from someone who is supposed to be in a position of some responsibility, it is also utterly inaccurate.","Jack Monroe hired as face of Sainsbury's ad campaigns against poverty .

"A decorated army veteran renowned for rescuing youths from Islamic State today warned that the terrorist group is placing 'sleeper cells' in European countries including the UK. Dimitri Bontinck, who is known as the 'Jihadi Hunter', spoke out as he prepared to support his own teenage son in a criminal trial after bringing him home from Syria. It came as Home Secretary Theresa May and senior British police chiefs also said that a terrorist atrocity involving an ISIS-style beheading or bomb attack on civilians is now 'almost inevitable'. Referring to their campaign of atrocities carried out abroad, Mr Bontinck, 41, told MailOnline: 'It's not the kids who are the principal danger – it's the chiefs whom you never see in the videos. 'The mature men running this organisation are deeply sinister, and extremely well-funded, and they have European countries such as Britain, France and Belgium in their sights.' Belgian Army veteran Dimitri Bontinck (centre) poses with contacts in war-torn Syria. He has warned that the Islamic State is placing sleepers cells in the UK and other European countries after lisasing with members of Jabhat Al Nusra, a branch of Al Qaeda, and other contacts with close links to ISIS operatives . Some of the contacts Mr Bontinck met in the Syrian town of Al-Hamraa during his missions to find his son . He added: 'Their aim is to take revenge against the west for what they view as an all-out assault on them, and they will strike when they are ready. 'I've been told by very influential sources that they have sleeper cells over here, and are preparing to unleash their war in Europe.' Mr Bontinck, a Belgian national who is based in Antwerp, has completed seven missions to Syria to help rescue his son, 19-year-old Jejoen, along with other youths in the same position. The special forces trained negotiator insists that Jejoen is innocent of any wrongdoing, and that the authorities should not be 'stigmatising and criminalising youngsters who fall in with the wrong crowd'. Jejoen was raised as a Catholic, attending a Jesuit school in Antwerp, but converted to Islam at 15 after going out with a local Muslim girl. He became radicalised under the influence of the now-banned Sharia4Belgium group and then travelled to the Syrian civil war zone after flying to Turkey. Dimitri Bontinck arrives in Turkey (left) in April 2013 on one of seven missions to find his son Jejoen, who he was reunited with in Syria earlier this year (right) Mr Bontinck with his son’s passport – the one which he did not need to travel from Belgium to Syria . Jejoen told his parents – Mr Bontinck and his mother, Rose – that he was 'on holiday with some mates in Holland'. 'He didn't even have a passport to get to Turkey, instead using his Belgium identity card,' said Mr Bontinck, who had to travel to and from Syria three times before finding Jejoen. 'We were both accused of being spies at one stage, and were badly beaten up' said Mr Bontinck, adding: 'But the main thing is that we made excellent contacts with the radicals, as well as other influential players, before getting out.' Mr Bontinck's main dealings were with Jabhat Al Nusra, a branch of Al Qaeda, but he has also spoken to those close to ISIS operatives. His exact movements are shrouded in secrecy, but he has shown MailOnline documents and other evidence which confirm dealings with intelligence agencies and other governmental groups, as well as warring factions. Pictures show Mr Bontinck armed and working with 'my team' out in Syria – a group which includes Arab speakers and those who 'know the country intimately'. He says he has received death threats from ISIS, and believes his son is in 'serious danger', and should be given 'a new identity after offering the authorities a huge amount of information about those who indoctrinated him'.

His exact movements are shrouded in secrecy, but he has shown MailOnline evidence which confirm dealings with intelligence agencies and other governmental groups as well as warring factions . Growing threat: Youngsters learning about radical Islam on the streets of Antwerp in Belgium . Jejoen, who was rescued earlier this year, was held for a time with James Foley, the US journalist who was later murdered, and the Briton John Cantlie, who continues to appear on IS propaganda videos. 'They all knew each other as the three Js', said Mr Bontinck, blaming both American and Britain for 'not working hard enough with the radicals to get their subjects home'. Mr Bontinck has so far helped to bring four other youngsters, beyond Jejoen, back from Syria, and said there were 'too many intelligence agencies who have missed opportunities to rescue hostages.' He helped in an attempt by Khadra Jama, from Manchester, to rescue her twin daughters Zahra and Salma, 16, who have married IS fighters since running away in June. An older brother, Ahmed, was already involved in the conflict, having joined Al Shabab in their parents' native Somalia. Mr Bontinck said a charity worker based in Denmark met one of the sisters near Aleppo after being promised safe passage by an IS commander, but the teenager was not persuaded to leave. This was despite assurances that she could go to Denmark, where the family has connections and where the authorities adopt a more understanding approach to those who return. Jejoen Bontinck with his barrister, Chris Luyckx, back in Antwerp. He and more than 40 others with alleged links to Sharia4Belgium are currently on trial accused of belonging to a terrorist organisation . On a second trip, to meet the second daughter, the charity worker also took the twins' mother. Both were captured and briefly held by IS before being freed, but without fulfilling their mission. 'It's extremely dangerous out there, and of course I fear for my life,' said Mr Bontinck. 'I work with some excellent, people, however. We are a team and we are committed to getting youngsters home. 'My greatest help has come from the French, who are very proactive in getting their people out. They do a lot of their dealings through Qatar.' The massively wealthy Arab country has close links with France despite – controversially – being accused of indirectly funding IS as an enemy of Syrian president Bashar Al-Assad. 'The French are committed to rescuing hostages, in a way which Britain and America are not,' said Mr Bontinck. Mr Bontinck said he 'had no evidence' of cash being used to free hostages, saying 'all I have used is negotiation with the right people.' Proposals for improving the situation offered by Mr Bontinck include an international effort to close down Jihadi websites, and stricter passport controls on young people travelling to Turkey. Jejoen Bontinck, who is suspected of being part of Sharia4Belgium, arrives for his trial  in September . 'These are just simple measures which would make the situation better straight away,' said Mr Bontinck. He insisted 'Jejoen was a victim, just like so many other teenagers and other young people who get caught up in this type of madness. 'These radical Islamic groups are no different from cults. They create a sense of community among young people, and then lead them into terrifying situations.' This week, Mr Bontinck will attend court for the end of a trial in which his son and more than 40 others with alleged links to Sharia4Belgium are accused of belonging to a terrorist organisation. Jejoen has denied any wrongdoing, saying he went out to Syria for humanitarian reasons, and spent a great deal of time locked up. He was also held in prison in Belgium for more than a month on his return, before being freed on stringent bail terms. Prosecutors have demanded a four year jail term for Jejoen – something his father said was 'preposterous'. A 15-year term has been sought against Fouad Belkacem, the Sharia4Belgium spokesman and alleged mastermind of the group.

'We will chop off the heads of whoever you bring': A British ISIS fighter dares west to send ground troops in this video rant. Mr Bontinck has warned that ISIS will strike in the West when they are ready . Belkacem is notorious for posting Jihad recruitment videos online, even though Sharia4Belgium was officially dissolved two years ago. Mr Bontinck, who was twice honoured when part of a UN peace keeping forced in the Balkans in the 1990s, said his son was 'victim, key witness, and terrorist suspect' in the trial. The highly trained former solder is now in demand as a 'Jihadi Hunter' who will travel to some of the most dangerous places in the world to rescue youngsters. Requests have come from numerous countries, including Britain, but he said he was finding it 'increasingly hard to be the Mother Teresa  figure' without more support. 'The Belgian government has no interest at all in doing anything positive, and nor do countries like Britain, so a non-governmental agency is necessary, or at the very least charitable donations. The priority has to be to save our children.' Hendrik van de Velde, the Belgian foreign affairs department spokesman said 'Belgium was the first country to draw attention to the problem' of young men and women being radicalised, adding: 'Belgium also seeks to avoid radicalisation within society through grassroots work at local level.' Jejoen Bontinck has kept his Islamic faith, but has renounced Sharia4Belgium, and now gets on 'extremely well' with both Mr Bontinck and his Nigerian-born wife, Rose. In speeches today, Theresa May and senior police will warn that the 'diverse' terrorist threat posed by jihadis returning from Syria and Iraq is one of the greatest Britain has ever faced. Potential attacks could range from a 'lone wolf' beheading in a crowded shopping centre or street, to a bomb plot using fertiliser stolen from British farms.","Dimitri Bontinck says ISIS chiefs have European countries 'in their sights'

"Marie Curie, Florence Nightingale and Margaret Thatcher have been named as the top three women who have 'changed the world'. The definitive list, which also includes campaigners, royals and authors, was compiled following a poll of 2,000 British adults. Also included were fashion pioneer Coco Chanel, Harry Potter author J. K. Rowling and iconic sex symbol Marilyn Monroe. Pioneer: Marie Curie's work in chemistry made her the first woman ever to win a Nobel Prize, which she then went on to win again before dying of radiation poisoning in 1934 at the age of 66 . Powerful women: The founder of modern nursing Florence Nightingale (left) and Britain's only ever female Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher (right) came second and third in the list respectively . Curie, who died from radiation exposure in 1934 at the age of 66, came top. Her pioneering work in chemistry made her the first woman ever to win a Nobel Prize, which she then went on to win again. Hailed as the founder of modern nursing, 'Lady of the Lamp' Florence Nightingale, who passed away in 1910 aged 90, came second. Britain's first and only female Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, who died in April 2013 aged 87, rounded off the top three. The 'Iron Lady' led the Conservative party for 15 years and was known for her uncompromising approach to politics. Suffragette leader Emmeline Pankhurst was voted fourth place and the revered Mother Teresa came fifth. British royals featured highly with Princess Diana (sixth place) receiving more votes than long-serving monarchs Queen Victoria (seventh), Queen Elizabeth I (10th) and Queen Elizabeth II (12th). The Duchess of Cambridge also made the top 40 featuring in 36th place. People's princess: Royal charity stalwart Princess Diana was voted sixth ahead of long-serving monarchs . Way with words: Harry Potter author J. K. Rowling (left) got generations of children reading, while Anne Frank's (right) diary of her time hiding from the Nazi made the horror of the Holocaust real for millions . Influential: TV host and the first black woman billionaire ever Oprah Winfrey is 26th on the list . The writing of Anne Frank gave a moving commentary on the war through one little girl's diary until her tragic death in 1945 and sees her placed inside the top 10. When quizzed on the common characteristics of the women in the list, the fact that so many were unafraid to challenge the beliefs of their time was the thing admired most. Rosa Parks' refusal to give up her seat on a bus launched a revolution in human civil rights in 1955 featured in 11th, while former Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi came 13th. The adventurer Amelia Earhart flies in at 14th, while Harry Potter scribe J.K. Rowling also appears inside the top 20, as do Marilyn Monroe and Jane Austen. Media mogul Oprah Winfrey's power is clearly recognised and sees her appear among the women who changed the world, alongside Hillary Clinton and youngest ever Nobel prize recipient, Malala Yousafzai. However, only a third of those polled felt there were enough inspirational figures for today's younger generation. In fact, a resounding eight in ten felt young women idolise modern celebrities far too much. The research was commissioned to mark the return of Sky Arts' hit comedy series Psychobitches, the satirical show which playfully delves into the minds of some of history's most influential and iconic women. A spokeswoman for Sky Arts said: 'There's no doubt that the women on this list changed the world and continue to inspire people today. 'These characters - and all the women in the series - offer us a light-hearted look at what these incredible women might have confessed on the psychiatrist's couch, given the chance.'

The NSW Rural Fire Service (RFS) reports that it is battling 90 blazes so far, 47 of which are deemed out of control. Most were caused by lightning strikes late on Sunday that followed scorching temperatures in Sydney and around the state, NSW RFS spokesman Ben Shepherd said. The Bureau of Meteorology reported that the unsettled conditions were being caused by a slow-moving low-pressure trough, with forecast of storms in southern and western parts of the state. Peter Zmijewski, senior meteorologist at Bureau of Meteorology, told Daily Mail Australia that the high temperatures were not unseasonal but because of the changing seasons. He said: 'This time of the year it’s a transition in the season and there are a lot of adjustments going on, this is why we can experience very hot and cold in the same day.' The November to January temperature outlooks indicate a warmer than normal season for both daytime and night-time temperatures across most of Australia.

Famous client: Kaplan has been representing Collins, 67, in his contentious divorce from estranged wife Faye Grant (left) The attorney made a name for himself by representing Kevin Federline in his 2007 divorce from pop star Britney Spears after two years of marriage. Kaplan also took on Chris Judd as a client following his breakup from Jennifer Lopez in 2002. Most recently, Kaplan was hired by actor and alleged child molester Stephen Collins to represent him in his contentious divorce from Faye Grant. Kaplan, who has been practicing family law for 40 years, has accused Grant of doing everything in her power to destroy her estranged husband's reputation in an effort to reach a more favorable settlement for herself, including leaking a damaging secret recording made during a therapy session in 2012. The explosive tape, which was released in October, featured Collins, 67, confessing to sexually abusing young girls. He has not been charged with any crime. Ladies' man: Kaplan, pictured left with a mystery blonde out on the town in 2008, and right with his client Pamela Bach, David Hasselhoff's ex-wife, in 2007 . Grant, 57, has repeatedly denied leaking the recording to TMZ. She has claimed that she only handed over the tape to police for investigative purposes after her husband refused to seek treatment. The couple's divorce trial has been delayed until January 5 after Grant's lawyer, Larry Ginsberg, dropped her as a client two weeks ago due to an alleged disagreement over attorney's fees. The trial would determine how the couple divide their assets, and how much spousal support Grant should receive. Kaplan said earlier this month that his client has spent $1million already on attorneys' and experts' fees in the case, and the delay in the proceedings would probably him another $200,000. Collins has lost several TV and film roles as a result of the scandal surrounding the leaked tape, including a $75,000 part in the upcoming comedy Ted 2. Ugly breakup: Kaplan and Collins (right) have accused Grant of leaking to the press a secret recording made during a therapy session in which the actor admitted to molesting young girls . The actor is best known for playing a well-meaning pastor and father of seven in the family-friendly TV series 7th Heaven that aired between 1996 and 2007. Faye Grant, who is also an actress, stated in court filings that she had been forced to put her career on hold during her marriage to Collins.

"One of hate preacher Anjem Choudary’s top henchmen today boasted about how 'Allah made a mockery of British intelligence' after he was able to skip bail and flee to Syria because of police blunders. Siddhartha Dhar, 31, disappeared less than 24 hours after being freed on police bail by Scotland Yard detectives investigating Choudary’s inner circle in September. They asked him to surrender his passport under strict conditions designed to prevent him promoting al-Muhajiroun, the banned extremist group founded by the fanatic preacher. Scroll down for video . Siddhartha  Dhar, circled, disappeared only 24 hours after being released on police bail, the follower of Anjem Choudary, centre, took a coach to Paris with his family before travelling on to Syria . Taunt: Dhar - who goes by the name of Abu Rumaysah - apparently tweeted these messages on Monday . But instead, the Islamic convert, known as Abu Rumaysah, took a coach from London to Paris and headed to the Islamic State war zone with his young family. Today a series of tweets were sent from an account which appears to be his. He said: 'My Lord (Allah) made a mockery of British intelligence and surveillance. Make hijrah (flight) Muslims. Place your trust in Allah.' He said: 'What a shoddy security system Britain must have to allow me to breeze through Europe to the Islamic State.' In his first of a series of tweets praising ISIS, he said on Monday: 'Alhamdulillah (all praise be to Allah), that He (and only He) facilitated a path for me and my family to live in the Islamic State.' There is no independent proof of whether Dhar really is with ISIS in Syria - but his boasts are sure to infuriate critics who were outraged at the time that Dhar was allowed to slip through the grasp of police so easily. Dhar, a darling of TV interviewers repeatedly given a platform on the BBC to promote his radical views, had publicly stated that he wanted to live under the Islamic State. Just weeks before his arrest, he told one interviewer that he was willing to renounce his British citizenship if it meant he was allowed to travel. He was a key member of al-Muhajiroun and offshoot groups such as the Shariah Project, masterminding ‘roadshows’ in London that aimed to recruit troubled youngsters to Islam. It was at one of these that he is believed to have met, and possibly mentored, Michael Adebolajo, one of the murderers of Fusilier Lee Rigby. Dhar and nine other men, including Choudary, were held in raids in London and the Midlands in September on suspicion of supporting al-Muhajiroun. Dhar was among  nine men including Choudary, right, held and questioned by police in September . They were also questioned on suspicion of encouraging terrorism before being released on bail and ordered to return to police stations in December. Police wanted to impose strict bail conditions to prevent them associating with each other, promoting extremism or going overseas. But Dhar fled to Syria with his wife and four young children the day after he was released. The details emerged at a recent bail hearing at Westminster Magistrates’ Court in which Choudary and other suspects demanded the return of their identity documents. Asked why Dhar was not in court, prosecutor Luke Ponte said he boarded a coach for Paris on September 27. He said: ‘He failed to comply with the conditions to surrender his travel documents to police. It’s my understanding that he is no longer in the jurisdiction and that he is currently in Syria.’ The court refused to hand back the identity documents. Former shadow home secretary David Davis said at the time that it ‘beggars belief’ that Dhar could escape so easily. 'To allow him to surrender his own passport, rather than take it off him, seems at best careless and at worse a terrible error of judgment,' he added.","Siddhartha Dhar was arrested in September with eight other men .

"Britain's privatised water firms have ‘abused’ loopholes in the law to dodge more than £1billion in tax since the election. A dossier of shame reveals nine water companies, seven of which are foreign owned, have racked up operating profits totalling £10billion since 2010 but paid just £541million in tax. This equates to a tax rate of just 5.3 per cent. Corporation tax on operating profit is normally 23 per cent. Down the drain: The Treasury has missed out on £1billion i tax from utility firms, it has been claimed . At the same time, two of the country’s . biggest energy firms, also foreign-owned, made combined profits of . £1.7billion but paid no tax at all. Meanwhile soaring utility bills have . left millions feeling the pinch. Average water bills have gone up by . 14.5 per cent, while electricity bills have soared by 24.8 per cent and . gas bills by 33.9 per cent. The average family has seen its annual utility bills rise by £384. The revelations are embarrassing for David Cameron who has pledged to clamp down on tax avoidance by multinationals. The details were revealed to the . Commons by Tory MP Charlie Elphicke, a tax lawyer, who called on . ministers to force water and power firms to cut their bills if they . continued to avoid paying tax. There is no suggestion that the firms . involved have broken the law, and they all deny wrongdoing. But Mr . Elphicke said the scale of the tax avoidance was staggering. ‘Foreign-owned utility companies, . particularly in the water industry, have been engaging in tax schemes . using debt interest to avoid tax, which on my calculation over the last . three years indicates that the Exchequer has lost £1billion,’ he said. He went on: ‘They should either be subject to a windfall tax or reduce customers’ bills.’ Friendly fire: The revelations to the Commons by Tory backbench MP Charlie Elphicke, left, a lawyer, are embarrassing for David Cameron, right, who has pledged to clamp down on tax avoidance by multinationals . Mr Elphicke told MPs that the firms . were ‘abusing’ generous tax reliefs that allow companies to offset debt . interest payments against tax. He said firms were borrowing huge sums . off subsidiaries and sister companies, sometimes in tax havens, and then . offsetting the interest payments against tax. He singled out Yorkshire Water as an . ‘especially egregious’ example, saying the giant, which is owned by an . international consortium, had generated £990million in operating profits . over the last three years, yet managed to bank a net tax credit worth . £46.2million. Southern Water, which is also owned by . an international consortium, paid net tax of £45.9million on profits . totalling £767million in the last few years. Foreign-owned Anglian Water . generated operating profits of £1.4billion over the period, but paid . tax of just under £125million. Mr Elphicke accused energy firms of . exploiting similar practices. He said EDF, which is owned by the French . government, made £268.4million in interest payments to group companies, . potentially avoiding £70million in tax. And German-owned Npower made . £358million in interest payments, saving a potential £93million in tax. Mr Elphicke called for tax relief to be removed from interest payments to group companies to help curb the abuse. Feeling the pinch: Average water bills have gone up by 14.5 per cent, while electricity bills have soared by 24.8 per cent and gas bills by 33.9 per cent, meaning the average family's utility costs are up £384 . The nine water firms examined by Mr Elphicke were: . The nine firms represent most of the major water companies, although a large number of small firms take the total for England and Wales to 27. Richard Murphy, of Tax Research UK, . said lax UK rules meant avoiding tax was ‘as easy as taking candy from a . baby’ for multinationals. ‘There are several serious problems with the . system which leads it wide open to abuse,’ he said. Earlier this month it emerged that . Australian-owned Thames Water paid no tax last year despite racking up . pre-tax profits of £145million.

"To go free? The application follows a lacklustre prosecution case against Dewani (pictured during his trial last month . Lawyers for Shrien Dewani have launched an application to have his murder trial thrown out of court, paving the way for him to fly back to Britain a free man. The application follows a lacklustre prosecution case against Dewani which has produced little or no concrete evidence linking the 34-year-old businessman to the honeymoon murder of his 28-year-old wife, Anni, four years ago. The state's case – that Dewani recruited a taxi driver to organise the fatal shooting disguised as a carjacking in a rough township – struggled to gain traction during the testimonies of 16 witnesses following a string of successful rulings in favour of the defence. A central plank of the prosecution case - that Dewani led a secret gay life that motivated him to want to be out of his new marriage - fell away on day one of his South African trial last month following a dramatic admission that he was a 'bi-sexual' who had paid gay prostitutes, frequented clubs and surfed 'hook up' sites to satisfy his sexual urges. And today, defence lawyer Francois van Zyl opened his application by slamming the state's 'sole witness' to Dewani's alleged role in his wife's murder as 'lacking in credibility'. Taxi driver Zola Tongo was, according to the prosecution, recruited by Dewani to organise hitmen to a fake carjacking as the cover for his wife's death. Mr van Zyl asked the Judge - who will alone rule on whether to clear Dewani - to agree that his client could not be convicted on the strength of what the driver told the court - testimony of 'such poor quality it cannot be reliable,' Mr van Zyl said. 'Tongo is the pillar on which the state's case is built. If that fails, the whole state's case fails with it,' he told the Western Cape high Court. He added that there was no doubt that there was a conspiracy targeting Mrs Dewani, but asked: 'Was the accused part of this agreement? What were the terms of this agreement? 'The mere fact that yes, there was a hikacking, the lady was robbed ... the question is, was the accused part and parcel of this conspiracy?. 'This (application) will stand or fall with Tongo's evidence.' Little evidence: Defence lawyers say the prosecution case has produced little or no concrete evidence linking the 34-year-old businessman to the honeymoon murder of his 28-year-old wife, Anni, four years ago (pictured together before Anni's tragic death) After dismissing Tongo's statements to police and evidence to the court as 'riddled with contradictions', Mr van Zyl moved on to the incredibility of the story that Dewani had hired him to kill someone within minutes of meeting him. 'How probable is it that this foreigner would arrive in this country and within half an hour asks him (tongo) to find a hitman to kill someone?' Mr van Zyl asked the court. 'This is one of two or three huge improbabilities - which cannot be irrelevant.' Mr van Zyl referred to CCTV footage of the newlyweds kissing and posing for photographs at the Cape Grace hotel as they waited for Tongo to collect them on the night Mrs Dewani was killed. 'We ask ourselves how probable it is that this man knowing that this person he is kissing will be dead within an hour,' he said. Dewani has spent the last few days meeting his family and legal team at the high-security psychiatric hospital, where he has been held since his extradition from Britain in April, to agree a strategy for the end of his trial. In the best possible outcome for him, Judge Jeanette Traverso could clear him of all charges and free to board a plane back to Britain within days. Upbeat: Dewani has spent the last few days meeting his family and legal team at the high-security psychiatric hospital, where he has been held since his extradition from Britain in April, to agree a strategy for the end of his trial . Fighting charges: Dewani was pictured moving boxes inside the Valkenberg hospital, Cape Town yesterday and appreaded also to have a pair of boxing gloves . Even if the judge, who sits with two assessors and no jury, does concur with the prosecution that the trial should run its course – Dewani may still not have to face tough questioning in the witness box. His legal team are entitled to call no witnesses in Dewani's defence – only give their closing argument - and the judge could still rule that there is insufficient evidence before the court on which to convict him 'beyond reasonable doubt'. The public gallery was packed for the unusual application brought on day 23 of the high-profile trial. The families of both Dewani and his dead wife were also in court, as they have been every day of his trial. Dewani looked particularly animated as his lawyer introduced five themes of arguments in support of his application. His eyes darted between Mr van Zyl, the judge and the three benches filled with reporters.","Application follows  lacklustre prosecution that has produced little evidence .

"Rodley bought his manorial title at auction in 1986 . A self-styled peer dubbed the 'Lord of Fraud' who once planned the world's biggest bank raid has been ordered to pay back £1.2m to the victims of his investment scam or face even longer in prison. 'Lord' Hugh Rodley, 67, was jailed for seven years in 2012 for fleecing up to 600 pensioners out of £6million with the promise of 'rich rewards' in return for them investing their life savings. The fraudster, who used his ill gotten gains to splash out on a chauffeur driven Rolls Royce and a £2million mansion in Gloucestershire, has now been ordered to repay £1.2million to his victims. If he fails to repay the money in six months he must serve another seven years in prison. Andy Archibald, Deputy Director of the NCA's National Cyber Crime Unit, said: 'Rodley's criminality funded a lavish lifestyle, but our investigations do not end when a criminal is put in jail. 'Money is at the heart of all organised crime and is the motivation for most criminals, so we are determined to take their profits off them. 'The clock is ticking for Rodley to hand over the money he made from this enterprise. Rodley, along with several accomplices, targeted the elderly and sold them worthless shares in a boiler room scam. The gang had drawn up a 'sucker list' of targets, detailing people who had already invested in some shares. They then used high pressure sales techniques to trick these people into handing over money to invest in firms they claimed would be floated on the stock market. They claimed these firms handled 'exotic' and 'fail-safe' projects such as land development in Europe and Asia. However none of the firms were ever floated and the investors lost thousands to the fraudsters. One 87-year-old man lost more than £800,000. Rodley, along with accomplices Julian Silver, 45, Adam Corbett, 34, and Sonny Willis, 31, were found guilty of running the scam between 2004 and 2007 after a trial at Southwark Crown Court in 2012. Simon Farrell, prosecuting, said the four men had been involved in the 'dishonest extraction of several million pounds' from investors. Self-styled lord Hugh Rodley has been ordered to repay £1.2m in six months or face another seven years in prison after he was found guilty in 2012 of fleecing hundreds of pensioners out of their life savings in a scam . Victims were told they would quickly make 'handsome profits' when the companies were floated on the Alternative Investment Market. 'This type of trick involving the dishonest selling of worthless shares is colloquially known as a boiler room fraud,' said Mr Farrell. 'The term is used to describe high pressure sales techniques often targeting elderly and vulnerable victims. 'A large number of victims in this case were subjected to high pressure sells and repeated calls until they agreed to invest. 'One 87-year-old gentleman unfortunately parted with £828,000 investing in most of the companies. 'Many of the elderly victims are not fools by any stretch of the imagination; they are all successful, responsible individuals who eventually gave in to sales patter. 'Those who agreed to invest were almost always sent a contract setting out the amount of shares they agreed to, the price per share and a letter providing details of how their share made payment.' Mr Farrell said none of the victims received any return on their investment as most of the companies appeared to do little or no trading at all. At the heart of the scam was a 'floor book' - a list of more than 1,000 investors, of whom 600 handed over cash to the fraudsters. The document was seized after being discovered on Rodley's computer when his Tewkesbury property was searched following his arrest. Mr Farrell added: 'The floor book records around £6million worth of investment and marks as received a figure in the region of £3million. 'But what the bank accounts show is what was actually received that can in fact be traced back to the floor book - around £2.7million. Sonny Willis (left), Julian Silver (centre) and Adam Corbett (right) were found guilty of running the boiler room scam along with Rodley, which saw them steal £6m and defraud hundreds of pensioners out of their savings . 'The defendants used so-called sucker lists, detailing people with small shareholdings, and started phoning people up offering shares in exotic land development buildings in Europe and Asia and water desalination projects.' The group defrauded their victims through companies including World Aqua Tech PLC, ART IT PLC, Mediatel PLC, BMHC PLC, European Land Development Agency PLC, and Eurowaste Recycling PLC, between January 1, 2005 and June 30, 2007. Mr Farrell said the invested money passed through the bank accounts either of the fraudsters, or accounts controlled by them. Phillip Dennett, 44, was cleared of involvement in the fraud but found guilty of laundering the proceeds along with the others. Rodley, a father of three, was born Brian McGough in Ireland in 1947 and bought his manorial title at auction in 1986. During his trial he claimed he was not part of any plot to con investors and told jurors he did not act dishonestly. In 2010 Rodley was jailed for eight years for an extraordinary plot to steal £229m from a Japanese bank in one of the biggest ever cyber crimes of its kind. The plan to plunder Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation in 2004, failed at the last minute after the bungling computer boffins inputted the wrong codes. Rodley was jailed for eight years for his part in the plot to steal £229 from a Japanese bank, which would have been the biggest cyber crime in history . During his trial he was accused of trying to pass off fake cheques worth £45,120 and £35,399 and trying to defraud his co-conspirator David Nash by using his identity to spend £27,000 on credit cards . The plot unravelled when two expert hackers made a mistake as they tried to transfer money from the bank to 10 accounts in other countries. This failed and they returned the next day to attempt more transfers but these also failed because they had made an error in filling in the wire transfer information boxes. Eventually a complex paper trail of accounts they were supposed to transfer to led to Rodley, Nash, Bernard Davies and Inger Britt Marie Malmros - a Swedish national who was cleared of all charges. Davies died before the trial. The men fronted companies used for illegal money laundering. Rodley became nervous when he had not heard about the cash and went to Cheltenham to send a fax to a bank in Dubai asking for the money. It was not there and Rodley was eventually arrested by detectives. The two hackers - Jan Van Osselaer from Belgium and Gilles Poelvoorde from France, admitted a charge of conspiracy to steal. Rodley was convicted of conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy to transfer criminal property. The self-styled lord said he believed Willis and Corbett were legitimate businessmen looking to help promote two of his companies, Mediatel and Eurowaste Recycling. Melonie Moody, from the City of London's Asset Recovery Team, said: 'Our investigation uncovered how Rodley, Willis, Corbett and Silver preyed on ordinary, hard-working people and tricked them into investing their lifesavings in worthless shares.' Rodley, of Gloucestershire, was jailed in 2012 for the crime. At the time he was already serving an eight year prison sentence at the time for  plotting to steal £229m from a Japanese bank in one of the biggest ever cyber crimes of its kind. He must now pay £1,236,736 within six months of face another seven years in prison. Willis, of  Billericay, Essex, must pay £249,950 within six months or face another two and a half years in jail. Silver, of  Hinx Hill, Ashford, Kent, must repay £1 as he has no available assets, or face another day in prison. Corbett, of Camberley, Surrey, must fork out £528.65 or serve an additional two weeks in prison. They were all convicted of conspiracy to defraud and were alleged to have committed this with Bernard Davies, who died before the trial.","Lord Hugh Rodley has been ordered to repay £1.2m to victims of his scam .

"A glass pane at Tower Bridge's new transparent walkway 140ft above the River Thames, has smashed after a visitor dropped a bottle of beer. Just two weeks after the new attraction opened, one of the six half-tonne glass panes that make up the floor, was damaged by visitors. The dropped bottle of beer caused an initial crack, but a woman walking over the broken glass in stiletto heels reportedly caused the pane to shatter further. Scroll down for video . Peter Gordon tweeted an image of a smashed glass pane at the Tower Bridge following the accident on Friday . The glass walkway opened to great fanfare two weeks ago, showing an unusual new view of London . Visitor Peter Gordon tweeted an image of the broken pane, writing: 'Was in tower bridge walkway today, someone dropped a beer bottle; this happened.' Officials at the attraction have rushed to reassure visitors, stating that the broken glass was just a 'sacrificial' layer. The transparent walkway is made up of five layers of glass in each pane and it was just the top one which was damaged. The glass platform stretches across Tower Bridge Exhibition's high-level walkways – nearly 140ft above the River Thames . However, Tower Bridge head Chris Earlie told ITV: 'We are gutted it's happened in the first couple of weeks when it's been open to the public but it's completely safe. 'We should have said no glass on the glass section of the floor. It was a bit shortsighted of us.' The top layer was designed to be easily replaceable in the event of scratches or damage and the attraction remained open despite the shattered pane. Following the incident on Friday night, the cracked pane was then covered with a mat for the remainder of the weekend, with a plan for it to be repaired on Sunday night. Peter Gordon was at an event when he spotted the smashed pane in the walkway . The new attraction has opened at the top section of Tower Bridge, 140ft over the River Thames . One half of the £1million walkway opened to the public two weeks ago between the north and south towers of the bridge and will be joined on December 1 by a parallel walk alongside it. They have been designed to give tourists, sightseers and thrill-seekers a unique view from a bridge that bills itself as the most famous in the world, not forgetting a peek at the workings of a legendary feat of engineering when the bridge below opens. Each glass panel along the 36ft walkway is getting on for three inches thick and weighs nearly 1,200lb. Tower Bridge Exhibition executives insist the idea is to enthral rather that scare people, simply offering a different view of the city.","Pane of glass smashed after bottle was dropped by visitor .

"The true scale of tax credit benefits for EU migrants to Britain is revealed today – amid warnings that it is turning this country into a ‘honeypot nation’. Figures published last night by the Open Europe think-tank make clear how taxpayers are subsidising low-wage migrant workers. A migrant worker with two children earning the minimum wage sees their basic income of less than £200 a week propped up with an additional £330 in tax credits and other benefits. MPs Keith Vaz and Mark Reckless greet an Eastern European migrant on January 1, the day temporary restrictions were limited . An average worker from Spain coming to Britain will see their weekly wage go up by nearly half compared to what they would earn at home. A worker from Poland can double their basic pay and new arrivals from Bulgaria will increase their pay by 250 per cent. Senior Tory MP Bernard Jenkin said: ‘We’ve become a honeypot nation in the European Union, which is why we’ve done well controlling immigration by non-EU countries, but that has been offset by quite a dramatic increase in immigration from EU countries. ‘One of the things that’s keeping low pay suppressed is the endless supply of cheap labour coming in from the EU8, the Eastern European countries, the recent entrants to the European Union which has really changed the whole equation. ‘And most people come to this country unaccompanied by their families, but they’re able to claim benefits to support their families back home.’ Mr Jenkin said migrant numbers were ‘causing real problems in hospitals, in schools, in provision of public services, shortage of housing’. The Open Europe figures emerged as the row over the Government’s migration target continued. It was sparked at the weekend when Theresa May admitted David Cameron was unlikely to meet his pledge to cut net migration – the difference between those arriving and those leaving – to the tens of thousands by May. The Home Secretary said the promise had been ‘blown off course’ by a higher-than expected influx from the EU. Senior Tory MP Bernard Jenkin said: 'We’ve become a honeypot nation in the European Union' Yesterday, a Downing Street spokesman insisted cutting net migration to the tens of thousands remains the Prime Minister’s objective – while Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said the promise was ‘pretty stupid’. The Open Europe figures show that in Spain, the average weekly take-home pay after tax for a single parent with two children is £362; in Poland it is £269 and in Bulgaria £149. In Britain, a worker on the minimum wage would earn £196, but that is increased by tax credits and other benefits to £527. It means workers moving to the UK from Spain see their earnings go up 45 per cent, from Poland by 95 per cent and from Bulgaria by a staggering 253 per cent. Open Europe said cutting tax credits was necessary to preserve free movement which was beneficial to Britain’s economy. It suggests refusing tax credits and some other benefits payments to migrant workers for up to five years. Tax credits were introduced by Gordon Brown to top up the incomes of low-earning families, particularly those with children. Families can claim up to £10,000 a year. The most significant other benefit received by migrant workers is child benefit of £20.55 for the first child and an extra £13.55 for each additional child. EU migrant workers are also potentially entitled to housing benefit. Overall, Britain spends £5billion a year on tax credits for migrant workers, with 415,000 foreign nationals benefiting from the perk. Witold Sobkow, the Polish ambassador to the UK, said refusing Polish citizens tax credits when working in Britain would be discriminatory under EU law. He added: ‘We pay the same taxes which pay for tax credits doing the same job. ‘So imagine you have three people working for the BBC – one from Spain, one from Poland and one from the UK; they live here, they pay taxes here. Why should you discriminate against the Spanish and the Polish worker?’ Mr Sobkow said plans were being drawn up to encourage 2,300 doctors and nurses trained in Poland but working in Britain to return home. ‘Of course we want them back,’ he said. ‘They were educated in Poland for free so we want them. We are doing our best to create conditions so that they could come back and work in Poland.’","Open Europe figures show taxpayers are subsiding low-wage migrants .

"Withering: Lord Rennard has questioned whether Nick Clegg is still leading a ‘major party’ following his latest by-election humiliation . Lord Rennard has questioned whether Nick Clegg is still leading a ‘major party’ following his latest by-election humiliation. The former chief executive of the Liberal Democrats said the party’s rock-bottom showing in last week’s Rochester poll – where it came fifth with less than 1 per cent of the vote – was ‘unacceptable’. And he warned that the latest failure makes the chances of the Lib Dems holding on to dozens of seats at the next general election much harder. Lord Rennard’s barbed accusation that the Lib Dems are now just a minor party will be seen as revenge on Mr Clegg for not allowing him back into the heart of the party. The Lib Dem peer, who was the party’s chief executive between 2003 and 2009, was suspended early this year after a series of women accused him of making sexual advances. He denied the allegations, but issued an apology for encroaching on some of the women’s ‘personal space’. In August the suspension was controversially lifted – although he was told he would have no role in next year’s election campaign. Last week the Lib Dem candidate in Rochester and Strood, Geoff Juby, recorded the worst result of any major party since the war, garnering just 0.9 per cent of the vote and coming fifth behind the Greens. Ukip’s Mark Reckless won the seat. A month before, the Lib Dem candidate in Clacton polled just 1.3 per cent of the vote; and last year in South Shields the Lib Dems got 1.4 per cent. Lord Rennard – who notched up a string of by-election victories as strategy chief in the 1990s – made his comments in a blog on Facebook, entitled Reflections on Rochester. Lord Rennard’s barbed accusation that the Lib Dems are now just a minor party will be seen as revenge on Mr Clegg for not allowing him back into the heart of the party . He said the ‘result was not in my opinion unavoidable’. He added: ‘We should not allow such a result ever again, because polling the lowest vote of any major party, in any by-election ever, casts doubt on our status as a “major party”.’ Lord Rennard also criticised those in the Lib Dems who fail to grasp the enormity of the crisis engulfing the party by suggesting ‘we have been here before’. ‘No we haven’t,’ he said. ‘Not in terms of parliamentary by-elections in England anyway.’ He added: ‘To avoid such results as Rochester again, the party must change its approach to such by-elections, and to all the various sets of elections in which we need to try and sustain our support and build again for the future.’ Nick Clegg has hinted that he would be prepared to form a three-party Coalition of Labour, the Lib Dems and the Scottish Nationalists. The surge in support for the SNP north of the border has prompted speculation that a ‘rainbow coalition’ made up of several parties may be needed after next May’s poll. Analysis of polling data yesterday predicted neither Labour nor the Tories will be able to secure enough seats to govern with one other party. It suggested any government would need two other parties for a majority. Mr Clegg ruled out doing a deal with Ukip leader Nigel Farage, but declined to give a similar declaration about the SNP.","Lord Rennard questions whether Nick Clegg is still leading a 'major party'

"One man has died and two dozen people have been hospitalised after a tour bus crashed and flipped onto its roof off a northern California interstate. This was the second time in one day the bus was involved in an incident, after crashing into a  Denny's restaurant in Red Bluff, 50 miles from the second crash site. The bus was enroute from Los Angeles to Pasco, Washington, when it went off Interstate 5 early this morning. Fatal accident: A 33-year-old man died in the crash and six people remain in hospital with critical or serious injuries after the incident in northern California . Six people were left with critical or serious injuries after the crash, which took place about 7.30am, around 100 miles south of the Oregon border. The identity of the 33-year-old man from Parlier near Fresno, who was killed in the crash remains withheld until his relatives have been informed. Three patients remain are in critical condition, including one who was flown by helicopter to Mercy Medical Center in Mount Shasta with severe head injuries, hospital spokeswoman Joyce Zwanziger told the Sacramento Bee. Three others are in serious condition at the same hospital's Redding location. The two dozen others who were treated at hospitals had mostly minor injuries and were released. The bus, a 1996 Vanhool, was driven by Jose Victor Garcilazo, 67, of Los Angeles. The bus was enroute from Los Angeles to Pasco, Washington, when it went off Interstate 5 early this morning . The bus had already crashed into a restaurant 50 miles down the road that morning, but no one was injured . Cause of crash: Police say drivers fatigue may have been a factor in both crashes . Injuries: Aside from the casualty and the six seriously injured, two dozen others who were treated at hospitals, but had mostly minor injuries and were released . Investigators said evidence at both crash sites show that driver fatigue may have been a factor. They did not say whether drugs or alcohol may have been involved or whether any citations or charges were planned. It wasn't clear how much damage was done in the initial crash or why the bus continued on its trip. Red Bluff police, who investigated the first crash, had no additional information on it Sunday night. The bus operator, Yellow Arrow LLC, is based in Othello, Washington. It has a current license and before Sunday had no reported accidents in the past two years, according to federal records. The hospital was working with the Salvation Army and the Red Cross to assist patients who had been released, many of whom were staying at a hospitality house run by the medical center.

"At 206kg and only 20 years old Nathan Meola was the youngest and heaviest person to audition for The Biggest Loser. But he didn't make the cut in the final stages for the weight loss reality show and the devastating news caused Nathan to spiral into a deep depression. He had pinned every bit of hope he had left on being a contestant to drop the excessive kilos he had struggled with since he was a child growing up in Padstow, in southwest Sydney. But he slowly overcame the setback and shed an astounding 80kg over the next five years and has maintained his 125kg ripped body for the past three years. Now 28 years old and working as a personal trainer - Nathan is living proof to his clients that anything is possible without taking extreme measures. The trainer has hit out at the reality show on his blog comparing it to a 'Japanese game show.' Scroll down for video . The photo that Nathan sent through to The Biggest Loser TV show that landed him an audition - he was 206kg . Nathan works out for an hour six days a week in between training his clients . He slowly overcame the setback of not getting onto the show and shed an astounding 80kg over five years and has maintained his 125kg ripped body for the past three years . Nathan grew a great passion for fitness . Nathan said he didn't know why he used to turn to food for comfort but it's all he's ever known. 'It wasn't the food I was addicted to but the act of eating - it was like mental rewards going off in my brain,' he told Daily Mail Australia. Nathan had weight-loss surgery at 18 years-old, the year before he auditioned for The Biggest Loser in 2006, which involved a gastric band inserted to reduce the amount he ate. He lost 40kg in six months but said the surgery 'doesn't work just like diets'. So when Nathan applied for the TV show - he was determined this was the break he had been looking for. But his world came crashing down around him when the casting agent called with the bad news as he was halfway through an assignment at university. 'She wished me all the best with my weight loss and told me to contact her should I need anything,' he said. 'I was devastated. All my life I’d been too fat, now at this moment I felt like I wasn’t fat enough. I felt like a failure.' 'All of the happily ever after pictures that had been running through my mind shattered into a million pieces. I would have to say that was the most heart broken I’d ever been in my life.' 'I left uni and cried for the entire day. I never finished that assessment, I failed that subject and almost failed the entire semester. I look back on that day now as my sliding door moment.' Nathan quit his job in IT sales and studied as a personal trainer in 2011 . No regrets: Nathan dropped the weight on his own . Nathan then stayed at about 200kg for the next four years. It wasn't until 2010 when he went to a weight loss retreat in the Hawkesbury, about 50km north of Sydney, for four weeks that his life began to transform and he never looked back. 'It was a great experience and the beginning of my changes,' he said. 'It was the first time I learnt any kind of sustained exercise and it helped me develop a passion for fitness.' His passion for exercise became so strong that he studied as a personal trainer the following year. He also quite his job in IT insurance and worked part time at a health food store. 'I trained with people who inspired me and created an environment around me of people who motivated me so it wasn't hard to be healthy everyday.' Following his success story, Nathan wrote a scathing blog about The Biggest Loser saying contestants 'can’t come out of an experience like that and just be ok'. 'Deep emotional and mental issues that caused the eating addiction in the first place are just brushed aside, replaced by the distraction of the competition, the thrill of potentially life changing prize money, and the promise of dramatic weight loss, combined with the ultimate accountability, cameras broadcasting you to an entire nation,' he says in his blog. Nathan said feels like a completely different person from his heftier days . H added that the show was not about telling the success stories of people achieving their goals. 'If that were the case then it wouldn’t be a glorified Japanese game show,' his blog said. 'Contestants wouldn’t be forced to compete against each other in weigh- ins, you wouldn’t have survivor style vote offs, you wouldn’t reward for extreme weight loss and punish for weight gain.' Nathan said he has met former contestants and seen first hand the toll it had taken on them. 'I’m not sure of the percentage but I know that the majority of the contestants have struggled to maintain their weight once leaving the show,' he said. He then refers in his blog to a 2008 contestant Andrew Costello who claims that about 75 per cent of the contestants from that series were back at their starting weight. Nathan told Daily Mail Australia a female contestant from the show joined him at the weight-loss retreat in 2010. 'She was  really struggling with weight at the time, he said. 'She had put all of the weight back on - plus more - and is now left with even more damage to try to clear up than she when she started.' Nathan (centre) still indulges in fast food including pizza, burger and fries when he feels like it . Nathan lives with no regrets saying that not being rejected for the show meant that he had to learn to change his lifestyle without support. 'I had to take the time to fail over and over and over again. I had to get comfortable with how long it takes, and I had to slowly cultivate an environment that supports a healthy life,' he said . 'Most importantly I had to learn about balance, integrating health and fitness seamlessly into my life to create sustainability. Although he admits it was a tough road and there was a lot more to turning his life around than 'cutting out Macca's and getting a gym membership' - he still indulges when he likes. 'Now that  I work out six days a week including weight training three to four times a week - I can eat what I like,' he said. 'Though I have a lot of veggies, fruit, dairy and unprocessed meats - I still have pizza on a Saturday night if I want it.' He also enjoys chowing down on steak with a creamy sauce and burgers and a side of fries. The new improved Nathan feels like a completely different person from his heftier days. 'My shift in mind set has been so dramatic that is it hard to relate to that now,' he said. 'It's hard to imagine trying to walk around with that kind of weight.'","Nathan Meola was 206kg when he auditioned for The Biggest Loser show .

"They can send human beings light years away to the final frontier, but even NASA hasn’t figured out how to separate an Italian from their morning espresso. Astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti is to become not only the first Italian female in space but the first person to sample a proper short black coffee at zero gravity. The spacewoman, who docked safely at the International Space Station today, was travelling with a Russian cosmonaut Anton Shkaplerov who in line with Russian tradition brought along 15 boxes of caviar. Scroll down for video . Caffeine fix: Italian astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti couldn't be separated from her espresso even in space . Six hours after blast off from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, the Russian Soyuz spacecraft arrived at the orbiting space lab on the Soyuz TMA-15M spacecraft at 0249 GMT Monday, NASA said. It said: ‘A new vehicle has arrived. The Soyuz is confirmed as attached properly, high above the Pacific Ocean.’ Cristoforetti, Shkaplerov and American astronaut Terry Virts are to stay at the space station until May 2015. ‘There will be 15 boxes of 30 grams each of caviar, but also apples, oranges, tomatoes and 140 doses of freeze dried milk and black tea without sugar,’ a space station official told Russian news agency TASS. Cristoforetti will be able to get her morning caffeine fix after celebrated Italian coffee makers Lavazza teamed up with space food specialist engineering firm Argotec to create a special and lightweight machine. Waving goodbye: Samantha Cristoforetti from Italy (right) and US astronaut Terry Virts (left) during a sending-off ceremony before the launch . Getting ready: Miss Cristoforetti tests a space suit during the pre-launch preparations at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan . However she may have to drink it through a straw as liquids including drinks and soups are normally consumed in this way to stop them contaminating equipment. Cristoforetti, 37, a captain in the Italian air force, 'will be not only the first female astronaut from Italy to go into space, but also the very first astronaut in the history of the conquest of space to savour an authentic Italian espresso in orbit,' the two companies said. The International Space Station is a joint project funded mostly by NASA but astronauts are transported there only by Russia after the US ended its space shuttle program in 2011. Most of the food on board is preserved and vacuum-sealed. The sense of taste is reduced in space so extra spices are added. Astronauts eagerly await any new spaceships as they bring fresh fruit and vegetables with them which cannot be grown in space.","Samantha Cristoforetti took a specially adapted machine into space .

"A heavily tattooed woman has lashed out at an Adelaide restaurant after being told she wouldn't be welcomed back if she didn't cover up next time. Alisa Marie Giuliani, 25, was on a date at the Base bar, at the Bath Hotel in Norwood, east of Adelaide's CBD when she says she was approached by a security guard who had a word with her about her tattoos. She has taken her disgust, following the incident to social media and says she was left feeling 'insulted' and 'upset'. Alisa Marie Giuliani (pictured) is disgusted by how she was treated by a Norwood restaurant . The Bath Hotel (pictured) say they didn't mean to cause any grief to the young woman but have policy and procedures to abide by . 'You know what's awesome?? Paying $50 for a pizza and some cider, sitting down to enjoy your meal and the company of a lovely guy, when the security guard from the bar attached next door decides to approach you mid meal,' she posted on her Facebook page. 'He said half way through my meal and we'd been there quite while that the owners don't want people with full tattoos there,' said Ms Giuliani. 'I thought it was incredibly rude since I had been in there 15 minutes, given them my money, it was awful, poor business.' She said her date also had tattoos and believes the comments were directed at both of them. 'I was shocked that this kind of thing happens at a bar or pup still.' 'Hundreds of people have tattoos in Adelaide, they'd be appalled to hear that happened.' '10 years ago it was very different, I feel like discrimination like that is one step away from people with being rejected for their colour,' she said. The picture of her finished meal after she was asked to cover up next time she came to the venue, which she used to post an angry message on Facebook . Alisa Giuliani (pictured) said 'nobody deserves to be insulted when they're eating a meal they've paid for' Ms Giuliani hit out at the Norwood hotel on social media calling them 'discriminatory jerks' and claiming they waited until after they had finished their meal to tell her. 'Do yourself a favour and boycott this s**t place,' she wrote on Facebook. 'Nobody deserves to be insulted when they're eating a meal they've paid for. And we dressed so nicely! I've never been so offended during a meal in my life. Absolute foul.' The post received a wave of support suggesting the stance by hotel staff was very rude and many claimed it was disgusting to see a person treated in that way. responding to some of the comments, Ms Giuliani says she had never been kicked out of a place or asked to cover her tattoos, ever, admitting she had been almost everywhere in Adelaide. Alisa Giuliani (pictured) says she has never been bothered about her tattoos before . The Bath Hotel in Norwood says they hope they didn't cause Alisa Giuliani (pictured) grief but they just have to abide by policy and procedure although admit they may be behind the times . 'Pathetic, I have never had problems with other guy mates who had ink in the past,' she continued on her Facebook page. She has been humbled by the response at an incident she has labelled so ridiculous. 'So many were people horrified by it, it was shared all over Australia, shows people are shocked how sad it is,' she said . Hotel owner Tony Franzon says it unfortunate this has blown up saying the hotel simply had policy and procedure to follow. 'I think we handled it politely and not to cause the young lady any grief, we're hospitality and we need to appeal to a multiple amount of people's enjoyment,' he said. 'It's a difficult policy because everything is changing and we need to maybe look at adjusting it, to do business.' 'It's (having tattoos) become more socially acceptable than five years ago and that's a dilemma we face and the question is where do you draw the line.' Mr Fanzon says the Bath Hotel has been a family run business for 29 years and they're certainly not here to cause anyone grief. 'The dress code is there to keep some sort of restrictions in place, unfortunately we don't allow for changing trends in fashion and maybe that's something we should review,' he said. Ms Giuliani hopes there will be changes and all pubs, clubs and restaurants will be less judgemental. 'Skin you can't change, it would be fantastic if the world would be more open.' But whether she'll consider going back there for a meal, covered up, 'definitely not'. Alisa Giuliani was on a date at the Bath Hotel (pictured) when she was told by a security guard next time she came to the hotel she would have to cover up her tattoos . Ms Giuliani's Facebook friend, Ashlee Adams (pictured) had a similar experience with the same hotel years earlier and was told to leave because 'we don't allow tattooed people in here' Ashlee Adams (pictured) also was told to leave by security at the Bath Hotel a couple of years ago because she had tattoos that were showing . The matter was made aware to South Australia's Equal Opportunity Commission who stuck up for the restaurant because it was entitled to force dress codes. 'Dress codes, which could include restrictions on visible tattoos, are not grounds for complaint under South Australia's equal opportunity laws,' said Commissioner for Equal Opportunity Anne Gale. 'In effect, licensed venues have a right to set their own dress code,' she said. Another one of Ms Giuliani's Facebook friends says she also had a similar experience at the same hotel years earlier on a quiet Thursday evening. 'I was actually approached by security and rudely asked to leave midway through my meal that I had already paid for because 'we don't allow tattooed people in here',' said model Ashlee Adams. She said after a discussion with security she was allowed to finish her dinner before being made to leave. 'It was very embarrassing and seemed a bit ridiculous considering I had been in the venue over half an hour already, had interacted with multiple staff members, spent money, and was well dressed, polite and well behaved.' 'I get having a dress code, and if they want to exclude tattooed people that's fine because it's their business and they can do what they want, but they should probably make it a little more clear and enforce that rule upon entry rather than allowing people to hand over money and order food and then asking them to leave,' she said.","Adelaide woman hits out at restaurant after being told she wouldn't be welcome back if she didn't cover her tattoos .

"Nato have blamed bad maps for last month's drone strike that killed 24 Pakistani troops at a post close to the Afghan border. An investigation into the attack concluded that reliance on incorrect mapping information shared with the Pakistani liaison officer resulted in a misunderstanding about the true location of Pakistani military units.' The US Defence Department said the investigation found US forces - given . what information they had available to them at the time - reacted in . self-defence and with appropriate force after being fired upon from the . direction of the Pakistani border. This photo released by the Pakistani military shows the Pakistani border . post struck by a cross-border Nato air strike in the Mohmand tribal . district. Nato officials blamed 'bad mapping' for the attack . 'Friendly fire': The border post was still smouldering days later . A Nato spokesman said: 'The report says we recognise we made mistakes, and that mistakes were also made by the Pakistanis. 'We have a lot of work to do to improve co-ordination, and we've already implemented steps to do that.' 'Inadequate co-ordination by US and .

Casualties: Pakistani Army soldiers carry coffins containing bodies of their comrades killed in the airstrike on November 27 . Retaliation: Pakistani authorities have closed-off Nato's supply routes in to Afghanistan for the last 26 days . Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani has suggested the country's military is plotting a coup d'état. Tension between the civilian government and the army intensified this week after news leaked of a secret memo sent to Washington asking for help in averting a supposed military coup. The Supreme Court has begun a hearing into the scandal, which has already forced Pakistan's ambassador to the US to resign and also threatens the president. The crisis comes as Pakistan faces a violent Taliban insurgency, a failing economy and severe tension with its most important ally, the United States, over the drone attack. Gilana said: 'Conspiracies are being hatched to pack up the elected government. While he did not specifically blame the military he later made it clear in a speech to parliament that the army must operate under the control of the government. He said: 'They have to be answerable to this parliament. They cannot be a state within a state.' 'This, coupled with other gaps in . information about the activities and placement of units from both sides, . contributed to the tragic result,' it said. Nato, . Afghanistan and Pakistan forces use the joint border control centres to . share information and co-ordinate security operations. Since . the attack on the Pakistani military outposts in mountainous east Kunar . province, a furious Pakistani government has shut down Nato supply . routes to Afghanistan and thrown the US out of its Shamsi Air base in . south-western Baluchistan province. The base was used to maintain drones used in strikes against insurgents hiding in safe havens in Pakistan's lawless tribal belt on the Afghan frontier. Washington views Pakisatn's co-operation as crucial to helping to stabilize the region before foreign combat troops leave Afghanistan in 2014. U.S.- Pakistani relations were already frayed after the secret U.S. raid in May that killed Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. 'For the loss of life - and for the lack of proper co-ordination between US and Pakistani forces that contributed to those losses - we express our deepest regret. 'We further express sincere . condolences to the Pakistani people, to the Pakistani government, and . most importantly to the families of the Pakistani soldiers who were . killed or wounded,' the statement said. 'It . added that the military's focus would now be to learn from the mistakes . and 'take whatever corrective measures are required to ensure an . incident like this is not repeated.' Hostile: The attacks have strained the relationship between Pakistan and the U.S. 'More critically, we must work to improve the level of trust between our two countries. 'We cannot operate effectively on the border - or in other parts of our relationship - without addressing the fundamental trust still lacking between us. 'We earnestly hope the Pakistani military will join us in bridging that gap,' the statement said.","Vital ally has closed off Nato supply routes into Afghanistan for the past 26 days in retaliation .

"Two women and a dog were miraculously rescued Sunday after their 3-story apartment building suddenly collapsed on Chicago's South Side. Chicago Fire Department spokesman Larry Langford says the collapse of the just 3-year-old building after 7pm in the Washington Park neighborhood 'pancaked all floors toward the basement.' Miraculously, the women--one in her 70s who lived on the top floor and another in her 50s--were both alert when they were pulled from the rubble. A pit bull named Tigger was rescued, as well. Rubble: Morning brought this upsetting view of a pile of rubble that was once one of the Chicago area's newest buildings . Miraculous: Two women and a dog were miraculously pulled alive from this pile of rubble that was once a 3-story apartment building on Chicago's South Side . Unbelievable: The women--one in her 70s who lived on the top floor and one in her 50s--were both in serious to critical condition when they were rescued and both were awake and able to speak . Neighbors told the Chicago Tribune they first heard one or possibly two very loud booms followed by a flash of blue light. Then the entire building was reduced to rubble. 'Boom. It was the loudest explosion I ever heard,' neighbor McKiley Jonkins told the Chicago Sun-Times. Once the building went down, several residents ran outside to a shocking scene. The air remained thick with dust several minutes. When that finally settled, debris could be seen covering cars parked on nearby streets and piled up where there once stood a nearly brand new three-story building. 'That thing that looks like it is the roof' said neighbor Angela Brooks told WFLD, 'is kind of sitting on the front of my car.' Collateral damage: Cars parked on the street near the 3-year-old home were covered in debris as well, some were even totaled . Search and rescue: Rescuers worked into the night Sunday to sift through the debris and ensure no one else was there to be rescued, though neighbors said there was no one else in the buidling . 'Who would really make it out of something like this?' Jonkins remembered thinking. Langford said the older woman was awake and talking when she was taken to the hospital in serious to critical condition. The younger woman was rescued earlier and was also in serious to critical condition. She was also alert at the time. As they begin to heal, investigators will start piecing together what caused their brush with tragedy. Langford said the cause was unknown, but authorities were working with the utility companies to make sure there wasn't a problem with the gas line.","The Washington Park neighborhood was rocked by the mysterious blast after 7pm Sunday that leveled the 3-year-old three-story building .

"Nick Gibb said the fact that pupils who spoke English as a second language tended to be academically more able . A Conservative education minister has insisted that immigration is changing the culture of schools for the better – and pushing up academic standards. Nick Gibb said the fact that pupils who spoke English as a second language tended to be academically more able, because they had learned to speak two languages. And he said that when headteachers complain to that the influx of migrants was harming school standards, he tells them they should be doing better. The comments from Mr Gibb contrast with those of Iain Duncan Smith, the Work and Pensions Secretary, who last week said immigration was changing the ‘character’ of schools. He said that new arrivals in many communities ‘literally change the schooling because so many people arrive not speaking English’. And last month Sir Michael Wilshaw, the chief inspector of schools, said schools are struggling to cope with an ‘influx’ of migrant pupils – and said that a lack of resources to deal with them was now a ‘big issue’ for government. Even David Cameron has said that immigration from Europe was putting ‘pressure’ on public services such as schools and hospitals. Critics warn there is a serious shortage of places at primaries - at which one in five pupils now speak English as a second language. In some parts of London, children with English as a second language now make up as much as three-quarters of the school roll. The figure is around half in places including Slough, Luton and Leicester. But speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live’s Pienaar’s Politics, Mr Gibb said he did not accept that immigration was causing ‘problems’ in schools. ‘Children who speak English as a second language tend to push up the academic standards in schools because they've learnt one language already,’ he said. ‘Those schools that tell me that they are struggling with their results because of higher proportions of children with a second language as English, I say to them their results should be higher still because those children have proven themselves able to learn another language and they are very academically able. Gibb said that when headteachers complain to that the influx of migrants was harming school standards, he tells them they should be doing better. Picture posed by models . he comments from Mr Gibb contrast with those of Iain Duncan Smith, the Work and Pensions Secretary, who last week said immigration was changing the ‘character’ of schools . ‘So I don't really accept that we have problems in our schools so far as population is concerned. We are expanding the number of school places in our schools, we've given billions of pounds, £5billion more money to local authorities to build more school places in our country.’ Mr Gibb admitted that people are ‘concerned’ about immigration. But he added: ‘Don't underestimate what has been achieved over the last four and half years. We have brought down net immigration by a quarter since 2010. ‘Non-EU immigration we have taken steps such as closing down 650 bogus colleges, we've brought in a new income test for bringing in a spouse from outside the country and outside the EU. ‘All those measures have had a huge effect in bringing down non-EU immigration. We do need to tackle EU migration. The Prime Minister is going to be saying something about that later this month.’ Last month, Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw said: ‘When they’re faced with an influx of children from other countries, [schools] need the resources and capacity to deal with it and if those resources aren’t there, that’s a big issue for government.’ Following the comments, Education Secretary Nicky Morgan tried to downplay the impact of migration on schools, insisting schools were ‘doing extremely well’ with students from abroad. Mrs Morgan said his language wasn’t ‘helpful’, adding: ‘When I go round schools I see that they have adapted and are doing extremely well with students who do come from abroad.’","Nick Gibb said pupils with English as second language are better at school .

"A gang who attempted to flood Britain with £60 million worth of drugs hidden in foil takeaway cartons have been jailed for a total of 88 years. The five men used a Worcestershire farm as a front for smuggling cannabis, amphetamines and MDMA from the Netherlands into the UK before selling them on to gangs from across the country. When police raided the farm in Kempsey they discovered the gang had concealed the drugs in takeaway containers before sending them to haulage yards in the West Midlands and Worcestershire. Jacobus Martinus Samson (left) was jailed for 20 years, Robert Whitehouse (centre) for 22 years and six months and Richard Dale (right) for 12 years, all for smuggling £60 million worth of drugs into the UK . Once there the drugs were separated and collected by organised crime groups from across the UK. The huge criminal enterprise was uncovered in July last year as part of Operation Gaul, a joint investigation by Warwickshire Police and West Mercia Police. Among other items officers discovered around 50 takeaway trays filled with amphetamines at a haulage yard in Walsall. Officers seized £13.5 million worth of drugs, including more than 1,000kg of cannabis, 107kg of MDMA and 64kg of amphetamines. Police discovered 50 takeaway trays filled with amphetamines at a haulage yard in Walsall during a raid . A court heard the haulage yard had been duped into handling the pallets and had no knowledge of what was inside them. On Friday the gang were jailed at Birmingham Crown Court for a combined total of 88 years and 10 months after pleading guilty to conspiracy to import drugs. Robert Scott, 67, of Worcester, was jailed for 20 years and Robert Whitehouse, 68, of Bromsgrove, was jailed 22 years and six months. Peter Hillback, 42, of Cheslyn Hay, Staffordshire, was jailed for 14 years and four months and Jacobus Martinus Samson, 64, of Beek Ubbergen, in the Netherlands, was jailed for 20 years. Robert Scott (left) was jailed for 20 years and Peter Hillback (right) was jailed for 14 years and four months . Richard Dale, 51, of Walsall, West Midlands, was jailed for 12 years after he was found guilty of conspiracy to import drugs following a trial in September. Detective Inspector Carl Moore from Warwickshire Police, said: 'The sentences handed out should serve as a significant deterrent to anyone involved in criminality of this kind.' Kiernan Cunningham, senior prosecutor from West Midlands Crown Prosecution Service's complex casework unit, said: 'These individuals have today been sentenced for their part in an organised criminal empire which was built on human pain and suffering. 'By all of their illegal actions these defendants were intending to add to that pain and suffering.' The five men used a farm as a front for smuggling cannabis, amphetamines and MDMA from the Netherlands . Nigel Powell, 52, and Stephen Jones, 54, both of Ross-on-Wye in Herefordshire, will be sentenced next month after they were found guilty of conspiracy to supply drugs. West Mercia Police confirmed the gang had successfully smuggled £46.5 million worth of drugs into the UK between October 2012 and February 2014 before they were caught. A force spokeswoman said: 'We conducted multiple seizures between October 2012 and February 2014. 'In our investigation, we estimate that during this time they would have smuggled in about £60 million worth of drugs in total.'","Five men used as a farm as a front for smuggling drugs from Netherlands .
