"(CNN) -- The Atlantic Ocean, hurricane-wise, has been relatively quiet this season. But not the northeastern Pacific. On Saturday, the 12th storm so far this summer and fall grew to hurricane status -- not threatening anything on land yet, though it would certainly be understandable if folks on the Mexican coast with fresh memories of Hurricane Odile are a little spooked. As of 2 p.m. (5 p.m. ET), Hurricane Rachel was centered well offshore about 460 miles west-southwest of the southern tip of Baja California, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center. It boasted 75 mph sustained winds, an uptick from earlier, as it churned north-northwest at an 8 mph clip. It is expected to continue in this direction, and get a little slower, through Sunday, though ""little motion"" is expected come Monday. There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect. And there may not be any to come, given it's far from land and has fairly limited movement. The hurricane center's discussion notes that Rachel ""does not have much time to strengthen further, given that it will be moving over gradually cooler waters and into a drier and more stable environment during the next day or so."" The forecast called for the storm to weaken by Sunday afternoon. Still, even a hint of potential tropical trouble might cause headaches in the region. While the northwest Atlantic and Caribbean have only have had four hurricanes -- Arthur, Bertha, Cristobal and Edouard -- this summer and fall, the northeast Pacific has been a different story. The region's most recent big hit came compliments of Hurricane Odile. Less than two weeks ago, Odile snapped palm trees, washed out roads, trashed outdoor markets and damaged facilities, including the Los Cabos airport. Many tourists found themselves stranded in popular Baja California resorts, unable to get anywhere because of the storm.","Rachel strengthens into a hurricane, centered 460 miles off Mexico's coast .

"(CNN) -- A Southwest Airlines plane made an emergency return to Tennessee's Nashville International Airport on Monday morning because it hit several birds during takeoff, the airline said. The captain of Flight 3387, which had been bound for Baltimore-Washington International Airport, declared an emergency after birds entered one of the Boeing 737's two engines, Southwest spokeswoman Michelle Agnew said. The plane, which had taken off from the Nashville airport at 6:35 a.m., made a safe landing there shortly afterward, Agnew said. Firetrucks met the plane as a precaution, but the landing was uneventful, Southwest said. The plane was put out of service for maintenance, and the airline said it was working on other ways to get the plane's 110 passengers to their destination. Agnew said she didn't know exactly how the bird strike affected the engine. ""Bird strike"" is the term used for incidents in which planes collide with birds. Often the creatures get sucked into a plane's engine. A record 10,726 wildlife strikes by airplanes -- 97% of which involved birds -- were reported in the United States in 2012, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. One of the most famous bird-plane encounters in recent years resulted in the ""Miracle on the Hudson."" On January 15, 2009, US Airways Flight 1549 left New York's LaGuardia Airport and ran into a flock of geese that damaged both engines, forcing the crew to make an emergency landing in the Hudson River. Rescuers reached the aircraft and found passengers standing on its wings. Everyone was rescued.","NEW: Birds went into one of the plane's two engines, Southwest spokeswoman says .

"(CNN) -- James DiMaggio's family is requesting DNA samples from the family of Hannah Anderson, the 16-year-old girl he's accused of kidnapping and whose mother and brother were found dead in his burned home. The reason? They want to know if he was Hannah and 8-year-old Ethan's biological father, a family spokesman said. ""We are going to be requesting from the Anderson family that we try to get DNA samples from Hannah. And if they have anything left from Ethan, that we get a DNA sample,"" family spokesman Andrew Spanswick told CNN affiliate KGTV. ""There has been a lot of rumors that Jim might be the father of either or both children."" Reached by CNN, Spanswick said DiMaggio's sister, Lora, is making the request, but would not elaborate further. A representative for the Anderson family appeared to shoot down the theory. ""Brett and Tina Anderson did not meet Mr. DiMaggio until the sixth month of Tina's pregnancy with Hannah. Brett Anderson's DNA was used to identify the body of his dead son Ethan Anderson,"" the family statement said. And David Braun, Tina Anderson's uncle, reacted angrily to the idea. ""I would tell them to shut up with their accusations and their implications up until after the funeral, until after my precious Tina and precious Ethan are buried -- the family members that your family murdered,"" Braun said. ""That's what I would tell them."" Mother, brother laid to rest . A complex case . There was a time when the Hannah Anderson abduction case seemed clear-cut. DiMaggio, a close Anderson family friend, allegedly kills Hannah's mother and brother, burns his house down, kidnaps Hannah and goes on the run. After a frantic week-long manhunt, he is spotted in the Idaho wilderness and shot dead by an FBI agent. Hannah is safe and reunited with her father. That was on August 10. With each passing day since then, the case has taken on added complexity. On Monday, the Anderson family spokeswoman told CNN that DiMaggio, 40, left a life insurance policy from his job as a telecommunications tech that named Hannah and Ethan's grandmother, Bernice Anderson, as the beneficiary. Stacy Hess, the spokeswoman, did not know the dollar amount but other media outlets put it at around $110,000. ""We find it very strange that he has left all this money without any explanation,"" Spanswick told KGTV, in explaining the need for the DNA tests. ""It states specifically that he didn't want to give it to either parent cause he didn't trust them,"" Spanswick said, referring to Hannah's parents. The Anderson children called DiMaggio ""Uncle Jim."" One search warrant referred to Hannah's mother as DiMaggio's ""best friend's wife."" Anderson's letters found at kidnap suspect's home . Hannah spotted with captor . Then there is this. Hannah was seen in a car with DiMaggio about 20 hours before he allegedly set fire to his house, police said Tuesday. The two were seen in DiMaggio's blue Nissan Versa just after midnight Sunday, August 4, said San Diego County Sheriff's Department spokeswoman Jan Caldwell. She confirmed reporting from the Los Angeles Times that the two were spotted at a U.S. Border Patrol checkpoint. Caldwell did not say what the two were doing together, or if Hannah Anderson was with DiMaggio voluntarily. CNN was unable to get an Anderson family response to this revelation. Actions raise eyebrows . Some of Hannah's actions have raised eyebrows in some quarters. A friend of Hannah's told authorities ""DiMaggio took her on multiple day trips,"" according to a search warrant. The same document said phone records indicate the two ""called each other approximately 13 times"" shortly before both their phones were turned off around 4 p.m. (7 p.m. ET) on August 4. That was around the time that Hannah was picked up from cheerleading practice at Sweetwater High School, the warrant says, while noting it wasn't known who picked her up. The same document says that a fire was reported at around 8 p.m. later that day at DiMaggio's two-story log cabin and a detached garage in Boulevard, California. After battling the fire, authorities found the bodies of the teenager's mother, Christina Anderson, and Ethan. An affidavit claimed that both had been ""tortured and killed"" by DiMaggio, who then set his home and garage ablaze. Affidavits: Mother, brother 'tortured and killed' A fire captain found Christina Anderson face down in the garage, covered with a tarp, and with a crowbar and what appeared to be blood next to her head. The manhunt . An Amber Alert was issued the next day. The ordeal ended about 1,000 miles from where it started, on August 10, when an FBI tactical agent shot and killed DiMaggio in the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness, about 15 miles outside Cascade, Idaho. As to Hannah, she was physically unharmed and soon returned to her family in Southern California. The teenager hasn't spoken publicly or with reporters since the ordeal. But she did field anonymous questions on the website ask.fm, according to Alan MacNabb, whose son is one of Hannah's closest friends. In those comments, she said DiMaggio had apparently set some kind of a timing device to start the blaze at his home. She also said she did not want to go with her ""dad's best friend"" and that, had she tried to escape from him, ""He would have killed me."" Search finds . Friend: Hannah speaks about kidnapping on social media . San Diego County deputies searching DiMaggio's charred home found a handwritten note, handcuff box, camping equipment, a DNA swab kit, two used condoms and letters from Hannah, according to an affidavit. Contents of the letters and the handwritten note were not revealed in the affidavit. CNN's Traci Tamura contributed to this report.","NEW: Hannah's great-uncle to DiMaggio family: 'Shut up'

"Washington (CNN) -- Republican K. Carl Smith is African-American and he knows that the GOP's racial reckoning won't come from 100-page reports from party headquarters with carefully worded prescriptions about ""outreach"" to ""demographic partners."" Instead, the type of sea change needed to shake the GOP's image as a party of old, white and culturally-insulated men will require the type of profound grassroots shakeup that might make some in the GOP uneasy. ""You got your establishment Republicans who want to keep things the same,"" said Smith, an Army veteran who grew up in Alabama during the Civil Rights era. ""The status quo needs to go through some, I won't say diversity classes, but I'll say liberty classes and learn about helping people on the bottom of the ladder."" He said the party also has to deal with small but noisy elements that co-opt any message of inclusiveness if it wants to win the ""propaganda battle."" Full CPAC coverage . When Smith, founder of the Frederick Douglass Republicans, tried to share his message while leading a panel at last weekend's Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland, he found himself face to face with that fringe. Smith said one young attendee said Douglass, an abolitionist, should have thanked his slave masters for giving him food and shelter and that segregation wasn't such a bad policy. The Republican National Committee knows it has major work ahead as it tries to make inroads with racial minorities, young voters and women. The group released a 100-page report analyzing its losses in the 2012 presidential election as well as seats in the House. GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney lost big among Latinos, African-Americans and Asians. ""The report notes the way we communicate our principles isn't resonating widely enough,"" RNC Chairman Reince Priebus said. ""Focus groups described our party as 'narrow-minded,' 'out of touch,' and 'stuffy old men.'"" ""It all goes back to what our moms used to tell us: It's not just what we say; it's how we say it,"" Priebus continued. Republicans want to change perception of 'stuffy old men' Romney's hardline stance on immigration, including his endorsement of a policy of ""self-deportation,"" may be one reason why he won just 27% of Latino voters -- a lower percentage than the last two GOP presidential candidates. But Romney isn't the only Republican politician who has used that type of rhetoric. Similar comments from other GOP politicians coupled with the occasional pronouncements of President Barack Obama as ""lazy"" helps to cement for minorities an impression of the Republican Party as out of touch and out of sync with minority communities, said Andra Gillespie, an associate professor of political science at Emory University in Atlanta. Outreach and naming minorities to committee positions is great, Gillespie said, but the party has much harder work ahead. Party leaders will have to work to better understand the minority groups they are reaching out to. In the case of African-Americans and Latinos, that will mean recognizing the fact that a strong sense of ""linked fate"" means many members of this group may be loathe to take a hardline position on cutting entitlement programs, immigration or changing the Voting Rights Act because someone they know may be adversely affected, Gillespie said. ""If prominent Republicans are signing amicus briefs supporting dismantling affirmative action, African-Americans and Latinos will have a problem with that,"" Gillespie said. She added that the GOP also won't win broader minority support ""in the budget talks advocating dismantling programs that disproportionately help people of color while keeping programs that are perceived in helping the well off."" ""It's going to take some platform changes,"" Gillespie said. ""The identity politics they decry is something minorities hold dear. That's a compromise some people will be unwilling to make."" The RNC report underscored this point. Opinion: GOP has power where it counts - the states . ""If Hispanic Americans perceive that a GOP nominee or candidate does not want them in the United States, they will not pay attention to our next sentence,"" it states. In one of its few policy recommendations, the report counsels Republicans to ""embrace and champion"" comprehensive immigration reform. Lionel Sosa, a veteran Latino GOP strategist who has helped advise candidates since 1980, put it more bluntly. ""Token efforts, such as tamale parties, will no longer work,"" Sosa told CNN last year. ""Winning will require more than outreach. It will require inclusion."" ""Latinos, African-Americans and people of other races must be represented in the important decision-making strategies of any given campaign, whether it be for a Democrat or Republican."" For his part, Smith holds out hope that the GOP's attempts to bring more minorities into the Big Tent will align the party's views with those of Douglass, his personal hero who he says shared Republican values. But he's looking for more than platitudes about inclusiveness. The party, Smith said, has got to tie principles about self-reliance and getting weaned off government dependence to efforts to help people become entrepreneurs and gain a stronger economic foothold. ""The Republican Party has to be sincere, otherwise the outcome is not going to work and it's going to fail,"" Smith said. 5 things post-CPAC: New faces, old music and winners/losers .","Republican outreach to minority cited as a priority in new report .

"(CNN) -- When it comes to thinking about affirmative action, there's an old way and a new way. The old way was in full bloom this week at the Supreme Court, in a blistering 58-page dissenting opinion by Justice Sonia Sotomayor in what was a state's rights case involving a 2006 Michigan law banning the use of racial criteria in publicly funded college and university admissions, and the question of whether these matters can be settled not just by courts but also by voters. The new way is on display in California, where lawmakers who want to amend the state constitution to reinstate racial and ethnic preferences at public colleges and universities -- something that was banned by a 1996 ballot initiative -- have a formidable opponent in the form of a group that knows a little something about discrimination: Asian-Americans. Under the old way of thinking, the narrative goes like this: There was once in this country ugly, overt and systematic discrimination based on race or ethnicity. African-Americans in the South and Mexican-Americans in the Southwest were excluded not just from barbershops, country clubs and public swimming pools, but also from places that could change the destinies of individuals and uplift families -- colleges and universities. There had to be a corrective device, the thinking went, by which these institutions that had previously treated race and ethnicity of certain groups as a negative could flip the script and treat it as a positive. Some people saw it as a reparation, a historical payoff. But it was more of an acknowledgment that discrimination leaves behind vestiges, and institutions that once went out of their way to be unwelcoming to certain groups now had to go out of their way to be welcoming to those groups by taking applicants' race and ethnicity into account. This is how Sotomayor, a graduate of Princeton University and Yale Law School, sees the program that she has often credited for opening those doors. In her dissent in the Michigan case, part of which she read aloud to her colleagues, the nation's first Latina Supreme Court justice wrote: ""This refusal to accept the stark reality that race matters is regrettable. The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to speak openly and candidly on the subject of race, and to apply the Constitution with eyes open to the unfortunate effects of centuries of racial discrimination. As members of the judiciary tasked with intervening to carry out the guarantee of equal protection, we ought not sit back and wish away, rather than confront, the racial inequality that exists in our society."" Anyone out there support racial inequality and think it ought to be preserved? I didn't think so. Besides, this case wasn't about whether racial and ethnic preferences are good or bad, but whether their use could be restricted by voters at the state level. By a vote of 6-to-2, the high court ruled that it could be. Meanwhile, in California, there is a group that -- like Sotomayor -- really dislikes racial inequality. So much so that they don't think it ought to be reinstated by the state legislature under the pretext of expanding educational opportunity. In Alabama or Georgia or Mississippi, the dominant racial storyline is black-and-white. But in California, the most interesting relationship -- the one that will help define the future of the nation's most populous state -- is the relationship between Latinos and Asian-Americans. At 38% of the population, Latinos now make up a plurality in California. Yet the fastest-growing minority in the state is Asian-Americans, who now make up nearly 14% of California, or more than twice the number of African-Americans. And just as Latinos are divided on issues such as immigration and bilingual education, so, too, are there differences of opinion among Asian-Americans when the conversation turns to affirmative action. Still, what sends shock waves through the debate in California is that one of the most prominent subsets -- Chinese-Americans -- is opposed to the idea of colleges and universities taking into account race and ethnicity. Organizations representing that constituency pressured a small group of Asian-American lawmakers to stall the legislation. They did. You might think that an ethnic group that holds nearly 40% of seats in the University of California system would have little to complain about. You'd be wrong. Asian-American organizations that oppose racial and ethnic preferences claim that the 40% figure could soar to 50% or 60% if colleges and universities awarded slots based on merit. They insist that there is a quota to keep the Asian-American students below 50%, and that this primarily benefits white students who might not be able to compete head-to-head with Asian-Americans. Welcome to affirmative action, California-style, where things get complicated. As the debate plays out in this state, you don't hear much about ""reparations"" or the ""vestiges of discrimination."" The dominant themes are ""merit"" and ""fairness."" Those are not small things. Let's put to rest the old way of thinking about affirmative action and confront the new challenges that lie ahead in a country that, with every passing day, resembles less and less what it used to be.","Ruben Navarrette: There's an old and new way of thinking about affirmative action .

"Washington (CNN) -- In the context of 2016, Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren are rivals for the Democrats' presidential nomination whose every word about each other is scrutinized and picked apart. But Warren and Clinton have been on the national stage for years, and before they were ever considered rivals, they met each other in the late '90s. Warren spoke about the meeting in a 2004 interview on Bill Moyers' ""NOW on PBS"" show. Warren reflects glowingly of Clinton as first lady but also bluntly talks about how Clinton's election to the Senate in 2000 changed the former secretary of state. In 1998, Warren -- an expert and professor on bankruptcy law -- wrote an op-ed for The New York Times titled ""Bankrupt? Pay Your Child Support First,"" about how the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2000 would disproportionally hurt women and families trying to collect alimony checks from their ex-husbands. The piece, Warren tells Moyers, was eventually read by then-first lady Clinton, whose office subsequently set up a meeting with the professor in Boston. ""After she's finished her speech, we're ushered into a tiny, little room somewhere in the bowels of this hotel, and just the two of us. They close the door. Mrs. Clinton sits down. We have hamburgers and french fries,"" Warren says. Warren adds: ""And she (Clinton) says, 'Tell me about bankruptcy.' And I got to tell you, I never had a smarter student. Quick, right to the heart of it. I go over the law. It's a complex law. Went over the economics. Showed her the graphs, showed her the charts. And she got it."" According to Warren, at the end of the briefing, Clinton stood up and said: ""Professor Warren, we've got to stop that awful bill."" Warren opinion: What happened to the middle class? The first lady went back to Washington and became a strong proponent of killing the bill. In ""Living History,"" her memoir about her time as first lady, Clinton writes: ""proposed bankruptcy reform moving through Congress threatened to undermine the spousal and child support many women depended on."" She writes, ""Missing from this debate, I discovered, was any discussion of what happens to women and children who depend on legally required child and spousal support that is not being paid."" President Bill Clinton would go on to veto the measure, a win that Warren says Hillary Clinton ""rightly should"" take credit for. But then Warren's interview with Moyers takes a turn as the professor reflects on how Clinton changed when she won a U.S. Senate seat in 2000 and voted in favor of a similar bankruptcy bill in 2001. ""As Senator Clinton, the pressures are very different,"" Warren says. ""It's a well-financed industry. ... She has taken money from the groups, and more to the point, she worries about them as a constituency."" Elizabeth Warren in 2016? Republicans take notice . Clinton is not the only one who was changed by the U.S. Senate, however. Warren, who since 2004 has gone on to become a senator from Massachusetts, was far more candid about Clinton in her 2004 interview than she was in an interview with Yahoo's Katie Couric this week. ""You know, I worry a lot about the relationship between all of them: regulators, government and Wall Street,"" Warren said when asked if Clinton was ""too cozy"" with Wall Street. Couric then pressed Warren: ""But what about Hillary Clinton in particular?"" ""Well,"" she responds. ""I worry across the board."" Warren co-authored opinion: We need to rein in 'too big to fail' banks .","Elizabeth Warren told Bill Moyers in 2004 that she briefed Hillary Clinton about bankruptcy .

"(CNN) -- In September of 2006, President Bush announced that 14 suspected terrorists who were being held in CIA custody had been transferred to the U.S. prison camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Alleged 9/11 planner Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was held in secret and moved to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The men were to be tried before military tribunals. U.S. officials have said the suspects are linked to terrorist plots -- both successful and thwarted. Those terror plots include the 2002 bombings on the resort island of Bali, the September 11, 2001, attacks, the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole in Yemen and the 1998 attack on the U.S. Embassy in Tanzania. During a news conference acknowledging the transfer of these prisoners, Bush told reporters what set them apart from other U.S. captives. ""These are dangerous men with unparalleled knowledge about terrorist networks and their plans for new attacks,"" said Bush. He said ""questioning the detainees in this program has given us information that has saved innocent lives by helping us stop new attacks -- here in the United States and across the world.""  Bush said the prisoners would be questioned at the Guantanamo prison ""subject to the new U.S. Army Field Manual"" and ""they will continue to be treated with the humanity that they denied others."" ""I want to be absolutely clear with our people, and the world: The United States does not torture,"" said Bush. ""It's against our laws, and it's against our values. I have not authorized it -- and I will not authorize it."" Although President Obama has promised to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay, prisoners there still face military tribunals. One of the 14 men has been moved from Guantanamo to U.S. soil and is being tried in federal court.","In '06, suspected terrorists in CIA custody moved from secret prisons to Gitmo .

"(CNN) -- He's not a household name, but Rogerio Ceni is a footballer without equal. While superstars like Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi compete for major accolades, those two superstars are lagging behind the 41-year-old Brazilian goalkeeper in one football history record. Ceni has been turning out for his beloved Sao Paulo for 22 years and, at the grand old age of 41, a 3-0 Brazilian league win over Goais on Monday secured his 590th win -- the most any player has ever registered with a single club. In doing so the former Brazil international surpassed the mark previously set by Manchester United's Ryan Giggs, who racked up 589 victories with the 20-time English champions between 1990 and 2014. Giggs needed 963 appearances to reach his total, while Ceni managed the feat in 1173 games -- 868 of which were as captain. Ceni, who plans to retire from playing in December, has enjoyed a glittering career. A member of the Brazil squad which won the 2002 World Cup in Japan and South Korea, Ceni has also been the unlikely scorer of an incredible 123 goals thanks to his ability to take free-kicks and penalties. He has helped Sao Paulo win the Copa Libertadores, South America's most prestigious club competition, on two occasions, while also playing a key role as the team were crowned FIFA World Club Cup winners in 2005.","Rogerio Ceni records most ever victories with a single club Monday .

"(CNN) -- The men first ordered Ken Cordier to strip naked. A poll has sparked debate among Christians about torture. They then forced him face-down to the ground and pinned his arms and legs. One of them grabbed a fan belt from a truck and began flogging Cordier. When it was over, they returned another day with a new approach. They slung a rope around Cordier's neck, pulled him back like a bow and beat him with their fists. ""You could tell they enjoyed it,"" Cordier says. ""They had that look in their eyes and they grinned."" This is how Cordier described being tortured. He is a former U.S. Air Force pilot who was captured by the North Vietnamese in 1966. Though he was tortured for six years in captivity, Cordier says he survived because ""I never gave up faith in God and country"" But what happens when faith in God and country seem to collide? What happens when people like Cordier, who rely on their faith in God and their flag, are asked if they would support torture against suspected terrorists? Cordier says he would never support torture, but his views would make him a minority among a certain segment of Christians, according to a provocative survey. A survey conducted by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life found that white evangelical Christians are more likely to support torture than people who rarely or never attend religious services. The survey said that 62 percent of white evangelical Protestants say that the use of  torture against suspected terrorists can be often or sometimes justified in order to gain important information. When asked the same question, 40 percent of the ""religiously unaffiliated"" say torture can be often or sometimes justified. The survey, however, did not define torture or say whether ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" like waterboarding are torture. The survey comes at a time when the debate over torture is intensifying after the Obama administration released Bush-era memos that gave legal justification to ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" such as waterboarding. The survey's results have also sparked a debate within the Christian community that revolves around one question: How can a Christian support torture? When evangelicals say torture is permitted . They can't -- except in extreme circumstances, some evangelicals say. Rev. Ronald Kuykendall, an evangelical pastor in Gainesville, Florida, says that the question is difficult to answer because everyone has a different definition of torture. He says he would support the torture of a terrorist if ""the techniques used are lawful, necessary"" and the ultimate purpose is to save lives. Kuykendall says the New Testament (Romans 13:1-7) teaches Christians that ""everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established."" ""The NT [New Testament] is clear that God grants the right of the 'sword' to the state to be used against wrongdoers,"" Kuykendall says. ""Just as I believe I don't have a right to vengeance personally, I do believe that I can seek justice through the state and call the police on a robber, or a gunman threatening my life."" Chuck Colson, the evangelical pastor who once served as an aide to President Nixon, answered the same question in an online discussion conducted by the Washington Post ""On Faith"" Web site. Colson said that Christians are supposed to obey the law, but there may be times when there is a higher obligation, such as ignoring a ""no trespassing"" sign to rescue a drowning man. ""So it is with torture,"" Colson wrote. ""If a competent authority honestly believes that this was the only way to get information that might save the lives of thousands, I believe he would be justified."" Charles Kammer, a religious studies professor, says he was not surprised to learn that a majority of evangelical Christians support the use of torture in certain circumstances. Kammer says that despite Jesus' own commitment to nonviolence, Christianity as a whole has never embraced nonviolence. He says some evangelicals also confuse patriotism with piety. ""What's good for America has often been seen as God's will,"" says Kammer, who teaches at The College of Wooster in Wooster, Ohio. ""They think the torture of evil people is not bad, but may be morally required as a way of protecting the good people."" Kammer said he is a Christian and does not support torture in any circumstances. He considers waterboarding torture. ""If we're ever going to provide any moral leadership in the world,"" he says, ""we have to live in the world in a particular way. We can't criticize our enemies for doing what we're doing."" What Vietnam POWs who are Christians think of torture . The debate over the uses of torture among people of faith doesn't end with its practice. It also extends to its definition. The Geneva Conventions say that ""no physical or mental torture, nor any other form of coercion, may be inflicted on prisoners of war."" The U.N. Convention Against Torture defines torture as any act by which severe pain or suffering, ""whether physical or mental,"" is inflicted on a person. Cordier, the Vietnam POW, opposes torture in all circumstances -- even the ""ticking bomb"" scenario. ""Once you're in a pain situation, you'll say anything to get it to stop,"" Cordier says. ""It's not as reliable as more sophisticated methods."" But he doesn't consider waterboarding and other ""enhanced techniques"" torture. ""Loud music, sleep deprivation, waterboarding -- does it leave permanent damage and cause extreme pain? No,"" Cordier says. The Rev. Robert G. Certain, another Vietnam vet who is now an Episcopal priest, says waterboarding isn't torture because ""it doesn't cause grave, bodily harm."" See CIA interrogation methods authorized during the Bush-era » . Certain was captured by the Vietnamese in 1972 after his B-52 bomber was shot down. He wrote about his experiences in the book, ""Unchained Eagle."" Certain says his faith teaches him to oppose torture under all circumstances. His military background, however, tells him that it can be easy for interrogators to cross the line. ""To use torture is morally impermissible,"" Certain says. ""But when we place somebody in uniform into a place of moral ambiguity, there are likely to be times when their judgment is going to step across into the morally impermissible. They're living in a fog. It's not black and white."" Certain remembers how easily his Vietnamese captors justified crossing the line with him. They said American prisoners weren't covered by the Geneva Conventions. ""They said we were not prisoners of war because there was no legal declaration of war,"" Certain says.

"Washington (CNN) -- Recent announcements of American military deployments in response to belligerent statements by North Korea may have contributed to escalating tensions between the two countries, Pentagon officials told CNN on Thursday in explaining an effort to reduce U.S. rhetoric about the reclusive state. ""We accused the North Koreans of amping things up, now we are worried we did the same thing,"" one Defense Department official said. They spoke on the same day a U.S. official first told CNN that communications intercepts indicated North Korea may be planning to launch a mobile ballistic missile in the coming days or weeks. Classified images and communications intercepts show that North Korea has moved up to two mobile missiles, launchers and fuel tanks to its East coast, another American official with knowledge of the matter told CNN. South Korean Defense Minister Kim Kwan-jin told a parliamentary committee in Seoul that the activity signaled an imminent test firing or military drill, according to the semi-official South Korean news agency Yonhap. Amid Pyongyang bluster, missile launch feared . One U.S. official said it is believed any launch this time would be a test. The activity is consistent with a Musudan missile, the official said. The Musudan is based on a Soviet-era system and has a 2,500-mile (4,000-kilometer) range that can threaten South Korea, Japan and Southeast Asia, but not U.S. forces based on Guam. As a vital ally to South Korea since the Korean war in the 1950s, the United States has pledged military backing to Seoul in the event of an attack by North Korea. In addition, North Korea has been developing nuclear weapons technology, raising concerns of rapid proliferation in the region and even a possible nuclear strike by Pyongyang. The fraught situation on the Korean Peninsula stems from the North's latest long-range rocket launch in December and underground nuclear test in February. In response, the United States helped bring tougher U.N. sanctions on North Korea and took part in joint military exercises with South Korea, prompting Kim Jong Un's government to ratchet up its threats in recent weeks. That caused the United States to display its military strength in the annual drills taking place now, flying B-2 stealth bombers capable of carrying conventional or nuclear weapons, as well as Cold War-era B-52s and F-22 Raptor stealth fighters over South Korea. North Korea: Our global fear and fascination . On Thursday, a North Korean army official warned that ""the moment of explosion is approaching fast."" ""No one can say a war will break out in Korea or not and whether it will break out today or tomorrow,"" said the spokesman for the General Staff of the North's Korean People's Army (KPA). ""The responsibility for this grave situation entirely rests with the U.S. administration and military warmongers keen to encroach upon the DPRK's sovereignty and bring down its dignified social system with brigandish logic,"" the KPA spokesman added in a statement published by the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA). A spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council said Thursday that the United States continues to closely monitor the situation. ""Threats and provocative actions will not bring North Korea the security, international respect, and economic development it seeks,"" said the NSC spokeswoman, Caitlin Hayden. ""We will continue to urge the North Korean leadership to heed President Obama's call to choose the path of peace and come into compliance with its international obligations."" Earlier, a Defense Department official told CNN that from a communications point of view, ""we are trying to turn the volume down"" on U.S. rhetoric about North Korea. The official, speaking on condition of not being identified, said the change referred to public statements by the Obama administration instead of how U.S. military hardware were being deployed in the region. According to the official, some Pentagon officials were surprised at how U.S. news releases and statements on North Korea were generating world headlines and therefore provoking a Pyongyang response. ""We are absolutely trying to ratchet back the rhetoric,"" the official said. ""We become part of the cycle. We allowed that to happen."" Key dates in U.S. military moves near North Korea . At the State Department, spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said Thursday the United States needed to take the defensive steps it did in view of North Korea's threats, but she focused on a diplomatic solution available if Pyongyang changed its behavior. ""It was the ratcheting up of tensions on the DPRK side that caused us to need to shore up our own defense posture. We have done that,"" Nuland said. ""But we have also been saying all the way through that this does not need to get hotter, that we can change course here if the DPRK will begin to come back into compliance with its international obligations, will begin to cool things down, take a pause."" To Bill Richardson, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, the administration's response so far has been ""appropriate -- cool, calm, but at the same time putting our military resources ready in case there's an emergency."" He told CNN on Thursday that a North Korean military attack on U.S. interests would be ""suicidal,"" adding: ""That's not going to happen."" Diplomacy should be the ""end game"" for the administration's policy regarding North Korea, said Richardson, one of the few U.S. politicians to have visited the country. ""I think the administration's response does make sense in the sense that you don't want to continue this huge rhetoric and at the same time provoke some kind of incident,"" Richardson said. ""The danger is not a war with the United States or South Korea, I think. The danger is some kind of military altercation in the Yellow Sea, a naval skirmish of some kind."" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is expected to travel to South Korea, China and Japan this month to meet with his counterparts there. Previously, the Obama administration established a ""playbook"" of pre-scripted actions and responses to the last several weeks of North Korean rhetoric and provocations, an administration official said Thursday. The scripted actions included an increased show of U.S. military force -- such as the flying of B-2 bombers -- during the annual U.S.-South Korea military exercise, the Foal Eagle. ""Eyebrows started to go up when it was clear Foal Eagle was going to be protected from the budget cuts of sequestration,"" the official said, referring to the forced federal spending cuts that went into effect in March. The playbook planning began under former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta but was picked up and supported strongly by his successor, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, the official said. Details of the playbook were first reported by the Wall Street Journal. The administration official declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the situation. Opinion: North Korea is far from suicidal . Some moves not scripted . However, some of the U.S. military's reactions to Pyongyang's saber-rattling were not part of the playbook planning. Instead, they arose from concerns about what North Korea has planned as the U.S.-South Korean exercise conclude, the administration official said. For example, the deployment of ballistic missile defenses closer to North Korea and a land-based missile-intercept system to Guam were ordered in recent days when U.S. intelligence began to gather information that North Korea might be planning additional missile launches. A 'complicated, combustible situation' U.S. officials have publicly stressed that the American military moves were also meant to assure the South Koreans that they have Washington's full support. ""What I can tell you is that our response and the mix of assets we have applied to our responses is prudent, logical and measured,"" Pentagon spokesman George Little said earlier this week. ""We are in the midst right now of -- of very important annual exercises that we regularly conduct with the South Koreans, and these exercises are about alliance assurance. They're first and foremost about showing the South Koreans and showing our other allies in the region, including the Japanese, that we are ready to defend them in the wake of threats."" When asked by CNN earlier this week about the ""message"" the United States was trying to send to North Korea, Little said it was the North Koreans who are being provocative. ""The North Koreans -- even before those exercises started -- had undertaken provocative steps, and they've conducted underground nuclear tests, they've conducted missile tests outside their international obligations. So they have a track record now over the past few months of provocative behavior,"" he said. ""We are in the business of ensuring our South Korean allies that we will help defend them in the face of threats,"" Little said in response. ""So I don't think it's a contradiction. I think that North Koreans have engaged in certain actions and have said things that are provocative. We are looking for the temperature to be taken down on the Korean Peninsula."" Hagel hinted at risks in reacting to North Korea, calling the tensions a ""complicated, combustible situation"" that could ""explode into a worse situation."" ""It only takes being wrong once. And I don't want to be the secretary of defense who was wrong once. So we will continue to take these threats seriously. I hope the North will ratchet this very dangerous rhetoric down,"" Hagel said Wednesday. ""But they've got to be a responsible member of the world community. And you don't achieve that responsibility and peace and prosperity by making nuclear threats and taking very provocative actions.""

"(CNN) -- When the sun went down, their voices did not. Riot police on the street in Tehran on Monday. ""Allah O Akbar!"" the crowds on the tops of building chanted over and over. Cell phone footage shows the nighttime scene in Tehran, Iran, which was sent to CNN's iReport. As the camera pans with a jerk from building to building, protesters whistle and shout loudly while cars are heard honking in support. The phrase, which means, ""God is great"" has become a rallying cry for protesting Iranians who have risked their lives and clashed with riot police because they believe the nation's recent presidential election was rigged. Watch iReport video of the protest chorus . CNN spoke with the man who shot the footage. He didn't want to give his name. Doing so might jeopardize his impending escape from Iran and entry into Belgium, he said. He was reached by phone while driving in Tehran Sunday at 10 p.m. ET after he sent the video to iReport's headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. See iReporter's cell phone photos taken Monday in Iran . He described seeing candles across the city which had been lit around 7 p.m. in Iran. Many were placed on rooftops in the memory of a woman known to the world as ""Neda."" A widely circulated video of the young woman shows her apparently in the middle of protests over the weekend with an older man, believed to be her father. It looks as though she is shot in the chest and drops to the ground. Blood runs from the side of her mouth as a few people, including the older man, press on her chest and shout her name. One pleads, ""Do not to be afraid."" The camera closes in on her face as her eyes roll back and are still. She appears to die on camera. Another shocking video sent to CNN's iReport was also filmed from a rooftop, this time looking down at what seems to be an extremely violent scene on the roof of a shorter building. A group of men in black, members of the nation's Basij militia, the iReporter says, appear to gang up on one man and beat him with batons. The footage shows him lying motionless as the men in black walk away. Riot police and Basij militia tried to keep large crowds from congregating in Haft-e Tir Square and on Monday arrested at least eight people, witnesses said. CNN's international desk producers monitor official Web sites of the Iranian government. There has been no reaction to the violence posted on those sites, but the Iranian government has previously said that it does not approve of street protests.

"Washington (CNN) -- A former campaign aide who has accused Republican congressional candidate Carl DeMaio of sexual harassment released the results of an independent lie detector test on Friday in an effort to refute DeMaio's suggestion that he is a suspected criminal. In an exclusive CNN interview aired last week, Todd Bosnich accused DeMaio of sexually harassing him, saying the San Diego Republican even masturbated in front of him. DeMaio denied the allegations, saying they're the cover story of a plagiarist and suspected criminal. Both men are openly gay. DeMaio said Bosnich was fired from his job as campaign policy director for plagiarizing a report. Days later, DeMaio said, Bosnich broke into his campaign office and smashed computers and cut phone lines. Bosnich denied both allegations. On Friday, Bosnich's lawyers sent CNN the results of a lie detector test Bosnich took on Thursday. The test asked whether Bosnich entered DeMaio's headquarters last May on the days when the break-in could have occurred. It also asks whether Bosnich committed ""the alleged illegal activities in Carl DeMaio's campaign headquarters in May of this year?"" Bosnich answered ""no"" to both questions. The report said Bosnich's answers were ""truthful"" and found ""no deception."" Bosnich's attorney, Bibi Fell, said in a statement to CNN that Bosnich took the test ""because of the serious and public allegations Mr. DeMaio has made about Todd."" ""As expected, the polygraph shows that Todd was telling the truth. Todd had nothing to do with the break-in at the DeMaio campaign last May. DeMaio's baseless and malicious criminal accusations re-victimize Todd and deflect from the fact that DeMaio exposed himself to his young staffer,"" Fell said. ""It's time for DeMaio to take responsibility and stop throwing his staffer under the bus."" This is the second polygraph test Bosnich has taken. In June, Bosnich took a lie detector test to support his allegations of sexual harassment, a copy of which Bosnich's attorney provided to CNN. The report said Bosnich's answers were ""truthful"" and found ""no deception."" DeMaio's spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","Todd Bosnich has accused congressional candidate Carl DeMaio of sexual harassment .

"Stuart Rothenberg, who has served as a political analyst for CNN and CBS News, is editor and publisher of The Rothenberg Political Report, a non-partisan political newsletter. Nathan Gonzales is the publication's political editor. North Carolina's Elizabeth Dole was once regarded as a lock for re-election, but now could lose her seat. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Two years ago, as the 2007-2008 election cycle was beginning, one female Republican senator up for re-election looked to be in serious danger: Maine's Susan Collins. But with just three weeks left until Election Day, the moderate Collins now appears to be one of the few embattled Republican senators who could survive the forthcoming Democratic wave. On the other hand, North Carolina's Elizabeth Dole, once regarded as a lock for re-election, looks as if she is about to fall at the hands of Democratic challenger Kay Hagan. How did Dole become more endangered than Collins? First, Collins' campaign understood from the beginning that her opponent, 1st District Democratic Congressman Tom Allen, would be a formidable foe. Allen, a former mayor of Portland, already represents half of the state, and he has the kind of earnest, low-key style that appeals to many Maine voters. Second, Collins understood that she'd get no help from the top of the ticket this year, so she had to raise money and get her message out early. Most neutral observers have expected the eventual Democratic nominee for president to carry Maine this year, since Al Gore carried the state by 5 percentage points in 2000 and John Kerry won it by 9 percentage points four years ago. Third, for whatever reason, Collins has, over the 12 years that she has represented the state in the Senate, developed considerable affection and respect from Maine voters, who see her as independent, hard-working and down to earth. It has been that bond with state voters that has allowed her to weather the current storm that is overwhelming other Republican incumbents. Dole, on the other hand, seemed not to appreciate the threat she faced. Hagan, after all, was not the initially-preferred candidate of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, and the Democratic state senator from Greensboro had first ruled out a bid against Dole before eventually changing her mind. Dole also apparently had trouble accepting that she was vulnerable. Her early poll numbers were strong, after all. But the DSCC spent heavily to attack Dole early, and they succeeded in softening her up. They also hit her on two good issues: her effectiveness (or lack of it) in Washington and the little time that she has spent in the state over the past few years. Finally, Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama is running better in the Tarheel state than most expected, so Dole isn't getting any kind of bump from the presidential race. Voters seem more interested in voting for change than for the more conservative candidate in the presidential and Senate races, and that has made Elizabeth Dole a seriously endangered incumbent. Collins can't yet take her re-election for granted, and Hagan's victory is not yet certain. But Susan Collins appreciated her vulnerability early on and took steps to strengthen her chances for re-election, while Dole was slower to react and was weaker in her positioning than she initially believed.","Elizabeth Dole, once considered a lock for re-election, now seen as likely to lose .

"(CNN) -- Beer's devoted fanbase has been bubbling up ever since its invention in ancient Egypt. The elixir of water, malt, hops and yeast was even made illegal briefly in the U.S. during Prohibition. Today, that passion has come to a head in the form of a craft beer boom. According to the Brewers Association, a craft brewer is defined by being small (six million barrels of beer or less), independent and using traditional ingredients in their beer. The craft beer movement continues to grow at a staggering pace. While overall beer sales dropped slightly, craft beer enjoyed 17.2% growth last year. Despite that upswing, craft beer still only captures 7.8% of the overall beer market, which still leaves plenty of room for industry growth. What to drink on National Drink Beer Day . New craft breweries are opening up all over the country, seeing a 15% increase in 2013. The Brewers Association says that most Americans now live within 10 miles of a craft brewer, so what better way to tap into this movement than by visiting your local craft brewery? The beer cannot get any fresher than directly from the taps at a brewery, and it's a great way to connect with the people who make your favorites. And to top it off, many brewers offer exclusive or small batch beers, which don't make their way into stores or bottles. ""We have seen the craft beer scene exploding in the south,"" says Justin Hall. He's the owner of Southern Beer Tours, a craft beer touring company based in Atlanta. ""Three years ago there were maybe five breweries in the area, and now there are more than 18,"" by Hall's reckoning. Growth in the industry has inspired entrepreneurs like Hall to create business based on craft beer tourism. Hubs like San Diego, the Portlands (both Maine and Oregon) and Asheville, North Carolina, are leading the way as craft beer destinations. Cities like Atlanta are quickly following suit. ""Where this can go over the next 20 years is going to be huge as people's palates change and more and more people begin to appreciate craft beer,"" says Hall. So whether you are heading around the corner to your local brewery or journeying to one of your favorite beer cities, raise a pint today in support of all things beer.","September 28 is National Drink Beer Day .

"(CNN) -- NBC's ""Constantine"" joined the growing party of comic book-based TV series with its Friday night premiere on NBC. But critics couldn't quite agree on whether it was worth staying home (or even DVRing) to catch it. Matt Ryan stars as John Constantine, a rebellious and not very likable exorcist with an affinity for trench coats and cigarettes -- at least, that's how he appears in ""Hellblazer,"" the DC comic book upon which the show is based. To adhere to network standards, Constantine ditches his bad habit for TV, a source of contention for Hitfix.com critic Alan Sepinwall and others. ""The absence of John's most physically self-destructive habit is symbolic of a larger issue,"" he said. ""And as John will tell anyone who listens... symbols have meaning, and when you take them away, you can take away the power they represent."" 'Constantine' adds to TV's comic-book trend . That's not all that worries critics about Constantine, who introduces the real world of demons and ghouls in the premiere. Fans and critics believe Ryan's performance will make this show sink or swim, similar to Hugh Laurie on ""House"" or Benedict Cumberbatch on ""Sherlock."" For some of them, it's not looking good. ""Ryan is a particular problem, I'm sorry to say,"" Vulture's Matt Zoller Seitz said. ""I don't know if he was miscast or poorly directed, but something about his grooming, makeup, and line delivery make him sound like (and sometimes resemble) Jim Carrey in comic high-dudgeon mode."" Others, however, took a more positive view of his performance. ""More cynical than Supernatural's Winchester brothers, almost as quippy as the beloved Buffy, Ryan's Constantine is terrific company for any monstrous apocalypse,"" Matt Roush of TV Guide said. USA Today's Robert Bianco was also in the favorable camp. ""Falling somewhere in the middle of the dark/light scale between Gotham and Flash, tonight's promising premiere boasts a few good jolts, a welcome bit of visual flair, and an appealing star turn from Welsh actor Matt Ryan, who conveys just the right mix of tortured soul, biting wit and hunky hero."" David Wiegand of the San Francisco Chronicle is holding out hope that the show will improve. ""There's good stuff in the pilot â€” the special effects, for one â€” and not-so-good stuff, leaving the question up in the air about whether writers David Goyer and Daniel Cerone, who developed the series, can make the fixes necessary to do justice to Hellblazer. "" Viewers were similarly mixed on Twitter. ""It wasn't mind-blowing,"" comics fan Da Nerdette said. ""The pacing was off at times. But, I enjoyed Matt Ryan as #Constantine. It's worth another chance."" ""The best thing about the show is Matt Ryan's rowdy and committed performance as John Constantine,"" another viewer, David Prush, said on Twitter. ""For a pilot it was very impressive."" What did you think? Will you watch again? Tell us in the comments.","'Constantine,' the latest comic book based series, premiered Friday .

"(CNN) -- The tragic murder of Cpl. Nathan Cirillo by Michael Zehaf-Bibeau -- ""a recent convert to Islam"" as every media outlet in the United States would like to remind you -- has added fuel to the already fiery debate in this country over the inherently violent nature of religion in general, and Islam in particular. It seems that, in the minds of many, the only possible reason a Muslim convert would go on a shooting spree in the Canadian Parliament is because his religious beliefs commanded him to do so. Of course, it could very well be the case that Zehaf-Bibeau was motivated by his Islamic beliefs. It could be that he read a particular passage in the Quran, understood it to mean he should kill as many Canadian government officials as possible, and then went out and did just that. After all, there's no question that a person's religious beliefs can and often do influence his or her behavior. The mistake lies in assuming there is a necessary and distinct causal connection between belief and behavior -- that Bibeau's actions were exclusively the result of his religious beliefs. The notion that there is a one-to-one correlation between religious beliefs and behavior may seem obvious and self-evident to those unfamiliar with the study of religion. But it has been repeatedly debunked by social scientists who note that ""beliefs do not causally explain behavior"" and that behavior is in fact the result of complex interplay among a host of social, political, cultural, ethical, emotional, and yes, religious factors. In the case of Bibeau, his violent behavior could have been influenced as much by his religious beliefs as by his documented mental problems, his extensive criminal past or his history of drug addiction. Yet, because Bibeau was a Muslim, it is simply assumed that the sole motivating factor for his abhorrent behavior was his religious beliefs. Indeed, there's even a term for this idea: Sudden Jihad Syndrome -- an imaginary contagion invented by the neo-conservative commentator Daniel Pipes to describe how any normal-seeming Muslim can suddenly snap for no reason at all and go on a murderous rampage (thus proving Pipes' point that ""all Muslims must be considered potential terrorists""). Strangely, this causal connection between belief and behavior seems not to be as aggressively applied if the criminal in question claims a different religion than Islam. Take the example of the Norwegian terrorist Anders Breivik, who slaughtered 77 people, the majority of them children, in 2011. Breivik explicitly defined himself as a Christian warrior fighting what he called an ""existential conflict"" with Islam. Nevertheless, a great deal of the media coverage surrounding his actions seemed to take for granted that his crime had nothing to do with his Christian identity -- that it was based instead on his right-wing ideology, or his anti-immigrant views, or his neglectful upbringing, or even, as Ayan Hirshi Ali famously argued, because his view that ""Europe will be overrun by Islam"" was being censored by a politically correct media, leaving him ""no other choice but to use violence."" All of the above explanations for Breivik's behavior, including his religious beliefs, are pertinent in understanding the motivations for his behavior. But to argue that Breivik's or Bibeau's actions were motivated solely by their religious beliefs -- or that their religious beliefs necessarily dictated their actions -- is simply irrational. And yet, this trope has become exceedingly common among some critics of religion. Take the following excerpt from the bestselling book ""The End of Faith,"" by the anti-theist activist Sam Harris (Note: because Harris has repeatedly tried to defuse the significance of his argument and has even gone so far as to accuse those, including me, who quote his words of defamation, I will present the passage in its entirety so that there can be no confusion as to his meaning). ""The link between belief and behavior raises the stakes considerably. Some propositions are so dangerous that it may even be ethical to kill people for believing them. This may seem an extraordinary claim, but it merely enunciates an ordinary fact about the world in which we live. Certain beliefs place their adherents beyond the reach of every peaceful means of persuasion, while inspiring them to commit acts of extraordinary violence against others. There is, in fact, no talking to some people. If they cannot be captured, and they often cannot, otherwise tolerant people may be justified in killing them in self-defense."" Harris' argument is that a person's religious beliefs do not merely influence his or her behavior. They determine it. In other words, people holding certain beliefs should be killed, not because those beliefs may lead to violent behavior, but because they necessarily will. Therefore, in order to save ourselves (""self-defense"" Harris calls it) we may be justified in killing the believer before his or her beliefs turn into action -- as they inevitably will. It is true that religious beliefs can often lead to actions that violate basic human rights. It is also true that a great many of those actions are taking place right now among Muslims. But it is ridiculous to claim that the actions of Islamic extremists are either necessarily or exclusively the result of their belief in Islam. There may be millions of Muslims who share the ultra-orthodox, puritanical strain of Islam -- called Salafism -- that fuels the members of ISIS. But the U.S. is not at war with Salafism (if it were we would have bombed Saudi Arabia long ago). It is at war with ISIS, and not because of what they believe, but because of the actions they have carried out based on their interpretation of those beliefs. Arguing otherwise leads to the preposterous conclusion that anyone who shares any measure of religious beliefs with a violent extremist is equally guilty for that extremist's violent actions -- regardless of how diverse the interpretations of those beliefs may be. In fact, Harris makes this exact point: ""Given the link between belief and action, it is clear that we can no more tolerate a diversity of religious beliefs than a diversity of beliefs about epidemiology and basic hygiene."" The danger of this mistaken view of ""the link between belief and action"" is that it makes it that much more difficult to counter religious violence. When we condemn an entire community of faith for sharing certain beliefs with extremists in their community, we end up alienating the very people who are best positioned to counter such extremism in the first place. People should be free to believe whatever they want to believe, no matter how irrational those beliefs may appear to us -- just as people should be free to criticize those beliefs. It is when such beliefs lead to violent behavior that people of all faiths -- as well as those of no faith -- should unite in condemnation.

"(CNN) -- I glanced at the map display on my side of the passenger jet's instrument panel. A small blue circle within 100 miles of the magenta line that defined our course identified the airport in Gander, Newfoundland. This would be our best alternate if our medical problem became an emergency. We were just shy of two hours into our flight from JFK to London when the flight attendant call chime sounded and I picked up the intercom handset. A woman in business class had fainted and was vomiting. A retired physician was attending. The flight attendant promised to keep me updated. With the handset still to my ear, I contemplated the situation and asked, ""Has anyone determined whether the woman has a fever?"" Silence. ""Uh -- crap. No. Good question,"" the flight attendant said. A couple of months ago this would have been a matter of deciding whether we needed a diversionary landing. But this trip was flown just last weekend, and at a time of rampant Ebola paranoia. Fortunately, the story had a happy ending for all concerned. The woman had apparently overmedicated herself before the flight, and had mostly recovered by the time we parked at our arrival gate at Heathrow Airport. Even so, I conveyed the details to our dispatcher while en route, and every step we took was cautious. Paramedics met the aircraft. Passengers were not allowed to deplane until a determination was made as to the status of the ill passenger. Our flight attendants, exhibiting their professionalism, followed the appropriate medical protocols, accessing the in-flight medical kit, and our ""Grab and Go"" kit, which contains items such as latex gloves and clothing to protect responders from contagious bodily fluids. A recent article in The New York Times detailed how Ebola paranoia has indeed permeated the cockpit. Apparently, few pilots are willing to fly Ebola patients out of the hot zones for treatment; one director of an air ambulance service said he knew of only two such pilots in all of Europe. These pilots work for air ambulance or med-evac companies, flying mostly corporate-type jets. Compared with an airliner, these airplanes have more confined cabins and cockpits. I get it. Pilots are a skeptical bunch. When there is room for doubt, we don't necessarily believe the information provided by, say, health officials on subject matters outside our field of expertise. We deal in a world of black and white, where training prepares one to handle contingencies. Our personalities lean toward the control freak side of the scale. Controlling an engine fire is a systematic procedure practiced on almost every recurrent training cycle. Controlling a deadly disease is out of our realm and out of our comfort zone. But pilots are also reasonable. If someone wants us to fly Ebola patients, education and training first would be paramount. Credibility is important: Involve a respected medical professional in the education process and you will have a pilot's attention. Be honest about the risk for cockpit crews, especially if they will have frequent contact with symptomatic patients. A pilot procedure for the transportation of Ebola patients has to be determined right down to the movements and position of the crew, from takeoff to landing. Should crews be required to wear protective clothing? Masks? Goggles? Be doused with chlorine? Remain quarantined for 21 days after each evac trip? Once the standard procedure has been established, then contingencies need to be considered in the event of an in-flight emergency, whether it be mechanical or with the ill patient. In other words, give pilots a checklist to follow -- they are a pilot's bible. They don't cover every circumstance, but they provide a structured guideline. And finally, the air ambulance companies that contract to provide Ebola patient transportation need to compensate their pilots appropriately for the risk. More importantly, it must be mandatory to provide medical treatment if the worst occurs and Ebola infects an employee. The company must accept both the medical and financial responsibility. Regardless, air transportation employees, flying for hours in a cylinder with an infectious patient, are at risk more than the general public. Until more is understood about the source and initial containment of this dangerous disease, most likely my air ambulance colleagues will maintain their apprehensions, and just say ""no."" As for U.S. airlines, the procedures in dealing with the Ebola risk are left to the individual carrier, and the Centers for Disease Control has provided guidance via a linked website. It's more or less common sense, with most of the information educational for managing a potentially infected passenger once airborne. The website also covers the legality of denying boarding to passengers with serious contagious diseases: ""U.S. Department of Transportation rule permits airlines to deny boarding to air travelers with serious contagious diseases that could spread during flight, including travelers with possible Ebola symptoms."" Of course airline personnel would need to know about such an affliction before they could deny a passenger boarding. It's a life and death detail, and one that has been -- and will continue to be -- a deal-breaker for most pilots during a time of Ebola. But for the crews involved directly with Ebola patient transportation, it is still pilots beware.","Les Abend: With ill passenger on recent flight, learning if there was fever was key in Ebola times .

"(CNN) -- Five people died late Sunday in shootings at an apartment complex near Seattle, including the gunman who was shot by police, authorities said. A domestic dispute set off the events, said Brian Wilson, chief of police in Federal Way, Washington. A man got into a fight with a woman with whom he shared an apartment in the Pinewood apartment complex and fatally shot her, he said. The man then went to the parking lot of the apartment complex and fatally shot two men. The relationship between the gunman and the two victims in the lot is unclear, Wilson said. Wilson did not identify the gunman; it was not clear why the identity was withheld. The gunman then returned to his apartment and retrieved a shotgun, he said. Neighbors who had heard the gunfire came into the hallway, and the gunman shot and killed one of those neighbors through an apartment door, Wilson said. Police intercepted the man on his way back to the parking lot, the police chief said. Police ordered the man to drop his weapon, but he refused, so the officers shot him, Wilson said. The man then dropped his weapon, continued to the parking lot and obtained another weapon. Police again ordered him to drop his weapon, he again refused, and police shot and killed him. Eight officers are on administrative leave, as is standard after officers fire at a suspect, Wilson said. The suspect had a valid concealed weapons permit, he said. When officers arrived at the scene in the city just south of Seattle, they could still hear gunfire, said police spokeswoman Cathy Schrock. They also saw two men lying wounded in a parking lot. No officers were injured. CNN's Deanna Hackney contributed to this report.","NEW: Shooting in Federal Way, Washington, began with domestic dispute, police say .

"(CNN) -- A controversial bill that would extend the right to request euthanasia to children suffering terminal illnesses and adults with dementia cleared a vote in a Belgian Senate committee Wednesday. The panel voted 13-4 to allow minors to seek euthanasia under certain conditions, the communications director for the Senate, Patrick Peremans, told CNN. The vote is one stage in a legislative process -- the bill must clear other hurdles before it becomes law. Belgium passed legislation in 2002 allowing voluntary euthanasia for adults. Changes to the law now being considered by lawmakers would allow under-18s to request an end to their life only under stringent guidelines. Dr. Kenneth Chambarae, who is part of the end-of-life research group at Brussels' Free University, specializing in the impact of legalized euthanasia, said the bill explicitly states that it would be possible only for competent minors suffering unbearable physical pain from a serious physical illness without prospect of improvement to request euthanasia. This is different from adults, who can also request it if they are suffering psychologically. Chambarae argues the debate in Belgium is more one of principle than anything else -- that very few children would ever choose euthanasia but that the law now discriminates against them. The bill will now be introduced in the Senate, where it will be debated in a plenary meeting by all senators, Peremans said. If the bill is voted against, this would mean the end of the measure. If it passes, the bill would then be transferred to the House of Representatives for debate. If approved there, it would go to the king to be signed into law. 'Grey zone' Earlier this month, 16 pediatricians wrote an open letter in two national newspapers demanding an extension of the practice. Among them was Gerland van Berlaer, also from Brussels' Free University. ""Doctors do terminate lives of children as well as adults,"" he told CNN. ""But today it's done in a gray zone or in the dark because it's illegal. And this means that there's a lot of room to do things the wrong way."" Dr. Philip Nitschke, director of pro-euthanasia group Exit International, told CNN the Belgians are to be applauded for their progressive thinking on a very difficult issue. However, critics question whether children are capable of making an informed decision on whether to end their own lives. The Netherlands already allows children over the age of 12 to request euthanasia with the consent of their parents. Since the law was introduced in 2002, only five children have chosen to die that way. INTERACTIVE: Euthanasia and the right to die around the world .

"(LifeWire) -- Janice Shih might be the most educated pastry chef you'll ever meet. Janice Shih left her career in medicine at age 38 and became a pastry chef. Shih attended Johns Hopkins University, followed by medical school at George Washington University, then practiced for eight years as an obstetrician/gynecologist before realizing that baking, not medicine, was her calling. ""Everyone would say, 'You're a doctor; it must be so great to be able to save lives,'"" she says. ""But I felt like I was just pushing papers and feeling pressure to see more patients in less time. It was very draining. It just wasn't fun anymore."" So in 2004, at age 38, she swapped her stethoscope for a rolling pin and enrolled in the pastry program at L'Academie de Cuisine in Gaithersburg, Maryland. ""I had always been interested in pastries -- mostly interested in eating them,"" she says with a laugh. Shih now owns Tenzo Artisan, a bakery and catering company in Baltimore that specializes in pastries for people with food allergies -- it's rewarding, she says, to make birthday cakes for people whose dietary sensitivities had forbidden such treats. She's one of thousands of career changers who have left their cubicles for culinary school. Enrollment has risen 40 percent since 2000 at the Culinary Institute of America, and it's up 15 percent this year at The Art Institutes, which operates 30 culinary programs across the country. The trend is helped by a growing cultural interest in gourmet food and a proliferation of cooking-themed TV shows like the Food Network's ""Ace of Cakes"" and Bravo's ""Top Chef."" Plenty of possibilities . Students attending the grueling programs, which can last six to 38 months, can dole out as much as $30,000 to $40,000 for the diploma. And then the real work begins. Neil Robertson, 44, was technical director at a graphic design firm in 2003 and felt like he no longer fit the mold. He quit his 18-year career and attended the French Pastry School in Chicago. ""I've always loved to bake,"" he says. ""But baking in a professional kitchen? I wasn't sure that I could handle it."" In his first professional experience after pastry school, he found out how tough it can be: ""I came very close to tears."" Yet he persevered, and five years later became head pastry chef at Seattle's Canlis restaurant. ""You're not a chef as soon as you finish culinary school,"" says Michael Ruhlman, author of ""The Making of a Chef,"" an inside look at life at the Culinary Institute. ""You're a chef only after spending several years further honing your craft and learning the ropes. To say otherwise would be like saying grads of medical school could instantly be called pediatric neurosurgeons the day after graduation."" And becoming a chef isn't the only option. ""There are so many possibilities today,"" says Culinary Institute President Tim Ryan. ""Catering, sales, manufacturing -- we even have graduates who have launched clothing companies (or) become food scientists."" Jen Beltz, 38, and Thom Householder, 40, testify to that. In 2004, they quit their jobs at AARP and followed their palates to Italy. Using the proceeds of their house sale, the couple attended a five-month culinary program in Florence, then a nine-month course in Canada. All the while, they had no idea where their gastronomic education would take them. ""Some of our friends and family seemed to think we were a bit insane,"" Beltz recalls. But with their newfound culinary know-how, Beltz and Householder launched Front Burner PR, a boutique public-relations and marketing firm in Portland, Maine, that focuses on restaurants, hotels and other food-related clients. Don't quit your day job just yet . Think carefully before writing your resignation letter -- culinary school is no cakewalk, says Robertson. ""It's hot. It's fast. It's high-stress. It's a pressure cooker."" Ruhlman agrees. ""I can't even tell you how many people have read my book and thanked me for saving them from going to culinary school,"" he says, ""because they had no idea how hard it really is."" Before taking the plunge, Robertson and Ruhlman suggest getting a feel for the job via a culinary vacation, like those offered through gourmetontour.com and foodvacation.com, or by shadowing a chef. For the second option, ""go to a restaurant that you like and respect and ask if you can spend a day in the kitchen,"" suggests Ruhlman. It's called trailing, and some restaurants are open to it. If you have some food experience, you might be able to stage (pronounced stauge), which entails working in a kitchen alongside a chef, without pay, for a day or two. ""You get to see what life is really like in a professional kitchen,"" he says, ""and it will really open your eyes."" Looking back, Robertson says leaving his job for the culinary world was a bold move, but worth every deflated soufflé along the way: . ""I'm much more excited about what I'm doing now.""

"(CNN) -- He may have written his name into national folklore less than a week ago but Germany's World Cup winning captain Philipp Lahm has decided to go out at the top by announcing his retirement from international football Friday. The 30-year-old made 113 appearances for ""Die Nationalmannschaft"" over 10 years culminating in Sunday's dramatic extra-time victory over Argentina in the Maracana, Rio de Janeiro. Lahm will continue to play for club side Bayern Munich with whom he extended his contract prior to the tournament in Brazil. In an open letter posted on the German Football Federation (DFB) website Friday, Lahm thanked fans, management and fellow players for ""a wonderful time."" He informed Germany coach Joachim Low of his decision on Monday over breakfast. ""I am happy and grateful that the end of my career end with the national team coincides with winning the World Cup in Brazil,"" he said. The surprise news was met with tributes from across the sporting world and beyond. Lahm was at the center of celebrations as Germany paraded the World Cup trophy to an estimated one million people on the streets of Berlin Monday. Germany coach Joachim Low said: ""Philipp is a model professional who puts the team's success above everything else."" ""His intelligence and versatility as a player have allowed him to play at the highest level on the international stage for many years. ""He is a world-class player, as he again demonstrated over the last few weeks in Brazil. He crowned his outstanding career by winning the World Cup title."" Team manager and former international Germany international striker Oliver Bierhoff added: ""Philipp is an absolute role model as a player and person. ""He is a big personality and happily takes on a great deal of responsibility. ""I have immense respect for Philipp's career and his decision. What remains is for all of us to say a big thank you."" Meanwhile German chancellor Angela Merkel, who was pictured celebrating with the German team after their victory in Brazil, said ""I would like to express to him my utmost respect for what he has done for the national team."" Lahm made his debut for Germany in a 2-1 victory over Croatia in February 2004 and became German captain prior to the 2010 World Cup after injury to then captain Michael Ballack. Traditionally a right sided defender, Lahm has been deployed more often as a central midfielder by Bayern and Germany over the past season. This was a role he played in the early games of the 2014 World Cup before reverting to right back after injury to Shkodran Mustafi. Only three players -- Lothar Matthaus (150 caps), Miroslav Klose (137 caps) and Lukas Podolski (116 caps) -- have made more appearances for the German national team.","Germany captain Philipp Lahm retires from international football .

"(CNN) -- iReporter Nnadozie John Igbokwe sent photos of his mother's traditional Igbo wedding ceremony. Igbokwe, 22, who lives in Belgium, took the pictures at the wedding of his mother Tina Chenenye Ubatu to Ubatu Peter at Umuahia in Abia state in February this year. The traditional ceremony is called Igbankwu, or wine carrying, because it involves the bride carrying a cup of palm wine to her groom. Igbokwe said that prior to the ceremony itself the groom must visit the bride's compound with his father and ask the bride's father's permission to marry her. In this case, the bride's brother took the place of her late father. On a second visit, when a meal is served, the two fathers must discuss a symbolic price for the bride. ""The bride's price is negotiated between the fathers. In most cases there is only a symbolic price to be paid for the bride, in addition to other prerequisites such as kola nuts, goats, chicken, wine,"" said Igbokwe. ""Usually it takes more than one evening before the final bride's price is settled, offering guests from both sides a glamorous feast."" Another evening is taken up when the settlement is paid, before the day of the ceremony itself. Describing the wedding day itself, Igbokwe said: ""The bride's father fills a cup (Iko) with palm wine and passes it on to the girl while the groom finds a place between the guests. ""It is the custom for her to look for her husband while being distracted by the invitees. Only after she has found the groom, offered the cup to him and he has sipped the wine, is the couple married traditionally. ""During this ceremony, there is also the nuptial dance where the couple dances, while guests wish the newly weds prosperity by throwing money around them or putting bills on their forehead.""","Before a traditional Igbo wedding can take place, the fathers negotiate a symbolic price for the bride .

"(CNN) -- Dallas Mavericks star Dirk Nowitzki is a 10-time NBA All-Star and the first European in history to receive the Most Valuable Player award. Born into an extraordinarily athletic family, the 7-foot German dabbled in a variety of sports -- from tennis to soccer -- before finding his calling as a teen. The 32-year-old power forward is now enjoying his 13th year in the NBA and has recently signed a contract worth $80 million over four years -- making him Germany's second highest paid sports star after F1 legend Michael Schumacher. But Dallas is a long way from his small suburban hometown of Wurzburg, in the heart of Germany. Dirk Nowitzki, also known as the ""Dunking Deutschman,"" recently sat down with CNN's Terry Baddoo to talk about his Bavarian roots and his life on and off the court. An edited version of the interview follows: . CNN: How did your upbringing affect your life as an adult? Dirk Nowitzki: My parents were big into sports. My dad was a handball player, and my mom played basketball -- so basically I was in the gym every day. I played all kinds of sports when I was young: tennis, handball, basketball, some soccer. I focused on basketball when I was 16 or 17 and then came to the U.S. when I was 20. CNN: Your parents must be very proud of you? DN: They are my biggest fans. My mom gets so nervous still -- I mean I've been in this league for 13 years and she still can't watch games live. She gets so anxious and when I miss a shot, she's like: ""What's wrong with him? Why's he missing?"" My dad never really played basketball, but now he's my biggest critic. I come home and he's says: ""Why didn't you shoot there? Why didn't you drive?"" CNN: What do you miss about Germany? DN: Just my family really. Everything else nowadays you can get over the internet, like food and that sort of stuff. It's so cold in the winter there, so I'm  glad I miss the whole winter time. But, you know, when I don't see (my sister's) kids for like two to three months, they change so much, and you miss them a lot. That's really the only thing. CNN: You must get a lot of love from German people? DN: Germans are everywhere. Every time I'm on the road somewhere, somebody has a German sign, and Germans come here to visit me a lot. Last year for the All-Star game that was here in Dallas, I had 20 to 25 people come and stay at my house. That was crazy. Every summer I go home and play for the national team and have a lot of followers there so, yeah, they treat me great and hopefully it will continue like that for the last couple of years of my career. CNN: You're the second highest-paid German athlete behind Michael Schumacher. How do you feel about that? DN: It's really nice, I mean Schumacher is obviously the man. What is it -- he's won six championships? And now he finally has this huge comeback with Mercedes -- the German car. He's great. But to me it was never about the money. It's nice to know that I'll never have to worry about money for the rest of my life once I retire, but really that's about it. I never came here for the money. I came here to compete with the best players in the world. CNN: You're more than just a basketball player. Away from the game you play music? DN: Instrument wise I'd been struggling with the saxophone for a long time. Then I had my teeth knocked out and I couldn't really bite on it anymore, so I quit that. I started to play the guitar for a couple of years which was fun. I still bring it out once in a while, could bust out a couple of songs but I'm not very good at it. CNN: You're always flashing a smile on court. Are you always so happy, or is that a misconception? DN: Yeah I like to have fun, but sometimes I do get a little fired up that I have to calm myself down. Off the floor I'm really laid back, like nothing really fazes me too much. But on the floor I do get emotional and a little carried away. However, I started playing when I was 13 to have fun with my teammates, and that never stopped. I enjoy traveling and having fun in the locker room with the guys. Life is too short to be miserable. CNN: What are your remaining goals? Maybe a gold medal at the London 2012 Olympics? DN: I think Olympics-wise, that was my big dream just to get there once -- and we did that in Beijing in 2008. I got to carry the flag for Germany and led my nation into the stadium which, to this day, is one of the greatest days of my life. So to me, that chapter is kind of over and done with. I don't know if I could top that in any way.","German-born NBA star Dirk Nowitzki comes from a very sporty home .

"(CNN) -- Vermont is weighing a bill that could make it the first state to legalize same-sex marriage without being prompted by the courts. Vermont could become the first state to legalize same-sex marriage without prompting from courts. The state's House Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing for Tuesday afternoon to consider a bill that the Vermont Senate passed Monday by a vote of 26-4. The House is expected to pass the bill. Republican Gov. Jim Douglas, however, has said he opposes the bill. ""Governor Douglas agrees with President Obama that marriage is between a man and a woman. He supports Vermont's current civil union law, which provides equal rights, benefits, and responsibilities to Vermonters in civil unions,"" said the governor's spokeswoman, Dennise Casey. The governor ""believes this bill is a distraction from the important work the legislature needs to do to pass a responsible budget and get our economy going again,"" Casey added. It is unclear whether both chambers of the state legislature would vote to override a potential gubernatorial veto. Vermont made history in 2000 by becoming the first state to approve civil unions for gay and lesbian couples. Massachusetts and Connecticut are the only states that allow same-sex marriage. Vermont, New Hampshire, and New Jersey allow civil unions for gay and lesbian couples. Vermont legalized civil unions nine years ago in response to a ruling from its high court. Nationwide, the issue of same-sex marriage remains highly divisive. A June 2008 CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll found that 44 percent of adult Americans believe gay marriage should be recognized by law as valid; 53 percent are opposed. The issue took center stage in the nation's largest state last November, when California voters narrowly approved a proposition amending the state constitution to ban same-sex marriage. California had been issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples since a May 2008 ruling by the state Supreme Court legalized the unions. California's high court heard arguments three weeks ago in a case tackling the constitutionality of the controversial ballot proposition. It has not yet issued a decision.

"(CNN) -- ""Saturday Night Live"" alum Darrell Hammond was stabbed, beaten and subjected to electrical shocks by his mother during his childhood, which led to self-mutilation and hospitalizations during his later life and while he was performing on the hit TV show, he told CNN. ""I was a victim of systematic and lengthy brutality,"" the comedic actor told CNN. ""My mom did some things which have cost me dearly."" Hammond sat down with CNN for an interview for a CNN Comedy segment, but the tone shifted and it became clear that he had serious things to talk about. What was to be a 20-minute chat turned into a 45-minute conversation that ended in tears as he talked about the problems he faced in his childhood and the path he feels it eventually led him down. The actor is well known as the funnyman who graced ""SNL"" to spoof celebrities like Al Gore, Bill Clinton, Donald Trump and Sean Connery. He said there was a darker side that played out in his life, before he became known for those roles, and then later on, backstage before he went out to perform. ""It started to manifest itself when I was 19 years old. That was the first time I ever cut myself,"" he told CNN. Hammond said he was put in psychiatric wards from time to time as doctors struggled to figure out what was happening to him. He said he faced a variety of diagnoses, including bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, and was put on several drugs. While he took them, he called his medications ""soul-killing drugs,"" though he says now he knows they helped stabilize him. ""I was on as many as seven medications at one time,"" he said. ""Doctors didn't know what to do with me."" Hammond says he was medicated almost all of the time he performed on ""SNL"" each week, but that wasn't all that was happening behind the stage doors. ""There was cutting backstage,"" he said, adding that one time, he was taken from the studio to a psychiatric ward because of his actions. ""In fact, the week that I did the Gore debates, I believe I was taken away in a straitjacket."" So how could a man seen by many as a comedic genius, but who was clearly struggling inside, step up each night to deliver some of ""SNL's"" most noted caricatures? In part, Hammond said, he didn't want to let anyone down. "" 'SNL' was a place where if Lorne [Michaels] judges that you can hit the ball over the wall that night, you're going to go out and step up to the plate,"" he said. ""I didn't want to let Lorne down, who I was close to."" Hammond also spoke of the troubles he faced with his father, who struggled after fighting in a war and dealing with what he had seen. Though he said his father never abused him the way his mother did, it was difficult for Hammond to be around him. The actor said he had trouble playing John McCain in ""SNL"" skits because he related to McCain's torture. His father was eager to see his son play the onetime Republican presidential candidate and was unaware of Hammond's difficulty in taking on the role, because he was not aware of the torture his son went through, Hammond said. Despite the relationships he had with his parents, both of their deaths were tough on him, he said. Hammond, who has not previously talked about a lot of the troubles in his childhood and during his famed career, has written a book titled ""God If You're Not Up There, I'm F-ked,"" in which he reveals some of his addictions throughout the years. Hammond says he is not hiding his problems anymore. ""I don't feel ashamed of falling down, because I got hit by a Mack truck,"" he said. ""The fact is, I kept trying to get back up, and then I did."" NBC had not responded to a request for comment at the time of publication.

"Washington (CNN) -- Four State Department officials have been disciplined in the wake of a review of the security failures that led to the deaths of four Americans at the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, a department spokeswoman said Wednesday. One resigned, while three others have been placed on administrative leave and relieved of their duties, said State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland. The independent review released Tuesday examining attacks that occurred last September 11 cites ""systemic failures and leadership and management deficiencies"" at the State Department. The failures resulted in a security plan ""that was inadequate for Benghazi and grossly inadequate to deal with the attack that took place,"" the 39-page unclassified version of the report concludes. Read the full report . Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens was among those killed in Benghazi. Eric Boswell, assistant secretary of diplomatic security, resigned, effective immediately, Nuland said. Deputy Assistant Secretary for Diplomatic Security Charlene Lamb is among the officials placed on administrative leave, a source told CNN. Earlier Wednesday, a senior official had told CNN that Lamb and another State Department official had resigned as well. Boswell and Lamb oversaw security for the Benghazi mission. Lamb testified before Congress about the security precautions. Documents show Lamb denied repeated requests for additional security in Libya. Veteran diplomat Thomas Pickering, who was chairman of the review board, said the members placed primary blame ""at the assistant secretary level, which is in our view the appropriate place to look, where the decision making, in fact, takes place. Where, if you like, the rubber hits the road."" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who was recovering from a stomach virus and concussion, ordered the review in the aftermath of the attack. Such reports are mandated by Congress when Americans working on behalf of the U.S. government are killed overseas. Clinton is expected to appear before the House Foreign Affairs Committee about the Benghazi attack next month, Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Florida, the outgoing chairwoman of the committee, told CNN. Read Clinton's letter to Rep. Ros-Lehtinen . Deputy Secretaries of State William Burns and Thomas Nides were to testify Thursday before the House and Senate committees. Pickering and former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen, the review board's vice chairman, visited Capitol Hill Wednesday to brief members of the House Foreign Affairs and Senate Foreign Relations committees in private. ""The report makes clear the massive failure of the State Department at all levels, including senior leadership, to take action to protect our government employees abroad,"" said House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, a Michigan Republican. Sen. John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, who is considered the top prospect for the secretary of state job being vacated by Clinton, said the State Department ""has taken a huge step forward to address the lessons learned from Benghazi."" ""It's a dangerous world we're in, and I think that this report is going to significantly advance the security interests of those personnel and of our country,"" Kerry told reporters Wednesday. Red Clinton's letter to Sen. Kerry . A CNN/ORC poll conducted Monday and Tuesday suggests most Americans are dissatisfied with how the Obama administration has handled the aftermath of the attack, but a majority believe that the administration did not attempt to intentionally mislead the American public about that attack. Four in 10 Americans believe that inaccurate statements by administration officials after the Benghazi attack were intended to mislead the public, while 56% said they thought those statements reflected what the Obama administration believed to be true at the time. In all, 43% said they are satisfied with the way the Obama administration has handled the matter in the past few months; half said they are dissatisfied. The review board cited a lack of resources as at least partly to blame for the deaths in Benghazi. ""The solution requires a more serious and sustained commitment from Congress to support State Department needs,"" it said. The board found that Washington tended ""to overemphasize the positive impact of physical security upgrades ... while generally failing to meet Benghazi's repeated requests"" to beef up personnel. The board completed its investigation this week and sent a copy Monday to Clinton, who said in letters to the heads of the Foreign Affairs and Foreign Relations Committees that she accepted all of its 29 recommendations. They include strengthening security, adding fire-safety precautions and improving intelligence collection in high-threat areas. The report says ""there was no protest prior to the attacks,"" which were described as ""unanticipated in their scale and intensity."" It also cites the Bureau of Diplomatic Security staff as ""inadequate"" in Benghazi on the day of the attacks and in the months and weeks leading up to it, ""despite repeated requests from Special Mission Benghazi and Embassy Tripoli for additional staffing."" The report says there had been a ""lack of transparency, responsiveness, and leadership at the senior levels"" in Washington, Tripoli and Benghazi. CNN Poll: Majority dissatisfied but don't think administration misled on Benghazi attack . ""Security in Benghazi was not recognized and implemented as a 'shared responsibility' by the bureaus in Washington charged with supporting the post, resulting in stove-piped discussions and decisions on policy and security,"" it says. ""That said, Embassy Tripoli did not demonstrate strong and sustained advocacy with Washington for increased security for Special Mission Benghazi."" The report says the short-term nature of the mission's staff, many of whom were inexperienced U.S. personnel, ""resulted in diminished institutional knowledge, continuity and mission capacity."" The mission was also ""severely under-resourced with regard to certain needed security equipment,"" it says. It singles out for criticism dependence on ""poorly skilled"" members of the Libyan February 17 Martyrs' Brigade and unarmed local guards who were supposed to provide security. It noted that, at the time of Stevens' visit, militia members ""had stopped accompanying Special Mission vehicle movements in protest over salary and working hours."" Though it said there had been no specific, credible threats on the day of the attack, the significance of the anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001 had led Stevens to hold meetings on the compound on September 11 of this year. But security systems and the Libyan response ""fell short"" when the compound was penetrated ""by dozens of armed attackers."" The report presents a detailed description of what happened that night. It says Libyan mission guards were not present, local militia fled their posts and ""there simply was not enough time for armed U.S. military assets to have made a difference."" The board said it could not determine how a gate at the compound was breached, ""but the speed with which attackers entered raised the possibility"" that the guards had left it open. The politics surrounding the events that led to the report have claimed one political casualty, with Susan Rice, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, last week pulling her name from consideration to succeed Clinton. Some Republican senators had said they would put a hold on her nomination if President Barack Obama had submitted it, based on comments, later determined to have been inaccurate, that Rice made in the days after the attack.

"(CNN) -- The art of portraiture, once reserved for the rich, the royal and the holy, has found a new mass appeal online. Matt Held is painting 200 Facebook photos and giving them to the subjects. Some avid social-network users are commissioning artists to create small digital images to represent themselves in the online world. Other Internet-savvy people use automated computer programs and Web sites to generate posterized likenesses of themselves. Matt Held, a 38-year-old painter in Brooklyn, New York, has gained Internet celebrity for painting peoples' Facebook photos and then giving them to his subjects. And some identity researchers are trying to take the online portrait beyond images of people's faces entirely. All of these efforts underscore the fact that tiny images, often no bigger than a postage stamp, have become stand-ins for peoples' identities online.   On the Web, people can recreate themselves in any way they choose. Unlike in the real world, where portraits are largely reserved for museums and the mantels of self-centered celebrities, online portraits are either free or relatively inexpensive. They're also essential for effective Internet communication, said Judith Donath, a fellow at Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet & Society. ""In the physical world, there's a lot of effort people make in terms of how they look when they go out to walk down the street. Some people spend two hours to get ready going to the grocery store,"" she said. ""In the physical world, there's the actual self, so you're not entirely dependent on a portrait."" On the Internet, though, people can create their appearance through images they choose to represent themselves, she said. Donath is working with a group of students from the MIT Media Lab to take online portraiture beyond realistic-looking faces. In the future, she says, people will create pictures of themselves with the data trails they leave online. Visit the ""Personas"" project and type in your name to see how this might work. Donath said many people online are drawn to the fact that they don't have to look like the person they are in the real world. But this is also a sticking point in the world of online portraiture, said Dan Schawbel, a personal branding expert and author of a book called ""Me 2.0."" People should brand themselves online with a single professional photo that they display on all of their social networks so that strangers will be able to identify them, he said. ""Seeing the same thing again and again and again is going to make you remember it,"" he said, adding that photographs of human faces are more emotional and memorable than drawings or other obscured representations. Erika Peterman would disagree. The 39-year-old in Tallahassee, Florida, paid $100 for local artist Lee Bretschneider to draw a caricature of Peterman as a comic book hero. She uses that image on her blog and on Facebook. ""I do think an illustration is a way to unleash some fantasy aspect of yourself or maybe the way you'd like other people to see you,"" she said. Peterman, who blogs about comics and has read them since she was young, said her stylized comic-book image says something about her and is more compelling than a standard photo. She said she's not trying to hide anything behind the drawing. ""I look how I look and I'm not fooling anybody,"" she said. ""If the artist had me looking like Halle Berry, that'd be ridiculous."" Joel Watson, who illustrates an online comic book series from Dallas, Texas, said he's gotten so many requests from fans asking him to draw avatars for their online social networks that he can't keep up with the demand. He said some clients came back to him several times wanting new drawings because they had shaved off their hair or somehow changed their look. Each of these efforts cost $50 to $100, he said. Several free Web sites offer to posterize a person's Facebook or Twitter icons, or let users assemble cartoon versions of themselves. The latest to catch on in a big way is a spin-off of the AMC show ""Mad Men."" On a site called MadMenYourself.com, people create stylized images of themselves as sleek advertising executives from the 1960s, in keeping with the show's theme. Dyna Moe, the 31-year-old New York artist who created the character components for the site, said at first she was ""creeped out"" to see so many computerized versions of her drawings floating around social networks. On Twitter, where tiny square icons stand in for a person's identity, it also became difficult to tell who some people were because the Mad Men icons all started to look similar, she said. It had a ""hall of mirrors feeling,"" she said. The Web site had 8 million viewers the first week it launched, she said. MG Siegler, a blogger at TechCrunch, said his fans and friends found it jarring when he took down a photo from his social networks and replaced it with a ""Mad Men"" avatar. ""They're like, 'Oh, what's going on here? Is there some sort of life change that you switched up your icon for?' "" he said. ""It's kind of funny that people do very much pay attention to them. I think people start to associate your identity with your [Twitter] icon,"" he said. Held, the painter in Brooklyn, is completing a series of 200 Facebook portraits. He chooses his subjects from a Facebook fan page called ""I'll have my Facebook portrait painted by Matt Held,"" where more than 6,400 people have signed up. The project struck a surprising chord with people and helped pull him out of a lull in his career, Held said. While people in his paintings can use the images online free, he sells the canvas works in galleries for $1,800, he said. ""Portraiture in itself has always been there, but I want to bring it out to the masses,"" he said. ""There are so many people out there with awesome photos and awesome stories who I feel need to be painted.""","The portrait, a centuries-old art form, is finding new life with the masses online .

"COLORADO SPRINGS, Colorado (CNN) -- A megachurch paid a 20-year-old man to keep silent about a sexual relationship he had with disgraced evangelical pastor Ted Haggard, a senior church pastor said. Rev. Ted Haggard was fired from New Life Church after allegations about a prostitute and drug use arose in 2006. Haggard, who was fired amid allegations that he used drugs and patronized a male prostitute in 2006, had a sexual relationship with a second man -- a 20-year-old volunteer at his megachurch, the Rev. Brady Boyd, a senior pastor at the church, said Monday. The church agreed to pay the man in exchange for his pledges not to talk publicly about the relationship, Boyd said, referring to a settlement reached by the man's lawyer and the church's insurance company. Under the settlement, the church provided the man money to pay his college tuition, moving expenses and counseling, Boyd said. ""This was compassionate assistance. It was to help him move forward, not a settlement to keep him quiet,"" said Boyd, senior pastor at New Life Church in Colorado Springs, Colorado.  Watch Haggard in the HBO documentary » . Haggard founded New Life in his basement in 1984 and oversaw its growth to an influential megachurch with roughly 15,000 members. Haggard is the former president of the National Association of Evangelicals, a group that says it represents millions of people in 45,000 church congregations nationwide. He and other evangelical leaders participated in weekly conference calls with senior White House aides during the Bush administration. In November 2006, allegations surfaced that Haggard had a three-year relationship with Mike Jones, a male escort, involving drugs and sex for money. After those allegations became public, New Life fired Haggard and he resigned as president of the national organization. On Friday, New Life Church announced Haggard's relationship with the volunteer in a letter to the congregation. In the last three weeks, Boyd said, the young man told him that he was considering going public with his story because Haggard was portraying himself as a victim in an upcoming HBO documentary called ""The Trial of Ted Haggard,"" which is scheduled to air Thursday. ""I counseled him it wasn't going to help him or the church's healing. Plus it was in violation of the agreement we signed with them,"" Boyd said. An interview with the former volunteer is scheduled to air Monday evening on KRDO-TV of Colorado Springs, Colorado. Haggard is scheduled to appear on CNN's ""Larry King Live"" on Thursday night. The 2006 controversy involving Haggard erupted when Jones, the former prostitute, said the pastor had paid him for sex over three years and had used methamphetamine in his presence. Haggard said in interviews that he received a massage from Jones, but denied having sex with him. He also said he bought methamphetamine, but threw it away instead of using it. The assertions received widespread news coverage and sparked charges of hypocrisy, particularly because Haggard had condemned homosexual sex in a documentary called ""Friends of God."" In a settlement with New Life, the church and Haggard agreed that he would retain his six-figure salary for a year, leave the Colorado Springs area, receive counseling, and not speak publicly about what had happened for one year, according to a church staff member with knowledge of the settlement who was not authorized to speak on the record. Jones said Monday that he has spoken with the former church volunteer whom Boyd said had a relationship with Haggard. ""My anger is so much at the church,"" Jones said. ""They tried to keep this quiet when all along I've taken a beating feeling like I was the only one, when clearly there were others."" Despite the fresh scandal, Boyd said he is hopeful for the future. ""We've added 1,500 people in the last 18 months,"" he said. ""We're trying to adopt 100 orphans into families in the church. ""We had a leader with flawed character and we're trying to clean up from the residue of the past. This will not always define us. I can promise you that in the days ahead, we won't be identified with scandal, but helping the widows and orphans.""","Rev. Ted Haggard was fired after drug, male prostitute allegations in 2006 .

"(CNN) -- A former commercial pilot has been found guilty of charges that he was intoxicated while co-piloting a flight from Austin, Texas, to Denver in 2009, a federal prosecutor announced Tuesday. Aaron Jason Cope, 32, was found guilty of operating a common carrier under the influence of alcohol and faces up to 15 years in prison and a fine of as much as $250,000, according to a statement from John F. Walsh, U.S. attorney for the District of Colorado. The conviction was handed down by District Court Judge John R. Tunheim last week after a bench trial June 6-7. Cope was the first officer aboard United Express Flight 7687 on the morning of December 8, 2009. According to court documents, the flight's captain, Robert Obodzinski, testified that although his co-pilot ""appeared to be thinking and speaking clearly, every few minutes during the flight (Obodzinski) detected an unusual odor, which he eventually concluded was the smell of an alcoholic beverage."" When the plane arrived in Denver, Obodzinski testified, he ""leaned over and took a big whiff"" and determined that the odor was coming from Cope. Cope had been the ""monitoring"" pilot on the flight and thus had not manipulated the plane's controls. However, he was scheduled to fly the Embraer 170 aircraft on the next flight. The Embraer 170 has a seating capacity of 70 to 80 people. Once Cope returned to the cockpit after conducting a post-flight inspection, Obodzinski reportedly told him, ""if you have any problem taking a Breathalyzer, call off sick and get out of here,"" to which Cope replied, ""Well, I guess I better call off sick then."" Obodzinski, who had been on the phone with superiors while Cope was doing the inspection, was directed by his company to escort the co-pilot to an alcohol testing facility in Denver International Airport's main terminal, according to trial documents. There, his blood alcohol content was found to be 0.094%, more than twice the FAA-prohibited level of 0.04% for any crew member of a civil aircraft. Republic Airways prohibits any crew member from working with a blood alcohol level above 0.02%. At the testing facility, according to testimony, Cope admitted that he had gone to a bar with a friend and also bought beer from a gas station near the hotel where he, Obodzinski and two flight attendants had stayed the previous night. United Express is the name under which several regional airlines operate flights for United Airlines. Flight 7687 was operated by Shuttle America, which is a subsidiary of Republic Airways Holdings.","Aaron Jason Cope, 32, was the monitoring pilot aboard the December 2009 flight .

"London, England (CNN)  -- Three aid groups called Thursday for an immediate halt to any new adoptions of Haitian children after last week's earthquake. Save the Children, World Vision and a unit of the British Red Cross said the focus first must be on tracing any family members that children may still have and reuniting them. ""Any hasty new adoptions would risk permanently breaking up families, causing long-term damage to already vulnerable children, and could distract from aid efforts in Haiti,"" the agencies said in a joint statement. Full coverage | Latest news updates | Twitter updates . The disaster in Haiti has led to an outpouring of support around the world, with the United States alone donating more than $305 million as of Wednesday, according to the Chronicle of Philanthropy, a newspaper covering nonprofit organizations. Stories of Haitian orphanages struggling after the quake and the plight of the children there also has led many to ask about adopting children. After reading a CNN report on Haitian orphans, CNN.com reader Dana Fanning wrote, ""It broke my heart. My husband and our 4 children want to know if and how we could adopt [any] of the children orphaned by the earthquake."" List of missing, found | Are you there? | Impact Your World . Save the Children Chief Executive Jasmine Whitbread said the ""vast majority"" of children on their own in Haiti are not orphans, but were simply separated from their families in the chaos. Their family members may still be alive, she said, and ""will be desperate to be reunited with them."" ""Taking children out of the country would permanently separate thousands of children from their families -- a separation that would compound the acute trauma they are already suffering and inflict long-term damage on their chances of recovery,"" Whitbread said. Allowing a flood of new adoptions also could open the door to traffickers, said World Vision Chief Executive Justin Byworth. The poverty in Haiti already makes children there ""extremely vulnerable"" to exploitation and abuse, Byworth said. ""We are concerned not only about premature overseas adoption but also about children increasingly being sent unaccompanied to the Dominican Republic,"" he said. Aid groups said adoptions that were already in progress before the January 12 earthquake should go ahead, as long as the right legal documents are in place and they meet Haitian and international law. For those who want to help Haitian children, Whitbread said, they should donate to aid agencies who are working on reuniting those children with their families. The International Committee of the Red Cross has opened an office at the headquarters of the Haitian Red Cross in Crois de Prez to help people locate their relatives, said Pete Garratt, a disaster response manager at the British Red Cross. The ICRC also has set up a Web site to help people searching for relatives, he said.","Three aid groups say focus first must be on reuniting kids with any of their relatives .

"(CNN) -- The familiar string intro filled the room. The happy couple stepped onto the dance floor. And as they took each other's arms, Etta James' voice began to tell the story of their marriage. ""At last ... "" ""We had waited so long to meet the right person,"" recalled Jennifer Macdonel of Sugar Land, Texas, who married her husband, Rudy, in March 2010. She was 32, and he was 41. ""It seemed as if everyone we knew was already married, or had been married before. Just when we thought that we had kissed every frog left in the universe and given up on true love, we met."" It's a fairy tale scene that's been witnessed at thousands of weddings since James' recording of the classic, romantic song ""At Last"" was released in 1961. And though James died on January 20 at age 73, her legacy lives on in couples around the world. After her death, many of them paid tribute to the woman who described their relationships like no one else could. When the Macdonels heard that James had died, they honored her by rewatching their wedding video and dancing under the stars to the song she made famous. ""No other song could possibly capture the story behind our love, and the very long journey that we endured until we finally met,"" Jennifer Macdonel said. ""Etta James will forever live deep in our souls, as every time we watch our wedding video and hear that song, we will be reminded of our special day."" Many other couples chose ""At Last"" as their song for the same reason. ""My wife and I were born just a month apart in 1977 across the world,"" said Nicholas Montana, an American whose wife, Leily Vassigh-Montana, is from Iran. ""It wasn't 'til we were both at the age of 30 did we meet and marry six months later. 'At Last' seemed like a song that was meant to be, just like our intertwining fates."" Nicholas hadn't heard the song before the couple had to choose a piece for their first dance as husband and wife, but ""was taken by its emotional character and lyrics. Little did I know it was such a popular wedding song, and rightfully so,"" he said. The pair were married in April 2008 and now live in Miami. ""We wish [James'] family to be proud that she was able to bring so much joy to many couples around the world,"" he added. For other couples, the song was a humorous nod to long courtships that their families thought would never end at the altar. When Kimberly Griffiths and her husband, Richard Cicciarelli, stepped onto the dance floor to the first strains of ""At Last,"" their wedding guests burst out laughing. The pair had dated for nine years before finally getting married in July 2008 in upstate New York. ""As the music started and the first words of 'At Last' blasted over the speakers, everyone laughed and clapped because they all knew it was a long journey for us,"" Griffiths said. ""It was the perfect fit. It was one of my favorite songs,"" she said. ""It's so soulful and tells exactly how I feel about the relationship with my husband. ... No one could reproduce the feeling that Etta conveys when she sings it."" ""At Last"" was the soundtrack to Tina and Craig Wehrbein's engagement and wedding, so of course they had to go see James live when she performed in their city of Omaha, Nebraska, in 2007. ""We couldn't wait to go see her sing our song live on stage,"" Tina wrote. ""She was in her late sixties at the time, but wow -- what an entertainer she was! I was pregnant with our second child when we saw her, but that didn't stop me from enjoying the concert like a teenager!"" Another couple had a different kind of message in mind when they chose ""At Last"" for their wedding. Jasmine Brown-Denny married her husband, Randy Denny, in September 2009. The Brooklyn, New York, couple chose the song because it seemed to describe their relationship -- and to honor President Barack Obama. ""The song also signified the inauguration of the first African American president,"" Brown-Denny said. ""We were both big supporters of President Obama and his campaign and excitedly watched several inauguration balls where the song played prominently."" She remembers staying up all night watching the president and first lady Michelle Obama dance the night away at the inaugural balls. ""When we chose the song, we had the first family in mind."" And for Jenn Greenberg, ""At Last"" was always her wedding song. She knew from the time she was 10 years old that it would be played at her wedding. ""My mom would play this song, as a record, when I was a little girl and I thought it was so romantic,"" said the Epping, New Hampshire, resident. ""I would listen to it and piece together all the traits and things that would make the perfect husband. I've always known that 'At Last' would be the song I'd want to use as my wedding song with my husband."" In June 2006, Greenberg married her husband, Dave, and finally got to dance to her -- and thousands of couples' -- perfect wedding song. All thanks to Etta James.","Etta James' classic ""At Last"" is a popular wedding song .

"Washington (CNN) -- Tuesday was the first day same-sex weddings could  be performed in the District of Columbia. Last week, D.C. was added to the list of those few states that permit gay marriage. A law passed in December and signed by the mayor went into effect when Congress (which has the power to reject D.C. laws) refrained from interfering. Likewise, Chief Justice John Roberts refused an application to the U.S. Supreme Court to block the gay marriage law from going into effect, on procedural grounds, saying that the legal challenge was premature. This should not be viewed as a ringing endorsement from the high court for gay marriage or for protecting the privacy rights of gay people. Only two months ago, in January, the Supreme Court was not so hands-off in gay-marriage-related cases. Twice, the court intervened in cases in which active opponents of gay marriage, in California and Washington, have claimed that their right to privacy will be invaded if they are not given legal protection to be unseen and anonymous. In the California case, the high court ruled to prevent the broadcast of videotaped trial testimony of the organizers of Proposition 8, which bans same-sex marriage. In the Washington case, which the court agreed to hear in full this year, the issue is whether the names on public petitions can be sealed. More than 130,000 signatures had been gathered by gay-marriage opponents in that case as part of an effort to place a referendum on the ballot to overturn a state domestic partnership law. To those of us who strongly favor equal marriage rights -- and who have a personal stake in them -- providing cover to those who would keep those rights from us feels a little like a drive-by assault: We had a glance at the people attacking us, but now they are gone, not to be identified. Another privacy interest is at stake in the gay marriage cases, and it will be interesting to see whether the Supreme Court embraces it with the same zeal demonstrated with respect to opponents of gay marriage. This month, now that the D.C. gay marriage law has gone into effect, my domestic partner of more than 12 years and I will wed. With our marriage will come a bundle of rights, making us equal under the law to our heterosexual peers. More fundamentally, we will be able to have our loving commitment to each other officially recognized, like any other committed couple. And in terms of personal privacy, no longer will I have to indicate my sexual orientation to anyone who asks me whether I am married, as I can thereafter simply answer ""yes"" rather than explain that I have a ""domestic partner,"" the well-understood code that one is in a gay relationship. The marriage license the Superior Court is providing us will include the right to privacy in our relationship. I am not closeted, but it is part of my right to privacy to choose with whom I share the information about my sexual orientation. Indeed, that is what the California Supreme Court ruled in declaring equal marriage rights for gays and lesbians. That decision was what led to Proposition 8 and the invalidation of the court's ruling and, now, the equal protection lawsuit on trial in federal court in San Francisco to overturn the Proposition 8 ban. In its original ruling, the California court adopted an argument advanced in a brief filed by the Anti-Defamation League that I helped to write. The U.S. Supreme Court has found that opponents of gay marriage who supported Proposition 8 -- and whose testimony will be offered in San Francisco trial to show a discriminatory animus relevant to the equal protection issue -- are entitled under their right to privacy not to have their testimony videotaped for public viewing. The Supreme Court cited the potential harassment of the witnesses if their testimony is shown. The harassment argument also is being made about the signers of the petition in Washington state on gay marriage, who claim the right to have their names removed from public view. (That case admittedly, is more complicated, as petition signing has attributes of voting, where one's vote is private.) The difference in the privacy rights afforded gay couples and those who worked to ban gay marriage is obvious. The opponents are people who chose to involve themselves in a public debate, to enter the public square. Indeed, my domestic partner and I were stopped at an intersection in San Diego in the run-up to Proposition 8 and were bombarded with placard-waiving, Proposition 8-supporting protesters, their signs condemning gay people as deviants. (Those are the kind of folks I would rather simply inform, if asked, that I am married rather than in a ""domestic partnership"" and thus avoid their scorn and preserve my privacy, defined by Justice Louis Brandeis as the ""right to be let alone."") Gay couples, on the other hand, did not choose to be gay or have society prevent them from enjoying equal marriage rights, forcing them to self-identify when they are asked whether they are married. As a litigator, I know that televising a trial can indeed create a circus atmosphere if it is not carefully controlled. On the other hand, filtering what goes on in a courtroom through the printed word only deprives people of the opportunity to see what really goes on -- to judge demeanor and motive, which will be especially important in understanding the testimony of the Proposition 8 supporters. The judge in the trial of Proposition 8 appeared to strike a balance, to avoid a circus, by allowing only delayed videotape access to coverage of the trial. The Supreme Court disagreed. In the first privacy ruling in the California gay marriage case, the Supreme Court declared itself in favor of privacy for opponents of gay marriage. When the case comes back to it on the merits, as it surely will, let's hope that other privacy issue, as well as the equal protection issue, finds similar support. In the meantime, my domestic partner and I each look forward this spring to answering the question ""Are you married?"" with a simple ""yes."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Christopher Wolf.","Gay weddings start today in D.C., as high court declined to block them .

"Washington (CNN) -- Transgender groups are applauding a court ruling in favor of a Georgia woman who sued after claiming she was fired from her state position because of a sex change. A federal appeals court in Atlanta concluded transgender workers are protected under the Constitution. Vandiver Elizabeth Glenn was a legislative editor in the Georgia General Assembly . ""The question here is whether discriminating against someone on the basis of his or her gender non-conformity constitutes sex-based discrimination under the Equal Protection Clause,"" said the three-judge panel. ""We hold that it does."" The 19-page ruling came last week, not long after the court heard oral arguments in Atlanta, a very fast turnaround in such an appeal. Glenn -- who was once known as Glenn Morrision -- alleged she was told she was let go because her 2005 decision to transition from male to female would be viewed as ""immoral"" by state lawmakers. Her boss also objected to Glenn showing up at an office Halloween party dressed as a woman, and asked Glenn to leave. A federal judge later concluded Glenn's supervisor believed the gender reassignment was inappropriate, disruptive and would make her co-workers uncomfortable. The judge, when ruling for Glenn, had said she could return to work, but delayed that until the appeals court ruled. Monday's decision means she could be back on the job within days. State attorneys had argued no discrimination laws were broken since protections extended to certain classes of individuals did not include transgender employees. The appeals panel said the reasons cited by the state in its defense were not acceptable. ""An individual cannot be punished because of his or her perceived gender non-conformity,"" said the ruling. ""Because these protections are afforded to everyone, they cannot be denied to a transgender individual."" The court added, ""For example, courts have held that plaintiffs cannot be discriminated against for wearing jewelry that was considered too effeminate, carrying a serving tray too gracefully, or taking too active a role in child-rearing."" Among the judges who supported the woman, who now goes by Vandy Beth Glenn, was William Pryor, one of the most conservative federal appeals judges. He was named to the court by President George W. Bush in 2005. The state has the option of appealing to the Supreme Court for review. The case is Glenn v. Brumby (10-14833).","Transgender workers are protected under the Constitution, a judicial panel rules .

"(CNN) -- Stronger sanctions should have been taken against the Serbian Football Association, according to FIFA president Sepp Blatter -- who said that ""zero tolerance"" policies against racism need to be upheld. The Serbian FA was fined $105,000 by UEFA on Thursday following an Under-21 match where opposing England players said they were racially abused. The fine was less than the punishment handed to a player at the Euro 2012 finals for exposing undershorts bearing the logo of a betting company. European soccer's body also banned two Serbian coaches and a total of six players from both sides, while also ordering the eastern European nation to play its next competitive Under-21 match behind closed doors. UEFA was widely criticized, especially in England, for not taking a stronger stance -- and it was reported in the UK press that president Michel Platini might seek to appeal his own organization's ruling. ""Not only racism, but discrimination has no place in football and there is zero tolerance for it,"" Blatter told reporters at a press conference in Japan on Saturday. ""I just learned yesterday what the (Serbia) decision was and I'm sure we will also take it up with UEFA at the level of governance, that there should be in all football, with every confederation and all national associations strong, harsh punishment when it comes to racism and discrimination."" Blatter told CNN last year that racism on the pitch could be ""settled with a handshake"" but following the furore those comments caused he has pledged his commitment to battling the problem. ""I will take up a discussion with the president of UEFA, but I don't know if he has an influence on his disciplinary committee,"" the 76-year-old said in Tokyo when asked about the Serbia-England case. ""We will ask for details of the file but I repeat we have it in our organization that there must be very, very strong, strong punishment."" In a wide-ranging press conference following Friday's FIFA executive committee meeting, Blatter also addressed concerns about security at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil following the midweek problems at a top South American club match in Sao Paulo. The second leg of the Copa Sudamerica final was abandoned at halftime after visiting Argentine team Tigres claimed they had been threatened with guns by security officials as they left the pitch. Sao Paulo has experienced a drastic rise in crime this year, and Brazil has boosted its security budget in order to quell concerns that visiting fans will not be safe. ""Such an incident I have to say is also a warning for the organizers in the World Cup -- a warning for all organizers about what will happen,"" said Blatter, who is in Japan for the Club World Cup, which climaxes with Sunday's final between Brazilian team Corinthians and European champions Chelsea. ""Security is not a matter of sports organizers, it's a matter of the authorities, police, army, whatever as we have no power in football to change security,"" Blatter added. He said world football's governing body had given Indonesian soccer authorities a ""Christmas gift"" by agreeing to a new deadline to resolve a two-year power conflict. The Indonesian Football Association (PSSI) is battling for control with the breakaway Indonesian Soccer Rescue Committee (KPSI) -- a struggle that has been brought to prominence by the death of a Paraguayan player who was owed four months' wages. Diego Mendieta died in hospital after contracting an illness, having been unable to return home to his family due to lack of funds after his contract expired. ""It has been two years now, two years that they have tried to put together the two parts of the football organizations, but they couldn't do it,"" Blatter said. ""They have asked for another three months to be given, until March next year, and also the Asian Football Confederation was advocating that. I think it was quite a Christmas gift to Indonesia that they haven't been suspended. ""They have a league but the players of that league cannot play in the national team. Something is wrong. ""Since 2011 we have tried to bring together these two different halves of Indonesian football. We have given until the next meeting of the Executive Committee on the 20th and 21st of March next year to bring their house in order.""","Head of world football says he will talk to European counterpart about Serbia case .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Searchers found two hands and two feet Wednesday near the famous ""Hollywood"" sign, the same area where police said a severed head was discovered earlier. A cadaver dog found part of a human hand Wednesday morning about 50 yards from where a severed head was discovered in a Hollywood Hills park on Tuesday, police said. Another hand was located later in the afternoon, and two feet were found Wednesday evening, Los Angeles Police Officer Cleon Joseph said. ""We're hoping that we can find more remains,"" Los Angeles Police Cmdr. Andrew Smith said. The head, found Tuesday by two people walking dogs along a dirt trail, is that of a man between 40 and 60 years old, with salt-and-pepper-colored hair, Los Angeles County Deputy Chief Coroner Ed Winter said Wednesday. Investigators ""have every reason to believe"" the hands and head belonged to the same person, Smith said. It is possible an animal may have dragged the body parts from where they were initially placed, Smith said. Investigators suspect they had been in the park for about two days. The body parts were found in brush off a secondary trail, about a half-mile from the park entrance, Smith said. At least 30 Los Angeles police officers, a dozen coroner's investigators, a SWAT team trained in climbing skills and mounted officers were searching a seven-acre section of Bronson Canyon, next to Griffith Park, Smith said. The search effort in the area's steep terrain was suspended late Wednesday afternoon because of failing light, but searchers will resume work after daylight Thursday, police said. Los Angeles police homicide investigators have begun checking recent missing-person reports for leads on the identity of the man whose head was found, Winter said. The two people who reported finding the head told park rangers they were walking about nine dogs in the Bronson Canyon area of the park around 2:30 p.m. Tuesday when two of the dogs started playing with an object in a plastic grocery bag, police told CNN. The rangers in turn notified robbery and homicide detectives, who are handling the investigation.

"(CNN) -- A piece of ice four times the size of Manhattan island has broken away from an ice shelf in Greenland, according to scientists in the U.S. The 260 square-kilometer (100 square miles) ice island separated from the Petermann Glacier in northern Greenland early on Thursday, researchers based at the University of Delaware said. The ice island, which is about half the height of the Empire State Building, is the biggest piece of ice to break away from the Arctic icecap since 1962 and amounts to a quarter of the Petermann 70-kilometer floating ice shelf, according to research leader Andreas Muenchow. ""The freshwater stored in this ice island could keep the Delaware or Hudson rivers flowing for more than two years. It could also keep all U.S. public tap water flowing for 120 days,"" Muenchow said. Muenchow's team is studying ice in the Nares Strait separating Greenland from Canada, about 1,000 kilometers south of the North Pole. Satellite data from NASA's MODIS-Aqua satellite revealed the initial rupture which was confirmed within hours by Trudy Wohlleben of the Canadian Ice Service, according to the University of Delaware website. Muenchow said the island could block the Nares Strait as it drifts south, or break into smaller islands and continue towards the open waters of the Atlantic. ""In Nares Strait, the ice island will encounter real islands that are all much smaller in size,"" he said. ""The newly born ice island may become land-fast, block the channel, or it may break into smaller pieces as it is propelled south by the prevailing ocean currents. From there, it will likely follow along the coasts of Baffin Island and Labrador, to reach the Atlantic within the next two years."" Environmentalists say ice melt is being caused by global warming with Arctic temperatures in the 1990s reaching their warmest level of any decade in at least 2,000 years, according to a study published in 2009. Current trends could see the Arctic Ocean become ice free in summer months within decades, researchers predict.","260 square-kilometer Ice island is biggest since 1962, researchers say .

"(CNN) -- Top executives of the company that owned the Deepwater Horizon oil rig announced Tuesday they will donate their safety bonuses to the families of the 11 workers killed in the April 2010 explosion in the Gulf of Mexico. The announcement follows criticism of a Transocean Ltd. financial filing that claimed 2010 was its ""best year"" in safety. ""The executive team made this decision because we believe it is the right thing to do,"" Chief Executive Officer Steven Newman said in a statement Tuesday. ""Nothing is more important to Transocean than our people, and it was never our intent to diminish the effect the Macondo tragedy has had on those who lost loved ones,"" he said. ""We offer our most sincere apologies and we regret the impact this matter has had on the entire Transocean family."" The five executives will donate more than $250,000 to the Deepwater Horizon Memorial Fund, which Transocean established. The fund has distributed more than $1.6 million to the 11 families. The executives were identified as Newman; Ricardo H. Rosa, senior vice president and chief financial officer; Arnaud A.Y. Bobillier, executive vice president, asset and performance; Eric Brown, executive vice president, legal & administration; and Ihab M. Toma, executive vice president, global business. Transocean Ltd., in a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, said hefty bonuses and raises to top executives were based in part on the company's ""performance under safety"" last year. ""Notwithstanding the tragic loss of life in the Gulf of Mexico, we achieved an exemplary statistical safety record as measured by our total recordable incident rate and total potential severity rate,"" the SEC statement reads. ""As measured by these standards, we recorded the best year in safety performance in our company's history."" Safety accounted for 25% of the performance measures that determined the 2010 bonus plan, the proxy form stated. Transocean tried to clear the water first with an apology Monday. ""We acknowledge that some of the wording in our 2010 proxy statement may have been insensitive in light of the incident that claimed the lives of eleven exceptional men last year and we deeply regret any pain that it may have caused,"" Transocean said in a statement to CNN. ""Nothing in the proxy was intended to minimize this tragedy or diminish the impact it has had on those who lost loved ones. Everyone at Transocean continues to mourn the loss of these friends and colleagues."" The April 20, 2010, explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig, which was leased to BP, injured 17 workers and killed 11 others, including nine Transocean employees, according to the SEC filing. It has been called the worst spill in U.S. history.

"(CNN) -- Neil Sobleski of Dayton, Ohio had been looking forward to it more than anything else. ""I was 4 years old in May of 1980 and already a certified 'Star Wars' maniac,"" he said. ""I had a slew of the toys, and they were my most prized possessions."" On the fateful day when he went to see ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" the second movie in the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy, Sobleski had little patience for the movie to start. ""I remember that my mom and I were going to see the movie with my aunt, and I found the wait to get to the theater at the local mall in St. Clairsville, Ohio, excruciating,"" he said. ""After what seemed like an eternity, we were finally seated at the theater, and the familiar 'Star Wars' title logo was blazing from the screen, larger than life, with the opening crawl going by as fast as I could read it. For the next two hours, I was riveted to the screen."" There is one moment everyone remembers from the ""The Empire Strikes Back"" more than anything else: The revelation that Darth Vader is, in fact, Luke's father. Then 9-year-old John Booth remembers the moment well. ""I heard from some kids that Darth Vader was Luke's father, and even though it was spoiled, it made me want to see it even more,"" he said. Still, that was nothing compared to hearing Vader himself say it in the movie. He vividly remembers the reaction he and his friends had at the time. ""We were just kind of frozen and just kind of gaped at each other."" For Booth, there were little moments that stood out as well, like seeing the back of Darth Vader's head. ""It really creeped me out and fascinated me when I was little."" It's moments like these that left a mark on so many ""Star Wars"" fans. Thirty years to the day after its release, iReporters and others are remembering what made ""Empire"" so special and how it's affected them to this day. iReport: Why ""Empire"" mattered . For Heidi Sweetwater, seeing the movie for the first time ""was extremely tense ... you've heard on the 'edge of your seat' expression. I was literally on the edge of my seat the whole time. I haven't had an experience like that since,"" she said. ""For people in my age bracket, that was the first time there were special effects like that."" Since then, Sweetwater has amassed quite the collection of ""Star Wars"" Pez dispensers. After a journey to Hoth, the first appearance of Yoda, seeing fan favorite Boba Fett in the flesh, Han Solo frozen in carbonite (which ""literally made me fall out of my seat in terror,"" according to Sobleski) and a cliffhanger ending, the credits rolled. After that, these fans would never be the same. ""This movie was opening my mind to the infinite potential that was possible in the universe and within me,"" Sobleski said. ""Yoda's admonition to 'do or do not' became my personal motto before I was old enough to know what a motto was, and a lifelong love of science and flight was born that continues to this day. I tell people all the time that if it wasn't for 'Star Wars,' and especially 'Empire,' I probably wouldn't be an aerospace engineer today."" iReport: ""Empire"" changed my life . Sobleski is far from the only person whose life took a new direction after seeing the movie. Consetta Parker actually married a ""stormtrooper."" ""When I saw 'Empire' for the first time, I cried (in the best possible way). I walked out of the theater transformed, and it was like I was seeing things differently for the first time,"" she said. Before she even returned home, 9-year-old Parker immediately began collecting merchandise from the movie and drawing her own posters with ""Star Wars"" themes. Soon after, she wished to meet a boy who loved ""Star Wars"" as much as she did. A year later, she got her first job, with her only motivation to buy more ""Star Wars"" toys. Many jobs later, she worked at a press junket for the final ""Star Wars"" movie, ""Revenge of the Sith,"" on Skywalker Ranch, and she met one of the many stormtroopers there made available for filmmaking. ""The first thing I said to him was 'Aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper?' "" Her wish from years before would soon come true. On May 4, 2008, they were married at the George Lucas Theater in San Rafael, California, with many other stormtroopers, ""R2-D2"" and ""Darth Vader"" in attendance. (Parker is actually one of two iReporters who had an elaborate ""Star Wars""-themed wedding.) iReport: I married a stormtrooper . The movie holds a special place in the heart of many hardcore fans like Parker. Comedian Paul Scheer counts himself among those fans. ""Puppets, robots, lightsabers, crater monsters, carbonite, the tauntaun sleeping bag and Boba Fett. How can you not love this movie?"" he said. "" 'Empire' is the one film that I have watched so many times that I actually wore out the videotape and broke it when I was a kid."" Scheer was one of many celebrity fans who attended a charity screening of the movie on Wednesday night. ""It holds up. Surprisingly, it also develops characters, mythology and keeps you invested in the relationships as well as the action,"" he said. ""Plus the effects look really good. Yoda, in puppet form, looks more real than 98 percent of CGI creatures you see in movies. It's crazy to think that the advancement of technology actually hindered the prequels."" iReporter Arturo Navarro refuses to even acknowledge the prequels: ""In my mind, they do not exist!"" He is one of the purists, or as he calls them, ""true 'Star Wars' fans"" who didn't even like the 1997 special editions released in theaters, saying they ruined the original trilogy. iReport: ""Empire"" was the best . Booth might not go quite that far, but he certainly remembers the ""Empire"" era fondly. He literally wrote the book on the subject: ""Collect All 21! Memoirs of a Star Wars Geek - The First 30 Years."" From ""the biggest one-two punch cliffhanger ending ever,"" to the endless amounts of merchandise available, memories always come flooding back when Booth thinks about ""Empire."" ""[Anything] from that time stirs nerves of excitement and anticipation. 'Empire' is the best in the 'Star Wars' bunch.""","30 years later, fans remember seeing ""Empire Strikes Back"" for the first time .

"(CNN) -- Peru and Yale University have reached an agreement that will return a massive collection of pre-Columbian Inca artifacts to the South American country -- a settlement that could end a lengthy dispute over relics excavated nearly a century ago. A high-level university representative pledged in a 90-minute meeting Friday to return the artifacts excavated from the ancient Inca ruins of Machu Picchu, Peruvian President Alan Garcia said. ""The Peruvian government is grateful for this decision and recognizes that Yale University conserved these parts and pieces that otherwise would have been dispersed in private collections throughout the world, and perhaps would have disappeared,"" Garcia said in a statement. Yale also expressed its satisfaction that the disagreement may be over. ""Yale is very pleased with the positive developments in the discussions about the return of Machu Picchu artifacts to Peru,"" the university said in a statement Saturday. ""It has always been Yale's desire to reach an agreement that honors Peru's rich history and cultural heritage and recognizes the world's interest in ongoing public and scholarly access to that heritage."" The controversy had taken on added heat recently, with Garcia asking U.S. President Barack Obama in June to help Peru regain custody of the artifacts. Thousands of Peruvians also demonstrated in several cities in June demanding the return of the collection. Hopes had remained high in Peru, with Foreign Minister Jose Garcia Belaunde telling CNN two weeks ago that an agreement was expected soon. The pieces would be returned at the beginning of 2011 -- in time for the country's celebration of the 100th anniversary of Machu Picchu's rediscovery, Garcia said. The artifacts were excavated from the site by historian Hiram Bingham in 1912 during the first of several expeditions he led to Peru. Bingham was an adjunct professor of Latin American history at Yale between 1907 and 1915. His collection of archaeological pieces, documents and photographs are housed at the university's Peabody Museum. After they are returned to Peru, the relics would be handed over to San Antonio Abad del Cusco University, where investigators will continue studying them, Garcia said. Peruvian officials have demanded their return for at least seven years and filed a civil lawsuit against the university in April 2009 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Garcia said he hashed out the deal Friday with former Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo, who directs the Yale Center for the Study of Globalization. There are between 4,000 to 40,000 pieces, depending on how they are catalogued, said Yale University spokesman Tom Conroy. But only about 350 are museum quality pieces, he told CNN. John Verano, an anthropologist from Tulane University, studied the skeletons in the Yale collection in 2000. Much of the Yale collection, he said, consists of shards and fragments, not complete objects that can easily be shown in a museum. ""The collection,"" he said, ""is one of the most valuable Inca collections there is. In terms of beauty, though, the collection there is pretty junky. It's not museum quality."" The controversy over who has rights to the collection stems from Bingham's expeditions. ""There's some difference of opinion whether Hiram Bingham had a legitimate permit to export,"" Verano said. Peruvian Foreign Minister Garcia Belaunde pointed out that a November 1916 letter from Bingham to the National Geographic Society, which funded the Peru expeditions, stated that the artifacts were on loan. ""Now they do not belong to us, but to the Peruvian government, who allowed us to take them out of the country on condition that they be returned in 18 months,"" Bingham wrote about skeletal remains to Gilbert H. Grosvenor of the National Geographic Society. ""The whole matter has assumed a very large importance in the eyes of the Peruvians, who feel that we are trying to rob their country of its treasures,"" Bingham wrote in the letter, which CNN obtained from the Peruvian government. But Yale's stewardship of the artifacts has often been lost in the argument, Verano noted. ""Unfortunately in issues of bureaucracy, the injured party -- in this case Peru -- gets swept up in nationalism and human rights,"" the anthropologist said. Machu Picchu, the 15thcentury Inca citadel where the relics were found, is a national treasure in Peru. The government declared the site a Peruvian Historical Sanctuary in 1981, and the ruins were designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983. That makes the relics even more significant to many Peruvians. ""Machu Picchu is Peru's premiere self-identity and tourism site,"" Verano said, pointing out that the ruin gets 1 million visitors annually and Peru earns $100 million in ticket and permit sales. On the flip side, there's the issue of Yale's investment. ""Yale spent a lot of infrastructure money conserving the objects and preserving them,"" Verano said. Yale could argue, he said, that Peru does not have the facilities to properly store the artifacts. ""It's true that the infrastructure quality in Peru is very poor,"" Verano said. ""There are objects rotting there."" Garcia, Peru's president, acknowledged those difficulties in his statement Friday. ""With all these goods in Peru,"" he said, ""we need a place where the Universidad San Antonio Abad can exhibit them and we will request a supplemental credit to parliament, a budget enabling of the millions required to enable a house, a building where these artifacts can be exhibited, where archaeologists from Cusco, Peru, Yale and around the world can continue its studies."" Yale also may have been reluctant to return the artifacts because it did not want to set a precedent. ""Once a museum returns something,"" Verano said, ""other countries would jump in and want something back."" Not to mention, he said, that ""every museum hates to give all their stuff away."" Verano, who has spent every summer for the past 26 years digging through the ruins of north and central Peru, understands each side's argument. ""I have sympathy for both sides,"" he said. ""In this case, there have been missteps and there should have been more diplomacy on both sides.""","A university representative pledges to return the ancient Incan pieces .

"Cairo (CNN) -- The Egyptian army and police are cracking down in an ""anti-terror"" operation in the Sinai area of Egypt, state-owned media reported on Tuesday, as reports emerge of Osama bin Laden's doctor surfacing in the area. Police said they found hand grenades, machine guns, rocket-propelled grenades and ammunition in the operation that targets Sinai ""terror cells"" suspected in attacks on a gas pipeline to Israel and a police station in the border town of el-Arish. One person was killed and 12 were arrested on Monday, the first day of the operation, said Hazem al-Maadawi, a police officer involved in the offensive. Citing an unnamed security official, state news agency EgyNews said authorities are targeting 15 more people who participated in attacks at an el-Arish police station -- some of whom are members of the extremist Jaish el-Islam group, which is affiliated with al Qaeda. The crackdown comes amid new developments on the whereabouts of a bin Laden associate. Ramzi Mahmoud Al Mowafi, the doctor of the late al Qaeda leader, escaped from a Cairo prison during the Egyptian revolution earlier this year and has resurfaced in the country's North Sinai area, an official said. ""Al Mowafi, also known among his fellow Jihadists as the 'chemist,' escaped from a maximum security prison in Cairo on January 30 while serving a life sentence,"" Maj. Yaser Atia from Egyptian General Security told CNN Monday. According to prison records, Al Mowafi was sentenced to life for a ""military case"" -- but more details were not immediately known. Bin Laden's longtime personal doctor and an explosives expert, Al Mowafi was born in Egypt in 1952. He left for Afghanistan to join al Qaeda, according to the data listed in his prison records. ""Al Mowafi was seen in Sinai by several Jihadist(s) according to witness testimonials,"" Gen. Sameh Seif Al Yezen said. ""I know he is very dangerous and that he had set up his own laboratory in Tora Bora with bin Laden. A full report will be published on this matter in the upcoming week."" A general in Egypt's intelligence service, who did not want to be identified because he is not authorized to speak with the media, told CNN that ""Al Mowafi surfaced in el-Arish and communicated with several 'terrorists' from the Egyptian Takfir wal-Hijra and the Palestinian Islamic Army."" Takfir wal-Hijra is a militant Islamist group. The general added, ""Al Qaeda is present in Sinai, mainly in the area of Sakaska close to Rafah."" For neighboring Israel, the lack of state authority in Sinai is becoming a source of anxiety. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a Knesset committee recently that Egypt was having difficulty exercising its sovereignty over Sinai. ""What's happening in Sinai is that global terrorist organizations are meddling there and their presence is increasing because of the connection between Sinai and Gaza,"" Netanyahu said. Since the beginning of the revolution, the gas pipeline running through el-Arish used to export gas to Israel has been bombed five times by unidentified men. Several police officers were kidnapped and killed in recent months, but no group has claimed responsibility for the attacks. On July 29, several dozen people were demonstrating outside the al Nasr mosque in el-Arish after Friday prayers. Mohamed Mahmoud, who was among the protesters, recalled what happened that day. ""The Takfiris stormed in by the hundreds mounted on pickup trucks and motorcycles waving black flags, a symbol of Jihad,"" he told CNN from a safe house not far from el-Arish. ""The militants were heavily armed with machine guns, hand grenades and rocked-propelled grenades."" The head of security in North Sinai, Gen. Saleh al Masry, told CNN that Takfir-wal-Higra had become active during the revolution that led to the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak. ""The terrorists were joined by members of Palestinian factions, and they are currently being questioned by military intelligence. We arrested 12 assailants, including three Palestinians,"" al Masry said. ""The investigation resulted in troubling information. Al Qaeda has been funding and recruiting cells in Sinai including members of the Takfir wal-Hijra joined by Palestinians from the Islamic Army,"" Atia said. Bedouin smugglers who control the majority of underground tunnels into Gaza were not happy to learn that Palestinians were among the attackers. Mohamed Younis, one of the tunnel operators, told CNN, ""I charge $50 to smuggle them in for trade purposes in coordination with Hamas on the other side. After the attack we have banned any Palestinians from coming through. We are trying to bring peace to the area and don't need trouble."" Gen. Abdel Wahab, the governor of North Sinai, confirmed that a flier titled ""Al Qaeda Sinai Branch"" circulated outside a mosque in el-Arish on Wednesday. The document called for an Islamic state in Sinai and announced that the group was planning attacks on the police stations and security forces last Friday. The Egyptian military presence in the demilitarized zone in Sinai under the Camp David Agreement signed in 1978 between Egypt and Israel raises many questions. ""Under the accords of the agreements, parties may increase forces in the restricted zones if there is national threat with the coordination among both parties. In this case Israel was informed and the forces will remain there for a time agreed upon by both countries, that may be also extended until the situation is dealt with,"" said Al Yezen, a military analyst. ""This operation serves the interest of Israel too and ensures the safety of its borders,"" he added. CNN's Amir Ahmed contributed to this report.","NEW: Israel's Netanyahu says terrorists are meddling in Sinai .

Curtis' attorney, Christi McCoy, said her client has been framed by someone who used several phrases Curtis likes to use on social media. The letters read, in part: ""To see a wrong and not expose it, is to become a silent partner to its continuance."" They were signed ""I am KC and I approve this message,"" a source told CNN. They each had a Memphis, Tennessee, postmark and no return address. McCoy said she was sure someone else was to blame. ""I do believe that someone who was familiar and is familiar with Kevin just simply took his personal information and did this to him,"" McCoy said. ""It is absolutely horrific that someone would do this."" Curtis said it was an eye-opener for him. ""I think now, how many people are thrown in jail because of circumstantial evidence and someone can frame you that easily,"" he said. Curtis had been accused of sending letters containing ""a suspicious granular substance"" to Obama; Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Mississippi; and Sadie Holland, a Justice Court judge in Lee County, Mississippi. The FBI said the substance tested positive for ricin, a toxin derived from castor beans that has no known antidote. No illnesses had been found as a result of exposure to the toxin.

"(CNN) -- Too few Americans are willing to talk about sexually transmitted infections, or STIs, but we simply cannot afford to avoid these discussions any longer. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently released data showing just how common and costly STIs are in the United States, especially for America's youth. Each year, we have 20 million new STI cases, half among teens and young adults ages 15 to 24. Across the nation at any given time, there are more than 110 million total infections, including new and existing infections. While the number of new infections is roughly equal among young women and young men, the health consequences of untreated STIs can be much more serious for young women, including losing the ability to have children. Every year, about 24,000 women in the United States become infertile because of an STI they probably didn't even know they had, because most infections have no symptoms. Left untreated, common STIs such as chlamydia and gonorrhea can also cause chronic pelvic pain, ectopic pregnancy and increase HIV risk. Human papillomavirus, or HPV, is by far the most common STI, representing nearly three-quarters of all STI cases. While the vast majority of HPV infections will not cause serious harm, some infections will persist and can lead to cervical cancer. Beyond the impact on an individual's health, STIs are also a significant drain on the U.S. health care system. Recent data place the cost of treating STIs at nearly $16 billion annually. Infections among young people account for nearly half of that cost (approximately $7.8 billion ). Young people are most at risk for several reasons. They are more likely to have multiple sex partners. Young women are biologically more susceptible to STIs, and many young people may be reluctant to disclose their risk behavior to a doctor, because of embarrassment, stigma or concerns about confidentiality. The good news is that all STIs are preventable and most are curable. But, because most STIs have no symptoms, testing is the necessary first step to treatment. CDC recommends annual chlamydia screening for sexually active women 25 years old and under. Annual gonorrhea screening is also recommended for sexually active women with new or multiple sex partners and women who live in communities with a high burden of the disease. Sexually active gay and bisexual men should be tested at least annually for HIV, syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea. All Americans should be screened at least once for HIV. In addition, for those who have not previously received the HPV vaccination, CDC recommends vaccination for all teen girls and young women through age 26, as well as teen boys and young men through age 21. To increase the early diagnosis and treatment of STIs, CDC is reaching out to health care providers and young people at risk throughout the nation with messages about the importance of screening. But many more voices will be required to stop the silent, continuing toll of STIs. In our communities, we must speak out against the shame and stigma that has too long been associated with STIs. Parents and caregivers need to open the door for frank, honest discussions with their children about STIs and behaviors that can place them at risk. And physicians need to talk to their young patients about STIs, risk behaviors and effective prevention methods. Sexually active Americans should talk with their doctor about STIs and which tests may be right for them. A little knowledge about STIs and regular screening can go a long way. It's also important for those who are sexually active to talk openly and honestly with partners about STIs, and to use condoms consistently and correctly. The severe health and economic toll of STIs in America is entirely preventable. With increased awareness, prevention, testing and treatment we can bring this hidden epidemic into the spotlight and safeguard the health of young people while saving the nation billions of dollars in the process. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gail Bolan.","Gail Bolan: Each year, we have 20 million new STIs cases, half of them among young people .

"(CNN) -- Enrique Peña Nieto, the man election authorities project will be Mexico's next president, was the governor of Mexico's most populous state. His wife is a well-known television star. Since 1984, the 45-year-old lawyer has been building his political career. He has been a state official, a local lawmaker and a political adviser to the Institutional Revolutionary Party . Peña Nieto projected winner in Mexican presidential vote . His five-year tenure as the governor of the state of Mexico, which surrounds the capital and has more than 15 million residents, catapulted him into the national spotlight. Some analysts said being governor from 2005 to 2011 also garnered him greater attention not only within the ranks of his party but within the national media. But not all the attention has been positive. At times, Peña Nieto's personal life has been tabloid fodder. He has admitted fathering two kids out of wedlock while married to his first wife, Monica Pretelini Saenz, who died in 2007 after suffering a seizure. In 2010, he married the prominent actress Angelica Rivera, best known for her role as the domineering tequila maker in the soap opera ""Destilando Amor,"" Spanish for ""Distilling Love."" At a recent campaign event his convoy was pelted with rocks by students who feel Peña Nieto had been given a free pass by the media. Weeks before Sunday's vote, criticisms of Peña Nieto and concerns about the PRI's possible return to power fueled a student movement that staged demonstrations throughout the country. Peña Nieto's campaign has been based on a series of pledges that he said will increase the quality of life for Mexicans nationwide. Future of U.S.-Mexico relationship . His platform included plans to stop the rise in food prices, promote energy reform, give social security to all Mexicans and reduce violence nationwide. ""I propose changing fear for hope. I propose changing Mexico,"" he said in a presidential debate this year. While his proposals for reducing violence have played well in Mexico, they sparked some concerned among Republican lawmakers on the other side of the border, who worry he may not be as committed to combating cartels as his predecessor. Peña Nieto's campaign has said he remains committed to fighting organized crime.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Chinese table tennis player Zhuang Zedong, a key figure in what became known as the ""ping pong diplomacy"" that helped thaw frosty Cold War relations between the United States and China, has died aged 73, state-run news agency Xinhua reported. Zhuang's chance meeting with a U.S. player was instrumental in Beijing's decision to invite the American table tennis team for an exhibition match in 1971. That match laid the groundwork for the visit of U.S. President Richard Nixon in 1972 and ultimately paved the way for the establishment of diplomatic ties in 1979, ending China's isolation from the outside world. Xinhua said that Zhuang, who was considered one of the best players in the world in the 1960s, had met U.S. table tennis player Glenn Cowan at a tournament in Japan. Cowan, a long-haired teenager, had jumped on the Chinese team's bus after missing his own and Zhuang struck up a conversation through a translator -- a brave act given the constraints of China's Cultural Revolution-era politics. ""We were all tense,"" Zhuang told CNN in 2008. ""Our team had been advised not to speak to Americans, not to shake their hands, and not to exchange gifts with them. ""I looked at him, thinking, 'he is not the one who makes national policies, he is just an athlete, an ordinary American',"" he recalled. Zhuang gave the hippie-looking American a silk brocade as a gift. The next day, Cowan gave him a T-shirt emblazoned with a peace sign and the words ""LET IT BE."" Pictures of their encounter spread around the world, and, under the orders of Chinese leader Mao Zedong, the U.S. team was invited to visit China. During their visit, the U.S. announced the end of a 20-year trade embargo against the People's Republic. Their journey turned out to be the first public move in a rapprochement between the two bitter enemies. Zhuang said he never thought his simple gesture of friendship would coin the phrase ""ping-pong diplomacy."" ""I had no idea what was going on,"" he said. ""I didn't know what Chairman Mao was thinking. I was merely a ping-pong player."" Zhuang won three world championships and was a hero in table-tennis mad China. An innovative ""pen-hold"" style propelled him to the top of his sport. He became China's sports minister but fell victim to the power struggles that followed Mao's death in 1976 and was detained for four years before being exiled to the provinces. Zhuang later returned to Beijing, where he coached table tennis to teenagers. According to Xinhua, Zhuang had been suffering from colon cancer since 2008 and died in a Beijing hospital on Sunday after developing liver and lung complications.

"(CNN) -- Thousands have died in the current Ebola outbreak in West Africa, and much of the global conversation has centered on the lack of an approved medication to treat the deadly disease. Yet in 2013, 1.5 million people died from another infectious disease that has a cure. On Wednesday, the World Health Organization released its 2014 Global Tuberculosis Report, which shows that 9 million people developed tuberculosis in 2013 and 1.5 million died, making it one of the world's deadliest communicable diseases. ""In addition, around 3 million people who fall ill from TB are still being 'missed' by health systems each year either because they are not diagnosed, or because they are diagnosed but not reported,"" the WHO said in a statement. Tuberculosis, commonly called TB, is a bacterial infection that can be spread through the air. The bacteria usually attack patients' lungs but can also hit the kidney, spine and brain. Tuberculosis can be fatal, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but it doesn't have to be. Four drug regimens are approved to treat TB; the bacteria can usually be conquered by taking a mix of medications for six to nine months. More than 700 infants exposed to TB in Texas . The prevalence rate of TB has fallen 41% since 1990. But given the fact ""that most deaths from TB are preventable, the death toll from the disease is still unacceptably high and efforts to combat it must be accelerated,"" the WHO report authors write. Part of the reason so many are dying from tuberculosis is that a strain of the bacteria has become resistant to treatment. About 3.5% of the people who were diagnosed with TB in 2013 had this form of the disease, according to the WHO. But that's only 3.5%. Another reason is lack of funding, the WHO says. About $8 billion is needed each year for a ""full response,"" the agency says, but just over $6 billion is allocated. This money shortage plays into what is probably the top reason many people with tuberculosis are not being treated: The majority of cases are found in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific. Another quarter are found in Africa, which has the highest prevalence and death rate. Many people in these regions simply don't have access to quality health care. ""Pharmaceutical industries are less interested in diseases in developing countries where potential gains are limited,"" said Dr. Mario Raviglione, director of WHO's Global Tuberculosis Programme. ""As a result, we have a problem (with tuberculosis) because people know that 95% of cases are in developing countries."" There are 15 tuberculosis vaccines being tested in clinical trials around the world, according to the WHO report. An effective vaccine could be a way to stop the epidemic for good.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- The new school year in China began Monday with a horrifying attack. A man stabbed to death three children at a primary school in central China and then committed suicide by jumping off a building, state media reported. The attacker, identified by his surname Chen, broke into Dongfang Primary School in Hubei province around 10:20 a.m., Xinhua news agency said, citing the local government. Wielding a knife, the man stabbed eight students and a teacher before he took his own life, the report said. Three of the students died, and the six other victims have been hospitalized, Xinhua reported. Two of the students are seriously hurt, it said. An initial investigation suggested that the attacker bore a grudge that his daughter was not allowed to attend the school after failing to complete a summer homework assignment, according to Xinhua. Monday was the first day back at school after the summer vacation for most students in China. The report said police are investigating the case. The attack happened in Yunxi county, in the administrative region of Shiyan city. A member of staff at the local education authority who answered a call from CNN said the only information available was in Xinhua's report. Police in Shiyan didn't answer repeated phone calls. Xinhua said it wasn't immediately clear how the man got into the school campus. China suffered a spate of knife and cleaver attacks targeting school children in 2010. A number of measures were introduced at the time, including increased security at schools across the country and a regulation requiring people to register with their national ID cards when buying large knives. CNN's Serena Dong contributed to this report.","A man stabs 8 children and a teacher at a primary school in Hubei province .

"Boston (CNN) -- In many respects it was like a meeting of old friends: James ""Whitey"" Bulger listening carefully -- laughing heartily at one point -- to colorful recollections of former Boston bookie Richard O'Brien, who ran a successful bookmaking operation that he inherited from his father. But this was no remember-when reunion between two elderly men. The 84-year-old O'Brien, who lives in Florida and uses a wheel chair, testified Friday as a prosecution witness at the federal trial of Bulger, who is charged in the deaths of 19 people during the nearly two decades that prosecutors say he was the head of the Irish mob in Boston. O'Brien described a meeting between Bulger and a man who owed him money. When the man balked at paying, Bulger replied, ""We have a business besides bookmaking."" ""What's that?"" the man asked. ""Killing (expletive) like you."" The 83-year-old Bulger, who has shown little emotion in the first days of trial, threw his head back and let out a laugh. At trial, Bulger edscribed as 'hands-on killer' O'Brien said he was an ""independent"" bookmaker, or unaffiliated with a crime organization, when Bulger summoned him to a meeting to discuss joining the Bulger group. O'Brien said had been working for the Italian mafia in Boston's North End but Bulger told him, ""Forget the North End. If you want to be in business, you have to be with us."" He had no choice but to join Bulger's Winter Hill gang, O'Brien testified, saying, ""Their reputation preceded them."" O'Brien then referenced Boston's violent gang wars saying, ""A lot of people were shot. Mr. Bulger ended up on top. You can draw your own conclusions."" Thus began a 14-year relationship, with O'Brien testifying he paid Bulger's group a couple of thousand dollars, cash, in ""rent"" virtually every month. Asked why, O'Brien replied, ""I valued my life as well as those with me."" The monthly payment went in excess of $2,000, O'Brien said, and was sometimes higher because Bulger and partner Steven ""The Rifleman"" Flemmi would charge random ""taxes"" if, for example, one of O'Brien's workers found himself at the end of a government wiretap. Bulger never personally took the money, which was always paid in cash. It was always handed to Bulger's partner, Flemmi. ""Maybe he never wanted it entered into evidence,"" O'Brien offered. O'Brien said he moved to Florida in the early '90s, turning over the day-to-day operations of his bookmaking business to one of his six daughters. Several years later, he said, he was summoned to a meeting with Flemmi amid rumblings that Bulger associates -- including a ""father-and-daughter team"" -- were starting to cooperate with the government. He said before he left for the meeting he told his daughter, ""If I'm not back in 12 hours go to the FBI in Miami. Don't go home (to Boston). Don't go to the FBI there."" O'Brien is expected to continue testifying Monday. Jurors earlier heard testimony from retired Massachusetts State Police Col. Thomas Foley, who on Thursday described the FBI's informant program as ""poorly run."" ""The FBI put a higher priority protecting their informants"" than they did protecting ""public safety,"" Foley said. Bulger's lawyers are trying to show Bulger was allowed to act with impunity, sanctioned by corrupt FBI agents and federal prosecutors. On cross-examination Bulger attorney Hank Brennan questioned Foley about the integrity of Bulger's FBI informant file, which is likely to be introduced at trial, asking the retired investigator why he would accept the informant file as accurate when it was compiled by the same FBI agents Foley believed were lying to him. Foley said he had other sources but acknowledged he had never checked the validity of the entire file. Bulger's lawyers also are trying to establish that Bulger was never a paid informant for the FBI and that instead Bulger was the one paying rogue agents for information. The trial is expected to take up to three months and has the potential to reveal sensational details about the mob and FBI corruption, especially if Bulger chooses to testify. Bulger was in hiding for 16 years before he was captured in Santa Monica, California, two years ago, living under a false name with his girlfriend in an apartment in the oceanside city. At his July 2011 arraignment, he pleaded not guilty to the 19 murder charges and 13 other counts.","""Whitey"" Bulger was captured in 2011 after 16 years in hiding .

"(CNN) -- One of Australia's largest supermarket chains has come under fire for an online job ad that specified that ""no Indians or Asians"" should apply. The ad, which sought cleaners at a Coles supermarket near the Tasmanian capital of Hobart, sparked condemnation after it was posted Sunday, according to Australian media reports. Coles said the offending ad was placed by a cleaning subcontractor without the company's knowledge, in a written statement from spokesperson Jim Cooper. ""Coles is a proud, equal-opportunity employer and at no time have we ever issued the directives contained in this ad."" The company said it was ""extremely concerned to learn of the ad and its contents"" and has terminated the subcontractor's services as a result. It said it will also retrain its cleaning contractor on equal opportunity employment policies. The ad has since been removed from the popular Gumtree classifieds website. ""I'm certainly going to look at commencing an investigation into what's happeningâ€”the role of Gumtree, what Coles' role was, and find out more details about the subcontractor,"" said Tasmania's Anti-Discrimination Commissioner Robin Banks. She said the ad was clearly ""discriminatory on the basis of race"" and a breach of the Tasmania Anti-Discrimination Act. Banks said she would examine whether Coles ""fulfilled its obligations to ensure its agents do not engage in discrimination,"" while Gumtree may have breached the Act by permitting the publication of discriminatory advertising, she added. Banks said that while she has encountered discriminatory job ads in newspapers and other websites, this was the first case she has seen involving Gumtree. ""It happens every so often,"" she said, adding that in her experience, newspaper editors have been ""very responsive"" in improving procedures to vet ads and setting up training for their staff. In addition to media reports, Banks was alerted to the Coles ad through a post to her personal Facebook page. This showed that the community cares about fighting discrimination, she said. ""One of the things we're trying to encourage in Australia, especially in Tasmania, is for people to do something about it (discrimination), to report it."" India and China are among the most common countries of birth of non-native Australians.

"(CNN) -- When a client asked Marcia Harris to furnish his daughter's 500-square foot, one-bedroom apartment in New York, the interior designer met her match. She struggled to find furniture scaled for a small space that served multiple purposes. Most sofas were too large to fit through the front door, let alone inhabit a hybrid living room-kitchenette. Tables, beds and ottomans lacked the storage space needed by a college student with a lot of clothing, handbags and shoes. So Harris took matters into her own hands, designing banquettes that held pots and pans and turned into beds, a storage ottoman that doubled as a seat and coffee table and modular bedroom storage units that fit through the front door. Working with craftsmen in Fairfield County, Connecticut -- striking distance from Harris' home office in Silvermine -- she came up with a stylish collection of upholstered furniture and hardwood storage units in less than three months. After the apartment was finished, she began hearing from others who wanted the same small, multipurpose pieces. ""At that point, I said to my husband, 'I think there's a real opportunity and need here,'"" said Harris, who has been working in interior design in New York and Connecticut for more than 30 years. It might sound counterintuitive considering the decline of American manufacturing in the post-industrial age, especially in the furniture industry. Products that are especially labor-intensive, such as hardwood and metal furniture, were the first to go overseas. Nowadays, most household furniture sold in the United States is imported, according to the American Home Furnishings Alliance, with the exception of upholstered furniture, because most of it is custom-ordered. Still, consumer spending on household furnishings continues to post modest year-to-year increases, according to the latest figures from the U.S. Department of Commerce. After all, the life events that trigger furniture purchases persist, such as births, children growing up and moves to new homes, said Pat Bowling, vice president of corporate communications for the American Home Furnishings Alliance. Small companies have found they can compete if they produce specialty or high-quality items that sell for a premium, according to Hoovers, part of the company Dun & Bradstreet, which provides business and industry insights. Harris was confident she had found a ripe niche market and spent the next two years developing prototypes. In 2012, she and her husband launched the Itsy Bitsy Ritzy Shop, a line of multipurpose modular furniture for small spaces. The business represented a reunion for the couple, who ran an advertising agency together in the 1980s and 1990s. They shuttered the business in the online boom, and Marcia Harris pursued interior design while Dean Harris went into online marketing. As her small space prototypes took shape, she decided to draw upon her husband's expertise in marketing, brand positioning and business development. Their son, Zach Harris, joined a few months later to handle digital operations, sales and business development. The Itsy Bitsy Ritzy Shop pieces are undeniably an investment -- dressers start at $1,300 and sofa beds start at $2,100. But that's the point, said Harris, to create high-quality pieces made by skilled tradespeople that can be passed down. The Itsy Bitsy Ritzy Shop relies on a small network of manufacturing partners within driving distance of the Harris' home in Silver Mine. Marcia Harris found them during her years working as an interior designer. Having a close manufacturing network allows the Itsy Bitsy Ritzy Shop to keep its carbon footprint low and lets Harris regularly visit to keep on top of projects. ""I have very high standards and they all share my dedication to quality craftsmanship,"" she said. ""They're great at what they do, but they're also reliable; they deliver when they say they're going to deliver, and they do a great job."" Harris pays regular visits to the Branford, Connecticut, upholstery manufacturing plant of Cerrito Furniture, which makes sofa and sleeper beds. Owner Ronald Cerrito, whose father started the company in 1943, says high-end clients like the Itsy Bitsy Ritzy Shop help keep his business alive. Because of offshoring and global competition, he acknowledges they're past the days when several trucks left loaded with products every day. ""No matter how cheap we are, we're not cheap enough,"" he said in a phone interview. ""We've maintained our quality level and that's working out for us; that's the only reason we're still here, because some people still want quality products. We're holding our own and we're going to stay that way."" Harris also visits Lee Bahamonde several times a month in her workshop on the main drag of the coastal town of Westport, Connecticut. There, Bahamonde and her son, Ed, work with a small team to construct upholstered banquettes and ottomans. A few miles up I-95, William Cruvinel and his family build hardwood dressers and storage units in a workshop in the old Singer Sewing factory in Bridgeport, Connecticut. In the year since launching, the Itsy Bitsy Ritzy Shop has shifted its focus toward commercial work for hotels and planned communities, in the interest of maximizing operating margins. The company also entered into a deal with a luxury apartment development in New York to furnish model apartments, allowing it to offer its furniture for sale to tenants as an in-house design concierge service. As a new business, the company is still finding its footing and enjoying each moment, Harris said. ""I'm doing what I love and I'm doing it with my family and other families who share our passion,"" she said. ""Even on bad days, you know you're working toward something positive. How is that a bad thing?""","Itsy Bitsy Ritzy Shop designs custom furniture for small spaces .

"Ottawa, Canada (CNN) -- It was a surprise, even for a journalist, to be driving down Wellington Street, the city's ceremonial thoroughfare, and to find myself swept into the chaotic aftermath of a disaster. I was rushing to a television studio at mid-morning and passing by the National War Memorial, just minutes after the shooting. A solider was down. Police were closing streets, stopping traffic, barking orders, brandishing machine guns, fingers on triggers. They soon imposed a lockdown, lasting until mid-afternoon. It is from that confinement that I began writing this. This is not supposed to happen in Canada -- much less Ottawa, its sleepy, self-absorbed capital. Sentries do not die on duty at the National War Memorial in this, our season of remembrance. Politicians do not cower in the committee rooms of Parliament, as its Gothic hallways ring with gunfire. Sharpshooters do not take up position on oxidized copper rooftops nearby, looking for men with long rifles. This is Canada, once known as ""the Peaceable Kingdom."" Now we have learned, like so many other countries, that terrible, unsentimental reality of the 21st century: It can happen here. When a gunman killed that lone soldier in front of the memorial today, when he -- and possibly his accomplices (at this moment we do not know whether, who or how many) -- then swept through the front doors of the Parliament of Canada and began firing, something changed here. When hundreds of parliamentarians, gathering in their weekly party caucuses, pushed leather chairs and tables against the doors and barricaded themselves inside their rooms and offices, something changed here. And when the city center was locked down and a perimeter thrown up around the parliamentary precinct and beyond, confining thousands to their offices and shops, something changed here. It is too much a cliché to say -- as many surely will -- that Canada has lost its innocence today. Canada is surely not innocent; a nation that marched into the maw of two world wars and left 100,000 of its sons in Europe understands a few things. That's particularly true at this time of year, when Canadians wear red poppies in their lapels until November 11, Remembrance Day. What we might say, though, is that Canada has lost its ignorance today -- and, perhaps, a good part of its complacency, too. This country is now chillingly aware that bad things can happen here, even in the seat of its democracy. Many of us blithely thought it could not, or would not, happen. In 147 years as a democracy, we have never had a revolution, a civil war or a foreign invasion. Abroad, we have not fought wars of conquest, we never had colonies, and we never fought alone. For years, we were the world's leading peacekeepers, projecting the sense of compromise abroad that we practice at home. Ours is an open, diverse society that has one of the highest levels of immigration in the world. It may be we thought ourselves impervious to pathologies and prejudices from home or abroad. Not here. Not us. Then again, why should Canada be immune? Canadians fought in Afghanistan. We are a member of NATO and an historic ally of the United States. Earlier this month our Parliament voted to join the air campaign against the Islamic State in Iraq. This week or next, our warplanes will go into action there. We should not be surprised. There have been ominous signs. A plot was foiled a few years ago to bomb Parliament and behead the Prime Minister. More recently, there have been increasing reports of ""radicalized"" Canadian Muslims joining jihadists in the Middle East. If what happened here is, in fact, an organized terror attack -- and even if it is something less, based simply on religious or ideological fervor -- it is another reminder of the dangers that have always come with a successful if complex society that aspires to a place in the world. Unlike the United States, Canada has little violent crime. It is among the safest of industrialized countries. Murders, even mass slayings, can and do happen in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver, its three largest cities. But they're unusual. Ottawa, Canada's fourth-largest city, is a government town. It is Canberra in Australia or Sacramento, California. It is not London, Paris or Rome. It's a parochial place whose mayor thinks that replacing a crumbling public library or building light rail -- years after other cities in Canada have done both -- is a bold idea. So, it is jarring, alarming and sad that this has happened here, of all places. But it was naïve to think that a country of 35 million people, on the way to war in Iraq, would not face this kind of violence one day. Now we have. Our long, sweet season of ignorance is over.","Andrew Cohen was swept into chaotic aftermath of Ottawa soldier shot, was in lockdown .

"(CNN) -- The case of Darren Deon Vann, who police say confessed to murdering as many as seven women in northwest Indiana over the past couple of years, is just the latest example of a kind of crime spree that has become all too familiar. At a time when television crime dramas like ""CSI,"" ""Criminal Minds,"" and ""Law and Order"" record high ratings with lurid plot lines about repeat killers, it is easy to come away believing that serial killings are as prevalent as they have ever been. Actually, quite the opposite is true. Looking at the actual numbers, it is clear that serial murder peaked during the 1970s and 1980s, and has declined dramatically ever since. During the 1980s, for example, there were an estimated 200 serial killers operating in the United States; in the first decade of this century, by contrast, the count was half that figure. Why? The reasons for this precipitous decline are complex. In part, the drop parallels the sharp downturn in all forms of homicide beginning during the 1990s, and is, to some extent, a result of some of the same factors. The growth in the U.S. prison population, for example, kept many violent predators -- including many potential serial killers -- safely behind bars. In 1980, for example, the number of prisoners under the jurisdiction of state or federal authorities stood at 330,000. By 1990 that number had climbed to 773,000, and by 2009 it had soared to 1.6 million. But the decline in serial murder may also reflect improved law enforcement investigative techniques. True, things might not always work quite as smoothly as they do on the crime drama ""Bones,"" but advances in DNA profiling and databases, as well as enhanced interagency communication, may have helped capture many would-be serial killers before they were able to amass a large victim count. In addition, a host of technological innovations -- including Amber Alert, sex offender registries, video surveillance systems, GPS tracking of mobile phones and vehicles, and monitoring of social media and chat rooms -- have presented law enforcement with additional tools to identify and apprehend sexual predators early in their criminal careers. Meanwhile, the Internet has provided sex offenders with a wide variety of options for satiating their sadistic desires without needing to involve unwilling victims. Of course, society may frown on the level of violence in widely available pornography. But as distasteful as it may sound, this ready accessibility may also serve as a cathartic release valve for certain individuals who might otherwise resort to rape, torture and murder (although the evidence on whether it is a release valve or sometimes a catalyst is mixed). Technology has also provided greater safety for potential victims. Cell phones and their photographic functions have added some level of protection from strangers. At the same time, the greater public awareness of serial offenders has significantly increased the level of caution about accepting rides or gifts from total strangers. Many parents, for example, have become reluctant to permit their unsupervised children to play in the street or the front yard of their own home. Decades ago, hitchhiking was a relatively common way of getting around. Nowadays, most people avoid hitching a ride unless there is absolutely no alternative. When was the last time you actually saw someone thumbing on the side of the road? Unfortunately, a reduction in known cases of serial murder is not the end of the story. It is possible, for instance, that a number of cases occurring in recent years have not yet been identified and solved, causing them to be absent from the database of known perpetrators. Even now, as in previous decades, so-called ""linkage blindness"" continues to prevent or at least delay recognition that a single killer may be responsible for widespread carnage. Before identifying a serial killer, we must first acknowledge the strong possibility that one is operating in a particular community. Over the decades, many serial killers have cleverly concealed the extent of their murderous behavior by varying their modus operandi, as well as the types of victim they target. Forty years ago, when many Americans were first apprised of accounts of serial murder, the fascination with the phenomenon -- and with names like Jeffrey Dahmer and Ted Bundy -- was palpable. As a result, enterprising entrepreneurs marketed serial killer ""murderabilia,"" including calendars, trading cards, T-shirts, action figures, paintings and comic books. As the public's fascination with serial killers has subsided, so has its preoccupation with more typical cases that do not yield double-digit body counts or particularly gruesome tortures. To attract extensive publicity, a serial killer almost has to stay on the loose for decades, kill a dozen victims or more, and engage in disturbing rituals or cannibalism. Fortunately, such characteristics are even rarer than the fans they inspire. Yet regardless of the decline in numbers, any serial murder remains a difficult and perplexing problem for law enforcement. There are still as many as 10 serial killers captured each year by the police, and even a drop in the numbers is unlikely to reduce the level of fear that serial killers still create. Indeed, the power they have over the public's psyche remains extraordinary, and criminologists have a responsibility to try to understand how and why these offenders take the lives of innocent victims -- and how they can do so with such chillingly cool deliberation.

"(CNN) -- If you think drag racing is extreme, you should try doing it uphill and on sand. Dune bashing is an action-packed motorsport popular in the Gulf, enjoyed by both local Emiratis and foreign tourists alike. It is not for the fainthearted and accidents are not uncommon. It is a sport that enthusiasts say requires not only speed and power, but also nerves of steel. Perhaps nothing tests all of these better than the Liwa International Festival, which ended last month, where 100 dune-bashing competitors battled it out to be the fastest up the tallest sand hill in the UAE. The 30-meter-high ""Scary Hill"" (Tel Moreeb in Arabic) earns its name thanks to the dizzyingly 50-degree steep slope. The government-funded festival is claimed to be a celebration of the desert landscape and the Bedouin culture. One competitor who shrugged off the fear factor at the recent event was Ahmed Al-Mashgouni of Team Sandtoyz. ""For me, it's normal because I'm Bedouin,"" he said. ""This is not scaring me."" The annual event also features a classic car show, as well as traditional sports such as falcon, camel and horse racing. But this year it was the dune-racing challenges that attracted most attention, with spectators and participants coming from across the region. Read more: Bollywood dreams of Dubai's migrant workers . Al-Mashgouni had an American mechanic to tune his buggies. His roaring, six-cylinder vehicles, with modified, turbo-charged engines, were the fruit of his travels around the region -- Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait -- that brought back homemade, sometimes crudely built, bikes and buggies. ""We are using a two-speed transmission,"" said Al-Mashgouni, winner of his class in the latest tournament. ""The normal one is one speed. It's especially built for us."" In contrast, Jasem Al-Ali of Team Victory learned how to build his vehicle from online videos. ""It was a 200-horsepower engine. Now it's 1,100 horsepower,"" he said. Sand dune racing is not a cheap hobby. The cars are built mostly with foreign parts. And even in this oil-rich region, the fuel needs to be imported from America. Salem Al-Dahmani's modified truck cost him $100,000 -- about ten times the modest prize the race awarded. But passion not money is motivation for the competitors. ""If you go to Japan, people are crazy for drifting,"" said Al-Dahmani of Team Champions. ""If you go to the U.S., people are crazy about drag racing. Here, we're crazy about this sport.""

"Kigali, Rwanda (CNN) -- The small group of young men walk confidently into the gymnasium in the Rwandan capital of Kigali, sit down and casually unfasten their legs. Each prosthetic limb is of differing sizes and shapes. Some are adorned with Nike trainers, others Puma. Each is left abandoned by the wheelchairs that circle the small volleyball court drawn out on to the hard concrete surface as their owners take to the floor and artfully glide into position. It has been a tough month for the Rwandan sitting volleyball team. Every day has seen double practice sessions. They have the biggest matches of their lives to prepare for: a Sub-Saharan qualification tournament against the likes of Kenya and the Democratic Republic of Congo. It is due to take place on home soil, in Kigali, and the Rwandans are the favorites. But it's not local bragging rights at stake. The winner secures a place at the 2012 London Paralympics. Rwanda is a country that is still synonymous with the 1994 genocide that saw the slaughter of close to a million people in eight months during a civil war between the dominant Hutus against the minority Tutsis. Follow CNN's Paralympics live blog . Today the country is still in the process of rebuilding from that brutal, almost unimaginable horror. But there is one sign of the genocide that cannot be erased so easily. The hundreds of thousands of amputees left maimed, but who survived the violence, who move silently through the crowded markets and streets like apologetic ghosts; unseen and unheard. No one talks of the genocide any more. But the amputees remain a record of the country's horrific past. It is a situation that the young men sitting on the floor practicing sitting volleyball are only too aware of. ""I started in 2009 and saw the game and I wasn't comfortable with it, but after a year I saw it was a good game for people with disabilities,"" said 25-year-old university student Emile Vuningoma, who plays as an attacker in the team, as he took a break from training in the dark hall. Join the Paralympics conversation #cnnparalympics . Vuningoma was born with his disability, but his parents didn't have the money to pay for the medical treatment that might have allowed him to use his leg. Playing for the team has given him a sense of purpose that many disabled people in Rwanda have yet to find. ""To be at London is very important for people with disabilities in Rwanda because we have to be there to present our country to the people with disabilities and those without disabilities,"" he said. ""There are some people in Rwanda who have the injuries from the 1994 genocide and do not have the capabilities to be part of society. They think about the past. There are so many with disabilities from the 1994 genocide. We are working hard to go to all the provinces and ask them to come back."" Laying ghosts to rest . One player who was directly affected by the genocide was the team's captain Dominique Bizimana, who is also the head of the Rwandan Paralympic Committee. ""There was the genocide and we were young, there was mines and by bad chance I lost my leg when I was 16,"" he explained. ""I was a volleyball player before I lost my leg. But when I lost my leg I said, 'No, I cannot give up. I have to fight to play sports.' And I started to play sitting volleyball in 2004. We are lucky because sports is one of the only ways to integrate people with disabilities (into society). We use sports as one way to do this."" Sport has also offered Bizimana the chance to lay to rest some of his own ghosts. During the genocide he was a 16-year-old conscript in a Tutsi militia. Playing next to him at the London 2012 Paralympic Games is 48-year-old Jean Rukondo, who fought against him in the Hutu-dominated army. Both lost a leg in the fighting but are now on the same team and best of friends. Training begins. The players move quickly across the floor at breakneck speed, careful to keep part of their backside and thigh on the floor at the same time (the main rule in sitting volleyball). Standing over them is Peter Karreman, the team's Dutch coach who masterminded Rwanda's qualification to the world championships last year. They lost every game, some heavily, but the experience ahead of the the Sub-Saharan qualification tournament was invaluable. ""About eight years ago I was training regular volleyball and by coincidence I saw sitting volleyball and it got me, it hit me in my heart. I became the head coach of Dutch team. Then the Rwanda team asked me,"" he said outside the hall. Many challenges . Unlike some disability sports, sitting volleyball is so tough to master, and so fast, that the technique of some of the top players is better than those in the able-bodied game. ""The rules are the same, but the term sitting is not good. They are moving on the ground, moving moving,"" explained Karreman. ""The rest of the game is the same. But it is fast, the field is smaller. So it's very attractive. It's good to play for the regular players because they learn how to play fast as well. It's good for their technique."" But preparing the team for the Paralympics has been Karreman's hardest job yet. The facilities are austere. In the corner stands a heap of twisted wheelchairs. The showers have long run dry. And the floor is so hard that Karreman is surprised the Rwandan team are happy to play on it. ""In Europe they would refuse to play on a floor this hard,"" he said. Real progress needs more funds. ""To get them really improved they need money. It is still a problem."" The difficulties were highlighted a few weeks earlier when it was revealed that the Rwandans were still almost $5,000 short for hosting the qualification tournament and were close to canceling it, and with it the team's Paralympic dream. Instead the British High Commissioner for Rwanda stepped in and found the cash. ""They have their (the government's) attention now,"" said Karreman before going back to his players for another grueling training session ""This will give a boost for the rest for the country that Rwanda is in London with this team."" 'Disability is nothing' The tournament went ahead, and Rwanda stole the show. They won every game, conceding just once, beating Kenya in the final 3-0 and qualifying for the Paralympics. They are still a long shot for a medal. As the coach points out , they would have to ""train 48 hours a day"" to get close. And other problems have arisen. The Rwandans had to cancel another regional tournament due to a lack of funds, a typical occurrence in African disability sport. Yet Bizimana believes that their appearance in London can send a message to those still struggling to come to terms with how their lives have changed forever in 1994 -- a message that resonates far outside this tiny, scarred African state. ""It is very difficult to have confidence, to accept what happened. Some people don't have. They are still fighting it,"" said Bizimana. ""I think we are superstars. For us disability is nothing. We are able. We are making sure we tell people disability is nothing. It is not inability.""","CNN talks to the Rwandan sitting volleyball team before the London Paralympics .

"Oskaloosa, Iowa (CNN) -- Republican Joni Ernst defended Tuesday her decision to abruptly cancel a meeting with the Des Moines Register Editorial Board last week, telling CNN ""it didn't make sense"" because she knew they would back her Democratic opponent. ""It was quite evident where they stood in this race and they were going to endorse my opponent,"" Ernst said in an interview at a campaign stop in Oskaloosa. The Des Moines Register endorsement is coveted in Iowa politics, and sitting down with editorial boards to answer questions is a long-held tradition not only in Iowa but nationwide. Ernst aides point to several editorials in the days leading up to the scheduled meeting as proof she wouldn't get a fair shake from the newspaper. Related: Ernst skips Des Moines Register meeting . A Des Moines Register editorial last week called Ernst ""naive"" for insisting that a constitutional amendment on so-called personhood that she co-sponsored in the state Senate is ""simply a statement that I support life."" But the same editorial also criticized her Democratic opponent, Bruce Braley. The race for the seat being vacated by retiring Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin is one of the most competitive contests this year, with recent polls showing Ernst with a slight lead or a statistical tie between the two. The seat would be a crucial pickup for Republicans on their quest to retake the upper chamber. After Ernst canceled her meeting with the Des Moines Register, its publisher issued a statement expressing his disappointment, but insisting that ""snubbing us or appearing before us won't be the final call in our endorsement."" This past Sunday the newspaper did in fact endorse Braley. Despite insisting the cancellation was not about avoiding tough questions, the reality is any editorial board is a tough room. Alison Lundergan Grimes got tripped up earlier this month at an editorial board meeting with the Courier Journal when she refused to say if she voted for President Barack Obama. Not taking such a risk so close the election comports with the Ernst campaign strategy right now, which is to exude confidence, likability and keep the focus on fixing a broken Washington. The question is whether Ernst defying tradition in a state that cherishes its traditions will hurt her with voters who are on the fence, especially if they think she was in fact avoiding tough questions. Ernst insists the best thing for her now is to follow the ultimate Iowa tradition, which is to be out and meeting voters. ""I really need to be on the trail and visiting with Iowans and making sure they have the opportunity to interact with me and ask me questions. that's the important thing at this point in time,"" Ernst told CNN.","Joni Ernst canceled a preplanned meeting with the Des Moines Register last week .

"(CNN) -- Hot, thirsty, frustrated and exhausted, British adventurers Alastair Humphreys and Leon McCarron were already feeling despair set in. At this early stage of their expedition to trek across the Arabian Peninsula's forbidding and desolate Empty Quarter, however, the pair had got no further than the wet sands of the English seaside town of Margate. Humphreys had hit on the idea of dragging their 300 kilograms of water and supplies for the 45-day 1,000-mile (1,609 km) expedition on a homemade steel cart, but as the pair labored to heave the heavily laden cart through the boggy sands of Margate on a test run, doubts were starting to set in. ""The purest way to have done the trip would have been camels but we couldn't afford it, so that ruled that out,"" Humphreys told CNN. ""I liked the aspect of the cart because it made it a physical challenge which appeals to me. Read more: Milking the desert in Saudi sands . ""The cart in theory was the right idea, but the cart in practice was absolutely terrible,"" he said. With no steering mechanism, the wrong sized wheels and a fundamentally flawed design, just six weeks later the pair flat-packed the conveyance to begin the long walk from Salalah in Oman to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. Undaunted, Humphreys and McCarron undertook the arduous journey with a budget of just Â£2,000 ($3,270) and made modifications to the cart on the road. ""I think it was a good demonstration that the main thing is to get out there and make stuff happen,"" he said. ""We could have spent a whole year in the UK to get sponsorship for some carbon fiber cart and we still wouldn't have done the trip."" If nothing, he said, the cart added to the comedy value of his film ""Into the Empty Quarter"", which was released last month. In the footsteps of Thesiger . The aim of the expedition was to retrace the footsteps of one of the legends of desert exploration, British adventurer Wilfred Thesiger, who in the 1940s on two separate trips charted vast tracts of the Empty Quarter -- or Rub' al Khali as it is known in Arabic -- a sea of sand dunes and flat featureless plains that spans modern day Oman, Yemen and Saudi Arabia. In his book ""Arabian Sands"" Thesiger wrote about his time in the Empty Quarter traveling with the tribal Bedu; tough men who lived by a desert code of honor, vengeance and intense loyalty. Read more: Will the world be wowed by Dubai's expo? Thesiger's books documented a vanishing way of life where survival depended on finding desert wells before camels died, avoiding the murderous raiding parties of other Bedu who had lost their herds and where water was sometimes so sparse that herders were known to drink camel vomit to survive. A changed landscape . Humphreys -- who could only follow part of Thesiger's journey in the Empty Quarter because they did not have visa access to Saudi Arabia - says the legendary explorer would not recognize the area today with its roads, oil installations and, at one point, even hamburger and kebab stands. ""Right from the start we were clear that weren't trying to exactly replicate his route -- it was purely a journey inspired by Thesiger,"" Humphreys said. ""If we'd really wanted to retrace his footsteps we would have ended the journey in Abu Dhabi rather than Dubai but we chose Dubai because it seemed like the complete antithesis of everything Thesiger appreciated about the desert and it really epitomizes the total transformation of that part of the world in the last 70 years."" Nevertheless, he says the pristine and crystalline beauty of the desert remains. ""I've been to quite a lot empty places and earlier that year I'd rowed across the Atlantic Ocean which sounds, on the surface, like two very different experiences but the two were actually very similar. Read more: Oxford, Yale or Abu Dhabi? ""We were a tiny bubble of life with all of our life -- food and water -- in this cart and our lives depended on our cart and each other. ""The landscape of the desert and the ocean seemed to me be on pause; they were completely unchanged for millions of years. It's a huge contrast to most of the environments we're used to in daily life which have been molded by mankind. ""In the desert, I felt that once we moved camp in the morning and our noise had moved on then that spot would be silent for thousands more years."" People of the desert . Like Thesiger, the micro-adventurers -- as Humphreys and McCarron like to call themselves -- said the landscape was made up of people as much as it was by sand dunes and harsh rocky plains. ""The locals we met were quite possibly the kindest, friendliest and most welcoming people I've ever met in the whole world -- they were just unbelievably generous -- but they thought what we were doing was completely crazy,"" Humphreys says. As passers-by stopped to take cell phone pictures, give them food or even sometimes press cash on the weary travelers, he said that contact with people on the ground confounded many of the negative stereotypes of the Middle East. ""It was very safe,"" Humphreys said. ""Before I went a lot of people were thinking ""Oh you're going to the Middle East you'll definitely be killed by Islamic terrorists"" but it was so much safer than even the United Kingdom."" Ultimately, he said they left with a deep respect for the people of the region some of whom were descended from the type of people that may have traveled with Thesiger. ""Only three generations might separate these people from the ones who accompanied Thesiger -- and they might get around now in air-conditioned SUVs -- but they haven't been removed from the desert long enough to think that going out into it and having a miserable time is a good idea. ""They thought we were complete idiots.""","Two British adventurers attempted to cross the Empty Quarter of the Arabian peninsula .

"(CNN) -- There are heads growing on Tony Dighera's farm, and they're not made of lettuce. They're called ""pumpkinsteins,"" and they look a lot like the Frankenstein creature that actor Boris Karloff made famous more than 80 years ago. ""Nobody's ever seen anything like it, ever,"" said Dighera of his creepy creations. ""It's so new, and it's so unique that demand has been off the charts,"" Dighera said. Dighera, who opened his Cinagro Farms eight years ago, says he was inspired after seeing cube-shaped watermelons grown in Japan. He was successful in creating not only edible, box-shaped watermelons at his Fillmore, California, organic farm, but heart-shaped melons as well. He then made the leap to try to create a unique-looking pumpkin -- a four-year process that is only proving fruitful this year. ""A lot of people thought I was nuts,"" the goateed farmer told CNN during a visit to see his crops. ""When I first started doing this I think every farmer in the world looked at me like I was a complete lunatic."" It was a scary prospect for Dighera, who says he not only invested all of his money, but also that of friends and family, as he experimented with different varieties of pumpkins and various materials and designs for the mold. An early design of the Frankenstein monster was dismissed as being too spooky, so the mouth was changed to create a slight smile. Dighera needed to create a strong mold that could encase a pumpkin, yet permit air to reach the growing gourd inside. 6 surprising health benefits of pumpkins . The pumpkin variety had to be just right. They couldn't be too big or they'd burst from the molds. Too small and the pumpkins wouldn't fill the molds. Dighera won't go into much more detail to protect his investment, but he's more than happy to share his reaction upon unveiling his first successful pumpkinstein. ""That first time we pulled it off, and it worked, we all looked at each other."" said Dighera, ""It was high fives all around."" But there's still a learning curve. Dighera says he produced 5,500 pumpkins this year, but that's only a 60% success rate. The biggest complications: heat, bugs and too much condensation, all of which can rot the pumpkins within the molds at any time during their more than three-month growing period. Dighera doesn't know whether he has a thriving pumpkinstein until he removes the nuts and bolts from the mold and successfully removes the pumpkin. If the pumpkin's shell sticks to the mold and tears during this final process, the squash is squashed. ""There's absolutely zero return on it,"" Dighera explained. 5 scary good Halloween treats . Dighera believes he's developed the skills now to produce a bumper crop of his creations next year. He predicts a 90% success rate totaling some 40,000 pumpkinsteins. But don't expect pumpkinsteins to boot jack-o'-lanterns off the porch completely. They're not cheap, costing $100 or more at some Southern California markets specializing in organic produce, such as Whole Foods and Erewhon. They are already sold out online at cinagro-farms.com. While the price scared off most customers with whom CNN spoke at Erewhon Market in Calabasas, California, all of them were fascinated at the Frankenstein farmer's feat. ""I've never seen anything like this,"" said 13-year-old Johnny Palla. ""It's really cool."" ""That's weird, but I like it,"" said Ashley Forster, calling the pumpkin a real Halloween eye-grabber. ""People would stop and look at it."" That's the novelty that Dighera is banking on, but he's already creating something to rival his own pumpkinsteins. He says he'll be planting white pumpkins and growing them in the shape of skulls, another face to help get this farmer ahead next Halloween.","Tony Dighera has been experimenting with pumpkins and molds .

"Gardena, California (CNN) -- About 300 mourners remembered legendary singer Etta James on Saturday as an authentic voice whose velvety vocals bridged genres from blues to rock. Another legendary singer, Stevie Wonder, gave a musical tribute to James at her funeral: He played the electronic keyboard and sang his ""Shelter in the Rain."" He then performed on the harmonica and sang The Lord's Prayer. Also performing at the service was Christina Aguilera, who sang James' signature song ""At Last"" and ended her rendition to a standing audience with a farewell directed at James' casket: ""May you rest in peace."" After the service, Aguilera told CNN that James was her idol. ""It was so emotional,"" Aguilera said. ""I went through the lyrics last night, and I did rehearsal ... and it took on a whole new meaning having been invited by her close friends and family to sing that classic song at her service. And I started crying every time I started to sing it, and I thought, 'My gosh, what if that happens tomorrow? I just want to do justice to Etta James. She meant the whole world to me, and it was a huge honor to be here today."" The Rev. Al Sharpton presided over the funeral in southern California where James was raised, and he began the service by reading aloud a note from President Barack Obama, who said that James' talents transcended genres. Obama wrote that James will be remembered for her voice, Sharpton told family and friends at Greater Bethany Community Church City of Refuge in Gardena. ""I know she will be sorely missed by all those who knew and loved her,"" the president's note said, according to Sharpton. James died January 20 at the age of 73 of complications due to leukemia at a hospital in Riverside, California. She would have turned 74 last Wednesday. Her assertive, earthy voice lit up such hits as ""The Wallflower,"" ""Something's Got a Hold on Me"" and the wedding favorite ""At Last."" Sharpton said that James first developed her voice in a local Baptist church as a little girl singing gospel -- which ""was just race music when she started."" When she died this month, he said, her photograph appeared on the front page of the New York Times, a mark of a triumphant life. ""Etta James has given us too much to work with,"" Sharpton said. ""Etta James was for real. She was authentic. ""I think it was her authenticity that was part of the charisma that drew people to her,"" Sharpton said. ""She really became a bridge of American culture that changed the culture of the world. It was Etta James that bridged rhythm and blues with rock and roll. ""Etta James helped break down the culture curtain of America before the Civil Rights Act of 1964,"" Sharpton eulogized. ""She was able to get us to sing the same rhythms and melodies."" Evoking the title of a signature song of James, Sharpton raised his voice: ""At last, you can find peace now! ""At last, you can get the gratitude of the savior now,"" Sharpton continued. ""Etta, you made it, you're going home. At last! At last! At last!"" Donto James, the older of James' sons, recalled how his mother had a soft spot for anyone who lost their mother. Donto James played drums in his mother's band. ""She'd give them a job like that,"" he told the mourners. ""She loved her band. She would pick up anybody to work for,"" he added. In a lighter moment, the son recalled how high-spirited his mother was. ""She was feisty, very feisty,"" he said. ""I found myself as a son trying to clean up some things. I should have tried to stay out of it. I don't know what I was doing."" Fans got the opportunity Friday to bid farewell to James during a public viewing at the Inglewood Cemetery Mortuary. Hundreds of people waited for hours to sign registers and attend the viewing for James. The family has requested donations be sent to The Rhythm & Blues Foundation. The powerhouse singer, known as ""Miss Peaches,"" first hit the charts as a teenager, taking ""The Wallflower (Roll With Me, Henry)"" -- an ""answer record"" to Hank Ballard's ""Work With Me, Annie"" -- to No. 1 on the R&B charts in 1955. She joined Chess Records in 1960 and had a string of R&B and pop hits, many with lush string arrangements. After a mid-decade fade, she re-emerged in 1967 with a more hard-edged, soulful sound. Throughout her career, James overcame a heroin addiction, opened for the Rolling Stones, won six Grammys and was voted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Despite her ups and downs -- including a number of health problems -- she maintained an optimistic attitude. ""Most of the songs I sing, they have that blue feeling to it. They have that sorry feeling. And I don't know what I'm sorry about,"" she told CNN's Denise Quan in 2002. ""I don't!"" Through it all, she was a spitfire beloved by contemporaries and young up-and-comers. ""Etta James is unmanageable, and I'm the closest thing she's ever had to a manager,"" Lupe De Leon, her manager of 30-plus years, told CNN. British songstress Adele named James as one of her favorite singers, along with Aretha Franklin. ""If you were to look up the word 'singer' in the dictionary, you'd see their names,"" Adele said in an interview. Etta James was born Jamesetta Hawkins in south Los Angeles to a teen mother and unknown father. She suspected her father was Rudolph Wanderone Jr., the famous pool hustler known as Minnesota Fats.

"(CNN) -- With the search for the wreckage of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 now concentrated in the southern Indian Ocean, any debris found could give investigators some clues as to what happened to the jetliner. Scorch marks or soot would indicate there was a fire on board. How pieces of metal were bent or torn could tell investigators how the plane hit the water or whether it broke up in mid-air, several experts told CNN. But the real prize is the doomed jet's flight data recorder, which may be far more difficult to recover. ""The debris that's floating is valuable. It can give us some information for the investigation,"" retired U.S. Navy Capt. Bobbie Scholley told CNN. ""But we really still want to get the priority, which are the 'black boxes' of course, which will be on the bottom."" Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak announced Monday that a new analysis of satellite data puts Flight 370's last position ""far from any possible landing sites."" The airline notified the families of the 239 passengers and crew that ""all lives are lost,"" as one of those relatives told CNN. Aircraft and ships have been watching the seas far off Australia in search of possible wreckage from the Boeing 777 for days now after satellite photos turned up what could be debris from the doomed plane. How 'groundbreaking' number crunching found path of Flight 370 . That the search is concentrated so far off its planned Kuala Lumpur-to-Beijing course strongly suggests the crew was incapacitated, former pilot Alastair Rosenschein told CNN's ""New Day."" ""Let's be very clear about this: The aircraft would not have been in that location had the pilots had control of the aircraft, had they been conscious and had they had the desire to save their lives and land somewhere,"" Rosenschein said as the search commenced last week. ""So I would go on the premise that if the aircraft went down there, it was uncontrolled and ran out of fuel,"" he said. ""And in fact, that location is consistent with the full length of time the aircraft could fly with the fuel load it had."" Former Air Force accident investigator Alan Diehl said the wreckage may show signs of a fire or explosion. The cockpit itself, if recovered, might reveal signs of fire or whether the jet's emergency oxygen system had been activated. ""Impact damage, certainly at the visible and especially at the microscopic level, looks a lot different than an explosion,"" he said. And former commercial pilot Shawn Pruchnicki said pieces should reveal whether the plane plunged nose-first into the ocean, whether it gradually descended or whether it disintegrated overhead. ""We're going to be able to tell that by looking at the wreckage and looking at the deformity, now not only (how) it's compressed but how it's torn,"" said Pruchnicki, who teaches aviation safety at Ohio State University. 'They have told us all lives are lost' Another marker of the tragedy -- bodies -- may yield more clues if found, Diehl said. Autopsies would reveal signs of smoke inhalation, while the extent of trauma might indicate how hard the aircraft hit the water, he said. But why the aircraft ended up in the middle of nowhere is something the wreckage is unlikely to answer. That's what makes finding the flight recorders, especially the flight data recorder, so important, said Mary Schiavo, a former Transportation Department inspector-general and CNN aviation analyst. ""If the pilots were not speaking and there is no clicks or sounds of equipment, the cockpit voice recorder is not going to be a lot of help,"" Schiavo said. ""But the data recorder will be a gold mine of information and it will literally tell everything that the plane did."" Another problem is the battery life on the locator beacons attached to the flight recorders. They are designed to transmit for at least 30 days, but could last up to five days longer, the manufacturer's president told CNN. Finding those recorders will get more difficult with time, as debris starts to sink or get spread around by wind and ocean currents, former Navy captain Scholley said. The flight recorders are likely on the bottom already, she said: Searchers need to get ships into the suspected crash area ""and try to get those eyes on any debris that we can find before that debris sinks and we lose that part of this search forever."" ""Some of this debris may go on forever and end up washing ashore eventually, but by that time it is just too late for the investigation,"" she said.","Bent, deformed or scorched metal could reveal clues to investigators .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Former D.C. mayor, now Washington councilman, Marion Barry has been arrested again. Former D.C. Mayor Marion Barry was arrested July 4 and charged with stalking, police said. On July 4, the U.S. Park Police arrested Barry and charged him with misdemeanor stalking. About 8:45 p.m. in Anacostia Park, a Washington woman flagged down a Park Police officer on patrol and pointed to Barry, who was in another car. The woman said Barry was stalking her, Park Police spokesman Sgt. David Schlosser said. Barry was taken into custody, processed and released, but he must make a court appearance for the charge. A court date has not been set. Barry's other run-ins with the law have included a federal sting operation in 1990, when he was mayor. Surveillance cameras caught him smoking crack cocaine in a hotel room. Despite his fall from grace, he was re-elected in 1994 to a four-year term as mayor. In his latest political comeback in 2004, Barry won a seat on the D.C. Council, on which he continues to serve. Barry was arrested in 2002 when traces of marijuana and cocaine were found in his car after he was stopped in the Buzzard Point area of Southwest D.C. No charges were filed, and Barry claimed that the drugs were planted. And in 2006, Park Police officers stopped him for driving too slowly, prompting him to accuse authorities of targeting him. Barry had been on probation since 2005 for not filing or paying income taxes for several years. Last year he again failed to file a tax return, and his probation was extended to May 2011, according to the Washington City Paper.","U.S. Park Police charged former mayor with misdemeanor stalking .

"New York (CNN) -- Osama bin Laden's son-in-law was found guilty Wednesday in New York of helping al Qaeda terrorists conspire to kill Americans and providing material support to terrorists. Federal prosecutors said at Sulaiman Abu Ghaith's trial that the Kuwaiti cleric played a crucial role as the organization's principal mouthpiece and recruiter, helping ""restore al Qaeda's trove of new terrorists"" as deadly missions turned its members into martyrs. Abu Ghaith, wearing a dark suit, displayed no reaction as the verdict from an anonymous jury of nine women and three men was read. The jury deliberated about 5Â½ hours. As the defendant was being escorted out the packed courtroom, there was a slight smile on his face. ""A jury unanimously found that Sulaiman Abu Ghayth not only conspired to provide, and actually provided, material support to al Qaeda, but also conspired to kill Americans,"" Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a prepared statement. ""He was more than just Usama bin Laden's propaganda minister. Within hours after the devastating 9/11 attacks, Abu Ghayth was using his position in al Qaeda's homicidal hierarchy to persuade others to pledge themselves to al Qaeda in the cause of murdering more Americans."" Abu Ghaith's attorney, Stan Cohen, described his client as stoic and at peace. ""He has confidence this is not the end, but the beginning,"" said Cohen, adding that the defense was confident about an appeal. Abu Ghaith, 48, faces life in prison at sentencing on September 8. The government did not allege that Abu Ghaith served an operational function or had a direct hand in carrying out the attacks. Bharara added: ""Like the others who have faced terrorism charges in Manhattan's federal courthouse before him, Abu Ghayth received a fair trial, after which a unanimous jury rendered its verdict, justly holding him accountable for his crimes. We hope this verdict brings some small measure of comfort to the families of the victims of al Qaeda's murderous designs."" In a statement, George Venizelos, assistant director in charge of the FBI's New York field office, likened Abu Ghaith to ""a consigliere for the mob or the chief of staff to a corrupt foreign leader"" and said he was a ""spokesman, confidant and senior adviser"" to bin Laden's organization. Abu Ghaith ""looked to better al Qaeda's reputation at every turn, offering advice and counsel to the organization's senior leadership. He encouraged others to abandon the true tenets of their faith, swearing bayat to the twisted ideology of al Qaeda,"" Venizelos said, using the Islamic word for allegiance. The trial was held blocks from the site of Manhattan's World Trade Center, and several survivors of the attacks and family members of victims attended. ""Without people like him, al Qaeda dies with every suicide attack,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney John Cronan said in his closing argument Monday. Abu Ghaith testified last week that he never joined the ranks of al Qaeda and assisted bin Laden only as a speaker on spiritual topics. Known in the Persian Gulf region as a religious scholar and fiery orator, Abu Ghaith met the al Qaeda leader in Afghanistan in June 2001, according to testimony. He denied advance knowledge of the 9/11 attacks but said he'd heard talk that ""something big"" was about to happen. He moved his family from Afghanistan to Kuwait days before the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York's World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Just after the attacks, the al Qaeda leader summoned Abu Ghaith to his remote mountain hiding place and asked him to help ""deliver a message to the world"" on the organization's behalf, the religious scholar testified. After his arrest last year in Jordan, activists and legislators sparred over where to try Abu Ghaith, with some calling for the case to be heard in a military courtroom at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Instead, the trial took place amid extra security measures in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. The jury watched several videos produced after the meeting with the al Qaeda leader, of Abu Ghaith making passionate calls for further attacks on Americans, flanked by bin Laden on one side and an AK-47 rifle on the other. He called for fellow Muslims to ""terrorize the infidels"" and vowed the ""storm of airplanes will not abate,"" a phrase he said on the stand was given to him in ""bullet points"" provided by bin Laden for the speeches. Cohen, the defense attorney, accused prosecutors of using 9/11 imagery in lieu of evidence of his client's guilt and told the jurors Monday he counted 172 references to bin Laden and 9/11 in the first half of the prosecution's closing argument. ""It was intended to sweep you away in anguish and pain and to ask for retaliation. It was intended to make you look away from the evidence,"" Cohen told the panel. He said none of the government's witnesses conclusively tied his client to terrorism-related activities, including a terrorism specialist with the FBI and two cooperating former al Qaeda members. CNN's Ray Sanchez and Lawrence Crook III contributed to this report.","Sulaiman Abu Ghaith was found guilty of conspiring to kill Americans .

"(CNN) -- I was born in Mumbai, India -- a beautiful country rich in culture and landscape. But for all its wonder and charm, India is also a country where from 150,000 to 200,000 people were afflicted by polio in the mid-1980s and, even as recently as 2009, was home to nearly half the world's new polio cases. Polio is a debilitating disease. It attacks the nervous system and can lead to partial or full paralysis for life, and in some cases, even death. But, the great news is that today, India and Southeast Asia were officially certified by the World Health Organization as being polio-free -- a momentous achievement for global public health and the worldwide effort to eradicate polio. India beats the odds and beats polio . But this extraordinary feat wasn't easy. Most experts believed that India, with its high population density, poor health care services and regional accessibility problems, would remain the most polio-endemic region in the world. But India hasn't reported a new case since early 2011, which led WHO Director-General Margaret Chan to say: ""India has shown the world that there is no such thing as impossible. This is likely the greatest lesson and the greatest inspiration for the rest of the world."" I, too, believe this is the greatest inspiration for the world. This victory -- like the eradication of smallpox -- is one of the most amazing achievements in global health. And I'm humbled to support and commend my country -- and the communities, families and workers on the ground -- for without them, this would not be possible. Their bravery, grace and conviction to end polio once and for all is something of great strength and admiration. Great achievements don't just happen; they require the great efforts of many. The polio eradication movement, started in 1988, was a joint effort between the Indian government; WHO; Rotary International; the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; UNICEF and various other NGOs; the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and about 2 million workers who vaccinated nearly 170 million throughout the country to finally wipe out the disease. Truly, this worldwide effort should serve as a reminder that when the global community bands together to solve an issue, great things can be achieved. And today should serve as a call to not simply continue the efforts but to exponentially increase them. The tireless work and the steadfast determination of so many around the world has brought us to this monumental milestone today, because with committed people, volunteers, communities and cooperation comes real change. Just last year, I joined the Global Poverty Project at the annual Global Citizen Festival on the Great Lawn at Central Park in New York to advocate for an end to extreme poverty by 2030. Chief among the priorities was a focus on health, vaccines and immunizations. And on that day, looking out at the sea of 60,000 Global Citizens advocating for change and an end to polio by 2018, I knew the end was possible. So, smile as we celebrate a polio-free India -- a significant public health achievement that will leave a lasting impact on children's health in India and around the world. This can inspire the global community to take on other diseases as well. A polio-free India is not a polio-free world, and we must remain vigilant to ensure every child around the globe receives the vaccine until we achieve a world free of polio. The global health community is still more than $1 billion short on funding for vaccinations -- and while the United States, Canada and others have led the way -- other countries such as Australia need to reaffirm their support. Only three nations have yet to eradicate the crippling disease: Nigeria, Pakistan and Afghanistan. As we declare India polio-free, we can call on countries and governments around the globe to follow this tremendous example and make the world free of polio by 2018. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Freida Pinto.","Freida Pinto: World Health Organization on Thursday is proclaiming India to be polio free .
India had half the world's new cases in 2009, and 200,000 in the 1980s .

"Hampton, Florida (CNN) -- It's do-or-die time in a city that has been threatened with extinction, become a symbol of small-town corruption and even been mocked in the media as ""too Florida, even for Florida."" Can this worn-down, one-stoplight city prove to detractors that it can save its very soul from the venal forces that tempted it to set up a speed trap, rake in $1 million over the past few years and then lose track of the money? State lawmakers are traveling tonight to the Victory Baptist Church to see for themselves whether Hampton has been scared straight. If state Sen. Rob Bradley and state Rep. Charles Van Zant don't like what they hear, they have vowed to move forward with a bill to dissolve the city's charter. It would be an extreme measure, for sure, and the first time anyone can remember the Florida legislature taking away a municipality's right to govern itself. Some, like Bradley, say residents would hardly notice the difference. Hampton's library would still lend out books. Kids would still attend the award-winning local elementary school. The parks would still be open. And the county sheriff already has taken over patrolling the streets. All Hampton's residents would be missing, Bradley has said, is about $100 a year in city taxes and an unnecessary layer of government that didn't serve them very well in the first place. But losing their cityhood would be a devastating blow to Hampton's collective sense of pride. Residents think their city is worth fighting for. And so, for the past month, they've been coming up with a way to save Hampton. A Facebook page dedicated to the cause has grown to 309 followers -- big doings in a city with fewer than 500 people in it. The scandal that set tongues wagging . Writing tickets began innocently enough, said Hampton's newly appointed city attorney, John Cooper, who's donating his services during the crisis. A Texaco station out on U.S. 301 asked for police protection, and Hampton agreed to annex a 1,200-foot stretch of highway. Only later did someone come up with the idea that there was plenty of easy money to be made from catching speeders and writing tickets, just like neighboring cities Waldo and Lawtey were doing. And so, Hampton officially became a notorious speed trap. The way the city map was redrawn, it looked like a giant mosquito, with Hampton sucking money directly from the highway. Problem was, the police department constantly overspent its budget, and all that ticket revenue never seemed to benefit anybody outside of City Hall. The police department swelled to 19 officers, including the chief. But Bradford County Sheriff Gordon Smith says many of the officers weren't trained properly, and the audit found that some of them drove uninsured vehicles. One officer, nicknamed ""Rambo,"" dressed in tactical gear and strapped an assault rifle across his chest -- just to write tickets. 2011 was Hampton's bumper year for tickets -- and it also was the year Rep. Van Zant was caught by Hampton's radar guns. He promptly paid his ticket, but the experience reminded him of the growing stack of citizen complaints. In April 2013, Van Zant asked the state auditor general to look into the city's finances. Barry Layne Moore came into the mayor's office last fall promising things were going to change. By then, the auditors had visited City Hall, and people had a sense bad news was coming. But they still had no idea how bad. Moore barely had time to trim the hedges before he was snagged in a sheriff's sting operation. According to court documents, he allegedly sold a single, 30-milligram oxycodone pill -- a ""blueberry"" in street terms -- to an undercover informant for $20. The mayor was sitting in the Bradford County jail in February when the audit was formally released and the battle for the 89-year-old city's survival began. The audit was scathing, citing violations of Hampton's city charter, as well as state and federal tax codes. The audit found plenty of other irregularities that shocked lawmakers -- including rampant nepotism, double-dipping and runaway expenses. There were duplicate payroll checks, a $132,000 credit account at the local BP station and convenience store and $27,000 in charges run up on a credit card for items that ""served no public purpose."" In all, the 31 violations read like a text book of municipal malfeasance. Read the audit [PDF] . Legislators Bradley and Van Zant called for Hampton's demise. ""Why is this even a city?"" Bradley wondered. The two men met with residents last month at the Bradford County Courthouse and were taken aback by the passion of their pleas to spare Hampton. Some residents said yanking the charter would be like victimizing them twice. A criminal investigation is under way as Hampton continues to fight for its life. The lawmakers issued a list of conditions city officials would have to meet if Hampton is to survive as a city. Basically, Hampton was told it would have to elect a new city council, hire a new staff, give back the annexed strip of land along U.S. 301 and get out of the speed trap business for good. Police Chief John Hodges, City Clerk Jan Hall and her son, chief maintenance worker Adam Hall, had already quit or been fired by then. After the lawmakers delivered their list of demands, City Council member Charles Norris Hall, the clerk's husband, submitted his resignation. The center of government was no longer what former mayor Jim Mitzel called Hampton's ""City of Halls."" Moore resigned as mayor from the jail, where he is awaiting trial on the drug charge. He had been suspended since his arrest. The city attorney also resigned. The remaining council members replaced councilman Hall with a Baptist preacher and brought Cooper on board as the city attorney. If it survives, Hampton will hold a special election in September. The four members of the city council -- including a deputy who works at the jail and who hand-delivered Moore's resignation letter -- have agreed to resign after the election. The city also will vote to amend its 1925 charter, eliminating its police force. There literally will be a new sheriff in town. Hampton also is in the process of adopting an ordinance that would release the annexed strip of U.S. 301. It will hold onto the strip of land along County Road 18, because a water line serves a new subdivision there, but Hampton will no longer touch U.S. 301. Cooper, the city attorney, said he is optimistic that Hampton can convince its critics that it has cleaned up its act. ""Each of these items has been addressed, or we are addressing it,"" he said. ""If we are operating within the statutes and within the law and our citizens want their city, they should be open to it. ""Hampton's been there a long time.""","Hampton expects to learn fate at tonight's meeting with Florida lawmakers .

"(CNN) -- Six Americans imprisoned in Honduras for more than a month on charges they attempted to smuggle weapons into the country are now free. A family member of one of the former captives and a U.S. congressman, who had traveled to the Central American nation to inquire about the Americans, said Thursday that the men were out of prison and headed home. ""It is with great pleasure I am able to announce the safe release of the six Americans wrongfully imprisoned in Honduras,"" Rep. Mike Fitzpatrick, a Pennsylvania Republican, said in a statement. ""The crew of the Aqua Quest -- including the son of one of my constituents -- is in the process of traveling back to the United States and being reunited with their families following the ordeal."" The Americans were in Honduras to work with local officials in the impoverished, rural municipality of Ahuas to remove valuable mahogany logs from a nearby riverbed, remnants of decades of logging. Profits from the sale of the recovered logs would be split between the salvage company and the municipality for a social project there. But this project ended abruptly with their arrest May 5, after Honduran authorities boarded their ship and discovered a couple of handguns, two shotguns and a semiautomatic rifle. The ship's captain, Robert Mayne, told CNN by cell phone from his prison cell that the weapons were for protection against piracy while at sea. ""Everyone tells us this would never happen in any other port in Honduras,"" he said earlier this month, expressing his frustration with the judge's and state prosecutor's interpretation of the law. ""We have the right to do it (carry arms) for protection on the high seas."" His brother Stephen Mayne, who owns Aqua Quest International, said he received word Thursday that the charges against his brother and the rest of the crew had been dropped.

"(CNN) -- Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez on Wednesday said the country welcomes the return of its children detained while trying to enter the United States and has created an interagency committee to tackle the humanitarian crisis. His comments appeared to expand on statements made earlier by a Foreign Ministry official who called for a proposal asking the United States to stop deporting Honduran children. Foreign Ministry spokesman Julio Lopez Tercero told CNN that the ministry, which is part of the interagency committee, plans to ask the U.S. government to allow children with parents in the United States to reunite in America. However, he said, some minors will end up deported, and in those cases, Honduran officials ask that deportation proceedings occur in a humane way. In a statement released on the President's official website, Hernandez said, ""The idea is to return these children and youth to Honduras once they've been located, and give them state support to get ahead."" His office estimates that 13,000 of the minors could be Honduran. The statement comes one day after Chancellor Mireya Aguero Corrales said she had instructed her country's embassy in Washington to draw up a plan to ask the United States to stop deporting children amid the humanitarian crisis. Children without parents have been streaming across the Mexico-United States border in unprecedented numbers. Most of them are from Honduras, Guatemala or El Salvador. Many have been smuggled north without official papers and hope to find their parents or family members already living in the United States. The ones apprehended by American authorities are often housed in shelters. Federal law says minors cannot be held at a Border Patrol facility for more than 72 hours. They have to be processed and then either sent to live with a relative in the United States or released to a shelter operated by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which falls under the Department of Health and Human Services. The refugee office operates about 100 permanent shelters for unaccompanied minors, according to spokesman Kenneth Wolfe. The shelters are filled to capacity. The surge in children crossing the border has forced authorities to open three temporary shelters at military bases -- Lackland Air Force Base in Texas, Fort Sill in Oklahoma and Naval Base Ventura County in California. U.S. authorities estimate that between 60,000 and 80,000 children without parents will cross the border this year. Hernandez said he formed an interagency committee led by first lady Ana Garcia to find the thousands of Honduran children living in temporary American shelters. The first lady made a call to parents, ""asking them to take birth certificates, photos or any other pertinent document to prepare a dossier for each girl, boy and teenager. This will be tremendously helpful to us to get our kids repatriated."" She says the overall goal is to reunite children with their parents.","Honduran President wants detained, unaccompanied minors returned to Honduras .

"New York (CNN) -- An apparent dispute over housing ended with an 86-year-old New York man shooting his grandson and killing his grandson's girlfriend before fatally shooting himself, a law enforcement source said Saturday. Police were still trying to sort out what led Heriberto Pagan to drive from his home in Brooklyn to his daughter's Staten Island house Friday and shoot two people before taking his own life. A law enforcement source said investigators were looking into the possibility that the grandson ""was trying to take over"" the home with his girlfriend and Pagan ""wasn't appreciative of the way"" his daughter was being treated in the process. It was not clear whether the daughter was at home at the time. Police found Pagan, a gunshot wound to the head, outside his car Friday evening near the home where the shootings occurred. He was hospitalized in critical condition, but died Saturday morning, police said. In the vicinity, police were alerted to another shooting victim, Pagan's 47-year-old grandson, who was critically injured with a gunshot wound to the head and found outside the Staten Island house where he lived with his mother and girlfriend. The grandson has not been identified. Inside the house, police found a second victim, Claritle Christina Huerta, 28, also shot in the head. She was pronounced dead at a local hospital. ""This is like a nightmare,"" neighbor John Rina told CNN affiliate WCBS. Police said Pagan shot his grandson as the younger man approached the house. He then shot Huerta inside before driving a few blocks and shooting himself, authorities said. ""I just heard a man screaming 'help me, help me,'"" a neighbor, not identified, told WCBS. A 4-month-old boy was found unharmed in the home and placed in the care of child welfare authorities, police said. ""There [were] a lot of problems in that house, I could say, but it never really exploded the way it [did] today,"" an unidentified neighbor told CNN affiliate NY1 News. ""This is actually probably a buildup to everything that's been happening for ... years.""

"New York (CNN) -- A mandatory 21-day quarantine imposed by New York and New Jersey on health care workers returning from West Africa after treating Ebola patients caught local and federal officials by surprise and spurred a heated debate on handling the spread of the virus. The policy of isolating medical personnel and others arriving from Ebola-affected countries zones was abruptly implemented Friday by the governors of New York and New Jersey, Andrew Cuomo and Chris Christie. The announcement came one day after a New York doctor who treated patients in Guinea became the first Ebola case diagnosed in the city and the fourth in the United States. The mandate came as a surprise to the federal Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention in Atlanta, according to a federal official familiar with the situation. ""They're not happy,"" the official said of the CDC. ""These two governors said, 'Take this, federal government.' They're very worried we won't be able to get physicians or nurses to go (to countries affected by the Ebola outbreak)."" Should health care workers be quarantined? A New York City official called more stringent screening ""a real stunner."" ""They did this without consulting the city, and that's not a good thing,"" the official said of Cuomo and Christie. ""They didn't let anyone know in advance."" Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity. Illinois will require ""high-risk individuals who have had direct contact with an individual infected with the Ebola virus while in Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea"" to undergo a mandatory 21-day home quarantine, according to a press release from Governor Pat Quinn's office released on Friday. On Saturday, the CDC said that it sets the baseline recommended standards, but state and local officials have the prerogative to set tighter policies. ""When it comes to the federal standards set by the CDC, we will consider any measures that we believe have the potential to make the American people safer,"" the CDC said in a statement. Nurse worried about mandatory quarantines . The two-state policy was implemented the same day that nurse Kaci Hickox landed at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey after working with Doctors Without Borders in treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone. Hickox, in an Op-Ed piece in The Dallas Morning News, wrote that she was ordered placed in quarantine at a hospital, where she tested negative in a preliminary test for Ebola. Still, hospital officials told her she must remain under mandatory quarantine for 21 days. Hickox wrote that she was held at the airport and questioned by various health workers after her flight landed about 1 p.m. At first, her temperature -- taken with forehead scanner -- was 98 degrees. Hours later, her cheeks flushed with anger over being held without explanation, another scanner check recorded her temperature as 101 degrees, she wrote. Hickox eventually got a police escort, sirens blaring, to a hospital, when her temperature was again checked in an outdoor tent. On the oral thermometer, her temperature was recorded as 98.6. And she tested negative for Ebola, she wrote in the Dallas newspaper. A second test by the CDC confirmed the finding. In a statement released Saturday, Doctors Without Borders, or Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), said there was a ""notable lack of clarity"" about the guidelines released by New York and New Jersey. ""We are attempting to clarify the details of the protocols with each state's departments of health to gain a full understanding of their requirements and implications,"" MSF said. ""While measures to protect public health are of paramount importance, they must be balanced against the rights of health workers returning from fighting the Ebola outbreak in West Africa to fair and reasonable treatment and the full disclosure of information to them, along with information about intended courses of action from local and state health authorities."" New York City Health Commissioner Dr. Mary Bassett is concerned that the mandatory quarantine will discourage doctors and nurses from volunteering to take care of Ebola patients in West Africa, according to her spokeswoman. ""We just want to make sure we don't inadvertently discourage volunteers who are going to West Africa to help control this epidemic,""said health department spokeswoman Jean Weinberg. The new airport screening procedures require anyone who had direct contact with Ebola patients to remain in quarantine for up to three weeks. In addition, people with a travel history to the affected regions but with no direct contact with Ebola patients will be ""actively monitored ... and, if necessary, quarantined,"" according to the new policy. ""This is not the time to take chances,"" Cuomo said Friday. ""This adjustment in increasing the screening procedures is necessary. ... I think public safety and public health have to be balanced and I think this policy does that."" New federal policy starts Monday . The new guidelines add to the federal policy requiring all travelers coming to the United States from Ebola-affected areas to be actively monitored for 21 days, starting Monday. Already, such travelers landing at five U.S. airports -- New York's Kennedy, Dulles International, New Jersey's Newark Liberty International, Chicago's O'Hare International and Hartsfield-Jackson International in Atlanta -- must go through enhanced screening. Ebola has killed nearly 5,000 people, mostly in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, in what health officials call the worst outbreak of the disease in history. On Friday, the National Institutes of Health said Nina Pham, a Dallas nurse, had been declared free of the Ebola virus. Public health experts say there's plenty of scientific evidence indicating that there's very little chance that a random person will get Ebola, unless he or she is in very close contact -- close enough to share bodily fluids -- with someone who has it. How the Ebola virus spreads . New York Ebola patient's fiancee cleared . On Thursday, a New York doctor who had traveled on a humanitarian mission to Guinea, where he had treated Ebola patients, developed symptoms and has been hospitalized in Manhattan. Dr. Craig Spencer, 33, is in isolation at Bellevue Hospital in New York City. He arrived back from Guinea on October 17 and had limited his public interactions but did not eliminate them, according to officials. On the same day Cuomo and Christie announced the new guidelines, Ebola survivor Nancy Writebol donated plasma to Spencer, said the charity SIM. Writebol was one of the first two Americans diagnosed with the Ebola virus. She was successfully treated at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta in August. Spencer's fiancee, Morgan Dixon, had been under quarantine at Bellevue, but was cleared and has no symptoms, according to Jean Weinberg, a city health department spokeswoman. On Saturday night, Dixon returned home to the hazmat-cleaned apartment she shares with Spencer in Manhattan. Dixon's family members have not been in physical contact with her or Spencer since his return from West Africa, according to a family statement. Two friends of Spencer are under quarantine outside the hospital and are being monitored, though they feel healthy. Dr. Jay Varma, deputy commissioner for disease control at the city health department, held a news conference outside said the woman would be under quarantine for 21 days and that she is healthy. She is not allowed visitors and groceries will be delivered to her apartment. Spencer's activities, which include riding in subways and cabs, have sparked a sharp public debate about how to deal with people who have traveled to West African countries ravaged by the disease. On Saturday, one of the places visited by the Spencer, The Gutter bowling alley in Brooklyn, reopened after extensive decontamination work. And New York Mayor Bill de Blasio dined on meatballs at a Manhattan restaurant visited by the doctor. Should the focus of American policy be to do everything to prevent anyone who has visited the most ravaged regions from entering the United States, even if it discourages health care workers from going there? Some U.S. lawmakers, such as Rep. Andy Harris, favor a strict three-week quarantine. (That duration is significant because it takes anywhere from two to 21 days from the time a person is exposed to Ebola to when he or she shows symptoms of it; if more time than that passes without symptoms, a person is considered Ebola-free.) ""In return from being allowed to come back into the country from a place where a deadly disease is endemic, you'd have to enter a quarantine facility and be supervised for 21 days,"" the Maryland Republican told CNN. But other officials say while that policy could prevent some cases of Ebola in the United States over the short term, it could backfire if highly trained American doctors have less incentive to travel to Africa to fight the disease. ""These individuals who are going there to serve are the people who will end this crisis,"" de Blasio said. ""We can't have the illusion that we can turn away from it and some day it may end. If we took that attitude, this would be a truly devastating global crisis."" Complete coverage on Ebola .

"(CNN) -- A daughter of Ariel Castro, the primary suspect in the abduction of three women found alive this week, is serving a 25-year sentence in an Indiana prison for the attempted murder of her baby six years ago. Emily Castro was sentenced to 30 years with five years suspended. A judge found Castro guilty but mentally ill of cutting her 11-month-old daughter four times on the neck in April 2007. An appeal, filed in late 2008, was denied by an Indiana court. Legal documents state that on April 4, 2007, Castro, 19 at the time, was upset that her boyfriend -- the baby's father -- had moved out of the family's home in Fort Wayne. She took the baby into a garage and cut her neck four times with a knife. Castro also cut her own neck and wrists. Inside the Cleveland house . Police were summoned to the house by a passerby who came upon Castro's mother carrying the baby and running from the home. Officers found Castro covered in mud, water and blood. Castro told paramedics she had tried to drown herself in a creek, according to an appeals court decision document. The baby survived. According to the Fort Wayne Journal Gazette, the defense argued at trial that Castro had suffered from mental depression and became paranoid, thinking her family was trying to kill her and the baby. The judge found that Castro still had the ability to know right from wrong. She and her brother Anthony spoke at her sentencing hearing, the Journal Gazette reported. ""I don't know how this happened,"" said Castro. ""I want you to know I am a very good mom."" Anthony Castro said his sister was not an animal.

"(CNN) -- All Royal Canadian Mounted Police ""understand the risks that come with the uniform,"" Canada's governor general said. Five Mounties surely had those risks on their minds this week when they responded to a call about a gunman in Moncton, New Brunswick. And it didn't stop them from defending the quiet, tight-knit community of 70,000, located about 250 miles northeast of Bangor, Maine, Wednesday, their supervisors say. The call said the man, now identified as Justin Bourque, 24, was on a Moncton road, wielding a firearm. Soon, shots rang out on the road, as Bourque fled into the woods, where more shots were fired. Over a ""short period of time,"" Bourque allegedly shot five officers, killing three and wounding two others, said Codiac RCMP Superintendent Marlene Snowman said. The two injured officers required surgery on Thursday, police said. One has been released, while the other remains hospitalized. Canada's National Post newspaper is calling it the nation's worst police tragedy in more than nine years, when four Mounties were ambushed and killed during a property seizure in Mayerthorpe, Alberta. Canadian media at the time touted that tragedy as the worst in a century. ""I can't begin to explain the sadness we feel. ... My thoughts and prayers remain with the families and loved ones of these fallen officers who died in the line of duty and our recovering officers,"" RCMP Assistant Commissioner Roger Brown said in a statement on Friday. He identified the slain officers: . -- Constable David Joseph Ross, 32, of Victoriaville, Quebec, joined the RCMP in Ottawa. After graduating from the training academy in July 2007, he began working in general duty policing in New Brunswick's Codiac Detachment. -- Constable Douglas James Larche, 40, of Saint John's, New Brunswick, joined the RCMP in Moncton. He finished training in February 2002 and served in two posts before joining the Codiac Detachment where he worked in highway patrol and general duty policing. -- Constable Fabrice Georges Gevaudan, 45, of Boulogne-Billancourt, France, joined the RCMP in Regina, Saskatchewan. He graduated from training in February 2008 and worked in general duty policing in the Codiac Detachment. The injured officers are Constables Eric Stephane J. Dubois and Marie Darlene Goguen, who are ""recovering well and are to be commended,"" Brown said. The assistant commissioner said he would provide more details on the slain officers and their funeral arrangements in coming days. The only other information he provided about the constables was that one of them had three children and that Larche received a commander's commendation in 2008 for saving the life of an unconscious baby in Moncton. Ross was a police dog trainer and was married to Rachael Ross, who was pregnant with their second child, CNN affiliate CBC News reported. The couple already had a 19-month-old son. ""This is the most horrifying, difficult experience,"" Rachael Ross' mother told CBC. The couple celebrated an anniversary last month, and several of Rachael's friends on Facebook posted birthday wishes on her wall in May. Rachael Ross' sister-in-law told the National Post that Rachael got home from work Wednesday, the garage door was open and the barbecue had been left on. Her husband had been called in to work and left hastily, she told the newspaper. ""All these guys were family men, protectors of our society, great guys â€” and Dave was one of a kind,"" Raquel Vander Ploeg said. ""Dave loved his job. He was good at his job.

"(LifeWire)  -- Misti Guertin was a publicist with a full roster of clients and a growing salary when her husband, Gary, 56, was offered a job managing a luxury resort on a private island in the Caribbean. ""It takes some heartfelt conversations to begin balancing the career scales in a marriage,"" says an expert. ""My career was just beginning to bloom,"" says the Stuart, Florida, resident, ""but we both placed more emphasis on Gary's career."" Misti, 47, was raised to believe that the man's career comes first. So she went, taking a token title as co-manager of the resort. But less than a year after their arrival in 2005, a fire ravaged the resort and Gary's contract was terminated. ""The strain on our relationship was sizable,"" she says. The couple returned to Florida, where Misti went back to work as a publicist and Gary as the general manager of a yacht club and marina. Her income this year, she says, will exceed Gary's. It's common for couples to place more emphasis on the man's career, according to a 2007 study of more than 9,000 married men and women ages 25-59. The researchers, from the University of Iowa and the University of California-Davis, also found that when couples relocate, the husband tends to get a salary boost -- $3,000 on average. But the wife loses $750. ""When couples migrate, they are [typically] doing it for the benefit of the husband's career, and so the wife is what we call the 'trailing spouse,'"" says study author Mary Noonan, associate professor of sociology at the University of Iowa. ""She may have to take a job in the new location that is a less-than-ideal match for her skills [or] qualifications."" Expert: 'Things are moving slowly in the right direction' Why do couples, even today, let the woman's job take a back seat? Blame it on socialization, says Noonan. While it may not be true for every relationship, more often than not, she says, ""men and women are taught to play very different roles within marriage. Women are socialized to play a homemaking role within the family, whereas men are encouraged to focus on their careers and breadwinning.""  See how one dad has taken on child-rearing duties » . Daniel Buccino, a psychotherapist and faculty member at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, agrees. ""Until more men are willing to say, 'You know, honey, you shouldn't have to change your name or sacrifice your career, and I'll stay home with our kids and aging parents,' progress will remain glacial,"" he says. ""But things are moving slowly in the right direction."" After Dayna Steele, 48, published her first book in March and began making the media rounds, she found herself dealing with subtle power plays at home. ""I have tried very hard to schedule around my husband's full-time job and keep him posted on my schedule, confirming dates before I book them,"" says Steele, a former radio host living in Seabrook, Texas. ""Then, he started scheduling things over mine without telling me. ""It turned into a battle when I first tried to point out to him what he was doing -- trivializing my new career after promising to support it because he had a 'more important' job."" Steele knows her husband's salary and benefits are important but says her career deserves respect, too. ""We're not quite all the way there, but we're making some progress,"" she says. Steele's husband, Charles Justiz, 55, a NASA research pilot, says he does his best to show he values his wife's career, but it can be challenging, especially with two children.

But they're both working on being more flexible, he says. ""I love my wife, and the old saying is true: 'If Mama ain't happy, ain't nobody happy.'"" 'Balancing career scales' Experts have some tips for couples clashing over a career move: . Trade places. ""It takes some heartfelt conversations to begin balancing the career scales in a marriage,"" says Les Parrott, a clinical psychologist and faculty member at Seattle Pacific University. ""It requires both spouses to be honest with their feelings."" Parrott asks clients to list what's important to them about their careers, assigning each element a value from 1 to 10. After each spouse makes a list, they try to guess how much their partner values each item. ""It's almost always an eye-opener,"" says Parrott. ""It helps them empathize. It helps them trade places. And with that new perspective, they are ready for a more honest and grace-filled exploration of their options together."" Try the ""package deal"" approach. When a couple is considering relocating, Buccino says, one spouse should see what the new company can do for the other. Switch off. Buccino says the fluidity of today's job market gives couples ""opportunities to evaluate and re-evaluate and hopefully switch off between whose career takes priority at various phases along the marital life cycle."" When neither is willing to budge, there's always the long-distance marriage. ""I have seen two-career couples that live in two different cities,"" Buccino says, ""because neither is willing to pass up great career opportunities."" While such an arrangement may be a good interim move, it can take a toll on the relationship. ""Some couples have not made it,"" Buccino says. ""If they're committed to each other and the relationship, and otherwise so busy with work when apart, then it can work. But I'm not sure I'd recommend it as a first choice.""

"(CNN) -- If you often order a bloody Mary or tomato juice on a plane, yet rarely order them elsewhere, science may have just explained your bizarre in-flight urge. A bloody Mary could be one of the few drinks that actually tastes as it's supposed to in the air, according to the authors of a paper in the online journal Flavour, entitled ""Airplane noise and the taste of umami."" Previous studies have shown that loud noises, such as an aircraft engine, can reduce our ability to taste flavors by up to 30%. ""Umami, however, is immune to this effect,"" authors Charles Spence, Charles Michel and Barry Smith write. ""There is even some evidence to suggest that it ... may actually boost some of the other basic tastes."" Umami has been called ""the fifth taste,"" after salty, bitter, sweet and sour, and has been likened to a ""savory"" flavor. Umami effect . Spence et al suggest this might explain the popularity of tomato-based drinks on flights. ""A key feature of tomatoes is that they are rich in umami ... perhaps all those travelers who order a bloody Mary after the seatbelt sign has been turned off have figured out intuitively what scientists are only now slowly coming to recognize empirically."" They also say this could help chefs and diners plan their meals. ""One might also want to recommend an umami-rich menu -- that is, foods such as Parmesan cheese, tomatoes, and mushrooms -- to all those vocal restaurant critics out there, especially it seems in North America, who have been complaining that the background noise in many restaurants is simply too loud nowadays."" But don't forsake water for bloody Mary marathons just yet. The authors say more work is required to confirm their hypothesis.","Aircraft engine noises have been shown to impair taste reception by up to 30% .

"United Nations (CNN) -- U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon exhorted member nations Monday not to waver from efforts to meet the Millennium Development Goals they set for themselves a decade ago with a deadline of 2015. ""We have led you to the river, so what are we asking of you today?"" he said to a U.N. summit on global goals to fight poverty, hunger and disease. ""To stay true, true to our identity as an international community built on a foundation of solidarity, true to our commitment to end the dehumanizing conditions of extreme poverty."" The eight goals call for halving extreme poverty and hunger and achieving full employment; achieving universal primary education; promoting gender equality and empowering women; reducing child mortality by two thirds; reducing maternal mortality by three quarters and achieving universal access to reproductive health; beginning to reverse the spread of HIV; ensuring environmental stability; and developing a global partnership for development that deals with developing countries' debt. In a report issued before Monday's meeting, Ban said the summit is ""crucially important"" for meeting the anti-poverty goals. Progress reaching the targets has been uneven, he said, and several of the goals are likely to be missed in many countries if additional efforts are not made. The United Nations said almost 150 heads of state were expected to attend the meeting, which comes as many donor countries are tightening purse-strings in the wake of large fiscal deficits, rising debts and the global economic crisis. ""But economic uncertainty cannot be an excuse for slowing down our development efforts,"" Ban said in the report. French President Nicolas Sarkozy proposed levying a tax on transactions through the world banking system and applying those funds to efforts to meet the goals. ""Why should we not as finance -- money -- to participate in stabilizing the world by being involved in imposing on each financial transaction a small tax?"" he asked. Bolivian President Evo Morales blamed the transfer of natural resources from southern countries to those in the north for the world's economic imbalance. ""What we should discuss at this meeting, dear presidents, heads of state and heads of delegations, is how to put an end to this pillage of resources from the south,"" he said. He called for the nationalization of natural resources ""so the dividends they generate will remain in our countries and benefit our peoples."" He added, ""We need investors, but they cannot become owners of our natural resources. The state must be the owner of these natural resources."" Morales also called for the establishment of a bank for developing countries in the southern hemisphere, including those in Africa and Asia. The bank, if funded with a percentage of the countries' international reserves, could help the countries ""break away from our dependency on the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank,"" he said. During the four years he has served as president, the break with the IMF and the World Bank has helped Bolivia, he said. ""Without the IMF, we're better off than we were before,"" he said, citing eradication of illiteracy, a drop in extreme poverty from 41 percent to 32 percent and a 42 percent drop in infant mortality. But Bolivia will not be able to meet the millennium goals unless the distribution of wealth is made more equal, he said, noting that a recent U.N. report says that the poorest 40 percent of the world's population has only 5 percent of global income, while 70 percent of world income goes to the top 5 percent of the world's population. ""That is unfair distribution of wealth,"" he said. ""Our task should be oriented toward putting an end to this unfair distribution."" Israeli President Shimon Peres called again for a two-state solution in the Middle East -- a Jewish state and an Arab state. ""There is no other peaceful alternative to that conflict, and I believe we shall succeed, despite the differences,"" he said. He also espoused the world body's millennium goals. ""A hungry world will never be peaceful; a terrorized world will never be governable,"" he said. Jordan's King Abdullah II said his country has already achieved one of the goals -- ensuring that children in primary school stay in school, thereby ending youth illiteracy. But lack of regional peace represents a burden on development, he said. ""When warfare and violence divert resources from social needs and economic growth, economies and community life are undermined and poverty and frustration grow."" He expressed hope that the development programs ""can help build a foundation for peace."" The meeting to discuss Millennium Development Goals is a major item in a week that will include high-level discussions among international leaders as the U.N. General Assembly annual debate begins Thursday. U.N. officials are urging leaders to use the meetings as an opportunity to ratify dozens of international treaties ranging from protecting human rights to fighting terrorism to preserving biodiversity, a statement released by the organization said. Last year, 64 countries took 103 treaty actions, the highest participation in four years, according to the United Nations.","The Millennium Development Goals include halving extreme poverty by 2015 .

"(CNN) -- A House subcommittee is expected to grill Department of Homeland Security officials about concerns that violence in Mexico may spill over the border into the United States. Mexican federal police patrol last week on the streets of Ciudad Juarez, just across the border from El Paso, Texas. Mexico's military and police have been embroiled in increasingly violent clashes with drug cartels, which are battling among themselves for control over an ever-growing market in the United States. Rep. Loretta Sanchez, chairwoman of the House committee holding the hearing, said Thursday that what's happening in Mexico is becoming a growing problem for the United States. ""Well, it certainly has always been a problem at the border, but in the last couple of decades, it's gotten even worse. Now we see some spillover, just a little bit, coming into the United States,"" she said on CNN's ""American Morning."" ""I think it's time that we make a comprehensive plan to figure out, not just what we do about the violence at the border -- but it's all tied together with the economy down there, with our economy, ... commerce routes between the two countries."" The Border, Maritime and Global Counterterrorism Committee hearing on border issues focuses on violence and the transfer of guns from the United States to Mexico to arm the cartels. Sanchez said it's a crime to sell some of the guns from stores within the United States and traffic them to Mexico. Most of the gun stores selling these weapons, she said, are within a mile of the U.S.-Mexico border. Sanchez suggested looking at what types of guns are being sold in those stores and perhaps instituting some provision against assault weapons. On Wednesday, Vice President Joe Biden talked about drug-related violence in Mexico. ""Since the beginning of last year, there have been nearly 7,000 drug-related murders in Mexico. If we had said that years ago, we would have looked at each other like we were crazy,"" he said. ""Violent drug trafficking organizations are threatening both the United States and Mexican communities."" Biden made those remarks as he announced the nomination of Gil Kerlikowske as the new White House drug czar, a position that plays a key role in developing and implementing the Southwest border strategy. Last year, more than 1,600 killings occurred in Juarez, three times more than the most murderous city in the United States. And last month, the city's chief of police was obliged to quit after threats from organized crime to kill a policeman every day that he remained on the job. On Tuesday, five human heads were found in ice chests in the central Mexican state of Jalisco, police said. Growing drug violence has made beheadings in Tijuana, Juarez and other Mexican towns more commonplace over the past year. In recent weeks, the United States, Canada, France, Italy and Germany have issued alerts about travel to Mexico. ""The situation in Ciudad Juarez is of special concern,"" the State Department said in an alert last month. ""Mexican authorities report that more than 1,800 people have been killed in the city since January 2008. Additionally, this city of 1.6 million people experienced more than 17,000 car thefts and 1,650 carjackings in 2008."" Obama on Wednesday told regional newspaper reporters that he would consider sending the National Guard to the border if the situation escalated. ""We're going to examine whether and if National Guard deployments would make sense and under what circumstances they would make sense,"" Obama said, according to McClatchy Newspapers. ""I don't have a particular tipping point in mind,"" he told the reporters. ""I think it's unacceptable if you've got drug gangs crossing our borders and killing U.S. citizens."" The president said he did not have any interest in ""militarizing the border."" ""We expect to have a comprehensive approach to dealing with these issues of border security that will involve supporting [Mexico President Felipe] Calderon and his efforts,"" Obama said, according to McClatchy. ""Our expectation is to have a comprehensive policy in place in the next few months."" Obama and Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Adm. Michael Mullen on Saturday discussed how the U.S. military can assist Mexico in addressing growing violence from drug cartels, according to a military official. The president expressed interest in military capabilities that the U.S. has that could help Mexican forces, including intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance technology, the official said. CNN's Ismael Estrada, Kristi Keck, Rey Rodriguez and Barbara Starr contributed to this report.","Mexican officials embroiled in increasingly violent clashes with drug cartels .

"(CNN) -- Why did I fall in love with superheroes? For me, it was all about the masks. You see, growing up in the '70s, I learned early on that expecting to see someone who looked like me in a heroic role on TV or in the movies was like waiting for a unicorn to wander into our living room. When Asians did show up, it was usually in thankless, forgettable roles as nameless henchmen or comic relief: mules and donkeys, not unicorns. Which is why I turned to the world of comics. The bigger-than-life icons who fought for truth, justice and the American way in comic books often donned cowls, helmets and hoods to hide their identities to protect their loved ones from the vengeance of their diabolical nemeses. But their masks also allowed me to imagine myself (or someone very like me) beneath the Lycra Spandex. While I never quite felt authentic pretending to be James Bond, agent 007, or Steve Austin, the Six Million Dollar Man, a few tiny tweaks were all it took to become Batman or Spider-Man. All I had to do was re-envision Bruce Wayne as Bruce Wang, Peter Parker as Peter Park. The rest of their stories readily fell in line: Child of a doctor? Check. Nerdy science student? Check. Masks made the magic possible. When the masks came off, however, the fantasy ended. Batman was revealed as a billionaire WASP playboy, and Spider-Man a working-class Irish-American from Forest Hills, both with sparkling blue eyes. And that's why I'm holding off on getting too excited over Marvel's recent announcements that Captain America will pass his shield and red, white and blue tights on to his African-American friend and partner Sam Wilson, and Thor, God of Thunder, will turn his winged helmet, his mighty hammer Mjolnir and his divine powers over to an as-yet-unnamed woman. Costumes are just clothes. In the world of comics, they get passed around like the sniffles at a kindergarten. Don't get me wrong. It's great to see the comics make an effort at diversifying the halls of justice. A look at any toy aisle or movie marquee is all you need to see the degree to which superheroes have moved to the very center of our pop culture. Maybe that's because, as celebrated graphic novelist Gene Luen Yang says, ""Superheroes are quintessentially American. They were created in America, they're most popular in America, and in many ways, they embody American ideals. That's why we want diverse heroes: because we want to affirm that anyone can be an American."" But just swapping costumes doesn't quite do that — not in a permanent way, anyway. ""The problem with nonwhite characters taking over the legacies of established white characters is that the changes never seem to stick,"" says Yang. ""The Asian-American Atom got a sword in his belly. The African-American Goliath got lightning-bolted through the heart. The Asian-American Wasp got eaten by a supervillain. And the African-American Green Lantern simply receded to the background when it came time to make a major motion picture. The costume almost always reverts back to the original wearer."" And when the costumes go away, the secret identities beneath them remain. Cartoonist Vishavjit Singh saw this firsthand when he decided to go out in public in a Captain America costume, modified to accommodate his Sikh turban and beard, testing Yang's premise that ""anyone can be American."" ""The transformation of how people saw and responded to me was startling,"" says Singh. ""Americans and tourists alike were turning heads, breaking out into smiles, offering high fives and warm words of support. But as soon as I got out of the costume, I encountered stereotypical epithets about my turban and beard."" The fact is, the only way to really make the superhero universe look like America (and by extension, the world) is to create fresh, new heroes who represent us in all our vibrant diversity, with origin stories that are authentic to their identities. In the graphic novel collections, ""Secret Identities"" and ""Shattered,"" my co-editors and I challenged Asian-American comic creators to pen original tales of Asian-American superheroes who were Asian-American from the very beginning. This was just a small step in the right direction. Because when you create new heroes, they don't have the weight of history behind them. Superman boosted spirits in the wake of the Great Depression and fought Nazis in World War II. He's woven into our nation's fabric. It takes the passage of time for a hero to achieve cultural capital, something that will take decades for modern heroes-come-lately. Fortunately, it turns out an Asian-American superhero of Golden Age vintage actually exists. Back in the early 1940s, one of the few Asian-Americans working in comics was Chu F. Hing, who invented the Green Turtle — a character he reportedly conceived of as Chinese-American. However, with ""yellow peril"" fears rampant in the years after World War II, Chu was forbidden by his editors to reveal that the Turtle was Asian. In defiance, Chu never drew his Turtle out of costume, and the character quickly fell into obscurity. Now, the Turtle is back. Gene Yang and collaborator Sonny Liew, in a new graphic novel called ""The Shadow Hero,"" are giving him a fresh origin story that shows his rise from Chinatown grocery store stock boy to invincible Chinese-American crime buster — under the watchful tutelage of his cranky uncle and overprotective mom. In doing so, they've brought this original Asian-American superhero to the attention of a new era. This means that for my kids and future generations, there might finally be a masked marvel they can legitimately call their own — one whose origins are deeply rooted in our nation's past, yet whose features reflect the ones they see when they look in the mirror. To me, that would be super.","Marvel is creating an African-American Captain America and a female Thor .

"(CNN) -- Manchester United needs a miracle to win the league title this year according to manager Louis van Gaal -- so what better way to start off than with the arrival of an angel. Angel Di Maria, the Argentina winger, completed his £59.7 million ($98.7m) move -- a British transfer record -- from Real Madrid Tuesday on a five-year deal, the club announced on its official website. ""I am absolutely delighted to be joining Manchester United. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time in Spain and there were a lot of clubs interested in me, but United is the only club that I would have left Real Madrid for,"" said Di Maria. ""Angel is a world-class midfielder but most importantly he is a team player. There is no doubting his immense natural talent,"" Van Gaal said after clinching the signing. ""He is an excellent addition to the team."" But on the day the 26-year-old arrived at Old Trafford, the club suffered an embarrassing exit from the English League Cup at MK Dons -- thrashed 4-0 by the third flight side. Goals from Will Grigg in either half and a late double from Benik Afobe saw an admittedly understrength United team humiliated. The shock defeat comes after United failed to win either of its two Premier League games following a home defeat by Swansea and a draw at Sunderland. The arrival of Di Maria is something of a coup for a club without the lure of Champions League football given the Argentine was recently described by his fellow countryman and Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone as Real Madrid's ""best player."" He also starred for Argentina in its run to the World Cup final in Brazil, but missed the semifinal win over Van Gaal's Netherlands and the final defeat to Germany due to a thigh injury. However there are reservations over whether United should have used the money to improve other areas of the squad. ""I think he himself is an excellent signing,"" Miguel Delaney, football writer for the Independent and the Blizzard told CNN. ""It remains staggering that Real are selling him, given he tied their formation together last season -- but it sums up so much of the current United that a signing like that can still leave so many questions. ""He is now the club's primary signing, yet it hasn't addressed the two primary issues with the squad -- central defense and central midfield. ""At the very least, he offers pace, and trickery, and will give the side some of the thrust it lacked against Sunderland. ""But United also needs players further back to offer that platform. It's difficult to have any quibbles with the signing of Di Maria. You can, however, have quibbles with signing him without purchasing more necessary players."" United endured a disastrous time last season as David Moyes, the man who replaced Alex Ferguson, was sacked just 10 months after taking over at Old Trafford. The club finished seventh in the Premier League and missed out on qualifying for the Champions League for the first time since 1995. Ryan Giggs took over the reins following Moyes' exit in April before van Gaal was appointed in July. United have brought in midfielder Ander Herrera from Athletic Bilbao, teenager Luke Shaw from Southampton and defender Marcos Rojo from Sporting Lisbon. But Di Maria is the marquee signing -- the winger who played such a key role for Argentina in the World Cup and Real Madrid's Champions League triumph. Real paid around $60 million for Di Maria in 2010 following the player's successful time with Benfica in Portuguese football where he won the league title and the domestic cup on two occasions. During his time in the Spanish capital, Di Maria became an important part of the side which won the Spanish league title in 2012. He was also a key member of the team which won ""La Decima"" -- Real's 10th European Cup triumph with a dramatic victory over Atletico Madrid in the 2014 final. But his chances of first team football with Carlo Ancelotti's side have been limited since the arrival of James Rodriguez. The Colombian, one of the stars of the World Cup in Brazil, joined the club last month in a deal worth a reported $121 million. Real also completed the $34 million signing of Germany World Cup winner Toni Kroos in July as it bolstered its midfield options. Di Maria will hope to make his United debut against Burnley on Saturday at Turf Moor, with Van Gaal hoping his team can hit back after its sorry start to the season. The previous British transfer record was set by Chelsea in 2011 when they paid £50 million ($83m) to sign Fernando Torres from Liverpool.","Manchester United has completed the signing of Angel Di Maria .

"(CNN) -- The student debt fight is back -- with a vengeance. Once again, current students are facing the possibility of interest rates on Stafford Federal student loans doubling. Once again, we are asking what our leaders are doing about a crisis that gets worse every year. Once again, the answer is: Not much. That is a huge problem -- and not just for millennials, or young people born between 1980 and 2000. The approximately $1.1 trillion in student debt out there already constitutes a crisis for every one of us. It is the only form of household debt that has continued to rise during the Great Recession. It is also the only form of debt that cannot be discharged under bankruptcy or even death, as parents who have lost children have discovered to their horror. It is preventing young people from buying homes and starting businesses. In short, student debt is a $1.1 trillion anvil dragging down the entire U.S. economy. Unfortunately, the conversation in Washington is not about big fixes, but simply how to avoid making matters worse by letting interest rates rise. Last year, the interest rate on federal Stafford student loans was set to double from 3.4% to 6.8%. There was a massive outcry from students and organizations like my own, Rebuild the Dream. Perhaps fearing young people's electoral clout, Congress kicked the can down the road a year. So here we go again: Last week, President Obama waded back into fight, urging Congress to prevent the rate hike scheduled for July 1. But this year, something is different: Sen. Elizabeth Warren. A few weeks ago, Warren, D-Massachusetts, proposed groundbreaking legislation that would give students the same deal that big Wall Street banks get. This bill is good policy, and even better politics. After all, why are we loaning money to mega-profitable international financial institutions at 0.75%, but demanding up to nine times more from our own young people? By comparison, the otherwise ideal Harkin-Reid proposal for a two-year extension of the current 3.4% rate is simply not as ambitious. Unfortunately, the proposals with the most energy behind them are worse than both these options. House Republicans, the Obama administration, and a number of senators are all pushing to permanently tie the rate for student loans to the government's borrowing costs. It may seem commonsense, but the devil is in the details. For instance, the Republican plan passed recently is just plain bad for students. Interest rates on July 1 would actually be higher than 6.8% for some borrowers, and vary wildly and unpredictably over the lifetime of the loan. The government would mark up the costs 2.5% to 4.5%, based on the type of loan. The profit would pay down a deficit young people did not create, instead of funding education. The Obama plan, by contrast, has better terms for borrowers and would offer fixed-rate loans that will not suddenly spike in cost. But it lacks any cap on how high interest rates can go, and continues the worrying practice of the government profiting off student loans. As for borrowers who already have loans? Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, has proposed allowing students to simply refinance their old loans at today's historically low rates. It is almost shocking that you cannot do this already. California Democratic Rep. Karen Bass' Student Loan Fairness Act would make repayment fairer and easier. Young people should be rallying behind the Warren, Bass, and Gillibrand bills. But they can and should demand a whole lot more. The problem is not just that the cost of borrowing could go up. The real problem is the skyrocketing cost of tuition that is forcing students to take on unmanageable levels of debt in the first place. It is in our leaders' own best interests to do something about that. After all, millennials will make up one-third of eligible voters in 2020. It is no accident that the two best Senate bills were introduced by senators -- Warren and Gillibrand -- who have been rumored as future presidential candidates. But at the end of the day, this is not a student issue. It is not a youth issue. This is a corrosive crisis that touches your life whether you know it or not. If you live in the United States of America, this is your issue. The student debt fight is back -- and it is not going away any time soon. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Van Jones.","Interest rates on Stafford Loans issued after July 1 are set to double to 6.8% .

"Chicago (CNN) -- Prosecutors said Tuesday the career criminal accused of killing a 6-month-old Chicago girl admitted to other people that he shot into the van where Jonylah Watkins was sitting on her father's lap in March. Before Koman Willis' bond hearing was postponed until June 6, Assistant State's Attorney Heather Kent said his cell phone and his girlfriend's minivan could be traced to the area at the time of the killing through phone records and surveillance video. She claimed there was at least one unidentified witness who stepped forward and said that Willis admitted to the March 11 shooting. According to court documents, Willis saw Jonathan Watkins, Jonylah's father. Suspecting that Watkins had stolen a Sony PlayStation system and drugs from the home of his mother, Willis went to get a gun, the documents say. Willis drove a van to the alley where Watkins was parked and changing Jonylah's diaper; he walked up behind the van and fired four shots, the documents say. Prosecutors say Willis began firing as Watkins lifted his baby up to give her a kiss. Jonylah, whose death was held up nationally as a new low in Chicago's gun violence, passed away the next day. After the shooting, Willis parked the van in a garage and removed the plates. Lawyers ask for more time . On Tuesday, his lawyers said they needed more time to prepare their case. Willis, 33, is charged with first-degree murder and aggravated battery with a firearm. In announcing Willis' arrest on Monday, Chicago police superintendent Garry McCarthy said the suspect is a gang member with 38 prior arrests. Kent said Tuesday that Willis' extensive criminal record includes a 2002 arrest for aggravated assault to a police officer for which he served a three-year prison sentence. He also had been charged several times for felony drug possession. Willis turned himself in Saturday afternoon. He came in with an attorney because he knew police were looking for him, McCarthy said. The superintendent said this was not a case of gang violence even though the suspect and the victim's father have ties to gangs. ""We believe the motivation was the burglary,"" he said. He said it was unlikely Watkins, 29, will be charged with theft. Lead investigator Kevin Duffin said police were able to identify new witnesses last week. ""They provided some key information that got the ball rolling,"" he said. No weapon or getaway van has been recovered, police said. McCarthy said ""we're still not at that point"" to say that Willis acted alone, but no other charges are expected soon. Chicago mourns 6-month-old 'angel' killed in shooting . Father says he has become a new man . Jonathan Watkins, who was seriously wounded in the shooting, told reporters Tuesday, that he has changed his life since his daughter died. He said he goes to church now and has a real job. ""I don't stand on the corners no more,"" he said. ""I'm just a whole different person now."" He said he won't go back to a life of crime. ""I know my baby out there is looking down on me,"" he said. ""I can't change (and go back to selling drugs)."" He said he had never met Willis but refused to answer any other questions about the case. ""I feel better that somebody's been caught,"" he said. Despite police assertions that he was a gang member, Watkins said he hasn't be in a gang since he was a teenager. When pressed about the burglary of the video game system, he turned to Pastor Corey Brooks, who said Willis' trial would be the time for the details to be revealed. ""But we can assure you that there is more to it than what's being said,"" said Brooks, the pastor of New Beginnings Church of Chicago. He added that he has taken Watkins under his wing to make sure he doesn't return to a life where crime is the only means he has of supporting himself. Chicago baby shot while dad changes diaper .

"(CNN) -- For the first time in his life, Joe Fulce gets up at 5 a.m. to do something other than play basketball. The former Marquette University forward has played since kindergarten, but major knee surgery ended the highly recruited player's NBA dreams. He still gets choked up talking about it. ""You just get used to always practicing and being with the guys,"" Fulce said. ""When you get in that type of injury situation when you're trying to make it, well, I just can't talk about it yet."" What Fulce does talk about with great enthusiasm is the college degree he earned in December. It was exactly what he needed to land his first job. It was the first thing they asked about when he interviewed at Digital Intelligence Systems in Dallas, Texas. When he got the job, he immediately sent a grateful text to Marquette Assistant Athletics Director Adrienne Ridgeway. ""Joe Fulce sent me a text saying, 'Hey, thanks for looking out for me. You were right. I did need this degree,'"" Ridgeway said. ""I told him, 'See, that's exactly the message we've been trying you to get this entire time. You finally got it.'"" Secretary of Education Arne Duncan wants to see a lot more happy academic advisers because the reality is, a lot of players who do exceptionally well on the court struggle outside of the spotlight. Men's NCAA Division 1 basketball players have one of the worst graduation rates in college sports, according to a study by the Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport. More than a dozen schools didn't graduate at least half their players in recent seasons, according to the study, which looked at how many players completed their degrees in six years. For instance, the University of Connecticut graduates 25% of its players; the University of Florida graduates 38%, Michigan 45%, and at Indiana it was 47%. Those figures exclude star players who leave school early to play in the NBA. Few make it to the next level . That's a real problem. On average, only about 1% of college players go pro and only a small percentage more get a job playing overseas. To even coach the game they know so well, players need to get a degree. Duncan, a co-captain at Harvard in the mid-1980s, said he played ball growing up on the streets of Chicago with far too many guys who didn't graduate. Those guys, he says, were really lost after basketball ended. ""There were all these amazing stars who generated lots of money for the universities they played for and had nothing, zero, to show for it after the season,"" Duncan said. ""I always felt that was morally wrong."" Duncan decided to do something about it. Using his bully pulpit as education secretary, he went on TV programs, held news conferences and wrote editorials suggesting teams that fail to graduate at least 40% of their players should be banned from postseason tournaments. ""To have an advocate like Secretary Duncan is a good kind of push,"" said NCAA president Mark Emmert. ""It was moving in that direction anyway, and we were able to accelerate it."" Last fall the NCAA voted on a postseason ban for teams that don't graduate about 50% of their players four years in a row. That means last year's men's national champions, the University of Connecticut, will be banned from the 2013 tournament no matter how well they play next season. ""I think it's the culture around college basketball,"" Emmert said. ""We've got a society that teaches young men in particular that if you can play ball, dribble, focus on that. That will get you into college. That will get you into the NBA. ""But now we need to say that's important, but it doesn't work unless you have school work alongside it and are prepared to be a college student."" Lost sight of the goal . Former UConn center Jonathan Mandeldove said he probably did go about college all the wrong way. ""I know when I was a student, I looked too far ahead at the glitz and stars and glamour of the NBA instead of taking it one step at a time with school,"" he said. While he knew his place on the court, even early on he says he felt a little lost in the classroom. There were tutors and people at UConn to help him if he asked for it, but he says he struggles with ADD (attention-deficit disorder). ""I got into some grade trouble,"" he said. ""Staying up with the studies and staying up with the help while I was playing basketball ... it just didn't work out for me."" In 2009, Mandeldove said UConn asked him, as a senior, to ""take a break"" from his studies. He went home to Georgia three classes shy of graduation. While Mandeldove says he is still working out and still trying hard to make it to the NBA, until then he has had a hard time finding work without a degree. He's had to cobble together a variety of low paying basketball jobs: helping his dad coach an AAU team, running skills drills for his sister and her friends at an AAU camp and playing semi-pro ball for the Gwinnett Majic for about $75 a game. ""Everyone wants to go pro. We all chase those dreams,"" Duncan said. ""But the number of players who will make money playing basketball is minute. We always say, 'Chase that dream, but catch an education.'"" The long college basketball season is a grind, said one college official . ""They play over 30 games a season -- and that's even before the tournament from early November through March -- and it's incredible stress on any student,"" said Susan Herbst, who became president of UConn in August. When she got the job, Herbst said she knew she inherited a real academic problem with the basketball team. She immediately went to work getting services in place to help the struggling students and getting every adult who worked with the team on board with the academic mission. Now she even gets players' grades regularly sent to her so she can personally make sure they are on track to graduate. ""In the past, I think the general problem was lack of support,"" Herbst said. While Herbst agrees that teams need to take academics seriously, UConn appealed the postseason ban, but was denied by the NCAA. Herbst thinks the penalty is unfair, since the ban is based on past players' academic performance rather than that of the current team, which is decidedly better. ""For me as an educator, as a parent, to see our current students -- who are going to class and doing this kind of thing, who would be model student athletes in anybody's view -- to see them get punished for something students a few years ago failed to do is heartbreaking."" Marquette a model program . UConn would like to have the type of success they have at Marquette. They have had great academic and athletic success with its student-athletes. The perennial basketball powerhouse has graduated all of its players in some years. This year it's 91%. Rev. Scott Pilarz, the Catholic university's president, said the key to its success is the individualized attention it gives to players. That approach stems from the Jesuit tradition on which the school was founded. ""Part of who we are as a Jesuit university makes us insist that we care for these students from every point of the compass,"" Pilarz said. ""We have this tradition called cura personalis - which goes back to the 16th century and really is rooted in Ignatius Loyola's experience of how God treated him as a unique individual -- and that's how we want to treat all our students. We really try to stress meeting them where they are individually and then moving them along so they achieve well academically."" Fulce said like Mandeldove, he struggled with ADD and had a few other learning disabilities. Graduation for him was not a guarantee. ""I had to go to junior college to get my grades up, but when I got here they taught me how to do the best I could with the talents I have,"" Fulce said. When Marquette players are selected to play for the school, they immediately know academics will be emphasized when they get there. Even before they start their freshmen year, they attend mandatory summer school. That's where they can get used to college-level work and that's also where the athletics academic director can see where the players are academically. ""From that point, then we know how to approach the school year,"" Ridgeway said. ""We know then right off the bat if a player needs a tutor in math because that's not their strong point, and we can create an academic program that's just for them."" In Fulce's case, Ridgeway discovered he was a visual learner. So they helped him design a set of note cards for any class he took to help him study. ""When I got to my new job, I had to laugh because there on everyone's desk to help them with their sales calls were note cards! I'm like, 'Damn, everyone is using note cards. I know what to do with those.'"" Fulce said he built up exactly the right study habits to succeed. ""I learned it's like making free throws. All kids need consistent repetition to learn. Everything is repetition,"" he said. It also meant being constantly watched by his academic advisors. Players must swipe in and swipe out of study hall with a card that keeps track of how long they're in there. Computer programs monitor their class attendance and grades. Tutors fly with the team to away games and chartered planes rush them back to campus in time for class. Fulce said the academic team also has spies everywhere. ""I know they'd even ask the people who delivered the papers to the academic center if they've seen us and how long we've been there,"" he said, laughing. ""They really stayed on me about my class work because they cared. And, well, I felt like I had to give into them at some point.""","The NCAA penalizes schools with low academic achievement rates .

"(CNN) -- Time is running out for a British grandmother facing execution for drug trafficking in Indonesia, after her second appeal was rejected.

Sandiford, from northeast England, was found to have blocks of cocaine weighing 4.7 kilograms (10.4 pounds) in her suitcase when she arrived on the island on a Thai Airways flight, the court heard during her original trial. She received the death sentence despite the fact prosecutors only requested a 15-year prison term. A subsequent appeal against the sentence handed down by Denpasar District Court was thrown out by the Denpasar High Court in April -- a decision that has now been upheld by the country's Supreme Court, according to the official Antara news agency. ""Her appeal was rejected,"" presiding Judge Artidjo Alkostar said late Thursday, according to Antara. Three other defendants in the case received jail sentences of six years, four years and a year respectively. Cooperation . A lawyer representing Sandiford expressed disappointment at the decision. ""We're very disappointed by the Supreme Court's rejection of her appeal. Lindsay was only a courier and a collaborator and cooperated with the police,"" Fadillah Agus told CNN Friday. ""They were able to arrest the other suspects with her help so she should've gotten the lightest sentence,"" he added. ""The other suspects got off with lighter sentences. We are disappointed but we have to honor the court's decision. ""We have two options, a judicial review or seeking clemency from the president. But I have to discuss this first with Lindsay and see what step we should take."" He revealed he last spoke to Sandiford, who remains in prison in Bali, over a month ago. According to Agus, she was keeping herself busy and socializing more with other inmates and prison officials. Britain's Foreign and Commonwealth Office, meanwhile, is seeking confirmation of the decision. ""We are aware of unconfirmed reports that the decision of the Indonesian Supreme Court has been announced. We are seeking confirmation of the decision from the Indonesian Supreme Court,"" a Foreign Office spokesman told Britain's Press Association. ""We will continue to provide consular assistance to Lindsay Sandiford and her family at this difficult time."" Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation, has strict laws against drug trafficking. Severe punishment . The head of Bali's Customs and Excise Agency monitoring division, Made Wijaya, warned at the time of her arrest that Sandiford could likely face execution if convicted. ""The main reason is because narcotics can massively endanger the young and, thus, whoever is caught with drugs should be severely punished. If three people can consume one gram of cocaine, then this operation has potentially saved up to 14,000 lives,"" he said. Indonesia has carried out 22 executions since 1998 -- 14 for murder, 5 for narcotics crimes and 3 for terrorism, according to the Lowy Institute for International Policy. Five of the 22 people executed were foreigners; all five were executed for drugs crimes. According to Lowy, one plea for clemency has succeeded in a capital case since 1990, out of a total of at least 36 pleas. CNN's Kathy Quiano in Jakarta contributed to this report.","Supreme Court upholds death penalty against Sandiford for drug trafficking .

"(CNN) -- ""This is a big change, consumers don't always love change, and there's a lot of education we have to provide to make sure that people understand."" This is the extremely diplomatic way Microsoft Xbox Chief Marketing and Strategy Officer Yusuf Mehdi spun his reaction to the PR challenges surrounding the Xbox One of late. And it's true, consumers around the world (and around the Internet) loudly expressed how much they dislike the changes Microsoft announced to its game licensing terms (and online requirements) for the Xbox One last Thursday, giving Sony the ammunition it needed to win E3 by basically doing nothing. The reaction wasn't a surprise to Mehdi, though. In fact, he said a lot of the way people have responded to Microsoft's moves was ""kind of as we expected."" But the implication of his statements in an in-depth interview with Ars Technica was that this temporary confusion and discomfort among the audience would be worth it as gamers and consumers adjust to a console world without game discs. ""We're trying to do something pretty big in terms of moving the industry forward for console gaming into the digital world. We believe the digital world is the future, and we believe digital is better."" Mehdi made a comparison to the world of home movie viewing, where inconvenient trips to Blockbuster Video have been replaced with Netflix streaming on practically any device instantly. On Xbox One, having all games exist as cloud-connected downloads enables new features like being able to access your entire library at a friend's house with a single login, or loaning games to up to ten ""family members"" digitally and remotely. Those digital ""benefits"" will be available at launch, but Mehdi hinted that the digital rights management transition might unlock some more interesting game access and distribution methods later on. ""In the future, you can imagine the capability to have different licensing models, different ways that people have to access games. This all gets unlocked because of digital."" He wouldn't get drawn into details, but when I suggested ideas like an ""all-you-can-play"" Netflix for games or purely digital game rentals, he didn't shoot me down. ""Sure. It could be a variety of ways."" He also suggested that the transition to a world of strictly downloadable and online-connected games would help allow for ""a diversity of business models"" for publishers to take advantage of, from free-to-play titles to $60 AAA games to Xbox Live Arcade games somewhere in between. ""As you go into a digital world, what's happening is publishers are choosing to have different business models and consumers are saying 'Hey, if I can't resell the title, provide me a different way to get value to get into your game.' And we think the market will be efficient in finding good models that work for consumers."" In essence, Mehdi said, consumer demand for good value from games will drive prices down, even if a publisher decides to fully cut off the market release valve of used game resale. Publishers, of course, have been the most forceful proponents of cutting off the used game market, with some suggesting that used games are comparable to piracy for their bottom line. But Mehdi said that Microsoft wasn't simply ""giving in"" to publisher demands with its new game licensing terms. Instead, it was trying to balance the needs of its four main ""constituents,"" including the consumer (who comes ""first and foremost"" he said), game publishers, retailers, and Microsoft itself as a company. ""Within that, we've tried to optimize, and I think we've found a great balance across all of those dimensions,"" Mehdi said. ""But there are tradeoffs. ""We do want to support everyone in that system, beginning with the consumer. But we want publishers to get paid for the great IP they work on. We want retailers to be able to drive and sell our products and make a profit. So we are trying to balance across all those."" Mehdi noted that purely digital game marketplaces like the iOS App Store have thrived despite having absolutely no physical media. Implementing that kind of disc-free system on the Xbox One ""may not [have been] the best thing for consumers, and it may not [have been] the thing they [would have] wanted,"" Mehdi said, which is part of why Microsoft decided to keep discs as an option. Still, he did concede that, without discs, the licensing norms for the system ""would be easier to understand."" The way Mehdi talked about Microsoft's licensing decisions reinforced the idea that he saw the limited abilities to share and transfer Xbox One games as a step up from other, purely digital marketplaces, even if some others see it as a step down from current disc-based distribution systems. On the Xbox One, Mehdi said the company has ""tried to... bridge the two in a way that no one has done -- to give you the power of digital and then give you all this power in physical ... . We know we're providing a lot more value to consumers, but in that comes a lot of need to clarify, 'How come disc? How come digital? How's that work?'"" While the Internet is decidedly up in arms about the way the Xbox One handles game ownership and online check-ins, Mehdi said it was ""hard to say"" what the larger reaction from the less attentive mainstream consumers would be. ""I think it's fair to say there's a segment of consumers at this show in particular who really pay attention, who are very passionate about all aspects of gaming, and that we listen to closely. In a broader set of community, people don't pay attention to a lot of the details. We've seen it in the research, we've seen it in a lot of the data points."" One data point in particular Mehdi pointed to was the success of the initial pre-orders for the Xbox One, which started as soon as Microsoft's press conference concluded Monday. ""Amazon basically says they are on path to sell out ... . Amazon is saying it's one of their best-selling consumer products. We're seeing the same thing from other retailers."" To be fair, PlayStation 4 pre-orders were also a quick sell-out on Amazon after the company's press conference on Monday. Still, ""it's very clear there are a wide variety of other consumers that love to game that are excited about what we have to offer with Xbox One,"" Mehdi said. While the Xbox One will sell for $100 more than the PlayStation 4, Mehdi suggested that the extra money spent would be worthwhile to consumers looking for the best value in their next gaming system. Besides exclusive titles and gaming content, Mehdi said players would see value in the system being ""backed by 300,000 servers backed by Microsoft that enable incredible game experiences."" For another, the Kinect in each box provides for better gameplay and ""ease of use for the entire system."" Things like live TV support and exclusive NFL and Skype partnerships will also help show consumers the Xbox One's ""tremendous value."" ""We want to have our offering be differentiated relative to all others,"" he said. ""It has value that is in so many areas that is not in competing systems ... . That is a thing that each consumer will choose... and ultimately consumers will decide which is better. It's a big market."" This story originally appeared on ArsTechnica.

"(CNN) -- Here's a free idea that will make some businessperson millions of dollars. Go ahead and take it -- it's yours. You'll be doing a service to humankind. In addition to all the money you'll make, you may very well end up with the Nobel Peace Prize, with the thanks of a grateful world. This is no joke. The idea? Bring back phone booths. You're already saying: What? Phone booths? Who uses pay phones anymore? No one said anything about pay phones. The idea is to put up phone booths -- all right, technically, phoneless booths -- in public places around the country. The old-style phone booths, with doors that close, and ventilator fans in the ceilings. Either the ones made out of metal and glass that were seen on street corners for generations, or the elegant ones made out of dark wood and glass that were seen in the lobbies of office buildings and in the backs of drugstores. Phone booths were a wonderfully democratic invention, intended to shut out the noise of the immediate outside world so the person in the booth could privately, in silence, talk with someone miles away. Are you starting to see where we're going with this? The new phone booths wouldn't have pay telephones inside. But they would be the solution to one of society's most constantly irritating problems. You can't escape the yammering all around you -- the people walking down the street blabbing at high volume into their cell phones. The cell phones, of course, are the primary reason that pay telephones are increasingly hard to find. With so many people carrying their own phones, telephone companies have been deciding that it was uneconomical to maintain pay phones. And here is where the idea comes in. If there were clean, convenient, phone(less) booths readily available, don't you think that people would step into them to make their cell phone calls? Who wouldn't opt for privacy and quiet if it was there for them to take? A savvy entrepreneur could finance the project by selling advertising space both outside and -- especially -- inside the new phone booths, whether on the streets, in malls, restaurants -- anywhere that people gather. National advertisers would literally have a captive audience. The person in the booth would have no choice but to stare at the advertising. Cities and municipalities would love it, too. They could negotiate the rights to a percentage of the advertising fees for the booths on the streets, perhaps in exchange for having city workers help keep the booths clean. There is a business precedent for this: In some cities, private firms have erected shelters at bus stops, with advertising displayed on the walls. The bus riders don't object to seeing the ads while they wait -- they're just glad to be able to get out of the storm. The storm from which the new phone booths would provide relief is the storm of words that has overtaken public places. Advertisers face a vexing set of decisions these days because with so many media outlets -- hundreds of cable channels, millions of websites, consumers thumbing through screen after screen on their handheld devices -- it can be difficult to determine how best to reach potential customers. The new phone booths would be goldmines -- places guaranteed to deliver the advertising message to a person willingly enclosed inside. Sort of like the isolation booths on the old quiz shows. There would be challenges: The phone booths would have to be absolutely transparent on all four sides; otherwise people could set up housekeeping inside, could use the booths as private dining rooms, could have quick romantic encounters. But technology could make a virtue of that necessity. While people on the outside could look in, the person on the inside could be surrounded by advertising messages electronically delivered onto only one side -- the interior side -- of the window-walls. The trick would be to manufacture enough of the new booths. Once the first ones went up, people would want more. It's hard to even remember the days when phone booths were ubiquitous in America; well before the advent of cell phones, the four-walls-and-a-ceiling booths had largely been replaced by bolted-to-a-wall units that just featured pay phones without the benefit of much privacy. But that was in a different world, one in which people did not walk through life jabbering loudly into tiny phones. The one drawback to the new phone booths might be that the people who use them the most could turn out to be not cell phone callers trying to be courteous to their fellow pedestrians, but those beleaguered fellow pedestrians themselves, seeking to escape the rude babblers. Clark Kent used to duck into phone booths to change into his Superman uniform. Today, Superman himself might be tempted to duck into the new phone booths just to flee in abject annoyance from all the relentlessly loud yakkers outside. Even the Man of Steel has his breaking point. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: Bring back the once ubiquitous phone booth -- but for cell phone users .
He says it's common for people to talk in public on cell phones; a phone booth would offer quiet .
He says: Talkers could have privacy, advertisers a captive audience; demand would grow .

"Boulder, Colorado (CNN) -- Cloud cover, cooler temperatures and a little bit of rain assisted firefighters battling a wildfire west of Boulder, Colorado, authorities said Wednesday. Four people remained unaccounted for, authorities said at a late afternoon press conference. ""We can hope [weather factors] will be a positive influence on helping firefighters getting some more work done,"" said spokeswoman Laura McConnell of the Rocky Mountain Incident Management Team . Authorities initially had reports that 20 people were missing, said Sarah Huntley, a spokeswoman for Boulder's Office of Emergency Management. Sixteen of them were subsequently located. Of those still missing, some ""were people who did not evacuate,"" Boulder County Sheriff's Office Cmdr. Rick Brough said. Police were contacting their relatives and were also conducting welfare checks at their homes, Brough said. About 140 structures, which includes residences and other buildings, were destroyed, Brough said. Twenty-four were damaged. Officials said they had no containment information on the fire and did not yet know its cause. Some residents were concerned they couldn't check on their homes Wednesday, but Brough said it was too risky too allow travel into the area. ""We have active fire, he said. ""We can't let people up yet."" Officials have established an emergency shelter and victim assistance center. The list of damaged homes was posted online Tuesday night. The list will be added to as authorities continue to assess damage left by the blaze. ""These addresses were determined from only 5 to 10 percent of the burned area, as that is the only area that could be safely surveyed on Tuesday,"" the list said. An infrared flight allowed authorities to better map the fire, and its size has shrunk from the 7,100 acres reported earlier to 6,388 acres, said McConnell. Twenty-four engines and 300 firefighters were on scene Wednesday, and several aircraft were also being used to battle the blaze, she said. A community meeting is planned for Wednesday night, Brough said. Brough said Tuesday night that flames had spread throughout the Fourmile Canyon area west of the city. After an anxious day, evacuee Paul Gatza of Sunshine learned late Tuesday that his house had been spared. ""Fortunately, we just got visual confirmation ... that we're still standing for one more night, and [Wednesday] will be another new, long day,"" he said.  ""It's a matter of trying to gain little pieces of information from firefighters and firefighters' spouses, and whoever else we can get reliable news from."" Colorado Gov. Bill Ritter declared a state of emergency Tuesday as the size of the wildfire more than doubled. Ritter said the state was throwing $5 million into the battle to save homes and forests in the canyon. ""It is important right now for people who've been evacuated to just be patient,"" Ritter said after a tour of the area. ""This is a very volatile situation, it would be fair to say. There is a fire line. They are doing all they can to contain the fire line. At the same time, there are a fair number of embers that are also starting smaller fires."" Ritter said he saw ""entire hillsides"" burned by the flames, along with numerous structures. ""It's not safe for people to return to their homes, because as we drove up there, you go from a place that is relatively safe, and then suddenly, you'd see a spot fire burning on the side of the road,"" he said. Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle accompanied the governor on his tour of the area and said the fire had ""literally exhausted our local resources and management team."" ""But we have a good and healthy amount of people in place now learning everything they need to know about the fire,"" he said. The sheriff said Tuesday his department was investigating a report that the fire may have started when a car hit and ruptured a propane tank. ""That's the best information I have right now, but that's part of what that investigative team is doing for me today, is trying to lock all that down and confirm it,"" he said. Pelle said that authorities had evacuated 70 subdivisions and made nearly 8,000 notifications. No injuries have been reported. CNN's Ed Payne, Melanie Whitley, Georgette Knuckles and CNNRadio's Matt Cherry contributed to this report.","NEW: 140 structures destroyed, 24 damaged .

"(CNN) -- Kathleen Taylor was hanging lights on her house in Wimberley, Texas, the week before Thanksgiving in 1998. Reaching to put up a giant yellow star on the end of the eave, Taylor felt the ladder she was on start to wobble. Glancing down, she saw her 3-year-old daughter playing below. ""I just panicked,"" she says. Worried the ladder would fall on the toddler, Taylor jumped off, landing unnaturally on the front part of her left foot. The foot was swollen for days, and Taylor remembers hobbling around through the holidays, certain she had a hairline fracture. Taylor's story isn't unusual. In November and December 2010 (the latest data available), more than 13,000 people were treated in hospital emergency rooms due to injuries related to holiday decorating, according to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. Dr. Shawn Evans, an emergency medicine physician at Scripps Memorial Hospital La Jolla in Southern California, says falls are ""hands down the most common reason why we'll see folks this time of year."" Usually these injuries fall into one of three categories, Evans says: older men or women who are putting up lights outside and hurt their head or neck; middle-aged men who've had a couple of drinks while decorating and injure their shoulders or wrists; and kids who are trying to assist and end up with head lacerations or concussions. Evans remembers one horrifying incident from years ago: A man who was hanging decorations on his house eve slipped and managed to get his neck tangled in a string of lights. ""His feet were on the ladder. The ladder could have slipped; he could have hung himself,"" he says. Fortunately the man was rescued by a neighbor, but the accident left a ligature mark across his throat. It's not always decorations that pose a danger during the holidays. Each year, fires kill approximately 400 Americans and cause more than $990 million in damage, according to the U.S. Fire Administration. Christmas trees are often the first item ignited, the National Fire Protection Association says. If you're buying a live tree this year, make sure to check it for freshness by looking at the color (it should be green, not brown) and needles (they shouldn't break when bent or fall off branches easily), according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. And always place a tree away from heat sources like an air vent or fireplace. If you choose an artificial tree, look for a ""fire resistant"" label, the CPSC says. Candles are another fire hazard. The CPSC recommends using flameless candles if you have young children or pets, and placing real candles away from materials that will catch on fire easily. Make sure to extinguish all candles before going to bed at night. Evans says the second most common injuries his staff sees during the holiday season are caused by ""alcohol-and ..."" accidents: alcohol and a motor vehicle; alcohol and an altercation; alcohol and cooking knives. ""There's ample time for people to get out and party, and make less-than-fortunate decisions,"" Evans says. Inappropriate presents -- or those that aren't well-thought out -- can also put people at risk.Some of the most hazardous gifts have wheels, Evans says. From kids who can't wait to test out their new bikes to adults who can't wait to test out their new motorcycles, head and spinal injuries are often seen in the ER around the holidays. ""The message for folks is that if it rolls or requires a helmet, make sure you gift the helmet,"" Evans says. ""Don't rely on the person ... to buy their helmet later on. They will get hurt on Christmas Day."" Doctors also see gun and knife-related injuries post-Christmas. Recipients eager to show off their new gifts are often reckless with the safety of themselves and those around them, Evans says. You would think such tales might make ER staff question the intelligence of the human race. ""You know what it really does? It gives you a great appreciation for the humility of human circumstances,"" Evans says. ""If you really approach it honestly, you and I would do the same thing."" Like when you forget to turn off the outside Christmas lights and sneak outside in your bare feet -- only to end up slipping on a patch of ice. Or thinking you're more than old enough to roller-blade without a helmet, until your head hits the pavement. ""Everybody's (injury) story began with something really plausible,"" Evans warns. Like CNN Health on Facebook .","In 2010, more than 13,000 people were treated for holiday decorating-related injuries .
Falls are the most common reason ERs see patients during the holidays, doctor says .

"(CNN) -- After U.S. President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel discussed hot-button issues like America's surveillance programs during his visit to Berlin on Wednesday, the leaders addressed them with reporters. Obama visited Germany, the United States' largest European trading partner, after attending a G8 conference earlier this week in Northern Ireland. Below is a quick look at what Obama said Wednesday -- a few hours before he spoke to the public at Berlin's Brandenburg Gate -- on European concerns about U.S. surveillance programs, Russia's disagreement with the United States over Syria, and more: . 1) Germany still leery about U.S. surveillance . Merkel and Obama discussed Germany's concerns about the U.S. PRISM program, which monitors e-mails, photos, search histories and other data from American-based Internet companies. Merkel told reporters that she appreciates U.S. cooperation with Germany on cybersecurity, but will continue to discuss with U.S. officials the ""question of balance or proportionality"" of government snooping on the Internet. Obama stressed that ""this is not a situation in which we are rifling through the ordinary e-mails of German citizens or American citizens,"" but that it's a ""circumscribed, narrow system, directed at us being able to protect our people, and all of it is done under the oversight of the courts."" The programs have stopped threats, he said -- including some in Germany. Obama said when he gets back home, he'll try to declassify more information about the programs and have officials ""work very closely with our German intelligence counterparts so that they have clarity and assurance that they are not being abused."" 2) Obama not shaken by halt in Afghan talks . A reporter asked Obama how the United States and Afghan President Hamid Karzai could seemingly be on different pages, after Karzai on Wednesday shelved security talks with the United States amid friction over planned U.S. peace talks with the Taliban in Qatar. Obama didn't seem rattled. ""We had anticipated that at the outset there were going to be some areas of friction, to put it mildly, in getting this thing of the ground,"" he said. The Taliban and other Afghans have ""been fighting for a very long time. There's enormous mistrust."" ""I think President Karzai himself recognizes the need for political reconciliation. The challenge is, how do you get those things started while you're also at war? My hope is ... that despite those challenges, the process will proceed."" 3) On Russia's support for Syria's president . Obama was asked how peace could ever come to Syria when the United States and its allies support the opposition while Russia supports the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Obama didn't dispute the premise that Russia and America are backing opposite sides, but chose to highlight what they publicly hold in common: A desire for peace talks in Geneva. Obama said Russian President Vladimir Putin ""believes what would replace Assad is worse than Assad himself."" ""(But) what I think will become more and more apparent in the coming weeks and months is that without a different government, you can't bring peace, and in fact you're going to see sectarian divisions get worse and worse,"" Obama said. 4) We still love you, Europe . Obama talked up negotiations for a new trans-Atlantic trade pact between the United States and the European Union. And he took the opportunity to allay concerns that the United States might be taking Europe for granted while it courts countries in Asia. ""I know that here in Germany, sometimes there has been talk that the trans-Atlantic alliance is fading in importance, that the United States has turned its attention more towards Asia and the Pacific,"" Obama said. ""In both conversations with Chancellor Merkel and earlier with your president, I reminded them that from our perspective, the relationship with Europe remains the cornerstone of our freedom and our security -- that Europe is our partner in almost everything that we do."" If the free-trade negotiations succeed, he said, ""we can grow economies on both sides of the Atlantic, create jobs, improve efficiency, (and) improve productivity and our competitiveness around the world."" 5) No counterterorrism drones launched from Germany, Obama says . Obama, asked about America's use of unmanned drones to target terror suspects, reiterated what he's said in recent weeks: that the United States is thinking carefully about how it uses the technology. Interestingly, he made it a point to say that the United States doesn't launch drones from Germany for counterterrorism efforts. ""I can say though that we do not use Germany as a launching point for unmanned drones ... as part of our counterterrorism activities. There have been some reports here in Germany that that might be the case, but that is not,"" he said. In Berlin, Obama calls for reducing U.S., Russian nuclear stockpiles .","Obama, after talking to Merkel about U.S. surveillance, says he'll try to declassify more info .

"New York (CNN) -- As construction workers cheered, the final two pieces of a 408-foot spire were hoisted high above their heads Thursday to the top of One World Trade Center. Draped with the American flag, the silver spire settled on a temporary platform. Final installation of the pieces will happen later. ""(It's a) beacon that'll be seen for miles around and give a tremendous indication to people around the entire region, and the world, that we're back and we're better than ever,"" said Steven Plate, director of construction, CNN affiliate WABC reported. Once the building is complete, it will stand at a height of 1,776 feet -- an allusion to the year of the birth of the nation. Already the tallest in New York City, One World Trade Center will be the highest building in the Western Hemisphere. Delivery of the final two sections was delayed by wind and rain, said Anthony Hayes, assistant director of media for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The crowning pieces were supposed to have been delivered last Monday morning. Thursday is the second anniversary of the death of Osama bin Laden, the mastermind behind the September 11, 2001, attacks that toppled the original World Trade Center towers. The spire will contain 18 separate sections of steel and three communication rings. The first -- and heaviest -- steel section was installed in January, weighing more than 67 tons, according to a statement from the Port Authority. It will serve as an antenna for a television broadcast facility housed in the building. ""This is like the icing on the cake for New York,"" construction worker Dennis Muia said, WABC reported. No sign of human remains where latest 9/11 part found . Erinn Cawthon reported from New York; Dana Ford reported and wrote from Atlanta.

"Over the Indian Ocean (CNN) -- The P8 Poseidon dips to the marked spot on the right, tipping closer towards the newly set search zone in the southern Indian Ocean. The entire right window of the spotter's seat is filled with azure blue, zooming by at 302 mph. We're 500 feet above the ocean, but to my untrained eye, it looks so close it's as if I'm on a high diving board skimming a swirling sea. ""We saw a couple of things on our way in,"" explains U.S. Navy Lt. Josh Mize, the tactical coordinator of Rescue 74, the call sign for Friday's mission to seek out debris from missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. The P8 is a Boeing 737 souped up with classified U.S. government electronics and intelligence, powered by jets that move it more nimbly than any consumer plane on the civilian market. I'd love to show you a picture of it, but the State Department forbids any pictures by civilians, ordering me to leave all electronic equipment on the ground. Petty Officer 1st class Robert Pillars called for the ""mark on top,"" the signal for the P8 crew to immediately mark the coordinates on the map. Pillars spotted white objects floating in the distance. I'm one of three reporters on this embed to the new search area. Just hours before, the Australian government said credible evidence supported moving the search 680 miles northeast of the prior search zone. I'm clutching the military green life vest on this tilting jet, wondering if this might just be the debris of Flight 370. We make a second pass over the mark. The 360-degree rotation camera positioned just behind the front landing gear spins around, capturing something in the water. Lt. Clayton Hunt, the patrol plane commander, calls in three items to the regional communications center: the white objects spotted by Pillars, an orange rope and a blue-green bag. The P8 requests that a boat head to the objects and check on them. But the items don't appear important enough to drop a tracking buoy. Four other planes will report similar debris to the Australians from the new search area. The P8 continues on, in the hunt to find debris from the missing plane. ""Mowing the ocean"" The two-hour, 20-minute flight to the new search zone is casual and lighthearted, as the Navy crew adjusts to journalists peppering them with questions. The P8, described by Boeing as the world's most advanced anti-submarine, anti-surface warfare aircraft, flies along a bright fuchsia line on the radar screen. The flight plan estimates a 3,000-mile trip. Once in the search zone, the fuchsia line forms a rectangle, with the plane crossing a horizontal path of about 200 miles, heading north 13 miles, then back across the 200 miles. It repeats the pattern twice. The plane will fly low to surface, at 500 feet. Lt. Kyle Atakturk, the P8's patrol plane pilot, calls it ""mowing the ocean."" At the search area, the chatter stops. The crew's voices lower to a whisper over their closed communications on headsets. This is the ninth trip to the Indian Ocean for the Kadena-deployed naval crew. On half of those trips, says Lt. Clayton Hunt, the team has spotted something. Today's weather is in stark contrast to yesterday because ""visibility's been awesome, one of the best two days we've had,"" says Hunt, the commander. The current is so calm that the plane's shadow follows on the water's surface, perfect and zooming below. If something's out there, Hunt says, ""Oh yeah, we'd see it."" But finding something and finding the plane's debris are two very different discoveries. ""Every mission we see dolphins and seaweed,"" says Petty Officer Pillars, shaking his head. ""Every time, I get like that. See it it in the distance, then get excited. And then find out its seaweed. We want to find something."" Pillars' near-boyish enthusiasm about the mission is infectious, in stark contrast to the seriousness of his eyes as they track a pattern across his spotter's window. You can tell Pillars wants to sit at the window as long as he can, rotating out only when his judgment tells him he needs to rest his eyes. Farther down what the crew calls ""the rail,"" because of the side-by-side radar monitors and chairs, sits Mize, the tactical coordinator. He's in charge of the operation outside the cockpit. ""Our mission is to find it,"" says Mize, his Southern drawl curling around his serious words. ""Do I feel it? Yeah. I want to give them answers."" By ""them"" he means the families of the Malaysia Airlines passengers. The P8 crew, all pilots and crew aboard a plane, feel a kinship with the lives lost in the sky and the families left wondering. ""I think if I was in their shoes, I'd want proof,"" says Lt. Nick Horton who, along with Atakturk and Hunt, is one of three patrol plane pilots on this mission. ""Not knowing is the hard thing, right?"" Silence . The P8 continues quietly. The crew chat into their headphones, inaudible above the noise of the jet. Beyond the one sighting early into the search, there's been only vast, calm sea. About 1,500 miles into the trip, halfway through the search, the crew prepares to drop a ""sonobuoy."" The P8 is equipped with these devices, which it ejects into the ocean to establish drift rate by transmitting a radio frequency signal to the aircraft. The last search zone was so dynamic that it had no pattern and moved 150 yards in three minutes. With a muted ""whoop"" sound, the sonobuoy is ejected. I can see a faint white parachute from the plane's video camera for a second and then it's gone into the endless blue of the ocean. The light fading on the day, Pillars is in his final shift at his spotter's window. The infrared camera comes on; the blue sea is green and black on the grainy screen. The pilots announce the P8 is climbing to 37,000 feet, lifting out of the search zone and returning to Perth Airport. The team has had one spotting -- at best, a possible lead. It returns to the airport, greeted by another P8 that now joins the mission, more air power to try to bring the pieces of this puzzle home.

"(CNN) -- A woman's legs protrude over an empty bar. Manicured hands cling desperately to a ledge. Disheveled femmes fatales crawl across a flowerbed. The racetrack is transformed into an ominous retro time warp in these intriguing images from Canadian photographer Kourtney Roy. ""I would say that my work is sinister, but it's also imbued with a dark humor,"" said the 32-year-old, originally from ""the wilds of northern Ontario."" ""At the racetrack there is a certain energy in the air, it is very magical, even if there is a seedy and dark side to it as well."" Roy's unnerving images could be scenes from a 1960s murder mystery, rather than a sports arena usually filled with stampeding horses and screaming punters. Just who is this glamorous young woman, pictured on an eerily empty race course? In fact it is Roy herself, who donned thrift store costumes for the surreal photo shoot at stadiums across Paris. The cinematic series -- called ""Ils Pensent Déjà Que Je Suis Folle"" or ""They Already Think I'm Crazy"" -- was named the winner of a competition exploring gambling, and exhibited at Le Bal photography center in the French capital. ""During the shoot, people saw what appeared to be a mad woman in a wig throwing her legs up in the air and generally enacting acrobatic poses for the camera,"" she said. ""But I found that it added a certain ambiguity and uncanniness to the scene when I was partially hidden or when my face was unseen. It seems more ominous."" Romance of the racetrack . Growing up in rural Canada, Roy discovered the joys of the racetrack later in life, describing being ""raised by a family of lumberjacks and spending my youth trapping and taming wolves."" ""There were no racetracks where I came from. We were too busy trying not to freeze to death."" Inspired by the writings of hard-living punter and poet Charles Bukowski, Roy later explored the grandstand with gusto. ""There is really nothing like spending an afternoon eating fries and drinking beer, while watching the most magnificent creatures in the world run past you at dazzling speeds,"" said the photographer, who now lives in Paris. Artist impression . She's hardly the first artist drawing inspiration from the track. From Edgar Degat's 19th century paintings depicting jockeys in luminous color, to Audrey Hepburn in the 1964 musical ""My Fair Lady"" and recent HBO series ""Luck"" starring Dustin Hoffman, what makes the racetrack such a ripe backdrop for artists? ""It's got that mystique of people knowing more than you do,"" said Nick Attenborough of Great British Racing, a company which promotes British horseracing around the world. ""It's a sport of intrigue. It's one man betting his judgment against another. One horse trainer or one jockey trying to win against a load of other guys."" Spooky stadium? And it's a different intrigue altogether once the stadium is empty. ""I've been to racecourses before which are quite empty and they're sad places in comparison to the joy, pleasure, and buzz you get when there's racing,"" said Attenborough. ""It's slightly spooky. And that's what Roy's photos have done. The woman leaning over the bar -- there's no drinks, no decorations, and it looks soulless. ""And I dare say that's true of any stadium -- they need people to help them reverberate."" It seems that even without horse racing, the track is still a scene of drama.

"(CNN) -- Lawmakers voted in favor of same-sex marriage in New Hampshire and Maine on Wednesday, leaving Rhode Island as the only other New England state without legislation in favor of the issue. Maine Gov. John Baldacci signed a bill Wednesday legalizing same-sex marriage. Maine Gov. John Baldacci signed his state's same-sex marriage bill less than an hour after the legislature approved it. ""I have come to believe that this is a question of fairness and of equal protection under the law, and that a civil union is not equal to civil marriage,"" Baldacci, a Democrat, said in a statement released as he signed the bill. But he raised the possibility that the citizens of the state would overturn the law, saying: ""Just as the Maine Constitution demands that all people are treated equally under the law, it also guarantees that the ultimate political power in the state belongs to the people."" It was not immediately clear whether New Hampshire Gov. John Lynch, a Democrat who has questioned the need for such legislation, would sign the bill passed Wednesday by the legislature in his state. Lynch said last week he did not think the law is necessary because the state already recognizes civil unions. If he does sign, his state will join New England neighbors Maine, Vermont, Connecticut and Massachusetts, which all have laws approving same-sex marriages. That would leave Rhode Island, which has same-sex marriage bills pending in its general assembly. Iowa is the only other state that allows same-sex marriages, after the Iowa state Supreme Court ruled unanimously on April 3 that it is illegal to discriminate against same-sex couples by denying them the right to marry. The first gay marriages in the state took place April 27. California's state Supreme Court issued a similar ruling in May 2008, after which some 18,000 gay and lesbian couples got married there. But California voters in November approved Proposition 8, which amended the state constitution to ban gay marriage. See which states allow same-sex unions » . The state's high court heard arguments earlier this year about whether Proposition 8 was itself constitutional, but it has not yet issued a verdict. New York Gov. David Paterson introduced legislation in April to make same-sex marriage legal in his state. A similar bill died in the state Senate in 2007. The District of Columbia voted Tuesday to recognize same-sex marriages performed elsewhere, but does not itself give marriage licenses to gay or lesbian couples. In New Hampshire, the House voted 178-167 in favor of the legislation Wednesday after the Senate approved an amended version of the House's original bill last week. The amended version distinguishes between civil and religious marriage. It allows each religion to decide whether to acknowledge same-sex marriage, but extends the option of civil marriage to any two individuals. Meanwhile, the Human Rights Campaign, a gay and lesbian rights organization, praised Maine's new law. ""This law is simply about making sure that loving, committed couples, and their families, receive equal rights and responsibilities. This is a step that will strengthen Maine families,"" Human Rights Campaign President Joe Solmonese said in a written statement. A slim majority of Americans are against legal recognition for same-sex marriage, CNN polling found last month. Fifty-four percent of adults questioned in an April 23-26 nationwide CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll said marriages between gay or lesbian couples should not be recognized as valid, while 44 percent said they should be considered legal. But there was a huge gap between the opinions of younger and older people, with younger people far more likely to approve of gay marriage. Nearly 6 in 10 people ages 18 to 34 said same-sex marriages should be legal. Just over 4 in 10 people ages 35 to 49 agreed. Numbers were similar for 50- to 64-year olds, while only 24 percent of people 65 and older agreed. The survey's sampling error was plus or minus 3 percentage points.","Maine lawmakers passed bill Wednesday, and governor signed it .

"(CNN) -- Her surname means ""fighter"" or ""warrior"" -- and Christine Ohuruogu has done her best to fulfill that prophecy throughout a stellar running career of glorious peaks and painful troughs. She has battled back from heartbreaking injuries and a controversial ban for missing drugs tests to become the first British woman to win 400 meters gold at both the Olympics and the world championships. The Londoner is also the only UK athlete of either gender to have won three global titles in the same discipline. All the gut-busting training sessions and the long periods of rehab have paid off -- but don't suggest to Ohuruogu that she has made any sacrifices to get where she is today. ""I don't really like that word,"" the 30-year-old tells CNN's Human to Hero series. ""I choose to be an athlete and for me to get where I need to get to, ultimately I have to do certain things -- so I don't really see it as a sacrifice. ""There's a lot in life I probably haven't been able to do because of it, but there's a lot that I have done and I have achieved. If I wasn't an athlete, I probably wouldn't have got that chance."" Born to Nigerian parents in the borough of Stratford, near where Britain's Olympic Stadium would later be built for London 2012 -- the scene of one of her greatest moments -- Ohuruogu was a latecomer to athletics. Her first passion was netball, and she represented England at under-17 and under-19 level before finally making the switch. ""At the time I never understood running as a sport -- I thought it was just something you did when you had nothing else to do,"" she recalls. ""It wasn't until a teacher at school saw me running at a sports day event which I had won and he said, 'Oh you look like you have been trained,' ... that is when I started thinking seriously about trying athletics and seeing where I could end up."" But she had to wait until she was 18 before taking it up seriously -- her mother Patience insisted she finish her school studies and start university. Making an impact . Success came quickly, and without a lot of training, as Ohuruogu won bronze at the 2003 European junior championships. She reached the semifinals of the Athens Olympics the following year and then claimed gold at the 2006 Commonwealth Games. At 5 foot 9 inches, with a powerful stride, Ohuruogu seemed perfectly suited to the 400m -- a lung-stretching one-lap burst in between the sprint and middle-distance events. ""You have to be quite smart about how you run the 400 and you really have to know where you expend your energy,"" she says. ""You have to balance your mental approach as well. It is not something you can just be very gung-ho about. You have to be able to maintain a certain speed throughout the whole race. And that is what is very difficult."" Ohuruogu admits she doesn't have a conventional approach to the event -- often surging to success when seemingly out of contention. ""My coach always said that I instinctively know what to do at the right time, so it is hard to juggle what I think I should be doing alongside what I actually do,"" she says. ""I would give myself credit for being able to read the race well. So maybe I do it without even knowing I do it."" Indeed, she says a lot of her success comes from not thinking, from clearing her mind. ""When I am running I actually don't remember anything, which I am happy about because it means I am not there,"" she explains. ""If I remember the race it means I am not concentrating, so ideally I don't always remember what it's like when I running. ""At times I do remember, and that is where I have lost concentration momentarily -- and I think it does cost you in a race. Once you lose just a split-second of concentration, it kind of throws you."" Olympic hopes in jeopardy . Having won her first major title at the 2006 Commonwealths, Ohuruogu's world came crashing down when she was given a one-year suspension for missing three out-of-competition drug tests. Even worse, she faced a lifetime ban from the British Olympic Association -- which left her contemplating the prospect of competing under another country's flag. However, she won an appeal, and just days after the initial punishment expired Ohuruogu claimed a historic victory in GB colors at the 2007 world championships in Osaka. Even better was to come the following year as China hosted the Olympics for the first time. ""A lot of people were saying that I couldn't come back and win the gold in Beijing, but I knew I could win it,"" she says, having set the year's fastest time in the 2008 final as she beat favorite Sanya Richards and another American, Shericka Williams. ""I knew exactly what I was going for. I knew from the outset that I wanted to win gold. I was trying to enjoy the Olympic experience but, also, I knew I had a job to do."" Injury problems . Richards claimed Ohuruogu's crown at the 2009 world championships, and the British runner then tore a thigh muscle the following year -- beginning a series of setbacks that threatened her hopes of success in front of her home fans. ""The hardest thing athletes have to deal with, and I am no exception, is when you have injuries,"" Ohuruogu says. ""It was the biggest injury I've had -- it's quite a ghastly injury, I don't like remembering it very much. ""The doctors said it would take me about a year to get over it and I didn't really believe them -- I thought, 'Yup, I'm super woman, it'll be done in a couple of weeks' time.' ""Every time it'd heal up, I'd tear it again. It really got me thinking as to whether my time in the sport was up."" Ohuruogu did recover sufficiently to be selected for the 2011 world championships in South Korea, but was disqualified in the first round for a false start. ""It was pretty horrible and only compounded my thoughts telling me that enough is enough, go and do something else. And it didn't really get any better from there -- it just got worse and worse."" London calling . But Ohuruogu managed to climb out of her pit of despair, and returned to fitness in time for a tilt at glory on home soil in front of her family. ""From the time I knew the Games were coming to London, I had prepared myself by ignoring it. I just completely zoned out and saw it as just another championship,"" she says. ""I really had to distance myself physically and mentally from it because I knew that if I didn't, I'd become too overwhelmed by the whole thing. ""The athletes' village was a stone's throw away from where I grew up. My parents actually walked home on the night of my final, that's how close we live."" Once again Ohuruogu left it late, coming from fifth place on the final straight, but this time she could not prevent her now-married American rival Richards-Ross from claiming the gold. ""I was a little bit disappointed, but at the same time I was really proud of the fact that the last win I had was in 2008 and I had crossed through all kinds of hell to get that silver medal,"" she says. ""Even though it wasn't gold, to me it meant more than the gold in Beijing because I really had to work really, really hard to put myself in a position where I could contend for a medal."" The future . Ohuruogu made up in part for that disappointment by winning her second world title in 2013, beating Botswana's Amantle Montsho in a photo-finish in a British-record time of 49.78 seconds. Her next challenge is the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, though after another injury-hampered year (not helped by her love of wearing high heels) she has opted to compete in just the 4x400 relay -- the heats are on Friday, the final 24 hours later. Stephanie McPherson won Wednesday's 400m final from fellow Jamaican Novelene Williams-Mills. Ohuruogu's younger sister Victoria -- one of her seven siblings -- will also run in England's relay team, and the 21-year-old could conceivably be a rival in the individual event at the 2016 Rio Olympics. But before Brazil, Ohuruogu is planning to return to Beijing for next year's world championships -- and has her eyes on another homecoming when London hosts the event in 2017. ""I have said a lot that I will stop in Rio but I think that the thought of the world champs coming back to London is kind of tempting me a little bit,"" she says. ""But I will see first of all what happens next year and that will guide my decision-making into Rio, and then obviously what happens in Rio will guide whether I will continue past 2017 or not."" Whatever she decides, there's no doubt Britain's warrior runner will do her best to make it happen.","Christine Ohuruogu is Britain's most successful 400-meters runner .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Egypt's military was quick to quash a newspaper report Thursday that quoted army chief Abdel-Fatah El-Sisi as saying he will run for president. The interview appeared in the Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Siyasa earlier Thursday. And in it, El-Sisi appeared to confirm what many have long considered a foregone conclusion: that he'll run for president. ""The decision has been made,"" he is quoted as saying. ""I have to fulfill the people's demands."" ""We don't have a magic wand but we will not tamper with the people's dreams and aspirations,"" he added. ""Let's hold our hands together and work for the country."" Soon afterward, the army responded. ""What was published in the Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Siyasa is merely journalistic speculation and not a direct statement from Field Marshal El-Sisi,"" it said in a statement. If he does run, El-Sisi will have to resign his military post. But with no clear contender, his chances of winning the presidency are high. He will become the sixth military leader to rule Egypt since its independence. The only one who was democratically elected, Mohamed Morsy, was ousted by the military on July 3 after months of mass protests against his rule. The interim government has not yet set a firm date for elections; candidates can officially declare themselves on February 18. A most adored man . If one man can claim the title of Egypt's most-adored, it would be El-Sisi. Many Egyptians speak of him reverentially. ""A hero,"" or ""a man of respect"" are some of the terms thrown around. ""If he could be my father, that would be great,"" said a repairman who gave his name as Mahmoud. Last week, Egypt's Supreme Council of the Armed Forces gave El-Sisi its blessing to run, calling his candidacy ""a mandate and an obligation."" The same day, he was promoted from general to field marshal. He was defense minister under Morsy. Urging caution . But not everyone is enamored. It was El-Sisi who announced Morsy's ouster, sparking wild celebrations. It was El-Sisi who oversaw the appointment of Egypt's interim leaders. Rights groups say talk of an El-Sisi run shouldn't be cause for celebration, but reasons to worry. ""One has to be a little more worried about a return to military dictatorship,"" said political analyst Sarah Eltantawi. ""This country has been under military dictatorship since 1952. Anyone during that period who tried to organize politically, democratically was jailed and stymied in one way or another. "" Allegations of abuse . The Egyptian army has long been marred by allegations of abusing its power. It was accused of beating and killing protesters who took to the streets to demand then-President Hosni Mubarak's ouster. And when Morsy supporters demonstrated, the army was accused of doing the same. Furthermore, El-Sisi is the same general who defended the use of virginity tests on female protesters. They were meant to shield soldiers from false accusations, he told state media. Grievances gone . But for many Egyptians, the grievances are gone. ""People's livelihooods have really plummeted in the past year, two years, "" said Eltantawi. ""They want stability and the only form of stability that several generations of Egyptians have had have been in the form of the military."" For now, like it or not, the military seems to be playing a central role in post-revolution Egypt where establishing democracy is still the stated goal. But the path to getting there isn't always democratic. CNN's Reza Saya reported from Cairo; Hamdi Alkhshali from Atlanta .","""I have to fulfill the people's demands,"" he says .

"(CNN) -- Singer Jennifer Lopez, famous for her revealing outfits, is expected to take a more modest approach when she hits the stage this weekend in Indonesia and Malaysia -- both Islamic countries. ""She'll have to cover up a little bit,"" said Chairi Ibrahim, project manager for Dyandra Promosindo, one of the promoters for the Jakarta show of the ""Dance Again World Tour"" on Friday. She and all the dancers must wear clothes that don't show men's chests or women's cleavage, and sexual dance moves will have to resemble laughs as opposed to ""making love,"" he added. Some women will wear black ties, he said, based on photos he's seen. The adjustments are in keeping with informal rules that make the concert ""suitable for Indonesia"" and will satisfy the local government, Muslim Indonesians and clerics, Ibrahim said, adding that he spoke with many parties. The near-sellout concert comes nearly six months after Lady Gaga was forced to cancel her sold-out show in Jakarta amid an uproar by Islamic hardliners against her costumes and dance moves. Ibrahim said that Lopez's case was different because ""people know her from 'American Idol,'"" where she'd been a judge, and saw her as a ""normal girl,"" while Indonesian clerics deemed Gaga's lyrics as ""not very good to youngsters."" Lopez is to perform in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on Sunday. On her website, a Malaysian fan (""Yusrizal Hamzah"") expressed concern in September over whether strict rules for women might cause a ""last-minute cancellation,"" citing a canceled Beyonce concert in 2009 as an example. ""Please J.lo! Malaysian fans want u here!"" he wrote. After Kuala Lumpur, Lopez will perform in Singapore and then Australia.","Promoter: Dancer's clothes will cover men's chests, women's cleavage .

"(CNN) -- Bashing Cliven Bundy for his remarks regarding race is like LeBron James dunking on a 5-foot rim: Pointless. And the same is true for Los Angeles Clippers owner Don Sterling, if you believe that he made the remarks attributed to him by TMZ and Deadspin. As President Barack Obama said, ""when ignorant folks want to advertise their ignorance, you don't really have to do anything, you just let them talk."" Still talking about the talk of the ignorant is fun. After all, few things are more entertaining than well-executed memes and a hashtag in front of stupidity. The problem is that while men such as Bundy and Sterling may be racist, they are not the face of racism. Not today's version. But we'll place that yoke on their shoulders anyway because it's easy, like James dunking on a kiddie rim. Some conservatives will quickly pedal away from the Bundys and the Ted Nugents of the world, insisting that they are not like those rodeo clowns. They don't have a racist bone in their body because they would never make such outlandish statements. But then they turn around and marvel at how ""well-spoken"" or ""articulate"" a black person is and think nothing of it. Politicians of all stripes will publicly denounce the offensive things that Bundy says but continue to construct policies that cater to his sensibilities. Today, racism isn't a crazy old white man with a dead calf on his shoulders proclaiming he's ""unracist."" No, it's elected officials such as U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin saying inner-city men are ""not even thinking about working or learning the value and the culture of work"" and then feigning shock that people saw a racist element to his statements. Bundy and Sterling are just the lightning rods of the moment. Not too long ago, Paula Deen was the social pariah. Meanwhile, Racism 2.0 is busily working in the shadows, gerrymandering away voting rights and creating legislation that makes pre-emptively shooting dead a young black man who makes you nervous synonymous with standing one's ground. The longer the media allow ignorant relics like Bundy to continue to hog the spotlight -- and the public points at him as the face of conservative racism -- the longer the current incarnation can go unchecked. That doesn't mean Bundy's fight with the government should be ignored. That doesn't mean Sterling's alleged remarks -- and well-documented past of discrimination -- should be overlooked. Only that their views -- and thus, importance -- should be kept in perspective. For mispronouncing Rosa Parks' name pales in comparison to the politics of courting a racist electorate. It pales in comparison to the lack of compassion for the five children who were shot Easter Sunday at a park on the south side of Chicago or the characterization of poor people as takers. During the height of the recession, according to an analysis in The American Prospect, 33 states increased spending on prisons while decreasing spending on education, and we're to believe the disproportionate number of minorities in jail is a coincidence? So, yeah, yuk it up at Bundy's expense. Keep tweeting #boycottClippers if it makes you feel better (though I'd be more prone to use my 140 characters to ask why the NAACP thought Sterling was a good candidate for a lifetime achievement award). But don't make such people out to be anything more than what they are -- the few remaining voices of oppression from years past. Today racism has a different look. A different sound. A different voice -- though the song is still the same.","Granderson: Bashing Cliven Bundy's remarks is easy, but he's not face of today's racism .

"(CNN) -- Guinea international Lass Bangoura pulled out of a key African Cup of Nations match against Ghana Saturday because his club teammates were worried he could contract Ebola. Bangoura, who plays for Rayo Vallecano in Spain, told the La Liga side's official website that he had been told of their fears in a phone call while training for the Group E qualifier. With Guinea one of the worst affected countries by the deadly virus, the international match had already been moved to the Moroccan city of Casablanca, but that apparently did not satisfy his fellow Rayo squad members. ""My teammates were afraid and at the end of practice I spoke with the (Guinea) coach Michel Dussuyer and said there was a problem, because of Ebola. ""I asked him if I could be excused because I didn't want any problems with the club, because they are the ones who pay my salary,"" he said. Bangoura has now returned to his club, who are based in the Spanish capital Madrid where earlier this week a nurse became the first person in Europe to contract Ebola outside of West Africa. She remains critically ill in hospital. ""My Rayo teammates welcomed me back,"" Bangoura said. ""They have confidence in me, but what people need to understand is that when you are summoned for the national team, you have to see a doctor and get tested. ""Every national team has its own doctor who takes care of these issues. I am fine, there is no problem (with my health),"" he added. The 22-year-old Bangoura is a regular in the Rayo first team and has also established himself in his national squad. He was concerned that his withdrawal could lead to problems for his family back home in Guinea. ""I just spoke to my mother, we have been talking. It is the first time I have left the national team and I am scared that there could be some crazy person who harms my family. ""This afternoon I'll be speaking on my country's radio to say I have no issue with the national team and to say I'm sorry."" The spread of the Ebola virus has had a serious impact on football in affected countries, with all competitive games stopped in Sierra Leona.

"(CNN) -- Western Sydney Wanderers became the first Australian club to win the Asian Champions League after a goalless draw away to Saudi Arabia's Al Hilal ensured a closely fought 1-0 aggregate victory in the tournament final Saturday. A heroic defensive display and some favorable refereeing ensured striker Tom Juric's goal in last week's first leg at the Parramatta Stadium in Sydney was enough to claim the continent's most coveted club prize. Wanderers can now look forward to the FIFA World Club Championships in Morocco next month where they could come up against the likes of Real Madrid or San Lorenzo, current champions of Europe and South America's leading club competitions respectively. The unlikely triumph is all the more remarkable given that the Wanderers were only founded in 2012 and were playing in continental competition for the first time. Only 14 Wanderers fans were given visas to attend the game in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, which was played in front of a highly partisan crowd in the King Fahd Stadium. ""The game was everything you expect from a final,"" explained a delighted Wanderers coach and former Mark Popovic in quotes carried by the Asian Football Confederation website after the match. ""It is still a little surreal for me as a coach. I am sure it will hit home in the next few days when we reflect. ""I am just proud for these players and our club. The first time in the competition, to win it, I think in the future we will really understand how special this run has been and how it was to win this title. Popovic's side have earned a reputation as a mean defensive unit over the course of the competition. Golakeeper Ante Covic was named the player of the tournament after the match and produced a series of spectacular saves in both legs of the final to keep the vastly more experienced Al Hilal at bay. But the keeper was extremely lucky not to give away a penalty midway through the second half when he cleaned out Al Hilal striker Salman al-Faraj in the box.

"(CNN) -- Over its extensive history, 3-D entertainment has seen its share of successes and failures. It started out small, with viewfinder-like devices that were exclusive novelty items for the wealthy. By the middle of the 20th century, 3-D was being marketed to everyone, as the movie industry tried to both capitalize on the technology and compete with television. In recent years, 3-D has tried to invade the home, struggling to define itself as the new standard of digital entertainment. And some mobile gadgets are boasting 3-D screens as well. It hasn't been a smooth journey. Three-dimensional technology has disappeared and reappeared countless times, and its fitful progress has been marked with both big hits and major misses. Now comes news that Amazon on Wednesday is expected to introduce its first phone, possibly one with a 3-D screen that doesn't require special glasses. Will this be the next big thing in the ebb and flow that is 3-D advancement? Maybe. But for some context, here's a look back at the rocky evolution of 3-D. Modest roots . 3-D technology has been around for 170 years, longer than most people realize. First used for photos, it transitioned to motion pictures in 1915 with the invention of anaglyph 3-D -- the process of viewing two differently filtered images through colored glasses to produce an integrated image that the brain interprets as three-dimensional. The first public 3-D movie, a melodrama called ""The Power of Love,"" screened for theater owners in 1922 in Los Angeles. As was standard for movies of that era, it was in black and white and silent. It vanished without a trace. During World War II, the military's use of 3-D photography monopolized the industry. But the technology had disappeared from movie screens. The first rise and fall . As the popularity of television skyrocketed after World War II, 3-D movies made a brief splash in 1952 with the wildly successful movies ""Bwana Devil"" and ""The House of Wax."" ""The movie industry was throwing anything they could at the threat of television,"" said Robert Thompson, director of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture at Syracuse University. ""In order to keep people coming and paying, as opposed to staying at home for free, they had to give them something extra."" The creation of Polaroid filters and interlocking projectors enhanced the quality of 3-D films, but the viewing experience was still uncomfortable for the audience. The images needed to be perfectly aligned, which was difficult to do, and many people complained of sore eyes after 30 minutes. Producers limited their 3-D output to horror movies, which played on viewers' discomfort. But 3-D movies soon died again, as many theaters shifted back to 2-D with the invention of CinemaScope, which presented movies in an ultrawide format. Cost was also a large factor in its decline, as two prints of a movie were needed to project the image over itself. Using the logic that two reels equaled two separate films, distributors charged theaters for both prints, but customers were unwilling to pay twice the cost for the movie. Theaters abandoned the more expensive films, trying to draw back their audiences with more reasonably priced 2-D movies, and 3-D disappeared once again. From 'The Stewardesses' to 'Avatar' In the 1960s, a huge breakthrough in 3-D technology, Space-Vision 3D, removed the need for two cameras to project the movies, decreasing the cost for theater owners. ""The Stewardesses,"" a 1969 soft-core porn film, was the first movie to be released in Stereovision, using anamorphic lenses with a series of Polaroid filters to widen the picture. The movie became the most lucrative 3-D film of its time, costing only $100,000 to make and grossing more than $27 million in North America. But 3-D movies tapered off again due to cost, lingering viewing discomfort and the public's disinterest in the antiquated 3-D glasses. At the turn of a new century, 3-D successfully reintegrated into mainstream films, this time targeting a younger audience with big studio releases of ""The Polar Express"" and numerous other films. Once again, 3-D was back in the public's favor and has held a steady audience since. The release of James Cameron's Oscar-winning film ""Avatar"" in 2009 blew the industry wide open. A huge influx of 3-D movies ensued in the following years, but ""Avatar"" still remains the highest grossing 3-D film so far, raking in over $760 million. The production and box office success of 3-D movies continues today, with more than 50 movies scheduled for release in the next two years and most movie theaters offering at least one 3-D picture at all times. Thompson said that 3-D won't ever be 100% of film production, because not all movies need it. But, he said, ""a movie that does 3-D really well just won't be as good without it."" No-glasses 3-D moves closer to reality . 3-D moves into homes . Despite its successful return to movie theaters, 3-D entertainment hit another stumbling block in its efforts to take over consumers' living rooms. Following the success of ""Avatar,"" 3-D televisions were hyped as the next big thing at the 2010 Consumer Electronics Show. But they never caught on, and four years later, many consider the attempt to bring 3-D into the household a flop. The industry sold 1.1 million 3-D TVs in the first year, and sales have increased slightly since. But there's still a shortage of 3-D content being produced for them, and the televisions were largely missing from this year's CES. Why 3-D TV still hasn't caught on . The two main problems with 3-D TVs are content and equipment, said Paul O'Donovan, principal consumer electronics analyst with Gartner, a technology research and advisory firm. ""Over 50 percent of movies made in 3-D are animated children's movies,"" he said in an e-mail. ""Although children are important in families, few affect the purchasing decisions of AV equipment in the home."" O'Donovan said the equipment issue is probably the biggest reason that 3-D TVs haven't been successful in the home. The cost of buying a Blu-ray player to go with the television or subscribing to a 3-D channel on cable or satellite adds to the already steep cost. ""Then there's those pesky glasses,"" O'Donovan said. ""Most TVs come with a limited number of glasses, and extra active glasses are relatively expensive."" The glasses also remain persistently uncomfortable. It's not over yet for 3-D TV, though, as prototypes of a glasses-free television are supposed to arrive within the next year. ""If 3-D movies are going to take off as a viable alternative to 2-D movies, the television must become standard equipment,"" Thompson said. ""Movies spend a very brief time in theater release, but they spend the rest of their existence on televisions."" A 3-D TV you would actually want to buy . What the future holds . Although TV has seen mixed results, 3-D seems to have migrated successfully to mobile gadgets. The initial release of the Nintendo 3DS handheld gaming system in 2011, although underwhelming, marked another turning point in the technology. The 3DS was the first glasses-free 3-D entertainment product. After a slow start -- the device sold just over 100,000 units in its first quarter -- Nintendo reported sales of 4.5 million units at the end of its first year, and sales remain strong. In 2014, the industry continues to pursue the potential and advancements of 3-D entertainment. If the predictions prove correct, and Amazon does unveil a 3-D phone, it might signal a new wave of possibilities. ""Smartphones will always be small,"" Thompson said. ""Although a 3-D phone without glasses will be cool, it's nothing like the big screen."" But having 3-D graphics on a smartphone would still be better than not having them, he said. ""If this (phone screen) looks great without glasses, it would be a huge breakthrough."" Or, if 3-D's history is any indicator of what's to come, an Amazon phone could be just another peak in the technology's long roller coaster ride.","Amazon is expected to reveal a new phone at an event Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- A man in Canada who was suspected of having Ebola has tested negative for viral hemorrhagic fevers, according to the World Health Organization and Canadian health officials. Viral hemorrhagic fevers is a generic term that refers to a number of diseases found in Africa, including Ebola hemorrhagic fever, Lassa fever, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever and yellow fever, according to Denise Werker, deputy chief medical health officer at the Saskatchewan Ministry of Health. Testing on the man continues, WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl said in a tweet. ""May be malaria. Will know today."" ""The patient in Saskatchewan does not have Ebola, Lassa, Marburg or Crimean Congo virus,"" said a statement from the Deputy Chief Public Health Office in Saskatchewan. ""The risk to Canadians remains very low. In addition, the ruling out of those four hemorrhagic viruses significantly reduces the risk to people who have been in close contact with the patient while the patient has exhibited symptoms."" Health officials in Canada said Monday they were looking into the case of a man exhibiting symptoms consistent with viral hemorrhagic fevers. He had recently traveled from Liberia. ""There is no risk to the general public at all about this incident. We recognize that there's going to be a fair amount of concern, and that's why we wanted to go public with this as soon as possible and dispel some of those myths that are out there,"" Werker told reporters Monday. ""All we know at this point is that we have a person who's critically ill who traveled from a country where these diseases occur,"" Werker said. An Ebola outbreak has killed at least 59 people in Guinea, which borders Liberia in West Africa. Werker said the Canadian patient is in an intensive care unit and isolated, meaning no visitors are allowed. ""To be clear, there are no confirmed cases of Ebola or any other hemorrhagic viruses in Canada,"" the Saskatchewan statement said. ""In fact, there has never been a confirmed case of a hemorrhagic virus in this country."" The hemorrhagic fevers are characterized by high fever and symptoms that may be nondescript. But at the end point of the disease, patients can have bleeding from their mouths or eyes, Werker said. There is no drug treatment for Ebola hemorrhagic fever, but it is not a highly infectious disease. ""You have to be in close proximity to the person's secretions,"" Werker said. ""The persons who are most at risk are person who are actually health care workers, who don't wear protective clothing."" At least 59 dead in Guinea Ebola outbreak . CNN's Miriam Falco and Jacque Wilson contributed to this report.","Health officials say the man tests negative for diseases including Ebola .

"(CNN) -- The deal ending the shutdown may not have put a dent in Obamacare, but the battle over implementing the health coverage law is not over. CNN Fact Check: Obamacare . One venue that Republicans are turning to for leverage, starting next week: oversight hearings, beginning with some tough questions about why the rollout of the website for enrolling in health care exchanges is having so many problems. ""The American people deserve to know what caused this mess,"" said Rep. Fred Upton, R-Michigan, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. ""Delays and technical failures have reached epidemic proportions."" Obama: Website glitches unacceptable . Upton has already asked officials from the Department of Health and Human Services to brief his committee on the problems at a hearing scheduled for next Thursday. He also is asking them to turn over records of their communications with website contractors about the preparations for the site's launch, and the problems people have had trying to use it. Logging into Healthcare.gov tough for some early registrants . Additionally, the chair of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Rep. Darrell Issa, last week wrote to Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius demanding information about the rollout problems. Joining him was Sen. Lamar Alexander, ranking Republican on the Senate committee on health, education, labor and pensions. HHS official: Sebelius not available to testify Thursday . One issue has been the ability to log in to healthcare.gov. A senior administration official told CNN some users, especially those who signed up ""early on,"" have been having trouble logging in, but the administration is working on a fix. There also was conflicting word on whether some passwords were deleted if they were created in the first week or so after the launch. Sebelius concedes there have been implementation difficulties. ""I'll be the first to tell you that the website launch was rockier than we would have liked,"" she told an audience in Cincinnati on Wednesday, during her tour to promote Obamacare. But, she told CNN affiliate WLWT, ""There are constant improvements under way, so that we are getting people in much more quickly."" Nevertheless, a couple of Republicans have called on Sebelius to resign. ""Enough is enough,"" said Sen. Pat Roberts, who has called for her to step down in spite of being a longtime friend of her family. ""Secretary Sebelius has had three and a half years to launch Obamacare, and she has failed."" Rep. John Fleming of Louisiana tells CNN he is working to collect signatures calling for Sebelius to leave. White House spokesman Jay Carney pushed back on Tuesday. ""The secretary does have the full confidence of the president,"" he told reporters. And when he was asked Thursday who would be held accountable for the problems with the website, Carney replied, ""The people who are responsible for making it work are hard at work, fixing the problems that need to be fixed."" He focused instead on the benefits the uninsured Americans are now entitled to. ""The result will be millions of Americans who have insurance who did not have it before. That's the goal. And the goal is not about the website. The goal is that the American people who have been shut out of affordable health care options in the past have those options available to them."" But former White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, while not naming names, said of the website on MSNBC, ""when they get it fixed, I hope they fire some people that were in charge."" Gibbs: Fire those who botched website . Public attention may have been focused more on the shutdown fight this month than the problems with enrolling in the exchanges. But with the shutdown ended, part of the emerging Republican message is that the problems with the Obamacare website reflect broader problems with the law overall. ""I think this is emblematic of how problematic this is going to be in the future,"" said Fleming. At a minimum, the implementation of the individual mandate, requiring people to get health care, should be delayed, he said. But a spokeswoman for Sebelius said the online enrollment process is proceeding. ""While traffic is down somewhat from its peak on day one, it remains high as Americans continue to seek to learn more about their new coverage options,"" said spokeswoman Joanne Peters. How many have signed up for health care? Well, it depends .","Republicans point out problems with healthcare.gov .
Some want HHS secretary to step down over rollout .
White House says technical problems are being fixed .
It says real story is all Americans can get insurance ."
"(CNN) -- Manchester City's misfiring start to the English Premier League season continued on Saturday with a 2-1 loss to West Ham United at Upton Park. The disappointing league result comes off the back of another lackluster display in the Champions League in midweek which saw Manuel Pellegrini's side squander a 2-0 lead against CSKA Moscow to eventually draw the match 2-2. On Saturday, it was City who found themselves two goals down after West Ham's French midfielder Morgan Amalfitano opened the scoring in the 21st minute before Diafra Sakho netted again with 15 minutes remaining. The Senegalese striker's sixth goal in as many league games ultimately sank City who managed to pull one back through David Silva but couldn't find an equalizer. ""We had a lot of chances to score but it is difficult to win if you don't take them,"" City boss, Pellegrini said. ""I don't think it was a fault of our team for the performance in the first half, it was more about the intensity of West Ham and you must credit them for that. We are just starting the season, we have 80 points left to play for. So it is early. ""We will continue fighting because there is no title being handed out at the moment."" The win keeps West Ham in fourth place with 16 points, one point behind City who failed to make up ground on league leaders Chelsea. Jose Mourniho's side will extend their advantage to eight points over City if they beat Manchester United at Old Trafford on Sunday. Elsewhere, there were wins for Southampton who rise to second place thanks to a 1-0 win over Stoke City. Ronald Koeman's side kept the winning habit with their sixth victory in seven league matches and now have 19 points from nine matches. Alexis Sanchez scored a brace to give Arsenal all three points against Sunderland -- the Black Cats have now conceded 10 goals in two matches after shipping eight last weekend. The win gave Arsene Wenger a first league win in four matches and lifts the Gunners up to fifth with Swansea City one place behind following a 2-0 win at Leicester City. Liverpool could only draw 0-0 at home to Hull City -- a result which sees Brendan Rodgers' side slip to seventh in the table. West Bromwich Albion and Crystal Palace also shared the points in a 2-2 draw at the Hawthorns. Dortmund slump continues . Borussia Dortmund's nightmare start to the Bundesliga season continued with a fourth straight league defeat on Saturday against Hannover 96. Hiroshi Kiyotake's 62nd-minute winner consigned Jurgen Klopp's team to a third home defeat of the league season and a sixth loss in all. Their spectacular lack of league victories -- the latest defeat leaves Dortmund hovering above the relegation places in 15th -- is in stark contrast to the club's Champions League form where they are riding high in Group D with three wins from three matches. Compare that to a league run that has yielded one point in the last six games. ""We can't do more, but we can do things better, Klopp said following the latest setback. ""We aren't in a good situation in the Bundesliga and that's something we haven't come to terms with until now. We'll continue to fight, the opponent made a lot out of little, we made nothing out of a lot."" There was little to lift the gloom at Werder Bremen either as their manager Roger Dutt was shown the door on Saturday following Friday's 1-0 loss to FC Cologne. Bremen are without a win this season and are currently anchored to the foot of the table with four points from nine matches. The club has appointed under-23 coach Viktor Skripnik as caretaker manager until a full time replacement can be found. There was joy, however, for Stuttgart who claimed all three points in a 5-4 win at Frankfurt. Martin Harnik and Christian Gentner both scored braces as the visitors leapfrogged Dortmund into 14th place. There were also wins for Augsburg who rise to ninth and Hertha Berlin who move up to 11th. At the business end, Hoffenheim move up to second after a 1-0 win over Paderborn while Leverkusen's 1-0 victory over Schalke lifts Roger Schmidt's side to fourth. Bayern Munich will go six points clear at the top of the table if they beat Borussia Monchengladbach on Sunday.

"(CNN) -- Do you wish you could outsource the summer cooking, cleaning and camp planning associated with kids? Once school's out, keeping the family on schedule can become a full-time job. From finding camps to shuttling children to their activities, summer can be more demanding than the school year. Keeping children engaged can mean the difference between calm and chaos. As a mother of three children under age 8, I've experienced the dark side of summer. I've missed deadlines to book my kids' favorite camps (yes, early February can be too late for popular camps), set myself up for a logistical mess by having to drop off three kids in three locations at the same time, and perhaps the most trying -- the long stretches without structured activities, leaving the kids climbing the walls. What I didn't realize is that professionals exist who will serve as a kiddie concierge of sorts: a personal assistant to make sure you don't drop the ball on all the scheduling, purchasing and transportation duties that can turn summer into an ill-planned purgatory for children and parents alike. So, I sought tips from scheduling experts on how to seek structure and maximize fun during the summer -- and not feel guilty about it: . 1. Delegate drudgery . Parents have a range of options if they want to outsource the logistics of managing summer activities. It doesn't need to break the bank balance. In fact, parents can often use the time they save far more productively. ""For me, it's extremely helpful to have someone who can organize things on the home front,"" said Kathy Dupuy, president of Mom's Best Friend. She founded the Austin, Texas-based family services agency 20 years ago. Dupuy is not only the president, she is also a client. Her own personal assistant helps assemble care packages to send to her kids at sleepaway camp. She also helps prepare for their departure by ironing labels onto their clothes. Most of the personal assistants her agency manages work between 20 and 30 hours each week, for about $25 an hour. She says that rates in Texas are lower than similar services in New York or California. Throughout the year, they buy groceries, organize parties and coordinate household repairs for families, among other tasks. When school's out, personal assistants can be hired to choose the best camps, manage supplies and ensure campers have everything they need when they start. 2. Commission crafts . Dupuy relies on a personal assistant for such tasks as costume creation for her children to wear to theme parties at their camps. A personal assistant can bridge the gap between a parent's skills and the demands of kids' activities. ""I'm not supercrafty,"" she said. ""Having someone who loves Pinterest, who loves to have the time and space to be really creative around a party idea, or birthday party favors, or helping set up for an event. ...I just don't have the time or creativity to do that."" The camps her children attend often have elaborate themed parties. Her personal assistant helps devise and develop creative costumes for her four children, aged 9 to 17, to take to camp. 3. Seek expertise . Before parents start to design the costumes, it helps to know what camps are out there. In many cities, camps book up months before the summer begins. For children who want to try sleepaway camp, parents have a lot of places to turn. ""There are so many camps out there, you can't even imagine,"" said Sue Ellen Greenberg, who calls herself the Camp Lady. According to the American Camp Association, there are more than 12,000 day and resident camps in the United States. Based in New Jersey, Greenberg helps parents pick the perfect sleepaway camps for their children. While parents do not pay for her service, she earns a referral fee from the camp if parents send their children there. ""You need to really understand the camp, and understand your child's personality, and what you're trying to get out of the camp,"" she said. Greenberg said the biggest mistake parents make in choosing a camp is sending their kids to one based on their friends' or neighbors' choices. Picking a camp should be a personal choice. 4. Give up the guilt . If children stay home for the summer, don't be afraid to ask for assistance. ""The advice I would give is: Be comfortable asking for help,"" said Tiffany Ellis, founder of Mama Concierge, outside Chicago. ""A lot of people that do call me, initially, they always say, 'I feel so guilty for calling you, because I'm asking you to do things that I could do myself.' But that's the exact purpose of my business,"" she said. Her clients have employed her for such tasks as finding outdoor swimming lessons for children 5 years old and under, and babysitting triplets while their mother slept. Services can cost between $25 and $50 an hour. ""The less you have to do, the everyday maintenance items, the more you can do with your family,"" said Ellis. She encourages her clients to enjoy that time, guilt free. 5. Have fun . Personal assistants and camp planners say that parents use their services so they can enjoy more time with their children, without getting bogged down in household tasks. The summer can provide parents with an opportunity to hire a local college student, who might be cheaper than a personal assistant, to run to the grocery store or organize a craft. The first day of school comes around quickly. For parents like me who are juggling multiple schedules, the best advice is to try to enjoy summer while it lasts.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Washington City Council voted Tuesday to legalize same-sex marriage in the nation's capital. The bill was approved overwhelmingly by a vote of 11-2. The bill will be given to Mayor Adrian Fenty, who has expressed his support and vowed to sign the bill. If the mayor signs it, Congress will have 30 days to intervene before it would take effect. It is considered unlikely that the Democratic majority on Capitol Hill will block the bill. Tuesday's second vote was needed to send the measure to Fenty. The council passed the bill in an 11-2 vote December 1. If the measure becomes law, Washington will join Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont and Iowa in allowing legal same-sex marriages. A law legalizing gay marriage in New Hampshire takes effect January 1. Council members who voted in favor of the measure hailed Tuesday's second and final vote as a historic moment. ""Today is the final step in this long march,"" Council Member Phil Mendelson said. The two council members who voted against the legislation, Yvette Alexander and former Washington Mayor Marion Barry, said they could not support it because the majority of their constituents did not. Council Member David Catania, who is openly gay and who introduced the measure, said ahead of the vote that he understood the reason behind the dissenting council members' votes. ""They are my friends, and they are decent; this is simply a difference of opinion,"" he said. Lawmakers in Maine approved legalized same-sex marriages this year, but voters in the state last month passed a referendum to overturn the new law. Last week, New York's state Senate defeated a bill that would legalize gay marriages. A similar bill stalled last week in New Jersey's state Senate. Tuesday's vote in the nation's capital prompted approval from gay rights groups. The Human Rights Campaign applauded the passage of the legislation, calling it a ""a victory for all D.C. residents."" ""The legislation the Council passed today reinforces the legal equality and religious freedoms to which all D.C. residents are entitled,"" the organization's president, Joe Solmonese, said in a written statement. The National Organization for Marriage, which opposes same-sex marriage, said ""the fight is not over."" ""Politicians on the city council are acting as if they have the right through legislation to deprive citizens of D.C. of their core civil right to vote, but we will not let them get away with it,"" said Brian Brown, the organization's executive director. ""We will go to Congress; we will go to the courts; we will fight for the people's right to vote,"" he said. Opposition to the legislation also came from the Catholic Church's Archdiocese of Washington, which has said that the measure could restrict the church's ability to provide charity services, apparently because the church might cut back on services rather than comply with requirements. ""Under the bill, religious organizations would be exempt from participating in ceremonies or from teaching about same-sex marriage in religion classes and retreats in accord with their faith beliefs, but they would be required to recognize and promote same-sex marriage everywhere else, including in employment policies, and adoption and foster-care policies, against their beliefs,"" Archbishop Donald W. Wuerl wrote in a November 17 Washington Post opinion piece. He said the church was asking that new language be developed so that faith groups ""can continue to provide services without compromising their deeply held religious teachings and beliefs."" However, Mendelson said Tuesday that more than 200 churches have stated their support for the bill. Last month, the district's board of elections ruled against a proposed ballot initiative that would have defined marriage as between a man and a woman. ""Under current law, the district recognizes as valid same-sex marriages performed in other jurisdictions,"" the board said in a written statement. ""The board concludes that that Marriage Initiative of 2009 would, if passed, strip same-sex couples who have entered into such marriages of rights afforded to them by that recognition."" CNN Deputy Political Director Paul Steinhauser contributed to this story.","Mayor has signaled that he will sign measure; Congress would then review .

"New York (CNN) -- Seeking redemption after a prostitution scandal waylaid his political career, former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer launched a petition campaign Monday in a bid to become the comptroller of New York City. If he succeeds in getting on the ballot for the September primary, Spitzer will join former U.S. Rep. Anthony Weiner -- who is seeking the city's Democratic mayoral nomination -- as disgraced New York politicians trying to revive their careers in the same election. ""Politics is a contact sport,"" Spitzer said Monday morning on radio's ""The Bill Press Show."" ""I made significant errors. I stood up, accepted responsibility, resigned. It's now been five years, I hope the public will extend its forgiveness to me."" The decision was somewhat sudden, with Spitzer telling CBS on Monday that he reached it over the weekend. Now he knows the tough questions will come. ""You need skin as thick as a rhinoceros,"" he said in the CBS interview. Spitzer joins the ranks of other politicians gambling on the forgiveness -- or fleeting memories -- of voters to resume their derailed careers. Spitzer to toss hat back in the political ring . Among them are former South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford, who won a U.S. House seat in May four years after revealing an extramarital affair, and Weiner, who recently jumped into the race for New York mayor after resigning his House seat over sexual-tinged tweets. Spitzer, a Democrat, resigned in 2008 after revelations he spent thousands of dollars on prostitutes. Since stepping down, the Democrat has been a commentator for various news outlets, including CNN. ""I recognize the flaws that led to 2008,"" Spitzer told CNN on Sunday night. In the Monday interviews that coincided with a campaign to gather the 3,750 signatures needed by Thursday to get on the primary ballot, Spitzer said his goal was to return to public service. ""I think anybody's who's been through what I have been through -- sure you want redemption,"" he told CBS. ""I don't think this is the best way to get it. If that's what I want, then I don't think this is the path to it, but what I am seeking is service. ... The most satisfying thing for me ever is public service."" A comptroller's life . A comptroller oversees how an organization reports its finances. It will be a far cry for the 54-year-old former New York attorney general whose reputation as a scourge of white-collar crime propelled him to the governor's office in 2006. ""I have to win over not only Wall Street, but Main Street, and the record of my cases on Wall Street shows I understood the real problems,"" he said Sunday. Spitzer said he has his wife's support as he jumps back into political life but doesn't know if she'll be joining him on the campaign trail. Asked Monday if they were separated, he said no. When politics gives you a second chance . Second chances . Politics is full of second chances. Just ask Sanford. His political career was left for dead when he disclosed -- after disappearing from the public eye for nearly a week in 2009 -- that he was having an affair with an Argentine woman. He told his staff he was hiking the Appalachian Trail during his absence but eventually admitted he had been in Buenos Aires. He withstood an impeachment attempt in the South Carolina Legislature, but his wife divorced him. Cut to 2013, when Sanford ran in a special election to fill a vacant U.S. House seat in South Carolina. He won the GOP primary and then defeated a Democratic challenger to return to Washington, where he previously was a congressman before becoming governor. Weiner hopes for a similarly successful comeback. He was in his seventh term in Congress representing parts of Brooklyn and Queens when he was caught sending lewd photos and messages to multiple women.

"(CNN) -- Several same-sex couples came together in the first minutes of New Year's Day in Honolulu to become the first in the state's history to enter into civil unions. ""We really don't want to wait any longer because we have been together for 33 years waiting for the opportunity and our rights and everything that goes with it,"" said Donna Gedge, who was with her partner Monica Montgomery, speaking to CNN affiliate KITV. ""So why wait?"" The couple told CNN last week about their plans to stay up late for the ceremony. With Hawaii and Delaware joining the list Sunday, five states now recognize same-sex civil unions, while six other states and Washington, D.C., allow same-sex marriage, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Illinois, New Jersey, and Rhode Island already recognize civil unions providing state-level spousal rights to same-sex couples, the NCSL says. Marriage licenses are given to same-sex couples in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa, Vermont, New Hampshire, New York and the District of Columbia, the NCSL says. California does not currently allow same-sex marriages to be performed. In May 2008, the state's Supreme Court ruled that same-sex couples have the right to marry in California. Proposition 8, a state constitutional amendment defining marriage as between a man and a woman, passed later that year. In 2010, a federal district judge ruled that Proposition 8 violated the U.S. Constitution, but enforcement of that decision was stayed pending appeal. Delaware said its new law became effective at 10 a.m. Sunday. In Hawaii, online application for civil union licenses was made available beginning at midnight, despite the fact that government offices are closed until Tuesday, the state government said. The union becomes valid after a ceremony performed by someone licensed by the Department of Health. ""It means that our state supports us, and that's a really good feeling after all this time,"" Montgomery said at the ceremony. The laws in Delaware and Hawaii followed heated debates in both states. In 2010, then-Gov. Linda Lingle, a Republican, vetoed a similar bill in Hawaii, saying the issue needed to be put to a referendum. Some religious groups were among those pushing for the move. ""We need you to mount a campaign to flood the governor's office with requests to veto the bill,"" Larry Silva, Catholic bishop of Honolulu, wrote on the Diocese of Honolulu's website at the time. A group called the Hawaii Family Forum argued that ""a vote for civil unions is a vote for same-sex marriage."" ""Civil unions are a desperate and dishonest attempt to force same-sex 'marriage' on Hawaii,"" the group said. Despite the opposition, there was no referendum. In both Hawaii and Delaware, the language of the law emphasizes that ""it is not the legislature's intent to revise the definition or eligibility requirements of marriage."" Gedge and Montgomery told CNN last week they hope there will one day be federally recognized same-sex marriage. Hawaii Gov. Neil Abercrombie, a Democrat, signed the state's civil unions bill into law last February, calling it ""a prime example of exercising civic courage. It is about doing what is right, no matter how difficult, no matter how much opposition."" Delaware Gov. Jack Markell, a Democrat, signed his state's bill into law in May. The Delaware Family Policy Council, which says its goal is to ""educate, equip, unify and engage the citizens of Delaware in advocating for family values and preserving the integrity of the family as an institution,"" argued that civil unions ""are a springboard to redefining marriage."" ""You can't really talk about civil unions without talking about same-sex 'marriage' because there really isn't any difference,"" the group argued. But Markell, at a signing ceremony last year, said, ""This bill is about a new energy and excitement. It's about a moment in our history that came about because people came together to work for it, because it became clear that Delaware's LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) community is in fact part of every Delaware community. The greater good is served when we speak out and fight hard when we see that bias, prejudice or even outdated laws attempt to lessen any one of us."" Bonnie Limatoc, who was part of the midnight ceremony in Hawaii on Sunday, told KITV, ""The historic part for me is to be one of the first to open that door so that the rest of them after us, there's others out there that want to do this. ... We can show them, ""Hey, you love somebody, you have the right to be with them the rest of your life also.'"" ""Our message is go for the gusto,"" her partner Lydia Pontin added. ""Don't be ashamed."" CNN's Brianna Keilar contributed to this report.","Hawaii and Delaware began allowing same-sex civil unions Sunday .

"(CNN) -- Daniel Ricciardo took advantage of a rare sign of vulnerability from the all-conquering Mercedes team to score his maiden victory in a thrilling finish to the Canadian Grand Prix Sunday. The Red Bull rookie overtook title leader Nico Rosberg in the closing stages of the 70-lap race in Montreal and took the checkered flag under the safety car after Felipe Massa of Williams and Sergio Perez in his Force India crashed while battling for minor places. It was an astonishing turn around after another race set to be dominated by Mercedes with title leader Rosberg battling to hold off teammate Lewis Hamilton for the honors. The early stages had been marked by an early safety car when the two Marussias of Briton Max Chilton and Frenchman Jules Bianchi's collided on the first lap. Rosberg, who started from pole, eventually came under pressure from Hamilton, who had initially lost second place to Vettel. But both suffered power problems, allowing the pack to close up with Massa briefly taking the lead. Hamilton finally passed Rosberg to take second, but then was forced to retire with a rear brake problem. Rosberg, who reclaimed the lead, was unable to hold off the charging Ricciardo, but will be consoled by opening up a potentially decisive 22-point lead in the championship race over Hamilton. In a fine day for Red Bull, four-time champion Sebastian Vettel completed the final podium spot, but has been beaten by his precocious teammate in the last five races. ""I am still a bit in shock,"" Ricciardo said at the presentations. ""Hamilton had a problem and Rosberg was slow down the straights,"" he revealed. ""I really struggled to get past (Sergio) Perez but managed to finally get a run out of the last chicane and get a nice run out of turn one and set my sights on Nico with couple of laps to go. ""I finally managed to get in the right spot to use DRS and it's an amazing feeling right now."" Rosberg, winner of the last race in Monaco, had made a brave attempt to hold on to his lead. ""I lost a lot of power in the straights but it did not quite work out. I couldn't hold off Daniel Ricciardo,"" he admitted. Behind the front runners, Jenson Button took a fine fourth for McLaren with Nico Hulkenberg in fifth for Force India and Fernando Alonso sixth for Ferrari. Finn Valtteri Bottas was seventh in the second Williams ahead of Frenchman Jean-Eric Vergne of Toro Rosso. Danish rookie Kevin Magnussen in the second McLaren and Kimi Raikkonen in the second Ferrari completed the points scoring. Perez and Massa, who walked away from their 240kph crashes, were classified 11th and 12th, scant consolation after both scented victory as Mercedes faltered.","Daniel Ricciardo wins Canadian GP for Red Bull .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- The Indian navy suffered its worst peacetime disaster this week when an explosion and fire sank a submarine with 18 sailors on board in a Mumbai dockyard. Divers have entered the vessel's sunken hulk, but have so far been unable to locate those trapped inside. Navy officials, meanwhile, are trying to figure out what went wrong on the INS Sindhurakshak, a submarine that had only recently returned from an extensive refitting in Russia. They are also facing the challenge of patrolling India's vast coastline with an aging, and now depleted, submarine fleet. The sinking of the submarine is ""an unprecedented setback to the national effort to strengthen undersea defense capabilities,"" The Hindu, a daily newspaper, said in an editorial Thursday. The disaster struck at a particularly unfortunate time for Indian authorities, as Prime Minister Manmohan Singh acknowledged in a speech Thursday to mark the 66th anniversary of India's independence from Britain. India unveils home-built aircraft carrier . ""The accident is all the more painful because the navy had recently achieved two major successes in the form of its first nuclear submarine, INS Arihant, and the aircraft carrier, INS Vikrant,"" he said. ""Eighteen brave sailors are feared to have lost their lives,"" Singh said. The Indian navy had last week activated the reactor on the Arihant, its first domestically built nuclear submarine. And on Monday, it launched the Vikrant, a home-built aircraft carrier. In a country where the military has long relied heavily on Russian military hardware, Singh and other officials had hailed both events as big steps forward for India's technological capabilities. But the explosion and fire aboard the Sindhurakshak brought the moment of national pride to an abrupt end. Navy officials have ordered an investigation into what set off the blast. At a news conference Wednesday, Indian navy chief D.K. Joshi struggled to come up with possible theories about the cause, noting that the recently refurbished submarine had received ""highly satisfactory gradings"" in an inspection last month. ""We are at this point in time unable to put our finger on what could have actually gone wrong,"" he said. The Sindhurakshak was one of 10 Kilo-class diesel-electric submarines supplied to the Indian navy by the Russian defense contractor Rosvooruzhenie. The navy also has four smaller German-built diesel electric submarines, and one nuclear-powered submarine leased from Russia last year. According to the navy, the 10 Kilo-class vessels have ""a displacement of 3,000 tonnes, a maximum diving depth of 300 meters, top speed of 18 knots, and are able to operate solo for 45 days with a crew of 53."" Commissioned between 1986 and 2000, some of them are also getting on a bit. The Sindhurakshak was commissioned in 1997. But after its recent refit, from which it only returned in April, it ""was probably the most modern submarine"" in the navy's inventory, said Rahul Bedi, India correspondent for IHS Jane's Defence Weekly. The redesign included the installation of new missile, communication and cooling systems, as well as a new radar, Russian state news agency Itar Tass reported. The upgrade also included other measures to improve the submarine's combat quality and operational safety, the agency said. With the Sindhurakshak now apparently a write off, the navy will have to make do with the 14 submarines it has left. That falls well short of its desired level of 24, according to Bedi. And four or five of the remaining vessels are due for retirement because of their age. ""They're being kept alive by various means,"" Bedi said. ""They're in the ICU, as it were."" Reinforcements, meanwhile, appear to be a long way off. Plans to modernize the fleet have been delayed by about five or six years because of ""technical problems, bureaucratic wrangling and cost overruns,"" Bedi said. A series of corruption scandals in recent months, including in a new submarine project, have paralyzed government decision-making about expensive investments, he said. The delays are holding back the Indian navy's efforts to counter China's increasing maritime strength in Asia. The navy wants to play a more assertive role throughout the Indian Ocean, a crucial zone for world trade, and farther afield, according to Bedi. CNN's Harmeet Shah Singh reported from New Delhi, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong. CNN's Mallika Kapur in Mumbai contributed to this report.","An explosion and fire hit the INS Sindhurakshak early Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- Ben Ainslie lives for sailing. He grew up near the sea, and he wants to retire on the ocean wave. But before then, the most successful yachtsman in Olympic history is taking on one of the biggest challenges his sport has to offer -- the America's Cup. From dominating the world of dinghy racing as a fiercely competitive individual -- who once famously warned his rivals, ""You don't want to make me angry"" -- the 36-year-old is now learning to helm towering 72-foot multihull catamarans. The masts are 130-foot high -- more than 20 times the average height of the 11 crew. ""I really love these boats because they are very physical, they're very dynamic, they're fast, exciting and the racing is very close, and I think it's great to watch on TV now,"" the Briton told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""The top speed of these boats is around about 30 knots, or 35 miles an hour, which is pretty quick when you're that close to the water."" While Britain has a strong naval history and has had a lot of sailing success in the Olympics -- Ainslie won four golds and a silver medal -- it has never won the America's Cup, the elite competition in yachting that is funded by billionaires and traditionally dominated by the U.S. since it started in 1851. ""All my career the America's Cup has been a goal, I've always wanted to be with a winning team -- preferably a winning British team -- and I really felt that I'd done all I could at the Olympic level,"" he said. ""We've never won it so I think there's something there in our maritime history ... we really need to put that record straight."" Ainslie has set up his own team with a view to taking part in a future America's Cup, but for now he has taken on a role as helmsman for the second boat run by defending champion Oracle ahead of the 34th edition of the race in San Francisco in September, making him effectively a reserve to its No. 1 Jimmy Spithill of Australia. His JP Morgan-sponsored BAR team -- which is supported by Oracle -- finished third in the final event of the America's Cup World Series in Naples this month, competing in smaller 45-foot catamarans. ""It will take time. We're building the team up through this series,"" he said. ""That's great for us to get out there racing against these other teams and learn how to get the most speed out of these multihulls. ""From there on it's going to be important to really start building the commercial relationships so we have the funding in place for 2014 onwards so we can really start building up the team."" From being his own boss in the dinghy classes, Ainslie is now learning to enjoy being part of a collective effort. ""That element of team work is something that's really critical,"" he said. ""It's also a lot of fun sailing with other guys rather than just on your own all the time."" The America's Cup is big business. Oracle owner Larry Ellison -- last year named the third-richest man in the U.S. -- spent a reported $300 million before winning the coveted title in 2010. That victory came after a series of lawsuits against the defending team Alinghi which delayed the historic competition and raised big doubts about its future. It will be hosted by an American syndicate, the Golden Gate Yacht Club, for the first time since 1995 and Oracle -- as it has the right as defender -- has revamped the rules to bring the racing closer to shore and more accessible to spectators. But while the sport has an elitist image, Ainslie says that anyone can enjoy sailing. ""People think it's either a very expensive sport or it's just far too complicated -- and really it's neither,"" said the Englishman, whose family moved to Cornwall on the south-west coast of the UK when he was young. ""At the grassroots level you can go down to a sailing club and you can just get into a dinghy and borrow a boat or start sailing and crewing for someone else and get into it for very little money."" Ainslie's Olympic days came to a glorious golden end at London 2012, as he overcame what he thought were dubious race tactics to beat his rivals and claim the Finn Class title in the final race. He accused Dane Jonas Hogh-Christensen and Dutchman Pieter-Jan Postma of teaming up on him, forcing him to do a penalty turn in race two, which left him trailing. Ainslie went public with his displeasure. ""They've made a big mistake,"" he told reporters, and promptly fought back to match the record for successive sailing golds held by the legendary Dane Paul Elvstrom. ""It was the highlight of my career and so special being in front of a home crowd and being my fourth gold medal,"" he said. It capped a Games career which began as a teenager in Atlanta in 1996 where his ""disappointment"" at having to settle for a silver medal in the Laser Class gave an early glimpse of his burning desire for victory. The 19-year-old Ainslie was edged out of the top spot on the podium by the hugely experienced Brazilian Robert Scheidt, but he was never beaten again in Olympic competition. ""It was a great achievement for my age but in a way something inside of me still wanted more and I guess that what's drove me on,"" Ainslie admitted. By the time the Sydney Games came along four years later Ainslie was ready to take his revenge on Scheidt, relegating him to the silver medal position after a bitter and often controversial personal battle. ""I had an immense rivalry with Scheidt and I just managed to come out on top of that, and from then on really that gave me the confidence to come back each time and take the gold, and fortunately I was able to do that,"" he said. After the Sydney Olympics he stepped up to the more demanding Finn Class, meaning he had to add nearly 20 kilograms of extra body weight to be competitive in his new discipline in a bigger boat. ""That was a big switch physically, I had to try and do most of that in muscle so I got into a lot of weight training and fitness training,"" he said. ""I guess it put quite a lot of load on the body as well and hence the back injuries which I started picking up later on in my career."" Those injury niggles were the result of hours of training in the gym and on the water, pushing himself to the limit in search of that fourth gold -- in front of fanatical home support at the southern coastal resort of Weymouth, where the sailing events for London 2012 were held. ""The pressure for London was like nothing else I've ever experienced, "" Ainslie said. A hint of the almost crushing weight of expectation came as he competed for a sixth world championship title in the Finn Class in Perth in late 2011, one of his last major competitions before London. After finishing second in race nine of the event, Ainslie made the headlines for the wrong reasons after swimming over to a media boat and angrily remonstrating with the crew. He felt they had impeded his progress during a downwind leg and his frustration boiled over. Ainslie's subsequent disqualification was a bitter pill, but he later apologized for ""overreacting."" Although injuries have taken their toll on Ainslie -- whose success at London 2012 earned him a knighthood from Queen Elizabeth -- he says that he has never lost his love for being on the water. ""If I get a holiday or some down time I love still sailing, but not racing -- just going out on maybe a beautiful classic yacht, relaxing with friends and being on the water,"" he said. ""My idea of retirement would be having a nice boat, sailing around the world and exploring and being able to relax and enjoy being on the water -- to just enjoy life without running around quite so hectically!""","Ben Ainslie is the most successful sailor in Olympic history .

"Ottawa, Canada (CNN) -- The name 'Storm' may be gender-neutral, but it is also listed as a synonym for controversy. And at just 4 months old, blond-haired, blue-eyed Storm and his Canadian family have stirred a parenting debate still brewing across continents. Kathy Witterick, 38, and David Stocker, 39 are parents raising three children in Toronto. They feel children are pressured at far too tender an age by strict social norms of gender. And so, as a remedy, they felt it was better to keep the youngest child's gender a secret -- even from the grandparents. According to a front-page article in the Toronto Star last week, the only ones who know the baby's gender are the couple's sons -- Jazz, 5, and Kio, 2 -- a close family friend and two midwives present at delivery. Instead of the usual birth announcement of 'It's a Boy!' or 'It's a Girl!', Stocker and Witterick sent out an e-mail announcement that said, ""We've decided not to share Storm's sex for now -- a tribute to freedom and choice in place of limitation, a stand up to what the world could become in Storm's lifetime (a more progressive place? ...)."" Not yet, apparently. Comments about the article were so sharp and so divided that for now, the family has decided to decline any further media interviews. Calls to their home by CNN were not returned. A message on the family voicemail says, ""Thanks for your interest in this important discussion, but at the moment, we're really swamped and our first priority is the needs of our family and especially our kids. So, leave a message if you'd like and we'll respond to it whenever we're able."" Witterick and Stocker may not be talking, but it seems everybody else is. From radio call-in shows all over the continent, to a ""hot topic"" discussion on ABC's ""The View,"" few lacked an opinion. Most said they were either appalled by the couple or applauded them for their courage. ""They are shell-shocked by the reaction of people that have been quite vehement. They didn't really understand what would happen,"" said Joe Hall, managing editor of the Toronto Star. Hall said it was obvious from the very beginning -- even during meetings with his editorial staff -- that people could not help but express very divided opinions about the choice these parents are making. The article has become the newspaper's most popular online story ever. One reader wrote: ""Wow, a good way to ruin your kid's life. Gender has nothing to do with sexuality. I think the parents are going to the extreme here. And what did someone do? Call all media and say, 'Hey all, these people are keeping their poor child's gender a secret'?? What's the hidden agenda here? A reality show? A book? Movie?"" But others countered that the couple's decision was inspiring. ""Bravo to these parents for bravely taking on the gender-biased world that labels children with stereotypes and gendered assumptions before they are even born!"" one post read. ""All parenting is an experiment -- but most people are happy to let Disney or Mattel run the lab. I hope your beautiful little family will stay strong against the conservative attack."" In a follow-up article written by the Toronto Star's Jayme Poisson -- the only journalist so far to visit with the family -- the couple expressed dismay with all the reaction but says it is hopeful the debate can still be constructive. In the Toronto Star article, Witterick writes that, ""Isn't defensiveness sometimes a first sign of learning or changing behaviour, so even the 'rabid' responses may have a place in making the world a more thoughtful place.""","Couple decides to hide baby's gender from the world .

"(CNN) -- He's won six Olympic medals on two legs, but Bode Miller's future will ride on four. One of the finest skiers of all time, the American's obsessive attention to detail has paid dividends during his mercurial career on the slopes. Now, as the 37-year-old enters the autumn of his alpine skiing days, Miller hopes to transfer his meticulous approach to training racehorses. He is convinced that technology is key to equine success, and he aims to take his flair for innovation from the piste to the racetrack. ""I'm one of the people who sees it really clearly because I'm in a different sport that uses all that stuff,"" Miller told CNN at last weekend's World Cup ski opener in Solden, Austria. ""The people in horse racing don't see it at all. They think it's crazy, they think it's like voodoo and magic, and for us it's just normal stuff."" In Miller's experience, success can be achieved by the smallest of margins. Winless for two years and dogged by injury, it was a heart-in-mouth moment when he roared down the mountain at February's Sochi Winter Games in a final attempt to add to his Olympic medal tally. ""I've always been very scientific in my approach -- in Sochi I changed from using a rubber goggle strap to a plastic strap because research showed it would save me one-hundredth of a second,"" he explained at the premier of a new documentary ""Quest for the Future,"" about life after skiing. ""I took bronze by one-hundredth of a second!"" Miller's ""leave-no-stone-unturned"" attitude has served him well. He was famously one of the first athletes to break away from the U.S. ski team -- and be successful. In addition to his Olympic haul, Miller boasts five world championship medals, 33 World Cup victories and two overall titles to boot. And, although he enters horse racing as something of a novice, Miller is confident that a modern approach could reap rich rewards. ""Twenty-five years ago, ski racing equipment was archaic. I came in and said, 'Let's build shape skis' and a bunch of other changes, and the sport changed really dramatically and allowed me to be on the front end of it for a long time,"" he says. ""Twenty years ago horse racing was the same, but now it's in a perfect place where sport and technology can be put together. It's all invented already, but you just have to apply it in the right way."" It's not the first time Miller's attention has been drawn away from ski racing. In 2010, following an invitation from the United States Tennis Association, Miller tried and failed to qualify for the U.S. Open, losing his opening match at the sectional playoffs. But his passion for flat racing has been bubbling under the surface for some time. Ever since becoming a small-portion owner in a racehorse 10 years ago, Miller has slowly developed his knowledge and expertise to the level that he can now realize his ambition of a full-time career in the sport. And it's clear the high-stakes nature of racing appeals to his basic instincts. ""The horses perform at their highest level -- they're trying with everything they have,"" Miller says. ""I think coming from ski racing I can appreciate that. Losing by just a nose, or a whisker,"" he smiles, ""it's tough."" As with everything Miller commits himself to, only ""the best"" will do. ""It really has a lot of the critical components of things that I love in my life,"" he continues. ""To set that on top of the challenge of figuring out an industry and becoming the best in the world at something ... It's just the icing on the cake."" But this time he won't be going it alone. Helping him out of the starting gate is one of the best trainers in the business, Bob Baffert, who appears to provide the ""Yin"" to Miller's ""Yang."" ""For me he's a great example of how to balance out expert horsemanship -- which he has -- with sports science and technology, which is what I have,"" Miller says of his new partner. And with three Kentucky Derby wins under his belt, Baffert also brings a wealth of knowledge of what it takes to win America's preeminent flat racing event -- a long-held ambition for Miller. ""When people talk about a horse race, that's the one they talk about,"" he says. ""It's the biggest showpiece, it has the same prestige in the sport the same way Kitzbuhel does in ski racing. It's a very challenging race to win."" So what of his skiing career? Miller fueled speculation that he would compete at the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang after signing a four-year contract with helmet manufacturer Dainese. But he was quick to dismiss the rumor on Twitter, citing his already advanced years for a top skier. At this stage of the game, health has become a real consideration for Miller. On Sunday he withdrew from the 2014-15 season's first World Cup event in Solden with an ongoing back injury -- a sign that he's no longer willing to put his body on the line. ""If it was golf then, you know, maybe I could lag on for another couple of years and keep competing because there's no real harm in it,"" he admits. ""In skiing, if you make the wrong mistake or you're not fully prepared, you can kill yourself. ""If I'm not in peak form or putting in all the work you need to be prepared and safe, then I'll pull away from the sport."" The high-octane world of flat racing holds no such risks for Miller, only tantalizing rewards. And as he moves into his twilight years on the snow, this workhorse has a feeling the turf will suit him just fine. ""I can stay focused on something indefinitely for as long as it needs to happen, and I love that horses are the same way,"" he says. ""When you put a horse to task they do what you ask them to every time, so building a scenario which helps them to peak at the right time is really appealing to me. It's exactly what we do in ski racing.""","American skier Bode Miller is looking to start new career in horse racing .

"(CNN) -- ""It's the story of morning afters and sweet departures...and the stains we leave on each other"" -- so begins the trailer for ""Shuga,"" a cutting-edge MTV drama that's been a smash hit in Africa. For many young Africans, the three-part TV series about a group of students in Nairobi living under the constant specter of HIV/AIDS is the story of their own lives -- and is the reason ""Shuga"" took the continent by storm when it debuted late last year. Actress Sharon Olago, who played promiscuous party girl Violet in ""Shuga,"" believes the Kenyan show has been so successful because it mirrors the complexities of modern young life, without falling into a moralistic, conventional narrative on safe sex. ""'Shuga' did not exaggerate anything, it relived what Kenya is,"" says Olago. ""That is why it got the fame it did, that is why people jumped into it, because people saw themselves in it."" Set and filmed on location in Nairobi, the soap opera came about after UNICEF teamed up with MTV to create a health campaign to impact the lives of youths in Kenya, where an estimated 6.5 percent of its population lives with HIV. Part of MTV's Staying Alive campaign, ""Shuga"" was designed and produced to draw its young audience to crucial health and social issues. Its bold style distinguished it from many other TV shows in Africa and won it fans across the continent. The show follows Ayira, a 22-year old college student whose ambition and hunger for the high life is complicating her relationship with her boyfriend Ty; Ayira's friend Violet, a party girl whose many sexual exploits is straining her friendships; and Kenneth, Skola and Leo, members of the wealthy, swaggering, fast boy crew on campus. ""Shuga"" portrays a modern city, complete with the vices that go hand in hand with 21st century life. At the center of most of the action is Ayira, played by Lupita Nyong'o. While the MTV and UNICEF campaign driving the show emphasizes the importance of safe sex and HIV testing, it also talks about ""how HIV/AIDS is not a death sentence -- and that's a really, really important thing,"" according to Nyong'o. ""If one catches it early on, you can live a healthy life with HIV,"" the actress, who is currently enrolled in a drama course at Yale University in the United States, told CNN. Nyong'o, whose mother worked in a family planning clinic when she was a child, says ""Shuga"" has given her a platform to speak about HIV/AIDS to a wider audience. The show has struck a chord with young audiences. A staggering 60 percent of Kenyan youths saw ""Shuga"" -- and 90 percent said they intended to change their behavior as a result, according to a survey conducted by Johns Hopkins University following the show's broadcast. The show not only made an impact on its viewers, however; its cast says ""Shuga"" forever changed their lives for the better.

"(CNN) -- Rescue teams are scrambling to reach the site of Monday morning's strong and shallow earthquake in northwestern China that has killed at least 89 people, according to state media. Another 593 people were injured and five were believed missing after the quake tore through Gansu Province, China Daily reported. The quake hit along the border of two counties -- Min and Zhang -- at around 7:45 a.m. local time, according to state news agency Xinhua. Emergency services are converging on the area, including the Red Cross Society of China, which is sending 200 tents and other supplies to shelter and sustain those left without homes. According to state broadcaster CCTV, Chinese President Xi Jinping has urged crews to prioritize the rescue of survivors and minimize casualties. The original quake and powerful aftershocks caused roofs to collapse, cut telecommunications lines and damaged a major highway linking the provincial capital of Lanzhou to the south, according to the China Daily newspaper. More than 300 armed police troops and 64 heavy machines have been dispatched to repair National Highway No. 212, the paper reported. Train services in the area have also been suspended. Rescue efforts are expected to be hampered by heavy rain that's soaked the region in recent weeks. More rain is forecast and experts have warned about potential landslides. According to the Gansu Provincial Seismological Bureau, the quake registered a magnitude of 6.6, however the U.S. Geological Survey said it was a 5.9-magnitude tremor, which struck at the relatively shallow depth of about half a mile (1 kilometer). The epicenter was eight miles (13 kilometers) east of Chabu and 110 miles (177 kilometers) south-southeast of Lanzhou, the USGS said. Tremors were still being felt from the quake, Xinhua said, quoting sources within the Min County government. Locals said buildings and trees shook for about a minute. Residents within the earthquake zone took to Weibo -- China's version of Twitter -- soon after to describe how the earth shook. ""This morning at 7:40 I was brushing my teeth, all of a sudden everything shook for a few moments, I thought I didn't get enough sleep last night and was feeling dizzy,"" @wyyy wrote. ""Turns out it was an earthquake, sigh, seems that with the huge rain downpour outside, we really don't know how much longer this planet is going to let us live here.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Trailblazing White House journalist Helen Thomas has died at age 92 after a long illness, sources told CNN Saturday. Thomas covered 10 presidents over nearly half a century, and became a legend in the industry. She was a fixture at White House news conferences -- sitting front and center late in her career -- where she frequently exasperated government spokesmen with her pointed questions. Thomas began covering the White House for United Press International when John F. Kennedy became president in 1961 and was a fixture there until her retirement in 2010. She was considered the dean of the White House press corps because she was the longest-serving White House journalist. Thomas will be buried in Detroit, and a memorial service is planned in Washington in October, according to her family. President Barack Obama said that it was ""not just the length of her tenure, but her fierce belief that our democracy works best when we ask tough questions and hold our leaders to account,"" that put her in high esteem. In a written statement, Obama called Thomas a ""true pioneer"" and said she kept the presidents she covered -- including himself -- on their toes. ""Helen was just a living inspiration"" Her career, however, came to an end under a cloud of controversy. Thomas, then working for the media conglomerate Hearst as a syndicated columnist, was blasted for comments she made regarding Jewish people. In 2010, a YouTube video surfaced showing her saying that Israel should ""get the hell out of Palestine,"" and that the Jewish people should go home to ""Poland, Germany ... and America and everywhere else."" Thomas apologized for her remarks, writing, ""They do not reflect my heartfelt belief that peace will come to the Middle East only when all parties recognize the need for mutual respect and tolerance. May that day come soon."" She announced her retirement one week later. In 2012, Palestinian official Hanan Ashrawi presented Thomas with an award. She was a mentor to young journalists . Helen Thomas: Fast Facts . Thomas, the daughter of Lebanese immigrants, was born in Winchester, Kentucky, on August 4, 1920. She was one of nine children. Thomas was raised in Detroit, where she attended Wayne State University and graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1942. In October 1971, Thomas married Douglas Cornell; he died in 1982. She wrote three books: ""Front Row at the White House: My Life and Times"" (1999); ""Thanks for the Memories Mr. President: Wit and Wisdom from the Front Row at the White House"" (2002); and ""Watchdogs of Democracy? The Waning Washington Press Corps and How it Has Failed the Public"" (2006). Share your memories . In describing her job, Thomas once said, ""I've never covered the president in any way other than that he is ultimately responsible."" Along the way, she broke some barriers by becoming the first female president of the prestigious White House Correspondents' Association and Washington's Gridiron Club. ""I hope there are many women following me right in this same spot,"" she said. Well into her 80s, she was a mentor to many young journalists. Thomas left UPI in May 2000, when the wire service was sold to a company controlled by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon, the Korean founder and leader of the worldwide Unification Church. Two months later, Hearst News Service hired her as a syndicated columnist, and she returned to the White House for fodder for her columns. Former President Bill Clinton and his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, recalled Thomas' ""tough-minded dedication."" ""Helen was a pioneering journalist who, while adding more than her share of cracks to the glass ceiling, never failed to bring intensity and tenacity to her White House beat,"" the Clintons said in a statement. ""... Her work was extraordinary because of her intelligence, her lively spirit and great sense of humor, and most importantly her commitment to the role of a strong press in a healthy democracy."" No question seemed off-limits . Colleagues remember her as a genuinely fearless woman who asked the toughest questions of presidents, no matter their party. In January 2009, as President George Bush was preparing to leave office, Thomas aimed her editorial guns at him and his administration. Among her criticisms: that before the September 11, 2001, terror attacks, administration officials ignored ""significant early warnings of an imminent strike against the U.S."" Journalists remember Helen Thomas . In a commentary, she slammed Bush for what she considered his failings, including leading the country ""into a senseless war against Iraq, a calamity still under way as he leaves office almost six years after the invasion."" She considered him ""the worst president ever."" Thomas embraced the freedoms of a columnist with vigor. ""I censored myself for 50 years when I was a reporter,"" Thomas told an audience at the Massachusetts of Technology (MIT) in late 2002. ""Now I wake up and ask myself, 'Who do I hate today?'"" One afternoon in October 2009, she targeted President Barack Obama's spokesman, Robert Gibbs, during the daily briefing. Health care reform was being debated at the time, and Thomas asked Gibbs every day whether a public option would be part of the package. In the back-and-forth that ensued, Thomas said that she already had reached a conclusion but could not get a straight answer from the presidential spokesman. ""Then why do you keep asking me?"" Gibbs inquired. ""Because I want your conscience to bother you,"" Thomas replied. The room broke into laughter as Gibbs turned red. People we've lost in 2013 . CNN's Chelsea J.

Lt. Col. Morris ""Moose"" Fontenot Jr., based out the 104th Fighter Wing in Westfield, Massachusetts, was killed in the crash. An Air Force Academy graduate, Fontenot earned the Meritorious Service Medal, the Air Medal, the Aerial Achievement Medal, the Air Force Commendation Medal, the Air Force Achievement Medal and the Combat Readiness Medal, among others, for his service. He had more than 17 years of F-15 flying experience. He also completed active-duty assignments in Japan, Washington, Idaho, Florida and Alaska. He joined the Massachusetts Air National Guard in February. His body was found in the mountains near Deerfield Valley, Virginia, on Thursday evening, according to Lt. Anthony Mutti, spokesman for Barnes Air National Guard Base. The search for the single-seat aircraft was complicated by the remote, wooded location of the crash, near the Virginia-West Virginia border. Before losing contact, Fontenot had reported an in-flight emergency, according to Col. James Keefe, 104th Fighter Wing commander.","Lt. Col.

"(CNN) -- The period since September 11, 2001, will never be described by any historian as a golden age of U.S. foreign policy. I know. I have just written a history on it, and it's not pretty. Since 9/11, the United States has swung unsettlingly from one set of flawed policies to another. First, the unilateralist excess of the first term of the Bush administration; its signature error was the invasion of Iraq. Then, the reactive swing of Barack Obama, toward disengagement and dithering. In a tragic irony, a war in Iraq may someday also be seen as the enduring symbol of his errors. Some of the nation's problems come from nearly 15 years of a heightened sense of vulnerability. We're frayed and on edge and have let dysfunctional politics get ahead of national interests. But others are tied to human errors that can be fixed. The genius of the U.S. system is that it is built to change. Obama finds himself at the end of a string of errors of judgment and execution. These have contributed to damaged relations or crises ranging from those in Syria and Iraq to Libya to Egypt and Israel, from Ukraine to Afghanistan to Africa. They include crises at our own borders and strained relations with our allies over NSA eavesdropping. But Obama is not condemned to further errors. What he does need to produce constructive change however, is a quality rare and vital in any leader: the ability to recognize when one has made mistakes. Who to turn to as a model? The best example may well be George W. Bush himself. Because whatever mistakes Bush made in office -- and they were many -- in his second term, Bush recognized the urgent need for change and instituted a sweeping reordering of his administration, its policies and priorities. He replaced his chief of staff, secretaries of state, defense and Treasury, as well as his national security adviser, and he modified the role of the powerful vice president. He also changed his own engagement on key issues like Iraq, instituting weekly conference calls with his leaders on the ground. And he rewrote key policies, launching the surge in Iraq, initiating the ""light footprint"" approach to fighting terror later adopted by Obama and responding to the financial crisis. In region after region, the results were better, including on social issues like fighting AIDS in Africa, in relations with allies, in results in war zones or in deals like the India nuclear accord. He also actively sought to bring new, outside perspectives into his second term team, a stark contrast to the Obama approach. Cabinet secretaries in Bush's second term, such as Defense Secretary Robert Gates (later Obama's defense secretary) or Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson or new military commanders he appointed had not been part of his inner circle. Bush's willingness to admit errors and embrace change may have stemmed from his own failures and struggles earlier in life: as a congressional candidate, in the oil business, as a baseball team owner and even with alcohol. To get ahead, he had to acknowledge his shortcomings and fix them. He also turned this ability to see his way through tough times into a plus in another important role he embraced, that of a kind of coach-in-chief. Obama is seen as aloof from his Cabinet. All the Bush Cabinet members with whom I spoke told a strikingly different story. Ambassador James Jeffrey, who served as deputy national security adviser to Bush and then as Obama's Iraq ambassador, tells a story of one top Bush economic official having a moment of crisis and doubt in the darkest days of the financial catastrophe. Jeffrey listened as Bush bucked up his aide, restoring his confidence, telling him he was the best person for the job, letting him know he would back him on key decisions. This was in stark contrast to the White House-centric Obama approach that has left Cabinet officers feeling sidelined. It is easy to dismiss such stories when viewed in the context of politics or the very real, and in some cases historically significant, errors of the Bush years. Still, if President Obama is to begin to grow in office, he would be wise to look beyond politically inspired caricatures to see what worked for the man who occupied the Oval Office before him. Obama has his own life experience, of course. He will never be like Bush, in ways both good and bad. But what he may see is that at a moment of comparable foreign policy strains and dysfunctions, Bush was not content to give up or to punt to the future or play the blame game. He knew that in the American system, big change is sometimes needed and that it would never happen unless he did what no one else could do: Stand up to himself -- the President of the United States -- and demand he admit his mistakes and lead administration-wide change from within.","David Rothkopf: Both Bush and Obama have overseen unsettled era of post 9/11 foreign policy .

"(CNN) -- Tempted as I am to write about Anthony Weiner's sexual compulsions, I think it is more important to talk about his wife, Huma Abedin. What the hell was she doing at Weiner's press conference Tuesday, where he once again asked her and the public for forgiveness for a new set of sexual transgressions, instead of being at her attorney's office? If this were a multiple-choice test for my students in my class on intimate relationships at the University of Washington, I might phrase the question like this: . Two years after the former congressman (and now New York City mayoral candidate) left his office in disgrace because he had ""sexted"" revealing pictures of his body to women, he was alleged to have once again taken on an anonymous identity, reportedly making sexual overtures and exchanging explicit pictures with a young woman. Why did Abedin stand by him and defend him in a press conference? A) She is insanely ambitious and wants to be the wife of a successful politician. B) She believes he has a problem and she is going to help him with it because that's what a woman does for her man. C) She believes in her marriage vows and can't stand the idea of breaking up her family. D) All of the above. D is probably the right answer. Congress and lewd photos: An Anthony Weiner timeline . It's one thing to stay with your guy when he has a big problem. It's another to support him going after public office only to find yourself dragged in front of the cameras again after he engages in the same compulsive sexual behavior that you forgave before. She could have said, ""OK, we'll fix this, but we need you in treatment, not in public office."" Obviously, leaving public office isn't in the cards, and that's significant. But A and C also ring true. Abedin's behaviors are squarely in the realm of women's high esteem for love, friendship and loyalty, and for tending and befriending the weak and the beleaguered, as described by UCLA psychologist and professor Shelley Taylor. This gives the impression of being a doormat, but the woman thinks of it as being stalwart and noble. Abedin may not be quite in this category -- but she seems dangerously close to it. Finally, there is the role of family. For some women ""till death do us part"" means just that. They believe in staying in a marriage no matter what, especially when a small child is involved. If the man is a good father -- and there is every indication Weiner is -- a wife will go to extremes to stay married . So why does Huma stay? We don't know, but it's surely complicated. Her steadfastness is hard to watch though. She doesn't deserve this, and he doesn't deserve her. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Pepper Schwartz.","Pepper Schwartz: Why did Huma Abedin stand by husband in new sexual scandal?

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- Lady Gaga has canceled her concert in Indonesia, her management said Sunday, citing security concerns after Islamic hardliners denounced her costumes and dance moves as too risqué. If the concert were held, there would be concerns the singer, her crew and attendees may be in harm's way, said Minola Sebayang, the lawyer for the promoters. ""This is an advice from her security team. So the cancellation is purely based on the decision made by her management,"" Sebayang said. Before she was Gaga: The unseen photos . Earlier this month, Jakarta police recommended that Lady Gaga's sold-out June 3 show not be issued a permit because of security concerns. The pop diva appeared to acknowledge the incident in a post on Twitter on Saturday: ""There is nothing Holy about hatred."" On Sunday, she tweeted confirmation of the cancelation: ""We had to cancel the concert in Indonesia. I'm so very sorry and the fans & just as devastated as you if not more. You are everything to me,"" she wrote. ""I will try to put together something special for you. My love for Indonesia has only grown,"" the performer said. Islamists and conservative Muslims have decried Lady Gaga's upcoming concert, saying her revealing costumes and sensual dance moves are forbidden by Islamic law. The chairman of the Islamic Defenders Front, Habib Rizieq, said his group could not guarantee security if the concert were held. Indonesia has the largest Muslim population in the world. In March, the pop star got a thumbs-down by the country's highest Islamic authority, according to The Jakarta Globe. Indonesian Council of Ulema chairman Cholil Ridwan was urging Muslims not to attend the controversial singer's upcoming concert in Jakarta, the newspaper reported. ""(The concert is) intended to destroy the nation's morality,"" Ridwan told the Globe. Ridwan is concerned that the singer's revealing outfits and sexy dance moves will set a bad example for Muslim youths. Newspaper reports said more than 25,000 tickets were sold in the first two hours after the concert went on sale in March. Police said the promoter should not have started selling tickets before getting a permit. This is not the first controversy surrounding the singer's ""Born This Way"" tour. Gaga also ran afoul of Christian groups in South Korea, prompting the government to ban people under the age of 18 from attending her show. Last week, Christian groups in the Philippines protested Lady Gaga's performances there Monday and Tuesday.

"(CNN) -- There's a classic rap song from the early 1990s called ""It Was a Good Day"" where Ice Cube chronicles 24 hours of peace and happiness on the otherwise rough and dangerous streets of South Central Los Angeles. Twenty-four hours when he didn't have to shoot his AK-47. When he won a ton of money gambling. And when he had lots of sex. Naturally, the only part of the song I can relate to is the fact that he ate breakfast. Of course, Ice Cube's ""good day"" was purely fictional. It's just a song. And if you want to have a quick listen, my best advice is to wear headphones because it's definitely not safe for work. (That said, mom, if you are at home, feel free to blast it loud and be all gangsta. Invite the neighbors. Get funky.) But what if this was real? What if Ice Cube really did have a good day. When might that have been? The answer: January 20, 1992. At least according to 28-year-old stand-up-comedian Donovan Strain. In early 2012 -- 20 years after the song was originally released -- Strain, with presumably nothing better to do between gigs, actually pinpointed this specific date by piecing together key facts from the lyrics. ""It only took me 30 minutes,"" he wrote me in an e-mail. ""I did all the research on my iPhone while I was upside down on my couch."" Really, I'm encouraged by his general lack of effort. Strain may or may not have burned an entire calorie while, once again, proving all good things in life can be accomplished in half an hour. And probably without pants. Strain later posted his research on Tumblr where, perhaps, somebody would find a noble application for this otherwise completely useless information. And amazingly, because we are living in truly magical times, somebody actually did. A few weeks ago, four longtime friends got together and launched an online fundraising project based on Strain's research and Ice Cube's Song. They're calling it the Good Day Blimp. I spoke with two of the project creators, Jon Barco and Andy Dao, and they explained that their goal is to raise a bunch of money and then guilt-trip (my words) the Goodyear company into flying their iconic airship high in the sky on January 20 while spelling out in lights: ICE CUBE'S A PIMP. This, referencing key lyrics from the song: . No helicopter looking for a murder / Two in the morning, got the Fat Burger / Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp / And it read ""Ice Cube's a Pimp."" Basically, these guys want to make Ice Cube's good day the best day. For everyone! And, to do so, they're aiming to raise at least $25,000 through Crowdtilt that they will then donate to the South Central Los Angeles charity, A Place Called Home, which works to provide a safe, positive, family environment for at-risk youth. But Goodyear must agree to fly the blimp and light up the sky with ICE CUBE'S A PIMP. Essentially, it's corporate extortion for a good cause. Andy Dao told me they want to ""rally the masses to donate money ... in hopes to put enough social pressure on Goodyear."" He also added, ""We wouldn't have put this much work into something like this if we didn't think there was at least some percentage of obtaining the goal."" But the Good Day Blimp guys might not want to hold their breath. Goodyear explained to CNN that they ""receive thousands of requests every year for our blimps. Unfortunately, we are not able to accommodate all of these. However, we are proud of our long record of supporting charities over the past 40 years."" The company also said they would speak directly with A Place Called Home to find a way to support the organization. To be fair to Goodyear, they do have to be careful about setting a bad precedent. If you fly it for one organization, it's difficult to say no to others. ""Hi, this is Jim from the National Association of Naked Clowns."" But, in this specific case, the request does sort of have a very direct connection to the blimp. So it's different. And if Goodyear decides to let this one happen, people just might understand. But there's also the issue of the word ""pimp."" It's not necessarily profane, but it also isn't one of the key buzzwords that companies like to use publicly. (Other words to avoid include: napalm, Miley, and gonads.) The point is this. When you're flying a corporate blimp, displaying the word ""PIMP"" is certainly a bit more taboo than, say, lighting up the sky with: ""DIANE, WILL YOU MARRY ME?"" Yet, decidedly less taboo than: ""NAPALM MILEY GONADS."" Jon Barco acknowledges that even if they raise the $25k, it's going to be tough to convince Goodyear to use the word ""pimp."" He says, ""That word is a point of contention for sure. But we want to remind people that good days do exist, and the best way to do that is with one big, grand gesture."" So what does Ice Cube think of all this? Coincidentally, he just happened to be in the CNN Center in Atlanta this week, promoting his new movie ""Ride Along"" with Kevin Hart. I caught up with him in the hallway and told him all about the project. ""I think it's dope,"" he said. (Dope means ""good,"" mom. Sort of like your meatloaf is totally dope!) ""You know, I've been trying to get (Goodyear) to do it for years, and now we have some real momentum behind it."" Cube further endorsed the project by saying, ""Let's try to get 'ICE CUBE'S A PIMP' up on that blimp soon, man. Donate! Put in your church money! Give everything!"" Or just a little. All donations are welcome, but those who give $50 or more will receive a special limited edition ""Good Day Blimp"" poster illustrated by the artist, Michael Marsicano. If they reach the money goal and Goodyear complies, that is. The project creators stressed that they will never actually touch the funds, and if everything goes according to plan, A Place Called Home will get the money directly from Crowdtilt. If it fails, donations will not be processed. So, it's all or nothing. And nothing would be very un-dope. Unlike my mom's meatloaf.

"(CNN) -- Zimbabwe has known only one leader in its entire 33-year history as an independent nation, and President Robert Mugabe hopes that doesn't change any time soon. Voters head to the polls Wednesday for the first time since the violence-marred election in 2008 to choose between the 89-year-old incumbent and his arch political rival-turned-prime minister, Morgan Tsvangirai. Interactive: Democracy in Africa . As the July 31 vote day approaches, Zimbabwean election officials and some human rights organizations are giving sharply different assessments on the likely validity of the vote. Once again, there are allegations that Mugabe's government is targeting the opposition through military intimidation and arrests, and that it is padding the voter list. But the deputy chairwoman of Zimbabwe's Electoral Commission insists that the country is ready for the elections, and vowed the outcome will be valid. ""Elections will be credible, free and fair,"" Joyce Kazembe told the South African Press Association this week. Some 600 foreign observers are monitoring the ballot, in addition to 6,000 local monitors, according to SAPA. Zimbabwe did not invite Western observers to monitor the elections because of sanctions imposed on Mugabe and his top officials for rights abuses. The African Union, which has sent more than 60 members to monitor the elections, has also expressed confidence in the process. ""The environment in Zimbabwe so far reassures us that that the conditions are good for the election to be held on July 31,"" Aisha Abdullahi, AU commissioner for political affairs, said at a news conference last week, according to SAPA. Some observers say that the country may not be as ready as the African Union and Zimbabwe officials suggest. A Human Rights Watch investigation last month found that the Zimbabwe national army ""has deployed soldiers across the country, intimidating, beating, and otherwise abusing perceived supporters of the Movement for Democratic Change or those critical of the government."" Zimbabwe, seeking election funding, turns to neighboring countries . Zimbabwe's government has also arrested lawyers and members of organizations they see as threatening, according to Beatrice Mtetwa, a human rights lawyer based in Zimbabwe. ""Certainly in the last nine months we've seen a lot of civil society activists being arrested,"" Mtetwa told CNN's Christiane Amanpour last month. ""I also believe that my arrest is part of that crackdown because they want as few human rights lawyers to be out there during the election period as they can manage to stop,"" she added. Mtetwa was detained in March after she asked police for a search warrant when they searched one of her clients' homes, Amnesty International documented. When she told the police that what they were doing was ""unlawful, unconstitutional, illegal and undemocratic,"" she was arrested for ""obstructing the course of justice."" There are also concerns that the voter roll may be inaccurate. More than 1 million people on the roll were found to be either deceased or departed, while 63 constituencies had more registered voters than inhabitants, according to a report last month by Research and Advocacy Unit, a Harare-based non-governmental research organization. ""Such statistics suggest that the gap between the ideal and the actual impinges upon the integrity of Zimbabwe's electoral process,"" the report stated. Opposition party leaders and observers have called for postponement of elections, saying that more time is required to establish a transparent voting process. At a news conference on Friday -- just five days before the election -- Tsvangirai said that ""there is clear evidence of manipulation"" in poll preparations. Tsvangirai claimed that ballot papers cast in his favor during early voting for security services were discovered tossed in a bin. ""There is a desperate attempt to subvert the people's will,"" he said. Early voting for security services members has already seen problems due to shortages of ballot papers and voting ink. Out of 63,268 people who were eligible to vote in the early polling, only 37,108 voted, according to Kazembe. Tsvangirai and the Southern Africa Development Community have urged Mugabe to delay the ballot. There are fears that this election could descend into violence like the last election in 2008, which resulted in a runoff. Tsvangirai pulled out of the runoff, citing intimidation, torture, mutilation and murder of his supporters. Regional leaders dismissed Zimbabwe's 2008 election as a sham, and the SADC pressured Mugabe to form a power-sharing agreement with Tsvangirai and his opposition Movement for Democratic Change. As a result, the two bitter rivals entered into an uneasy governing coalition in 2009. Some 6.4 million voters in Zimbabwe -- about half of the country's population -- will be eligible to cast their ballots on Wednesday, according to the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission. The elections will be held under a new constitution endorsed in a referendum in March that limits the president to two five-year terms. Mugabe is allowed to seek another term because the new charter does not apply retroactively. Last week, Mugabe had a few words for critics of the upcoming election. In response to criticisms from the United States on his push for elections without key reforms, Mugabe said at a rally, ""Keep your pink nose out of our affairs, please.""

"(CNN)  -- The Kurdish region of Iraq has seen gains in human rights, but security forces ""regularly abuse their authority"" and women continue to be targets of violence, Amnesty International said Tuesday. Iraqi Kurds mark International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women in November 2008. The international human rights group drew the conclusions in a report titled ""Hope and Fear, Human Rights in Kurdistan Region of Iraq."" The Kurdish region has been an island of relative stability during the Iraq war, and the report said it has ""witnessed growing prosperity"" and has made progress in human rights. But serious problems remain, Amnesty said. Asayish forces, as the local security forces are called, arrested and arbitrarily detained people, ""including some who were tortured or forcibly disappeared and whose fate and whereabouts remain unknown,"" the report said. The report said the torture included electric shocks, sleep deprivation, kicking, suspension by the wrists and ankles, and beatings with fists, cables and batons. Malcolm Smart, Amnesty's director of the Middle East and North Africa Programme, said the Kurdistan Regional Government ""must take concrete steps to rein in these forces and make them fully accountable under the law if recent human rights gains are to prove effective."" Amnesty said that Kurdish authorities have also failed to control the security wings of the Kurdistan Democratic Party and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, the two major Kurdish political movements that make up the regional government. The report, based on research from a fact-finding mission last year, said the Kurdistan Regional Government has made progress in human rights, citing, for example, the release of political prisoners detained without charges or trial. It also cites legislation expanding freedom of expression and measures that strengthen women's rights, and said several agencies are working to monitor and prevent violence against women. But Smart said problems such as ""arbitrary detention and torture, attacks on journalists and freedom of expression, and violence against women"" haven't ended and ""need urgently to be addressed by the government."" As for abuse against women, authorities must ""redouble their efforts to overcome discrimination and violence against women,"" he said, ""and end the vicious cycle of so-called honor killings and other attacks on women by men who wish to subordinate them."" According to official records, the report said, at least 102 women and girls were killed between the beginning of July 2007 and the end of June 2008 in the region. ""These include an unknown number of 'honor killings' -- women who were killed by male relatives because their behavior was considered to have infringed traditional codes of 'honor.' Victims of 'honor crimes' include women who have objected to being forcibly married as well as women who were found having telephone contact with a man without approval of their family,"" the report said. The report said 262 women and children ""died or were severely injured in the same period due to intentional burning, including suicides. Some women were reported to have been burned to disguise a killing."" The report cites one woman who was strangled to death apparently by her brother ""because of her suspected relationship with another man."" A 17-year-old female ""was shot dead after she sought a divorce from her husband."" A 13-year-old girl burned herself to death ""to escape forcible marriage to an adult man."" ""Such cases show how much more still needs to be done by the KRG authorities to give women and girls effective protection against violence from those who wish to control their behavior or force them into marriages against their will,"" Smart said. ""No effort should be spared to prosecute and imprison those who commit violence against women, and to make clear that those who perpetrate these crimes cannot escape justice."" The report also said that emerging independent press outlets that have criticized the KRG or have focused on the security forces, human rights violations and government corruption have been harassed. Journalists ""have been detained, beaten and harassed"" by security forces, and several newspapers have been sued by the KRG.","Kurdish security forces arbitrarily detain, torture people, Amnesty International says .

"(CNN) -- New York Yankees future Hall of Fame third baseman Alex Rodriguez is returning to the lineup he was forced from on July 24 when a bone in his left hand was fractured by a pitch from Seattle Mariners ace Felix Hernandez. Rodriguez, who had to leave the game, was awarded first base after being hit, but there were no other penalties to Hernandez, who, on a night when his control was off, hit two other Yankees (three of the last five batters he faced) before giving way to a relief pitcher in a game that ended with a 4-2 Seattle victory. (Rodriguez is expected to be back in the lineup for the Yankees' Monday night game in Tampa, Florida.) Rodriguez was lucky his injury wasn't more serious. He did not get hit in the head, but under Major League Baseball's current rules, a serious injury to Rodriguez would have been treated the same as a minor injury. There is no meaningful penalty in baseball for a pitcher hitting a batter with the ball. Yet what the helmet-to-helmet hit is to football, the bean ball and its cousin, the brushback pitch, are to baseball -- a tactic that is potentially life-threatening. The National Football League, stung by lawsuits and a series of cases in which autopsies done on players in their 40s and 50s have revealed brain damage, has stiffened penalties for hits to the head and shortened the distance on kickoffs to reduce the violent collisions they produce. By contrast, Major League Baseball appears to have learned nothing from history when it comes to rules for protecting batters. Little has changed from 1920, when Ray Chapman, a shortstop for the Cleveland Indians, was killed by a high fastball thrown by Carl Mays of the New York Yankees. Yet over the years there have been numerous, highly publicized cases of beanings that could easily have been fatal. In 1967 Boston Red Sox outfielder Tony Conigliaro, the youngest home run champion in American League history, sustained permanent eye damage and missed the rest of the season when he was hit by a pitch from Jack Hamilton of the California Angels. In 2000, New York Mets catcher Mike Piazza was forced to miss the All-Star game as a result of the concussion and headaches that followed a beaning by the New York Yankees Roger Clemens, a notorious brushback pitcher, whom Piazza had tagged for a grand-slam home run a month earlier. How many serious injuries have resulted over the years from batters being hit by pitches is impossible to say. Major League Baseball has never kept systematic records on this issue and the dark side of the game that it reflects. Pitchers who like to intimidate batters and pitchers who don't have good command of their pitches have been free to go about their business without fear of penalty. Major League Baseball's substitute for rules that penalize a pitcher for hitting batters has been equipment, namely the plastic helmet. The helmet became mandatory in 1971 and with the addition of earflaps, helmets have improved over the years. But mandatory helmets should be a last, not a first, resort when it comes to player safety. Helmets minimize the damage that occurs after a beaning. They fail to give pitchers incentive to avoid throwing brushback pitches in the first place. What is needed to make pitchers avoid brushback pitches along with the beanings that come with them are a series of rules with penalties that send a clear message: Major League Baseball is serious about protecting its players. Rule 1: Distinguish between a pitch that is dangerous and a pitch that is life-threatening. The head and face are the most vulnerable areas for a player, and a pitch that hits a player anywhere above his chest should be treated with special harshness. Instead, of being awarded first base, a batter struck above the chest should be given second base and thus put in a position to score on a single. Rule 2: Treat a pitcher who hits more than one batter differently from a pitcher who hits a single batter. A pitcher who hits a second batter in a game should face automatic ejection and a fine of $10,000, no matter where his pitch lands. The severity of this penalty would mean any pitcher who thrives on intimidation would be put on a short leash, but it would also recognize that a pitcher who has poor control is a menace. Rule 3: Make a team, not just an individual pitcher, accountable for hit batters. Under this rule a team would be able to get away with hitting only one batter per game. Any time a second batter was hit, the pitcher who threw the ball would be treated as if he had already struck a batter. A team could not, as a result, game the penalty system for hitting batters. Rule 4: Increase pitcher liability for a hit batsman. Rodriguez has been lost to the Yankees for a good part of the season, while Hernandez, who now has a 13-6 record, has enjoyed a stellar year. The result is unfair to Rodriguez and the Yankees. The only way to equalize the situation partially is make any pitcher who forces an opponent out of the lineup remain out of his own team's lineup for the same number of games as the injured opponent. Traditionalists will complain about such reforms, but throughout its history Major League Baseball has done much to alter its original product. It has made the ball livelier, allowed individual teams to alter their outfields to give themselves an advantage and even banned the spitball. What is different about these hit-batter rule changes is that their aim is safety rather than entertainment. A few batters might take advantage of them and try to get hit, but given the dangers that come from a pitch traveling upward of 90 mph, most batters are not likely to risk their careers just to get on base. These reforms don't turn baseball into a game for softies or cheats. Instead, they preserve the national pastime we know by making sure those who play it don't risk life and limb any more than they need to. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nicolaus Mills.","Alex Rodriguez is returning to New York Yankees' lineup six weeks after a pitch hit him .

"(CNN) -- ""Oh, look at all the swans,"" she said. I was driving my daughter to her boyfriend's house. About 20 mute swans were floating in the shallows near the shore of Conscience Bay in the Long Island Sound. I wondered whether, in all good conscience, I should ruin my daughter's swan swoon. ""Take a good look at them,"" I said, ""because the state plans to exterminate them."" ""What?"" she looked stricken. ""All the swans in the whole bay?"" ""All the mute swans in the whole state,"" I said. ""WHY?"" she demanded. ""They're my favorite bird."" ""The reason is, they're not native. They come from Europe. And they eat a lot of vegetation. And they're territorial, so they give some native ducks and geese a hard time. Also, during breeding season, they hiss and bluff, and that scares some people."" ""Those are stupid reasons,"" she said, demanding to know who is planning to kill them. I told her it's the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. ""You can't be serious. The department of conservation is going to kill all of my favorite birds?"" She was silent for a moment and then brightened and asked, ""Are you fooling me?"" ""Not fooling. Why are they your favorite?"" ""Well, because, I mean, they're monogamous --"" Lots of birds, actually, are monogamous. And lots of monogamous birds color outside the lines. I kept silent, like the mute swans, on this point. We were, after all, going to her boyfriend's house, and monogamy is something I support. ""-- and they're, y'know, I mean look at how graceful they look out there. And, like, they start out ugly and then grow up to be so beautiful. It's the whole ugly duckling thing. I mean, I don't have any substantial reasons; they're just my favorite."" I have favorite birds too, and I don't have any better reasons for why my favorites are my favorites. Alexandra kept staring at the swans. ""You should write something about this,"" she said. ""I should do a lot of things,"" I reminded both of us. I kind of agree with the department's main reason for exterminating New York state's resident mute swans (by the way, that's the species' name, because they're usually silent). Non-native species often pose problems. I just have two problems with the plan. One, I don't think mute swans are really too much of a threat to anything or anyone in New York state. They live mainly on Long Island and the lower Hudson, with a few on the Great Lakes. They number just around 2,200 birds, total, in the whole state. Not exactly a plague. The state says that mute swans are a problem for native waterfowl. I see native waterfowl, and their ducklings and goslings, on many of the same ponds where I see swans. Native waterfowl, by the way, that the state permits hunters to kill. Here's what hunters in New York state are allowed: ""The daily limit of 6 ducks includes all species of mergansers, and may include 4 mallards (no more than 2 of which may be hens), 1 black duck, 3 wood ducks, 2 pintail, 2 redheads, 2 scaup, 2 canvasback, 4 scoters or 2 hooded mergansers."" I'd like to know whether any mute swans kill six ducks per day or even per year. Mute swans have no direct interactions with most sea ducks -- I don't even think they compete for food -- but hunters have a ""daily limit of 7 sea ducks (scoters, eiders and long-tailed ducks) in addition to the regular duck bag in coastal waters of the Long Island Zone only."" Note italics in the state regulations: Hunters may kill extra sea ducks only if they happen to be hunting in the part of the state where the sea is. Clever. So who and what is the greater problem? And is there really a problem? Mute swans are territorial, and as near as I can tell, their own territoriality seems, in my casual observations, self-limiting. On the ponds I know, there's usually just one nesting pair. I think they themselves keep it that way by preventing other swans from nesting. The state claims that their numbers are increasing. Assuming that's true, and assuming that's a problem, why not reduce their numbers by letting hunters shoot the swans that are purportedly causing the problem for native ducks, instead of shooting native ducks? I know, of course, that such logic is dead on arrival, but I'm just sayin'. So around Long Island where mute swans are such a problem for ducks, the lucky hunter can kill a baker's dozen of ducks daily. I am getting a mental image of a lineup of people who've killed too many ducks, with a mute swan standing among them. Hmm; who's the culprit? By the way, sea ducks taste terrible to most people, and I've seen hunters kill them, collect them and throw them in the bushes. Often, they just shoot them and let them drift away on the tide. But to hear the state's explanation, you'd think that the problem for ducks is: mute swans. The only other problem I have with the plan to exterminate the swans is, that is a very stupid idea. I mean that in the most supportive sense of the word, ""stupid."" For a public agency that needs public trust and support to attack birds with which people feel a symbolic bond is unwise. Here's what I learned a long time ago by watching a venerable old conservation organization tear itself in half over an attempt to replace its much-loved generations-old logo: Never attack symbols unless you're sure you are right, you know you can win and you don't care about creating permanent enmity and resentment and alienating a lot of people. The reason mute swans were brought here from Europe is, people really like them. People like them because they look beautiful, and they look beautiful because people can actually see them. We are surrounded by literally hundreds of species of native birds, many of them absolutely stunning, that people can't see because they are too hidden, too small, you need binoculars, they're in the treetops or you have to get out of your car. ""To speak truly,"" Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""few adult persons can see nature. Most persons do not see the sun."" For them, there's mute swans. It's a start. Non-native animals are often a terrible problem for native wildlife. But not always (honey bees come to mind). There's little that can be done about zebra mussels, starlings, Japanese barberry and most invasive aliens. Yet before we exterminate the ones we can truly bully, let's be sure they're really a problem. And let's be sure that utter extermination is really the best goal. Or else, like the mute swan itself, let us hold our peace.

"(CNN) -- When is a garden not a garden? When it's an avant garden. Designers of the past -- who were concerned with verdant lawns, traditional flowerbeds and tasteful ornaments -- would barely recognize the experimental gardens of today. ""Garden design has always been quite a traditional discipline, says Madison Cox, a garden designer and part of the team behind a new book, The Gardener's Garden. ""Gardens are in a constant state of flux, and you can only do what the plants allow you to do. So it changes less rapidly than painting, sculpture or architecture, as it takes longer to experiment."" Plant vocabulary . There have been other restrictions, too. In the past, garden design was limited by the plants available, as it was difficult to access plants that did not grow indigenously. But now, says Cox, the ""plant vocabulary"" has increased. ""Go to any garden center in England, Italy, America or elsewhere, and you'll find plants from all over the world,"" he says. This -- together with the influence of radical breakthroughs in the disciplines of painting, sculpture and music -- has allowed a new generation of gardeners to create spaces that owed more to the imagination than tradition. The birth of a new experimental art form . It started with experiments like Lotusland, an extravagant garden in Santa Barbara, California that was created in the latter half of the 20th Century by Madame Ganna Walska, an eccentric opera singer. It contains exotic plants from all over the world, set in fantasy contexts. ""It's completely mad,"" says Cox. ""The section called the Blue Garden, for instance, has many blue plants and blue-colored slag from a Coca-Cola bottling plant on the ground. The effect is this weird, underwater, blue light, that is at the same time eerie and soothing."" Similarly, Marjorelle -- a public garden in Marrakech, Morocco, that attracts about 730,000 visitors a year -- showcases plants that are almost completely devoid of vivid color, and resembles a world of grays, light greens and pale blues. ""The only color comes from things that are not natural, like painted surfaces and pottery,"" says Cox. Taking design to the next level . In Kent, England, the garden that belonged to movie director Derek Jarman eschews grass and traditional trees to embrace flotsam, weeds and found objects, creating a space that is in many ways closer to a movie set than a garden. Modern experimental designers have been taking things to another level. The Red Sand Garden in the Royal Botanic Gardens in Melbourne, Australia, resembles a martian landscape, complete with rock circles, curving escarpments and striking forms and foliage. However, modern avant garde designers are not completely free from all constraints. ""In today's world, we have other pressing environmental issues, such as water conservation,"" says Cox. ""Designers need to consider what is appropriate to the specific climatic conditions they are working in. This is of vital importance."" The heart of any garden . Ultimately, he says, a garden is a garden if it represents a retreat from the world. ""In recent years there has been an explosion of creativity,"" he says, ""but we have never lost that sense that garden is a paradise, a retreat from the world, and an alternative to our normal surroundings and chaotic lives. ""That has always been the point of a garden, and that will never change."" One hundred years since the 'Golden Age' of posters began .

"(CNN) -- Two Norwegian lawmakers have jointly nominated National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden for the Nobel Peace Prize, they said Wednesday on their party website.

"(CNN) -- It was a mother's worst nightmare. On March 31, 2014, at 11 p.m., I received a phone call from my 25-year-old son. ""Mom. I got lost, made a wrong turn and ended up at the Mexico border. I've been surrounded by military, and I need you to know in case anything happens to me."" On April 1, I received another phone call. ""Mom, I've been arrested. Please get me an attorney,"" Andrew said. It was the most frightening call of my life -- worse than the call from Afghanistan as my son explained, ""We have just been hit by an IED."" The call from La Mesa Prison in Tijuana, Mexico, three days later went this way: ""Mom, I am not going to make it through the night. Whatever you do, do not come down here and ask questions or do an investigation as you will be killed as well."" As Independence Day comes and goes this year, it is bittersweet to think about my son being bound by a felony arrest in a foreign country while we try to navigate a foreign judicial system. To think about my son, vibrant and ambitious, being held in the bondage of incarceration is inconceivable. This young man who valiantly fought for the freedom of others, willing to die to combat the evil of oppression and violence in two tours in Afghanistan, meritoriously promoted to sergeant on the battlefield in 2012 -- and now he is languishing in a Mexican penitentiary and experiencing captivity for the first time, as a result of one wrong turn. It is simply staggering. He has been incarcerated since April 1, for inadvertently crossing the border with legally purchased firearms. This separation is by far more traumatic than the combat tours. Marine 'optimistic' he'll soon be released . In Afghanistan, he had his Marine Corps brothers who always had his back. I feel like our executive branch has abandoned him, and it feels totally inhumane. The White House has not responded to us despite our petition on Whitehouse.gov, which has nearly 130,000 signatures. The White House says it will respond to petitions that get 100,000 signatures in 30 days. On a trip to Mexico in May, Secretary of State John Kerry ""raised the issue"" with authorities there. I am outraged. Andrew's situation should be considered a grave, serious and urgent concern. In the past years while reading scripture, I often paused at the directive to visit those in prison. Deep in my core was the question, mingled with fear: How, who, why? Today I have learned to walk without shame, boldly and compassionately, through the corridors of bars and locks and have a newfound perspective for those imprisoned. Incarceration of a loved one is a heart-wrenching, soul-searching experience that can debilitate, consume and potentially destroy both the captive and his free loved ones. Marine tells of abuse in Mexican prison . It is a difficult journey, but there is rest to be found in understanding that God's timing is perfect. I take huge comfort in that, and this is what keeps me going and fortifies my strength and helps me to persevere when I can't see God's plan. The saying, ""Trust his heart when you can't trace his hand"" is something I really have had to implement. Through faith, I will continue choosing not to be crippled by the weight of the dismay, trauma, and disbelief associated with this, and I will be steadfast in my determination to overcome the barriers of this injustice. My strength, focus and vision come both from the Lord and from the solidarity and outreach of so many good folks on both sides of the border and around the world. I am not journeying alone as I have poured out my broken heart to so many. And it feels as if they symbolically cupped my tears and replenish me continuously with flowing waters of hope and support. I fear that my son's plight is getting lost in current events happening on the ground in Mexico, but I know that through the collective strength of prayer and the unified focus of individual Americans standing together as advocates, there will be victory for Andrew.","Mother of Marine being held in Mexico says this separation is worse than his combat tours .

"London, England (CNN) -- Queen Elizabeth II's annual budget this year is £38.2 million ($57.8 million), down from £41.5 million ($62.8 million) last year, Buckingham Palace announced Monday. That means each British person contributes about 62 pence (94 cents) a year to support the royal household. The drop comes mostly because the queen took fewer charter flights this year and refunded money to the government after selling her old helicopter, the palace said in its annual financial statement for the royal household. Her annual spending has fallen by 17 percent in real terms since 2001, the palace said. Queen Elizabeth II is worth an estimated £290 million ($446 million), making her the 245th richest person in the United Kingdom, according to The Sunday Times newspaper's annual rich list published in April. The budget does not include the cost of security provided by the army or police. The government covers the Queen's budget in exchange for her surrendering income from royal holdings, the budget report says. The budget runs from April 1, 2009 to March 31, 2010.","Queen's annual spending has fallen by 17 percent in real terms since 2001 .

"Soma, Turkey (CNN) -- The search for victims of this week's coal mine fire in Turkey is now over, with a final death toll of 301, Turkish government officials said Saturday. Authorities believe they have now recovered the bodies of all the workers who perished in the Soma mine when the fire erupted Tuesday. The investigation into what caused the deadliest disaster in Turkish mining history continues, the Natural Disaster and Emergency Coordination Directorate said. The final bodies were pulled out Saturday afternoon, Turkish Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said. However, as the recovery effort comes to an end, controversy over Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's response to the tragedy refuses to blow over. On Friday, police in the western city used tear gas, plastic pellets and a water cannon on protesters angered by the government's response. The protesters, dressed mostly in black, chanted ""Don't sleep, Soma, remember your dead!"" as they passed through city streets a few miles from the disaster site, trying to reach a statue honoring miners. Amid a rising tide of discontent, local authorities have banned protests in Soma and apparently clamped down on those taking part. Lawyers' representatives told Turkish broadcaster DHA that eight lawyers and 25 other citizens were detained Saturday. The lawyers were in town to try to help represent families of the dead miners. Abdurrahman Savas, the governer of Manisa province, where Soma is located, declined to say how many people had been detained over the protests. But he told reporters that the authorities took the decision Friday to ban rallies and demonstrations in Soma in order to maintain peace and security. He said that ""this is not to prevent freedom of expression."" Distrust of the government is running high in certain sectors of society, with some voicing doubts about the official count of those missing, while others question the fact no one has yet taken responsibility for the tragedy. Some are also critical of the authorities' use of tear gas and water cannon against demonstrators. Erdogan's missteps . Public anger has been fueled in part by Erdogan's own missteps while visiting the scene of the disaster Wednesday. First, Erdogan's comments to relatives of dead and injured miners, in which he described the disaster as par for the course in a dangerous business, were seen as highly insensitive and drew scathing criticism. Then video taken on the same day in Soma showed Erdogan telling a man ""don't be nasty,"" according to the footage aired Friday by DHA. The remarks initially reported and translated by DHA were confirmed by a CNN native Turkish speaker. ""What happened, happened. It is from God... If you boo the country's prime minister, you get slapped,"" Erdogan is heard saying. That was after another video clip emerged showing a crowd outside a grocery store angrily booing Erdogan. As the Prime Minister entered the crowded store, he appeared to put his arm around the neck of a man who was later identified as a miner. After the confrontation, the video captured what appeared to be Erdogan's security guards beating the same man to the floor. The miner said later that Erdogan slapped him, possibly by mistake. He wants an apology for the way he was treated by the Prime Minister's staff. In addition, a photograph surfaced Wednesday of an aide to Erdogan kicking a protester, an image that quickly became a symbol of the anger felt by many against the government, and amid mounting questions over safety practices at the mine. Huseyin Celik, a spokesman for the ruling Justice and Development Party, or AKP, dismissed the grocery store incident and said the image of the aide, Yusuf Yerkel, kicking the protester was misleading. Yerkel was quoted by Turkey's semiofficial Anadolu news agency Thursday as saying that he had been deeply saddened by the previous day's events. ""I am sad that I could not keep my calm in the face of all the provocation, insults and attacks that I was subjected to that day,"" he reportedly said. Questions over safety chambers . The mine complex exploded in flames for unknown reasons Tuesday -- trapping many miners deep underground. Among other issues, mine officials indicated Friday that workers may not have had access to an emergency refuge where they could have sheltered from the flames and choking fumes. Site manager Akin Celik told reporters that the mine had closed one emergency refuge when excavation work moved to a lower area. Miners were building, but had not finished, a new safety chamber at the lower level, he said. The owner of the company, Alp Gurman, said the mine met the highest standards laid out by the law in Turkey. The company, he said, had no legal obligation to build safety chambers. Asked about that issue, Minister of Labor and Social Security Faruk Celik defended Turkey's workplace safety act and said it was set up within the framework of EU regulations, according to CNN Turk. ""This is a dynamic area,"" he said, adding that it is the duty of each company to ensure workers' safety needs are met. ""Could people be sent to death because a certain sentence is not in the regulations?"" he said. Istanbul Technical University said it had dropped Gurman and a fellow Soma Holding manager, Ismet Kasapoglu, from an advisory panel in its mining faculty, following protests and an occupation by students at the university, CNN Turk reported. Yildiz, speaking to journalists earlier Saturday, when the death toll stood at 299, said 15 bodies had been recovered overnight. Most have been returned to their families but DNA testing is being carried out on the remains of 13 people, the Energy Minister said. Fumes from a new fire, a few hundred yards from the one that broke out Tuesday, hindered search and recovery efforts Saturday, Yildiz said. Initial reports said the main fire was sparked by a transformer explosion, but Celik told reporters Friday that the cause of the fire was still unknown. Asked what had happened, he said, ""We don't know either. Never seen anything like this before. We are trying to find out."" Political bonfire . Hundreds have also taken to the streets this week in anti-government protests in Istanbul and Ankara, with police answering, in some cases, with water cannons and tear gas. As Erdogan took a stroll through the city, onlookers showered him with deafening jeers as well as chants of ""Resign, Prime Minister!"" Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu defended Erdogan in an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Thursday. ""He was feeling all these pains in his heart,"" he said. ""Everybody knows that our Prime Minister is always with the people, and always feels the pain of the people. Otherwise, he wouldn't get such a high support in eight elections in (the) last 10 years."" But the disaster opened up an old political wound. Opposition politician Ozgur Ozel from the Manisa region, which includes Soma, filed a proposal in late April to investigate Turkish mines after repeated deadly accidents. Erdogan's government rejected the proposal. It claimed that the mine, owned by SOMA Komur Isletmeleri A.S., had passed recent inspections. A Turkish engineers' association criticized mine ventilation and safety equipment this week as being ""insufficient and old."" A lack of safety inspections has caused 100 coal mines to be closed in the last three years, according to Turkey's Energy Ministry. President Abdullah Gul, speaking as he visited Soma on Thursday, said he was sure the investigation already begun would ""shed light"" on what regulations are needed. ""Whatever is necessary will be done,"" he said. Despair, anger, dwindling hope after Turkey coal mine fire . Gul Tuysuz and Ivan Watson reported from western Turkey, and Laura Smith-Spark wrote and reported from London. CNN's Diana Magnay, Talia Kayali and Ben Brumfield contributed to this report.","Search efforts are now over with a confirmed death toll of 301, government officials say .

"(CNN) -- You insisted the first Jeff Gordon wild-driving viral video was a fake. What do you think of the second one, Travis Okulski? Oh, this one is ""unequivocally, one hundred percent, totally, absolutely real,"" he says. How would he know? Because he's in it, the victim of a prank and Gordon's revenge. A year ago, Okulski called out Gordon on the Jalopnik auto blog after the millions of views for a video in which Gordon dons a disguise and takes a supposedly unsuspecting car salesman for a high-speed test drive. It's one of those commercials masking itself as a video that begs the question: Is it fake? Okulski led the ""it's obviously staged"" camp. So Pepsi and Gordon decided to exact revenge. They tempted him into coming to North Carolina by promising an exclusive test drive in a highly anticipated new Corvette. Then they dressed Gordon up in a new disguise with a neck tattoo, sideburns, mullet covered by a camouflage hat and sent him over in a fake cab (with real markings) to pick Okulski up at the hotel. Gordon's cover story was that he's just out of prison after 10 years, so when a highway patrol officer pulls them over, the ""cab driver"" decides he cannot go back to the joint. And, despite the protests of Okulski, the chase is on. As the car tears through an industrial complex, Okulski screams in the back seat and begs the driver to stop. ""I'm gonna lose this guy,"" Gordon says as he winds and slides over asphalt. ""This never works. This never works!"" Okulski replies. Finally the car skids into the open door of a warehouse where the folks from Pepsi await. As of Thursday evening, the video, ""Test Drive 2,"" had 1,000,000 views in just a few hours. Test Drive, meanwhile, now has almost 41 million views. Okluski wrote on a blog post on how he fell for the cab gag. ""I thought I was going to die,"" he wrote. ""I yelled, I banged the glass, I actually tried to kick through the Plexiglas window between the driver and me. I pulled out my phone to call 911 but couldn't keep it steady enough to dial."" He insists this video was definitely real. But is it? Is the video that proves the fake video isn't a fake actually a fake, too? The conspiracy theories have already begun. Keep your eye on the car, the naysayers say. Something changes on the car. And it looks like someone has driven the course before. Multiple takes, they wonder? That's aside from the questions about how did he get fooled, not figure out the cab was fake, not see the cameras, not realize it was Jeff Gordon. ""Looking back on it now, I'm not sure how I didn't guess beforehand, but it boils down to the fact that I had no reason to believe anything was off,"" he said. Or was it? What do you think?","Auto blogger Travis Okulski made Jeff Gordon mad when he said a popular video was fake .

"(CNN) -- Billionaire Richard Branson's planned commercial spacecraft had a successful test flight Thursday, rocketing into the skies over California after being dropped from its carrier plane, his company announced. Branson's Virgin Galactic said SpaceShipTwo broke the sound barrier, climbed from 42,000 feet to 69,000 feet over the Mojave Desert under rocket power and descended using its tilt-wing ""feathering"" maneuver. It's the second powered flight for SpaceShipTwo, which is designed to carry up to six passengers on what will be suborbital flights at first. ""In addition to achieving the highest altitude and greatest speed to date, the test flight demonstrated the vehicle's full technical mission profile in a single flight for the first time ... All of the test objectives were successfully completed,"" the company said. In a video showing highlights of Thursday's test flight, Branson said Virgin Galactic plans to start taking passengers aloft in 2014 -- a slight delay from the December 2013 marker he set down at Britain's Farnborough International Airshow in June. ""Virgin Galactic is now gearing up for the commercial service, finalizing cabin interiors, flight suits, training programs and the multiple other details required to offer hundreds of aspiring astronauts a safe and awe-inspiring journey,"" he said. More than 500 would-be astronauts, including actor Ashton Kutcher, have so far signed up for the two-hour, $200,000-a-seat flights. Virgin executives have said they expect to have 600 bookings in the first two years of service.

"Johannesburg (CNN) -- Nelson Mandela has been discharged from the Pretoria hospital where he had been receiving treatment since June, the South African president's office said Sunday. He will continue his recovery at home. ""Madiba's condition remains critical and is at times unstable,"" President Jacob Zuma's office said, referring to the revered leader's clan name. ""Nevertheless, his team of doctors are convinced that he will receive the same level of intensive care at his Houghton home that he received in Pretoria."" Mandela posters mark his 95th birthday . Mandela, 95, was hospitalized June 8 because of a lung infection. He marked his July birthday at the Pretoria hospital where he has been surrounded by relatives. ""During his stay in hospital from the 8th of June 2013, the condition of our former President vacillated between serious to critical and at times unstable,"" the office said. ""Despite the difficulties imposed by his various illnesses, he, as always, displays immense grace and fortitude."" There was some confusion Saturday when two sources close to Mandela said he had returned home -- only to be contradicted by the president's office, which said he was still hospitalized. ""The family mistakenly thought Mandela had been taken to his Johannesburg home early Saturday morning,"" the source then told CNN. Why Nelson Mandela has six names . The frail icon has not appeared in public for years, but he retains his popularity as the father of democracy and emblem of the nation's fight against apartheid. Mandela became an international figure while enduring 27 years in prison for fighting against apartheid, the country's system of racial segregation. He became the nation's first black president in 1994, four years after he was freed from prison. Mandela's impact extends far beyond South African borders. After he left office, he mediated conflicts in Africa and the Middle East. His history of lung problems dates to his imprisonment on Robben Island, and he has battled respiratory infections since then.","Mandela, 95, had been hospitalized since June .

"(CNN) -- It's hard to engineer this kind of creepy serendipity. Earlier this week, European Union data watchdogs, fighting to protect our privacy in an age of big data, put pressure on Google over the privacy of user information. Just 48 hours later, Google potentially struck a new blow against privacy when it posted a video preview of its new ""Glass"" technology -- high-tech spectacles featuring a revolutionary digital interface that enable its wearers to not only view the world through Google's eyes but also automatically photograph all that they see. ""How strange is that!"" CNN's Erin Burnett exclaimed after a contemplating a ""world seen through Google Glasses"". Strange indeed. But these glasses, a kind of digital surrogate for our eyes, are strange in a creepy, Hitchcockian, ""Rear Window"" sort of way. Or the same way that Big Brother's ubiquitous cameras were strange in George Orwell's ""Nineteen Eighty Four."" And in the same way that a future in which ""promethean"" data companies like Google rule the world now appears strange. The coincidental timing of last week's EU and Google announcements may have been unintentional, but it sure is ominous. Read related: How it will feel to wear Google Glass . The EU is concerned about the way in which Google has, since last March, been pooling the data of its individual users across its popular services like search, Gmail, Google+ and YouTube in order to bundle them up for advertisers. Its anxiety over this aggregation of our personal information is twofold. Firstly, Google has done little, if anything, to inform users of this unilateral change. Secondly, Google hasn't offered users a way of opting out. Google insists its privacy policies respect European laws and simply help enhance user experiences. But in the eyes of the EU, those of us using products like YouTube, Gmail or Google+ are being, to borrow a Microsoft coined neologism, ""Scroogled"" by Google's new privacy policy. Last October, EU watchdogs gave Google four months to revise this policy. But last week, after nothing appeared to have changed, Brussels raised its warning a bureaucratic notch, promising to take action against Google by the summer. And yet, in light of Google Glass, the EU's concerns seem like a quaint throwback to a more innocent digital age. Watchdogs should, of course, be barking madly at Google's decision to pool our data for its advertising clients. Regardless of the legitimacy of such practices, I'm strongly in favor of making Google accountable, both legally and morally, for policies that so patently disregard the privacy of its users. But Google Glass opens an entirely new front in the digital war against privacy. These spectacles, which have been specifically designed to record everything we see, represent a developmental leap in the history of data that is comparable to moving from the bicycle to the automobile. It is the sort of radical transformation that may actually end up completely destroying our individual privacy in the digital 21st century. Read related: From 3D graphics to biometric scans: How your smartphone will get smarter . While none of us were looking, Google -- the most data-hungry of today's digital giants -- is reengineering mobile technology. Thanks to Silicon Valley's mad rush to develop wearable computing, it isn't alone. Apple is supposedly working on its hotly-anticipated wristwatch and wearable personal data devices from companies like Nike and Fitbit are already beginning to revolutionize the healthcare industry. But there's something particularly troubling about Google Glass. When we put on these surveillance devices, we all become spies, or scrooglers, of everything and everyone around us. By getting us to wear their all seeing digital eyeglasses, Google are metamorphosing us into human versions of those Street View vans -- now thankfully banned in Germany -- which crawl, like giant cockroaches, around our cities documenting our homes. Neither Orwell nor Hitchcock at their most terrifyingly dystopian could have dreamt up Google Glass. According to Google co-founder Sergey Brin, quoted by tech website Mashable, ""Glass will also have an automatic picture-taking mode, snapping pics at a preset intervals (such as every 5 seconds)."" Pics every 5 seconds! Gulp. So where will all that intimate data go? Erin Burnett's strange ""world seen through Google Glasses"" is actually, as another leading tech site Techcrunch notes ""the world seen through Google's omnipresent eye."" And the terabytes of data sucked up every five seconds by its omniscient glasses will, of course, flow to Google. That's the whole business model, the very raison d'etre of Google Glass. Those pics every 5 seconds will be used to aggregate data and then to generate billions of dollars of revenue by selling advertising around it. One EU complaint about current Google practice, you'll remember, was about the absence of an opt out button to enable users to say no to Google's pooling of their data. But the problem of saying no, of opting out, becomes even more problematic with Google Glass. After all, as these Warby Parker or Ray-Ban-designed devices become more fashionable (ie: innocuous), most of us won't even know if we are being filmed when gazed at by a bespectacled stranger. In pictures: 12 futuristic phone concepts . The EU watchdogs also objected to Google's current pooling of our data in a single personalized record. And Google Glass could, I fear, become the focal point for all our data in a world where privacy no longer exists. ""Everything, from Google searches to notifications to hangouts, seemingly happens in this one space,"" notes Techcrunch about the spectacles. Google Glass, thus, may become the pivotal post PC, post iPod and post tablet device. A pooling of all our most intimate data, a mirror of ourselves -- the holy grail, of course, for advertisers. I remarked earlier that it's hard to engineer this creepy kind of serendipity. But I may have been wrong. You see, the whole point of Google Glass is actually to successfully engineer serendipity. The creepier, the better. After all, when we wear these devices, those clever engineers at Google will know where we are all the time. So what's to stop them serving up personalized advertisements for products when the gaze of our glasses rest upon those products? At the very moment we look at those new clothes in that store window, a special offer for the clothes will flash up on the digital interface of our Google Glass. How serendipitous, eh? But what to do? Is there an antidote to Google's eyewear? Google Glass is currently in being tested with plans for a finished product to be released into the mass market next year. Last week, Google announced that a few prototype models of the spectacles would go on sale for the not exactly bargain price of $1,500. To qualify, well-heeled Google fanboys need to go to their Google+ or Twitter accounts and, in 50 words or less, using the hashtag #ifihadglass, explain how they would use Google Glass. So, if anyone at Google happens to be reading this, here's my application: . #ifihadglass: I would make data privacy its default feature. Nobody else sees the data I see unless I explicitly say so. Not advertisers, nor the government, and certainly not those engineers of the human soul at the Googleplex. No, Google Glass must be opaque. For my eyes only. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Andrew Keen.","Google Glass spectacles could offer tech giant new ways of harvesting data, says Andrew Keen .

"(CNN) -- When they can see the world, save cash and get that surgery you wanted, it's no wonder that increasing numbers of travelers are hopping on a jet in search of cut-price healthcare. The worldwide medical tourism industry is said to be growing by up to 25% each year as patients with passports head abroad for procedures costing as much as 80% less than at home. Partly fueled by 1.2 million Americans, it's a sector now estimated to be worth up to $55 billion. But where are the best destinations for medical tourism? Last month, the UK-based International Medical Travel Journal staged its first annual award ceremony recognizing what it says are the top facilities offering treatment to visitors. While many of these establishments offer care for potentially life-threatening cancer or heart problems, patients are just as likely to be seeking cosmetic work to their face, teeth or torso. IMTJ's managing editor Keith Pollard says the awards, staged in Dubai, are the industry's first independent stamps of approval on medical tourism providers. Airline travel discounts part of package . ""All our winners exemplify the way the medical tourism industry should be run -- professional, offering exceptional patient care and providing the best possible medical outcomes,"" Pollard says. The IMTJ divided its winners into categories, including best hospital, specialist patient center, dental clinic, fertility clinic, travel agency and website. Malaysia emerged as one of the prime destinations, with victories in three categories. Gleneagles Kuala Lumpur, a 330-bed care center that offers airline travel discounts to inbound patients on its website, took the hospital accolade. Kuala Lumpur's Prince Court Medical Center won best fertility clinic, while its International Dental Specialist Center was named as the best place for teeth tuneups. Jordan was named as the best overall destination for what judges said was a remarkable success in handling 250,000 international patients.

"(CNN) -- Violence in Mexico is back in the news and so is the perennial question: Is Mexico safe? In just the last few weeks there have been stories of 12 young people allegedly abducted in daylight from a Mexico City club; the death by beating of Malcolm X's grandson, also in the capital; the kidnapping of a U.S. Marine reservist from his father's ranch; the freeing of 165 people, including two pregnant women, who had been held prisoner; and the case of an Arizonan mom traveling on a bus who was arrested and jailed, accused of smuggling drugs. That's all before you look at the staggering toll of the years-long war between security forces and drug cartels -- at least 60,000 people killed in drug-related violence from 2006 to 2012, according to Human Rights Watch. Other observers put the number even higher. Disappearances in Mexico City linked to gang . Outside of war zones, more Americans have been killed in Mexico in the last decade than in any other country outside the United States, and the number of U.S. deaths jumped from 35 in 2007 to 113 in 2011. But those numbers do not lead to any simple conclusion. Millions of Americans visit Mexico every year without incident, and the number of tourists continues to grow. Nearly 6 million U.S. citizens visited Mexico in 2012, according to data from Mexico's tourism ministry. The first quarter of 2013 has seen a 5.9% uptick in American tourists compared to a year before, the ministry reported. Analysts and travel experts agree that security in Mexico varies -- sometimes dramatically -- from place to place. It's a contradiction -- Mexico is both as dangerous as ever or as safe as ever, depending on one's destination, actions and common sense. ""I think what you see in Mexico over the past few years is this movable target of what's safe and what's not safe,"" said Shannon K. O'Neil, senior fellow for Latin America studies at the Council for Foreign Relations. Of course you can be hurt anywhere, but the risks are different for a business trip to the capital, seeking sun and sand in Cancun or visiting family across the border. Mexico City caution . Residents of Mexico City were gripped this week by the disappearance of 12 young people from an after-hours bar in a popular entertainment district. The families of the missing, one only 16 years old, allege that they were kidnapped in broad daylight by an armed group. Investigators have confirmed that the group was at the Heavens After nightclub, but the case remains shrouded in mystery: There was no sign of an armed group or of a struggle at the scene, officials said. The incident grabbed attention because it was a particularly brazen crime for the nation's massive capital. Throughout the violence spawned by the drug war, Mexico City remained a relatively safe place, not immune, but not awash in gangland violence. Twenty years ago, the city had a reputation as a dangerous place, but successive local administrations have made it safe for residents and visitors. Analyst O'Neil points out that there is a large police and security camera presence to keep it that way. ""Even if there was this wave of organized crime coming in, the law enforcement capacity in Mexico City is much higher than in other parts of the country,"" she said. Malcolm Shabazz, grandson of Malcolm X, died last month after suffering an apparent beating in Mexico City. Many of the details of his night out remain unknown, but he had been at a bar one block south of Plaza Garibaldi, a rough but famous patch of the capital known for its mariachis. Those who know the city say that, just like any other major metropolis, there are areas that visitors should stay away from at certain hours. ""Physical safety if you are in the main tourist areas and you are sensible is not a problem,"" in Mexico City, said John Bailey, professor emeritus at Georgetown University who has researched public security in Mexico. ""Bad things happen to good people, but that's just a small fraction."" The State Department has issued no travel advisories for Mexico City. Opinion: In Mexico, guilty till proven innocent . Safe at the beach . The majority of the millions of Americans who visit Mexico head to resort cities along its coasts. The most popular destinations, according to Mexican officials, are Cancun, Riviera Maya, Los Cabos, and Puerto Vallarta. And while it's impossible to separate completely the parts of Mexico on drug routes from where tourists go, there is a level of separation, O'Neil said. Drug trafficking may happen in Cancun just like anywhere else, but the tourist areas are typically safe, she said. 3 undeniable reasons to explore Mexico . One thing the tourist destinations have in common, besides beaches, is that none is the subject of a travel advisory. Jill Noble, owner of Cruise Therapy Travel Co. in Texas, staunchly defends Mexico as a safe destination. ""I've never felt threatened in any way, and that's what I tell my clients,"" she said. She blames the media for focusing on the negative and provoking fear in would-be travelers. That's all that people read about, Noble said. ""I've seen more paranoia, for sure,"" she said. ""But it'll pass."" Once her clients vacation in Mexico, they come back and wonder why they were scared at all in the first place, she said. By the numbers: U.S.-Mexico relations . Border remains an unknown . Two of the recent incidents that garnered headlines -- the jailing of Yanira Maldonado, accused of smuggling marijuana, and the search for missing Marine reservist Armando Torres III -- took place near the border. The area where Mexico abuts the United States is culturally unique and sees hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of cross-border trade pass by on trucks. But the proximity to the United States makes many border cities key to illegal markets as well. Drug cartels fighting for lucrative smuggling routes engage in turf battles that can turn cities into war zones. Nuevo Laredo experienced this in the mid-2000s, and later, Juarez suffered the same. Some things are changing. The number of killings in Juarez, across the border from El Paso, has dropped enough for the city to shed the title ""Murder Capital of the World."" (San Pedro Sula, in northwest Honduras, has topped that list for the last two years.) Brazen daylight shootings and mass killings farther south in the state of Tamaulipas, across from where Texas hits the Gulf of Mexico, are no longer in the news. But that does not mean all is well. Rape case in Mexican resort city puts violence back in the spotlight . ""Tamaulipas is under the control of criminal groups,"" said Bailey, the professor with expertise in Mexican public security. The cartels may not be having daily shootouts in the streets, but the risks for those who venture to the wrong place at the wrong time persist, he said. Arizonan Maldonado was arrested in the northwestern state of Sonora after the bus she was riding was searched at a military checkpoint. Soldiers claimed to have found 12 pounds of marijuana under her seat and detained her. A very public campaign by her family put pressure on a judge to release her, which he did after a video showed that she did not board the bus with the illicit bundles. Buses have previously been targeted by criminal groups for extortion and kidnapping. In 2011, the U.S. Consulate in Matamoros, across the border from Brownsville, Texas, issued a warning against bus travel after at least three reports by Americans that their buses were boarded by criminals. In at least one case, the male bus passengers, including one U.S. citizen, were forcibly removed and went missing. In Tamaulipas this week, authorities freed 165 migrants apparently kidnapped and held, possibly for ransom. The State Department has issued a travel warning for visitors to ""defer nonessential travel"" to most areas of Mexico's border states. Overall, Georgetown's Bailey said travel to Mexico is safer today than two years ago. But it has a lot to do with one's common sense and a twist on the old adage -- not so much who you know but where you go and what you do. ""Americans,"" Bailey said, ""have a gift for finding trouble if they're looking for it.""","Recent abductions and violence have put security in Mexico back in the news .
Yet millions visit Mexico every year without incident .
Safety varies dramatically depending where you are and what you do ."
"(CNN) -- Casually warming up on the mat, Yana Kudryavtseva slips into a pose that would leave a contortionist gasping in admiration. One leg keeping her upright and the other pointing toward the ceiling, her torso arches back at a mind-boggling angle while her head rests behind the supporting thigh, with both hands on the floor. It's more ""Matrix"" than ""Blade Runner"" -- but there are no special effects here. ""My dad was rather reluctant to let me do this sport, as he knew how hard it would be,"" the 16-year-old rhythmic gymnastics champion tells CNN's Human to Hero series. Aleksey Kudryavtsev, in fact, knows all about the rigors of being an international athlete. A swimmer, he was part of Russia's 4 x 200 meters freestyle relay team that won gold at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. ""I got into rhythmic gymnastics when I was four years old. My dad brought me there,"" Yana recalls. ""He knew my future coach, so when he brought me to meet her, she told him I have to start training. ""She also convinced my dad that I have to go into gymnastics. Eventually he let me do the training to improve my flexibility, body posture and body shape. As it turned out, this sport has actually become my entire life."" And Kudryavtseva has made her father proud. This year, while still just 15, she became the youngest rhythmic gymnast to ever win the all-around title at the World Championships, in Kiev in late August. Rhythmic gymnastics -- ""a beautiful and womanly sport,"" says Kudryavtseva -- incorporates balls, clubs, hoops and ribbons in its performance. ""For a gymnast to be successful, she needs to strike a balance of everything within herself. She needs to be graceful, flexible, perform all elements, turns, maintain co-ordination -- she has to have all of that. ""If, for example, she only has co-ordination and nothing else, she will not succeed."" The world title was but a small step on the way to her main goal, an Olympic gold medal, and she is quick to reject suggestions that rhythmic gymnastics is not worthy of the Summer Games status it was given in 1984. ""Some of the authorities would like to remove rhythmic gymnastics from the list of Olympic sports and turn it into art. I think this would be wrong, as rhythmic gymnastics is a true sport -- we train around six hours per day, and sometimes spend entire days in the gym."" Ask Yana which of the four disciplines she prefers, and you will get the kind of look most people would give when told to give up air or water. ""I love them all and cannot lay emphasis on any of them. I might offend one of them!"" she retorts. That sort of focus comes from years of dedicated training, but Kudryavtseva does not believe she has missed out on a normal childhood. ""I cannot say I sacrificed anything. I train for myself, to achieve sports goals, and I do not sacrifice anything,"" she says. ""Rhythmic gymnastics is my life, everything I currently need. When I am performing, I feel something very special -- something which the audience can never feel."" Nicknamed the ""Crystal Statuette"" and famous for her ball-spinning tricks as well as her spectacular ribbon routines, Kudryavtseva is continuing Russia's dominance of the sport over the past decade. ""Russia is full of very good gymnasts. Even the substitutes' bench is full of very professional gymnasts, and competition is high,"" she says. ""Even those gymnasts who do not represent the country at competitions are still very high-level professionals and if I would have to compete with them, it would be tough."" Kudryavtseva's first mentor was Elena Karpushenko, and now they work under the supervision of national coach Irina Viner -- the wife of Russia's richest man Alisher Usmanov, and the trainer of multiple Olympic champions. ""We are on good terms with Irina Alexandrovna. We sometimes have conflicts with a coach, as all gymnasts do, but in general we have a good relationship,"" Yana says. Together they choose the music and work on the choreography at the elite Novogorsk training center based outside Kudryavtseva's home city Moscow. ""There are different levels of difficulty of elements,"" she explains. ""If co-ordination is good, it is easier to learn difficult elements. In my case it usually takes one or two weeks to learn new difficult elements."" Despite having achieved so much at a young age, she says her coaches have kept her humble. ""I cannot say I have accomplished really a lot. Like Irina Alexandrovna Viner says: ""When you're on the victory podium, you're a queen, but when you come down from it, you're nobody.' ""You cannot be too proud of yourself. I am just like my teammates, we're all equal.""

"(CNN) -- Union organizers in the South suffered a setback Friday when workers at the Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, voted against being represented by the United Auto Workers. The vote was 712 against the union and 626 in favor. There are about 1,550 hourly workers at the plant who were eligible to vote. The vote was seen as the UAW's best chance to organize a nonunion auto plant, because Volkswagen management did not oppose the effort. ""We commend Volkswagen for...trying to provide an atmosphere of freedom to make a decision,"" said UAW Region 8 Director Gary Casteel, who directs the union's Southern organizing. ""Unfortunately, politically motivated third parties threatened the economic future of this facility."" Organizers faced strong opposition by Republican officials who wanted to maintain Tennessee's reputation as a non-union state in order to attract new businesses. U.S. Senator Bob Corker, a Republican and former mayor of Chattanooga, praised the 'no' vote. ""Needless to say, I am thrilled for the employees at Volkswagen and for our community and its future,"" Corker said in a statement on his website. Corker had been heavily involved in negotiations with VW that lead the automaker to pick the town for its factory, according to the Senator's website. The plant, which opened in 2011, is Volkswagen's only U.S. plant. But automakers from Asia and Europe have opened more than 30 U.S. plants to serve the U.S. market, and more than two-thirds of those plants are in the South. Volkswagen said it was neutral on the vote, but opponents of the union had also criticized the company for being too welcoming of the union organizing effort. Volkswagen wants to establish a so-called ""works council"" at the plant, in which management and hourly workers together come up with ways to make the plant's operations more efficient. The automaker has works councils at virtually every plant it operates around the world. But there were doubts about whether the council could be set up under U.S. labor law without a union being in place. Volkswagen said it will try to move ahead with a works council, despite the outcome of the vote. ""Our employees have not made a decision that they are against a works council. Throughout this process, we found great enthusiasm for the idea,"" said Frank Fischer, CEO of Volkswagen Chattanooga. ""Our goal continues to be to determine the best method for establishing a works council in accordance with the requirements of U.S. labor law."" Union opponents blame the UAW for problems at U.S. automakers, two of which, General Motors and Chrysler Group, needed federal bailouts and bankruptcy reorganization in 2009. But GM, Chrysler and Ford Motor, the other UAW-represented automaker, are all posting strong profits today. Workers at the VW plant make roughly $19 an hour, compared with about $26 to $28 an hour for veteran hourly workers at the Detroit automakers, although new hires at the unionized plants are making closer to $17. But unionized workers are usually better paid than their non-union counterparts. Labor Department statistics show that the typical weekly wage of a unionized worker in the private sector is $892 a week, or a little more than $46,000 a year. That's 20% more than their nonunion counterparts. Experts suggested that this loss is a serious blow to the UAW's efforts to reverse the long-term decline in its membership. ""This is a setback that will resonate throughout the South and, likely, around the world,"" said Jack Nerad, executive editorial director at Kelley Blue Book. ""In VW the union had management that seemed neutral to positive toward its attempt to organize the plant's workers, and it still failed to gain certification. The UAW's attempts to organize other nonunion plants are very unlikely to be greeted with as much cooperation from other manufacturers, so this could mark the end to UAW hopes to gain traction in these nonunion Southern state plants."" As far as VW's hope to have a works council, that will be difficult to set up anytime soon, according to Donald Schroeder, a management-side labor lawyer with Mintz Levin. There can't be another union representation election at the plant for at least a year and U.S. labor law has significant barriers to these kinds of labor-management committees without an independent union. ""It will be virtually impossible for them to replicate the kinds of council they have in Germany,"" he said.","Union organizers in the South suffered a setback Friday .

"(CNN) -- In case you haven't heard, nothing worthwhile will happen in Washington until after the midterm elections. That's the conventional wisdom anyway, where the thinking is that a bitterly divided Congress will be lucky to name a post office, let alone deal with pressing issues like the budget or jobs. The conventional wisdom is wrong. On Wednesday, something important is happening in Washington. On that day, a bipartisan group featuring dozens of members of Congress, state and local leaders and business, citizen and community leaders is gathering at the No Labels National Ideas Meeting to kick off a yearlong process to set a path for where America needs to go and how we get there. This isn't the type of gathering you'd expect six weeks out from an election. These days, members of the two parties barely talk, let alone work with one another. To crib an old Bill Murray line from ""Ghostbusters"": the sight of Democrats and Republicans actually meeting together may cause mass hysteria. The subject of debate will be No Labels' National Strategic Agenda, which sets a framework for action on four goals chosen with input from a nationwide survey that No Labels conducted last fall: Create 25 million new jobs over the next 10 years; balance the federal budget by 2030; secure Medicare and Social Security for the next 75 years; and make America energy-secure by 2024. The process to create No Labels' National Strategic Agenda has been endorsed by over 80 members of Congress, and it's coming together with an entirely original approach. This is not just another policy plan. In fact, at this point, the National Strategic Agenda isn't a policy plan at all, because its details will be filled in over the next year -- with input from people across America. This agenda will be developed in a step-by-step fashion that solves problems the way they should be solved. The way we tried to solve problems when we served as the governors of Utah and West Virginia. At the National Ideas Meeting, participants will join working groups (with a member of Congress in each group) to focus on one of the four signature goals, progress to agreement on the fundamental facts, and conclude by agreeing on broad policy principles that can inform the creation of specific policy and legislative solutions. Subsequent meetings in New Hampshire, Iowa and elsewhere will take a similar approach. The effort will culminate on October 5, 2015, when the fully formed National Strategic Agenda will be unveiled in New Hampshire and Iowa. No Labels will work to inject the agenda into the emerging presidential debate by activating our network of citizens, members of Congress, and state and local leaders. The ultimate aim of this exercise is for the next president and the next Congress to use the National Strategic Agenda as a basis for bipartisan action. Like everything No Labels has proposed since its launch in December 2010, the National Strategic Agenda will be a product of discussion and agreement from every part of the political spectrum. We don't for a moment underestimate how hard it will be for a future Congress and president to coalesce around even one of these goals. But difficulty is no excuse for inaction. For too long, Washington has been a place defined by all tactics, and no strategy. We spend all our time focused on winning the day, the week or the next election, and in the process, we've lost sight of doing what's necessary for America to win the future. With the National Strategic Agenda, No Labels is bringing a unity of purpose that has been missing in our government. We're not just identifying what needs to be done. We've developed a rigorous process for how it gets done. To the many millions of Americans who are wondering what, if anything, they can do to fix the dysfunction in our government, this is your chance to get involved. These National Strategic Agenda meetings could be coming to a town near you, and you can help determine what is in the final plan. If you can't make a meeting, you can still work to ensure that candidates and members of Congress endorse the National Strategic Agenda. This is no time to let frustration with the political process lead you to tune out. Because America is facing a fork in the road. We can continue the partisan fighting and failures of the last decade. Or we can choose a different path. Our leaders can come together around a shared vision to deliver good jobs, a balanced budget, peace of mind for our seniors and energy security. We've done it before. We can do it again.","A group of Republicans, Democrats, independents looks to shape a national agenda .

"(CNN) -- America's foreign policy has gone into a tailspin. Almost every major initiative from the Obama administration has run into sharp, sometimes embarrassing, reverses. The U.S. looks weak and confused on the global stage. This might come as happy news to some opponents of the administration who enjoy seeing Barack Obama fail, but it shouldn't. America's failure in international strategy is a disaster-in-the-making for its allies and for the people who see the U.S. model of liberal democracy as one worth emulating in their own nations. There is no question that Obama was dealt a difficult hand. He came to office after America's international standing was battered by the unpopular Iraq war launched by George W. Bush. Since then, countless events outside of Washington's control have presented the White House with options ranging in many cases from bad to worse, and problems that had no good solution. Still, trying to count the ways in which foreign policy has gone badly for Obama makes for a stunningly long list. Relations with Russia have fallen off a cliff, making the theatrical ""reset"" of 2009 look, frankly, cringe-worthy. No, it's not all Obama's fault. Putin has sought to belittle the U.S. and humiliate Obama personally, a man he reportedly despises, as part of his campaign to build up his authoritarian rule at home. Obama just canceled a summit meeting after Putin -- incredibly, posing as the great defender of freedom -- granted asylum to NSA leaker Edward Snowden despite the very public pleas from Washington, which only made the U.S. look more powerless. You might confuse the times with the old Cold War days, but back then the U.S. looked mighty -- one of two awe-inspiring superpowers. The U.S. doesn't exactly inspire awe anymore. Obama dramatically warned Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, as he slaughtered his people by the thousands, that if he used chemical or biological weapons, he would cross a ""red line."" The line was crossed and not much happened. Syria is crumbling, self-destructing in a civil war that I, for one, believe could have turned out quite differently if Washington had offered material and diplomatic support for moderates in the opposition. Fears that the opposition would be dominated by extremists became a self-fulfilling prophecy. Syria's war has sucked in Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah militia, taking Lebanon to the edge of disaster and making Iran a major player in a war for the survival of the anti-American Shiite axis -- Iran-Syria-Hezbollah -- while the U.S., to all appearances, stands helplessly on the sidelines. But it is Egypt where America's foreign policy fiasco is most visible. It was in Cairo in 2009, where the newly elected Obama, still reflecting the glow of sky-high expectations, launched his campaign to repair relations with the so-called ""Muslim World."" His landmark ""New Beginning"" speech in Egypt was cited by the committee that awarded Obama the Nobel Peace prize. Nobody knew what would happen in Cairo's Tahrir Square a few years later. But today, the same people who yearned for democracy despise Washington. When Egyptians elected a Muslim Brotherhood president, Washington tried to act respectfully, but it showed a degree of deference to the Muslim Brotherhood that ignored the ways in which the group violated not only Egyptians' but America's own standards of decency and rule of law. As tensions in Egypt grow between Islamists on one side and the military and anti-Islamists on the other, there is one sentiment shared by all: Both sides feel betrayed by Washington. Egypt's most powerful man, Gen. Abdel Fatah al-Sissi, said, ""You [the U.S.] left the Egyptians; you turned your back on the Egyptians, and they won't forget that."" The awkward dance around whether to call Egypt's overthrow of President Mohamed Morsy a coup made Washington look dishonest and incompetent, especially when Secretary of State John Kerry accidentally went off script during an interview in Pakistan, saying the military was ""restoring democracy."" Just as the Arab uprisings were unfolding, the U.S. announced a major new policy, the ""pivot"" to Asia, with new attention to China's rising power. But the pivot proved premature. The Middle East demanded American attention with increasing urgency. Then there's al Qaeda, all but given up for dead, now apparently resurrected. More than a dozen U.S. embassies stand shuttered across the Middle East and Africa, the world's last remaining superpower symbolically cowering behind locked gates. The scare came from what could be counted as a victory for U.S. intelligence, reportedly the result of communications surveillance. And yet, one wonders whether telling the world that the U.S. successfully listened in on al Qaeda's leaders isn't an absurd mistake. But Washington is on the defensive, trying to explain to the world that the surveillance is still necessary. Everyone, it seems, is angry at the U.S. after Snowden's revelations of NSA spying. Even Germany, one of America's closest friends, cannot hide its irritation. Bolivia is furious after the presidential plane was forced to land on suspicions that Snowden was aboard. America's diplomatic disaster is the result of ham-handed efforts to please all sides, compounded by a failure to explain America's position in a coherent way. In fact, there is no driving idea behind the country's foreign policy. What does America stand for in the world today, can anyone answer that question? The problem, ironically, is tailor-made for none other than President Obama. Although there is no denying that he bears the brunt of the responsibility for the problem, he is someone who has shown a talent for distilling overarching ideas from competing narratives. It is time for a real reset, for a pivot. It is time for Obama to spend some time thinking about what America stands for, what its goals are and then explain it in a clear and credible way. Even if we disagree with his conclusions, at least there will be a North Star guiding his policies. Obama's supporters and his critics should hope he can pull America forward.

"(CNN) -- In a place accustomed to tough stretches, this has been a particularly tough few days at the White House. After emerging from the showdown over the Republican-led government shutdown relatively unscathed, the Obama administration finds itself under assault on three fronts: problems surrounding Obamacare, the revelations of the U.S. spying on allies, and the 2012 attack on the U.S diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, the latter for which a senator has threatened to hold up all of the Obama administration's nominations. The controversies are sure to fuel continued Republican attacks on President Barack Obama and his Democratic allies as the nation gears up for midterm elections next year, and the White House has portrayed the attacks as so much partisan chatter. But to CNN senior political analyst David Gergen, they reflect the relative inexperience of the Obama White House. ""This is an administration that has been very, very good at its politics, but has never been very good at execution of policies from Day One,"" he said Monday. ""It's an administration which has some really smart people in it, and a lot of younger people. It doesn't have very many heavyweights."" The worst part for Obama may be figuring out what to do about it all -- not just the various individual fires, but more generally how to ""take control of his own government,"" CNN chief political analyst Gloria Borger said. If you're the President, how do you make sure that subordinates aren't withholding information you should know? How do you strike the right balance, and explain it clearly, on things such as gathering intelligence versus maximizing privacy and protecting key relationships? And how do you make sure those tied to your administration avoid big missteps that could come back to bite you? ""Four out of five Americans have little or no trust in their government to do anything right,"" Borger writes in an analysis. ""And now Obama probably feels the same way."" Does Obama still have faith in government? Here are the latest details on the issues causing the administration the most heartache today: . Obamacare . Another week, another congressional hearing on the problem-plagued rollout of Obama's health insurance program. This time, Marilyn Tavenner, head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services -- which is in charge of the Obamacare website -- became the first administration official to formally apologize to Americans for the troublesome start. She offered the apology Tuesday in an appearance before the House Ways and Means Committee. ""We know that consumers are eager to purchase this coverage, and to the millions of Americans who have attempted to use Healthcare.gov to shop and enroll in health care coverage, I want to apologize to you that the website has not worked as well as it should,"" she told lawmakers. Obamacare website administrator apologizes . The website, which would-be applicants have found difficult to use, at best, embarrassingly crashed over the weekend, leaving consumers completely locked out. Then, the White House found itself on the defensive over revelations that, despite claims to the contrary by the Obama administration, some who have purchased insurance on the open market will lose their coverage and have to buy new policies. An insurance industry source told CNN Monday that the vast majority of Americans who have purchased coverage on the individual market will find their policies changed or even canceled under Obamacare rules. It's been known for some time that some of the policies would have to change -- the Department of Health and Human Services said in 2010 as part of a federal regulation that up to two thirds of individual policies wouldn't meet regulations allowing them to continue under what's called ""grandfathered"" status. That refers to plans allowed to continue even though they don't provide all the rights and protections of those offered under Obamacare. White House spokesman Jay Carney argued Monday the administration has always said some health care plans would not meet new Obamacare requirements. ""There are existing health care plans on the individual market that don't meet those minimum standards and therefore do not qualify for the Affordable Care Act,"" he said. ""There are some that can be grandfathered if people want to keep insurance that's substandard."" And those who lose coverage will be able to buy more comprehensive coverage on the health insurance exchanges -- some of them at a subsidized price, he said. But the reality that so many plans will disappear or have to change seems to fly in the face of what Obama said so often in selling the plan to voters. ""If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan,"" the president said in 2009, and frequently since. It also offered Republicans ammunition to renew their attacks on the plan. ""The larger problem is how Obamacare is hurting people out there,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday. ""It is about college graduates and middle-class families getting hit with massive premium increases they can't afford."" NSA spying . After months of seemingly endless leaks about U.S. surveillance programs, the pressure on the administration rose to new levels in recent days with revelations published by the German news magazine Der Spiegel that the United States was collecting the communications of allied leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Obamacare and NSA spying: What did Obama know, and when did he find out? German leaders respond angrily to the news, with Merkel demanding a stop to the practice and proclaiming that her country's confidence in the United States had been ""shaken."" But it was comments by the administration claiming that Obama did not know of the practice until recently that drew the sharpest criticism -- from both the right and the left. Rep. Peter King, the Republican chairman of the House Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence, was incredulous that the president didn't know what was going on. ""He certainly should have known, if he didn't,"" the former chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on ""The Situation Room."" ""I think that's almost more of a serious issue that something like that at that level would be conducted without him knowing it."" Rep. King on NSA spying: If Obama didn't know, he should have . And Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, said not knowing about the program was a ""big problem"" for both Obama and the Senate Intelligence Committee, which she chairs. ""As far as I'm concerned, Congress needs to know exactly what our intelligence community is doing,"" her statement said. ""To that end, the committee will initiate a major review into all intelligence collection programs."" Benghazi . Longstanding Republican criticism of the administration's handling of the attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, which left the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three other Americans dead, resurfaced this week with Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, threatening to hold up administration nominations over the issue. Senators are expected soon to review Obama's nominations for several high-profile judicial appointments and other nominations. Senate rules allow a single senator to at least temporarily hold up presidential nominations, and Graham says he will do so until the administration makes survivors of the attack available for congressional testimony. ""I'm going to block every appointment in the United States Senate until the survivors are being made available to Congress,"" he said. ""I'm tired of hearing from people on TV and reading about stuff in books. We need to get to the bottom of this."" The White House said Monday that Graham and other Republicans are using Benghazi for political purposes, ""and we find that unfortunate."" CNN's Ted Barrett, Catherine E. Shoichet, Jake Tapper, Jim Sciutto, Elise Labott, Brooke Baldwin and Jim Acosta contributed to this report.","The White House is on the defensive over claims some could lose health coverage .

"Beijing (CNN) -- A prominent Uyghur scholar labeled a separatist by Chinese authorities may have been tried in secret and received a heavy prison sentence, his lawyer told CNN on June 18. Ilham Tohti, an economics professor at Beijing's Minzu University, was detained by police in January and taken to Urumqi, capital of the restive far-western Xinjiang region, where a spate of recent violent incidents were blamed by the government on Uyghur separatists seeking to establish an independent state. State media has reported that Tohti was charged with separatism. Li Fangping, his lawyer, cited anonymous sources for the news of his client's secret trial and sentencing. ""I'm shocked but don't think these are groundless rumors,"" said Li, who has not been allowed to see Tohti for months. ""Considering the tense situation in Xinjiang, I think this is very possible."" Li said local police would neither confirm nor deny the news to him. CNN's repeated phone calls Wednesday to the Xinjiang government and police went unanswered. The foreign ministry declined to comment on the case Tuesday. Vocal critic . Tohti is known for his research on Uyghur-Han relations and has been a vocal critic of the government's ethnic policies in Xinjiang, a resource-rich region long inhabited by the Turkic-speaking, largely Muslim Uyghurs. The arrival of waves of Han, China's predominant ethnic group, over the past decades has fueled ethnic tensions. Human rights groups call Tohti's possible secret trial ""disturbing."" ""Secret trials of prominent activists are very rare these days in China -- one would expect at least a show trial with the presence of his lawyer,"" said Maya Wang, a Hong Kong-based researcher for Human Rights Watch. ""Tohti has long considered himself speaking out for Uyghurs' human rights in ways that are reasonable and acceptable to the authorities,"" she added. ""If harsh measures are being used against him, it really shows the authorities' line of tolerance has shifted a lot in the past year."" Widespread discrimination . Some Uyghurs have expressed resentment toward the Han majority in recent years over what they describe as harsh treatment from Chinese security forces and loss of economic opportunities to Han people in Xinjiang. Amnesty International has said that Uyghurs face widespread discrimination in employment, housing and educational opportunities, as well as curtailed religious freedom and political marginalization. Other critics, including exiled Uyghur activists, have attributed the rise of violence in Xinjiang to Beijing's increasingly repressive rule there -- a claim the government strongly denies. In the region's deadliest violent incident in recent history, a suicide bombing last month killed 39 people at a street market in Urumqi. Another apparent suicide bombing left three dead in April at an Urumqi train station. In March, 29 people were stabbed to death by alleged Uyghur separatists at a train station in the southwestern city of Kunming. The Chinese government has responded by launching a massive anti-terrorism campaign as well as pouring more economic resources into Xinjiang. Executions . On Monday, China executed 13 people convicted of terrorism charges related to attacks on public places in Xinjiang in recent months, state media reported. The same day, a court in Urumqi sentenced three people to death for their roles in a deadly attack in Beijing's Tiananmen Square last October. Defendant names revealed by state media all sounded Uyghur. ""Repression plus economic incentives -- that has continued to be the government response,"" said Wang, of Human Rights Watch. ""Economic development and job opportunities are important to the Uyghurs, but these things must be done in a way that respects their culture and freedom of expression. ""Unfortunately, the government is more interested in projecting what it wishes to do in Xinjiang rather than looking at what the real problems and ethnic grievances are in the region.""","Beijing-based scholar and critic of China's policies in Xinjiang may have had a secret trial, lawyer says .

"Toronto, Canada (CNN) -- Another day, another apology from Toronto Mayor Rob Ford, this time for crude comments about oral sex he made Thursday morning. But by afternoon, he had a television show. The day started with Ford -- who admitted last week that he had smoked crack cocaine in a ""drunken stupor"" about a year ago -- facing explosive new allegations of drunkenness, drug use and the verbal and physical abuse of aides. In the course of answering the allegations, he denied a female staffer's allegation that he sought to perform oral sex with graphic language of his own, stunning the reporters who surrounded him. Soon afterward, his wife at his side, Ford went back before reporters to say he had been under ""tremendous, tremendous stress"" and was getting unspecified support from ""a team of health care professionals."" But he called the latest allegations ""100% lies."" ""When you attack my integrity as a father and as a husband, I see red. Today I acted on complete impulse in my remarks,"" Ford said. He took no questions from reporters, who shouted sharp inquiries at him as he entered the office. ""Mayor Ford, why should we believe you? Why would you subject your family to this?"" one asked. ""What's the matter with you, Mr. Mayor?"" another said. The Toronto City Council voted 37-5 on Wednesday to ask Ford to take a leave of absence, and most members turned their backs on him when he addressed their Thursday meeting. Ford's brother Doug, a city council member, is urging him to take a leave of absence, a council source told CNN on condition of anonymity. The source did not want to be identified. The city council, meanwhile, has scheduled a special meeting on Monday to consider a motion to delegate duties not assigned by statute to the mayor. If approved, the motion would strip Ford of most of his duties. Among other things the motion calls for reallocating the operating budget of the office of the mayor to the city clerk, according the council's agenda published online. But in a new twist, Canada's Sun News Network announced that Ford and his brother Doug will begin hosting their own TV show on Monday. The show, ""Ford Nation,"" picks up where the two brothers left off on a talk radio show that ended its run last week, the network said on its website. A headline on that site posed the question, ""Canada's Ultimate Reality Show?"" And it quoted Doug Ford saying, ""Rob is like Howard Stern or Rush Limbaugh"" and ""You just never know what he is going to say."" ""Mayor Ford seems to be in a no-holds-barred mode,"" the network said. ""There is no filter. There is no careful treading."" Critics of Sun News Network have described its conservatism as ""Fox News North,"" according to a story about its launch in 2011 by the Toronto Globe and Mail. Ford also recently confessed to having purchased illegal drugs in the past two years, while he was in office. But he has steadfastly refused to step down, saying the voters of Canada's largest city should decide his fate in 2014. The latest allegations surfaced Wednesday in more than 500 pages of court documents that police used to get a search warrant for Alexander Lisi, Ford's friend and occasional driver, whom police accuse of marijuana possession and trafficking. Ford responded Thursday morning by threatening legal action against former staffers who claimed the mayor brought a woman appearing to be an escort to his office and drank alcohol while driving. The documents include police interviews with former staff members, information obtained from surveillance crews and cameras, and even an examination of the mayor's garbage. Several staffers said they were asked to buy alcohol for the mayor of Canada's largest city. One incident described by a former staffer alleged that Ford, while driving, stopped the vehicle, guzzled some vodka, and drove on. None of the allegations against Ford has been substantiated by investigators, and Ford faces no criminal charges. Ford called the allegations ""outright lies"" and told reporters, ""I'm sure none of you have never gotten behind the wheel after taking a drink."" On Thursday, Ford also said the so-called ""escort"" wasn't a prostitute but a family friend. He added that such allegations ""hurt my wife."" ""It makes me sick,"" he added. ""I've had enough."" According to the documents, Ford's former press secretary, George Christopoulos, said women often came to the mayor's office, ""and told staffers that they have smoked a joint with the mayor on the street outside of the bar. These women were told by the mayor that they could have a job."" Christopoulos would then have to interview these women and try to talk them out of a job. In a CNN interview Thursday evening, Toronto Police Chief Bill Blair declined comment on the investigation. ""It is a difficult situation for the city of Toronto and for our citizens, but we're working our way through it,"" Blair said. Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne said Thursday she was disturbed by recent events involving the Toronto mayor, and while it's not the province's role to impose its preferences on a city's government, the province would respond and provide new tools to the Toronto City Council if it indicated it needs help to carry out its duties, Wynne said. If so, she would consult other parties to see what could be done so partisan politics wouldn't be involved, she said. CNN's Paula Newton and Laura Dolan reported from Toronto, and Matt Smith reported and wrote from Atlanta.

"Bogota, Tennessee (CNN) -- Those who say no man is an island never met Danny Hayes. The 61-year-old retired construction supervisor lives in Bogota, Tennessee, a farming community so small that when asked how to find the town, locals respond, ""Don't blink."" Hayes' trailer in Bogota is about seven miles from the Mississippi River. Historic flooding across the region brought ""the Old Muddy"" much closer to him. The two-room trailer is more than 5 feet off the ground, but the river's invasion reaches Hayes' door and, at its height, threatened to evict him. ""There's the possibility the trailer could shift, could turn. Could flip over,"" Hayes said, standing on the trailer's small porch. ""Then again, I am not worried about that because I will get out."" The Mississippi's flooding has already forced hundreds to flee small towns like Bogota to cities like Memphis. And meteorologists say the heavy rainfall across the South could mean weeks more of high water. Whatever comes, Hayes said he will not be moved. ""I'd say for the average person who grew up in towns, you'd be in a dangerous situation,"" he said. ""I'd say a person who learned to live off the land and to survive, it's not a big thing."" The one acre of land Hayes retired to is no longer recognizable to him. Groves of pecan trees now stand half-covered in water. Homes abandoned by neighbors sit in several feet of dank and stinking water. To get to dry ground, Hayes paddles a small boat about 50 yards to Highway 78. Once on shore, he then walks the half-mile to town each day for a pack of cigarettes and a little conversation. The homes around Hayes' trailer sit empty, but as he waits out the flood, he is hardly alone. Since the waters began to rise, Hayes said, all manner of animals have swum by the trailer, looking for higher ground. The snakes, he shoots. ""It's illegal to kill snakes in Tennessee,"" he said with a serious look before breaking into a wide smile. ""Unless it's for your own protection."" The nine-shot revolver with a long barrel that Hayes keeps close also works to ward off other predators. Empty homes in the rural area could make for an inviting target for looters, he said. But his and his neighbors' homes are safe, Hayes said, while he patrols his small ""island."" To make his point, Hayes suddenly shoots the pistol three times in sudden succession into the invading waters. ""I am a crazy old man,"" he said with a laugh, ""And I will shoot the hell out of you, and I am serious about that."" As he waits for the waters to retreat, Hayes' family checks in with him regularly by cell phone. His two sons and their families fret about his decision to ride out the flood. But Hayes said he never considered leaving. He's too stubborn. So stubborn he married and divorced the same woman three times before they finally called it quits. Too stubborn ""to run for the hills over some water."" ""Rescue all them poor people and don't worry about this 61-year-old man,"" he said. ""Don't waste no 911 on me."" But with the water slowly receding, it appears that Hayes will be spared from the flood's wet grasp. Still, it could be another week, he predicted, before Bogota begins to dry out. Asked what he will do while the floodwaters retreat, Hayes replied with a ready joke. ""I got to sell this here land,"" he said, ""while it's still waterfront property!""

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A Chicago pediatrician who ""felt called"" to move to Afghanistan to treat children and train physicians was among three Americans killed Thursday at a Kabul hospital by an Afghan guard. The police guard opened fire on the pediatrician and four others with him at the CURE Hospital's gates, Kabul police said, in violence not unlike the ""green-on-blue"" attacks in which Afghan security forces fire upon coalition troops. Two others were killed, and a third person was injured in the hospital attack. A fourth person was unharmed. Dr. Jerry Umanos practiced medicine in inner-city Chicago before moving to Afghanistan in 2005, according to the U.S. hospital with which he was affiliated, Lawndale Christian Health Center. ""Our family and friends have suffered a great loss and our hearts are aching,"" his wife, Jan Schuitema, told reporters in Chicago. The doctor and his wife have three children together. ""I know Jerry would also really like everybody to know about his love for the Afghan people, and our love for the Afghan people, and that we don't hold any ill will towards Afghanistan in general, or even the gunman who did this. We don't know what his history is,"" she said. Schuitema stressed that her husband's work was an extension of his faith. ""He always had a desire to be the hands and feet of Christ. He was always a light for Christ,"" she said. Umanos was connected with Lawndale for more than 25 years, said Dr. Bruce Rowell, the hospital's chief clinical officer. ""He was a loving, caring physician"" who served his patients ""with the utmost of respect,"" he said. Umanos worked at the Kabul hospital as well as at a community health center, the only two training programs for Afghan doctors in the country, according to his biography at Lawndale's website, which noted that he ""felt called"" to go to Afghanistan nearly a decade ago. ""He loved the country, he loved the people, he loved to teach,"" a former colleague told CNN. ""As much as we love and miss him, all of us have a certain level of respect and contentment knowing Jerry died doing what he loved most."" The senior pediatrician had worked at the hospital in Kabul for seven years. Two of those killed Thursday were a father and son, said Suraya Dalil, Afghan minister of public health. The injured victim has undergone medical treatment and is in stable condition, she added. The police guard shot himself but survived, police spokesman Hashmatullah Stanekzai said. The motive for the attack was not immediately clear. U.S. National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden condemned the attack. ""Any such attack on civilians at a hospital is despicable and cowardly,"" she said in a statement. CURE is a nonprofit organization that operates hospitals and programs in 29 countries, according to its website. It said patients ""experience the life-changing message of God's love for them"" while receiving treatment regardless of gender, religion or ability to pay. The CURE hospital in Kabul has about 100 beds and about 37,000 patients annually. In Chicago and Afghanistan alike, Umanos knew that patients' circumstances meant that many could not return for follow-up visits, the Lawndale website said. ""In both places, he knows that he must provide the best care possible at each visit, because there is a chance that he may not see the patient again,"" his bio said. One colleague who spoke with Umanos just hours before his death said the pediatrician expressed excitement that a training program he developed was finally getting off the ground. ""Jerry and I worked closely for years to develop and implement training programs that provide local Afghan women with basic health education and skills to provide critical health services and best practices in their communities,"" said Evan A. Russell, a medical student at Johns Hopkins University and co-founder of Empowerment Health, a nonprofit group focusing on Afghan women and children. ""Just this morning, he expressed how excited he was that, after years of development with our Afghan partners, we were already on to our second day of training."" More attacks on foreigners . Afghanistan has seen a spate of deadly attacks against foreigners in recent weeks. On April 4, two Associated Press journalists were shot in Afghanistan's eastern Khost province. Award-winning German photographer Anja Niedringhaus was killed, and Canadian reporter Kathy Gannon was injured. And last month, five militants set off a deadly car bomb and then stormed a guesthouse used by foreigners in Kabul, the Afghan Interior Ministry said. The militants held several foreigners hostage, including three Americans, a Malaysian and a person from an unspecified African country. One girl was killed in the bombing. By the end of the hostage ordeal, one militant was shot and killed, and the other four blew themselves up. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the March attack. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said militants targeted a location that foreigners used as a church and for converting Afghans to Christianity.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The pervasive smoke spewing from the junk heap at Balad Air Force Base in Iraq is causing many returning troops to be concerned about the effects on their long-term health. The U.S. military burns waste -- including medical waste -- in pits near an Air Force base in Iraq. For four years, the burn pit was a festering dump, spewing acrid smoke over the base, including housing and the hospital. Until three incinerators were installed, the smelly pit was the only place to dispose of trash, including plastics, food and medical waste. ""At the peak, before they went to use the real industrial incinerators, it was about 500,000 pounds a day of stuff,"" according to a transcript of an April 2008 presentation by Dr. Bill Halperin, who heads the Occupational and Environmental Health Subcommittee at the Defense Health Board. ""The way it was burned was by putting jet fuel on it."" A lawsuit filed against the burn pit operators by a contractor alleges the burn pit also contained body parts.  Watch burn pits spew black smoke » . ""Wild dogs in the area raided the burn pit and carried off human remains. The wild dogs could be seen roaming the base with body parts in their mouths,"" says the lawsuit filed in Texas federal court. Aside from Balad, there are similar pits at bases elsewhere in Iraq and Afghanistan. Some still have no incinerators. 'Iraqi crud' Many of the soldiers who went through Balad since the beginning of the war had become used to ""Iraqi crud,"" as they dubbed the symptom. ""I had a chronic cough, irritation, shortness of breath,"" said Dr. Chris Coppola, an Air Force surgeon who worked on base in 2005 and again in 2007, ""I was coughing up phlegm, sometimes black stuff and dust."" While Coppola said he didn't work in the burn pit, he knew the medical waste was going there. ""In 2005, our hospital waste wasn't segregated,"" he said. ""Our trash went out the door and went into the burn pit."" By the time Coppola returned for his next tour, the hospital did separate its medical waste for disposal elsewhere, he said. Coppola said that when he worked at the base hospital, the emergency room had frequent visits for ""respiratory complaints, complaining of the coughing and breathing issues."" Since he's been back from Iraq, Coppola said he feels ""very healthy."" But other soldiers said they cannot shake the symptoms and they suspect the burn pit smoke is the cause. Dennis Gogel was stationed in Balad twice between 2004 and 2006. He said he was in housing just a few hundred yards from the pit and would often jog past the pit. The 29-year old Gogel said that in the last two years he's had upper respiratory infections, skin irritation and he's lost 60 pounds since deployment. ""I have blotchy spots on my face. I was treated for psoriasis, but it won't go way,"" he said. Gogel said his doctors do not know what caused the problems. ""You expect when you get to a new environment you would feel the effect, but it should get out of the system,"" he said. Gogel said it has affected his fitness, too. ""I used to run two miles in 10 minutes. I am up to 17,"" he said. Gogel has recently joined a class action lawsuit against the company contracted to handle waste disposal. Just months after returning home from his first tour in Iraq in 2006, Maj. Kevin Wilkins developed headaches, but did not see a doctor. Soon after his second Iraq tour in 2007, Wilkins -- a registered nurse in the Air Force reserve -- died of an advanced brain tumor. He was 51. His widow, Jill, suspects the burn pit at Balad. While the cause of his brain tumor is not known, Jill Wilkins was told by doctors who worked with her husband at a Florida emergency room that exposure to chemicals like those that come from burning trash is a potential risk. ""Kevin was in perfect health before he went to Iraq,"" Wilkins said. ""He's always been in good health, a healthy eater, exercises on a regular basis. There was not one thing wrong with him when he went to Iraq."" Wilkins is trying to show the cause was service related so she can get access to her husband's pension, medical insurance and other benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs. Concerning memos, questionable tests . One reason many soldiers suspect the burn pit is a widely circulated 2006 memo in which an environmental engineer cited a still-classified study labeling the pit ""the worst environmental site I have personally visited."" The memo, written by Lt. Col Darrin Curtis, a bioenvironmental engineering flight commander, concluded ""there is an acute health hazard for individuals."" ""There is also the possibility for chronic health hazards associated with the smoke,"" Curtis said. The memo is co-signed by Lt. Col James Elliott, chief, Aeromedical Services, who wrote that he concurred with Curtis' memo. ""In my professional opinion, the known carcinogens and respiratory sensitizers released into the atmosphere by the burn pit present both an acute and a chronic health hazard to our troops and the local populations,"" Elliott said. More alarm was raised in the military community when the initial draft of results from a 2007 study was released with a math error, overstating the dioxin levels tested by 1,000 times. The report was circulated by the military's U.S. Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine ""in the interest of transparency and the fact that they needed this information very quickly in order to answer service members' concerns,"" said Craig Postlewaite of the force readiness and health assurance office at the Department of Defense. But Postlewaite said the error has been corrected and the data re-analyzed. A new test and report will be out soon. The military said smoke from the pit exposed troops to toxic emissions, including low levels of cancer-causing dioxins. But its tests indicate there is no long-term danger, officials said. ""The data indicate that there are no substances above a health threshold that should generate any long-term health risks, including cancer,"" Postlewaite said. At the Pentagon's Force Health Protection Directorate, officials analyzed more than 160 air samples and concluded, in a soon to be released report, that the only risk is of temporary respiratory distress, nothing that poses a long-term threat. ""We have looked at respiratory health complaints for people that have been assigned to Balad. These complaints, by and large, are temporary in nature, most of them involve eye irritation, irritation of the upper respiratory passages, possibly a cough,"" Postlewaite  said. ""We know just right here in the United States for people that are around those kinds of conditions, like firemen, this is not unusual. But we feel that the data support the fact that these all should be temporary in nature."" A review of the findings by the military's advisory group of medical scientists and doctors concurred with the report's conclusions. However, in the general findings, the report questioned whether the conclusions would hold ""when more thorough analysis is conducted."" But a spokeswoman for the military said the final report, expected this week, will find the testing conducted was sufficient and conclusive. The reviewing panel also expressed concerns about how pervasive the burn pits were, according to a meeting transcript of the advisory group. ""It seems like there may be something systematic going on here in terms of waste disposal techniques going on in the [war] theater,"" notes Dr. Mark Brown, director of Environmental Agents Services at the Department of Veterans Affairs. ""You couldn't get away with this kind of waste disposal here in the United States. Pits still in use . The concern about the pits was first reported in the Military Times. Upon seeing that article, Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wisconsin, wrote to Gen. David Petraeus, the commander of U.S. forces in the Middle East, to express his concern about the smoke's effect on troops. Petraeus responded citing the military findings, but said burn pits are necessary. ""There is and will continue to be a need for burn pits during contingency operations,"" Petraeus wrote back to Feingold in a letter provided to CNN. Five years into the Iraq war, many bases still do not have incinerators. There are 17 solid waste incinerators, two hazardous waste incinerators and 24 medical waste incinerators operational in Iraq, according to the military. Another 23 are under construction with some not scheduled to be completed until the end of 2009. In Afghanistan, where the United States has been fighting since 2001, there are no incinerators. ""Our military leaders in Afghanistan are in the process of designing treatment/disposal facilities for solid waste,"" Petraeus wrote to Feingold. Feingold said he awaits the latest report. ""I remain concerned that service members may become sick as a result of exposure to fumes at Balad Air Base and potentially other bases in Iraq and Afghanistan,"" Feingold said. ""Service members who serve at the base for more than a year could still be in jeopardy as a result of exposure to the fumes.""

"Washington (CNN) -- In less than a month, the government may shut down. Lines are being drawn. Vacations are being canceled. Friends are becoming enemies. Are you concerned yet? Confused? Well, if you're not, you should be. At the center of complex negotiations in Washington is a sturdy little political device known as a continuing resolution, also called a ""CR."" A continuing resolution? A CR? What in the heck is that? Good question. It is a legislative tool designed to keep the government running when the president and Congress can't get it together. By October 1 -- the deadline to keep funding everything in the government from the IRS to the Army -- you'll probably hear the term hundreds of times in news articles and out of the mouths of commentators and pundits. So let's explain: . Q: What is a 'CR'? A: It's a legislative trick to pay the bills. The federal government's fiscal year starts October 1. And the one key duty laid out in the Constitution for Congress is to pass spending bills that fund the government. Want a few billion for roads and bridges? Go see Congress. That aircraft carrier needs a new paint job? Congress is the place to go. Sounds simple enough, but, in reality, the House and the Senate haven't done their job. In the past year, Congress hasn't passed any of the 12 different spending bills that fund the much of the government, including defense programs, transportation projects and education. So when Congress doesn't do its job, then it has to pass a continuing resolution, also referred to as a short-term spending bill or a stop-gap spending measure. It is a bill that sidesteps the lengthy budget process and funds the government for a specified period of time. It can last anywhere from a day to a year. CRs are not an anomaly. They have been used 156 times between 1977 and 2011. And before 1977, they were so common that Congress changed the start of the fiscal year from July to October to give lawmakers more time to pass the spending bills. That worked for a few years but then Congress settled into the new schedule and, like any high school student -- or journalist on deadline -- it procrastinated. So it had to revert back to the use of CRs to keep the government open. And here we are. Q: Why shut down the government? A: Yea, why? And what does CR have to do with a government shutdown? Often, a CR is a simple legislative extension to accommodate lawmakers who don't get their work done. It's not designed to solve a debate embroiled in partisan politics. ""Typically these appropriations bills are not that partisan,"" said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. But that's not always the case. Congress ""recognizes one of their leverages is the power of the purse,"" Ellis said, adding that politicization of the budget process has become more polarized during the Obama administration. House Speaker John Boehner has proposed a short-term spending bill that would fund the government until December 15. But then politics got in the way. This year, a core group of conservative Republicans in the House wants to tie the entire $986 billion annual operating budget to a provision to defund the health care law known as Obamacare. House GOP leaders delay vote on spending bill after conservatives rebel . Still, it's rare that the threat of a government shutdown revolves around a partisan legislative poison pill. More often it's about spending levels and the size of the government. That's the track Republicans usually take. Since 2011, they have used budget battles -- and taken the country to the edge of government shutdown -- to extract $2.3 trillion from federal spending. It's worth it, they say, to rein in the first two years of the Obama administration's spending spree, which included $830 billion in economic stimulus and an expensive new health care law. Q: Have we been here before? A. Yes. In 1995 and 1996, President Bill Clinton battled a Republican-led Congress over spending levels (his nemesis was then-Speaker Newt Gingrich). It ended in a government shutdown -- for 28 days at the end of 1995 and beginning of 1996 -- and the American public largely blamed Congress. Following the shutdown, Clinton gained an enormous political upper hand and Gingrich later lost his job as speaker. While politics seem particularly bad during these times, it's important to remember that the government hasn't actually shut down under this Congress or this president. Yet. Q: So why is this so hard? A. Passing spending bills is not easy. They can reflect the fundamental differences of governing philosophy. Should we fund school lunches or more tanks? Aid to Egypt or money for Detroit? It often takes intense negotiating between the two chambers of Congress and the president. But some in Congress complain that President Barack Obama has not been the easiest guy to work with, especially when it comes to bridging partisan gaps. He rarely interacts with members of Congress, many say they don't trust him and he has angered once-friends on the Hill with his recent positions on Syria. Congress shifts its focus away from Syria resolution . But the fight over the continuing resolution is just an extension of a deeper fight over the budget. Much to the dismay of Republicans, the Senate in recent years has failed to pass even a simple budget, a precursor to spending bills. And even though the Senate finally passed a budget -- it did so in March after the House acted -- leaders in both chambers couldn't agree to start the process of combining their versions into a final bill. So the budget went nowhere. Jim Manley, a former aide to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said the budget encapsulates Washington. ""The current budget process symbolizes all that is wrong with Congress right now. It's broken and needs to be fixed,"" he said. Q: But they're really not going to do this, are they? A: That's not clear. House Republican leaders are well aware of the political risks of threatening to shut down the government. They are reluctantly trying to avoid tying a short-term spending bill to defunding Obamacare. Not surprisingly, a CNN/ORC International poll shows that Republicans would again be blamed if the government does shut down. CNN Poll: Who would get blamed for government shutdown? ""Only a third would consider President Barack Obama responsible for a shutdown, with 51% pointing a finger at the GOP - up from 40% who felt that way earlier this year,"" said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. Q: Isn't this a really bad way to run the greatest democracy on Earth? A: Even if the continuing resolution wasn't wrapped up in talks of politics and government shutdown, Ellis argues that ""it's a terrible way to run government."" CRs fund the government at the same level as the previous year. That means wasteful programs that need to be stopped or cut back aren't, and programs that need more money don't get it. ""One way to force government to have waste and inefficiency is to have a CR,"" Ellis said. Q: Can it get any worse? A: It could. The CR is going to be one fight the Congress will have over the next couple of weeks. The next fight will be over the debt ceiling -- permitting the government to borrow more money to pay off its past spending debts. But that's a different story for a different day.

"(CNN) -- Some of the biggest names in tennis have faltered at Indian Wells, but Novak Djokovic showed his grit to beat Marin Cilic after being comprehensively outplayed in the first set. Djokovic will now have one eye on the crystal trophy as rivals Andy Murray and Stanislas Wawrinka crashed out against lowly opponents. The world No. 2 -- twice the winner at Indian Wells in 2008 and 2011 -- booked his place in the quarterfinals of the Masters 1000 tournament with a 1-6 6-2 6-3 victory in California on Wednesday. Cilic, seeded 24th, surged ahead to a 5-0 lead on his way to winning the first set, but Djokovic claims not to have been fazed. ""I was composed and mentally calm, regardless of the score line,"" he told reporters. ""I just accepted the fact that he came out of the blocks better than I did."" The match ended as a sweeping victory for the Serbian, who did not face a break point while taking the remaining sets. Djokovic finds himself the top-ranked player remaining at the first ATP Masters tournament of the year after the shock exit of world No. 1 Rafael Nadal in the third round and other high-seeded contenders in round four. Roger Federer is now the only other player from the top 10 remaining in the tournament. He reached the last eight with a 6-4 6-4 victory over German veteran Tommy Haas, but was robbed of the enticing prospect of an all-Swiss quarterfinal. The stage had been set for a clash between third-seeded Wawrinka -- still racing from January's Australian Open victory undefeated in 2014 before the match -- and former world No. 1. But 32-year-old Federer will now meet Kevin Anderson in the last eight after the South African defeated Wawrinka in three sets (7-6 (7/1) 4-6 6-1). At the end of a 13-match winning streak this year, the 28-year-old Swiss was reflective: ""I don't feel the pressure of losing a match, because I knew it's going to happen,"" Wawrinka told reporters. ""I'm not going to keep winning every tournament."" Wawrinka was not alone in faltering in the round of 16. Andy Murray was left to ponder his form after once again failing to reach the latter stages of the tournament. The world No.5 is yet to reach a final since having back surgery in September, and his limp performance against 23-year-old Raonic left him bemused. ""I'll need to have a think about it and have a look at what happened,"" Murray told reporters after the 4-6 7-5 6-3 defeat. ""It's going to come down to confidence. There's no other explanation for missing those shots."" Raonic, the 10th seed, will now face Nadal's conqueror Alexandr Dolgopolov. Order was restored in the women's tournament, where second-seeded Agnieszka Radwanska and sixth-seeded Simona Halep both recorded wins. Romanian Halep was first to book a place in the semis of the WTA singles, strolling to a 6-2 6-2 victory over unseeded Australian Casey Dellacqua. World No.3 Radwanska joined her later in the afternoon. She completed a three-set victory over Serbia's Jelena Jankovic (7-5 2-6 6-4) to set up a rematch of last month's semi-final in Doha. After that defeat, Radwanska will be hoping for a different result on Friday when the two will meet for a shot at the final.","Novak Djokovic booked his place in the quarter finals at Indian Wells .

"(CNN) -- Her almond-shaped brown eyes shine through her sunken face as a doctor lifts her sweater to reveal a tiny rib cage pushing against her skin. Little more than a year old, Israa al Masri wastes away at the National Hospital in the besieged Damascus suburbs just a few miles from the medical supplies needed to save her. Slowly, painfully, organs shut down one by one as her muscles atrophy until, barley breathing. On January 12, the toddler's heart stops. The cause of death: hunger. Starvation is the Syrian government's newest and cruelest weapon against opposition neighborhoods leaving infants with swollen heads and distended bodies, their mothers dry of breast milk, and their elders skeletal and dehydrated, according to activists and doctors. In one of the earliest cases, 1-year-old Farah Atout arrived at the Maliha medical center weak and whimpering as doctors struggled to find veins to feed her intravenously. ""I remember this child very well she was about a year old and she weighed only 4 kilograms,"" said Dr. Mazin Ramadan, who treated Atout last November. Her destitute family fled their village with just the clothes on their back, leaving them with little access to food, Ramadan said. ""They arrived and put this child between my hands and imagined with a shot or some medicine her strength would come back and the ordeal would be over,"" said Ramadan, one of the few pediatricians in the area. After just 48 hours, nothing remained of the baby but a skeletal frame with tubes bandaged to a yellowed face frozen in anguish. But what appeared at the time a unique horror, now repeats itself over and over in the Damascus suburbs, doctors and activists told CNN. Parents often risk death by sniper fire, simply to forage for nutrition. A nurse, who did not wish to be identified for fear of reprisal, in the besieged Yarmouk Palestinian Refugee Camp on the outskirts of Damascus told Amnesty International that around four people a day arrive with gunshot wounds from snipers targeting civilians as they pick plants and shrubs from nearby fields. Established in 1957, Yarmouk, an unofficial refugee camp, has been home for decades to thousands of Palestinians displaced by Arab-Israeli wars. At National Hospital South of Damascus, near Yarmouk, 43 people have died of starvation, 22 of them children, the youngest just 23 days old, with most of the deaths occurring this past month, a dramatic increase, according to hospital staff. ""Sometimes I get a case due to malnutrition or lack of medicine and, I feel utter desperation because I cannot help the child. We have reached a state where this is normal -- that every two to three days a child dies. It just feels like there is no nutrition. What can we do?"" said a doctor at the hospital who did not wish to be identified out of fear of Syrian forces. Parents sometimes crumble in the face of despair and very few options. ""I had a 2-year-old patient just a few days ago, and she was diagnosed with a life threatening condition and when her father found out he said 'OK. I will take her home to die.' Just like that -- without hesitation. He said 'What am I to do? There is no food and no medicine,' "" the doctor said. Infants are particularly vulnerable. ""The first 1000 days of life, from conception to 2 years are absolutely critical as far as nutrition and the developmental foundations of life are concerned. If the child in the womb of a pregnant mother, and the mother isn't getting the food she needs and there is this obstacle in the way of getting access to this kind of vital nutrients they need to grow. They are not going to recover. That is a real tragedy,"" said Greg Barrow a spokesman for the United Nations World Food Programme. In a video widely viewed on YouTube of a skeletal 10-year-old named Bashar Kaboush in the eastern Ghouta town of Jisreen, a distraught man who CNN has confirmed is a relative of the child shouts: ""Is this acceptable to God? Look at this child. Is this acceptable to world? Does the look like a human body? Is this the arm of a child? He is just 10 years old."" Mohammed Abu al Rgaa an activist in Jisreen told CNN that residents fear Kaboush and dozens of others may soon die of hunger. Rgaa shared with CNN the case of 8-month-old Mohamad Faissal from the same town who recently died from lack of infant milk and proper medical care. Shocking online video of Faissal's lifeless body bore the hallmarks of starvation such as a swollen abdomen and protruding ribs, doctors said. The cause of crisis is clear. The once thriving agriculture belt to the east of the capital and the collection of towns and neighborhoods to the south wilted under a government siege blocking food staples from those areas. Opposition-controlled farmland lies desolate after nearly two years of warfare that has destroyed crops and livestock, leaving little more than stores of grain for thousands trapped behind government tanks. Many say the blockades are used by the Syrian government as collective punishment against opposition areas. Hostilities make it difficult to gain a clear view of the scope and scale of malnutrition in the area, but the WFP estimates at least 800,000 civilians remain under siege. ""This underlines exactly why humanitarian agencies like the WFP have been calling for more access. To really see with their eyes: What is the scale of the problem? Who is most vulnerable? What kind of assistance do they need? And how can we get it in fast? That is absolutely critical,"" Barrow said. Amnesty International has been more direct: ""The Syrian government is cruelly punishing civilians living in opposition-held areas. Starving civilians as a method of warfare is a war crime. The blockades must be lifted immediately and access to humanitarian aid must never be used to score military or political gains,"" said Philip Luther, Amnesty International's Middle East and North Africa director. Syrian officials failed to respond to CNN requests for comment on this story, but have said in general terms that ""foreign-backed terrorists"" catapulted the country into a spiral of violence that has triggered Syrian army efforts to expel opposition fighters from the Damascus suburbs. Perhaps most disturbingly, packed aid convoys ready and willing to deliver assistance to those in need are barred from doing so -- mainly by Syrian government troops. ""The road to political stability and confidence building in Syria starts with an important step: ensuring no one dies because of a lack of food or medicine or from the cold when humanitarian workers are nearby but are not allowed in"" said Ertharin Cousin, WFP's executive director. Geneva II peace talks secured an agreement for some aid to enter the Yarmouk Palestinian Refugee Camp this week, but several hundred food parcels and limited medical evacuations are simply not enough to stave off malnutrition. ""To make any progress in addressing these needs, UNRWA's presence and humanitarian assistance work must be permitted to continue and expand over a period of months, not days,"" Chris Gunness, Spokesman for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees said in a statement. ""If the siege does not end, I expect even I will be dead,"" Assaf said over a crackly Skype connection. ""If the siege is not broken these cases will increase and there will be mass death. To be honest this is what I would expect: mass death.""","Many are starving in suburbs south of Damascus, Syria .

"Orlando, Florida (CNN) -- Virtual life is around us every day, from online communities to simulation in computer games. It's fun, but it's also useful. The United States military uses simulation technology to train pilots, soldiers who take part in convoys and medics, who are similar to civilian emergency medical technicians. New battery-operated, remote-controlled mannequins can simulate bleeding and breathing, and they have blinking eyes that dilate. Medics can test their skills on these life-like mannequins. The new units, which are packed with technology, are used at 23 U.S. Army Medical Simulation Training Centers as part of a program to teach lifesaving techniques to medics and nonmedical personnel. A Pentagon study says the training program has saved 1,000 soldiers' lives in combat, said Lt. Col. Wilson Ariza, manager of the U.S. Army Medical Simulation Project. The centers -- originally designed to train medics and first responders before deployment to Iraq, Kuwait and Afghanistan -- became so good at saving lives on the battlefield that training was added to include everyday soldiers. The latest mannequins are anatomically correct and have life-like skin, allowing soldiers to practice lifesaving techniques to stop bleeding and start intravenous medications. A computer captures the medics' actions to ensure that they take the right steps. ""That simulator will breathe and bleed. And if it's bleeding, you have to apply the proper pressure to stop or control the bleeding, or the simulator will die, Ariza said. The training takes place over five days at military bases in the United States and overseas. The last day is the toughest. In an exercise, a simulated bomb explodes inside a tent, and a soldier screams ""Help me! Help me!"" as a medic rushes to a man whose legs appear to be blown off. Blood squirts from the mannequin's severed limbs, which have exposed muscles and bone. The graphic scene includes soldiers lying on the ground with facial injuries. A tourniquet is applied to the mannequin's legs, stopping the bleeding. The screaming soldier is an actor, lying on a cot, who has only the top half of his body exposed. The bottom half is the mannequin. ""When you first walk in, it's scary. It's like, 'Wow, this is real, this is training?' "" said Staff Sgt. Kelly Whitesell, a medic with the 7235th Medical Support Unit in Orlando. ""Then you get into the treatments, and that is like treating a real patient."" In 2007, Whitesell was one of the first to take the course in Kuwait before deploying to Iraq. He's now a medical trainer. Advances in technology have been crucial to the training. A decrease in computer size, along with an increase in power, made devices such as the mannequins possible, giving them the ability to simulate bleeding and breathing. As computing power increases, so does realism and the clarity of simulators. One simulator used by the Army teaches soldiers how to survive or avoid an ambush while traveling in a convoy. Col. Francisco Espaillat, manager of the U.S. Army Tactical Trainer Program, says military convoys are targets in Iraq and Afghanistan. Espaillat recalls the story of Pfc. Jessica Lynch, whose convoy in Iraq was attacked in 2003. Lynch was captured by Iraqis and rescued a week later by U.S. forces. Espaillat uses Lynch story to show the importance of simulators. The convoy tactical trainer is equipped with a Hummer, a communication system and guns just like the ones used on the battlefield. ""We suspend reality and immerse our soldiers in a synthetic environment that stresses them so their training comes in to play,"" Espaillat said. ""So when they are faced with it in the real world, they know how to respond because they have been there."" This tactical trainer is mobile, so it can ""bring the training to the soldier versus taking the soldier to the trainer,"" Espaillat said. A mobile trainer is flexible, and it also cuts down on expenses -- a requirement for today's military, whose pockets are not as deep as they once were. Most other simulators cost millions of dollars, require enormous computing power and are not very mobile. Lockheed Martin's newest simulator can transform from a fixed-wing aircraft to a tank by just rebooting the computer software. The Multiple Function Training Aid's cockpit is made up of consumer touch-screen monitors that run off one gaming-quality computer with added graphics cards. The compact device can easily be shipped where the military needs to keep soldiers up to date. One device could fulfill the training needs of one base -- from truck drivers to aircraft pilots -- at a fraction of the cost of large simulators. ""Any time you can save money,"" said Air Force Lt. Col. Scott Moore, director of operations for the 29th Training Systems Squadron at Eglin Air Force Base, who recently tried the device. ""It's the taxpayer's money you are saving."" Large-scale simulators costing tens of millions of dollars still have their place, despite their price tag, said John Lenyo, president of CAE USA, which operates simulation training centers for military pilots. ""We will still need our war fighters trained as our budgets get tighter and tighter,"" he said. That's because training in actual airplanes costs tens of thousands of dollars an hour in fuel, not to mention the added danger, he said. ""You will see a shift from live training where soldiers and airmen go out to fly or go to the range to shoot -- some of that will be moved more and more to simulation,"" he said. The modeling and simulation industry has responded to the military's needs through increased simulation innovation in 3D, interactivity and emerging technologies, such as avatars, at a lower cost. Moore, who normally flies a B-52, tried out the simulation for a CV-22 tiltrotor aircraft, which is kind of a cross between a helicopter and a turboprop airplane. ""I didn't crash, too often,"" he said with a laugh. ""And that's the best part of a simulator, you know. You get to practice that sort of thing. If you make a mistake, you can hit the reset button ... ""There's no reset button in a real airplane.""","The U.S. military uses simulation technology to train pilots, soldiers and medics .

"(CNN) -- Grigor Dimitrov backed up his undoubted talent with a gutsy display to beat South Africa's Kevin Anderson in a three-hour final at the ATP Tour event in Mexico. The 22-year-old Bulgarian prevailed 7-6 3-6 7-6 in a match which finished at 1.13 am local time Sunday as Dimitrov took full advantage of his first match point. His girlfriend Maria Sharapova tweeted ""Inspired!"" after Dimitrov wrapped up his hard-fought victory in a match which contained just one break of service on the fast blue hard courts in Acapulco. Dimitrov, who is now coached by Roger Rasheed, will rise to a projected 16th in the new world rankings with his reputation enhanced by a semifinal victory over Britain's Andy Murray. That marathon three-setter ended in the early hours of Saturday morning and it left Dimitrov with concerns about his physical condition heading into the title match with the big-serving Anderson. ""Belief is the only thing that kept me going today,"" Dimitrov told the official ATP Tour website. ""I didn't think I was going to come back after last night's match. I'm really happy. This title means a lot to me. ""Every match I played was really tough, especially the last three where I played three sets."" He took the opener by emphatically winning the opening tiebreaker 7-1, but Anderson hit back with a break of service in the second to force a decider. That proved equally close until Anderson hit a backhand long at 5-5 and Dimitrov closed out the match on the next point. It was the second ATP title for Dimitrov, who has had to live up to the tag ""Baby Federer"" because of perceived similarities in his style of play with the 17-time grand slam champion. Dimitrov is reported to have joined the management group which Federer and his agent Roger Godsick are setting up to represent a small group of elite players. 'Team Federer"" has certainly enjoyed a successful weekend with the Swiss maestro claiming his sixth Dubai title earlier Saturday with victory over Tomas Berdych. Both of the weekend winners will head to the Masters 1000 event in Indian Wells, California where Dimitrov is set to be a dangerous outsider based on his performances in Mexico. In the WTA tournament in Acapulco, Australian Open finalist Dominika Cibulkova beat Christina McHale 7-6 4-6 6-4. It was the fourth career crown for the Slovakian top seed, who lost to China's Li Na in the final of the opening grand slam of the season.","Grigor Dimitrov wins ATP tournament in Mexico .

"Paris, France (CNN) -- No matter whatever else happens in tennis' clay-court season, Rafael Nadal is almost an automatic at the French Open. Nadal won an unprecedented ninth title at Roland Garros and now only trails Roger Federer on the men's grand slam ladder after seeing off Novak Djokovic 3-6 7-5 6-2 6-4 on a third consecutive day of steamy weather in Paris, which did no favors for the Serb -- who appeared to vomit slightly in the last set. Their tussle couldn't compare to last year's five-set classic in the semifinals or their six-hour duel at the Australian Open in 2012 but the final outcome, to Nadal's delight, is that he tied Pete Sampras on 14 majors, three behind the 32-year-old Federer. ""You are a great champion, Rafa,"" Sampras said in an email sent to CNN. ""Congratulations on number 14."" Nadal was supposed to be vulnerable here. He merely won one European clay-court title this year before Paris, his lowest haul since 2004 -- and that year the Spaniard skipped the campaign's second major. There were upset defeats in Monte Carlo and Barcelona, and Nadal's coach, Toni Nadal, admitted he only won in Madrid because his opponent, Kei Nishikori, was hurt. With every passing encounter against Djokovic at the French Open, the Serb had won more games and kept Nadal on court for longer. He was getting closer. His victory over Nadal in the Rome final in May, his fourth straight overall against the left-hander, gave his backers greater hope. ""My best wasn't (like it was) against him in Rome,"" Djokovic told reporters. Nadal, however, stormed into this year's finale in record time -- for him -- playing a near flawless three final sets against 2013 finalist David Ferrer, crushing Andy Murray in the semis and lifting his game when it mattered against Djokovic, minus a rare hiccup late in the fourth set. ""Mentally I was so strong,"" said Nadal, 28. ""I really wanted to defeat him. When there were problems cropping up, I managed to find the solutions."" Yes, if Djokovic needed any reminding, Nadal at the French Open -- in a best-of-five format -- is a different character to the one that competes in prep tournaments in a shorter format. He's 66-1 at the French, with those nine titles alongside. Despite that, the notoriously tough Toni Nadal said his nephew was ""not special."" ""If Rafa has done it, I'm sure another can do it,"" he told reporters. ""Rafael is not special ... another can do the same. But it's not easy. To win nine in 10 years is for me, unbelievable."" Djokovic, in tears during the trophy presentation, will have to wait to complete his grand slam collection. He missed out, too, on reclaiming the No. 1 ranking from Nadal. While Nadal's knees have constantly troubled the Mallorcan throughout his career, the heat has never been Djokovic's friend. He suffered against Ernests Gulbis on Friday, the first time high temperatures were a factor this fortnight, but had enough to see off the rejuvenated Latvian in four sets. On Sunday -- unlike two days ago -- he donned a cap from the outset in an attempt to lessen the effects of the sun. Djokovic said in his post-match news conference it was ""normal that you have ups and downs"" physically against Nadal at the French Open but his influential co-coach, Marian Vajda, blamed his two-match dip on a ""stomach problem."" He lamented his charge's normally splendid return game. ""I was not happy with his return today,"" Vajda told reporters. But he added, ""Rafa changed his serve very good, mixed it up and caught him a bit off balance. He served very smart, where to serve and Novak was a bit unsure."" As popular as Djokovic is for his dance moves, humor -- and chatting to ball kids during rain delays -- it was Nadal who received the louder applause as they walked on court. Djokovic is always playing catch up when it comes to matching Federer, Nadal, and even Murray, in support, at least at the start of proceedings. Both players were untroubled on serve until the eighth game, when Nadal's forehand -- uncharacteristically -- went off. He missed three inside-out forehands to gift Djokovic a 5-3 lead. For the first time in six tries at Roland Garros, Djokovic claimed the opening set against Nadal. A more aggressive Nadal broke for 4-2 in the second, yet he didn't cruise thereafter. A double fault contributed to an immediate break back and the set went on serve until 6-5. Serving to stay in the second set for a second time, Djokovic crumbled. Nadal let out a large roar after pummeling a forehand winner for 7-5. The tennis was hardly scintillating but by the end of the second, Nadal's forehand returned. The points and games were becoming extended, exactly the type of battle that favored Nadal. The outlook shifted. ""Without that second set, I don't know if I have this trophy with me now,"" said Nadal. A fired-up Nadal, the crowd still on the defending champion's side and the issues with his body all seemed to weigh down Djokovic. He dumped a simple looking backhand volley into the net on a serve-and-volley to trail 2-0. Djokovic's frustration boiled over when he slammed his racket to the court after erring on a cross-court backhand at 2-4. That seventh game would be pivotal. Nadal couldn't convert a handful of game points but slammed the door shut when Djokovic suddenly found himself with a break point. He sealed the 10-minute game with the aid of trademark defense -- and an unforced backhand error from the Serb. It was a matter of ""when"" not ""if"" Nadal would break in the fourth and it came in the sixth game. But what happened next wasn't in the script: A shaky Nadal forehand, double fault and errant smash handed Djokovic a lifeline, 4-3. Such a nervy game from Nadal in a grand slam final is almost never witnessed. Wanting more tennis, the fans, for the first time, began chanting, ""Novak, Novak."" A re-energized Djokovic obliged to make it 4-4. Djokovic's time to pounce was now, but he let Nadal off the hook. Allowing Nadal to convert a forehand winner down the line, Djokovic pounded his head with his racket. Djokovic blew a 30-0 lead in the final game, undone by a double fault on match point after a fan called out during his earlier service motion, forcing him to start over. ""I was happy with (Novak's) performance"" in the tournament, said Vajda. ""Maybe he had these problems a bit, he was fighting himself. It's always tough to lose in the final but I think he's a fighter. He will move to the (next) grand slam."" Nadal sunk to his knees, and like women's champion Maria Sharapova on Saturday after her victory over Simona Halep made the trek to the players' box. The outcome was even sweeter for Nadal after a back injury rendered him less than 100% in January's Australian Open final against Stan Wawrinka. Before turning his thoughts to Wimbledon, where Nadal has been upset the previous two years, you can be sure he'll be doing some celebrating Sunday night. And it's in southwest Paris, again.","Rafael Nadal wins French Open for record ninth time .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- British new wave ska legends The Specials rounded off the Brixton leg of their 30th anniversary tour with an electric performance that threatened to bring the crumbling south London venue crashing to the ground. The frenzied crowd at London's Brixton Academy . The six-piece 2-tone outfit originally from the English Midlands played a total of five dates at what is now the O2 Academy, such was the phenomenal demand for tickets. It's no surprise really. From the rarefied perspective of the VIP bar, the sea of bobbing heads and mobile phone displays (which seem to have replaced cigarette lighters) created a fantastic spectacle. But down among the rude boys and rude girls the carnival atmosphere seemed to ratchet up a notch with each song. Balding, sweaty 40-something men in Fred Perry polo shirts were transported back to the late 1970s as they bounced around unselfconsciously, while post-Margaret Thatcher indie kids sloshed their pints in the air and enjoyed this unique experience for the first time. No one was standing with their arms folded here. Despite songwriter Jerry Dammers' continued absence and Lynval Golding's lost voice, the band was as tight as it ever was, both musically and personally. As soon as the curtain rose the band wasted little time plugging into the hysteria that greeted them. If ""Do The Dog"" appeared to hit the spot, then tracks such as ""Too Much Too Young,"" and ""Gangsters"" literally had the earth moving in this imposing old theatre. Terry Hall, showing no sign of fatigue after a recent throat infection and the band's homecoming gig in Coventry the previous night, was in a chirpy mood. The Manchester United fan enjoyed reminding the London audience about his team's league success that afternoon. Meanwhile, the irrepressible Neville Staple seemed to galvanize the rest of the band with his seemingly limitless energy -- he must have spent the entire gig running on the spot. The dapper singer has aged well and was clearly reveling in the band's return to the spotlight. Despite only reforming recently, The Specials have rediscovered their mojo. They possess the kind of stage presence reserved for the truly great acts, while their lyrics still resonate today. ""Ghost Town"" encapsulated the gritty reality of Britain's urban landscape in 1981, and few in the audience would have argued that it remains a relevant portrait in today's troubled economic times.","The Specials reformed for a 30th anniversary tour .

"Orlando, Florida (CNN) -- Billing Casey Anthony more than $516,000 for expenses incurred in trying -- and failing -- to prove the Orlando woman guilty of murder in the death of her daughter is little more than sour grapes, one of her attorneys argued in a hearing Friday. Prosecutors say they have a right to demand repayment from Anthony because she was convicted on four counts of lying to investigators in the disappearance of her daughter Caylee in 2008. But defense attorney J. Cheney Mason said the bill is unfair after his client's acquittal on the most serious charge of murder. ""What about the justice for the defense that won?"" Mason asked Orange County Judge Belvin Perry Jr. ""We're now going to get whacked again ... pay for everything they did, their trips, their meals, their books, and their experts, none of which, none of which, had anything to do with the crimes of conviction,"" Mason said. Prosecutor Linda Drane Burdick told Perry he should approve their request. ""The argument of the defense completely misses the point of my position as it relates to the costs of prosecution specifically,"" she said. ""And that is that, but for Ms. Anthony's lying to law enforcement at the inception of this investigation, there would be no costs of investigation."" Perry did not rule on the request following Friday's lengthy hearing, which Anthony did not attend. He will research legal briefs due next week and research the law before issuing a ruling. The Florida Department of Corrections said in a statement Friday that Anthony checked in with her probation officer -- on Thursday -- as ordered under the terms of her sentence following her 2010 conviction on check fraud charges. Anthony told her probation officer that she is unemployed, has not earned any income over the past 30 days and has not enrolled in any educational or vocational classes. ""No violations have been noted"" of Anthony's probation, which include prohibitions against illicit drug use and excessive drinking, the department said. The meeting took place out of the public eye, as Anthony has remained in seclusion since her release from prison in July following her acquittal on murder charges in the 2008 death of her 2-year-old daughter. In fact, corrections officials have not disclosed her whereabouts, citing concerns for her safety. Caylee Anthony's skeletal remains were found in December 2008 in woods less than a mile from the home she shared with her mother and grandparents. Anthony's attorneys admitted she lied to authorities during the search for her daughter, saying she knew that she was dead. Her attorneys have alleged that the girl died accidentally. In seeking reimbursement, prosecutors have cited a Florida law that allows the state to fine defendants in criminal cases to recoup money spent. Prosecutors say the Orange County Sheriff's Office spent $293,123.77 on the case and the district attorney's office spent at least $140,390.60. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement spent $71,939.56 and the Metropolitan Bureau of Investigation spent $10,645.38, according to court documents. But Mason said prosecutors are asking for reimbursement for items that have nothing to do with the crimes of which she was convicted. He said, should Perry find that there is some merit to the state's motion, that he should limit expenses to only those costs related to police efforts to locate Caylee Anthony. InSession's Grace Wong contributed to this report.","NEW: Anthony tells her probation officer she's jobless, hasn't had alcohol, the state says .

"Brad, Texas (CNN) -- Authorities were working on plans Friday for residents who were forced to flee a wildfire in northern Texas to return home, a day after firefighters made progress battling the blaze that destroyed dozens of homes. The blaze in Palo Pinto County scorched 6,200 acres by Thursday, according to the Texas Forest Service. The fire is burning near the resort of Possum Kingdom Lake, near the town of Brad, about 100 miles west of Dallas. ""We feel much better about this fire today,"" as the blaze is now 50% contained, said John Nichols, a spokesman for the Forest Service. He said evacuations were lifted for some residents forced to evacuate the fire, which was driven by high temperatures and dry winds. The wildfire has destroyed 40 homes and nine RVs since it began Tuesday, the Forest Service said Thursday. Firefighters were receiving support from aerial tankers and helicopters. Authorities are mapping out plans to allow residents to return to their homes, said Palo Pinto County Sheriff Ira Mercer. Authorities also are trying to open the lake for the Labor Day holiday, he said. On Wednesday, evacuations were ordered in several communities on the north side of the lake after the fire charged over a ridge and approached a dam on the lake, CNN affiliate WFAA reported. The wildfire was moving so fast that the Forest Service pulled out of its command observation post, telling journalists and onlookers to get out of the way of the fire. ""My house is right through here, though it may be gone,"" Tom Hardeston told WFAA as he watched the fire. Nearby ranchers battled to save their herds from the encroaching fire. ""I'm just moving them from pasture to pasture,"" Cindi McCoy told WFAA, referring to her livestock. ""As one pasture burns, I'm moving them back to that one and bring(ing) them back around."" The weather forecast continued to predict mostly dry weather for the area for Friday, with high temperatures from the mid-90s into the 100s, the Forest Service said. Texas is experiencing the worst fire season in state history. Since fire season began last November, a record 3.5 million acres have burned. Hot and dry weather combined with a historic drought have made conditions ripe for rapid fire growth. In the past seven days, the Forest Service has responded to 224 fires burning a combined 31,541 acres. Meanwhile, in neighboring Oklahoma, firefighters were battling hot spots Thursday from a wildfire in northeast Oklahoma City, Fire Chief Keith Bryant said. National Guard helicopters were assisting, Bryant said. The blaze was one of two large brush fires that had covered more than 16 square miles on the city's north and south sides Wednesday, forcing some evacuations and closure of Interstate 40 and the Turner Turnpike. Both roads were later reopened, CNN affiliate KOCO said. CNN's Dave Alsup contributed to this report.","A wildfire in northern Texas is 50% contained, the authorities say .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's momentum has stopped and rebels have been able to hold onto areas that government forces had been poised to capture just a few days ago, a U.S. official said Monday. Gadhafi has declared a cease-fire, the official said, and the coalition is watching carefully to see if that declaration ""is a pledge or just words."" An opposition spokesman said Monday there is no cease-fire, at least not in Misrata, a key city about two hours east of Tripoli. The spokesman, Mohamed -- who would not divulge his last name out of concern for his safety -- said the destruction there is ""unimaginable"" and that Misrata was bombarded heavily over the past four days by forces loyal to Gadhafi. ""He keeps talking about a cease-fire, but he hasn't observed that for one minute here,"" Mohamed said. Based on what he saw at a hospital, Mohamed said Monday's death toll among civilians at the hands of pro-Gadhafi forces was 15. Another 51 civilians died in weekend attacks by pro-Gadhafi forces, Mohamed said. Late Monday, state television reported that Misrata was firmly in the hands of government forces, and it urged residents to celebrate. The head of U.S. forces in Libya told reporters that coalition forces had made ""very effective"" progress Monday toward their goal of enforcing a U.N. Security Council resolution intended to protect civilians from attack by forces loyal to Gadhafi. ""I assess that our actions to date are generally achieving the intended objectives,"" said Gen. Carter Ham, commander of U.S. Africa Command. ""We think we have been very effective in degrading his ability to control his regime forces."" No Libyan aircraft has been observed operating since the military operations began over the weekend, he said. In addition, air attacks have stopped Libyan ground forces from approaching the eastern rebel stronghold of Benghazi, and some are even turning back from the city, he said. During the prior 24 hours, he said, U.S. and British forces launched 12 Tomahawk land attack missiles aimed at command-and-control facilities, a Scud surface-to-surface military facility and, in a repeat attack, an air defense site. Approximately 80 sorties were flown Monday, more than half of them by air forces representing countries other than the United States, he said. Air forces from France, Spain, Italy, Denmark and Britain flew missions to maintain a no-fly zone over Benghazi, Ham said. Actions on Monday were focused on extending the no-fly zone to al-Brega, Misrata and then to Tripoli, a distance of about 1,000 kilometers (more than 600 miles). Canadian and Belgian forces joined coalition forces Monday, he said, and aircraft carriers from Italy and France have added ""significant capability"" in the region. The coalition is also deciding who should be in charge of its military operations, Ham said. NATO could command the mission, but some Arab nations are hesitant to fly under a NATO banner and that has held up the move, said one official who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of negotiations. If Arab nations don't sign on to a NATO mission, the other option would be to create an ad hoc command-and-control structure piece by piece, the defense official said -- but that would take time. Gadhafi's compound in Tripoli lay in shambles Monday after an attack by the United States and its allies. Ham said the compound contains a command-and-control facility, which he said coalition forces attacked. Gadhafi himself has not been targeted and there are no plans to do so, Ham added. In fact, he said, ""I could see accomplishing the military mission, which has been assigned to me, and the current leader would remain the current leader."" Ham continued, ""I don't think anyone would say that that is ideal. But I could envision that as a possible situation, at least for the current mission that I have."" U.S. President Barack Obama repeated Monday that Gadhafi ""needs to go,"" but he acknowledged the strongman may remain in power for some time because the allied military mission in North Africa has a narrow mandate of protecting innocent civilians. Obama said he's hopeful that other ""tools"" the administration has used, such as freezing billions in Libyan assets, will eventually help the Libyan people push Gadhafi out. A press and information coordinator for rebels in Benghazi said rebel leaders do not want coalition forces to target Gadhafi. That, said Mohammed Fannoush, is the job of the opposition. He added the opposition has compiled a list of names of Gadhafi loyalists and imprisoned 150 of them in Benghazi for them eventually to stand trial. Some of them, he said, had carried out attacks against their fellow Benghazi residents or were planning to. Libya's request for an emergency Security Council meeting about the matter was not approved Monday. The Security Council resolution, which passed Thursday, allows member states ""to take all necessary measures to protect civilians under threat of attack in the country ... while excluding a foreign occupation force of any form on any part of Libyan territory."" Support for the attacks was not universal. The Russian government said the mission has killed innocent civilians and urged more caution, and India, China, and Venezuela have also spoken out against the airstrikes. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon -- who met Saturday with Moussa and other world leaders to discuss Libya -- said support from Arab leaders was key to the Security Council's decision. Arab League Secretary-General Amre Moussa told CNN Monday that the league's vote on March 12 to support a no-fly zone does not mean that all Arab countries will participate. Yussuf bin Alawi bin Abdullah, Oman's foreign minister, has said Arab League members agreed to support the no-fly zone despite reservations about military intervention. The Libyan government has said that 48 people, mostly women, children and clerics, have died in allied attacks. U.S. Vice Admiral Bill Gortney, however, said there is no indication of any civilian casualties. France -- which conducted the first strike in Libya on Saturday when fighter jets fired at a military vehicle -- also disputed claims of civilian deaths. CNN's Ivan Watson, Virginia Nicolaidis, Pam Benson, Arwa Damon, Yousif Basil, Charley Keyes, Chris Lawrence, Jill Dougherty, Elise Labott, Paula Newton, Richard Roth, Maxim Tkachenko, Niki Cook and journalist Mohamed Fadel Fahmy contributed to this report .","There is no cease-fire in Misrata, a rebel spokesman says .

"(CNN) -- Recently, a young Nigerian girl—just 15 years old—approached a group of police officers and blew herself up. The attack failed; she claimed no lives but her own. Boko Haram may have launched bloodier attacks, but I struggle to imagine a more heinous terror plot. That girl was just one of four Nigerian women to weaponize themselves this July in the populous northern city of Kano. The second attempt, targeting a shopping mall, likewise killed just the bomber. The third slaughtered three women lined up to buy oil for their cook-stoves. The fourth cut short the lives of six young people at Kano Polytechnic. These attacks cast in sharp relief a trend that needs greater attention: the real and growing participation of women in extremist movements. We take for granted that young girls don't strap on suicide vests, and yet they sometimes do. Women and girls have scant rights under the medieval control of the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham, or ISIS. Our instincts say they would never join in its abusive rule over other women, and yet they have. We're used to thinking that men have a monopoly on violent extremism -- except they don't. We need a better understanding of what drives women to take part in, and even give their lives for, violent movements that insist on their inferiority. We can't counter radical narratives if we don't understand the motives of the radicalized. The Atlantic's Kathy Gilsinan recently highlighted the surprising efforts of the al-Khansaa Brigade of ISIS. Wandering the streets of Raqqa, they wave firearms and enforce the jihadist code of conduct -- and they do it all while fully veiled, because the brigade is entirely female. That grim vision of women's participation challenges our less-than-nuanced understanding of radical movements. Why do women contribute to groups like Boko Haram and ISIS that demand their submission? Sometimes, no doubt, they are coerced into compliance; sometimes, women participate in these extreme ideologies with enthusiasm. I wonder if some don't strap on a bomb as a merciful escape from miserable circumstances. But the important point is that we don't really know why women join terror groups that would deny them equality and opportunity. We also don't understand the full extent of women's involvement. We don't know if Boko Haram's female bombers were a fluke or the first of many. We don't know if the al-Khansaa Brigade is a one-off experiment or a model for future ISIS governance. We have seen, though, that jihadists use women to exploit incomplete understandings of terrorism. Women pass unsuspected where men don't; that makes them valuable fighters. We can't thwart every attack while watching just half the pieces on the board. Though women's involvement in terror seems to be on the rise, the tactic is old. Gillo Pontecorvo's 1966 film ""The Battle of Algiers"" lingered on the image of female militants applying French cosmetics—equal parts war paint and camouflage—while preparing to bomb French milk bars in support of Algeria's independence struggle. Sri Lanka's Tamil insurgency made extensive use of female suicide bombers; between 1987 and 2008, women were better represented among their Black Tiger suicide commandos than they now are in either house of the United States Congress. Today, social media is rife with female supporters of ISIS -- some of them Western citizens who have traveled to Syria to wed and support jihadists. It's time to wake up to the growing role of women. Terror groups clearly believe that jihad is a women's issue. The recruitment of women and girls is an important element of the modern threat landscape. In the pursuit of women's equality at home and abroad, we still struggle to complete what former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton referred to as ""the great unfinished business of the 21st century."" If the United States is to offer a narrative of opportunity to the world—and strategically it must—then that narrative must include women and girls. Terror groups will run out of female fighters when girls are protected from domineering violence, sex trafficking and child marriage, and given every opportunity to pursue a better path. Some critics of Clinton's tenure at the State Department have belittled her focus on women and girls -- as if the fate of half the world's population weren't an important subject for U.S. foreign policy. That indifference can't last. Increasingly, radicalism has a female face. Security issues are women's issues; women's issues, sure enough, are security issues.","Jane Harman: A series of attacks in Nigeria by female suicide bombers is alarming .

"(CNN) -- Dick Van Dyke thought Walt Disney wanted to see him about ""Mary Poppins"" because of his singing and dancing skills. But the legendary studio founder had something else in mind. Dick Van Dyke played Bert the chimney sweep in ""Mary Poppins."" ""He had heard me in an interview talking about what was happening to family entertainment,"" says Van Dyke in a phone interview, still amused by the memory. ""I was decrying the fact that it seemed like no holds were barred anymore in entertainment. ... That's why he called me in, because I said something he agreed with."" Disney, after years of cajoling ""Poppins"" author P.L. Travers, was finally mounting a production of the books about a magical nanny. With Van Dyke, he knew he was also getting a star as well as a like-minded performer. The actor's TV sitcom, ""The Dick Van Dyke Show,"" was a steady hit at the time, and he had won a Tony for his work in the stage version of ""Bye Bye Birdie."" With Van Dyke as the Cockney chimney sweep Bert, fellow Tony winner Julie Andrews (in her movie debut) as Poppins and several old pros in tow, Disney went ahead with production on the 1964 film, which was to become one of the biggest hits his studio ever produced. The movie earned five Oscars -- including a best actress win for Andrews -- and its Richard and Robert Sherman songs, such as ""Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious,"" ""Feed the Birds"" and the Oscar-winning ""Chim Chim Cher-ee,"" have become standards. Forty-five years later, ""Poppins"" is also a hit stage show, with excerpts of the Broadway production featured on a new 45th-anniversary DVD. Van Dyke, 83, took a few minutes to talk about the film, his much-maligned Cockney accent and Michelle Obama's fondness for his old TV show. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: Tell me about Walt Disney. People think of him as a brand name nowadays, but he was a real person and still alive when you made the film. Was he a presence on the set? Dick Van Dyke: Absolutely. He was very much into this and believed in it. He hung around the set a lot. And I'm happy to say he was so pleased with the way it was going, as we all were. CNN: How did you end up with the part of Bert? Van Dyke: Well, I thought he hired me because I was such a great singer and dancer. As it turns out, he had heard me in an interview talking about what was happening to family entertainment. I was decrying the fact that it seemed like no holds were barred anymore in entertainment. ... He knew about the ""Van Dyke Show,"" about our little sitcom, but that's why he called me in, because I said something he agreed with. And I got the part. CNN: ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" was still on at the time. Were you balancing the ""Van Dyke Show"" at the same time you did ""Poppins,"" or were you on hiatus? Van Dyke: It was on hiatus. That whole decade of the '60s, that's what I did for 10 years -- I did the show and then a movie, a show and then a movie. I felt I'd better make hay while the sun shined. ... It always worked out pretty well. But I found myself getting up in the morning and taking off on the freeway and forgetting where in the hell I was supposed to go, and a couple times I showed up at the wrong studio. CNN: You've taken a lot of ribbing over the years for your Cockney accent. Van Dyke: Oh, have I ever. CNN: Did Andrews or David Tomlinson [who played Mr. Banks] mention things to you about the accent? Or did they just go with the flow? Van Dyke: They just went with the flow! It's funny -- I was concentrating on the dancing, mostly, and they had given me a [voice] coach who turned out to be an Irishman, and his Cockney wasn't much better than mine. During the making of the picture nobody kidded me about the accent, but I sure took it afterwards. [One British poll named Van Dyke's accent the second-worst British accent ever; Van Dyke observes, however, that he was beaten out by Sean Connery's ""Untouchables"" performance.] . CNN: Tell me about the way the movie was shot. There were a lot of scenes with animated characters, and today those would be shot with a blue screen or computer animation. Van Dyke: I think it's such a shame that Walt didn't live to see computer animation, because he would have had a good time with it. ... In those days it was before the blue screen. They used what was called yellow sulphur lighting -- the screen was yellow, and we worked with that all day, and by the time the day was over you couldn't see anything. ... It was just an empty soundstage. And sometimes we didn't even have the music -- we would just dance to a click rhythm. But I think technically it holds up today just as well as anything. CNN: Did you know what some of the animated sequences were going to be? Van Dyke: Yes, that was in the script. But I had to go to Walt and talk him into letting me do the old [bank president]. I said, I'll do that part and I won't even charge you. So he made me do a little screen test and gave me the part. ... And he didn't pay me -- I had to donate $4,000 to his CalArts school. He was a little horse trader. CNN: You worked with Ed Wynn in the film, and I know you're a huge fan of the old comedians. What was Wynn like? Van Dyke: He was in his [late 70s] at the time, and not very well. He did all that ""I Love to Laugh"" stuff hanging from the ceiling, and it was just so hard on him, but he was a trouper. He was a sweet old guy. He had a palsy -- his head would move from side to side, kind of involuntarily. But the minute they would say ""Action,"" it would stop. And he'd do the scene, and the minute they said ""Cut,"" it would start in again. CNN: Let me change gears. Michelle Obama has said that ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" is one of her favorite shows. Van Dyke: I've heard that, and I sent them a note and said, ""Thank you for making me famous all over again."" I call them the black Rob and Laura. CNN: Is it nice that so much of your work has had longevity? Van Dyke: I just lucked into working with geniuses like [""Van Dyke Show"" creator] Carl Reiner and Walt. I just lucked out.","""Mary Poppins"" came out 45 years ago; won five Oscars, including best actress .

"(CNN) -- Ricardo Benejam is a born-and-bred New Yorker. He grew up with a view of the World Trade Center from the window of his childhood apartment in lower Manhattan. On September 11, 2001, he was a freshman in high school when the twin towers fell. ""I had actually blurted out, 'We'll be going to war,'"" he recalls. ""You knew it wasn't an accident. That was my first thought at 14 [years old]."" He witnessed the devastation firsthand as he walked home that day. ""I saw cars that were littered with dust,"" he said. ""I saw people in business suits that were littered in dust."" Before the attack, Benejam was considering a career in law enforcement or the military. His father, who died of a heart attack in 2002, worked briefly for the New York City Police Department, and his uncle served in the Navy during the Vietnam War. In 2006, the day before his 19th birthday, Benejam was sworn into the U.S. Army. ""One of the main reasons was a promise that I kept to my father that I would enlist,"" Benejam said, ""and the second reason was the 9/11 attacks. I definitely wanted to serve as a result of that."" Benejam was stationed in Ft. Drum, New York, where he trained as a human resources specialist. He first deployed to Afghanistan for three months in 2007. He went back in 2009, this time staying a full year. ""I did my job,"" said Benejam. ""I did what I was sent to do and I supported those guys in my unit."" In 2011, his service ended. He set his sights on continuing his education and working, but coming home wasn't easy. ""The first week or so, I'd be waking up and I'm like, 'I'm going to be late for formation,'"" remembers Benejam. ""And I'm like, 'There's no more formation.'"" Families face more challenges when military parents return . Benejam credits the work ethic he learned in the Army with his success at home, saying, ""I think what actually helped me transition a little bit better is that I started school right after I got out."" He is just two semesters away from getting his bachelor's degree in criminal justice from Monroe College in the Bronx. Benejam visits ground zero several times a week now, not just to pay respect to his fellow veterans or to reflect on the events that inspired him to serve his country. He works at the 9/11 Memorial. ""Working down there, it's like you're continuing to serve because you're telling the story of what happened and what was there before,"" he said. Part of what makes his job so special is the bond he shares with other veterans visiting the site. ""You meet a veteran, and it's almost like seeing a brother or sister,"" Benejam said. ""A lot of us have deployed (as a result of) what happened on 9/11."" On the day CNN visited Benejam at the 9/11 Memorial, he was answering visitors' questions about the ""Survivor Tree."" ""It's the only tree that actually survived the initial attacks,"" he explains. ""It actually survived not only the attacks itself but already two nor'easters and two hurricanes."" Benejam, too, is a survivor. He's thriving in his post-military life. When CNN asked what advice he would offer to other veterans coming home, his reply was reflective and hopeful, much like memorial where he works. ""It may start off rocky, but, you know, there's light at the end of the tunnel. Just stay positive, and good things will happen.""","Ricardo Benejam was born and raised in New York City and saw the twin towers fall .

"(CNN) -- Lawyers for a man accused of kidnapping Utah teenager Elizabeth Smart rested their case Thursday afternoon, a day after the young woman stormed out of court during testimony. Federal prosecutors are expected to follow the defense with several days of rebuttal testimony against Brian Mitchell, who is charged with snatching Smart from the bedroom of her family's Salt Lake City home in 2002. Mitchell, 57, is charged with kidnapping and unlawful transportation of a minor across state lines. Nine months after her abduction, Smart was found in the company of Mitchell -- a drifter and self-described ""prophet"" who called himself Immanuel -- and his wife, Wanda Barzee. Defense attorneys are mounting an insanity defense for Mitchell, hoping to prove that he did not understand his actions were wrong when he abducted Smart. Smart abruptly left the courtroom during Wednesday's testimony by defense witness Paul Whitehead, a forensic psychiatrist who treated Mitchell, CNN affiliate KSTU reported. Whitehead testified about Mitchell's desire to bear children with Smart, who was 14 at the time of her abduction, the affiliate said. ""Mr. Mitchell was talking with Ms. Smart about having babies to the point where Ms. Smart actually picked out a name in case that happened,"" Whitehead testified. That statement prompted Smart's departure, followed by that of her mother. Mitchell's trial was halted Tuesday after he suffered apparent seizures in court. Before the seizures, the suspect was singing Christmas carols when he was led into the courtroom. He then began to wail and dropped to the floor, the affiliate said. Defense attorney Robert Steele said Smart had testified that the suspect suffered a seizure during her time in captivity. ""We watched a seizure,"" he said, according to KSTU. When a reporter asked whether ""it really happened,"" Steele replied, ""Yes, yes."" Prosecutors have said they have up to five days of rebuttal witnesses, but both sides assured the judge they would finish closing arguments by December 10.","NEW: Defense rests; prosecution rebuttal could take five days .

"(CNN) -- The blue neon light of a Hollywood comedy club appears blurry in the lens of Mujeeb Arez's HD camcorder as he steadies it in his hand. It's almost 9 p.m. on a Tuesday, and he is shooting his documentary after a full day of classes at the University of Southern California. He adjusts the focus to bring his subject into clear view, the way his instructors trained him. Meanwhile, his colleague and good friend, Taimor Najib, holds the boom mic up and out of the shot as Arez begins his interview. The techniques they're putting to practice are the same as they will use when they return to their home in Kabul, Afghanistan, to produce television for the Afghan people. ""We don't have any professional production school in Afghanistan,"" Najib said. ""I need to make some professional commercials to change TV and change the people's minds over there from being basic to being professional."" Arez and Najib, both 24, arrived in Los Angeles from Afghanistan in June to study for six weeks at one of the premiere film schools. The USC program, now in its second year, enrolls just two Afghan students in cinema courses during the summer for a crash course in storytelling, camera techniques, lighting, editing and commercial production. Saving Face: The struggle and survival of Afghan women . ""What we're able to do is bring two people who have had sparse training in broadcasting, bring them here and turn them loose in a film class that lasts six weeks and it's intensive,"" said David Weitzner, director of the USC School of Cinematic Arts Summer Program. The program is largely funded by former Viacom CEO Tom Freston, who owns a private company that invests and consults in the media and entertainment businesses. But in the 1970s, Freston was in the clothing business, living and working in Kabul, where he developed a lasting connection to Afghanistan. ""I was lucky enough to have lived there and build a great affinity and understanding for the people, who I think are kind of misrepresented in the world in the last 10, 20, 30 years,"" Freston said. ""This is a moment for them to continue to really move forward and break out and join the world community."" In light of the ongoing conflict that news organizations center on, Najib and Arez have wondered how their classmates view the country they call home. ""I've asked my class fellows and also I've asked my professor about it,"" Najib said. ""And they're still thinking that about the Taliban and the al Qaeda, but I told them no, actually it's not the same thing now. Afghanistan is totally changed now."" The TV industry is at a critical juncture in Afghanistan. Under the Taliban, there was no television, and today 60% of people have access to broadcast media, according to Weitzner. It has increasingly become the primary source of entertainment and information for Afghans, he said. More than half the population is still illiterate, but Freston said Afghans are discovering educational value in a show with which many Americans are familiar: ""Sesame Street."" ""We find there's a very big adult population that watches that and learns how to count and speak."" ""People in Afghanistan don't go out a lot for dinner, they don't have a lot of the leisure activities that we do, so they stay home and watch television,"" Freston said, adding that sometimes families rely on car batteries to power their television sets. With a sense of the power of television to create a sense of national unity, Freston and the program administrators hope Arez and Najib will hit the ground running in Afghanistan and have an immediate effect on the growing audience of television consumers. ""These two young men are going to go back into that world and further accelerate that change through the very effective medium of television by creating television in Afghanistan by Afghans for Afghans,"" Freston said. ""When I go back to my country, I will share everything that I learned here with my colleagues,"" Arez said. ""That will help them also to work professionally in production and for TV and media."" Arez's documentary, ""An Engineer Became a Comedian,"" deals with the theme of following one's passion rather than money. The film profiles a stand-up comic whose parents wouldn't pay for college unless he studied medicine, law or engineering. So he became an aerospace engineer by day and worked on perfecting his stand-up routine by night. ""This same thing is happening also in Afghanistan,"" Arez said. ""They push their daughter and son to study the field that their parents want."" ""I am one of the lucky guys that always had my family support me to work in TV.""","Student hopes to use TV to help those in Afghanistan .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan understands the need to move ""urgently and transparently"" against extremists on its soil after last week's terrorist attacks in India, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said after meetings with Pakistani leaders. Condoleezza Rice meets Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani to discuss the Mumbai attacks. ""I found a Pakistani government that's focused on the threat and understands its responsibility to respond to terrorism and extremism wherever it is found,"" Rice told reporters Thursday after sessions with the country's president and prime minister. After the talks, Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari pledged to assist in the investigation and move against ""any Pakistani elements found involved in the attack,"" his office said. Rice landed in Islamabad in an effort to ease tensions between India and Pakistan following the terrorist attacks in India's financial capital Mumbai. Indian authorities have said the gunmen who killed nearly 180 people came from Pakistan, but Pakistan has blamed ""non-state actors"" for the attacks. Rice said the discussions focused on the attacks and what she called Pakistan's obligation ""to deal with those who may use Pakistani territory, even if they are non-state actors."" ""There does need to be action,"" she said. ""There needs to be action urgently and transparently. And it's a message that has been well-received in Pakistan, because it's Pakistan's fight as well."" Pakistan is a U.S. ally in the battle against the Taliban and al Qaeda in Afghanistan -- a conflict that has spread into northwestern Pakistan. Rice's visit to Islamabad came a day after Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, met with Zardari and top military and intelligence officials in Islamabad. India has said a Pakistan-based Islamic militant group with ties to al Qaeda helped plot the Mumbai attacks and says the sole surviving attacker is a Pakistani national. The group, Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, is the same one New Delhi accused of carrying out a 2001 attack on its parliament that brought the South Asian nuclear powers to the brink of war.  Watch claims attackers came from Pakistan » . India has demanded Pakistan hand over a group of wanted terrorist suspects. Its foreign minister, Pranab Mukherjee, warned that India will consider all options ""to protect its territorial integrity"" if Pakistan refuses. ""So far as the government of India is concerned, what action will be taken by government will depend on the response we have from Pakistan authorities,"" Mukherjee said. Rice met with Mukherjee on Wednesday. While she said Pakistan needs to cooperate with the investigation into the Mumbai massacre, she warned India that ""any response needs to be judged by its effectiveness in prevention, and also by not creating other unintended consequences or difficulties."" U.S. Joint Chiefs Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen warned Thursday of the ""increasingly sophisticated threat of militant extremism in South Asia,"" and urged India and Pakistan to collaborate against a common enemy. America's top military officer is in New Delhi, for talks with senior Indian civilian and military leaders. According to a statement issued by Mullen's Pentagon office, the admiral thanked Indian officials ""for their restraint and their desire to cooperate with Pakistani officials"" and repeated an offer by U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to help in the investigation of the Mumbai attacks which killed 179 people. In India, Mullen met with National Security Advisor M. K. Narayanan, Defense Minister A. K. Antony, and Naval Chief Adm. Sureesh Mehta.","Condoleezza Rice: Pakistan knows it has to act urgently .

"(CNN) -- Two former World Cup champions face off Thursday in Brazil, but neither England nor Uruguay have been in dominant form lately. They both lost their first matches this year and will be hungry for a win to keep hopes alive of advancing to the knockout round of the competition. England, the 1966 champions, have lost their last two World Cup matches. Uruguay, who have won the World Cup twice, have lost their last three matches. Uruguay holds the distinction of being the only champion who didn't defend its crown. The South American nation hosted and won the 1930 tournament, but refused to participate in 1934 in Italy because the Italians didn't show up four years earlier. It's already clear that the defending champions this year will not be repeating their triumph. Spain, the dominant national team in European and world football for most of the past decade, crashed out of the World Cup in shocking style Wednesday night, with a 2-0 loss to Chile that makes it impossible for the title holders to advance to the knockout stage of the tournament. It was a surprise result, but arguably not an unusual one: The Spanish are the fifth defending champions to be eliminated in the group stage of the World Cup. That's more than a quarter of all title holders ever to to try to repeat. It's more common for a defending champ not to make it to the knockout stage than to win the World Cup twice in a row. Champions who went out early: . Italy: Won in 1938, eliminated in 1950 (there were no World Cups in between because of World War II) Brazil: won in 1962, eliminated in 1966 .

"(CNN) -- Escalating violence between Syrian security forces and anti-government protesters claimed 15 people Wednesday in the city of Daraa, witnesses and rights activists said. Syrian state television reported the government fired the governor of Daraa province, a flash point of anti-government protests. There was no breakdown on the casualties. According to activists and witnesses, seven people died shortly after dawn prayers near al Omari mosque. Security personnel tried to storm the area where protesters took positions to demand government reforms, an opposition spokesman said. Later, about 3,000 protesters from neighboring towns gathered outside Daraa and clashed with an army unit known for its loyalty to President Bashar al-Assad, activists and witnesses said. The army unit is headed by a family member, Maher al-Assad, said the opposition spokesman. Eight more people died in the later clashes, bringing the death toll Wednesday to 15, according to the sources. Overall, at least 21 people have died in unrest in the city since Friday. Army tanks are positioned in the city, including near al Omari mosque, the opposition spokesman said. Mobile and regular telephone service from Daraa has been cut off, witnesses told CNN. Wissam Tarif, executive director of the human rights group Insan, told CNN from outside Damascus that Syrian security forces fired live ammunition at unarmed protesters. He said he was aware of three protesters killed in the clashes, but added there was no information on the injured because people don't go to the hospitals anymore. This is because some disappeared after being taken for treatment earlier in the unrest, he said. According to Tarif, demonstrators want an end to the decades-old state of emergency in Syria, the release of prisoners of conscience and more freedoms. Syria is the latest in a string of Arabic-speaking nations beset with discontent over human rights issues. ""The United States is deeply troubled by violence and civilian deaths in Daraa at the hands of security forces,"" State Department spokesman Mark Toner said in a statement Wednesday. His statement expressed U.S. condemnation for what it called ""the Syrian government's use of violence, intimidation and arbitrary arrests in Daraa to hinder the ability of its people to freely exercise their universal rights. ""We call on the Syrian government to exercise restraint and refrain from violence against peaceful protesters,"" Toner's statement said. A witness who did not want his name used out of concern for his safety said security forces shot into the crowd in front of the al Omari mosque before daybreak Wednesday. The witness also said he heard an explosion. Syrian state TV, however, said armed groups had attacked security forces, killing a doctor, a medical assistant and an ambulance driver. Assad later issued an order to dismiss Daraa's governor, Faisal Kulthoum, from his position, Syrian state TV reported. The violence comes a day after Syrian authorities arrested a prominent rights leader as anti-government demonstrations continue throughout the country's south. Loay Hussein, a political prisoner from 1984 to 1991, was taken from his home in the Sehnaya district near Damascus on Tuesday, according to the country's Observatory for Human Rights. Hussein had been supporting protesters who marched for a sixth straight day Tuesday, chanting, ""The people want to bring down the regime,"" a spokesman for the organizers told CNN from Daraa. The organizers are also planning a day of mass protests Friday, the spokesman said. On Monday, protesters marched in Daraa after they buried the body of a protester who was killed Sunday in clashes between anti-government demonstrators and security forces, a witness told CNN. Sunday's protests came the same day a delegation sent by the president offered ""condolences to the families of the two martyrs who died during the unfortunate events which took place in Daraa on Friday,"" according to SANA, the Syrian news agency. Local tribal leaders have said they rejected a government proposal to bring about calm and have put together a list of demands, including asking that the head of the local police and governor of Daraa be held accountable for the civilian casualties since Friday, witnesses said. On Tuesday, the United Nations Human Rights office reported that six people have been killed by security forces in Daraa since Friday, calling for an ""independent, transparent and effective investigation into these killings."" ""The use of excessive force constitutes a clear violation of international law, which provides for individual criminal responsibility for violations committed,"" said Rupert Colville, spokesman for the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. ""People have the legitimate right to express their grievances and demands to their government, and we urge the Syrian government to enter into a broad, meaningful dialogue with the protesters in an attempt to address those grievances,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Sony has uncovered a file that could link Anonymous, the highly visible renegade hacker group, to a breach that led to the theft of personal information for as many as 101 million people, the company wrote in a letter to the U.S. Congress. During the investigations, which have gone on for two weeks so far with many online networks offline, Sony discovered a file on its system named Anonymous that contained the group's sort of catchphrase, ""We are Legion,"" wrote Kazuo Hirai, the Sony Computer Entertainment president and America division chairman. The file was found on a server managed by Sony Online Entertainment, a subsidiary that makes online multiplayer games for the computer and PlayStation 3. Sony Online originally thought it was unaffected by the intrusions that hit sister companies, but investigators found that its data, too, was taken during the two-day attack last month. Sony Online, which sells subscription-based games such as ""EverQuest"" and ""DC Universe Online,"" took its systems offline Monday morning at 4:38 a.m. ET and disclosed the intrusion later that day, a spokeswoman said. The Anonymous file was discovered on Sunday, after Sony found that data had been taken from Sony Online's servers, but she declined to say why the company didn't initially mention the file. Anonymous has gained international notoriety over the last several years for its computer-security attacks on major companies. The group has gone after MasterCard, Visa, the Church of Scientology and government websites for Tunisia and Egypt. Many of the targets are chosen for political or philosophical reasons. Sony found itself in Anonymous' crosshairs early last month in retaliation for suing two people who were distributing instructions showing how to hack a PlayStation 3 game system. Hirai said in his letter that Anonymous members collaborated to overload Sony's servers, a practice of constantly pinging a Web address called a denial of service attack. ""You have abused the judicial system in an attempt to censor information on how your products work,"" a representative for the group wrote in a public letter to Sony posted on its website. ""In doing so you have violated the privacy of thousands of innocent people who only sought the free distribution of information."" Now Sony is suggesting Anonymous helped facilitate the theft of millions of people's private data. ""This cyberattack came shortly after Sony Computer Entertainment America was the subject of denial of service attacks launched against several Sony companies and threats made against both Sony and its executives,"" Hirai wrote in the response to a congressional inquiry. ""Whether those who participated in the denial of service attacks were conspirators or whether they were simply duped into providing cover for a very clever thief, we may never know."" Anonymous posted an update to its website after Sony shut down its PlayStation Network and Qriocity media streaming service, titled ""For Once We Didn't Do It."" The statement read: ""While it could be the case that other Anons have acted by themselves AnonOps wa (sic) not related to this incident and takes no responsiblity (sic) for it."" Sony says it is working with the Federal Bureau of Investigations and security experts to analyze the situation. They haven't yet identified the people responsible for the breach, Hirai wrote.","Sony says it found a file linking the Anonymous hacker group to a recent attack .

"(CNN) -- NASA said Friday's rocket and satellite strike on the moon was a success, kicking up enough dust for scientists to determine whether or not there is water on the moon. An artist's rendering shows the LCROSS spacecraft, left, separating from its Centaur rocket. ""We have the data we need to actually address the questions we set out to address,"" said Anthony Colaprete, principal investigator for the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite, or LCROSS, mission. It will be awhile before all the data from the satellite can be analyzed to determine if there is water on the moon, according to LCROSS project manager Dan Andrews. Andrews said that ""the spacecraft performed beautifully."" NASA crashed the rocket and a satellite into the moon's surface on Friday morning in a $79 million mission. NASA televised live images of the LCROSS as it crashed into a crater near the moon's south pole. Watch as NASA reacts to ""successful"" crash » . Minutes before its impact, the satellite guided a rocket into the Cabeus crater in an effort to kick up enough dust to help the LCROSS find whether there is any water in the moon's soil. The Centaur upper-stage rocket impacted the moon shortly after 7:30 a.m. ET, and the satellite followed it four minutes later. The LCROSS carried spectrometers, near-infrared cameras, a visible camera and a visible radiometer to help NASA scientists analyze the resulting plumes of dust -- more than 250 metric tons' worth -- for water vapor. But immediate NASA images of the crash produced no sign of the plumes, which were expected to rise six kilometers from the moon's surface, said John Marmie, LCROSS deputy project manager. ""Everyone was like, 'What's happening here?' "" Marmie said. ""But that doesn't mean we don't have good data there."" Observatories on Earth did confirm they saw plumes after the crashes, Marmie said.  Watch as a mission official explains the importance of finding water » . The orbiting Hubble Space Telescope and NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter photographed the impacts. Meanwhile, hundreds of telescopes on Earth focused on the moon, hoping to catch a glimpse of two plumes. The Cabeus crater lies in permanent shadow, making observations inside the crater difficult. NASA Deputy Administrator Lori Garver, who watched at a public event at the Newseum in Washington, noted the great interest in the NASA mission. ""We had families ... literally coming in off the street"" to watch, Garver said on NASA TV. iReport: Did you watch? NASA had encouraged amateur astronomers to join the watch parties. ""We expect the debris plumes to be visible through midsized backyard telescopes -- 10 inches and larger,"" said Brian Day at NASA's Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, California, before the strike. Day is an amateur astronomer who is leading education and public outreach for the LCROSS mission. Ames -- which led the mission -- hosted an all-night event featuring music and food before the broadcast of NASA's live transmission of the lunar impact. Other science observatories and amateur astronomy clubs across the country hosted similar events.  Watch CNN's Jeanne Moos ask if lunacy is behind the moon ""bombing"" » . ""The initial explosions will probably be hidden behind crater walls, but the plumes will rise high enough above the crater's rim to be seen from Earth,"" Day said. Data from previous space missions have revealed trace amounts of water in lunar soil. The LCROSS mission seeks a definitive answer to the question of how much water is present. NASA has said it believes water on the moon could be a valuable resource in the agency's quest to explore the solar system. LCROSS launched with the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter aboard an Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on June 18.","NEW: Rocket impact generated enough data to study, NASA says .

"(CNN) -- Trick-or-treating and dressing in costume have been Halloween traditions for a good long time now, but it seems we're still struggling to get it right. We pass judgment on the ghouls and goblins at our front steps. We bang on the doors of darkened houses. We show up to parties in offensive costumes. So here are a few Halloween PSAs, six not-so-gentle reminders of how to keep in the holiday spirit alive and sugared up. Read them, memorize them, share them and have your happiest Halloween yet. Give goodies to any child who shows up at the door . Halloween night is not the time to quibble over the quality of trick-or-treaters' costumes or whether some kids are too old to ask for free candy. And don't even bother questioning whether they're from your neighborhood, as if visitors don't deserve your Snickers. Last week, a letter to Slate's Dear Prudence columnist, Emily Yoffe, said the majority of trick-or-treaters in the advice seeker's wealthy neighborhood appeared to be from poorer areas. ""It just bugs me, because we already pay more than enough taxes toward actual social services,"" the letter writer said. ""Should Halloween be a neighborhood activity, or is it legitimately a free-for-all in which people hunt down the best candy grounds for their kids?"" The rules on this are pretty obvious, as Yoffe pointed out: ""Stop being callous and miserly and go to Costco, you cheapskate, and get enough candy to fill the bags of the kids who come one day a year to marvel at how the 1% live."" Too cool for a costume? Don't go to a costume party. You don't have to like Halloween. You don't have to welcome trick-or-treaters. You don't have to pretend to enjoy parties where the main courses are caramel apples and candy corn. (More for us!) But if you decide to attend your pal's costume party, at least put a modicum of effort into it. It's not hard. Showing up in your work clothes and saying, ""I'm an underappreciated ______ (accountant, server, journalist etc.),"" just isn't clever. If you truly can't be bothered and can't wait till plainclothes parties return next weekend, at least keep the snark to a minimum. Everyone is just trying to have a little fun. It's a culture, not a costume . No blackface, no whiteface, no religious symbols, no American Indian garb ... shall we go on? Every year on Halloween, an insensitive or ignorant few fail miserably in their attempts to be edgy or clever or funny. When celebrities do this, it spurs a relentless cycle of online rage, hole-digging defenses and public apologies. It's not any prettier when it happens at your neighborhood Halloween bash, your lighthearted college kegger or in your kids' class party. In recent years, students at Ohio University even created a viral campaign to remind their classmates that poking fun at race or ethnicity isn't actually funny. Still, it seems every year that a few miss (or ignore?) the message. Don't be one of them. Costumes don't have to be sexy . Halloween can be the perfect time for adults to show off a little something saucy. If that's your aim, go ahead. But don't do it because it seems easy or like it's the only option. After all, showing up as a barely clothed version of a not-even-kind-of-sexy thing isn't hot. It's ... awkward and, at this point, not surprising -- all the supposedly sexy gerbils, crayons and Girl Scouts of Halloweens past beat you to it. Also: Brrr. Isn't it October where you live, you weirdly ""sexy"" bottle of ketchup? If you're feeling like ""sexy"" costumes are the only thing available, check out the ideas at Take Back Halloween. It offers up costume plans the average adult partygoer can pull off with a stretch of Spandex required. On this dark and stormy night, look for the light . It's a very simple bit of Halloween communication, more powerful than all the trick-or-treating apps and maps out there: the porch light. If it's on, feel free to knock at the door or ring the bell once, screech your best ""Trick or treat!"" (or tell a joke, or whatever your local candy-grabbing custom may be) and gratefully accept whatever treats you're offered. If the light is off, move along. And needless to say, don't egg the house. Potential candy-givers shouldn't forget this rule, either. You don't want to send packs of Ninja Turtles and ""Frozen"" princesses away empty-handed -- or end up eating your jumbo-size bag of Smarties by yourself. Or do you? Spooky decor expires on November 1 . Unless you're committing to a haunted look all year long, there's a clear expiration date on your Halloween decorations: November 1. (Fine, fine. On years when Halloween falls early in the week, you get a few extra days -- but only through the next weekend. You're welcome.) Don't be that neighbor trying to pass off your soggy faux cobwebs as holiday icicles. So, take a few minutes this weekend to compost your pumpkins and sweep up your spiders. You might even feel a little behind: Store shelves are already buckling beneath the weight of plastic trees and inflatable snowmen.","Every Halloween, people ignore a few rules that will help keep the holiday happy .

"(CNN) -- Could one of aviation's most enduring mysteries be solved? An aircraft recovery group says it may already have a part of Amelia Earhart's plane, and it thinks it knows where to find the rest of it. The International Historic Aircraft Recovery Group says new testing of a piece of metal found in the vast waters of the Pacific Ocean in 1991 gives the group ""increasing confidence"" that it's a part of the Lockheed Electra. In a press release the group argues that the aluminum debris is likely a patch that Earhart had put on her plane in place of a window. The group says the patch had a distinctive shape, size and ""pattern of rivets."" ""The patch was as unique to her particular aircraft as a fingerprint is to an individual,"" the group wrote. Now the groups says research on the aluminum ""matches that fingerprint in many respects."" Erhart's Lockheed Electra never made it back from an attempt to circle the globe in 1937. Deserted island theory . Over the years many theories have emerged. For example: Earhart's plane was forced down by the Japanese around the Marshall Islands. Or even, Earhart secretly returned to the United States and the government gave her a new identity. But International Historic Aircraft Recovery Group has developed its own theory. The Pennsylvania-based group believes Earhart actually landed safely. The groups says she and her navigator Fred Noonan set the plane down on a reef on a deserted island in the Pacific called Nikumaroro. The group lays out what it thinks happened next in its press release: Earhart ""sent radio distress calls for at least five nights before the Electra was washed into the ocean by rising tides and surf leaving Earhart and Noonan cast away on the uninhabited atoll."" The group, which operates as a nonprofit, isn't deterred by the fact that its previous searches of the area in 2010 and 2012 turned up no debris. That's because the group thinks the plane may be resting in mostly one piece. International Historic Aircraft Recovery Group came up empty two years ago, but it thinks during that search it may have uncovered the plane itself. ""Several months after the 2012 expedition a member of TIGHAR's online Amelia Earhart Search Forum spotted an unusual feature in the sonar imagery,"" the group says. Six hundred feet below the waves, at the base of a cliff, the group detected an ""anomaly in the underwater topography."" An anomaly . Further analysis shows, the group says, an object the ""right size and shape"" of Electra's fuselage. It's not the first time this group has made a splash with its findings. When it first discovered sonar imagery of the ""anomaly"" the group got tepid reaction from Louise Foudray, caretaker and historian of the Amelia Earhart Birthplace Museum. ""We don't want to shrug off the hard work anyone is doing. We do like the idea that people are still interested,"" she said at the time. ""But we're skeptical."" And the group itself isn't ready to say for sure it has cracked this cold case. ""Is the anomaly the aircraft?"" the group asks. ""The only way to know is to go look."" And in June of 2015 the groups says it will spend 24 days doing just that.","Aircraft recovery group says metal piece may be from Amelia Earhart's plane .

"(CNN) -- Tod Purvis and his brother Justin knew that they were going blind. Both had been diagnosed with choroideremia, a rare genetic disorder that causes progressive vision loss and eventually leads to complete blindness. So six years ago, the brothers went on a road trip across the United States. A documentary about their journey, ""Driving Blind,"" was released this year after winning awards at independent film festivals in 2013. On the documentary's website, the filmmakers had this to say: . ""We started filming under the impression that Tod and Justin had at least half of their eyesight left. It is revealed at the end that their eyesight was much much worse, and in truth the trip or film would have never happened had we knew they would in fact be driving blind. Justin was declared legally blind at the conclusion of the trip."" Child goes on 'bucket list' trip before he goes blind . Tod Purvis took to the Internet community Reddit on Sunday to conduct an AMA (Ask Me Anything) about their trip, the documentary and choroideremia. The most beautiful place they visited? Devil's Tower in Wyoming, Purvis said. The second? Glacier Park in Montana. ""We took the trip to put the memories in our brain where we could always call them up even if we completely lost our sight,"" Purvis posted. Choroideremia affects approximately 1 in every 50,000 people, according to the Choroideremia Research Foundation. It primarily occurs in males and starts in early childhood. It is caused by a gene mutation and is passed on to children via the X chromosome, according to the National Institutes of Health. ""Without the protein produced by the CHM gene, pigment cells in the retina of the eye slowly stop working, then die off,"" according to NLO, a center for eye research at the University of Oxford. ""As the disease progresses, the surviving retina gradually shrinks in size, reducing vision."" Purvis said that his sight is down to about 50% but had difficulty describing what losing it was like to Reddit users. ""It's hard to describe nothing. It's not black, it's like if you were looking through a tunnel, and the walls of the tunnel were made of mirrors and it reflected what was at the end of the tunnel."" Purvis wrapped up the AMA after more than 600 comments, never wavering from the documentary's main message: . ""No matter what your situation ... live your life to the fullest.""","Brothers diagnosed with choroideremia knew they were going blind .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- As well as their potential for creating effective therapies for debilitating diseases, embryonic stem cells could open the door to improved pharmaceutical drug testing, according to a leading British stem cell researcher. Embryonic stem cells seen pictured through a microscope viewfinder in a laboratory. Speaking at a recent meeting of the British Pharmacological Society in Brighton, UK, Christine Mummery described how using embryonic stem cells to create human heart cells could be a viable and scientifically exciting alternative to animal testing. Mummery, a Professor of Developmental Biology at Leiden University Medical Center in The Netherlands told CNN: ""It could save a lot of time and effort of taking the wrong drugs through, or it may allow drugs through which are lost at an early stage, because they affect the animal cells but don't have an effect on human cells. ""It may also allow more and better drugs to come through the first tests or flag up safety issues at an earlier stage."" Drug development is an incredibly expensive and protracted process. Typically, it costs around $1 billion to bring a new drug to market and the whole process usually takes about ten years. Before new drugs can go forward for clinical trials, it's necessary for the chemical compounds which make up a drug to undergo thousands of tests for toxicity before beginning trials on animals -- initially on rodents and then often on dogs. It's here, at this ethically sensitive stage, that Professor Mummery believes stem cell research could transform drug development. ""Many drugs are designed to affect the heart deliberately, controlling beats and rates of contraction,"" said Mummery, who specializes in converting embryonic stem cells into cardiac and vascular cells. But, as she points out, plenty of drugs designed to treat other complaints can also have negative side effects on the heart -- the painkiller Vioxx being a notable example. ""It's really important for the pharmaceutical industry to have proper test systems to pick those sorts of things up,"" she said. Merck & Co withdrew Vioxx in 2004 because of concerns over increased risk of stroke and heart attacks. Lawsuits filed against the company have cost them billions of dollars and many litigants still await their day in court. Stem cell based drug testing is already being promoted in the UK with the public/private initiative ""Stem Cells for Safer Medicine"" which was set up in 2007. It's something Mummery hopes will be replicated in other countries and particularly in the U.S. under President-elect Obama who is a proponent of stem cell research. A 2007 sabbatical at the Harvard Stem Cell Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts gave Mummery first-hand experience of the ethical debates that have engulfed stem cell research debates in the U.S.. ""I was shocked at the light years we are away from the way people think about embryonic stem cells in the States,"" she said. ""It's very mixed up with the abortion issue. It's put into the same category."" Public funding, or the lack of it, under President George W. Bush has also stymied research. ""What's happened in the U.S. is that people have become very frustrated and a lot of private initiatives -- like the Harvard Stem Cell Institute -- were started up to circumvent the lack of National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding. NIH researchers are either left behind or have a huge administrative burden,"" Mummery said. ""You go into a lab in the States and they say; 'this is our NIH lab, and this is our other lab'. They have to buy one microscope to look at NIH lines and another to look at other lines. They have to administer all the stem cells separately. There are even dotted lines in a lab which you can and cannot cross. It's completely ridiculous,"" she said. Drug company interest in stem cell drug testing was demonstrated in July 2008, when GlaxoSmithKline entered into a $25 million-plus agreement with the Harvard Stem Cell Institute. Commenting on the deal, Professor Patrick Vallance, Head of Drug Discovery at GSK said: ""GSK believes stem cell science has great potential to aid the discovery of new medicines by improving the screening, identification and development of new compounds."" Drug testing is an emotive subject not least because of animal testing. So how have anti-vivisectionists greeted the news? Chief Executive at the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection (BUAV), Michelle Thew told CNN: ""We have some concerns about the technology in general because it will still use animal cells and animals, but we are positive about things which may reduce the numbers of live animals in testing."" Clearly, the BUAV would like to do away with all animal testing altogether. Their obvious ethical objections, are backed up by questions about its efficacy. ""One of issues with drug development,"" Thew said, ""is that animal testing is not very successful at getting drugs through the process because a lot of the tests aren't very predictive. They are also very expensive and time-consuming."" Even if stem cell drug testing does mark the beginning of the end for animal testing, the ethical vacuum is already being filled by another storm of controversy surrounding the use of embryonic stem cells. But, as Mummery points out, these objections will disappear should researchers from Japan and the U.S. continue to improve on early successes in creating stem cells from skin cells. Whatever the debate, the fact is at the moment, says Mummery, there are very few new drugs coming on to the market in the European Union. ""The drug companies are very nervous about the costs involved and the risks,"" she said. ""If there was a reliable system to flag up issues they would be much more confident of taking drugs through to market.""","Leading UK stem cell expert calls for embryonic stem cells to be used to test drugs .

"(CNN) -- Speaking Saturday at the Summit of the Americas, President Barack Obama said it is reasonable to debate alternatives in the war on drugs, but insisted legalizing drugs wasn't a valid option in the United States. Obama voiced his view in his first public remarks at the hemispheric event during a meeting of business leaders, where he was part of a panel alongside Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff and Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos. The possibility of drug legalization has gained traction in Central America, which is being squeezed between suppliers to the south and consumers to the north. Yet the idea goes against decades of the prohibitionist policy backed by the United States, which is largely followed and enforced in Latin America and the Caribbean. Santos noted Saturday that people in his native Colombia, too, have called for different ways to approach illicit drugs. ""Sometimes we pedal and pedal and pedal, and we feel like we are on a stationary bike,"" he said of the war on drugs. ""I think the time has come to simply analyze if what we are doing is the best we could be doing, or if we can find an alternative that would be more effective and less costly to society. This is a topic of extreme political sensitivity."" He added, ""One extreme can be to put all users in prison. On the other extreme, legalization. In the middle there may be more practical policies, such as decriminalizing consumption but putting all the efforts into interdiction."" The first thing that regional leaders should do, Santos said later at the summit's opening session, is seriously and collaboratively examine how to tackle drug trafficking ""without dogma, without prejudice."" ""This summit is not going to resolve this issue,"" he said. ""But it can be a starting point to begin a discussion that we have been postponing for far too long."" Obama earlier Saturday left the door open for debate, but made it clear that the United States has a firm stance. ""I think it is entirely legitimate to have a conversation about whether the laws in place are doing more harm than good in certain places,"" Obama said. ""I personally, and my administration's position is, that legalization is not the answer."" Much attention in the run-up to the summit was on the drug issue, as well as on leaders from the hemisphere who are not present in the coastal city of Cartagena, Colombia. Venezuela's foreign minister told reporters Saturday that Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez will not attend because of health reasons. Chavez had recently returned to his country from Cuba, where he underwent cancer treatment. Cuba, which is not a member of the Organization of American States, was not invited to join the leaders. But there was a last-minute push by Ecuador's leftist President Rafael Correa to get Cuban leader Raul Castro a seat at the table. Correa boycotted the summit because of Cuba's exclusion. Santos, a key U.S. ally, said in his opening remarks Saturday that it was time to overcome such issues -- calling it unthinkable if Cuba is not part of the next Summit of the Americas, as well as nearby Haiti. The United States has ""never been more excited"" to work as equal partners with countries in Latin America, Obama said earlier Saturday -- a vow that's been made before by U.S. presidents, but that nonetheless drew applause from the audience of business leaders. The president presented an upbeat assessment of hemispheric relations, touting a 46% increase in trade between the United States and Latin American and Caribbean countries. ""This hemisphere is very well positioned in the global economy,"" he said. Rousseff spoke of a need for a ""virtuous relationship"" based on respect and equality among economies, while Santos said he welcomed a ""change of mentality in relations between north and south."" Obama pointed out one change he'd like to see: ""I think in Latin America, part of the change in mentality, is also not always looking at the United States as the reason for everything ... that goes wrong."" There are many examples of increased cooperation between the United States and Latin America, but they are not always flashy and don't draw the same type of attention that conflicts do, Obama said. ""Oftentimes in the press, the attention at summits like this ends up focusing on the controversies,"" the president added. ""Sometimes those controversies date back to before I was born."" The summit's start was momentarily overshadowed by two security incidents -- one involving bomb blasts and another involving Secret Service in Colombia to protect the U.S. delegation. Roughly a dozen Secret Service agents and officers are being investigated over early findings that they allegedly brought back several prostitutes to a hotel in Cartagena, two U.S. government sources familiar the investigation told CNN. The Secret Service personnel have since been sent back to the United States. Separately, two small blasts occurred nearly back-to-back Friday in Cartagena. The explosions -- one near a bus station and another near a shopping mall -- occurred a good distance away from where world leaders were gathering, said Alberto Cantihho Toncell, a spokesman for the Colombia National Police. There were no casualties, and only minor damage was reported, Toncell said. The explosions came on the heels of a similar one earlier in the day near the U.S. Embassy in the capital city of Bogota, authorities said. CNN's Dan Lothian contributed to this report.","NEW: Colombia's president says it is unthinkable if Cuba isn't at the next summit .

"(CNN) -- A month ago, Elana Meyers was hurtling down the Sochi bobsleigh track at 150 kph on her way to winning an Olympic silver medal. Now the 29-year-old has swapped the ice for a rugby ball as she sets out on her quest to be a Summer Olympian with the United States sevens team at the Rio Games in 2016. It's an ambitious bid -- Meyers had never played the game until two weeks ago. ""I'm offside all the time,"" she says frankly. ""I'm running ahead of the ball all the time. ""The other problem is that with the bobsleigh, I was used to just running in a straight line. That seems to be my default setting, and it doesn't work like that in rugby sevens. It's a sharp learning curve."" Meyers could have been forgiven for taking more time off after the Olympics. With a bronze from Vancouver four years ago, she had gone to Sochi seeking gold with new partner Lauryn Williams -- a track star who tasted success at London 2012 in the 4 x 100 meters relay and won 400m silver in 2004. In the end, they came agonizingly close to victory, edged out by just one-tenth of a second after four runs on the Olympic course by Canadian duo Kaillie Humphries and Heather Moyse. It left Meyers with her demons. In the following days, she wrote on her blog: ""Every night, I'm haunted by that last run. I haven't slept much since it happened. I replay the skids so vividly in my head that any thoughts of the other corners are reduced to a mere hazy memory. ""So how does it feel to feel like you choked in front of the whole world? How does it feel to have your lifelong dream slip away literally from your fingertips? It sucks. Was I too exhausted? Did I just finally hit my mental limits? I don't know."" The inquest into every painstaking moment of that final run -- the American duo's slowest by half a second -- has dissipated in recent weeks, but Meyers concedes ""you still can't help going through what happened, what you might have done differently."" She has allowed herself to increasingly dwell on the silver lining of Sochi more often than asking ""what if?"" Thankfully, there has been barely been a chance to stop and think -- there were welcome-home celebrations in Georgia before she set out on her sevens mission, and Meyers also has a wedding to plan. Prior to traveling to Russia, U.S. Eagles coach Ric Suggitt invited Meyers to the US Olympic Training Center (OTC) in California to test herself at rugby. ""A couple of girls on the bobsleigh team had previously played rugby and made the switch,"" she says. ""So I thought why can't I do it the other way around? ""The coach asked me if I was interested in coming to practice and then come out after the Olympics for a trial. I'd never tried it out before so I thought, 'Why not?' ""Even though I haven't played the game before, I think they looked at me and thought I was the right build. I'm a big girl -- I'm 175 lbs and 5 foot 8 inches -- so I knew I wasn't worried about doing the hitting or getting hit. ""I think I was just worried about not knowing the rules. It's been a case of out of the frying pan and into the fire, but it's been a blast."" The switch of sports is nothing new for her. Her first sporting foray of note had been in softball and there were hopes of being selected for the U.S. team for the 2008 Olympics. She missed out, and the sport was duly scrapped from the Olympic schedule. By then, her focus had already switched to the bobsleigh, an event she first tried out in 2007. It has brought her two Olympic medals and two world titles, as well as a fiance -- fellow American bobsledder Nic Taylor. The pair had been dating for two years when Taylor took the decision to pop the question at the 2013 world championships in St. Moritz, with Meyers standing on the podium. Taylor had roses in his hand when he was handed the microphone by organizers, and he dropped to one knee. At the time, Meyers admitted: ""It was such a shock. It was amazing."" As if mastering a new sport wasn't enough, Meyers is now planning a wedding for April 24. ""It's been crazy but it's mostly planned. Obviously the focus was on Sochi so we were a little bit late out with the invitations but we're steadily getting the RSVPs in,"" she says. ""I'm getting married at my parents' house. It's already been a great 2014 whatever happens with the rugby, and I'm pretty excited about the big day."" The pressure is on Meyers to play a remarkable game of catchup with her fellow American rugby players as she attempts to marry her strengths to the requirements of the code -- a shortened version of the 15-a-side union format. But as an athlete nicknamed ""E-Money"" -- from her ability to deliver when it counts in the pressure situations -- she is confident she will get to grips with it. ""If it goes well, it would be awesome to be part of the team in Rio,"" she says. ""Rio was the thing that got me interested and that's the very obvious goal. ""But that's some way off. My legs were burning so much from that first week. It's not that I'm not fit but this is such a different level of fitness, there's so much cardio. ""But I'm optimistic that I'll get better ... a lot better. To get to Rio would just be super crazy."" In her sporting switch, she has had a useful ally in Williams. ""Lauryn talked about how special the Summer Games was, how huge it was,"" says Meyers. ""She talked a lot about the pressure of being on the start line for the 100m final. ""I've basically been asking her for as much information as possible. She's given me some good advice."" Meyers has oval-ball history -- her father used to play in the NFL for the Atlanta Falcons, though his career was coming to an end when she was young. ""If I'm honest, the thing I remember the most was the team mascot, Freddie the Falcon,"" she says laughing. ""I really remember there was a McDonald's nearby and I remember eating a cheeseburger in the playground when the Falcon appeared. I'm not sure my Dad appreciates that being my favorite memory of him playing."" Despite her new sporting flirtation, Meyers is not divorcing herself from the ice track just yet. ""As we get closer to Rio, I realize I may need to change my approach and focus more solely, on sevens, but I don't want to give up the bobsleigh at the moment. I love it too much.""","A few weeks ago, Elana Meyers was going for gold in Sochi, now she's playing rugby sevens .

"(CNN)  -- Text messaging is one of the popular ways to communicate these days. However, unlike most wireless carriers in the rest of the world, U.S. wireless companies tend to double-charge customers for texts: They charge both for sending texts and for delivering each text message. This can be annoying, especially for the vast majority of people who don't have smartphones. If you're looking to save money on texting, or if you just think those double charges are silly, there are some ways to avoid them -- at least the charge for sending a text message. While plans that include unlimited texting are popular, many budget-conscious cell phone users have plans with text-message limits -- and they face extra charges if they exceed those limits. Also, many phones (especially pre-paid ones) charge per message, and the cost for this can be steep. For instance, a T-Mobile prepaid plan charges ""10 cents to send a text and 5 cents to receive in the U.S. and Canada; 35 cents to send and 5 cents to receive everywhere else."" Not only can you send a text message via e-mail from your computer, but also from any e-mail-enabled phone. Most phones, even inexpensive feature phones, can send and receive e-mail messages. Also, wireless carriers designate an e-mail address for any e-mail enabled phone -- so you don't need to worry about linking your computer-based e-mail to your phone service if you don't want to. Sometimes, wireless carriers tack on fees to enable e-mail on your phone, so ask your carrier about this and make sure you know how to send and receive regular e-mails on your phone first. To send a text message by e-mail you need to know which wireless carrier the recipient of your message uses. So ask the people your regularly send text messages to which carrier they use. Then, look up how you would reformat each of their phone number/carrier pairs as an e-mail address. Each wireless carrier has an e-mail-to-SMS gateway, with a special format to accept incoming e-mail messages and route them as text messages to cell phones. Here are the formats for the four major U.S. carriers. In each of these, for ""N"" substitute the recipient's 10-digit phone number (include the area code -- but don't include hyphens or other space separating characters): . AT&T Wireless: N@txt.att.net  SprintPCS: N@messaging.sprintpcs.com  T-Mobile: N@tmomail.net  Verizon: N@vtext.com   MuTube has a more complete list of e-mail-to-SMS address formats, for carriers in North America and around the world. Next, add entries to your e-mail address book (on your phone and on your computer or web-based e-mail service) for each person to whom you regularly send text messages, once you find out which carrier they're on. Keep your messages brief. Text-message-length limits still apply, even though you're originating the message from e-mail. Carriers have different length limits for text messages, but Twitter's limit of 140 characters plays nice with most North American wireless carriers' texting limits. If your message exceeds the allowed number of characters, the delivered text message may get truncated or split into multiple messages (perhaps resulting in multiple charges). Your recipients probably would not be pleased by this. Write your entire text message in the subject line of your e-mail. Leave the message body blank -- and be sure to remove any automated signature text your e-mail program might supply. Most e-mail-to-SMS gateways will transmit both the e-mail subject line and message body within the delivered text message. However, since you want to keep your message very short anyway, it's easier to just get in the habit of typing your text message in the subject line and deleting everything from the message body. Before you send someone a text by e-mail, let them know you're going to try doing this, so they'll expect your message. Remember: The first time they receive a text that you send via e-mail, it won't be coming from your regular phone number. They may not recognize that it's from you, and might mistake your message for spam or an error and delete it without reading it. Also note that when you send a text message via e-mail, if the recipient hits ""reply,"" their reply message usually will get routed back to the e-mail account from which you sent it. It's smart to test this out, too. Finally, remind your recipients to notify you if they switch to a different wireless carrier. People can port their phone number from one carrier to another -- but when they change carriers, the format for their e-mail-to-text address will change, so you'll want to update that information in your address book. Getting set up to send text messages by e-mail involves a little bit of up-front work. And there are other drawbacks. Straightforward e-mail-to-e-mail messages don't always provide mobile push notifications, such as alert sounds, especially on feature phones. But the effort can be worth it if you text certain people frequently. It's useful if you want to be sure they get instant notification of your message wherever they are. This strategy is especially useful to send text messages to groups -- such as parents of the kids in a hockey team, or a carpool group, or everyone in your immediate family. You could even use this strategy to publish text alerts to large audiences (such as a political candidate's supporters, or people who sign up to get local news alerts by text). It's generally simpler to designate groups of e-mail addresses than groups of SMS recipients on your phone. Also, it's fairly private -- when you use e-mail to send text messages to a group, each recipient sees only your contact information, not the contact information for the other recipients. If you must contact large groups of people via SMS, avoiding carrier charges for sending text messages can significantly improve the economics of group communication. And it's simpler and more reliable to send your group text alerts directly than to count on a third-party service like Twitter Fast Follow. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Amy Gahran.","U.S. wireless carriers tend to double-charge customers for texts .

"(CNN) -- His name means ""bright light"" in Japanese, and at the tender age of 18 he's already shining on the global rugby stage. Less than one year out of high school, Akira Ioane made an impressive debut at the HSBC Wellington Sevens last month as his native New Zealand romped to tournament victory. The Auckland teenager's pace, power and try-scoring exploits have even drawn comparisons to All Blacks rugby legend Jonah Lomu, the rampaging winger who first appeared at the 1994 Hong Kong Sevens before going on to star at the World Cup in South Africa one year later. But the softly spoken teenager -- who at 6 foot 4 inches and 227 pounds (103 kg) is not quite as hulking as the giant Lomu -- is eager to offer a Maori sidestep to what he sees as early career hyperbole after appearing at just two events on the international sevens circuit so far. ""Jonah has done great things for New Zealand and the All Blacks sevens and I don't really like being compared to him,"" Ione told CNN's Rugby Sevens Worldwide show. ""(Lomu) sort of took the world by storm. I'm just a normal 18-year-old boy making his way, nowhere near what he was when he was this age."" Despite the glowing reviews his early performances have garnered, Ioane feels he is still adjusting to life as a professional athlete. He was turning out as a back-row forward for New Zealand's school select XV as recently as last year before proving his worth for the Auckland side at the New Zealand National Sevens and World Club Sevens. New Zealand sevens coach Gordon Tietjens recently described Ioane as someone with ""all the attributes and skill set of a fine rugby player,"" albeit on a sharp learning curve. Accordingly, the transition from the 15-a-side game he excelled at in high school to the slicker, faster international sevens code has not been easy going -- not least nutritionally, with fast food now off the menu for Ioane thanks to Tietjens' strict regime. ""It's been hard coming from a 15s background, where you don't have to be as fit as you are in sevens. 'Tietj' has made me work hard,"" Ioane said. ""Back in high school I used to have pies every day, McDonald's whenever we were out, but now with the sevens it's a lot different. 'Tietj' is always watching what we eat, getting the right food into us so we can perform on training days and on game day."" This new focus on diet and conditioning seems to be paying early dividends. Ioane's strong debut showing in Wellington was followed up with another solid performance at the Tokyo Sevens this past weekend (where New Zealand finished fourth behind England, South Africa and tournament winners Fiji) and he has been selected for this weekend's prestigious Hong Kong Sevens. Turning out in the Japanese capital, however, was a special moment for Ioane, who spent much of his early childhood in the city. His father Eddie was a professional rugby player there for six years in the late 1990s and Ioane revealed that's where his first name comes from. ""With dad playing in Japan, I sort of guess it felt right for him to give me and my brother Japanese names. My name means 'bright light,' I think, and my brother's name is Ricoh (after the club his father played for in Tokyo). So, two Japanese names and I guess it's special,"" he said. Ioane's father also played internationally for Western Samoa at the 1991 Rugby World Cup, reaching the semifinal stage after a famous victory over Wales. His mother, meanwhile, represented New Zealand's international women's team. This rich rugby heritage ensures that the young Akira has plenty of confidantes to turn to for advice if required -- but it hasn't stopped his parents from insisting he also prepares for a career outside the game as a fallback. ""They're proud but they also want me to have an education outside of rugby, balancing sport and study and just making sure that I don't fall behind in classes and things like that,"" said Ioane. ""You're only one injury away from career over and then what do you have to fall back on? So yeah, they're just making sure I have that and getting my priorities right as well as doing well in sevens."" With the Hong Kong event approaching this weekend, Ioane's focus is solely on rugby for the time being. He hopes to build on what he has achieved so far and cement his place in Tietjens' plans for the remainder of the sevens season. ""I've enjoyed it, even though it's hard and I've struggled sometimes, it's what you have to do to be a professional rugby player,"" he said. ""If you've been picked for the team it shows that you obviously have potential."" See also: Land of the rising scrum . See also: Sevens vs. the NFL .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- The worst flooding in generations crept deeper into Bangkok Friday as the Thai leader asked residents to come to terms with water everywhere. Cars looked like boats driving on roads turned to rivers. People propped their feet up on coffee tables not for rest but just to keep dry as murky water entered homes. The flooding has claimed 442 lives, the Interior Ministry said. Of Thailand's 64 provinces, 25 have been affected. Bangkok's central business district is still dry but other parts of the bustling metropolis of 12 million people are inundated. Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra told western Bangkok residents that the water was sure to linger and they must learn to cope, the MCOT news agency reported. She said the real problem was western Bangkok, which has no infrastructure to handle the massive volumes of runoff from provinces farther north soaked by this year's heavy monsoons. The flooding has had an enormous business impact as many factories and offices have been under water for more than a month. That includes Hi Tech Industrial Park, where Canon and Sony own assembly plants. Thanakit Photong, the site's safety manager, said he expected to begin pumping water out next week. Srisuda Khunnatham, an employee at the tech park, said she was frightened when she first saw the flooding. ""At first I was afraid that I might be laid off, but my company reassured us,"" she said. ""I didn't expect it would be that bad."" CNN's Kocha Olarn contributed to this report.","Interior Ministry says 442 people have died .

"(CNN) -- Like a magician in a blue shirt and white socks, James Riddle Hoffa stood outside the Machus Red Fox restaurant in Michigan on July 30, 1975, made a phone call, and vanished. Some people would later say he seemed nervous as he headed to a supposed meeting there with suspected mob bosses. Some would say they saw a mysterious car leaving the lot. But the one question no one has yet answered for investigators is the essential one: Where did he go? Now, once again, as they have so many times before, FBI agents and other officers are digging. Once again, the lead has come from someone with ties to organized crime. And once again, the target is a nondescript field where Hoffa might...just might...be buried. All that changes is the details. Hoffa still fascinates after 40 years . This time the story being told involves Hoffa being beaten with a shovel, and buried alive beneath the concrete slab of a now long-gone barn. Oakland County Sheriff Mike Burchard says, ""It is my fondest hope that we can give that closure not only to the Hoffa family but also to the community to stop tearing that scab off with every new lead and bring some conclusion."" Hoffa's life came to its mysterious conclusion after decades of truly remarkable accomplishments. Born in Indiana, he became interested in organized labor as a teenager when he encountered unfair working conditions. As he grew into adulthood, he became more assertive about organizing unions, and gradually he became the leader of the Teamsters, transforming that union into a political juggernaut capable of making or breaking candidates. It was his passion. On a grainy old piece of film from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in 1960 you can still see him in his office near the Capitol in Washington. He bristles when the reporter asks if he has any hobbies, like golfing. ""Seven days a week,"" Hoffa says, ""I have more fun here working than anybody can have on a golf course or any sport you can name."" Hoffa's bare-knuckled, win-at-all-costs approach to the union business, however, took him down some dark roads. He struck deals with organized crime leaders. He broke laws. And eventually he was sent to prison. In what looked like a sketchy -- if unproven -- deal for political support, President Richard Nixon pardoned him, and the Teamsters lined up behind Nixon's successful reelection campaign. But even Nixon's help came with a price: Hoffa was told he had to stay out of the union business. Still, Hoffa fought to regain his power anyway, and soon a lot of people in a lot of places arguably had reasons to want him gone. Then he was. And ever since, people have looked for him. More than a dozen times investigators have followed what are invariably described as ""credible"" leads to a suspected Hoffa burial site. Michigan has produced the most locations, and Hoffafiles often refer to them by their distinguishing features, making conversation sound like a list of a Richard Stark novels: The Horse Farm Grave. The Dead Man's Dumpster. New Jersey, with its long history of Wise Guys (cue the ""Sopranos"" theme) has also excited attention in the hunt for Hoffa. One of the most popular theories is that he was encased in the cement of Giants Stadium. And on and on the theories go. He was sunk in the swamps of Florida. He was carted off to California. He was crushed in a car and shipped overseas with a load of scrap metal. Sometimes the possibilities seem as endless as the searches. All of this is not cheap. Based on the sticker price of just one search as analyzed by the Detroit News, it is not unreasonable to estimate that police agencies have spent well over $3 million trying to find this man. Or more to the point: his body. He was legally declared dead in 1982, and even if he had been miraculously living incognito in Toledo all these years, he would be 100 years old. Strangely, there seems little debate about what most likely happened. True crime aficionados and authorities alike have long believed that Hoffa's dreams of a comeback did not sit so well with mobsters who'd settled into a new routine while Hoffa was away. And, they theorize, because he would not go into a quiet retirement, the ""muscle"" showed up and retired him another way. The details are the problem. Precisely who did it? Precisely how? Police know you can't make much of a criminal case based on, ""We're pretty sure he's dead, and we're pretty sure it was these guys."" Hoffa's family has responded to the latest tip and search as they always do, by suggesting they hope it works. But 38 years after the man who was the ruling face of big labor disappeared in the clear light of day, no one has yet been able to throw aside the curtain, untangle the riddle, and declare ""We have found him."" For now, James Riddle Hoffa, is still hiding.","Since Jimmy Hoffa disappeared on July 30, 1975, the mystery has lingered .

"(CNN) -- The Miami Marlins are not playing in this year's World Series. So why was a guy sitting behind home plate at Kauffman Stadium, home of the Kansas City Royals, in a bright orange Miami Marlins jersey at Games 1 and 2? That mystery man is Laurence Leavy. He is the Marlins Man. And he loves watching sports in person and up close. Leavy, 58, is a compensation lawyer who lives in Miami. He isn't married and doesn't have any children, giving him extra disposable income to attend high-profile sporting events in high-profile seats. He told CNN he's been to 27 Super Bowls, and he recently told The Miami Herald that he has been to more than 200 NBA playoff games and at least 85 World Series games. The event that triggered Leavy to start attending so many games was a breakup. He says he was in a relationship with a woman who didn't like sporting events. ""So when I stopped seeing her, I decided I'm going to start going to stuff I'm watching on TV. That was about 15 years ago, and I've been doing it ever since."" He is a Marlins season ticket holder, with two seats -- you guessed it -- behind home plate at Marlins Park. He also has four tickets in the first row by first base. He says gives those away to his employees or strangers before games. If you've been watching the World Series, you couldn't help but see Leavy among the sea of blue in Kauffman Stadium in Kansas City. His presence in orange caused buzz online and on social media. ""Nobody ever noticed me when I used to wear like a Yankees hat or a Cowboys jersey or anything like that, and I used to wear Marlins teal,"" Leavy said. ""But in 2012, when I went to the World Series for the Giants game, people noticed me wearing an orange Marlins jersey behind the Giants bench, and that's kind of how the whole thing started with people knowing who I am and what I did."" But it's different this time. More people have noticed him. His recent fame has caused a spike in his followers on Twitter. His handle, @Marlins_Man, has jumped from roughly 175 followers to more than 6,700 in the last three days. On Thursday, Leavy said he knew he was in for a ride when he saw himself on the front page of Wednesday's USA Today. So why is he getting noticed by so many now? Leavy said he thinks things got big because of the color contrast with the Royals blue. Wearing an orange Marlins jersey that looks like it could glow in the dark didn't go over well in Kansas City. Leavy said the Royals asked him to move or change clothes, and he refused. The Royals didn't immediately respond to CNN's request for comment, though the club has denied this happened, according to other reports. ""It's a wonderful experience, and I've decided I want to keep doing this, so I am going to keep doing it,"" Leavy said. ""I've been asked a lot recently, 'Are you going to keep doing this?' And I said, 'Why not?' So I'm doing this."" Leavy will be in San Francisco for Game 3 on Friday, although he may not be as easy to spot among the Giants' faithful wearing orange. But keep an eye out for him. He'll be in the second row, on the aisle, behind the catcher. CNN's Joe McCurdy contributed to this report.","Laurence Leavy likes to attend high-profile sporting events in high-profile seats .

"(CNN) -- ""Style -- all who have it share one thing: originality."" With her heavily rouged cheeks, hawk nose, fondness for costume jewelry and quotable musings delivered with a smoker's rasp, Diana Vreeland is certainly regarded as an original. Under her editorial watch, some of the most iconic images of our times were published: The first picture of the Kennedys as a presidential couple in Harper's Bazaar, Barbra Streisand's pronounced profile on the cover of Vogue and 19-year-old up-and-comer Mick Jagger on the pages inside. Lisa Immordino Vreeland is the director of the new documentary ""Diana Vreeland: The Eye Has to Travel,"" an intimate reflection and celebration of Diana Vreeland's remarkable life and clout in the fashion scene. The film goes into limited U.S. release today. In 1936, Vreeland was hired as the fashion editor for Harper's Bazaar -- a position she would hold for 25 years before being named the editor-in-chief at Vogue. At 70, after being fired from Vogue rather brusquely and disdainful of the idea of retirement, she became a special consultant to The Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art until she died in 1989. Lisa Immordino Vreeland is married to Alexander Vreeland, Diana's grandson, but never got to meet Diana before she died. Immordino Vreeland spoke to CNN about the renowned tastemaker, her fabled life and how we could all dare to look at the world with a more astute eye. CNN: What made Vreeland's concept of beauty so revolutionary? Lisa Immordino Vreeland: I think that Diana Vreeland's definition of beauty was so open because she was such an open person. I think she understood what low and high culture was, and I think that's one of the most important outlooks that she had because beauty doesn't have to be just physical. Beauty has to be deep down, it has to be soulful. It's not about the dress you wear, it's about the life you lead in the dress. I feel that is very important for what life is about. Beauty transcends fashion, and in a sense, she transcended fashion. For her, it was an awareness of people, of people's personalities, and that was one of the most important aspects that she had. CNN: In the case of '60s icons such as Penelope Tree, Twiggy and Mick Jagger, she was known for seeing things in them before they saw it in themselves. She also wasn't afraid of pushing people's ""faults."" Why was this so significant? Immordino Vreeland: I think it's about being your true self. Whatever was real was what she was ultimately striving for. She was always looking at the layer underneath everything, even if that layer contained faults. For her, it was about the depth of a person that counted. She, of course, understood what real beauty was. For her, somebody like Penelope Tree, who was brought up in a good family in New York, she saw a girl under there that was totally different. She was not the normal beauty. She really represented the '60s, which was original thought. CNN: She once said of style, ""It helps you get down the stairs. It helps you get up in the morning. It's a way of life. Without it, you're nobody. I'm not talking about lots of clothes."" What can people learn from Vreeland about this concept of personal style? Immordino Vreeland: I think you're going to have to go with yourself -- especially today when you travel throughout the world and you find all the same stores everywhere. When Diana was around, it was about when you go to Milan, you can get certain things. It was about having your own sense of identity and, for her, that's what counts. It's about how you're living your life in that dress. It's about the decisions that you're making. If you're comfortable with this, then everybody else should be comfortable with this. Don't forget, she was not this remarkable beauty -- and that was one of her driving forces. She grew up with a mother who was very difficult -- she not only called her ""her ugly little monster"" but then continued to challenge her. In fact, when she was married to Reed (Vreeland), and he was just unbelievably handsome, the same day in the gossip columns in New York, it was announced that her mother was having a huge affair. So, all the attention was taken away from Diana Vreeland on her wedding day and put on her mother. She understood you have to trust yourself, believe in yourself and that, for me, is fundamentally what her message is. CNN: On ""The Dick Cavett Show"" in the late '70s, Vreeland said, ""Fashion is part of the daily air and it changes all the time, with all the events. You can even see the approaching of a revolution in clothes. You can see and feel everything in clothes."" What do you think she meant by that? Immordino Vreeland: It's interesting because shoes and clothes are like this. You can see what's going on in history through all of these things. It shows and marks what's going on socially, culturally and politically during that time and in the end, when she was doing these shows at the Metropolitan Museum's Costume Institute, she was educating us on those periods of history. If you look at the '60s, it's clear it's the '60s. If you look at Balenciaga, you know that it's the '40s and the '50s. She's making us aware that clothes show us so much more of history. CNN: Why do you think her legacy has remained relevant? Immordino Vreeland: This is a message of life. This is the oracle side of her. She is talking about life, about passion, about being driven. We shouldn't be driven by ambition, but for a discovery of the world. I think that the title of the film, ""The Eye Has to Travel,"" it's about the mind traveling, it's about having imagination, it's about fantasy. And this is not anything that has to do with fashion; she transcends fashion. This is about life. I think we could stand to be inspired. I think we're living in such a moment of lack of inspiration; I think it's crazy. It's not only because we're all stuck behind computers all day, including myself. We're not looking, we're not observing, there's so much more to life. She used fashion to give a message.","Diana Vreeland was a fashion editor for Harper's Bazaar and editor-in-chief of Vogue.

"(CNN) -- For the first time, a health care worker for a World Health Organization partner organization has fallen ill from Ebola, WHO told CNN on Sunday. The health worker, a man from Senegal, is in Sierra Leone and receiving care, the WHO said. He's an epidemiologist working for the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, which was established by WHO and other partners to respond to international public health emergencies. No further details were given immediately. ""This is the first time someone working under the aegis of WHO has fallen ill with #Ebola,"" reported WHO via its verified Twitter account. Added WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl via Twitter: ""No @WHO worker has been infected with #Ebola. The epidemiologist is from a #GOARN partner."" When asked how the worker contracted the virus, a WHO spokesperson said officials don't yet know all the details. Separately, a British citizen infected with the virus in Sierra Leone is being flown home, the British Department of Health announced Sunday. The man, identified simply as William, lives in the West African nation in a home established by an American university for researchers. He is a volunteer nurse in Kenema Government Hospital, where he was working with Ebola patients, according to Dr. Robert Garry of Tulane University. Garry is manager of the university's program that researches Ebola. The hospital is run by the government of Sierra Leone, but receives support from Tulane researchers. The UK government said a specially equipped C17 Royal Air Force plane would transport the patient, who would be transferred to an isolation unit at the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust. ""UK hospitals have a proven record of dealing with imported infectious diseases and this patient will be isolated and will receive the best care possible,"" said deputy chief medical officer John Watson in a press release. Meanwhile, the Democratic Republic of the Congo reported that two of eight people from the town of Gera suffering from a hemorrhagic fever tested positive for Ebola, a government spokesperson told CNN. The government has set up a lab, mobile treatment center and quarantine area in Gera, which is 1,200 kilometers (750 miles)from Kinshasa. The strain of Ebola is different from the one in West Africa, government spokesperson Lambert Mende Omalanga said. Confirmation testing will likely be done by WHO on Monday, said WHO spokesman Hartl via Twitter. Ivory Coast announced Saturday that it's closing its borders in response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. Prime Minister Daniel Duncan signed the order that closes the land borders Ivory Coast shares with Guinea and Liberia. The borders will remain closed until further notice in an effort to prevent the Ebola virus from spreading into its territory, according to the government statement. Ebola is one of the world's most virulent diseases, according to the WHO. The virus is introduced to human populations through the human handling of infected animals -- like fruit bats, gorillas and monkeys, to name a few -- found sick or dying in the rainforest. The infection is then transmitted among humans through direct contact with the blood or other bodily fluids of infected people. WHO's maps of confirmed cases show the Ebola outbreak is limited to four West African nations -- Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Nigeria. So far, nearly 2,500 suspected cases have been reported in what the WHO says is the worst known outbreak of the disease. However, the WHO's website says the survival rate for people with Ebola in this outbreak has been 47%, which is a substantial improvement over the disease's survival rate, historically. CNN's Katia Hetter, Aliza Kassim and Carma Hassan contributed to this report.","NEW: He's the first worker from a WHO partner to fall ill from Ebola .

"(CNN) -- ""Ouija"" is at the head of the class in more ways than one. The fright flick not only debuted at No. 1 on the weekend before Halloween, it also became the first movie based on a board game to top the weekend box office. Admittedly, that's not a huge category: The only other real examples are 2012's ""Battleship,"" which was swamped by the ""Avengers"" tsunami, and 1985's ""Clue."" (The games ""Jumanji"" and ""Zathura"" were both based on the books/movies, not the other way around.) After a stretch in which critical acclaim and box office success went hand in hand -- think ""Fury,"" ""Gone Girl"" and ""The Equalizer"" -- this weekend brought a reminder that audiences often ignore movie reviews. Critics hated ""Ouija,"" giving it a rancid 10% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. But late October proved to be a perfect time for a horror film about teens using the spirit board to contact a dear departed friend and summoning something much darker instead. ""Ouija"" had no problem defeating the weekend's other new wide release, ""John Wick."" The Keanu Reeves action flick received much better reviews but didn't appeal to as wide an audience. Reeves plays a retired hitman (aren't they all?) who ventures back into the underworld to set things right. Among returning films, ""Gone Girl"" is slipping the least from weekend to weekend. The highly praised drama starring Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike is up to $124 million, and in a period of rapid box office turnover, it's the oldest film in the top 10: four whole weekends in release. The biggest leap up the chart belonged to ""St. Vincent,"" starring Bill Murray. Success in limited release doesn't always continue when a movie opens wider, but that's what happened here: After two weekends in a handful of theaters, the indie comedy co-starring Melissa McCarthy and Naomi Watts expanded nationwide and pulled in $8.1 million, nearly cracking the top five. Domestic weekend box office estimates from Exhibitor Relations Co. (final numbers available Monday afternoon): . 1. ""Ouija"" -- $20 million . 2. ""John Wick"" -- $14.2 million . 3. ""Fury"" -- $13 million ($46.1 million total) 4. ""Gone Girl"" -- $11 million ($124.1 million total) 5. ""The Book of Life"" -- $9.8 million ($29.9 million total)","""Ouija"" debuted at No. 1 .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- A woman whose group has rescued more than 12,000 women and girls from sex slavery has been named the 2010 CNN Hero of the Year. Anuradha Koirala was chosen by the public in an online poll that ran for eight weeks on CNN.com. CNN's Anderson Cooper revealed the result at the conclusion of the fourth annual ""CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute."" ""Human trafficking is a crime, a heinous crime, a shame to humanity,"" Koirala said earlier in the evening after being introduced as one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2010. ""I ask everyone to join me to create a society free of trafficking. We need to do this for all our daughters."" Koirala was introduced by actress Demi Moore, who along with her husband, Ashton Kutcher, created DNA, The Demi and Ashton Foundation, which aims to eliminate child sex slavery worldwide. ""Every day this woman confronts the worst of what humanity has to offer,"" Moore said of Koirala. ""She says, 'Stop. Stop selling our girls.' By raiding brothels and patrolling the India-Nepal border, she saves girls from being sold into the sex trade, where they are being repeatedly raped for profit, tortured and enslaved. ""Since 1993, she has helped rescue more than 12,000 women and girls. Through her organization Maiti Nepal, she has provided more than a shelter for these girls and young women, she has created a home. It is a place for them to heal, go to school, learn a skill, and for some who are infected with HIV/AIDS, it is the place where they can spend their days surrounded by love."" See Koirala's fan page on CNN Heroes . Koirala will receive $100,000 to continue her work with Maiti Nepal, in addition to the $25,000 awarded to each of the top 10 Heroes honored. ""This is another responsibility to me to work with all your support,"" Koirala told the audience after being named Hero of the Year. ""We have to end this heinous crime. Please join hands with me to end this crime. ... Please try to respect the youth. They are the ones who are going to build the next generation. Thank you so much."" Koirala's speech capped the gala event, which was taped November 20 before an audience of nearly 5,000 and premiered Thanksgiving night on the global networks of CNN. The show opened with a salute to the 33 Chilean miners and five of the people who rescued them last month after the miners spent 69 days underground. ""For 69 days we were amazed by these 33 brave miners,"" Cooper said in welcoming the miners onto the Shrine stage. ""Their ordeal was unthinkable; their rescue, unbelievable. No one has ever been trapped underground so deep for so long and survived. ""They endured a nightmare, experienced a miracle, and in the end became each others' brothers and heroes. On behalf of CNN Heroes, we salute all 33 Chilean miners."" After the miners sang the Chilean national anthem, two of them -- speaking through a translator and holding the Chilean flag -- expressed their appreciation. ""We want to thank the world, and we want to thank God for your prayers,"" Luis Urzua told the audience in Spanish. ""Our families suffered. Our children suffered, too. But thanks to the prayers of the whole world, we could come out of this difficulty,"" Mario Sepulveda added. ""Some of our rescuers are here with us tonight,"" Urzua said. ""Thank you for bringing us home. You are our heroes."" CNN brought the miners and their rescuers to the United States to attend the tribute show. The five rescuers were selected to represent the many thousands whose talent and effort led to the dramatic rescue. The top 10 CNN Heroes, chosen by a blue-ribbon panel from an initial pool of more than 10,000 nominations from more than 100 countries, were each honored with a documentary tribute and introduced by a celebrity presenter. The program also featured performances by Grammy Award-winners Bon Jovi, John Legend and Sugarland. Rock legends Bon Jovi performed ""What Do You Got?,"" a new song from their greatest hits album, which came out earlier this month. Legend performed ""Wake Up Everybody"" along with hip-hop artist Common and R&B singer Melanie Fiona. Sugarland performed ""Stand Up,"" a new song from their album ""The Incredible Machine,"" which made its debut in October. All three performances echoed the spirit of the CNN Heroes campaign, which salutes everyday people whose extraordinary accomplishments are making a difference in their communities and beyond. Celebrity presenters included Halle Berry, Demi Moore, Jessica Alba, Kid Rock, LL Cool J, Renee Zellweger, Gerard Butler, Kiefer Sutherland, Marisa Tomei, Aaron Eckhart and Holly Robinson Peete. ""CNN Heroes has illustrated the best of humanity through the telling of stories of selfless acts of kindness, courage and perseverance"" said Jim Walton, president of CNN Worldwide. ""We are honored to bring these Heroes the recognition they so deserve. It is a program the entire CNN family is proud of and excited to share with our viewers on Thanksgiving night."" Again this year, producer/director Joel Gallen served as executive producer of ""CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute."" Among his credits, Gallen produced telethon events supporting victims of the Haiti earthquake, the 9/11 terrorist attacks and Hurricane Katrina. He won an Emmy Award and a Peabody Award for ""America: A Tribute to Heroes."" Preceding the tribute broadcast, CNN and HLN aired a red carpet special, ""Showbiz Tonight @ CNN Heroes,"" at 7 p.m. ET/4 p.m. PT. Hosted by A.J. Hammer and Brooke Anderson, the special featured exclusive coverage of celebrity arrivals and interviews, as well as a celebrity-hosted social media suite tapping into the worldwide online passion and interest in the Heroes event.

"(CNN) -- Joel Osteen is the senior pastor for the Lakewood Church in Houston, Texas. It's America's largest congregation. His wife, Victoria Osteen, is the co-pastor there. Joel and Victoria Osteen appear on ""Larry King Live"" Tuesday night. The Osteens, known for their optimistic outlook on life, visited ""Larry King Live"" Tuesday night for a wide-ranging interview that covered President Obama, same-sex marriage, the recent outbreak of mass shootings, the state of religion in America and more. The following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity: . Larry King: Since you were last on, we have sworn in our first African-American president. What are your impressions [of Barack Obama]? Joel Osteen: Well, I think he's doing a great job. I'm impressed with his skill, his calmness, his just strength under pressure. These are tough times for him. King: And you, Victoria? Victoria Osteen: I've been really impressed. In fact, I've been impressed [with] the first lady. She stepped up, and she's done a remarkable job. King: Recent polls show 12 percent of Americans still believe Obama is a Muslim, and 35 percent say they don't know his religion, but to most of them it don't matter. Should it matter? Joel Osteen: Well, it matters to me. It matters to me that I know he loves the Lord, and I think it's important that he has convictions from his faith. So to me, it matters when I'm making my personal decisions. King: Does it matter to you, Victoria? Victoria Osteen: It does. It matters to me. ... I believe he is a Christian. King: The ""Hope for Today Bible."" This is a new Bible [from you]. How is this different from other Bibles? Joel Osteen: It's a living translation of the Bible, which is an easy version to read. And then it's got our notes besides certain passages. And it's just to help people maybe to understand the Bible a little bit easier. King: Do you think that eventually many more states are going to allow same-sex marriage? Joel Osteen: You know, I don't know where it's all going ...  I'd love to see it stay between a male and a female, not knocking anybody else. King: Supposing there were more states that had it. What would be the harm? Victoria Osteen: We really want to see marriage between a man and a woman. There [are] going to be people who get together and have relationships and have what they call their families. But I just think marriage should be sanctified by the church. It should be between a man and a woman. King: Should a gay couple be allowed to adopt? Joel Osteen: I think that, again, it's best for a male and a female. I'm not saying that gay people aren't good people. ... King: Or good parents.  Watch Larry King's interview with the Osteens » . Joel Osteen: Yeah, exactly. But again, I like to shoot for God's best, and that is a father and a mother in the home. It doesn't always happen. I know a lot of people raised by single parents. And you know what? We bless them and pray for them as well. But I think God's best is a male and female. King: In the new issue of Newsweek, the lead story by Jon Meacham is ""The Decline and Fall of Christian America."" Just off the premise of that headline, do you accept that? That Christian America is in trouble? Joel Osteen: I'm trying to think where he's coming from. ...  I see faith in America at an all-time high. King: The Newsweek article quotes our Albert Mohler Jr. And he's president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. And he said, ""The so-called Judeo-Christian consensus of the last millennium has given way to a post-modern, post-Christian, post-Western cultural crisis which threatens the heart of our very culture."" Joel Osteen: Well, he's a smart man and I respect him. You know, maybe what he's saying is true. ... America is more diverse than it was 50 years ago. And I don't know that that means we as Christians are any less. I would like to think our influence is still there. ... And I'm sure I'm an optimistic by nature. King: What do you make of these mass shootings? Joel Osteen: You know, it's really sad. People get deranged. People get confused. ... I believe there are dark forces in our world. There are evil forces that, unfortunately, we can give into. And some of it is just from depression, just that mental illness. King: Do you pray for them, Victoria? The shooters? Victoria Osteen: Oh, absolutely. You've got to pray for them. They're obviously tormented. They're deceived and not cherishing life. ... So yeah, we do pray for them. King: We've had a mass depression in this country, recession. Do you think that might be at the core of some of these things? Victoria Osteen: I think it is. When you've lost your job and you've just been beaten down and you don't see any future, it's easy to start letting those negative thoughts play. ... You don't have anything to live for. It's never going to get any better. And I think that if you don't watch it, you'll just spiral down and down and down. And that is why we feel so strongly about just giving people hope. Even at your lowest moment, you never know what God can do. He can turn any situation around. You can be just one night from getting the break you need, getting the job you want. King: How do you deal with death, having to console people [who are] dying? Joel Osteen: Well, it's difficult. But Larry, we have the hope of heaven. We believe we'll see our loved ones again. And as hard as it is, we'll just try to encourage people that death is just a separation. ... I lost my dad 10 years ago, and he was my best friend. But it's amazing the peace that God gave me. So I believe that God can give you a strength and a new beginning. King: Where do you believe he is? Joel Osteen: I believe he's in heaven. King: Which is a place. ... Joel Osteen: I believe it's a real place. ... You've had people on a lot about near death experience, and I've talked to them too, how they've had an accident and all of a sudden, they're up watching themselves. And I believe that our spirit's on the inside. My belief as a Christian is when we receive Christ as salvation that that gives us a guarantee for heaven.","Joel and Victoria Osteen pastor America's largest church, visit ""Larry King Live""

"(CNN) -- Time magazine has clearly kicked up a hornet's nest with its downright insulting cover headlined ""Rotten Apples,"" and coupled with the blurb, ""It's nearly impossible to fire a bad teacher. Some tech millionaires may have found a way to change that."" The cover is a slap in the face to every teacher who has dedicated his or her life to bettering the lives of children. Right now, we should be lifting up and championing educators. The last thing we should be doing is discouraging or dampening the enthusiasm of a new generation. Worse, the Time story gives sloppy credence to the well-funded, well-orchestrated attacks from a small cadre of wealthy business interests, many of whom have never even set foot in a classroom. These attacks on public education, educators and neighborhood schools have unfortunately become the norm. It's gone too far. Enough is enough. Due process policies such as tenure are put in place to protect good teachers from being fired without cause. They aren't there to protect ""bad"" teachers. In fact, research from economist Jesse Rothstein suggests removing tenure might worsen educational outcomes because it would eliminate one of the major attractions to the profession. And since one of the biggest challenges in public education these days is teacher retention and recruitment, abolishing tenure could be incredibly harmful. Recently, Democrats for Public Education was formed to show that Democrats remain united around a core set of principles. As a co-chair, I've seen how in just two months after officially launching, scores of elected officials, activists and party leaders in all 50 states have signed up to join our organization as supporters. They understand it's time we collectively push back against efforts to undermine our schools, our teachers and the children themselves. DPE conducted a poll with Harstad Strategic Research, a Colorado-based firm that worked on President Barack Obama's historic 2008 election and 2012 re-election. The poll shows voters support public education in resoundingly large numbers. Roughly two thirds of Americans agree with traditionally Democratic positions when it comes to education. I've seen an awful lot of polling through the years. And there isn't a profession out there that wouldn't love to have the kind of favorability numbers enjoyed by local public schools and teachers in this survey. Moreover, any campaign manager would give his or her eye teeth for their candidate to have these results and engender these warm feelings among the masses. Contrary to what some naysayers -- and magazine covers -- continue to hawk, the American people are proud of their public schools. And they're proud of their teachers, too. Overall, 82% of voters able to rate their local teachers believe them to be excellent, very good or good. So, even though we've seen lawsuits from California to New York scapegoating ""bad teachers,"" the divisive views espoused by Campbell Brown and Michelle Rhee simply aren't rooted in public opinion. When presented with four broad reasons as to why public schools aren't performing better, almost no one puts the blame on ""bad teachers."" Instead, 40% cite a lack of parental involvement/support. Another 29% name inadequate funding and resources for public schools. And 18% peg it on the effects of poverty, hardships and problems kids bring to school. Only a mere 3% uttered the words ""bad teachers"" -- including 4% of Republicans and 3% of conservatives. The truth is that voters support their teachers, who are the furthest thing from ""rotten apples."" Rock-solid majorities (61%) back additional funding for public schools, including 79% of Democrats and 57% of independents. In fact, even 45% of Republicans hold this belief. It's no surprise that voters of all stripes are fed up with GOP cuts to education across the country hurting children and neighborhood schools. In 2010, a slew of obstructionist governors swept into statehouses on the tea party wave. Over the past four years, in Wisconsin, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida, Texas, Michigan and other states, we've seen -- and felt -- drastic cuts in funding for public education. Unfortunately, this year, far too many Democrats have largely avoided this issue out of a mistaken fear that running on a pro-public education platform would be a far too risky topic for their campaigns. Turns out these Democrats are just plain wrong. They're missing a golden opportunity to highlight this important issue. The good news is that there is still time over this final week of the campaign season. Throughout the country, there are opportunities to shine a lantern on these dramatic cuts, ehether it's Gov. Tom Corbett slicing education funding by $1 billion in Pennsylvania or Gov. Scott Walker, who made the biggest cuts to education in Wisconsin's history. In Florida, Gov. Rick Scott cut education by more than $1 billion. In Michigan, Gov. Rick Snyder proposed cuts to public school funding by 4%, or about $470 per student. There is no doubt that Americans are feeling this sting in their public schools. The list goes on. In North Carolina, Sen. Kay Hagan, a Democrat, has impressively and smartly utilized education as a main issue in her campaign. She's hammered her Republican challenger for gutting education when he was the GOP ringleader in the General Assembly. In fact, Hagan used the exact term ""gutting education"" four times as a cudgel in a recent debate. And that's because she knows this is an issue that resonates with voters and is keenly felt on the ground in a tangible way. Over the years, I've worked for and alongside the American Federation of Teachers and National Education Association. That's because I am proud of our public school teachers -- including my niece who teaches down in Louisiana -- just as I am proud of our nation's education system. Those who slam public education and educators are simply out-of-touch. And the numbers bear this out. The information from this new DPE survey could and should be used as a roadmap for those who want to speak out loud and clear in support of neighborhood schools and public education. Not only for the stretch run of the 2014 campaign trail, but beyond.","Time magazine's cover story about bad teachers is demeaning to educators .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Justice Department and Seattle announced a settlement Friday over long-simmering allegations of excessive force by police officers. The agreement calls for a federal court-appointed monitor who will resolve disputes that might arise over the next several years, according to officials. The monitor will also be able to order changes in the reforms announced Friday, if necessary. ""This agreement represents a blueprint for reform,"" said Assistant Attorney General Thomas Perez, the nation's chief civil rights official, who flew to Seattle to join city officials for the announcement. A series of allegations by minority groups that police were quick to resort to force in several instances prompted the Justice Department to launch an investigation. Some of the incidents were videotaped. Most prominent of the incidents was a case in which a wood-carver and member of ""First Nations"" was shot and killed by a policeman. Totem carver John T. Williams was walking down a street with a piece of wood and small knife when he was ordered to drop the weapon. When he failed to respond immediately, he was fatally shot. That August 2010 incident prompted more than 30 organizations to demand a Justice Department investigation. Justice launched a probe that found in December 2011 that the Seattle police department had engaged in a ""pattern or practice"" of excessive force. During bumpy negotiating sessions in which officials say Seattle officeholders argued over the agreement, the Justice Department set a July 31 deadline for a settlement, saying if they did not agree the federal government would sue the city. The last-minute deal Friday avoided that outcome. The Seattle settlement comes just days after the Justice Department announced a much broader deal with the city of New Orleans to try to root out deep-seated corruption in its police department. The Justice Department Civil Rights Division still has 15 other ""pattern or practice"" investigations of police departments pending. The largest is Puerto Rico. Most of the others deal with small cities. A suit against Maricopa County, Arizona, alleging discrimination against Latino suspects is currently being challenged in a federal court.","Justice Department and Seattle announced a settlement Friday .

"(CNN) -- Yahoo has joined the browser wars with Axis, its very own tool designed to enhance its search with a clear eye toward the rapidly expanding mobile Web. Axis, the company announced late Wednesday, is a stand-alone app currently available for Apple mobile devices like the iPhone and iPad and on desktops as an add-on to established browsers like Explorer, Firefox, Chrome and Safari. Yahoo special project director Ethan Batraski wrote on the company's search blog that ""with a mobile-first focus,"" the company ""set out to completely re-think and re-design how users search and browse the Web."" The result was Axis, a visual-rich tool that aims to combine searching and browsing into one experience. On mobile devices, a query returns thumbnail images of actual Web pages instead of a list of links. People can use the touchscreen to scroll and choose a page. Early reviews have been positive for the mobile version of the tool, which addresses the rising percentage of time Web users spend accessing the Internet on phones and tablets. ""Mobile is where the action is, so it makes sense that Yahoo threw the bulk of its development love into the tablet and smartphone versions,"" wrote CNET's Rafe Needleman. ""On the iPad, Axis is simply a great browser. The integrated search feature is intuitive, and being able to move through search results without having to go back to search makes sense. After only a few minutes using it I thought, Why hasn't Google done this yet? It's that good."" A pull-down feature lets users flip back and forth between a Web page and their search results. It also features search bookmarking and integration with Pinterest. Users can also integrate Axis among multiple devices, saving a personal homepage and searches on phone, tablet and desktop computers. The tool's main page also shows ""trending"" searches at any given time. On the desktop version, Axis appears as a small search box in the bottom left corner of the browser window, allowing people to keep using whatever browser they like. The unveiling of Axis comes as Yahoo is trying to jockey for position among the big three of Web search -- Google, Microsoft's Bing and Yahoo Search. Google controls about 64% of the search market, according to March numbers from Experian Hitwise. Yahoo (which is powered by Bing) had about 16% of the market, while Bing itself accounted for another 14%. E.B. Boyd, of Fast Company, writes that the release of Axis marks a new charge in the browser wars, as all three companies work to revamp, and redefine, Web search. Boyd wrote: . ""The three leaders in this space have each realized that the conventional paradigms for search, architected over a decade ago when bandwidth was low, few people used the Web for more than research, and almost all computing was done at desktops, no longer work in an age of mobile apps, multiple devices, big data, and ever greater expectation on the part of the consumer that working online is about getting things done, not just perusing documents.""","Yahoo launches Axis, a ""search browser"" with a focus on mobile .

"(CNN) -- A Jacksonville, Arkansas, man has been charged in connection with attacks on the power grid in a rural area of the state, the U.S. Justice Department said Saturday. Jason Woodring, 37, was arrested on a federal criminal complaint charging him with destruction of an energy facility, the Justice Department said. Woodring is accused of carrying out multiple acts of sabotage, targeting high-voltage power lines and a substation over a period of months, that knocked out power to thousands, the agency said. Woodring was arrested Saturday after authorities found evidence similar to those used at one of the sabotage sites, authorities said. ""Interviews were conducted and information from these interviews was connected to previous grid attacks resulting in the arrest of Woodring,"" according to a statement released by the the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas. Woodring is expected to make his first court appearance on Tuesday. Federal authorities began investigating the reports of sabotage on August 21 after someone brought down one of multistate utility Entergy's high-voltage transmission lines in Cabot. That was followed by fire set at a control house at a substation in Keo, about 25 miles south of Cabot, on September 29, the FBI said. The FBI has said investigators suggested the perpetrator in the August attack had ""above-average"" electrical skills. In the August incident, someone attempted to use a cable to catch a moving train to bring down the tower, Entergy spokeswoman Julie Muntsell said. The perpetrator also removed bolts from the base of the 100-foot tower, contributing to its downfall, she said. In the substation fire, the suspected arsonist left behind a message: ""You should have expected U.S."" was inscribed on a control panel, the bureau reported. The FBI said removing bolts from the tower ""would have created substantial noise"" during the early-morning incident, the FBI said in a written statement. On October 5, power was knocked out to thousands of people after someone cut into, then used a tractor to pull down, two electrical poles in Cabot. The power lines were owned by First Electric Cooperative. CNN's Scott Thompson and Matt Smith contributed to this report.","Jason Woodring, 37, was arrested Saturday by federal authorities .

"(CNN) -- Facebook is facing pressure to return money it accepted to run ads promoting its page for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's presidential campaign. The social media network has pulled the ads, which directed users to the campaign page, but it has refused to say whether it will return the money it took in exchange for them. ""By accepting money for 'promoted posts,' Facebook has provided a platform for the propaganda of a regime that has been at the heart of one of the world's most brutal conflicts,"" Anna Nolan of The Syria Campaign said Monday. The group has created an online petition, multiple YouTube videos and launched website called AdsForDictators.org calling on Facebook to return the money and take down the Assad campaign page. Launched in May, the Facebook page is called ""Sawa al-Assad"" (Sawa means ""together"") and has more than 230,000 likes. It is regularly updated with photos from the Assad campaign, including pictures of Bashar al-Assad and his wife, Asma, going to a polling station to vote Tuesday. Polls for the Syrian presidential election opened against the backdrop of a bloody and protracted civil war, and al-Assad is almost guaranteed to emerge victorious in a vote that opposition groups and many Western countries say has been be rigged from the start. ""We have looked onto this thoroughly, including reviewing IP address and payment information, and we have no evidence that these ads were ordered from Syria,"" a Facebook representative said. An IP address indicates an Internet user's location, though users can easily mask real IP addresses to make it appear they're in another country. ""We comply with all relevant Syrian sanctions and we do not permit ads originating from or targeting Syria,"" the Facebook representative added. Even though it removed the ads promoting the page, Facebook says it is not considering taking down the Assad campaign page. ""You'll find a range of voices debating events in Syria on Facebook,"" according to the Facebook representative. Users don't have to pay to open an account on social media, so the social network typically allows political leaders and heads of state to maintain a presence on its platforms, regardless of their standing. Social media networks often prefer not to decide which leaders deserve and don't deserve the ability to have a presence on their sites. The campaign to reelect al-Assad has maintained an active presence on Facebook and other social media with additional accounts on Twitter, Instagram and YouTube, which are all regularly updated.","The site has taken down ads for a page promoting Bashar al-Assad's presidential campaign .

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- The frightened look on the Algerian players' faces said it all. Standing in the center of the Cairo International Stadium, the 11 players representing the Desert Foxes were subjected to a barrage of boos and screams from the 100,000-strong crowd, drowning out every single note of their national anthem. Egypt versus Algeria has always been considered one of the fiercest rivalries in world football, but this age-old dual took a new dimension when the two met in a winner-takes-all match for a place in the 2010 World Cup finals.  Egypt had to win by three clear goals to go through, or win 2-0 to force a play off. What had been billed as a crucial game between Arab and Muslim brothers ended in violence, recriminations, diplomatic intrigue and a trail of broken glass and burned-out cars from Cairo to Marseilles. Not since the so-called ""Soccer War,"" when a World Cup qualifier between Honduras and El Salvador sparked armed conflict between the two feuding Central American nations in 1969, has a football match taken on such overtly political tones. Algeria and Egypt have long been regional rivals, but the current animus stems from 1989, when Egypt faced Algeria in a winner-takes-all match for a place at Italia '90. Algeria, who had qualified for the past two finals and were considered the leading power in African football, lost 1-0 thanks to a controversial Hossam Hassan goal. ""The Algeria team was full of stars and on the pitch it was very crazy; 11 fights between every player,"" recalled Ayman Younis, a former Egyptian international who had played for the Pharaohs in that qualification campaign. ""Everybody forgot what the coaches had to say and just fought instead. It was a battle, not a football match. It was like our war against Israel in 1973."" Violence followed between fans and players alike, with the Egyptian team doctor losing an eye via a broken bottle. Former African Player of the Year Lahkdar Belloumi was convicted in his absence. Despite denying any involvement in the attack an Interpol arrest warrant was hanging over him until the matter was resolved when the two governments met before last June's first group game, which Algeria won 3-1. The move was designed to defuse tensions between the two countries but by the time tickets were due to go on sale a few days before the final group match, the hysteria was almost out of control. With the Egyptian league cancelled weeks before the match, so that the team could prepare for the decider, a media war had broken out between Algeria and Egypt to fill the vacuum. The front page of Shoot, Egypt's popular weekly football newspaper, was a case in point. It depicted a scene from the film ""300,"" a cinematic depiction of the classical battle of Thermopylaein where 300 Spartans held off an attack of over 100,000 Persian soldiers. Only this time the Egyptian players' faces were superimposed over the faces of the Spartan soldiers. At the front, leading the charge with Egyptian flag in hand, was the coach Hassan Shehata. The headline read: ""Attack,"" written in Arabic and smeared in blood. The escalation of the dirty media war was highlighted when the Algerian team landed in Cairo: Their bus was attacked by stone-throwing youths, who smashed windows and injured four people, including three players. ""They let them do it,"" defender Antar Yahia told Algerian state radio, accusing Egyptian security guards of standing back and allowing the attack to happen. ""It's shameful. In our home game we welcomed them with flowers."" But, despite a FIFA representative witnessing the attack, the Egyptian media, including the government controlled daily Al Ahram, accused the Algerians of fabricating the claim to try and force a cancellation. Across town protests broke out in front of the Algerian embassy as hundreds of Algerians tried to pick up tickets only to be told that just 2,000 would be made available. ""The Egyptians are so scared, they are trying any means [to win the match], it is a dirty game,"" explained 45-year-old Elias Filali, a British Algerian businessman as he waited for news about tickets. ""The image of Egypt is at stake."" On the day of the match the vast majority who had arrived at the Cairo International Stadium six hours before kick off to create the intimidating wall of sound that had drowned out the Algerian anthem were convinced that the Algerians were trying to cheat their way to the finals. The Desert Foxes, several wearing heavy bandages from the wounds they had received when their coach was attacked, were visibly rattled by the hostility, so much so that Amr Zaki managed to score in the second minute, giving 80 million Egyptians hope. Then Emad Moteab looped in a header five minutes into injury time. The Algerians were silent, halted just 30 seconds from the finishing line. The Egyptian bench stormed the pitch, the crowd exploding in disbelief. ""They [Algeria] are so disappointed now,"" shouted Essam Bilal, a celebrating Egypt fan, over the din of car horns from the grid locked streets outside the stadium. ""It was bulls**t that they were attacked [because] I know the bus driver and he said they invented everything so they deserved to lose."" The goal set off a chain of violent events around globe. The Egyptian government eventually confirmed that 20 Algerians had been hurt in riots outside the stadium, after initially denying anything untoward had taken place. One Algerian newspaper reported, falsely, that seven ""bodies"" had been flown back from Cairo. Riots flared in Marseille, where youths of Algerian origin set fire to boats and cars; Algiers was rocked when Egyptian businesses were ransacked by angry fans. Egypt recalled its ambassador to Algeria in protest. But the result meant that the two now had to play again, in Sudan, under tight security. Tens of thousands of Algerian and Egyptian fans descended on Omdurman (a sister city of Khartoum) for the game, which Algeria won 1-0, sending them and not Egypt to South Africa. Ironically, it was Antar Yahia who scored the winning goal. Even after the match the war of words continued. Whilst most of the world's press agreed that the aftermath had passed relatively peacefully, Egyptian media saw things differently. According to Egyptian football Web site Filgoal.com, tearful fans had phoned Egyptian TV shows from Sudan claiming to be under attack from knife-wielding Algerians. ""I don't know what to say. Damn the so-called Arab unity, we should no longer talk about it,"" presenter Ibrahim Hegazi angrily said on his Nile Sport TV show. ""We should review our situations. We can no longer bear such incidents."" President Mubarak told the Sudanese government, rather bluntly, that he would be watching the drama unfold on TV at home and would send in the army if need be. ""Egypt does not tolerate those who hurt the dignity of its sons [but] we don't want to be drawn into impulsive reactions. I am agitated too, but I restrain myself,"" he said afterwards in a televised speech to parliament. It was all news to the Sudanese government, who summoned the Egyptian ambassador, livid that media reports in Egypt had exaggerated the violence. FIFA charged the Egyptian FA over the attack on the Algerian team; they responded by threatening to pull out of international competition for two years. The Algerian embassy was the scene of another riot, this time by Egyptian fans angry at the pictures they had seen emerge from Sudan. Like in 1989, the aftermath will leave a bitter taste far beyond the football field. Unlike 1989, both teams may not have to wait two decades to revive the animosity: Algeria and Egypt play in January's African Cup of Nations and could meet in the knockout stages. FIFA, not to mention both governments, will pray that fate doesn't offer either side the chance for revenge.","Egypt played Algeria in a winner takes all battle for a place at the World Cup.
