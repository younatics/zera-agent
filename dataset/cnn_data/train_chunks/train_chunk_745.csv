A 300-foot cellphone tower in West Virginia collapsed Saturday and minutes later a smaller tower fell, killing two contractors and a firefighter, authorities said. The contractors Kyle Kirkpatrick, 32, from Hulbert Oklahoma and Terry Lee Richard, Jr, from Bokoshe, Oklahoma were tethered to the larger tower when it collapsed in Clarksburg, killing them, State Police Corporal Mark Waggamon said. Nutter Fort Fire Department firefighter 28-year-old Michael Dale Garrett, of Clarksburg, was killed when he was walking from his vehicle to the scene. Three dead: Two telecommunications towers that were being reinforced collapsed, killing two contractors and a firefighter . Tragic loss: This banner adorns the Nutter County Fire Department where Michael Garrett was a firefighter . Team: Michael Garrett (left) will be sorely missed by others in the Nutter Fort Fire Department . Family man: Kyle Kirkpatrick died after a communications tower he was working on collapsed . Young dad: Terry Lee Richard, Jr also died in the tragic accident . Two other contractors working on the larger tower were hurt and taken to a hospital. Waggamon described their injuries as serious but not life-threatening. Waggamon said three of the workers were more than 60 feet up on the tower. One of those workers was killed along with a co-worker who was about 20 feet up when the tower toppled. Two other workers at the site were not injured. Waggamon said the weight of the collapsed tower put stress on guide wires to the smaller tower. The crew was doing maintenance to strengthen the tower's support when the accident occurred, Waggamon said. He said the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration will investigate. The towers are owned by SBA . Communications, which hired workers from S&S Communications to . remove the tall tower's diagonal supports and replace them with new . ones. 'We . are deeply saddened by the loss of life and the injuries to the other . individuals and our prayers and concern go out to the families . involved,' SBA Communications said in a statement to Metro News. Two injured: A helicopter carries the injured contractors to hospital . Dangerous work: Police say the 300-foot tower fell before the contractors could even begin their work on it . Great heights: One of the men was 70 feet up the tower, the other was 20 feet high . Brave: Michael Garrett was killed as he ran from his vehicle to help the victims of the first tower collapse . 'SBA Communications is cooperating fully with any type of investigation being conducted by governmental agencies. We realize the sensitivity surrounding such an unexpected event and have mobilized our team to be on the scene to assist with any information needed.' Steven Thompson, a member of the Summit Park Volunteer Fire Department, said about three dozen people from eight fire departments in the area responded. Thompson said rescue personnel had to use four-wheel-drive and all-terrain vehicles because snow had made a mess of the gravel road leading to the site, which was on a ridge about 200 feet above a main road. He said the first crews still arrived 10 to 15 minutes after the call.","Two contractors were working on a 300-foot tower in West Virginia when it collapsed, killing them .

Three men accused of stealing a religious relic containing the blood of Pope John Paul II may have thrown it away believing it to be worthless, Italian police fear. The piece of blood-soaked cloth worn by the Pope when he was shot in a failed assassination attempt in 1981 was stolen on Saturday from a medieval sanctuary in the Abruzzo mountains. Police have recovered the metal frame used to hold the relic, following a search involving over 50 officers and sniffer dogs, but have not been able to find the patch of cloth itself. Assassination attempt: The ampule contains a piece of blood-soaked cloth that dates back to the 1981 assassination attempt on John Paul II on May 13 1981, in St. Peter's Square in Vatican City . Thieves sawed through iron bars on the . window, officials said, and took the relic (left) alongside a crucifix. There . was no CCTV or alarm in the chapel (right) Thieves ignored other items and focused on this, giving rise to speculation that it was Satanists . Two of the three men arrested over . the theft were described as drug addicts aged 23 and 24 who were known . to the police for a range of petty crimes. A . police spokesman said the men 'did not understand the relic's value' and 'cannot remember where they threw away the precious loot', according . to a report by the ANSA news agency. Pope John Paull II is due to be declared a Saint in April this year at which point the value of the relic would increase dramatically. President of the village cultural society, Pasquale Corriere, believed it had been a planned theft. He said: ‘It was no doubt stolen to order. The thieves touched nothing but the relic and the crucifix. ‘They . did not force the door of the sacristy or open the chest containing . donations, which convinces me that [the relic] was the target’. Close call: The Pope was shot and critically wounded when Mehmet Ali Agca (his gun is circled) shsot him four times while he was entering the square . Venerated since medieval times for their healing powers, religious relics still have the power to draw crowds. A . selection of artefacts associated with John Paul II is touring Europe, . as the Vatican prepares to officially declare the former Pope a saint in . April. The relic was . bestowed on the tiny sanctuary of Pietro della Ienca, on the mountain . peak of Gran Sasso, where the pontiff used to take skiing holidays. Grisly: Other remnants of John Paul's tenancy include a bullet-pierced cassock that the former pontiff was wearing at the time of the 1981 assassination attempt, a tuft of hair cut from the Pope's head a few days before his death and some blood-soaked gauze saved from an operation .

Fox News host Bill O'Reilly tackled Barack Obama on his affordable healthcare act and the 2012 Benghazi attack in a tense Super Bowl Sunday interview today. In the network's annual live pre-game show, President Obama was forced to defend himself against a barrage of Republican criticism. During a tense 15-minute interview, Obama hit back at O'Reilly, saying the Fox News network was to blame for promoting scandals. Pre-game tactics: Bill O'Reilly interviews Barack Obama on Super Bowl Sunday . Hard ball: Obama was quizzed by O'Reilly over claims that the IRS targeted right-wing groups . As he was questioned about Obamacare, the Benghazi raid and accusations that the IRS targeted right-wing groups like the Tea Party, the President took a shot at Fox. 'These kinds of things keep on surfacing in part because you and your TV station will promote them,' he told O'Reilly. The host seemed prepared for a tense interview, telling viewers beforehand: 'Although the President sometimes criticizes Fox News he knows the power of it.' O'Reilly opened the interview by saying he wanted to get some things 'on the record' before asking Obama why Secretary of Health and Human Services, Kathleen Sebelius, had not fired over the rocky roll out of the healthcare act. The President didn't give a direct answer, telling O'Reilly only that people were being 'held accountable'. Defense: Obama refused to answer when asked why Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius wasn't fired over the roll out of the healthcare act . Attack: O'Reilly questioned Obama over the handling of the Benghazi raid, above, that took place in 2012 . He also declined to say that the biggest . mistake of his presidency was telling Americans if they liked their . healthcare they could keep it, and argued that the website was working the . way it was supposed to. 'We've got 3 million people signed up so far. We're about a month behind where we anticipated we wanted to be,' he said. The President also defended his administration as O'Reilly questioned him about why officials initially described the attack in Benghazi, Libya, as a spontaneous mob protest over an anti-Islamic, American-made video. He rejected O'Reilly's 'notion that we would hide the ball for political purposes when a week later we all said in fact there was a terrorist attack taking place'. 'That wouldn't be a very good cover-up,' Obama said. And, he added there was 'not even a smidgen of corruption' contributing to the IRS targeting of Tea Party and other conservative groups when they applied for tax-exempt status. The President also refused to be drawn on which team would win tonight's Super Bowl. With the interview taking place just two hours before the Super Bowl got underway, Obama said the Denver Broncos and Seattle Seahawks were too evenly matched to pick a winner. He predicted a score of 24-21 but said he didn't know which side would come out on top. Just as fans of the two Super Bowl teams will find no common grouns, reaction to the interview was massively divided. Obama was accused on Twitter of dodging questions and being a liar, while O'Reilly was criticized for being disrespectful to a U.S. President.","Fox host tackled Obama on claims IRS targeted right-wing groups .

A mystery white van man filmed battering a cyclist in a vicious road rage attack has been let off without prosecution and only asked to write a letter of apology to his victim. Stephen Perrin, who wears a camera on his cycling helmet, was dragged off his bike and hit by the 36-year-old man close to a Birmingham police station. The footage shows the van driver overtaking Mr Perrin before pulling over and hitting him, shouting: 'you f****** p****, I'll f****** knock you out.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Attack: The white van man (left) chased cyclist Stephen Perrin down the street and attacked him - but was not prosecuted . Row: Olympic Gold medallist Chris Boardman has got involved after police only told the man to pay compensation and say sorry . West Midlands Police said the attacker was interviewed under caution at a police station, but was punished with a 'local resolution', claiming its 'hands were tied'. This agreement, introduced by the force three years ago, means the aggressor will pay the cyclist compensation and offer a written apology. The shocking footage has gone viral since Former Olympic cycling champion Chris Boardman saw it and shared it with his 80,000 followers on Twitter. He retweeted: 'Get Britain cycling:? There's a lot to do when @wmpolice think it's okay NOT to charge/warn 4 this.' Footage: After an altercation on the road, the attacker got out of his van and gave chase . Floored: The cyclist was then dragged to the ground during an attack where the blows are heard clearly . Clambering: To avoid further punches Stephen scrambles to his feet on the Birmingham pavement . Mr Perrin and scores of other cyclists have reacted with anger that police failed to act, who stated they were powerless due to Home Office guidelines. West Midlands Police responded on Twitter to Mr Boardman saying: 'Cyclist accepts under Home Office guidance that officers' hands were tied and were unable to take him to court.' Writing on Facebook, Mr Perrin said: 'This was obviously totally unprovoked-the internet has named and shamed him. This is all very overwhelming and I'm a little bit frightened.' Referring to himself as 'CCStev' on Twitter, he added: 'This was a violent, unprovoked attack that has no place in society and I'm very disappointed and angry that the driver will not face criminal consequences. 'The driver was brought in for interview and initially claimed provocation, that I kicked his van and kicked him in the chest. 'As the victim I was given the choice of the driver receiving a caution or I could accept a local resolution, the terms of which that I would receive an amount in compensation and a written apology. I'm far from happy about it but reluctantly accepted the resolution. 'I don't think the police are to blame but the decisions made by Government departments that govern them.' Abuse: After the initial attack the white van man, 36, then swore and threatened more violence . Withdrawal: With a bus stopped next to his vehicle the attacker then tells the cyclist to call the police if he likes . He was riding along Woodbridge Road in the affluent Moseley suburb of the city on March 16 when the incident happened. An eyewitness said: 'It was a very brutal and unprovoked attack so I am very surprised to hear the guy has got away with it. The driver went mad and kept punching the cyclist. He was very angry - a case of small man syndrome if you ask me. 'As a cyclist myself, it is unnerving to know that people can get away with this sort of violent behaviour.' Mr Perrin calls himself 'Black Country Ste' on Twitter and Youtube and has uploaded more than 100 videos from his travels around Birmingham, some of which result in verbal confrontations with drivers. The footage has now been removed from YouTube, due to its policy on 'shocking and disgusting content.' Police Station: West Midlands Police's Moseley HQ, within sight of where the attack happened . The van is operated by a pet business based in Moseley called Weird and Wonderful, which has deleted its Facebook and Twitter accounts as a result of the complaints it was receiving from cyclists. The company has also disabled the online feedback form on its website. Meanwhile, the wife of the driver, says she has been forced to call in police after receiving hundreds of email and phone threats after the footage of the attack went viral on the internet showing her business van. The woman, who does not want to be identified, said there was 'no excuse' for her husband's behaviour and added that he did not work at the business. A spokeswoman for West Midlands Police said they were aware of the alleged threats.

A Seattle restaurant has thrown out a customer who refused to take off his Google Glass. Nick Starr was at the Lost Lake Cafe in the city and was wearing the glasses, which allow users to take pictures and record audio or video, when he was asked to remove them. After refusing to take them off, he was eventually asked to leave. He complained about the incident on his Facebook page and suggested the restaurant's owner considers the employment of its night manager. Scroll down for video . Dispute: Nick Starr left a Seattle restaurant after he was ordered to remove his Google Glass . 'She tells me that . the owner's other restaurant doesn't allow Google Glass and that I would . have to either put it away or leave,' he wrote. 'I asked to see where it was policy for Glass to be disallowed at Lost . Lake. She said she couldn't provide any and when asked to speak with . management she stated she was the night manager.' Starr says he's eaten at Lost Lake with his $1,500 headset before and asked to see where the restaurant's anti-Glass policy was posted. He and his specs eventually left. The episode has raised the debate about how invasive the gadget is. After refusing to remove the glasses, Starr and his boyfriend left the venue. He vented on his Facebook post, demanding an apology from the restaurant and calling for the woman's employment to be terminated. He added that he thought it was bizarre that the restaurant asked customers to shares images on social networking sites of their experiences there, but banned the Glass. Scene: The manager at the Lost Lake Cafe asked him to remove the glasses in accordance with their policy . Anger: Restaurant owner David Meinert, pictured, said he thought the glasses were invasive . The Lost Lake Cafe has refused to apologize, saying that they have other customers' interests in mind. They shot back at Starr with their own Facebook post, outlining its policy. 'We recently had to ask a rude . customer to leave because of their insistence on wearing and operating . Google Glasses inside the restaurant,' the statement said. 'We . kindly ask our customers to refrain from wearing and operating Google . Glasses inside Lost Lake. We also ask that you not videotape anyone . using any other sort of technology. 'If you do wear your Google Glasses . inside, or film or photograph people without their permission, you will . be asked to stop, or leave.

Night out: Starr was out with his boyfriend, Brian (left), when they were approached by the manager . Fan: Starr said he wears the glasses everywhere and argued you can also take pictures with cell phones . Owner David Meinert, who banned Google Glass at another one of his restaurants earlier this year, said he felt uneasy about the device. 'I think they're invasive and they make people uncomfortable,' he told KOMO News. 'More than that they make me uncomfortable, and it's my place.' But Starr countered that he believes Google Glass is no more intrusive than cell phones with cameras that are also capable of taking images. 'I think privacy is vapor now,' Starr said. 'There are cameras everywhere. There are recording devices everywhere.' 'I would love an explanation, apology, clarification, and if the staff member was in the wrong and lost the owner money last night and also future income as well, that this income be deducted from her pay or her termination.' Take it off or get out: Seattle may be home for tech giants Amazon and Microsoft, but Google Glass isn't welcome in one local diner . Starr's request for the managers termination has been met with vitriol on his personal Facebook page which had remained public throughout the controversy, although at lunchtime on Sunday it appeared that he had removed his profile. 'What kind of pathetic loser asks for someone to be fired because they asked him to put his toy away? What kind of overly indulged manchild throws a hissy about something so inconsequential? Grow up loser!' writes one poster. 'People like you give tech people and people in your generation a bad name. You don't have the RIGHT to use technology any way you want, anywhere you want. Maybe we need to stop worrying so much about our RIGHTS and more about doing what is right.

The Royal Shakespeare Company is gearing up to put on two of its fastest selling shows on stage this month - both adaptations of highly-acclaimed Hilary Mantel novels. Tickets for Wolf Hall and Bring Up The Bodies, Mantel's Tudor court thrillers, sold out in hours after they went on sale in the spring. Hilary Mantel, who became the first British writer to win the Man Booker Prize for Fiction twice, is having both books adapted for stage . Now the eagerly-awaited productions will take to the stage at the Swan theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon before they are expected to transfer to London in the new year. The play will star Ben Miles, best known for appearing in the TV shows Coupling and Cold Feet, and Nathaniel Parker, star of the BBC's Inspector Lynley Mysteries. Writer Mike Poulton, who had to adapted Mantel's second book less than a year after it was published, said: 'We had to create a viable play, rather than just try to put the novel on its feet â€“ because you can't do that. 'In a novel you take your time, you enjoy the pictures it creates in your mind, you go back and reread.' Going head-to-head: Ben Miles (left), who played Patrick in the BBC sitcom Coupling, and (right) Mark Rylance, playing Richard III, will both play Tudor schemer Thomas Cromwell in stage and screen versions of the Mantel novel Wolf Hall .

Mr Poulton, who has worked closely with Mantel, told The Observer he is planning some 'very telling dances' to tease out the tension in her books. 'The . one thing you can't do is condense it and say we'll do broad . brushstrokes. You can't ask an actor to play broad brushstrokes.' Wolf Hall is also set to be brought to the small screen in a production commissioned by the BBC and America's Masterpiece Theatre. The six-part serial will follow the meteoric rise of Cromwell in the Tudor court, from his lowly start as the son of a blacksmith to becoming King Henry VIIIâ€™s closest advisor.

Puffing casually on a cigarette, a farmhand dangles a white fox by its tail as he clubs it to death with a stick. The method is simple yet brutal - and just one of a variety of ways China's controversial Fox Farms slaughter the animals in the name of fashion. Others include breaking their necks under a boot or stomping on their heads. Activists say they are the lucky ones. The more docile foxes who don't struggle are simply strung up and skinned alive to save their slaughterers time and energy. Those who live nearby say the stench of death hangs in the air while chilling howls of fear and pain can be heard rising from the compound night and day. In the name of fashion: Puffing casually on a cigarette, a farmhand dangles a white fox by its tail as he clubs it to death with a stick . When the fur is finally peeled off over the animals’ heads, their naked, bloody bodies are thrown onto a pile of those who have gone before them. Yet even with their pelt removed, some are still alive, gasping for air and blinking slowly for as long as ten minutes as they wait for death, say activists. Their furs are then shipped off to be worn as hats or coats by fashionistas across the world. Some of the pictures to have emerged from these farms are too graphic to show on this website. Animal-rights activists are demanding action to stop this wholesale slaughter of thousands of foxes for the global fashion industry every year. Waiting to die: The foxes are held in tiny cages awaiting their turn to die as others are slaughtered before their eyes . But owners of the controversial Fox Farms say that their margins are so slim that they cannot afford to give the foxes humane deaths as campaigners demand. Instead the animals are kept in tiny cages until autumn when they are dragged out through the mud and beaten with clubs or sticks in time for winter fashion collections. Activists say they even spotted some of the animals being kicked or stamped on to kill them. And all of the killings happen before the eyes of animals awaiting their turn, frantically trying to escape. Hungry market: The pelts are left to dry on planks of wood at the edge of the compound. They are then shipped off to be worn as hats or coats by fashionistas across the world . Only a few are spared to breed next year's crop. Lanhu farm, near Xi'an city, Jilin Province, is one of many such slaughterhouses in the rural heartland of northeast China. The activists have been backed by locals who don't work on the farm complaining that the screams and cries as the beasts killed are particularly distressing for children. The animals kept on the farm include the blue fox, the common red fox and the raccoon. Farm manager On Kung said that it cost about £30 to provide the food to raise one of the animals for nine months until it is fully grown and ready for slaughter. And they were only paid around about £60 when they sold it to the profit margin was very low. He said most farms had between 200 and 300 animals and the money they earned had to keep them running all year hence the need to keep costs low.","These horrific pictures were taken at Lanhu Farm, in Jilin Province, China .

Scotland would be more vulnerable to a catastrophic terrorist attack if Alex Salmond succeeds with his bid to break up Britain, a new report from the Ministry of Defence will claim this week. Britain’s top defence officials have produced a damning 86-page assessment of the impact that separation would have on Scotland’s security, which warns of the terrifying threat to the everyday lives of Scots. The devastating dossier will show that the tiny defence budget proposed by the SNP could heighten the risk of a terror attack which could close down the water, gas or electricity supplies to every home and business in the country. Terror risk: Scotland would be more vulnerable to a catastrophic terrorist attack if Alex Salmond succeeds with his bid to break up Britain, the report will claim. Above, Mr Salmond addresses a rally of pro-independence campaigners in Edinburgh last month . It is expected to say that a separate Scotland may also be unable to protect itself from a ‘cyber attack’ which could see criminals or rogue states raid the bank accounts of hard-working people across the country. And it will also warn that the country would face a defence jobs Armageddon, including the shutdown of Scotland’s shipyards and the mass withdrawal of private firms in the defence sector, leading to the loss of tens of thousands of vital jobs. The report will attempt to highlight the risks to a separate Scotland by showing the huge efforts already carried out to protect Scotland as part of the UK, including defence against the threat from foreign nations and terrorists and from attacks on the country’s everyday infrastructure, such as water and electricity supplies and phone and computer connections. Debate: Speaking exclusively to the Scottish Mail on Sunday, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond claimed the SNP's plans are a 'dagger poised at the heart of Scotland's industrial infrastructure' Speaking exclusively to the Scottish Mail on Sunday ahead of publication of the report on Tuesday, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond evoked the language of the battlefield by claiming that the SNP’s plans are a ‘dagger poised at the heart of Scotland’s industrial infrastructure’. He revealed that UK networks are under constant attack, with 400,000 attacks on the government’s internal systems in the last year alone. He said: ‘Everything that I’ve seen says to me that the Scottish Government isn’t really interested in defence. What it has said on defence looks like it has been made up on the back of a fag packet. ‘Those who are promoting the case for Scottish independence owe the Scottish people a proper explanation of how they would be kept safe as they go about their daily business, how their families would be kept safe and how their jobs would be protected, because the defence industry is going to be decimated by what the Scottish Government is proposing. ‘The report will show the challenge of providing security for Scottish people; security in the sense of defence but also about securing the everyday infrastructure they use in their daily lives, making sure the water supply and utilities are safe from attack, that computer networks used in the workplace are not compromised and their details vulnerable. ‘It is about the impact on Scottish industry and the Scottish industrial base and the impact on jobs and employment- and the impact on prosperity and ordinary domestic security for people across Scotland.’ The report will warn that 9000 direct jobs would be at risk at the Coulport and Faslane naval bases by the end of the decade as a result of the SNP’s intention to remove Trident from Scotland if it secures a yes vote in next year’s referendum. Rally: Thousands of pro-independence campaigners marched through Edinburgh on September 21 . Pro-independence: The rally was the second of three large marches held in the run up to next year's referendum . It will also suggest that Scotland’s shipyards could lose all of their vital orders from the MOD, because it does not hand contracts to foreign countries, which could lead to the decimation of the vital shipbuilding industry. And it will say that independence could result in the mass withdrawal of private defence firms from Scotland, as they will not want to be at risk of losing MOD work. That could prove to be disastrous for the 16,000 defence jobs based in Scotland. No major defence firms have publicly stated their concerns about separation, but they have raised their concerns privately. Mr Hammond said he has urged company bosses to speak up on the risks and expects some to do so in the next year. It is a real dagger poised at the heart of Scotland's industrial infrastructure . Philip Hammond . ‘We have been making the case to the defence industry that they need to speak up,’ he said.  ‘I hope that as we move through next year towards the referendum they will at least be frank with their own workforces about these issues. ‘It is thousands and thousands of jobs across Scotland at risk.  It is the shipbuilding industry, it is the hi-tech industrial base – people like Selex – it is the 9000 direct jobs in Coulport and Faslane by the end of the decade that are at risk because of the Scottish Government’s threat to Faslane. 'Then of course there are the thousands and thousands of jobs in the supply chain. ‘It is a real dagger poised at the heart of Scotland’s industrial infrastructure.’ Last week, the Mail on Sunday revealed that Mr Hammond is building a new offensive ‘cyber strike force’ costing up to £500 million to stave off the threat of attacks on Britain’s systems. The spending is in addition to hundreds of millions of pounds spent every year on defensive systems. Mr Hammond said building the whole cyber defensive system from scratch in an independent Scotland would need ‘huge fixed cost investment’. He said: ‘There are significant economies of scale and it is clear that the UK is able to deliver a level of cyber protection for all the people of the United Kingdom as they go about their business and daily lives in a way that an independent Scotland would find very difficult to do, especially within the budgets that have been set out already. Cyber force: Mr Hammond poses in the top-secret bunker beneath the Ministry of Defence, from where the cyber wars of the future will be fought to starve off the threat of attacks on Britain's systems . ‘We have to be able to defend that IT infrastructure against attacks, whether from state actors, terrorists, criminal hackers, and that will become increasingly important in the future.  The financial system is a regular target of cyber attackers.’ The new MOD report will be the fifth in a series of ‘Scotland Analysis’ papers produced by the UK Government to assess the implications of independence. It is will cover all areas of defence in the UK and highlight the economic and employment benefits of the industry to Scotland, as well as the damage that independence could do. It will also show how Scottish members of the armed forces can enjoy ‘varied and interesting’ careers in one of the world’s most highly-regarded forces – and warn that they might not want to leave the UK’s forces for a smaller standalone Scottish Army. Significantly, it will also highlight that existing units based in Scotland are part of the UK Armed Forces – meaning a separate Scotland could not simply ‘co-opt’ them. The report will say: ‘Personnel might very well not wish to leave the UK Armed Forces to join much smaller forces, not least because of strong bonds of loyalty. ‘From a defence perspective, the transition to independence would therefore be extremely complex, raising serious questions over how an operational capability for an independent Scottish state could be managed.’","Independent Scotland would be more vulnerable to terrorist attacks, a new report will claim this week .

State Police spokesman Emmanuel Gutierrez said it's unknown what caused Saturday afternoon's derailment on Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold property near the community of Bayard, about 75 miles northwest of Las Cruces. It's unclear what preceded the derailment. The eight rail cars being pulled by the locomotive weren't forced into the ravine. Instead, they remained either on or near the tracks. At least half of the eight train cars had tilted on their sides, but none of the iron ore being carried by the train had spilled out.

The Denver Broncos soared into the Super Bowl riding the NFL's best offense on the arm of future Hall of Fame quarterback Peyton Manning and limped away a 43-8 loser. Manning came into the big game as good as ever after setting regular season records for touchdowns (55) and passing yards (5,477) but failed to live up to mile high expectations in what was expected to be the signature moment of his career, . The Seattle Seahawks league-best defense intercepted the future hall of famer twice en route to blocking his bid to tie brother Eli Manning with two championships. Alone in a sea of thousands: Manning appeared disconnected and out of sync almost the whole game . Ineffective: Manning #18, shown throwing an interception, has been unable to establish a rhythm early on . Intercepted!: Strong safety Kam Chancellor #31 of the Seattle Seahawks intercepts a pass from Peyton Manning . Manning was the story of the week, all eyes were on him - especially in brother Eli's home stadium - and he came out flat and only got worse as the game went on. Seattle brought an unrelenting pass rush and . swarming coverages that kept Manning's internal clock from ever developing a normal rhythm . despite him completing a Super Bowl-record 33 passes. 'They havenâ€™t played a defense that flies around like we do, that hits like we do, and we just do it every single play,' said linebacker Bobby Wagner. 'We figured that the longer and longer the game went, they were going to fall eventually.' Manning never had a chance. Seattle coach Pete Carroll's defense knocked the Broncos all over the field and intercepted Manning twice in the first half, with Super Bowl MVP linebacker Malcolm Smith returning a pick 69 yards for a touchdown. Trouble from the start: A bad snap sent the ball flying over Manning's head during the Broncos' first offensive play of the game . Feb 2, 2014; East Rutherford, NJ, USA; Denver Broncos running back Knowshon Moreno (27) recovers a fumble in the end zone for a safety that gave Seattle a 2-0 lead . The five-time MVP overthrew receivers . all night, threw wobbly passes and rarely had time to scan the field as . Seattle's unrelenting pass rush constantly kept him under pressure. 'Give Seattle a lot of credit, they are an excellent football team and they caused a lot of our mistakes,' Manning said. His . troubles started when a loud crowd led to a high snap that sailed over . his head and resulted in a safety that gave Seattle an early 2-0 lead . and the ball. His first . interception led to Seattle's second field goal, the hole began to grow, . but no one thought Manning would be unable to bring the Broncos back. On the money: Seattle Seahawks kicker Steven Hauschka (4) kicks a 31 yard field goal during the first half of the Super Bowl . Helpless: Manning watches action against the Seahawks from the bench during the second half . Denver's . next drive ended when Seahawks safety Kam Chancellor intercepted an . errant Manning throw that resulted in Seattle's first touchdown a few . plays later when running back Marshawn Lynch took a one yard hand off in . for the score only a few minutes into the second quarter. The score was quickly 15-0, Manning was in a manageable hole until the wheels finally came off. He . began the Broncos next possession by completing 7 of 9 passes for 47 . yards and finally started to resemble the quarterback who won his fifth . MVP award this season. The . sixth pass was a death knell, it fluttered through the air and was . picked off by Super Bowl MVP linebacker Marcus Smith - he returned it 69 . yards for a touchdown. Never comfortable: Manning pauses during the second half of the Super Bowl . Pick six!: Seahawks' Malcolm Smith (53) intercepts a pass intended for Denver Broncos' Knowshon Moreno (27), which was returned 69 yards for a touchdown . The wobbling pass resembled the ducks . that Seattle cornerback Richard Sherman said the 17-year veteran throws . at this stage of his career. 'We needed to play really well in order to win, and we didnâ€™t come anywhere close to that,' said Manning. Manning's . dismal first half was punctuated by another duck thrown on 4th and two . with 1:01 left, it barely missed being intercepted. He finished the first half 17 of 23 for 104 . yards and was shown walking off the field with his tail between his legs . before time even expired in the second quarter - one that is likely to . haunt him for many years. End of the road: Manning walks off the field after the Broncos lost to the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl XLVIII . The nightmare only continued in the . second when Denver kick Matthew Prater went for hang time on the opening . kick as he tried to give his coverage team enough time to get to the . dangerous Harvin. Harvin's return put Manning and the Broncos in a 29-0 hole they never recovered from. The sure-fire hall of famer overthrew several receivers in the second half and looked nothing like the Peyton Manning who led the Broncos to 13 regular season wins in 2013. Manning was able to put together a Super Bowl-record 34 completions, but the historic mark rang hollow as he failed to earn his second championship. He completed a record 13 receptions to receiver Demarius Thomas, including his lone touchdown, but it was too little too late. The former Indianapolis Colt fell to 1-2 . in the big game. The Seahawks defense added insult to injury late in the . fourth quarter when the ball was knocked out of his hands for a fumble . in what amounted to garbage time. Dejected: Manning walks off the field after not converting on fourth down during the fourth quarter . Manning finished 34 of 49 for 280 yards with one touchdown and two interceptions - good for a 73.5 rating. It may have been the last game he plays in the NFL, and it was one of the worst performances he ever turned in. 'To finish this way is very disappointing,' Manning admitted. 'It's a bitter pill to swallow.' The all-pro quarterback has stated he wants to return next year, but cannot do so until given clearance by doctors that will check his surgically repaired neck in the next few months. Manning hadn't missed a start in his first 12 season in the league until a severe neck injury cost him the entire 2011 season and saw him released by the Indianapolis Colts - the team that drafted him. His career was feared over then, he came back a vengeance. He might not come back this time.","The game's first score came after a snap sailed over Peyton Manning's head and into the end zone for a safety .

It is already used to help prevent heart attacks and strokes, and now researchers believe the humble aspirin could also hold the key to warding off dementia and cancer. The claim came yesterday at the launch of the largest ever study into the health benefits of the everyday medicine, which has long been thought of as a health-booster. A study of 15,000 people aged over 70 will be the most extensive clinical trial on the use of aspirin to prevent disease in the elderly. Life-saver: Aspirin is already used to prevent strokes and heart attacks and now researchers have discovered it could also help fight off cancer and dementia . Research team leader Professor Mark Nelson, from Hobart’s Menzies Research Institute in Tasmania, Australia, said: 'Remember aspirin is an over-the-counter medication; you don’t need a doctor to prescribe it, you don’t need a doctor to tell you you’ve turned 70. So this is something that can be done very simply, very cheaply if we find that it’s an effective strategy.' Prof Nelson said the study starts next summer and results are expected in 2018. Millions of people who take the pill to fight heart disease or the risk of a stroke benefit from its effectiveness at thinning the blood and how it helps to prevent clotting. It cuts the danger of further heart attacks or strokes by at least 23 per cent. Hope: The research could pave the way for a breakthrough in preventing the onset of dementia, which affects thousands of elderly people (file picture) Research has shown regular users have a lower risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease, the main form of dementia. Scientists believe its protective effect may be due to its anti-clotting action helping blood flow to the brain. Prof Nelson said: 'There’s a number of reasons why it might. The number one reason would be related to stroke. If you have a stroke you knock out a large area of your brain and therefore your ability to think is affected. 'There is also the possibility of lots of what are called microinfarcts, which means small areas of brain getting knocked off very slowly.' Research has also shown that aspirin may have a role in fighting cancer, particularly gastro-intestinal cancers. Wonder drug: It is hoped taking the pills could also stave off cancers in the gastro-intestinal tract . Prof Nelson said: 'There’s some very good evidence around to suggest aspirin may prevent cancers, especially cancers of the gastro-intestinal tract. 'Now that makes sense because you take it orally so in aspirin you’ve got that natural component.' In the study – in the journal Contemporary Clinical Trials – the team wants to establish whether the benefits of a low dose of aspirin outweigh the risks linked to its use. Prof Nelson said: 'If you’ve never had a heart attack or stroke before, what’s called primary prevention, we really don’t know in an elderly population whether you’re more likely to get benefit from taking the aspirin, maybe related to stroke or heart attack. 'Or more likely to be harmed, because aspirin actually can cause an increase in your risk of haemorrhagic stroke, bleeding type strokes and it can also cause bleeding into the stomach.' He cautioned about the 'catch-22' of aspirin, which can also lead some people to have a major stroke because of increased blood flow. Alzheimer’s Society research chief Dr Doug Brown said: 'We already know that prescribed aspirin has the potential to prevent heart disease and stroke in people at risk of these conditions, and it would be an additional benefit if it could delay the onset of dementia.' Dr Simon Ridley of Alzheimer’s Research UK said: 'Systematic reviews of previous aspirin trials have so far showed no evidence that the drugs can benefit people with dementia, but the studies done to date have been relatively small. Large-scale controlled trials could provide more conclusive evidence.' He added: 'We look forward to seeing the results.'","Australian researchers also think the drug could ward off stomach cancer .

The collection, which includes a range of casual and smart day wear, is priced between  £14.99 - £199.99. On the auction site, bids have gone up to £400 for individual pieces, with some accruing a staggering 100 per cent mark up on retail price. Scroll down for video .

H&M told mail Online that ‘guests at our Isabel Marant Pour H&M global press event held in Paris last week were given the opportunity to shop the collection in a pop-up store’. It's not unusual for popular lines to go on sale in advance of a launch, supplied by the fashion insiders invited to events such as these . What is unusual is that almost all of the items offered on the auction site won't be dispatched until November 14. Website Fashionista takes this to mean that the sellers don't actually have the goods.They've reached out for an explanation but received no responses. They point out the majority of the items for sale are from a couple of UK sellers who claim to have certain items in every size and who will not send until the day the collection launches in the shops. There is no indication of pre-order purchasing on the H&M website and no more VIP shopping events taking place beforehand. It's a all a bit of a mystery - we'd take our chances in store on November 14, especially since the ebay prices are higher than the high street ones. This is not the first time that the Swedish fashion house has experienced early re-sell. The exact same thing occured last year when the brand launched its collaborative collection with Belgian fashion designer Maison Martin Margiela after a star-studded launch in New York. The Isabel Marant collection for H&M features the designer's signature urban, boho, Parisian style.

Speaking about the venture, Marant commented that she is ’flattered by this collaboration: H&M works with the best designers and this invitation is an exciting honour. ‘I aim at creating something real, that women want to wear in their everyday lives, with a certain carelessness, which I think is very Parisian: you dress up, but do not pay too much attention and still look sexy. ‘The collection is infused with this kind of easiness and attitude. Everything can be mixed following one’s own instincts: my take on fashion is all about personality.’ Tailored look: Coat, £99.99; white jeans, £59.99; top, £59.99; boots, £149.99 .

GammaPix uses scanning technology that analyses videos and photos taken using a smartphone’s camera. The camera looks for a particular ‘signature’ left behind by gamma rays, similar to how a Geiger counter or other radiation scanner works. It measures the rate at which these rays hit the camera’s sensor to determine radiation levels and will warn users if they are being exposed to harmful rays. The technology and software can also be used with images from surveillance cameras and webcams. Image Insight said: ‘The technology is sensitive enough to detect, within seconds, dangerously high levels of radiation so that you can quickly get away.’ It added the software also collects and saves radiation records, from minutes to hours, to detect weaker radioactivity sources or normal background radioactivity. GammaPix can additionally be used to detect ‘radioactivity in everyday life’ such as exposure on airplanes, from medical patients or from contaminated products. The app measures the rate at which gamma rays hit the smartphone camera’s sensor during a scan, to determine radiation levels. A full scan takes around five minutes, pictured left, but will warn a user immediately if a dangerous amount is detected. Scans can also be recorded and stored, pictured right . In military and federal tests it has been used to detect hazards from simulated terrorist attacks, dirty bombs, or hidden radioactive materials. One recent test took place at the Texas A&M Engineering Extension Service's Disaster City training grounds. A town was made to look like it had been hit by a twister and the first trainees to arrive on site used GammaPix to scan for radiation. These scans were then sent to a central command post thought software called GeoSuite, currently used to share information with the authorities following a natural disaster. Image Insight said users can scan an area and receive a complete radiation reading within five minutes, although dangerous levels will be reported as soon as they are detected. A similar app called Tawkon Radiation Detector app, pictured, was rejected by Apple because it could be used to calculate how much radiation was being emitted by mobiles and mobile phone masts. Apple said the app could confuse users and potentially frighten them and this was irresponsible . The developers were tasked with creating the app three years ago under a $679,000 contract with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Insight also got funding and support from the U.S. Department of Defense, the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (U.S. Department of Homeland Security), and the Transportation Research Board (U.S. National Academy of Sciences). It has now been made available to the public for Android and iOS phones and tablets and costs £3.21 or £2.99 on the respective app stores. Apple has previously rejected radiation scanning apps from its store, including the Tawkon Radiation Detector, for being 'irresponsible'. Tawkon's app was rejected because it could be used to calculate how much radiation was being emitted by mobiles and mobile phone masts, which Apple said could confuse users and potentially frighten them. Image Insight is working on an additional feature for GammaPix that lets users upload data, log onto forums and compare readings with others in a particular area to help establish which locations are safe or unsafe.","GammaPix scans for radiation using a smartphone camera sensor .

Thames Water sparked fury yesterday when it announced it will not pay corporation tax for up to a decade. Britain’s biggest water supplier has already been berated for racking up more than £1billion in unpaid taxes. But as it reported soaring profits after the summer heatwave, finance director Stuart Siddall said: ‘It will be seven to ten years until we pay tax.’ Vetoed: Thames Water wanted to impose an extra increase on bills of eight per cent, but regulator Ofwat said there was no evidence it was necessary . Labour’s Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Commons Public Accounts Committee, called it ‘deeply unfair’, saying Thames Water – which is owned by an Australian consortium – had an ‘obligation to pay their fair share in tax’. Tax accountant Richard Murphy, who helped expose tax avoidance by Starbucks, said: ‘The reality is that much of this will never be paid. ‘They are never going to stop spending money on infrastructure, which means they will probably never pay tax. Companies like this have to say when and if they will ever pay tax.’ Troubled: Last month Thames Water had a 8 per cent price rise slapped down by a regulator . Thames Water can delay tax payments under government rules as it invests large amounts on new pipes and sewers. Its planned £4.2billion ‘super-sewer’ under London means it will not be due to pay tax for years. The company’s sales rose 8 per cent to £976.5million between April and September, with pre-tax profits up by a fifth to £134.2million. Last month, its plans to hike prices by 8 per cent were slapped down by regulator Ofwat. Thames Water said last night it would use any extra money from its capital allowances to help customers who struggle to pay their bills.","Britain's biggest water supplier already owes the taxman £1billion .

If seeing The Hunger Games' Peeta and Finnickâ€™s defined muscles and sleek physiques has left you looking at your man and wishing he was rather more fit than fat, maybe he needs an arena makeover? London-based outdoor exercise company, Fitness Playground, is just one place now running fitness sessions inspired by the mega movie. Trainers Pete Meldrum and Dan Nixon use the urban environment to whip their clients into shape. 'We use rooftops, tunnels and anything else there is to give you a workout that involves both strength training and aerobic training,' explains Pete. Scroll down for video . Hunger Games' newest cast member Sam Claflin shows off his amazingly toned structure . To coincide with the Hunger Games: Catching Fire film release, they've picked up on the key elements of the Hunger Games tribute training and put together a workout that incorporates strength training, combat training and running. 'We've brought a boxing coach in and introduced some rock climbing sessions as well,' says Dan. 'It's all about making sure that you're training to be functionally fit. You can do all the bicep curls in the world, but that's not the same as having enough upper body strength to climb a tree if you're being chased by someone.' While normally the boys reckon it can take a couple of months to whip people into the lean, mean, fighting machines you see in the arena, they're planning an intensive five-week Hunger Games-inspired course, Train Like A Tribute, that comprises 3 combat sessions, 2 climbing sessions and 5 strength sessions as well as a physio session, lifestyle consultation and diet plan based on a hunter-gatherer Paleo diet. '99 per cent of looking that good is diet,' says Pete. 'If you don't fuel yourself the right way, you won't get the most from your training sessions. And there's no point having tight abs if they're hidden under layers of fat.' If you're not in London - and can't find the Â£160 you'd need to Train Like A Tribute, don't worry. Below, Dan and Pete give us a quick rundown of a workout that you can do without a climbing wall or boxing trainer, at home, or in the park - for free. Beefing up: Actor Sam Clafin aka Finnick Odair in The Hunger Games . Matching muscles: Josh Hutcherson (Peeta Mellark) worked out for his role . Liam Hemsworth who plays Gale Hawthorne shows off his toned shape in The Hunger Games: Catching Fire . The Circuit . 'Circuit training is great because you can vary it according to your fitness and if you can really only spare 10 minutes, you can pack a lot in. We recommend doing each exercise for a minute and taking a rest of anything up to a minute in between exercises. As you get fitter, decrease the rest period so that your heart rate stays up and you're getting an aerobic workout as well as a strength one. Your exercise circuit should start with squats and lunges as these work the biggest muscles in the body, and getting them fired up is good for burning fat. Then press-ups which will work your upper body, and you also need to work your back. This is trickier, but if you work with a partner, you can try pulling someone up off the ground with one arm (a bit like helping a fellow tribute who's fallen) - this will work your back. Finally, include some bicep curls using bottles of water, and some tricep dips on the side of a bench. The Combos . Once you've got the hang of these moves, you want to try combining them - and adding in props - because in real life - and in the arena - you never use simply one muscle group. Lunging with a kettlebell will give you a good idea of the sort of muscles you need to train to swordfight an enemy, while pulling back on a dynaband fixed to a door handle or a railing simulates the action that Katniss uses when drawing back her bow. The Running . While back-to-back strength training can also give you an aerobic workout, to really get your heart pumping, you need to hit the road. Either intersperse your run with strength exercises - maybe you do a set of squats every couple of hundred metres, or burpees every third lamp post. Think about how the tributes have to move in the arena. They can be moving at a very slow pace for a while and then, when confronted by danger, they're forced to literally run for their lives. You can recreate this sort of exercise by interspersing a steady jog with sprints. The Hunger Games star Liam Hemsworth shows off his striking physique and style . The Diet . In . the arena you survive on what you can forage and what you can kill. There's not enough time to cultivate rice and potatoes and all those . sorts of carbohydrate-heavy ingredients, so that's what this . hunter-gatherer diet relies on. It's basically about eating meat and two . veg - cutting out all the sugar and processed food that tends to . clutter our diet. Think about eating to fuel you for what you're doing that day, rather than just eating the same every day - and, if you're doing it seriously, prepare to feel pretty lousy for two weeks as your body gets used to living without sugar.

The death toll in the New York Metro-North train crash could rise - with investigators looking for more bodies trapped under the wreckage. Heavy-lifting cranes are being brought in to move the carriages, strewn on the tracks in The Bronx, New York. Officials believe they have accounted for everyone on board and emergency services have searched the train thoroughly, but they cannot rule out the possibility that more dead bodies are buried. Three of the four confirmed dead -  two men and two women - were thrown from the train on impact and there are fears that could have happened to more passengers. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

Glowing review: Rockefeller's father defended the engineer as a dependable professional who loves trains . Steve Morello, a spokesperson for . Metropolitan Transportation Administration (MTA), said: 'The police and . fire department have thoroughly searched the carriages, using a variety . of equipment and specially trained dogs. ‘They . went everywhere they could go in the search’, he said. ‘But there is no . passenger manifest on a train so it is impossible to be 100 per cent . certain everyone has been accounted for. 'A crane is being brought in, which should be here soon and will be able to lift the carriages. 'We will be on hand to assist in that operation.' Three . of the four people were killed when they were ejected from the . southbound train, the fourth fatality was discovered inside one of the . overturned train cars, officials said. Multiple witnesses have claimed . the train was going too fast. At . least 63 people were injured in the wreck, officials added.

Investigators . from the National Transportation Safety Board have been on the scene . since 12.30pm and have recovered the train's black box, a spokesperson . said. The NTSB expects to be on the scene for over a week. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said the train's recording device would help answer some questions about the underlying cause of the derailment. 'The black box will say what the speed was, whether the brakes were applied before the emergency brakes,' he told CBS. Look away: Emergency responders hold a white sheet over a victim . Solemn duty: A police officer stands guard over a body near the crash . A rescuer helps an injured woman leave after the Metro-North train derailed on route to Grand Central Station . The governor added that the accident 'would've been much, much worse if this had happened during the week.' The Grand Central Station-bound . Metro-North commuter train jumped the tracks near the Spuyten-Duyvil . Station just before 7.30am Sunday morning.

'This is the worse accident scene I’ve ever worked, there was blood everywhere.' Family man: Writer James Lovell, 58, a married father of four, has been identified as one of the four victims of the derailment . This evening, information slowly began to trickle out about the four deceased victims - two men and two women. One of the victims has been identified as 58-year-old Jim Lovell, the husband of Philipstown Deputy Supervisor Nancy Montgomery and a father of four.

The other three victims have been . identified tonight as James Ferrari, 59, of Montrose; Donna Smith, 54, . of Newburgh, and 35-year-old Ahn Kisook, of Queens. NTSB . spokesperson Earl Weener said investigators expect to be on the scene . 'a week to 10 days' investigating the cause of the deadly crash. The agency has already green-lit the use of a crane to upright the overturned train cars, Mr Weener said, adding that turning the locomotive over would stop further fuel from spilling. It is not clear how much fuel has spilled. Waiting game: People and an empty electronic display for the Hudson line are seen in Grand Central Station after a Metro-North train derailment in the Bronx . Silver lining: New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said that had the accident happened during the weekday, the death toll could have been higher . The investigators worked the site throughout the afternoon, but the investigation will begin Monday in earnest, Mr Weener explained, adding that speed is considered a factor. The NTSB will also look into Metro-North maintenance records after expressing earlier this year a concern over how well the train operator's equipment is maintained. Engineer William Rockefeller Jr, 46, has . claimed he tried to apply the brakes but they didn't work, according to . multiple reports. William Rockefeller Sr. defended his son to the Post, saying 'he’s one of the better engineers, the most dependable. And he really does like trains.' Four people were confirmed dead on the scene of the accident, officials said.They were all riding in the overturned cars. Three individuals were found dead outside the train, FDNY Commissioner Sal Cassano added. 'We believe that three of the four fatalities were thrown from the train,' Mr Cassano said. Metro North commuter trains do not have seat belts. All seven of the train cars and the locomotive jumped the . tracks just before the bend on the Hudson Line train, multiple cars are shown are their side, with one only inches . from the Harlem River's icy waters. 'It’s obviously a very tragic situation,' Governor Cuomo said, 'unfortunately there are four fatalities and 63 people are injured.’ Despite a train earlier this year derailing only feet from this incident, the governor dismissed the track itself being the problem. 'The curve has been here for many years, trains take the curve everyday… there has to be another factor.' President Barack Obama said in a statement issued by the White House that his thoughts and prayers are with the friends and families of the victims of the derailment. According to the statement, the president was briefed on the accident Sunday morning. The White House added that Obama will continue to stay in touch with New York officials throughout the day.

The cyclist shot dead in the Alps may have been the ‘main target’ of the massacre, French police say – not the British al-Hilli family. Investigators made the extraordinary claim as Sylvain Mollier, who worked in the nuclear industry, was ‘temporarily buried’ in a secret ceremony yesterday. This went against the wishes of the 45-year-old’s family, who had asked for him to be cremated. Crime scene: The bullet-riddled BMW where the bodies of Saad al-Hilli, his wife, Iqbal, and mother-in-law Suhaila Al-Allaf were discovered along with his daughters Zeena and Zainab . It is believed forensic experts still want to examine his body for clues, which would have been impossible if the remains had been destroyed. Just 30 people attended the funeral, . which took place at 6.30pm last night - a day when the burial site is normally closed. It was deliberately . kept hidden from the media, employees told French broadcaster RTL. French investigators are examining the theory that he may have led a ‘double life’ and been the intended target of the shooting. Until now the investigation had focused on the deaths of British aerospace engineer Saad al-Hilli, 50, his wife Ikbal, 47, and his mother-in-law Suhaila al-Allaf, 74, who were shot in the countryside near Annecy in their BMW estate car. Mr al-Hilli’s seven-year-old daughter Zainab was discovered badly beaten by a passing British cyclist shortly after the attack. Burial: Relatives of Sylvain Mollier at Ugine Funeral Home after police refused to allow them to cremate him as they continued their investigation . Her four-year-old sister, Zeena, was found unscathed hiding under her dead mother’s skirt eight hours later. The family, from Claygate, Surrey, had been camping near Lake Annecy when they were attacked. Victim: Saad al-Hilli, 50, the father murdered near the village of Chevaline, near Lake Annecy, in the Haute-Savoie region of France . It had been thought that Mr Mollier was killed because he witnessed the shootings as he cycled past. But Lt Colonel Benedict Vinnemann, who is leading the gendarme inquiry, revealed he was considering other possibilities. He said: ‘Was the al-Hilli family the main target? Was it not the cyclist? Only ongoing work on the scene can answer this question clearly. ‘We’re talking about someone whom everybody says was a gentleman, but who’s to say he did not lead a double life?’ Mr Mollier worked for Cezus, a subsidiary of the Areva Group, specialising in zirconium metalworking for nuclear fuel containers. Cezus is owned by the Areva group which in 2007 was forced to deny a report in Der Spiegel that it had flouted UN sanctions by providing Iran with enriched uranium. He lived in Ugine, close to the isolated beauty spot on the edge of the village of Chevaline where the shootings took place. He had two teenage boys from a previous marriage while his second wife, a pharmacist, gave birth in June. Mr Mollier was still on paternity leave and had been using his spare time to cycle around the countryside. He was identified after his partner, worried about not seeing him return, alerted the police. The two survivors, Zainab and Zeena, are back in Britain and are believed to have been reunited at a secret location near London. They are being closely protected, amid fears that whoever was responsible for the attack may try to harm them.","Sylvain Mollier worked in the nuclear industry, specialising in zirconium metal-working for nuclear reactors .

Sensitive cats have never been fans of loud noises, rapidly disappearing under the bed or table to escape the din. But now everyday sounds about the house like the clicking of a computer mouse, tapping a boiled egg or opening a can of cat food can trigger seizures in the animal, it has emerged. Vets are researching the phenomena after owners reported their pets' were behaving oddly to the popping of . pills from blister packs, the dropping of metal items on tiled floors . or ceramic bowls and the hammering of nails. Sensitive: Cats can get seizures from everyday house noises like the clicking of a computer mouse and even the opening of a tin of cat food . Even the noise of . owners slapping their foreheads or clicking their tongues has affected cats, the Sunday Telegraph reported. Researchers from University College London and a specialist veterinary centre are investigating anecdotal data sent to them by the charity International Cat Care (ICC). The animals' reaction is similar to reflex epilepsy in humans, believe experts who have appealed to owners let them carry out tests on their pets. They want to establish if there is any genetic link which makes some animals more prone and some sounds more likely to trigger a response. Comic scene: An affected cat ran around in circles before colliding with furniture in a phenomenon likened to Tom and Jerry cartoons . Mark Lowrie, from Davies Veterinary . Specialists, told the Telegraph: 'We want to see if other vets and owners are aware of . the problem. It could be they haven’t even associated these fits with . noise. A cat called Moochie had fits and lost balance caused by repetitious clicking or tapping sounds, its owner reported. Another cat called Jeffrey had seizures for about a minute caused by mouse clicks and the tapping of a boiled egg. Gracie reacted in a similar way to the sound of rustling paper. She ran around in circles and collided with furniture. 'I’m sure that a pattern will emerge. It doesn’t seem to be . occurring at times of stress. It is often when the cats are being fed – . which is probably one of their happier times of the day.' The researchers, who posted appeals on  the ICC's Cat Care Journal and in veterinary publications, believe it could lead to greater understanding of similar conditions in humans. Seizures suffered by the animals are . described as being similar to a fit, with the cats displaying a jerking . motion, the paper reported. Some of the cats freeze suddenly or are jumpy. They all recovered once the noise stopped and the seizure was over. The attacks are not triggered by the volume of the noise, according to the owners. Claire Bessant, chief executive of International Cat Care, told the paper: 'It is hard not to smile, because it does all sound rather Tom and Jerry [cartoon], but it would be very nice to get to the bottom of it. 'People seem to be getting around it, by making sure they tip toe around their animals and try to avoid making the noise.'","Owners report their pets behaving oddly to sounds in the house including opening a tin of cat food .

Martha Ann Lillard's crippling illness has made her a prisoner in her own home for the last 60 years. Paralyzed by polio at age five, the Oklahoma woman has spent most of her life encased in a 1940s respirator which breathes for her. But the 65-year-old couldn't imagine life any other way. Martha Ann Lillard, 65, has lived inside an iron lung like this one since she was five-years-old . 'Some people have said I’d rather die than leave my iron lung, and it . makes it sound like I’m not trying to be modern, and it’s not like that . at all,' she told NBC News. 'It . feels wonderful, actually, if you’re not breathing well. When I was first put into it, it was such a relief. It makes all the . difference when you’re not breathing.' Lillard has learned to live with her disease. She taught herself to walk again. While she can leave the 800-pound respirator, she prefers not to. Lillard lies on a goose down comforter inside a long metal cylinder in which she’s enclosed with an . airtight seal. Her neck and head sticks out of a foam . collar. There are switches inside to allow her to roll a tray-like cot in and out. She lives with her three beagles, and a housemate who helps care for her. She stays in touch with friends by phone and internet. Lillard owns her iron lung, which runs on a fan belt motor that friends help patch . together with car parts when it breaks. She said it's a better option than portable positive pressure ventilators which most polio survivors . use. They force air into the lungs, often through a tube in the . throat. 'If . I use the positive pressure vent, I’m not as well rested,' she said. Martha told MailOnline about her experience. 'I was paralyzed all over except my face.I was unconscious & turning blue when they put me in the lung. I was in it for six month in hospital, during which time I learned to breathe for 30 seconds and longer on my own. It was terrifying.W hen you can't breathe much, you can't talk, cry or make a sound. Doctors said I wouldn't ever be out of the lung or walk. I was determined to do both!' She says that after the time she spent in hospital she regained 25% of her breathing and after a year of work she learned to walk. 'I would love to not need any vent & would like not to have the weakening that comes with Post-Poilo Syndrome. I can't use other types of ventilators because of inflammation that comes with Polio. I could be more rested if I stayed in the lung full time. But I choose to be up as much as possible.Get the vaccine!' This undated photo shows a woman lying inside an iron lung . Lillard . considers herself an anomaly in a U.S. society that barely remembers . the scourge of polio - a viral infection of the spinal cord that mainly affected young children. But with reports polio has reared its ugly head in Syria and Cameroon, Lillard wants . to make sure that people never forget. 'I think the word is to get your child vaccinated. Why would we let somebody have to go back through that again?' she said. 'If my mother would have had the . opportunity to give me the vaccine, she would have done that.' Lillard was a kindergartner in 1953 when she woke up with a sore . throat that quickly progressed to poliovirus. The virus is transmitted through contaminated food and water. 'The night before I was paralyzed, the neighbor children ate out of the same bowl of pancake batter that I did,' Lillard said. 'They just had to pray that nobody got it.' The first known outbreak of polio in the U.S. was in 1894 in Vermont. In 1952, a record 57,628 cases of polio were reported in the U.S.","Martha Ann Lillard, 65, was paralyzed by polio at age five .

A British scientist has sparked anger by flying thousands of miles to Africa to do experiments on baboons that are banned in the UK. Harrowing pictures show the intelligent and sociable creatures peering out of bare wire cages, babies clinging to each other for comfort and adults having pieces of their brain removed on the operating table. In one distressing image, a newly-caught baby is suckling its mother as she is given an identification tattoo at the primate research centre in Kenya. Caged: A baby baboon clings to its mother as they gaze out of their wire enclosure at the research centre in Kenya . Experiments on baboons and other primates caught in the wild are banned in Britain due to concerns about the suffering involved in trapping and transporting them. But an undercover investigation by the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection has revealed that a Newcastle University scientist is flying to Nairobi to do work on baboons captured on the African plains. The campaign group has accused neuroscientist Stuart Baker of bypassing British law and sidestepping the high welfare standards required in Britain. Professor Baker says his work could lead to vital new treatments for stroke patients and provide insights into other brain conditions such as motor neurone disease and Alzheimer’s. Some 150,000 Britons suffer a stroke . each year and the condition is the biggest cause of severe disability, . with more than half of survivors left dependent on others for help with . day-to-day life. Professor . Baker freely admits the experiments wouldn’t be allowed in the UK but . says that the welfare concerns behind the British ban do not apply to . his work in Africa. Research: Neuroscientist Stuart Baker has been accused of bypassing British law . And he stresses that while animal welfare standards aren’t as high as they are here, they have improved greatly during his time there and that the centre is committed to making further changes. The row surrounds the Institute of Primate Research in Nairobi, which Professor Baker has visited six times in the past two and a half years to do research on baboons caught in the wild. He is interested in an area deep inside the brain called the reticular formation, which is critical in regaining movement after a stroke and, in particular, control of the hand and wrist, something that is needed for dressing and other everyday tasks key to independence. Some of his experiments, filmed secretly for the BUAV and funded by the British taxpayer, involve cutting out pieces of the animal’s brain, before using thin electrodes to stimulate the reticular formation. The experiments are done under anaesthesia. And, in line with welfare standards in the UK, the animals are put down before they wake up. But the researcher has been accused of exploiting a cheap and plentiful source of animals. Sarah Kite, the BUAV’s director of special projects, said: ‘If researchers respect the welfare standards of UK laboratories then they should not accept lower standards when using non-UK facilities. ‘It makes a mockery of UK law if researchers are able to just bypass policy and go overseas. ‘We are asking the Home Office to close this loophole and we are asking the Kenyan government to stop using wild-caught baboons. The research industry talks about transparency and openness, but this is a dark secret. Most people would be appalled to know that UK researchers are going overseas to do research that wouldn’t be allowed in this country.’ Photos taken at the institute earlier this year by the BUAV show baboons being kept in bare single cages, despite the creatures being highly sociable animals that live in groups of up to 150 in the wild. Video footage shows baboons pacing or circling in their cages. One, it is claimed, has been at the institute for 20 years. Professor Baker told the Daily Mail that one of his reasons for going to work at the IPR, which studies conditions from malaria to infertility, was to improve animal welfare standards. While almost all the baboons were kept in bare, single cages when he first went there, there have been big changes, including the building of large, split-level compounds with tree ‘climbing frames’.It is hoped that the single cages will be completely phased out before long. Sedated: The baboons, which are caught in the wild, are put down after brain experiments . He admitted that doing animal research in Britain was very expensive and said that going to Kenya allows use of the large number  of animals needed to advance  his work. However, he said that the reasons behind the ban on using wild-caught primates in the UK didn’t apply to his African experiments. This is because the creatures are caught humanely and are not being transported thousands of miles. In addition, far from being endangered, baboons are a pest and those used in his experiments would otherwise have been culled. Professor Baker said: ‘Once you go beyond the simple “you shouldn’t be using wild-caught animals”, I don’t think any of the reasons apply in this particular situation.’ He added that the part of the brain that is key to stroke recovery  is so hard to reach that his experiments could not be done in any other way. The professor said: ‘Stroke is a very important condition that affects large numbers of people in the UK. ‘We have got better and better at treating people with stroke. They don’t die from it but they are left with disability, and giving people an improved quality of life is really important.’ IPR director Tom Kariuki said it was ‘patronising’ and ‘insulting’ to suggest that the institute was not interested in animal welfare. He added: ‘I would admit that some of our old cages may not meet current standards for space and welfare but our strategy is to throw out the old and bring in the new.’ He added that the IPR’s work is approved by the Kenyan government and said: ‘The removal of abundant animals from the wild is both a species management issue as well as a source of animals for much-needed medical research on diseases that impose a high burden on Kenyans and globally.’ A spokesman for the BUAV said: ‘Baboons are sociable, sentient and intelligent animals with strong family bonds. ‘This terrible suffering and mutilation is not necessary to improve the lives of people.’","Neuroscientist Stuart Baker has been accused of bypassing British law .

Anyone who’s travelled on London’s Northern Line will know that it’s often cramped – and very hot. But now engineers have found an ingenious use for the excess subterranean heat that it generates. It’ll be captured and used to warm-up over 500 homes in the Islington area of the capital. Scroll down for video . Hot stuff: Engineers will be putting excess heat generated on the often cramped Northern Line to good use by piping it into hundreds of homes . The heat will be piped from a Northern Line vent into Islington Council’s innovative Bunhill Heat and Power heat network, which already supplies more than 700 homes in Islington with greener heating. The network has 1.4 miles of pipes which carry the heat to local housing estates and a leisure centre. Heat from the London Underground will be captured and added to this network. The heat network is currently fed by a Combined Heat and Power energy centre which produces both electricity and heat. In the same way that we use heat from a car engine to keep us warm when driving, the energy centre uses the heat created from producing electricity to help heat buildings and provide hot water. A Mayor of London source said the scheme will reduce their heating bills by 10 per cent. The Underground project - the first of its kind in Europe - is a partnership between Islington Council, the Mayor of London Boris Johnson, UK Power Networks and Transport for London. Mr Johnson hopes it will help him achieve his pledge to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 60 per cent and produce 25 per cent of London’s energy from local sources by by 2025. Matthew Pencharz, the Mayor of London’s Senior Advisor on Environment and Energy, said: ‘We need to do everything possible to create a more secure, cost-effective and sustainable heat and power supply for London. ‘By supporting locally sourced energy and heat networks which can reduce bills and lower carbon emissions, we can not only save money but also drive innovation, jobs and growth in this burgeoning sector.’ Pioneering: The project - the first of its kind in Europe - is a partnership between Islington Council, the Mayor of London Boris Johnson, UK Power Networks and Transport for London . Waste heat is on: This map shows the areas of London that produce the most excess warmth . Cllr Richard Watts, Leader of the Council, said: ‘The expanded Bunhill Heat Network will cut energy bills for hundreds more local people. With energy prices going up and up, it's vital we do what we can to cut bills. ‘It's all part of the Council's work to help people manage the rising cost of living. Last winter was one of the coldest for decades and record energy prices meant many families on fixed incomes spent it in misery, unsure whether to heat or eat.’ Martin Wilcox, head of future networks at UK Power Networks, said: ‘We are carrying out a feasibility project exploring the potential to capture waste heat from one of our high voltage electricity substations and use it to warm local homes for the first time. ‘If it is successful there could be potential to replicate this and increase access to low carbon, low cost energy in other parts of the capital because we have electricity substations dotted throughout London which keep the lights on for millions of homes and businesses.’","The heat will be piped into around 500 houses in the Islington area .

Victim: Paul DeWolf was found dead in his bedroom in a fraternity house in Ann Arbor, Michigan on July 24 . The unidentified man, who is not a suspect in the case, had bought the laptop off Craigslist, and he was able to provide details of the seller to police, according to the Detroit Free Press. Shaquille Jones, 21, and Joei Jordan, 20, . have been charged with the murder of Mr DeWolf, who had been living in . an Ann Arbor fraternity house set up to make life easier for students on . the grueling medical program. July 24 Medical student Paul DeWolf is found shot dead in his university apartment. Neighbors report a break in around the same time. July 25 Police say one of the suspect's, Jones, sold the stolen laptop to a third man for $200 . October 3 Apple receive alert from Find My Mac app that stolen device has been turned on. November 7 Police announce three arrests in the murder investigation. Police Detective Katie Nucci told a hearing earlier this month how the Find My Mac tracking device on the laptop helped find the suspects. The computer had been stolen from the living room of a neighboring property around the same time that police believe Mr DeWolf was killed, according to Detective Nucci's testimony. A roommate of the laptop owner was home alone at the time and recalled hearing someone downstairs but thought it was a fellow student. As well as the laptop, a wallet and purse was taken. When the laptop was turned on on October 3, Apple received an alert and contacted the police. The Find My Mac program allows laptop owners to track, lock and even send messages to the screens of their computers. The computer was traced to an address in Detroit, where its surprised new owner found himself being questioned. Trace: A tracking app on a stolen laptop, similar to the one pictured, helped police trace the suspected killers . 'I knew it was something more than a stolen laptop since Ann Arbor police came all the way here,' he told Detroit Free Press. The 30-year-old said he wasn't worried when he was being questioned because he knew he hadn't done anything wrong. Police discovered that the man who sold the laptop on Craigslist had bought it from Jordan for $200 on July 25 - the day after Mr DeWolf was murdered. A check of phone records found Jordan's cell phone had used a tower near the home where the laptop was stolen from. Jordan and Jones, who sometimes lived together, have been arraigned on murder and home invasion charges. They are being held without bond. Police have declined to discuss what role the laptop played in their investigation or how a third unidentified man is linked to the murder.

This is the heartstopping moment a huge weightlifting bar comes crashing down on a woman’s neck, sending her careering forward during a crosslifting session. The dramatic video of the failed weightlifting attempt continues to fuel controversy around the Crossfit exercise movement - once used only by police and the military - that is now popular among millions of men and women around the world. In the clip, published on LiveLeak, the woman lifts the bar but buckles under the weight as the bar slip from her hands and onto her neck.

It is unknown where in the world the accident occurred or the extent of the woman’s injuries. The CrossFit exercise phenomenon pioneered by coach Greg Glassman is a system of exercises, including Olympic-style weightlifting, rope-climbing and tyre-flipping, created 13 years ago and now used by thousands of gyms worldwide. The regime has sparked outrage in recent months after Lea-Ann Ellison, a 35-year-old mother from Los Angeles, posted pictures of herself weight-lifting at eight months pregnant. She suffered a barrage of abuse online after posting the pictures, declaring she wanted to be a ‘Hot Mom,’ exercising up until three days before the birth of her son on November 7.

Another mother criticised for continuing a tough fitness regime throughout her pregnancy was model Nell McAndrew, who was stunned at the backlash she received after competing in a gruelling marathon while 20 weeks pregnant.

Two detectives who dealt with a sex crime claim against Jimmy Savile in 2008 have been referred to the police watchdog. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said it has directed Sussex Police to refer the conduct of the pair over their handling of the alleged indecent assault. A woman came forward in March 2008 to claim that disgraced television presenter Savile assaulted her in a caravan in around 1970 when she was in her early 20s. The Independent Police Complaints Commission said it has directed Sussex Police to refer the conduct of two detectives over their handling of the alleged indecent assault by Jimmy Savile . This was referred to prosecutors with three other allegations against the performer received by Surrey Police, but in 2009 the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided no action could be taken. Earlier this year, the CPS criticised Sussex and Surrey police forces for being 'unjustifiably cautious' and failing to properly investigate the allegations. Alison Levitt QC found that 'had the police and prosecutors taken a different approach' prosecutions could have been possible in relation to three victims. The two officers were referred to as DS O and DC T in Ms Levitt's report, and came under fire for wrongly telling the alleged victim that her claims would need to be corroborated before any prosecution. Earlier this year, the CPS criticised Sussex and Surrey police forces for being 'unjustifiably cautious' and failing to properly investigate the allegations. She withdrew her support for police action because she feared she would struggle to find the information they said they needed, for example contact details for people she knew at the time. Ms Levitt said: 'Looking at the documents created in 2008 I found it difficult not to conclude that the officers had, even if unintentionally, dissuaded her from pursuing her allegation. 'Insofar as she was led to believe that ""corroboration"" was required before a prosecution could take place, this was wrong as a matter of law.' The woman told Ms Levitt that DC T had said court action would be difficult because Savile was a 'big celebrity', and that the officer told her the late DJ's wealth meant he would have top lawyers who would make 'mincemeat' of her. A spokesman for Sussex Police said: 'In February this year we received a request from the IPCC, seeking relevant documents and our view on the potential for any police misconduct investigation, in relation to the 2008 sexual offence allegation against the late Jimmy Savile. 'We sent a full response to the IPCC in March and received a letter from them on November 1 requiring us to record a misconduct matter in relation to both officers referred to, and to refer it back to the IPCC for their decision on how it should be investigated. 'We will comply with that requirement and work with the IPCC on any next steps.

Spanish officials were  compared to Zimbabwean dictator Robert Mugabe yesterday after they violated international law by opening a British diplomatic bag at the border with Gibraltar. The Foreign Office said last Friday’s incident, in which Guardia Civil officers stopped a courier travelling from the Rock into Spain, was ‘completely unacceptable’. It is not known what was in the bag or why police wanted to search it, something that has not happened since a diplomatic bag was opened in Zimbabwe 13 years ago. Motorists queuing at the border crossing between Spain and Gibraltar in September. The Foreign Office has demanded an explanation after a British diplomatic bag was opened and searched by Spanish Guardia Civil officers on the border with Gibraltar . Diplomatic bags, used to carry important and confidential correspondence, are inviolable. The Foreign Office condemned  the 'serious infringement' of the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. Ukip . MEP  William Dartmouth,  who represents the Rock in the European . Parliament, said: ‘The last time a British diplomatic bag was opened in . this way was by Mugabe’s Zimbabwe. ‘Is that really the company Madrid wishes to keep?’ Tensions have risen since July after Gibraltar dropped concrete blocks in its waters to create what is said was an artificial reef to encourage sea life to flourish in a marine reserve . The FCO spokesman said: 'There are long-established and internationally-accepted Articles concerning use of the diplomatic bag to which the FCO adheres. We expect other parties to the Convention, including EU and NATO allies, to do the same. 'We take very seriously any reported abuse of the protocol surrounding use of the diplomatic bag. We have asked the Spanish authorities to investigate what occurred and take action to ensure it does not happen again. 'As far as we are concerned there is no justification for this infringement of the UK’s rights under the Vienna Convention.' British Prime Minister David Cameron (right) with his Spanish counterpart Mariano Rajoy. Mr Cameron told the Spanish Government that the situation at Gibraltar's border was 'not acceptable' The sovereignty of Gibraltar is a major source of tension between the UK and Spain. Both in 1967 and 2002, the people of Gibraltar rejected proposals for Spanish sovereignty. Yet, despite this, Spain still asserts a claim to the territory. The tension began in 1704 when an Anglo-Dutch force captured Gibraltor from Spain during the war of the Spanish succession. The territory was then ceded to Britain under the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. Historically, it has proved to be an important base for the Royal Navy. Now, its economy is based on tourism, financial services and shipping. Under the 2006 constitution of Gibraltar, the territory governs its own affairs although defence and foreign relations are still the responsibility of the UK Government. Located on the southern end of the Iberian Peninsula, it is an area of 6.8 square kilometres. Tensions . have risen since July, when Gibraltar dropped concrete blocks in its . waters to create an artificial reef for sea life. The Spanish say it . prevented their fishermen from working. Madrid responded by imposing tighter border controls, leading to long delays at the frontier. Last week Spain instructed a state . research vessel to take water samples and survey the contested area . which it says effects Spanish fishermen. Earlier . this month, the Spanish ambassador was summoned to the Foreign Office . over what was said to be an unauthorised incursion into Gibraltarian . waters by a Spanish survey vessel. It . was the third time the Spanish ambassador had been publicly summoned . over the Gibraltar issue since the current Spanish government took . office in December 2011. The . Spanish Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Environment, Miguel . Arias Cañete, said on Monday that Spain would take the UK to the . European Court of Justice if the European Commission failed to take . action over the reef works. In August Britain sent ten warships, . including aircraft carrier Illustrious, to take part in military . exercises in British waters, with three ships, including HMS . Westminster, stopping at a base on the island. Royal Navy patrol boat HMS Sabre (pictured) intercepted a Spanish survey ship and asked it to leave British Gibraltar waters, but it refused. The Spanish ambassador has now been summoned to explain . Despite . the move following just days after Gibraltar's chief minister asked for . more ships, British officials said the exercise was routine. Britain was given Gibraltar in the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, but Spain has said it will never renounce its claim to sovereignty. British sources said Gibraltar suffered frequent illegal incursions into its waters by Spanish boats, including police and naval vessels. From December last year to April, officials recorded 176 illegal incursions by Spanish boats.","The incident took place on Friday after bag was transported into Spain .

William Thomas, 69, was told he had a harmless cyst on his arm when, actually, he had aggressive skin cancer . Doctors have been berated for wrongly diagnosing a patient’s cancerous tumour as a large, harmless cyst. William Thomas, 69, went to see his GP, Dr Juliana Hood, in Borth, Ceredigion, mid-Wales, in June 2012 with a lump on his arm - the same arm on which he’d had a cancer scare in 1995. He returned to the surgery nine weeks later and Dr Ian Hosker could find no record of his previous visit. Rather than make an urgent referral, the doctor diagnosed him with a ganglion - a . harmless lump filled with fluid - and gave him a standard referral to attend . the local hospital four weeks later. However, Mr Thomas knocked the lump, . which had grown to the size of an egg, while at work. When it didn't stop bleeding, he went to A&E, where he was diagnosed with a rare form of skin cancer. Mr Thomas, a builder, said: 'The . doctors at A&E said it was urgent and sent me to Gobowen hospital . the next day for a biopsy. After examining it, they had to do an . emergency operation to remove it.' The . lump was Merkel cell carcinoma, a very rare and aggressive form . of skin cancer. Its removal has left Mr Thomas barely able to work due . to loss of power and function in his right arm. His daughter, Mandy Daniel, said: 'The look on my dad’s face when they said it was a cancerous . tumour will never leave me - he was petrified. It’s been a horrific time . for the family.' After the family complained, the Public Service Ombudsman for Wales ruled that the doctors treating Mr Thomas were guilty of serious failings. Mr Thomas was awarded £750 compensation for the errors that led to a delay in his skin cancer diagnosis last year.

The BBC boss who pocketed a £1million golden goodbye insisted yesterday he had not been greedy. Mark Byford said the BBC wanted him to have the controversial pay-off, and he refused to hand it back. The former deputy director general said he had done nothing wrong even though the settlement, at the heart of a scandal over generous pay-offs to BBC executives, was nearly double what he was contractually entitled to. The former BBC deputy director-general, Mark Byford, has defended his near £1 million corporation pay off - denying that he had been 'greedy' Speaking publicly for the first time . since he was singled out in a devastating report into the scandal by a . spending watchdog, Mr Byford said the payment was ‘properly approved’. But the 55-year-old was criticised by . MPs who said his refusal to pay the money back showed the ‘shameless . culture of entitlement at the top of the BBC’. Speaking on Radio 5 Live’s Victoria Derbyshire show, Mr Byford sounded nervous as he defended his pay-off. Mark Thompson, Director General of the BBC, and Lord Patten, BBC Trust Chairman arrive to give evidence to the Leveson Inquiry in London. Thompson told the Public Accounts Committee that the pay-off to Mr Byford, who left in 2011, was needed so he would remain 'focused' on his job . ‘I absolutely don’t think that it was . greed on my part at all,’ he said. ‘I lost my job, I was made . redundant, I was given the terms I was given by the BBC. ‘I left when I was told to leave by . the BBC, and after 32 years of working there, where I was devoted to the . corporation, the last thing that I would ever think or feel was that I . would want to have greed [sic].’ Mr Byford’s pay-off was heavily criticised in the National Audit Office’s scathing report into the pay-off fiasco in July. When he left the BBC in 2011, he was . handed a £474,500 ‘contractual’ redundancy payment, a further £474,500 . ‘pay in lieu of notice’ and £73,000 for ‘accrued leave’ – holidays he . had not taken. Former BBC2 controller Roly Keating was given a £375,000 pay-off but returned the money after learning it had not been properly authorised . But the watchdog found he had worked . eight months of his 12-month notice period, meaning he was paid at least . £316,333 more than he was contractually owed. However, Mr Byford – who receives a . £163,400-a-year BBC pension and has spent his early retirement writing a . history book – defended the huge sum, saying it was what the BBC wanted . him to have. The BBC has faced repeated criticism over huge salaries for stars and payouts to managers beyond what their contracts demanded. It is thought stars like Graham Norton and Gary Lineker both earn about £1.5million a year at the BBC. Earlier . this year it emerged that the BBC had paid out £369million in golden . goodbyes over eight years, including £60million to senior managers. Severance . payments included £470,000 to former director general George Entwistle . after only 54 days in the job and £680,000 to ex-chief operating officer . Caroline Thomson. The National Audit Office said the . BBC paid £1.4 million more than it was contractually obliged to pay to . 22 senior managers in the three years to December 2012 and that it paid . £60 million to 401 senior managers over an eight-year period. Accepting it was ‘a lot of money’, he said: ‘I lost my job... I agreed to do what the BBC wanted.’ Mr Byford was repeatedly asked whether he would repay any of the money, but refused to answer directly. ‘It was properly approved, and it was . the terms I was given,’ he said. ‘In that context I absolutely think . I’ve done no wrong... I did what the BBC asked.’ Tory MP Steve Barclay, who sits on the Commons public accounts committee, criticised Mr Byford. He said: ‘At a time when many are . struggling to pay the licence fee, nothing better illustrates the . shameless culture of entitlement at the top of the BBC than the refusal . to hand back money he should never have been given.’ Mr Byford’s stance is in stark . contrast to that of his former colleague Roly Keating, who was praised . for repaying the £375,000 he received. Mr Keating, the former director of . archive content, learned his pay-off exceeded his contractual . entitlement only when the NAO branded it ‘seriously deficient’, and . immediately sent back a cheque. The BBC paid £369million to departing staff members over eight years, including £60million to senior managers. However, Lord Hall, the BBC’s new director general, has now introduced a £150,000 cap on severance payments.","Byford - whose salary was £475,000 - given £949,000 when made redundant .

Emergency medical services chief Armands Plorins said Sunday the chances of finding anyone alive were 'practically speaking, zero'. President Andris Berzins has demanded a swift and thorough investigation of what he said Saturday was the 'mass murder of defenceless people'. Police said Sunday that seven of 13 people who had earlier been reported missing remain unaccounted for. Part of the roof at the two-year old Maxima supermarket crashed down during peak shopping hours on Thursday. Firefighters walk past debris. They lost three colleagues in the collapse . The roof fell in Thursday evening as customers were doing after-work shopping.  Preliminary reports indicate the roof caved in due to either faulty construction or building work on the roof . A second collapse killed three firefighters who were among rescue teams already inside the building.

"By . James Salmon . PUBLISHED: . 16:17 EST, 29 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:17 EST, 29 November 2013 . The astonishing greed of bankers was laid bare last night as it was revealed their salaries soared by more than a third last year. While the rest of the nation coped with an unprecedented squeeze on incomes, City workers were enjoying the high life, with the top 2,700 taking home an average of £1.6million each. The figure – which makes Britain’s financial elite the highest paid in Europe – flies in the face of the banks’ repeated claims that they have scaled down enormous pay rewards in the wake of the financial crisis. Allegations: Last night there were claims the sector had learned nothing from the financial crash . Last night there were claims that the sector had learned nothing from the greatest financial crash for decades – a crisis that their own greed and incompetence was in part to blame for. The figures also follow a string of  scandals at the country’s lenders over mis-selling, failing to help struggling small businesses, and rigging lending rates. Campaigners said that while City salaries have soared, ordinary families are still facing the worst squeeze on household income in living memory. Average workers saw wages rise by a minuscule 0.8 per cent last year, well below the rate of inflation. But figures from City-based watchdog the European Banking Authority show that last year 2,714 ‘high earners’ received salary, bonus and pension packages worth at least £830,000. Soaring salaries: The average pay reward for workers in the City was £1.6million, up from £1.2million in 2011 . This is 12 times the number in any other EU country. The average pay reward was £1.6million, up from £1.2million in 2011. By contrast, there are just 212 euro-millionaire bankers in Germany, and their average pay was £1.3million, almost a fifth less than their counterparts in the UK. Deborah Hargreaves, chairman of campaign group the High Pay Centre, said the report made a mockery of the banks’ claims to have reined in lavish payouts. ‘This goes to prove that the idea that banks are cutting back is a lie,’ she said. ‘They claim they are showing restraint – but everyone else is suffering from cuts in living standards while bankers are living the high life.’ John Mann, the Labour MP and member of the Treasury Select Committee, said: ‘The banks are failing to lend and giving themselves staggering increases in pay. This is despite the fact that the reason they are doing well is because of quantitative easing – in other words taxpayers lending them money.’ The City watchdog has begun an industry-wide inquiry into banks’ lending to small businesses, after claims of ‘unscrupulous’ practices at Royal Bank of Scotland. The Financial Conduct Authority said it will look at claims that state-backed RBS forced some business customers into collapse to seize their assets. RBS denies the claims. The regulator said it will also write to other banks ‘seeking confirmation that they are satisfied they do not engage in any of the poor practices’. The Bank of England said net lending to business fell by £1.2billion in October – reversing a £714million rise in September. Dominic Hook of Unite said it showed that fictional Wall Street villian Gordon Gekko was ‘alive and well and living in the City of London’. The huge pay rises come despite bank bosses repeatedly insisting they have cleaned up their culture in an effort to win back the public’s trust. RBS chairman Sir Philip Hampton said last year: ‘Pay is falling in this industry and has been falling in recent years.’ And addressing shareholders at its annual general meeting earlier this year, Barclays chairman Sir David Walker said: ‘It is without question that in Barclays, and more widely in the banking industry, pay became excessive.’ But critics say the figures show that behind the scenes bankers are intent on carrying on paying themselves just as much as before the crisis, if not more. Experts said the generous increase in bonuses was partly fuelled by the Government’s money printing stimulus – quantitative easing – which has helped push up share prices. Bonuses are typically  paid partly in bank shares, which rose sharply last year. The six and seven-figure banker bonuses have also put the City on course for a showdown with Brussels because the awards breach strict limits on payouts which will be introduced next year. The highest earners in the UK have been  bagging bonuses averaging 3.7 times their basic salary. That is well above a new European Union-wide cap that will limit them to a maximum of one year’s annual salary, or an upper limit of two years’ salary if shareholders approve. Criticism: Jonn Mann, a Labour MP on the Treasury Select Committee (left), said bankers were giving themselves pay rises while taxpayers lent them money and RBS Chairman Sir Philip Hampton claimed last year that 'Pay is falling in this industry and has been falling in recent years' Despite public anger over boardroom greed, the Government has lodged a legal challenge against the EBA bonus cap with the European Court of Justice. It fears the banks will respond to a cap by pushing up basic pay for top staff. Banks have complained they will lose staff to non EU and US rivals which do not have similar pay restrictions if the bonus cap is introduced. Industry lobby groups defended the pay rises. Chris Cummings, chief executive of TheCityUK, said: ‘London is the world’s leading financial centre. That means we attract the best people around the world to the UK. It would be unfortunate if the City were to lose this mantle, because we’d lose the tax that companies and individuals pay.’","The figure make's Britain's financial elite the highest paid in Europe .

A 'sovereign citizen' who claimed an Ohio family's home while they visited a dying relative has filed deeds for another 11 properties. Ohio's Robert Carr applied for the 'quiet titles' after claiming the owners gave up their ownership rights when they left the property. 'When you abandon a property, bam, walk . away from it, ‘I ain’t never coming back. I don’t want nothing to do . with it’ right? Somebody can come in, ‘Oh mine',' he told WLWT. Scroll down for video . 'Sovereign citizen'; Robert Carr filed 'quiet titles' on 12 'abandoned' properties . Under new owners: This is just one of the $130,000 homes that Robert Carr has possessed under his 'sovereign' rights and used a 'quiet title' As a member of the sovereign citizens movement, Carr believes he can handpick which laws to follow. The movement is premised on the idea that current local, state, and federal governments are 'illegal' and have veered away from the founding fathers’ original intent. In relation to property, Carr claims home owners forfeit their ownership rights when they leave a property, even for a weekend. He doesn't expect to pay anything for the homes. A Springdale, Ohio family is currently challenging Carr's deed on their home, which they had owned for 21 years. The unidentified family say they were locked out of their own home after visiting relatives out-of-town. Carr showed them a document he filed with the County Court. Wreckless: The former family who used to live in this home say their lives have been turned upside down by Carrs' actions . 'What he's looking for is full title and ownership of the home,' the family's attorney, Alison Warner, said. 'He's in their home. They don't know when he's there. He can be there now.' The family say they feel violated. 'I'm very scared, you . know, because I never know if somebody's going to be here,' the . homeowner said. WLWT uncovered 11 other instances where Carr filed the same paperwork. Seven of the cases were filed on the same day. 'I have a team of people who go out and I say make sure the house is empty. If it's empty, change the locks,' Carr said. 'Anybody can do it.' Robert Carr went into the home, changed the . locks and emptied the house . Court documents: Carr has filed for ownership of a dozen 'abandoned' homes in . the area . Carr has been charged with breaking and entering in one case of disputed ownership, but he is fighting that charge. Quiet title actions are used to determine who legally holds the title to property, because real estate may sometimes change hands frequently, and the lawsuits can help remove clouds over claims of ownership. The anti-government 'sovereign citizens' movement has grown in recent years and is rooted in the anti-Semitic, anti-black and anti-tax Posse Comitatus movement of the 1970s and 1980s. Most recent recruits to the sovereign citizens movement found themselves in desperate situations, often due to the economy or foreclosure, and are drawn to the idea of easy money or living free of legal consequences. Sovereign citizens are becoming well-known by the courts for filing astronomical liens against banks, attorneys and government employees. While these are usually unsuccessful, they can be expensive to fight and take a long time to resolve. The FBI has been informed about the case but won't comment on the specifics.","Robert Carr has filed deeds for 12 homes he doesn't own .

Black smoke rose above gigantic fuel silos and darkened much of the sky. The pipeline owned by China's largest oil refiner, Sinopec, ruptured early Friday and leaked for about 15 minutes onto a street and into the sea before it was shut off. Hours later, as workers cleaned up the spill, the oil caught fire and exploded in two locations, the city government said. One eyewitness told Beijing News that he was driving past Qingdao's Huangdao . district when he felt the force of the blasts, and then realized the . ground had fractured. The air was pungent, many cars on . both sides of the road were overturned and there was dark smoke rising . in the distance, he said.

A statement from Sinopec said: 'We will investigate the incident with responsibility and give timely reports.' The Qingdao Environmental Protection Bureau said barriers had been set up to contain the oil as it spread into the sea, but a mixture of gas and oil from a storm sewer exploded and caught fire. More than 32,000sq ft of sea surface was contaminated, the city government said. Authorities said the oil had seeped into underground utility pipes, which could have been a factor in the blasts, but they did not elaborate. They assured the public that the explosions did not affect any petrochemical plant or military facilities in the seaside district and that air quality remained good after the disaster. The accident is likely to add to growing concerns among the Chinese public about safety and the environmental risks that come with oil pipeline projects.

Key documents about the murder of Alexander Litvinenko must stay secret, a court ruled yesterday. The coroner investigating the poisoning of the former KGB man in London seven years ago was set to make public a government dossier relating to the case. But yesterday three judges over-ruled him, saying releasing the information would cause ‘significant damage to national security’. The High Court decision is another blow to the campaign by Mr Litvinenko’s family to discover the truth about his murder. Secret documents: The government today won a legal battle to keep documents linked to the Alexander Litvinenko inquest secret . Last night his wife Marina said she feared the alleged role of the Russian state in his death might never be exposed. She is planning a legal challenge to force ministers to hold a full public inquiry – an option they ruled out earlier this year. Mr . Litvinenko was poisoned in 2006 by a radioactive substance, polonium . 210, after meeting two fellow former KGB agents at the Millennium Hotel . in Mayfair. He died three weeks later. The . two spies, Andrei Lugovoy and Dmitry Kovtun, both deny involvement and . Russia has refused to extradite them for questioning in the UK. Battle: The former KGB spy's widow Marina Litvinenko leaves the High Court after the hearing today where a court ruled documents should be kept secret . The . coroner, Sir Robert Owen, had argued that some of the material . ministers want to keep secret should be made public to ensure a ‘fair . and meaningful inquest’. But Government lawyers claimed the documents . were ‘sensitive to the highest degree’. Yesterday, . Lord Justice Goldring and two other judges at the High Court in London, . agreed. Lord Justice Goldring said he was ‘driven to the conclusion . that the weight the coroner gave’ to the Government’s view ‘was . insufficient and amounted to an error of law’. He . said the issues in the case ‘concerned the risk of significant damage . to national security’, adding ‘nothing we have decided reduces the . importance of open justice’. Through her lawyer, Ben Emmerson QC, Mrs Litvinenko said she was ‘disappointed but not surprised’ by the judgment..

Britain's potholed road network could be 'brought to its knees' by another spate of bad weather, council transport bosses warned today. They said swathes of local roads could become unusable if there was more flooding or another severe winter. The Local Government Association warned of a £10.5billion repairs backlog and a 'spiral of decline'. One in five roads is now classed as being in a 'poor condition'. Swathes of local roads could become unusable if there was more flooding or another severe winter, the Local Government Association has said . The LGA said: 'Further severe weather could now lead to a tipping point in many areas where roads will become so damaged they will have to close. 'Without extra government funding to pay for desperately needed resurfacing more severe weather could bring parts of the country to its knees.' The LGA said recent freezing weather and flooding has caused an estimated £1billion of damage throughout the country. Last year council highway teams fixed 2.2million potholes – 500,000 more than the year before – but despite these efforts the LGA said the backlog of repairs continues to grow. It said crumbling carriageways are costing small businesses £5billion a year and some local roads were at risk of closure. The LGA has written to Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander, asking him to provide more funding 'to turn around the spiralling decline'. Bad weather conditions have affectid roads around Britain and an increasing amount of pot-holes appear to be on the roads . Peter Box, chairman of the LGA's economy and transport board, said: 'The case for proper funding to resurface our roads is a no-brainer. 'The short-termist approach  of successive governments of underfunding local road maintenance, coupled with severe weather over recent years, has taken its toll. 'Now we're facing unprecedented budget cuts, things are only getting worse – something plain for all drivers to see.' He added: 'Despite their best efforts, many councils are trapped in a false economy of reactive repairs while managing a spiralling compensation bill, all the time praying it doesn't flood or freeze. 'Government cutting funding for roads is a very high-risk strategy as the longer you keep simply patching up a deteriorating surface, the more vulnerable it becomes to severe weather. 'Unless something changes, we risk swathes of Britain's road network becoming dangerously strewn with potholes or collapsing completely.' A recent AA survey revealed that across Britain motorists face an average of 6.25 potholes per mile. AA president Edmund King said: 'Although patching up the roads after last winter's ravages has brought some improvement, their condition is on a knife-edge and drivers are still likely to have to dodge potholes.' Transport Minister Norman Baker said the Government was providing councils with more than £3.4billion between 2011 to 2015 to maintain their highways. He said it was also working with the sector and sponsoring a £6million Highways Maintenance Efficiency Programme. A report by the RAC last week said a 'plague' of potholes combined with soaring petrol prices and motoring taxes meant Britain's drivers were at their most miserable for 25 years.","Local Government Association warns of 'spiral of decline'

A fugitive Briton wanted over a £1.5million fraud in South Africa has been found working as a teacher in the UK - after the police were tipped off by a pupil. Broker Mike Hale, 63, left Pietermaritzburg four years ago after 20million rand (£1.55million) went missing from his insurance firm. Authorities there put out a search warrant and contacted Interpol in a bid to track him down. But Mr Hale, a former captain of the Great Britain water polo team, arrived back in the UK and passed background checks to become a supply teacher in Cornwall. Accused Mike Hale denies any wrongdoing and says he left South Africa because of stress . The ex-sportsman was brought to the attention of the authorities when a school pupil read about his case on Facebook and recognised him. The 13-year-old girl posted details of her detective work online along with a picture she took of Mr Hale - and soon more students came forward to confirm the sighting. Among them was former Falmouth School student Daniel Templeton, who was taught PE by Mr Hale 18 months ago. He wrote: 'I thought, ""Oh my god, that's really him"". 'I just find it ridiculous. Surely he must have gone through the system?' Police in South Africa are now waiting to extradite Mr Hale who is no longer working as a teacher after Penryn College and Falmouth School informed the police about the developments. The ex-sportsman, pictured with his partner, went undetected for years but was finally exposed when a school pupil read about his case on Facebook and recognised him . The alleged conman left South Africa in 2009 after the money went missing from the accounts of his company MJCM Insurance Brokers in Pietermaritzburg. He is accused of 20 cases of fraud affecting 200 people, including his wife of 13 years and his brother-in-law. Mr Hale denies any wrongdoing and says he fled South Africa because of stress. He said: 'My attorneys are dealing with it. There were other people over there who were in the wrong, I’m not in the wrong. Mr Hale pictured on a web cam by a student at Penryn College. Police in South Africa are now waiting to extradite Mr Hale . 'I’m very upset about it. It’s a very difficult situation. I left because everything failed and I was stressed out.'

Priority Crime Investigation), confirmed: 'Mike Hale is a wanted man.' He added: 'We know where he is. And we are in touch with the UK authorities to try and extradite him. 'The matter is at a very sensitive stage. We have been doing the necessary paperwork so that he can come to South Africa to answer for the alleged wrongs he has done here. 'He was not put on the Interpol wanted list. But his name was circulated to Interpol and the movement control system. 'That’s how we know where he is.' Hale had worked at colleges and schools across Cornwall. A statement from Cornwall College said: 'He registered in September 2009, having completed all necessary statutory checks as a qualified teacher, including professional references. 'In line with the current Disclosure and Barring Service guidance and our normal operating policy, all checks were updated November 2012 - all were clear. 'We have no information relating to alleged activities in South Africa. Mr Hale is no longer working with us.' A statement from Penryn College said: 'As soon as Penryn College and Falmouth School were alerted of the allegations, both immediately informed the police and the supply agency of the allegations made about him.' Hale, originally from Walsall in the West Midlands, was one of Britain’s most successful water polo players, starting his career at Walsall Swimming and Water Polo Club and being made captain of the England U-18 team in 1964. At just 16 he was selected to play for the Great Britain senior squad in 1966, a team he went on to captain in 1970 when it was among the best in the world. He is now living in a converted farmstead and has pigs and sheep in sheds on the land.

The magical process of a large and colourful butterfly emerging from its pupa has been captured by a Spanish photographer. Artist Jimmy Hoffman, 52, who lives in Calonge in the north east corner of Spain, took a series of photographs of the step-by-step process at his home. After waiting patiently for five hours, the photographer captured the moment the two-tailed pasha butterfly emerged from its cocoon - from when its wings could just be seen peeping out of the chrysalis to when it finally became visible in all its glory. Scroll down for video . Spanish artist and photographer Jimmy Hoffman has captured the step-by-step process of a beautiful two-tailed pasha butterfly emerging from its pupa . The process of breaking free from its clear cocoon to spreading its wings for the first time, took the butterfly, which is commonly found in the Mediterranean, around 30 minutes. Mr Hoffman said: ‘After around two weeks the pupa was getting a darker colour as the wings and body of the butterfly shone through the transparent pupa-skin. ‘I knew that it was almost time for the butterfly to emerge. ‘You never can predict exactly when the process of emerging will start, so I had to wait the whole morning before it happened.’ The photographer had his camera set up and on standby and waited five hours for the creature to begin to emerge. Mr Hoffman waited five hours for the butterfly to emerge and first noticed its head and legs appearing, which were followed by its soft and shriveled wings before its body emerged. he said it did not look very beautiful at first . ‘First the head and legs appeared and then the soft and still tiny wings and eventually the whole body emerged,’ he said. ‘In the beginning the butterfly wasn't looking very beautiful with his shrivelled wings.’ Mr Hoffman said that for the first 10 minutes the insect tried to look for a good place to hold on to and decided to hang below the empty pupa skin. ‘Then it started to pump blood into the wing veins. You can see the wings grow and grow bigger and the beautiful patterns become visible,’ he said. ‘The whole process took a few hours and after that the butterfly had to wait until the wings were completely dry before it could fly away."" Mr Hoffman said he first came across the 'insect' when it was a caterpillar egg on Arbutus unedo, which is commonly known as a strawberry tree because of its red edible fruits. He spotted the tiny yellow-coloured eggs on the top side of the leaves on the evergreen shrub. The artist took the egg home and put it in a plastic container so he could track its transformation. The photographer said he first came across the butterfly when it was a caterpillar egg on a strawberry tree and then looked after the egg and caterpillar so he could watch it emerge into the magnificent butterfly . ‘This species of caterpillar only feeds from this food plant. I had to change the leaves every two days, because the caterpillars prefer fresh leaves’, he said. After a few weeks and after four or five moults, the caterpillar was fully grown, Mr Hoffman said. ‘Approximately five centimetres long, it was ready to moult for the last time and change into a beautiful jade-green pupa. ’Of course after the photography session I set the butterfly free so it could look for a partner and take care of offspring,’ he said. After breaking free, the insect spent around 10 minutes looking for a good place to hold on to and decided to hang below the empty pupa skin. It started to pump blood into its wing veins, which meant its wings grew in size and the patterns on them became visible. It took a few hours for the butterfly's new wings to completely dry so it could fly away .","A Spanish artist recorded the two-tailed pasha butterfly emerging from its pupa after waiting patiently for five hours .

Tie Rack is pulling out of Britain after its Italian owners decided to give up on the chain in the face of repeated losses, putting 200 jobs at risk. A closing-down sale is expected to begin on Wednesday, with some 44 stores due to disappear by the end of the year. Tie Rack's miniature stores have become a familiar fixture at train stations and airports since it was founded in 1981 by heel bar owner Roy Bishko. Glory days: An airport branch of Tie Rack is seen in 1999, when the store was booming . Vanish: Tie Rack is to close 44 stores on the high street following repeated losses. It will remain online . The explosion of office-based jobs in the City of London financial district helped it expand rapidly, reaching a peak of 450 stores during 1998. But competition from internet retailers, coupled with high costs, has hit sales hard, while fashions have changed. Ties, once de rigeur at business meetings, have become regarded as optional accessories, with even the Prime Minister appearing in open-necked shirts for some speeches and functions. Changing times: President George Bush senior, left, wears a special Tie Rack tie to promote East-West relation at a summit in 1989. Right, David Cameron and Barack Obama go without ties at a G8 conference this year . The latest accounts for the business show that it made a loss of £6.9million last year, after falling £7.4million into the red the previous year. Mounting losses are understood to have convinced the firm's Italian owner, the Fingen Group, to leave Britain altogether, retaining only the Tie Rack online brand. Discussions are understood to be ongoing about the possibility of Tie Rack maintaining some stores at airports. But the last of its UK shops is expected to close by the end of the year, while accountancy firm Grant Thornton is thought to be seeking a buyer for the overseas branch network. The firm's Rolling Luggage subsidiary will not be affected. A spokesman said: 'Following a period of prolonged decline in Tie Rack’s fortunes, it is with regret that we announce this closing down sale. Management are working with staff to provide support during this difficult time.' A HIGH STREET PHENOMENON, A ROYAL FAVOURITE, AND THE TIE THAT ENDED THE COLD WAR . While in recent years Tie Rack may have slumped to just another outlet before Duty Free, the company had an illustrious history that chimes with the boom years of the 1980s, saw the company dabble with royalty, and even take part in efforts to end the Cold War. But the retailer, which once boasted 450 outlets nationwide, had a humble beginning. According to Tie Rack's official history, the idea for a dedicated tie shop was born because its founder was fed up with the queue at Harrods. Roy Bishko, the South African who ran the company for most of its life, had long been a tie enthusiast, but said that quality silk versions were only affordable once a year when the Harrods sale rolled around. The rush for cheap ties, which he compared to 'being caught in a swarm of locusts', convinced him there was a market for 'silk ties at prices that would not make people cry'. Boom times: Shoppers queue outside Tie Rack on Boxing Day 2001 . Mr Bishko, who owned a shoe-servicing shop on Oxford Street, started selling ties as well, put on display draped over shoe racks. They sold out on the first day, and later that year the shop was transformed into the original Tie Rack. A year later, the first store opened in a train station at Waterloo, and in 1984 a Tie Rack outlet opened at Glasgow Airport, at a time when airports were nationalised and contained very few shops. Business boomed for years, cropping up in stations airports and high streets all over the country. In 1987 Mr Bishko decided to float the business on the stock market, to fund even more rapid expansion. When in the shares hit the market in June 1987, there was £1billion worth of applications for just £12.5million in shares. The huge level of interest - 84 buyers for every single share - was a record at the time. Royal attention: Princess Diana opened a Tie Rack store in 1987 . By the end of the year, the retailer had even caught the attention of the Royal Family. When Princess Diana was invited to open the St Anne's shopping centre in Harrow, north-west London, she took a moment to cut the ribbon of a new Tie Rack, commenting: 'I always like these shops. They have such smashing, cheerful colours.' She even gained a souvenir from the trip in the form of a pair of silk blue boxer shorts that shop staff noticed caught her eye. Though there is nothing to suggest Prince Charles ever donned that particular Tie Rack product, he made a point of complimenting their ties at a store opening in 1994 at the Louvre in Paris. Mr Bishko met the Prince at the store - punningly called The Art of Ties - and recalled him saying: 'You have an awfully large selection of ties here. Do you know, I would like to buy my ties myself but, of course, I can’t.' However, the retailer's greatest contribution to events on the world stage undoubtedly came in the dying days of the Cold War, when US President George Bush senior wore a symbolic Tie Rack number as he ended the long-running conflict between East and West. President Bush wore the historic 'Glasnost' tie on one of the days of the Malta Summit in 1989, which many consider the official end of hostilities between the United States and the Soviet Union. The design was launched a year earlier and sent to President Bush, his predecessor Ronald Reagen, and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, as well as a host of other prominent figures. The Glasnost tie, named after the Russian policy of increased openness to the West, featured the US and Soviet flags next to one another, and also sported a white dove, to symbolise peace. World stage: President George Bush senior, left, is seen wearing Tie Rack's Glasnost tie at the Malta Summit in December 1989 . As part of its drive for peace - and publicity - when Tie Rack sent out its Glasnost ties to celebrities, it asked them to send one of theirs in return. These were then auctioned off for charity, raising more than £100,000 after contributions from Bob Hope, Paul McCartney, Mick Jagger, Elton John, as well as two scarves from Margaret Thatcher. The brand peaked in the later 1990s, when it had more than 400 stores worldwide, but began to fall victim to changing styles and increased competition. In 1999, the group went private as Italian design house Frangi Designs bought up 70 per cent of the company's shares, while the other 30 per cent were retained by Mr Bishko and the company directors. Frangi were in turn bought up to become part of Italian conglomerate The Fingen Group, which owns Tie Rack today. By 2013 the once-ubiquitous chain had dwindled to just 44 shops, and today the news came that all but the 9 airport stores will definitely close, while even the remaining outlets hang in the balance.","Some 44 stores will disappear by end of the year following £6.9m losses .

Energy firms have been cleared of rigging gas prices after a year-long investigation. Electricity and gas watchdog Ofgem and City regulator the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said customers had not been ripped off by big firms. It means there is no respite for families facing price rises of up to 10 per cent this winter. Ruling: Energy and City watchdogs found that the wholesale market price for gas was not fixed by energy firms . A probe was launched into claims wholesale gas prices were fixed by power firms in September last year. It came after a whistleblower claimed the gas market had been ‘regularly’ manipulated by some big power companies - prompting concern that this could affect energy prices for households. The investigation focused on allegations that gas was sold at a lower-than-market price at around 4.30pm on September 28 last year, to manipulate the benchmark price in Britain used by the industry to influence a range of contracts. But Ofgem today said the unnamed sellers of the six lowball trades that day have given ‘credible’ explanations to ‘demonstrate that their trading activity was not improper.’ ‘No evidence was found which disputes the explanations provided,’ it said. Price hikes: Despite gas and electricity wholesale and operating costs remaining almost unchanged since autumn 2012, the Big Six companies have pushed through price hikes of up to 10% . Ofgem added: ‘It has been concluded that no evidence of the alleged market manipulation could be found and therefore that the interests of consumers have not been harmed. ‘Ofgem and the FCA always take seriously any allegation of market abuse in energy or financial markets and will consider carefully any evidence that is brought to our attention.’ The watchdog said its probe was detailed, complex and time-consuming and included information analysis and face-to-face meetings. Energy secretary Ed Davey said Ofgem and the FCA conducted a ‘rigorous review’. He added: ‘Market abuse is a very serious concern and I'm determined that where it exists, the full force of the law is brought to bear. ‘That's why we're introducing annual competition reviews to make sure the energy market is operating properly, and we're proposing to introduce criminal sanctions for manipulation of the energy markets.’ The price hikes will add £50 to every family's bill with some households seeing annual rises of more than £100 . Last month it emerged that profits made by energy firms on household bills have more than doubled in a year while the wholesale price they paid for gas and electricity remained almost unchanged. It fuelled suggestions that companies were ramping up prices to boost profits. Increases in what energy companies pay for gas and electricity added just £10 to household bills, but profit margins added £50 in a year. Four of the Big Six firms have already announced big price rises, with ScottishPower bills going up by 9 per cent, Npower announced a 10.4 per cent price hike, British Gas a 9.2 per cent rise and Scottish & Southern Energy an 8.2 per cent increase. The firms have variously blamed rising wholesale prices, bills for upgrading gas mains and electricity cables and extra green levies imposed by the government. But official figures released by Ofgem showed company profits had doubled in a year.","Ofgem and FCA say price was not manipulated after year-long inquiry .

An actress whose childhood was blighted by years of sexual abuse at the hands of a family friend has waived her right to anonymity in the hope it will encourage other victims to speak out. Rachel Isaac, who played Trudy in popular sitcom The Office and later acted on Broadway, yesterday chose to talk about the ordeal after finally seeing her abuser brought to justice. Michael Batten, 70, was jailed for 30 months after a judge said he had ‘brainwashed’ his young victim and that the abuse had ‘tainted’ her teenage years. Miss Isaac, 39, told how her mother . Jayne used to be best friends with Batten’s wife, Non. As a child she . affectionately referred to her as ‘Mam number two’, and she often . visited the Battens’ home. But . when Miss Isaac was only eight years old, Batten began molesting her. The abuse unfolded in ‘snatches’ of indecent exposure, touching and . molestation while his wife was hanging out the washing or walking the . dog. He went on . to target her dozens of times over a three-year period as she grew up in . the Welsh town of Maesteg. Yesterday Miss Isaac said: ‘After Batten . abused me, he would say, “You mustn’t tell anybody that we did that”. 'He . made me feel like I was complicit in what was taking place and also . threatened me that the police would come to take us both to jail if I . told anybody. ‘As a child I was taught that the police were there to protect us. It was so confusing.’ The . abuse ended when Miss Isaac began making excuses to avoid going to the . Battens’ home. But even then, the schoolgirl found that she was not free . of her tormentor. Batten . remained a regular visitor to her family home, and turned up with gifts . every Christmas Day until she left Maesteg for Cardiff when she turned . 18. Following her role in The Office in . 2002, in which she acted alongside Ricky Gervais, she went on to tour . the US in Greek tragedy Medea,  which ended up on Broadway. She . also won parts in television dramas such as Holby City and Casualty and . took other theatre work on both sides of the Atlantic. Sucess: The actress, circled, played Trudy in The Office alongside Ricky Gervais before acting on Broadway . But . her career ground to a halt in 2008 when she was struck down with what . would eventually be diagnosed as recurrent bouts of shingles and chronic . fatigue syndrome. The . following year the flashbacks, fretfulness and anxiety she had been . experiencing were diagnosed as post-traumatic stress disorder. Doctors . told her that the ordeal of sexual abuse was often a common precursor to . the condition. But the trial heard that it was not until ex-railwayman Batten approached her on a train in 2009 that Miss Isaac finally felt compelled to face up to what he had done. She wrote him a letter describing how she lived in a ‘constant state of fear’ and asking how it had felt to strip the underwear off a child who was ‘rigid’ with terror. Miss Isaac also contacted the sexual abuse charity One in Four, which arranged counselling. When she decided to take the matter to police this year, the charity contacted officers on her behalf. Jailed: Michael Batten, 70, was sentenced to 30 months in prison . In a five-page victim impact statement submitted to the judge, Miss Isaac said the abuse had left her ‘lost and cut-off from my emotions’ and had ‘altered who I am, who I should have become and how happy I may have been’. And she said her usually ‘strident’ mother ‘crumpled’ with horror when she finally revealed her ordeal in November last year. Batten faced a maximum of five years in jail when he arrived at Cardiff Crown Court for sentencing on Thursday. Judge Neil Bidder QC told the ‘pillar of the community’ that his reputation had been built on a lie. And he said Miss Isaac’s impact statement was ‘eloquent evidence of the very great harm’ Batten’s abuse had caused her. Batten, who has two grown-up children from two previous relationships, was convicted of three counts of indecent assault and one of indecency. He was sentenced to 30 months in jail. Following the hearing, the actress said she was ‘a little disappointed’ at the sentence.But she added: ‘The important thing is that Batten was found guilty, he’s been sent to prison and now everyone knows the truth.’ She went on to say: ‘Many people who hear stories of child abusers never really get a sense of who the victims are because they remain faceless and nameless. ‘Victims like me have often hidden these dreadful secrets for decades due to a sense of shame or fear or both. I realise now that it is only he who should be filled with shame. ‘I hope that by speaking out, it will encourage and empower other people to speak to their families and the police, and to feel confident that they will be believed and that they will be supported.’ And Miss Isaac stressed that victims who did not want to contact the police were not alone. She explained that there are ‘plenty’ of sources of support available, from GPs to counsellors and charities such as One in Four. She added: ‘Victims do not need to try and cope with what has happened to them on their own.’","Rachel Isaac played Trudy in the hit sitcom and later acted on Broadway .

Postal workers are refusing to deliver to a seaside cul-de-sac because they are coming under attack - from dive-bombing seagulls. Officials at Royal Mail said petrified postmen have been injured by the swooping birds, dive-bombing and pecking at their heads. It is thought the gulls are launching their aerial onslaughts to protect nests, and are being made even angrier by the postal workers’ brightly-coloured uniforms. Dive-bomb: A woman cowers under attack in Liskey Hill Crescent, Perranporth . Threatening: The attacks have become so vicious that Royal Mail has stopped delivering there . Blitz: The gulls are currently nesting and it is believed their aggression comes from protecting their young . Royal Mail has now ruled the gulls are a health and safety risk and have told residents at Liskey Hill Crescent, Perranporth, Cornwall, to collect their letters from a nearby post office. But homeowners say they have had to put up with the seagull blitz themselves for years and want mail staff to start delivering again. Jackie Bray, 67, who has lived on the crescent for 35 years, said: 'I’m waiting for a hip operation and now I have to go to the post office every day to collect my mail. 'It’s a service that we pay for, a service we are not getting. We have to put up with the seagulls so why can’t they? They should man up, buy a hard helmet and deal with it.' Ordinary cul-de-sac: Apart from the vicious seagulls Liskey Hill Crescent is just like any other quiet street . Royal Mail declared the street off-limits after a postwoman came under repeated attack from the birds. The gulls have pecked parents, children, dog walkers and builders but locals say nothing has ever been done about it. Long-time resident Eric Hardinge, 67, said: “In the past five years the seagulls have become more aggressive. 'They are protecting their chicks and attack people in packs, swooping down, targeting people’s heads. On the look out: The brightly-coloured uniforms of the Royal Mail could be making the gulls even more agitated . 'They go berserk when they see bright colours which is why I think they’ve gone for the postwoman because she wears red. 'The chicks will disappear but it is an on-going problem. The birds need to be culled.' Stuart Little, who has Parkinson’s disease, said he is not able to collect his own post. He said: 'I can’t walk very far. I understand the reasons for stopping the service but it’s very inconvenient. I think the gulls need to be controlled, they’re a pest.' In a letter to residents delivery office manager Andy Blight said the service would resume once the chicks have moved on or if they are removed by an authorised person. Plagued: Royal Mail say the deliveries will only resume once the gulls and their chicks have left . Royal Mail apologised to customers but said the seagull attacks mean postmen were facing a serious risk of injury. Spokeswoman Val Bodden said: 'The safety of our people is paramount and these swooping attacks have made it difficult for her to continue to do her job. 'These kinds of attacks do occur at this time of year across the country, as gulls are nesting. 'We apologise to those customers affected and we will resume deliveries as soon as it is safe for us to do so. We are continuing to monitor the situation.' Pests: The residents say they have to put up with the attacks every year . Last year Royal Mail suspended deliveries to one suburban cul-de-sac in Chippenham, Wiltshire, because of a flea infestation. Colleagues refused to deliver to another street in Bournemouth, Dorset, last May after complaining it was overrun with midges from a water treatment plant. And just last week postmen were told not to deliver to homes in Market Drayton, Shropshire, over fears they could injure themselves on his 'aggressive' raspberry bush.","Seagulls are viciously swopping down on Liskey Hill Crescent residents .

The 'world's oldest public toilet' has been discovered in Argentina - and scientists claim dinosaurs used enormous piles of faeces to scare away predators. The 240-million-year-old 'communal latrine' contained thousands of fossilised stools, known as coprolites, from the Dinodontosaurus, one of the largest herbivores of the Triassic era and similar to modern rhinos. It was found in the La Rioja Province in north-west Argentina and predates the former earliest megaherbivore communal latrine by 20 million years. Scroll down for video . Prehistoric latrines: The fossilised faeces, called coprolites, were found in dense formations and have been called the world's oldest public toilet . The stools are believed to have been produced by Dinodontosaurus, one of the largest herbivores of the Triassic era and similar to modern rhinos . There are two reasons for the communal toilets - hygiene and warning potential predators to stay away, according to Scientific Reports. Dr Lucas Fiorelli, of Crilar-Conicet, who discovered the dung heaps, told the BBC: 'Firstly, it was important to avoid parasites - ""you don't poo where you eat"", as the saying goes. 'But it's also a warning to predators. If you leave a huge pile, you are saying: ""Hey! We are a big herd. Watch out!""' A selection of coprolites, demonstrating their various shapes and sizes, which shows they came from a herd of beasts . The evidence also bolsters the hypothesis that Dinodontosaurus were sociable creatures. An estimated 30,000 coprolites are spread across the area, with a density of up to 94 coprolites per square metre. The largest of them weigh several kilogrammes and reach lengths of up to 35cm. The variation in size and shapes, ranging from tiny nuggets to long and thin, suggest they belong to several different herbivores of varying ages. They are a rich store of new information about the ecology of ancient ecosystems as latrines like this are extremely rare because faeces decomposes so quickly. Dr Fiorelli said a sheet of volcanic ash has preserved the ancient dung piles 'like Pompeii'. Martin Hechenleitner, another author on the study, says they contain clues, on now-extinct plants, fungi, and parasites at a vital point in the history of evolution. He said: 'This was a crucial time in evolutionary history. The first mammals were there, living alongside the grandfather of dinosaurs. 'Maybe with these fossils we can glimpse into the lost environment which gave rise to the dinosaurs.'

The primary school pupil drew the picture of barmaid Maria Jiminez's house as part of a series of pictures of events in her life - others featured herself as a baby, her pet dog, and her mother's new car. 'Gangs and loud music': The child's drawing that was used as evidence in the fight to have Maria Jiminez evicted . Neighbours said Jiminez, who lived in the house on the right, held all-night parties that often ended in fighting . The child's teacher asked her about the drawing of new home and the house next door with a red scribble through it, and was shocked when the girl told her about large groups of people gathering at the house and rowdy behaviour. The teacher was so concerned she brought it up with her mother at a parent-teacher evening. That sparked an 11-month campaign to get Jiminez, 45, and her two sons kicked out of her rented semi-detached in Moston, Manchester. Today residents in the street spoke of their relief after Jiminez and her two sons were ordered to leave the property after the child's drawing was used in evidence. Louise Thomas, 37, who moved into the street in May 2011, said the family's behaviour made life 'unbearable' for her family. She said: 'We moved in on the Thursday and that Saturday there was music and loud banging until 5am. Noisy: Maria Jiminez, right, has been evicted after a hearing in which a child's drawing was used as evidence . 'They used to cut through gardens, urinate in our gardens, shout abuse up at the house and at my kids, jump on our cars, it was horrendous. 'My children were having to sleep in earmuffs and I think it's important to stand up to people like that.' Jiminez who is thought to have moved into the property in 2006, held a string of wild parties despite repeated warnings by her landlords about her unruly household. Neighbours were kept awake by all-night parties, which often ended with fighting in the street. Children living near the property had to stack pillows against the walls to muffle the noise, and wear earmuffs so they could sleep. Another neighbour who asked not to be . named said: 'Living near them was an absolute nightmare. I lived on the . street since 1985 but I think they must have moved in about 10 years . ago. 'They were okay at first but soon . after there was just trouble. They would have all sorts of fancy cars . parked up outside at all hours and there were all sorts going in and . out of the house. 'The . area has gone downhill because of that family. They are very cocky and the general ambiance with them there was horrible.' 'Heart-breaking': The child drew her noisy neighbours alongside pictures of her as a baby and her pet dog . Jiminez was first taken to court by . officers from Northwards Housing in December 2012 and was served an . injunction demanding she stop the noise. When it continued, officers started legal proceedings for an eviction. In . August this year, Jiminez was handed a suspended possession order, . which meant that she could be evicted if the nuisance continued. But the order was breached within a month, so officers went back to court to apply for a warrant to evict her. The warrant to kick her out of the house was issued at Manchester Civil Justice Centre last Wednesday. Northward Housing's Mike Stevens said: 'Our quick-thinking officers were able to take legal action by using this heart-breaking drawing as evidence and we are delighted that the courts were able to act to rid this neighbourhood of such a selfish and anti-social character.'","The primary school pupil drew her noisy neighbours for a school project .

Jedi, druid and pagan weddings could be made legal across Britain under proposals from MPs, it was claimed last night. They want to change the law to allow humanist weddings, for couples who do not want a religious or civil marriage to express their commitment. But Tories say such an amendment would ‘dilute’ the institution of marriage by allowing other ‘ridiculous’ sects to marry couples. Tories fear pagan marriage ceremonies like this one in Glastonbury could undermine the principle of marriage if they are legalised . In Scotland, where humanist weddings have been legal since 2005, marriages have also been solemnized by the Spiritualists National Union, the Pagan Federation and a faith healing group called the White Eagle Lodge. Humanism, which has around 40,000 followers in Britain, is based on ‘reason and humanity’ rather than religious belief. In Scotland there were 2,400 humanist weddings last year, outnumbering Catholic ceremonies. Its practitioners carry out around 600 wedding ceremonies a year in England and Wales, but these have no legal force so the couples who have them must also be married by a registrar. MPs are trying to amend the same sex marriage bill, the controversial legislation to allow gay weddings, to allow humanist weddings to have legal force too. It will be voted on next week. But government sources say if they are empowered to carry out marriages, it will be impossible to stop other sects going to court to claim the same power on the grounds of discrimination. A government source said: ‘Marriage is hugely important and binds families and society together. We believe allowing same-sex couples to tie the knot will strengthen marriage by making it more relevant in modern society. ‘But proposals such as this which seek to undermine and dilute the institution of marriage by creating a two-tiered system are ridiculous. We have a fundamentally different marriage system to the one in Scotland and while they may be open to pagans, spiritualists and Jedi’s conducting marriages, we are not. The 2011 Census registered 175,000 Jedi Knights - inspired by the Star Wars films . ‘In Scotland there have already been pagan marriages, white eagle lodge marriages and the spiritualist union. We would not be able to justify making special provision for the humanists and not for other belief organisations, as it would be open to legal challenge.’ The 2011 census listed more than 175,000 Jedi Knights – the most popular choice of ‘Other Religion’. There were 56,620 pagans in the UK. 2,418 Scientologists, 1,893 Satanists. 11,766 followers of Wicca, and 4,189 druids. Andrew Copson, of the British Humanist Association, said: ‘The amendment will give legal recognition to humanist weddings, and it refers specifically to humanists, there is no way any other group will be able to carry out marriages as a result of it. It is uncontroversial and it is just scaremongering by the government to try and link it to Jedis. (pls keep). ‘Hundreds of couples have humanist wedding ceremonies every year and they are legally binding in Scotland, the Republic of Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Belgium, Norway and parts of the US without any unintended consequences. They satisfy a very obvious need for a dignified and meaningful ceremony which is not religious.’ There are around 100 humanist ‘celebrants’ operating in Britain who have been trained to carry out weddings. Couples are encouraged to not only to pen their own vows, but the whole service. Lib Dem MP Stephen Williams has told MPs that humanists carry out more weddings in England and Wales than the Quakers or Unitarians, and the proposals would give them the same legal footing as Jews and Quakers which can marry couples anywhere, not just in a designated building. He said: ‘The big difference is that they do not have legal force which mean that people who have had a humanist wedding and enjoyed their special day together in front of family and friends subsequently have to attend the registry office and go through another ceremony…or they have no legal protection.’","Amendment would allow 'ridiculous' sects to marry couples .

It's long been thought that humans evolved by looking out for themselves and making selfish decisions, yet it appears this evolution theory may have taken a turn as scientists discover being generous and working as a team is now the only way we can survive. Being selfish in the short term may garner the best immediate results, but selfish people will end up being less successful over time compared to their more generous counterparts, claims a new study. By applying the Prisoner's . Dilemma theory - usually played with two people in which they are . asked to incriminate each other to escape punishment - to populations, researchers from Pennsylvania found that cooperation evolved because being generous breeds success for all. This is because when the dilemma is played in pairs, being selfish guarantees the person making the decision the best possible outcome, yet, over time, being selfish to someone will eventually cause that person to be selfish in return meaning the initial successes are undone and no one wins. Researchers from Pennsylvania claim that teamwork, seen in insects such as the leafcutter ants pictured, evolved because being generous makes groups as a whole more successful. This only works when generous people also forgive selfish people and don't seek revenge . Researchers used the Prisoner's Dilemma . game to study cooperation where two people who have committed a crime . are arrested and each are offered a deal by police. The premise is, grass on your friend . and go free while the friend spends six months in jail. If . both prisoners grass, they both get three months in jail. If they both . stay silent, they both get one month in jail for a lesser offence. If . the two prisoners get a chance to talk to each other, they can . establish trust and are usually more likely to cooperate because then . both of them only spend one month in jail. But if they're not allowed to . talk, the best strategy is to grass because it guarantees you don't get . the longer jail term. The game allows scientists to study a . basic question faced by individuals competing for limited resources - do . I act selfishly or do I cooperate? They add that when everyone cooperates and is generous, that generosity spreads and everyone succeeds eventually, even if they have to make sacrifices. The study continues that this also needs to be coupled with forgiveness, meaning if someone has been wronged they should not seek revenge but instead show generosity in return. Researchers Alexander J. Stewart and Joshua B. Plotkin from Pennsylvania's Department . of Biology in the School of Arts and Sciences, examined the outcome of . the Prisoner's Dilemma when played repeatedly by a large, evolving group . of players. While other . researchers have previously suggested that being cooperative can be . successful, Stewart and Plotkin offer 'mathematical . proof' that the only strategies that succeed in the long term are . generous ones. 'Ever . since Darwin,' said Plotkin, 'Biologists have been puzzled about why . there is so much apparent cooperation, and even flat-out generosity and . altruism, in nature. 'The . literature on game theory has worked to explain why generosity arises. Our paper provides such an explanation for why we see so much generosity . in front of us.' According to . Plotkin, in 2012, Press and Dyson 'shocked the world of game theory' by . identifying a group of strategies for playing this version of the game. They called this . class of approaches 'zero determinant' strategies because the score of . one player is directly related to the other. They also focused on a range of zero determinant approaches they called extortion strategies. If . a player taking part in a so-called extortion strategy - in which they extort the situation for their personal game - against an . unwitting opponent, that player could force the opponent into getting a . lower score, or losing out. Being selfish in the short term guarantees the best possible immediate outcome, yet, over time, being selfish to someone will eventually cause that person to be selfish in return meaning the initial successes are undone and no-one wins. This then affects the overall success of a group . Instead . of a head-to-head competition, Stewart and Plotkin applied this to a population of people . playing against one another, to mimic what might happen in a human or . animal society in nature. In their version of the game, the most successful players would get to have more offspring, therefore . passing on their strategies to the next generation of players. During . research, Stewart and Plotkin found that the extortion strategies . wouldn't do well if played within a large, evolving population because . an extortion strategy doesn't succeed when played against itself. Study used the Prisoner's Dilemma in which a person is offered the chance to walk away free if they incriminate someone else . 'The . fact that there are extortion strategies immediately suggests that, at . the other end of the scale, there might also be generous strategies,' said Stewart. 'You . might think being generous would be a stupid thing to do, and it is if . there are only two players in the game, but, if there are many players . and they all play generously, they all benefit from each other's . generosity. 'In generous . strategies . players tend to cooperate with their opponents more, but, if they don't, . they suffer more than their opponents do over the long term. The . continued that 'forgiveness' is also a feature of these strategies - a . player who encounters a defector may punish the defector a bit but after . a time may cooperate with the defector again. After . simulating how some generous strategies would play out in an evolving . population, he and Plotkin crafted a mathematical formula proving that, . not only can generous strategies work best in the population version of . the Prisoner's Dilemma, these are the only approaches that resist . defectors over the long term. 'Our . paper shows that no selfish strategies will succeed in evolution,' Plotkin said. 'The only strategies that are evolutionarily robust are . generous ones.' The . discovery, while abstract, helps explain the presence of generosity in . nature, an inclination that can sometimes seem to go against the . Darwinian notion of survival of the fittest. 'When . people act generously they feel it is almost instinctual, and indeed a . large literature in evolutionary psychology shows that people derive . happiness from being generous,' Plotkin said. 'It's . not just in humans. Of course social insects behave this way, but even . bacteria and viruses share gene products and behave in ways that can't . be described as anything but generous.' 'We . find that in evolution, a population that encourages cooperation does . well,' Stewart said. 'To maintain cooperation over the long term, it is . best to be generous.' The findings were reported in the PNAS journal.","Researchers applied Prisoner's Dilemma theory to populations .

For months, all eyes in the sky have pointed at the comet that's zooming toward a blisteringly close encounter with the sun. And now NASA has released a high resolution image of the streaking comet that look like a swimming tadpole. It was captured by the H-1 camera on board NASA's Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory on November 21. Scroll down to watch the video . Appearance: Comet ISON entered the view of NASA's Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory on Nov. 21, 2013, where it can be seen with Earth, Mercury and comet 2P/Encke . The comet ISON shows up clearly, appearing to still be intact, reported NASA. Officially labeled as Comet C/2012 S1, ISON can be seen in these images along with Earth, Mercury and Comet 2P/Encke. The tails streaking out from behind both comets can be seen moving along with the steady stream of particles – called the solar wind – that flows out from the sun. The moment of truth comes Thursday when the sun-grazing Comet ISON, now thought to be less than a mile (1.6 kilometers) wide, will either fry and shatter, victim of the sun's incredible power, or endure and quite possibly put on one fabulous celestial show. Streaking: . Comet ISON (left) appeared in the higher-resolution HI-1 camera on . NASA's STEREO-A spacecraft. Dark 'clouds' coming from the right are more . dense areas in the solar wind, causing ripples in Comet Encke's tail . Solar wind: The tails streaking out from behind both comets can be seen moving along with the steady stream of particles ¿ called the solar wind ¿ that flows out from the sun . Should . it survive, ISON, pronounced EYE'-sahn, would be visible with the naked . eye through December, at least from the Northern Hemisphere. Discernible at times in November with ordinary binoculars and . occasionally even just the naked eye, it already has dazzled observers . and is considered the most scrutinized comet ever by NASA. But the best . is, potentially, yet to come. Detected just over a year ago, the . comet is passing through the inner solar system for the first time. Still fresh, this comet is thought to bear the pristine matter of the . beginning of our solar system. It's . believed to be straight from the Oort cloud on the fringes of the solar . system, home to countless icy bodies, most notably the frozen balls of . dust and gas in orbit around the sun known as comets. For . whatever reason, ISON was propelled out of this cloud and drawn toward . the heart of the solar system by the sun's intense gravitational pull. The closer the comet gets to the sun, the faster it gets. In January, it was clocked at 40,000 mph (64,000 kph). A composite image from the European Southern Observatory's TRAPPIST telescope in Chile shows Comet ISON streaking toward the sun on Nov. 15. The image combines four different 30-second exposures of the moving comet in different wavelengths . By last Thursday, with just a week to go, it had accelerated to 150,000 mph (240,000 kph). On Thursday, the comet will zip within 730,000 miles (1,175,000 kilometers) of the sun, less than the actual solar diameter. In other words, another sun wouldn't fit in the missed distance. By the time ISON slingshots around the sun, it will be moving at a mind-boggling 828,000 mph (1,332,000 kph). Whether it survives or is torn apart, earthlings have nothing to fear. The place to see the ‘comet of the century’ is in a clear dark sky where the horizon is unobstructed, such as in the countryside. It can be seen with the naked eye, but binoculars will highlight details such as its tail, streamers and bumps in the surface. The comet is currently close enough to the sun that, tomorrow, it will close to sunrise before its head appears on the horizon. By the end of the November, it should be seen before dawn in the eastern sky. On 28th of November, Ison will pass within 1.2 million miles of the sun’s surface before skirting around to where . The comet will venture no closer to us than about 40 million miles (64 million kilometers), less than half the distance between Earth and the sun. That closest approach to Earth will occur Dec. 26. Then it will head away in the opposite direction forever, given its anticipated trajectory once it flies by the sun. ISON is named after the International Scientific Optical Network, used by a pair of Russian astronomers to detect the comet in September 2012. But it officially is known as C/2012 S1, a designation indicating when it was discovered. Take heart: The 'C' means it is not expected here again. NASA wasted no time jumping on ISON. The space agency's Deep Impact spacecraft observed ISON back in January from a distance of about 500 million miles (800 million kilometers). Since then, the observations have stacked up. Among NASA's space telescopes taking a look: Swift, Hubble, Spitzer, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, Solar and Heliospheric Observatory or SOHO, Chandra, Mercury-orbiting Messenger, and the Stereo twin spacecraft. 'Every spacecraft that has a camera, we're turning on it,' said John Grunsfeld, NASA's science mission director. The comet, top right, has so far been photographed through telescopes and long exposures but is expected to be visible to the naked eye throughout December and January. It could be the brightest for 100 years . The newly launched Maven spacecraft en route to Mars will gaze at ISON the second week of December, once its ultraviolet instrument is up and running. 'That's well after closest approach to the sun,' the University of Colorado's Nick Schneider, who's in charge of the instrument, said in an email. So it's not known 'whether we'll see a comet, comet bits or the last wisps of comet vapor.' Whatever happens, it's bound to be interesting. The quip from my colleagues is, `Comets are like cats: They have tails and do whatever they want.'' Besides ISON, NASA is spying on Comet Siding Spring, another Oort cloud comet discovered in January by the Australian observatory of the same name. Siding Spring will pass within tens of thousands of miles of Mars next October, so close that scientists believe the coma of the comet - its thin but expansive atmosphere - will envelop the red planet. Supercomet: ISON could prove brighter than Hale-Bopp, pictured, which lit up the skies in 1997 . 'It will be blanketed in water and dust and meteorites. It moves like 50 kilometers per second, blazing through the environment,' said Jim Green, director of NASA's planetary science division. That's more than 110,000 mph, (177,000 kph) so the comet will be gone from Mars 'pretty quick.' Siding Spring-type events have happened before, Green noted. 'We're just lucky in our lifetime' to have the right spacecraft in the right place to observe the spectacle. The same applies to ISON. Add small sounding rockets to the list of paparazzi chasing the comet; NASA fired up one from New Mexico on Wednesday with an ultraviolet telescope that reached 172 miles (277 kilometers) high before descending by parachute. Consider all the ground observatories peering at the comet, as well as countless amateur astronomers and astrophotographers, and ISON has become the belle of the cosmic ball. 'Comets evolve from the time they start brightening until they go all the way around the sun, and go back out,' Green said. 'By having and leveraging these assets, it really gives us that view - that unique view - that we couldn't get otherwise.' Some sky gazers speculated early on that ISON might become the comet of the century because of its brightness, although expectations have dimmed over the past year. Scientists expect to know ISON's fate fairly quickly. At least three spacecraft will be aiming that way in real time. If ISON survives, 'it's going to fly right over the Northern Hemisphere,' Green said with clear excitement in his voice. It should be visible with the naked eye for 30 days. 'So it's really a holiday comet. You ought to be able to see it well past Christmas,' Green said. 'But it's got to survive it, that's the only thing about that.'","Images from H-1 camera on NASA's Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory .

Producers of an upcoming film starring actor Paul Walker, who died tragically in a fiery California car crash Saturday, say they’re sticking to the planned release date of December 13. The drama focused on Hurricane Katrina is called Hours and sees Walker taken a decidedly more serious turn that producers say makes it all the more important for the film to go forward. ‘After lots of back and forth, this is our decision. It's Paul's tour de force. He's in every frame of the movie,’ said Paul Presburger, CEO of Pantelion Films. Scroll down for video... Show will go on: Here, the late actor Paul Walker is seen in a still from his upcoming film Hours, about the tragedy of Hurricane Katrina. Producers have announced they'll proceed with the planned December 13 release of the film despite its star's death Saturday in a fiery car crash . The Hollywood Reporter points out that the film’s subject matter may have been one of great personal interest to Walker. The 40-year-old father of one had a charity he founded in 2010 in the aftermath of the devastating earthquake in Haiti. And his own tragedy came during a Santa Clarita, California charity function on Saturday for those affected by the recent typhoon in the Philippines. ‘Hours embodies a message that was so important to him, which is that you have to do everything you can to keep friends and family safe,’ producer Peter Safran told the Hollywood Reporter. The film also stars Genesis Rodriguez as the wife of Walker's character. Their child is born tragically sick during the chaos of Hurricane Katrina . 'He was looking for something to showcase his acting skills': Producers said the film was a passion project for Walker and that he would have wanted it released . 'Important to him': Producer Peter Safran said the subject matter was Walker's personal passion. The actor died Saturday during a charity event for victims of the recent typhoon in the Philippines . Walker was killed when the 2005 Porsche Carrera GT he was in with his friend and former race car driver Roger Rodas, 38, went out of control and smashed into a tree. Images from the resulting fire and its aftermath appeared unsurvivable. Police said speed was likely a factor in the crash. Now, audiences in 15 select U.S. cities and video on demand viewers will be able to see the film producers say was the late actor’s passion project starting December 13. Co-starring Genesis Rodriguez, the film follows Walker after hurricane that devastated New Orleans in 2005. Walker and Rodriguez play a couple about to become parents whose lives take a tragic turn when their baby is born with an illness during the chaos that came with Katrina. ‘He was looking for something to showcase his acting skills, which he so rarely had the chance to do. He hit it out of the park,’ Safran told THR. Safran believes the release is what the film’s star would have wanted. Tragic: Walker was 40 years old when the car he was in left the road Saturday and exploded in flames in Santa Clarita on Saturday afternoon . ‘Paul would have very much wanted us to move forward. He was incredibly proud of this project. We did a press junket two weeks ago, and I remember sitting with him and how excited he was for people to see this movie. He really looked to this movie to show people that he is an actor,’ the producer said. Walker died just before he was set to shoot key scenes for Fast & Furious 7 in Atlanta. Producers of that film must now decide how to move forward. Fast & Furious 7 was set to be released in July of 2014 and remained unfinished, so Universal must either change the plot of the upcoming film in a way that addresses Walker’s death or scrap the film altogether.","Passion project: The film Hours is a drama about Hurricane Katrina and stars Walker and Genesis Rodriguez .

The unaffected side of the biker’s face has been used to create a mirror image, which will enable perfect facial reconstruction. A computer image of 'scaffolding' for a human ear. The model was created by Wake Forest University in North Carolina, but a similar one will be used to create the 3D printed part of the unknown man's face . Computer images are being used to create titanium implants using Additive Manufacturing, which commonly known as 3D printing. The images are used both to design guides to cut and position facial bones with pinpoint accuracy and create tailor-made implants for the patient. The guides and implants are being produced in medical-grade titanium in Belgium, at one of the world’s few specialist 3D printing facilities. Surgeons in Swansea, south Wales, used an X-ray CT scan to create minutely detailed three-dimensional images to design the bespoke implants. The futuristic work is led by consultant maxillofacial surgeon Adrian Sugar, at Morriston Hospital, Swansea, run by Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board. A scaffolding nose is pictured, which could help patients who needs reconstructive surgery. It relies upon using the patient's own cells so that the body is less likley to reject a new osy part.

Peter Evans, a reconstructive scientist and Maxillofacial Laboratory Services manager, said: 'The patient suffered trauma and had multiple injuries across his body, including some quite severe facial injuries. 'He underwent emergency surgery at the time and we are now at the stage where we can do a proper reconstruction of his face.' The project is the work of the Centre of Applied Reconstructive Technologies in Surgery (Cartis), established in 2006 as a partnership between Morriston Hospital’s Maxillofacial Unit and Product Design and Research (PDR) based at Cardiff Metropolitan University. Cartis aims to make Wales a world leader in the research, development and application of advanced medical technologies in surgery. Mr Sugar and Mr Evans worked with PDR’s Sean Peel and Ffion O’Malley to virtually plan the complex surgery, which will involve repositioning the patient’s facial bones. Here, a finished ear, which consists of a coiled antenna inside a cartilage structure, is pictured. Two wires lead from the base of the ear and wind around a helical 'cochlea' - the part of the ear that senses sound - which can connect to electrod. It is just one example of a 3D printed organ . Mr Evans added: 'We have done everything up to the point of surgery. The concept of the operation has been virtually designed and we hope to do the work very soon. 'The patient’s facial symmetry will be restored so he should be back to normal as far as his facial looks are concerned.' Discussions are now taking place to plan when the surgery itself will take place. The identity of the patient concerned has not been revealed. Referring to the London exhibition, Mr Evans said: 'The exhibition is all about cutting-edge activities in this area of work so to have this case appear there is amazing.' Called 3D: Printing The Future, the exhibition continues at the Science Museum until July 1 next year.","Unaffected side of the biker’s face has been used to make a mirror image .

One of Britain’s top barristers will tomorrow demand the release of court papers from the trial of Stephen Ward, the high-society fixer at the centre of the Profumo sex scandal, claiming there has been a cover-up. Geoffrey Robertson QC will publicly criticise the National Archives for what he claims is its refusal to release the transcripts of the trial which took place 50 years ago. Such transcripts are routinely made available to the public and Mr Robertson last night said he was not aware of another case where relevant papers had not been disclosed. Stephen Ward with Christine Keeler (bottom left) Grundie Heiber and Sally Norrie (right) He said: ‘The Ward trial is the only trial in British legal history in which papers are being withheld. 'This is the most idiotic secrecy which has meant that the cover-up in relation to Stephen Ward continues to this day.’ Osteopath Dr Stephen Ward who was involved in the 1963 Profumo affair . Mr Robertson added: ‘They have refused me access on an entirely bogus claim that the disclosure of the documents would contrary to the Data Protection Act. Once a trial is heard in open court, the open justice principle requires transcripts relating to that trial to be public.’ Mr Robertson has carried out his own review of the Ward trial after a lifetime’s fascination with the case. Tomorrow he will publish his findings in a 190-page report which is expected to cast serious doubt on Ward’s 1963 conviction for living off immoral earnings. It could lead to renewed pressure that the conviction should  be overturned. The Profumo scandal was sparked by the . revelation that War Minister John Profumo had an affair with Christine . Keeler, a showgirl who was also in a relationship with a Russian naval . attache. Ward, a successful osteopath and society portrait painter, had . introduced the pair at a party in 1961. Ward . was subsequently charged with living off the immoral earnings of Keeler . and her friend Mandy Rice-Davies, and with a separate charge of . procuring prostitutes. He . took a fatal overdose before his trial at the Old Bailey ended and was . still in a coma when he was found guilty of the first charge but cleared . of the second. He died three days later on August 3, 1963. John Profumo, in his time as the Secretary of State for War before the scandal . Tony Blair wanted to give a knighthood to John Profumo but his plan was blocked by civil servants. Mr Blair believed that Profumo – forced to quit as Minister of War in 1963 over his scandalous affair with Christine Keeler – deserved the honour because he worked tirelessly to restore his public reputation. Documents obtained by this newspaper under Freedom of Information laws show that Mr Blair was considering a knighthood for the former Tory MP in the New Year’s Honours List of 2000 in recognition of Profumo’s work for charity, including the Toynbee Hall homeless project in London. But the documents also show that civil servants were adamant that Profumo did not deserve the award. One official wrote: ‘Toynbee Hall is not the most active or stimulating organisation. As a training provider it is very poor . . . we do not support a further honour.’ Profumo, who had already been awarded a CBE in 1975, died in 2006 aged 91. The decision to prosecute Ward, who is the subject of a new musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber, remains highly contentious. Sources close to Mr Robertson’s investigation – first revealed by this newspaper in September – say it will argue that either the conviction should be quashed or that Ward should be granted a Royal pardon. Tony Blair thought that John Profumo had worked hard to rebuild his reputation after the 1963 scandal . Mr Robertson declined to reveal his full conclusions, but added: ‘I do  analyse certain issues including whether the women were prostitutes at all, whether Ward lived off them or whether they, in fact, lived off him, and whether the judge behaved correctly in allowing the jury to convict on the evidence that was presented.’ A spokeswoman for the National Archives said none of the six files relating to the Ward case was described as a ‘transcript’. But she confirmed that one file which contained allegations of  prostitution and details of the sex lives of named individuals was  closed until 2046.","It is thought that 'covered-up' papers could clear Osteopath Stephen Ward .

Tax worker Ruth Kevan has been jailed for two and a half years for an elaborate scam to con her colleagues out of cash . It started as a little fund to encourage her tax office colleagues to save a few pounds for Christmas. But as it took off, so did Ruth Kevan’s money-making ambitions. The 58-year-old HM Revenue and Customs manager made bogus promises of interest rate returns up to 14.5 per cent to encourage 40 staff to invest thousands of pounds in her Christmas savings club. As a result, some paid in their retirement and wedding funds. By now, however, Kevan had turned the club into a Ponzi-style scam and was siphoning off cash to fund her own luxury lifestyle. In all, the civil servant stole more than £160,000 which she spent on extravagant holidays, expensive clothes and trips to watch Scotland play in the rugby Six Nations. Even her husband, who worked in the same office, was unaware of the scam. Yesterday, as her duped colleagues spoke of their ‘betrayal’, Kevan was beginning a two-and-a-half year jail term. Basildon Crown Court heard she had run the Christmas savings club at the tax office in Southend, Essex, since the late 1970s. The scheme started as an honest way to encourage workers to save for the festive season. But from 2001 she urged them to invest larger sums with the promise of interest rates way above levels offered by banks and building societies on the high street. Some of those who invested their money thought she had negotiated a special rate with the bank where the money was deposited. In fact, she was using the cash from new investors to spend on herself and pay out fake interest rates when it came to Christmas withdrawals. To prevent a ‘run’ on the fund at Christmas she offered bonus interest rates to keep the money in the account. One of Kevan's colleagues at HMRC Offices in Southend said: 'I feel betrayed by Ruth as I trusted her implicitly' Colleagues invested a total of more . than £212,000, but only £48,000 remained by the time the fraud was . discovered. Michael Warren, defending, said Kevan had resorted to the . scam after she became used to having more money thanks to a £35,000 . bequest from her father-in-law. He . said: ‘What is abundantly clear is that she is extremely remorseful and . ashamed of what happened. This scheme was not fraudulently run from the . outset. ‘I think we can . only speculate as to what happened but around the time the fraud started . her father-in-law passed away and left her with an inheritance of . £35,000, and she probably got accustomed to a nice lifestyle. She was . not aware the deficit had reached such a level – the matter had just got . out of hand.’ The fraud . was discovered when HMRC investigators became suspicious of large sums . of money being deposited in Kevan’s personal account. She . was arrested at work in April and confessed during a police interview. At court she admitted 21 charges of fraud and one of theft. Sentencing . her, Recorder George Pulman QC said: ‘You ran the Christmas club at . HMRC in Southend and encouraged people to put in more than just a few . pounds. ‘You lied to them as to the rates of interest, rates which were not available anywhere else commercially. ‘You . have expressed shame and made clear you know your behaviour has let . down friends and others who trusted you with their savings. ‘You frittered the money away on a luxury lifestyle of holidays and nice clothes.’ Kevan was sentenced at Basildon Crown Court to two-and-a-half years in prison for a string of fraud charges . One colleague wrote in a victim impact statement: ‘I feel betrayed by Ruth as I trusted her implicitly.’ The . court heard that Kevan, who lived in a £200,000 house in Southend, . planned to try to pay back the money when she started receiving her . pension in a few years’ time. Proceeds . of crime proceedings are ongoing to recover the victims’ money, . although investigators believe they may receive as little as a quarter . of what was invested. Kevan worked in a clerical role at HMRC. Following her suspension from duty she was dismissed in August 2012.","Ruth Kevan, 58, jailed for two-and-a-half years for string of fraud charges .

A Florida family who claim their daughter was shot dead by her sheriff's deputy boyfriend in a domestic violence dispute are demanding justice. Young mother Michelle O'Connell, 24, from St Augustine, was found dead of a gunshot wound to the mouth in September 2010 with her boyfriend, Jeremy Banks' duty weapon by her side. He claimed to have been in another room and that she took her own life. But Miss O'Connell's family are convinced she was murdered and that Mr Banks' police colleagues helped him cover up his involvement. Justice: Young mother Michelle O'Connell, 24, pictured, from St Augustine, was found dead of a gunshot wound to the mouth in September 2010 with her boyfriend, Jeremy Banks' duty weapon by her side . Their demands for a proper investigation into her death has now come to global attention as a result of a lengthy investigation by the New York Times. It found that after Mr Banks told his colleagues his version of events -that Miss O'Connell had broken up . with him and taken her own life - the St . Johns County sheriff's department effectively halted their . investigation. No evidence was tested, no family or neighbors were interviewed and no data was downloaded from Mr Banks' cellphone despite the fact that Miss O'Connell had shown no signs of being suicidal prior to her death. Her family told the paper that Miss O'Connell had been excited about a new full time job at a day care center and was enjoying being a mother to her 4-year-old daughter Alexis more than ever. But hours before the shooting she had made the startling confession to her sister, Christine, that Mr Banks had been violent towards her for months. She added that she wanted to leave him but was scared of how he would react if she did. But Mr Banks' colleagues at the sheriff's office weren't interested in Christine's testimony - the only thing Mr Banks was reprimanded for was not securing his service weapon when he got home. After months of pressure Sheriff David B. Shoar finally asked Florida Department of Law Enforcement to re-examine the case. An investigation led by Rusty Rodgers found two neighbors who heard an argument that night and a woman screaming for help before gunshots and then silence. Free: After Mr Banks, pictured, gave his colleagues his account - Ms O'Connell had broken up with him and was packing to move out when she shot herself - the St Johns County sheriff's department all but wrapped up their investigation . The women were submitted to polygraph lie-detector tests and passed. The results meant that state investigators, and the crime reconstruction expert they hired, were all convinced the sheriff's department botched the original investigation and that Miss O'Connell's death was a murder and not suicide. Mr Banks told the investigators that the couple were at a concert on the of Miss O'Connell's death and that she told him on the drive home she was leaving him. He said they argued briefly in the car and then 'we got to the house, we were fine.' According to him she went into another room to pack her belongings and then moments later he heard a pop. But neighbors Stacey Boswell and Heather Ladley, who were not approached by the sheriff's department, told the state investigators a different story. In separate interviews, they each said they were smoking cigarettes in Miss Boswell's open garage when they heard arguing and walked down the driveway to hear what was being said. Miss Boswell described how she heard a man and woman screaming and said she knew 'there was something wrong.' She added: 'There was nothing playful, no nothing. It was somebody that was scared.' They then heard a woman shout out 'help,' a gun shot and then 'help' again and another gun shot. After that, there was silence. Their account prompted the medical examiner Dr. Frederick Hobin to change his ruling from suicide to homicide. The investigators in February 2011 also examined the forensic evidence that was taken from the crime scene but never tested for fingerprints, DNA or gunshot residue. They found that there was no blood found on the gun, nor did it have any DNA or fingerprints from Mr Banks, which is surprising given he'd worn it on his belt on his previous shift. The lab also detected two spots of Ms O'Connell's blood on the inside of Mr Banks' T-shirt which casts doubt over his claim that he was in a different room when his girlfriend died. The state investigators' also questioned how the young woman came to have a bleeding cut above eye - a crime scene reconstructionist claimed the cut had occurred before the fatal shot, a defensive wound that indicated a struggle. But just as it appeared likely that charges would be brought, the local state attorney jolted the investigation, citing his close relationship to the sheriff, Mr Banks' boss. Happy: Rather than acting suicidal leading up to her death, Ms O'Connnell was excited about a new full time job at a day care center and enjoying her 4-year-old daughter Alexis more than ever, her family . A new medical examiner was appointed before the previous one officially changed his ruling from suicide to homicide. The new one backed the sheriff's original determination of suicide and claimed the bruise above Ms O'Connell's eye was caused by a tactical light on the gun. Three experts told The New York Times investigation that they didn't believe this was physically possible. Finally, the case went to special prosecutor Brad King who in March 2012 said he wasn't going to prosecute Jeremy Banks. 'The day my family met with Brad King I refer to as the second-worst day of my life,' Christine said,  'Losing my sister was the worst.' The state investigators were so unhappy they called for a special inquest and the re-constructionist claims the prosecutor who came to talk to him seemed to be intent on confirming the ruling of suicide rather than re-examining the case. He said: 'The whole tone of the interview was for me to tailor my report or soften my report to where it would be more conducive to suicide rather than homicide.' The memo explaining his decision said the testimony of the two witnesses who heard shouts and gunfire did not 'support any type of homicide conviction on its own.' In the end the prosecutor rejected the call for an inquest, a decision which was greeted with gushing praise by the sheriff effectively closed the case. However, when the newspaper started asking questions a year later he launched an inquiry into the state agency's investigation, alleging misconduct on behalf of the investigators. In March a report was released a report which claimed the second set of investigators hyped up their case against Mr Banks and coached witnesses. The report also claimed that the two witnesses had confessed they often smoked marijuana together and couldn't remember if they had done so that night even though the women said this was categorically not true. Three years later, Michelle O'Connell's mother, sisters and brother continue to believe she didn't kill herself. Chrisitine added: 'It's unfair to my sister, to her memory, to her daughter and to my family, I still am hopeful that eventually, it may be 20 years, but eventually, we will have justice for my sister and for her daughter.'","Michelle O'Connell, 24, from St Augustine, Florida died from a gunshot wound to the mouth in September 2010 .

Soaring house prices have caused a surge in the number of people leaving London for the suburbs, with more than a quarter of a million people abandoning the capital last year. But most of those who leave still feel the pull of the city, with the average move taking them just 26 miles away - firmly within commuting distance. Research by Hamptons International estate agents linked rises in London prices - which they say will go up 32 per cent in the next five years - with young families heading for more affordable areas. A jump in house prices has caused a spike in the number of people leaving London for the suburbs, research reveals today . Suburbia: Reigate in Surrey was a popular choice for those leaving London . City to city: Birmingham, pictured, was the single most popular destination for London leavers, but the trend was towards suburbia . They found that the average London . leaver is 32 years old, had children and moves for lifestyle reasons. The most popular destination was Birmingham - England's second-largest . city - with commuter belt towns in Essex, Surrey and Kent also a . frequent choice. But . while the estate agents found that big moves out of the city are on the . rise, they also discovered that many people who move go hardly any . distance at all, with the average distance in England and Wales just 2.5 . miles. For those moving within London it was as little as 1.3 miles. Hammptons head of sales, Marc Goldberg, said: 'In the last three months the number of London buyers registering with our country offices has increased by 12 per cent. 1.  Birmingham                        5,0002.  Brighton, Sussex               4,9503.  Elmbridge, Surrey              4,4204.  Epping Forest, Essex        4,2605.  Thurrock, Essex                 3,7606.  Manchester                        3,5507.  Hertsmere, Hertforshire   3,5208.  Medway, Kent                     3,5009.  Reigate, Surrey                  3,37010. Dartford, Kent                   3,360 . 'As house prices increase at a faster rate in London than anywhere else, Londoners are increasingly waking up to the idea that they can get more value for money outside the capital.' Half of the 250,000 Londoners who left the capital in 2012, moved to the south East and south West. Those between the ages of 19 and 25 are the most likely of all age groups to move to London as they either start university or new jobs. These new arrivals tend to move 34 miles to their new homes. The research comes as house prices rose by 0.5 per cent month-on-month in November as surging demand from buyers continues to outstrip the supply of homes for sale, according to property analysts Hometrack . But in a sign that prices could be starting to run ahead of what buyers are willing to pay, the typical percentage of the asking price achieved dipped in November to 95 per cent, from a six-year high of 95.2 per cent recorded in October. Commutable: Young families leaving London favoured locations with good access to London, such as Dartford in Kent, pictured . Seaside: Brighton was the second-most popular destination for those leaving London . It is the first time in 11 months that the percentage of the asking price has fallen, although the latest figure also masks a new record high of 97.7 per cent of asking prices being achieved in London. Widened mortgage availability is said to be fuelling demand from aspiring property buyers, but experts say that a lack of houses to choose from is pushing prices up. Richard Donnell, director of research at Hometrack, said: 'A widening gap between supply and demand continues to put upward pressure on house prices. Faster sales are eroding the stock of homes for sale, adding to the scarcity of housing.' Last week the Bank of England took the first step in applying the brakes to the property market by announcing it is refocusing a lending scheme towards helping small businesses borrow, which experts have warned could spell the beginning of the end for ultra-low mortgage rates. A mortgage price war broke out after Funding for Lending was launched in August last year and the number on the market has since surged by 40 per cent. Demand from some would-be home buyers is expected to pick up further in the coming months because of the Government's Help to Buy scheme which was extended in October to offer state-backed loans to people with 5% deposits.","Study found that 32 is the average age that Londoners move away .

Details of spare spaces will be transmitted to a central computer system and then fed to drivers via a smartphone app. Free space: 'Smart parking' bays that can detect when spaces are free will be rolled-out across Westminster, pictured, Birmingham, Manchester and Edinburgh next year . Drivers will also be able to enter a postcode to see any vacant spaces in their surrounding area. It is unclear how frequently the app will be updated to inform drivers that certain spaces are filled. After trialling the system on five streets, . Westminster City Council will introduce the technology from . January. Approximately 3,000 so-called SmartEye sensors will be . installed at all metered and disabled parking bays in the West End of . London. Birmingham, Manchester and Edinburgh are also conducting trials. Technology: Drivers will receive details of empty spaces to a smartphone app (library image) Council leaders . say that as well as sparing motorists the hassle of driving around busy . streets searching for a space, carbon emissions should be cut as well. Westminster calculates that motorists who decide against public transport spend on average 15 minutes looking for a parking space once they have reached the city centre. The council says that if the system — which is being paid for out of parking receipts — works it will be extended to 7,000 bays across the city. Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, told The Times: 'We have all driven in circles looking for somewhere to park when there is an empty bay around the corner we just don’t know about. 'This technology is already used in the States and the evidence shows a big rise in the utilisation of parking bays as motorists are matched with spaces. As a consequence there is less congestion.' Professor Glaister said that in Los Angeles and San Francisco data from the sensors was used to set different charges for individual bays based on the demand for parking at specific locations. 'This demonstrates to drivers that parking charges are about managing traffic and not raising revenue in the form of a stealth tax,' he said. He added that he would be concerned that people would spend more time not looking at the road and instead looking at screens of smartphones or sat-navs. Fines: Councils rolling-out the scheme insist it will not be used to collect parking fines (library image) Councils planning to roll-out the scheme insist they will not be using the technology to collect money via parking fines. Councils in England reaped £601 million from parking last year. It is thought they may collect £635 million this year. Westminster made the biggest profit of all councils, at £41.6 million - claiming the money is invested in roads and road infrastructure.","Infra-red sensors to be placed in parking bays in £1million scheme .

People could become infected with vCJD – the human form of ‘mad cow disease’ – from blood transfusions, experts are warning. An independent inquiry will be carried out into the safety of blood donations following fears of infection from vCJD, it has been reported. Studies have revealed that one in every 2,000 Britons could be carrying variant CJD and this has prompted the Commons Science and Technology Committee to call for action, the BBC said. People could become infected with vCJD - the human form of 'mad cow disease' - from blood transfusions, experts are warning . While blood tests cannot detect vCJD, strict measures are in place to prevent the risk of infection via blood. NHS Blood and Transplant does not allow donations from high-risk individuals - such as people who have had a blood transfusion - donor blood is stripped of white blood cells, and disposable instruments are used when possible in retrieving donor tissues. But some experts believe more could be done. Committee chairman Andrew Miller MP told the BBC: ‘Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease is a terrible condition and we were extremely concerned to hear evidence that this incurable disease still poses a significant risk to public health. One in every 2,000 Britons could be carrying variant CJD - the disease is most likely to be caused by consuming beef that has been infected with 'mad cow disease' ‘Although the risk of developing the disease as a result of eating contaminated beef was long ago eliminated, it is possible that the infection could still be unwittingly spread through medical procedures. ‘We were told that this may happen through failure to properly clean medical instruments, or, even more worryingly, through widespread contamination of the blood and organ supply.’ NHS Blood and Transplant says the UK has one of the safest blood supplies in the world. A spokeswoman said: ‘We are constantly looking to increase scientific understanding of risks of disease transmission through blood, organ and tissue donation. ‘We will submit evidence to this inquiry.’ CJD is a rare and fatal disease that affects the brain causing brain damage that becomes worse over time. Symptoms include loss of intellect, changes in personality, loss of balance, slurred speech, blindness and loss of mobility. Most people with the disease die within a year of the symptoms starting. Patients usually die from an infection because they become immobile meaning they are more vulnerable to infection. CJD is thought to be caused by an abnormal protein called a prion - these prions accumulate in the brain and cause irreversible damage to the nerve cells. It has killed 177 people in the UK - most in the 1990s and early 2000s.","The Commons Science and Technology Committee has called for an inquiry after studies showed one in 2,000 Britons could carry vCJD .

The BBC has admitted faking key scenes in a hit nature documentary about grizzly bears. Programme makers were forced to apologise after it emerged hit BBC1 show Great Bear Stakeout deliberately misled viewers by carefully editing footage. A dramatic episode appeared to show one of the documentary's expert guides watching and commentating as a mother bear took her cubs into the ocean, before one of them drowned. In fact, the guide – Chris Morgan – was never present at the touching scene. Filmed separately, the shots of him standing by the seaside were later edited together with the original footage to make it seem he was just yards from the dangerous animals. The truth was only revealed yesterday – more than seven months after it was aired on TV – after an investigation by the BBC’s governing body found the public were ‘misled’ and trust in the BBC could be damaged. Up close, but not too close: A bear inspects a remote camera in the documentary Great Bear Stakeout. But the show has been criticised for being less than honest . It is the latest in a series of fakery rows to engulf the BBC’s respected natural history unit, and comes just two years after it was revealed Sir David Attenborough’s Frozen Planet series had shown supposedly wild footage of a polar bear and her cubs – which was actually filmed in a zoo. Last night Tory MP John Whittingdale, who chairs the Commons culture, media and sport committee, said it was ‘completely unacceptable’ to fake footage, adding: ‘It is wrong to mislead viewers, and as has been the case in the past, if you have to edit footage so things are not exactly as they were, you should explain to viewers why that has happened. ‘Otherwise, the danger is people stop believing in the truth of these programmes and viewers’ confidence in the BBC’s output will be undermined. ‘I welcome the fact the BBC Trust have recognised that this was misleading and wrong.’ In its damning report yesterday, the corporation’s governing body admitted the latest scandal could further damage the public’s faith in its output. It said: ‘Viewers were on a journey with the guide and this was a crucial event which was interpreted through the eyes of the guide. On location? The Great Bear Stakeout team, including Chris Morgan (centre), pose up for the camera at Katmal National Park, Alaska . ‘The Trustees agreed that it was not acceptable to portray him as if he was present when he was not present. The public had been misled.’ Saying the BBC’s natural history programming is ‘one of the jewels in the crown of British broadcasting’, the BBC Trust report continued: ‘Enactments of this nature could undermine the trust of the public in the BBC’s natural history programmes and even risked casting doubt on the accuracy of the natural history depicted in the BBC’s programmes. ‘This would be an extremely unfortunate outcome which could damage a world class brand.’ Filmed in Alaska, Great Bear Stakeout drew plaudits when it was screened in April and captivated almost four million viewers. The fake scene – contained in the first of four episodes – showed a mother bear, Parsnip, taking her two cubs Pushki and Wren into the ocean. Wren was washed away by the waves and presumed drowned. 'It is wrong to mislead viewers and, . as has been the case in the past, if you have to edit footage so things . are not exactly as they were, you should explain to viewers why that has . happened. Otherwise . the danger is people stop believing in the truth of these programmes . and viewers’ confidence in the BBC’s output will be undermined' - MP John Whittingdale . The BBC Trust said producers gave repeated reassurances the shot was accurate. They did not reveal the true sequence of events because they felt it was ‘acceptable’ and ‘did not alter the editorial truth of the scene’. The report added: ‘It was only when a planned radio interview proposed to feature the cub-drowning sequence that the bear guide flagged up the fact that he had not actually been present at the time.’ In the wake of the revelations, the BBC required all natural history staff to carry out new training into editorial standards. The show’s executive producer Gavin Henderson said: ‘Please accept my apologies for this mistake. The Natural History Unit is taking immediate steps to address the issues raised and to prevent similar issues occurring by providing additional training across the entire unit.’ Following the Frozen Planet scandal in 2011, Sir David Attenborough – who narrated the series – defended the footage by saying he was ‘making movies’. Last year, an episode of Planet Earth Live – starring Richard Hammond and Julia Bradbury – was slammed by viewers after it emerged most of the first episode was in fact pre-recorded.","Scenes showed expert just yards from touching scenes of mother and cub .

McDonald's has apologised to a customer who was served this stomach-churning burger - which was raw in the middle. Sue Bennett, 43, choked in disgust as she took the top of the bun off the burger to remove the gherkins. One of the meat patties was pink and uncooked so she took it to the manageress, who tested it with a temperature probe. Disgusted: Sue Bennett has handed her raw McDonald's burger over to public health inspectors after she realised it was raw in the middle . It gave a reading of 39 degrees C - nearly half the minimum temperature for cooking the burger. Ms Bennett, a social services worker, was given a full refund for the Big Mac and a Fillet-o-Fish her husband Carl had bought at the branch in Dalton, Rotherham. She went home and alerted her local environmental services department who have now taken the burger away for examination. Ms Bennett, a mother-of-two, said: 'I was mortified. I took the burger apart to take off the gherkins and saw how red the burger was. It was so raw it was falling apart. 'I took it straight back to the manageress and asked her to test it. 'I know what the minimum core temperature of food should be as I've learnt about it as part of my job. 'I asked the manageress if she knew and she thought it may be 70C - it's actually a minimum of 75C. 'She put the probe in it and it showed 39C and I took it away.' Evidence: When she opened up the bun, Ms Bennet saw one of her burgers was so uncooked it was falling apart, right. A test found it was only 39C . McDonald's said it had retrained staff at its Dalton, Rotherham branch after this 'isolated incident' Ms Bennett, of Rotherham, said one of the patties in the Big Mac was properly cooked but the other was raw. She put the burger in a bag and stored it in her fridge until it was taken away by the environmental health officer on Wednesday. 'I'm not expecting any compensation - not that I was offered any, apart from my money back,' she said. 'But I don't think I'll be able to go back to McDonald's because I don't feel I can trust them any more. 'It's a shame because I did enjoy going there every now and then.' Rotherham Borough Council confirmed their Environmental Health department was investigating the complaint. McDonald's said: 'At McDonald's food quality and safety is of paramount importance.

Desperate: Gretchen Molannen, 39, was found dead in her home in Spring Hill, Florida, over the weekend from an apparent suicide. She had suffered from persistent genital arousal disorder (PGAD) for more than a decade-and-a-half . Trauma: The condition means the afflicted are physically but not psychologically aroused and can often only find relief after masturbating for hours upon end . It . is unclear how or when the 39-year-old died. The Hernando County . Sheriff’s office responded to a suicide call on Saturday night and two . of her friends confirmed it. The Tampa Bay Times had done a profile on Ms Molannen only a week before, speaking to her about her debilitating disorder. ‘I had such a different life before . this thing, this beast, took over,’ she said in November. Ms Molannen . explained that she began feeling the sensation when she was 23, . describing that it was like a switch she couldn’t turn off. 'I used to love life. But this has destroyed it. This isn't living. What's the point? I think about suicide . all the time,' she said. One of the only forms of relief came . from masturbating for hours on end, something that Ms Molannen, a . Lutheran, found as a point of shame. Though . she had aspirations of working as a translator as she is fluent in . French, German and Spanish, her condition meant that she had to take odd . jobs, because she had to deal with the physical demands of PGAD. But, . having to relieve herself almost constantly, she stopped working in . 1999 and started spending most of the time in her bedroom with her . vibrator. Agony: Gretchen Molannen, 39, pictured on her Facebook page wearing a mask, committed suicide on December 1 because of a debilitating condition which caused her to have repeated, uncontrollable orgasms . 'I was terrified,' she said. 'I couldn't get unaroused. I didn't know what to do.' Her distress over the condition made her attempt suicide three times in the past year. 'I know that God wants more out of my life than having me testing out suicide methods, constantly crying and abusing myself,' she said. She tragically revealed to the paper she had been molested for years by a neighbor, who said she was being punished for being bad. She wondered if that had anything to do with it? Persistent genital arousal disorder is a fairly recent phenomenon, first described in medical literature in 2001. Sufferers describe symptoms as only physical arousal. Women who have the disorder say that they experience symptoms that are intense and incredibly uncomfortable. Some women may temporarily lesson the symptoms by masturbating and reaching orgasm, though it is an ephemeral relief system. Treatment ranges from psychotherapy to various medications. Doctors don't agree what causes it but do agree on how debilitating it is. Women have described getting it after falling over, childbirth, menopause and coming off anti-depressants. She had a boyfriend, who emailed the Times after her original story was published, saying the article ‘won’t help her now’ because she had killed herself. They had sex around four times a year, the Times said, because it caused Ms Molannen hours of agony afterward. She agreed to it in a bid for physical intimacy. Unable to hold down any full-time employment. Ms Molannen said she tried to file for disability twice, and was twice denied. Because of this, the boyfriend had paid her taxes so she could keep her parents’ house. Her worst day, she said, was when she had 50 uncontrolled orgasms in a row. ‘It made me think I was going to die,’ she told the newspaper. 'That was the worst day.' Describing the first time she felt it, Ms Molannen said she thought it was just a hormonal change women went through that they didn't talk about, so she suffered in silence for ten years. 'I noticed something wasn't right any more but thought maybe I'll grow out of it. So I waited and waited - its been almost 16 years and I'm still waiting.' Describing the orgasms she experiences, she said: 'All the feelings that people have when they are aroused, they're there. The genital congestion, throbbing pulsating, heart pounding, it's all there but the difference is tremendous anxiety - anxiety which is devastating and traumatizing. 'I try to tell myself it's not real and just ignore it. Sometimes I can resist it and sometimes I just can't.' Breaking down in tears she told the Times: 'I had no idea other people were going through this . 'I wish I could have told my mom, and even my dad about it. I wish I could have told my parents' friends I wasn't in my room wasting my life away.' The paper found her after she posted an ad on Craigslist seeking help at the beginning of the year. She wanted someone to give her a free MRI scan so she could prove her condition to a judge. Tragically, after the story was published - and after she had committed suicide - a number of people reached out to the paper to offer their help. According to the Journal of Sex and Marriage Therapy, any number of events or medications can trigger the disorder, including going off antidepressants, starting menopause, and even a bad fall. It is unclear how many women suffer from the disease, but experts estimate it to be in the thousands. 'The arousal won't let up. It will not subside. It will not relent. One O-R-G will lead you directly into the horrible intense urge, like you're already next to having another one. So you just have to keep going. 'I mean, on my worst night I had 50 in a row. I can't even stop to get a drink of water. And you're in so much pain. You're soaking in sweat. Every inch of your body hurts. Your heart is pounding so hard. 'You have to ignore it, Gretchen. YOU DON'T HAVE A CHOICE. STOP NOW. Just let your body calm down. Many times, I've tried that. 'I'd be as far as in the bathroom, going in for my reward shower. I'm done. Now it's time to clean up and relax. And I'd look at myself in the mirror and there it is again. And I'd throw myself on the floor and cry. 'Men don't understand it. They don't care. They think it's hot...When I describe it to men, I tell them, ""Imagine having an erection that does not go down, that feeling of just before it comes out, all day, all night, no matter how many times, no matter how much you've destroyed the skin on your penis"". 'It won't let you calm down. You can't go to sleep. You think you are going to have a heart attack. You think you are going to die.'

CBS has forced 60 Minutes correspondent Lara Logan and her producer to take a leave of absence due to their discredited story about the attack on the American embassy in Benghazi. The move comes after a critical internal review of the controversial October segment which relied heavily on the testimony of a supposed witness whose account has now been proved as false. The review by CBS News executive Al Ortiz said the 60 Minutes team- and specifically Logan and her producer Max McClellan- should have done a better job vetting the former security contractor later identified as Dylan Davies. Scroll down for video . Sorry is not enough: Lara Logan publicly apologized for the Benghazi report twice but on Tuesday CBS announced that they were putting her on a leave of absence one month after the original segment aired . Immediately after the segment aired on October 27, questions were quickly raised about whether the man was lying — something 60 Minutes should have better checked out before airing the story, the report said. Producer: Max McClellan was also put on a leave of absence starting on Tuesday for his involvement in the story . 'Logan and producer Max McClellan told me they found no reason to doubt Davies’ account and found no holes in his story. But the team did not sufficiently vet Davies’ account of his own actions and whereabouts that night,' the report stated. The report also said Logan should not have done the story in the first place after making a speech in Chicago a year ago claiming that it was a lie that America's military had tamed al Qaeda. 'From a CBS News Standards perspective, there is a conflict in taking a public position on the government’s handling of Benghazi and Al Qaeda, while continuing to report on the story,' Ortiz concluded, as seen in the full memo published on The Huffington Post. CBS News Chairman Jeff Fager, who is also the 60 Minutes executive producer, said he had asked Logan and McClellan to take a leave of absence of an undetermined length. Fager said he prides himself on catching almost everything, 'but this deception got through and it shouldn't have.' There was no word about whether Fager will face any repercussions for his role. 'The . 60 Minutes journalistic review is concluded, and we are implementing . ongoing changes based on its results,' said CBS News spokeswoman Sonya . McNair, not making clear what those changes were. Under scrutiny: An internal review concluded that Logan and her producer should have vetted the source more thoroughly and used other channels at CBS to get more information from government sources . The original segment relied heavily on the testimony of Davies- who went by the pseudonym that he used . while writing a book about his version of events, Morgan Jones- said . that he scaled a 12 foot wall and fought off a terrorist when he arrived . at the consulate on the evening of the attack. He also said that he later saw the body of Ambassador Chris Stevens when he went to a local hospital that evening. The newsmagazine believed his account that he was at the scene even after informing CBS that he told his employers that he wasn't there — something that Ortiz said should have raised a 'red flag' about his story. 'This crucial point – his admission that he had not told his employer the truth about his own actions – should have been a red flag in the editorial vetting process,' the report stated. In hiding: Dylan Davies told a story that has now been proved to be false during a 60 Minutes interview and has since received death threats against his family . Logan has not made any statement regarding her suspension, which was announced on Tuesday as many people started heading out of town for the Thanksgiving holiday, but she was then one to make two public apologies less than a week after the original segment aired. Logan said during her on-air mea culpa on November 8 that they were aware of the discrepancy between the version of events that he was telling CBS and the Blue Mountain Group report. Before they aired the piece he told them that he lied in the company’s report to go along with his boss’ story which said that Davies tried going to the mission but there were roadblocks and he couldn’t make it. 'His boss is someone he cared about enormously. He cared about his American counterparts in the mission that night, and when his boss told him not to go, he couldn't stay back. So that was always part of the record for us,’ Logan said. She made it clear that what they did not know was that Davies had given that account to the FBI in their incident report. His involvement with the FBI report came via The Washington Post after the 60 Minutes piece aired, and Logan said that when they confronted him over the claims, he denied it. Logan said that they have since tried contacting Davies about the situation and they have not been able to get in touch with him. Mea culpa : Logan said on November 8 (pictured) that they were wrong to air her interview with a man called Dylan Davies who lied about his role on the night of the attacks on the American mission to Benghazi . ‘We were misled and we were wrong and . that's the important thing and that's what we have to say here: we have . to set the record straight and take responsibility,’ she said. 'The . most important thing to every person at 60 Minutes is the truth, and . today the truth is we made a mistake. That's very disappointing for any . journalist, that's very disappointing for me. ‘Nobody . likes to admit that they made a mistake, but if you do, you have to . stand up and take responsibility and you have to say that you were wrong . and in this case we were wrong.’ Davies . motivation to lie presumably has something to do with the fact that he . is coming out with a book about alleged warnings that he gave the U.S. government about security flaws before the attack. The publisher of the book, The Embassy House, has now said that they have retracted the book. Pulled: The publisher announced on Friday that it will stop selling Davies' book . It had already been on sale online and an unknown number of people had already bought the book. Simon & Schuster announced that 'in light of information that has been brought to our attention' they will no longer be selling the book. The book itself was another problem for '60 Minutes' because while they did disclose that Davies had a book that was being published, they failed to mention that Threshold Editions is an imprint of Simon & Schuster which is owned by CBS. CNN said that they got a statement from Davies who said that his book is 'consistent' with what he told U.S. authorities and the FBI, but their own reporter said that there were discrepancies between his book and official reports. When asked about what steps they took to vet that Davies was telling the truth before they put him on air, Logan said that they did independent research and also used material that he provided. 'We verified that he was who he said he was, that he was working for the State Department at the time, that he was in Benghazi at the Special Mission compound the night of the attack,' she said on CBS' morning news show. 'He gave us access to communications that he had with government officials. we used US government reports and congressional testimony to verify many of the details  of his story and everything checked out. He also showed us photographs that he had taken at the Special Mission compound the following morning.'

Alec Baldwin has come to the defense of his former colleague Martin Bashir, saying that MSNBC went too far in firing the anchor over his call to have someone defecate in Sarah Palin's mouth. 'I'm sorry to learn that @MartinBashir is out at MSNBC... Bashir created great television,' the actor wrote on his Twitter account on Thursday. 'You can disapprove of Bashir's single remark and still acknowledge his talent.' Baldwin has a vested interest in the firing as he was in a similar position less than two weeks earlier after he and his short-lived cable show were ousted from the network following his homophobic insults to reporters. Helping him out: Alec Baldwin (right) tweeted that he thought Martin Bashir (left) should not have had to resign over one inappropriate comment . Hedging his bets: Baldwin came out against the comments but said that Bashir 'created great television' Though Bashir made his inappropriate comments about the former Alaskan governor around the same time as Baldwin was recorded using the homophobic slur, Baldwin was fired much more quickly. The actor then cited the fact that Bashir had yet to be reprimanded as an example of the network's hypocrisy. He clearly has changed his tune in light of the Wednesday afternoon announcement that Bashir was facing a similar fate after having his resignation accepted by MSNBC bosses. Baldwin, 55, posted a string of Twitter messages to his widely-followed account saying that while what Bashir said was wrong, it was also wrong for him to be forced out over the incident. 'Broadcasters on certain networks are called upon to offer analysis of events and public policy, day in, day out often with tremendous aggression and scalding language,' Baldwin wrote. 'If, over the course of hundreds of hours on the air, they commit a foul then it's like high-sticking in hockey or a late hit in the NFL. Throw a flag. But to end someone's job?' 'Some of these cable venues really are Off-Off Television....And their need for a reliable, even forced, homogeneity is more apparent than ever. Whatever side of the political aisle they line up on.' Bringing it to an end: Palin said that it was right for Bashir to leave his show and it showed him taking responsibility for his actions . Baldwin's show of support came hours after Bashir released a statement saying he would be leaving MSNBC after hosting his eponymous show on the channel for three years. Palin also spoke out about the resignation, saying that his decision to take himself off the air was an example of the mainstream media doing the right thing.

A crazed customer launched a 'wolf-like' attack on a chip shop owner, biting and scratching him because he refused to refund her £1.35 for 'disgusting' potato scallops. Paulos Iasonides, 67, was left needing hospital treatment after Hayley Jones, 33, dug her teeth into his arm for around 40 seconds while he tried to shake her off. During the struggle, Jones drew blood by scratching Mr Iasonides' ear with her nails and also kicked him.

The victim's wife Hariklitsa Iasonides, . 59, who was running a hairdressers upstairs, heard screaming and . shouting and came downstairs to help her husband restrain Jones and . eject her from the shop. When police arrived at Reedley chip shop in Brierfield, Lancashire, they found Jones pacing up and down outside the shop screaming and shouting at her victim. The Cypriot-born father-of-four revealed he has been left so disturbed by the attack that he is now suffering from panic attacks and waking up in the middle of the night screaming. Mr Iasonides, who is now scarred for life, later told police: 'She was like a mad person. She was like a wolf.' At Burnley Crown Court, Jones was handed a 44-week jail sentence suspended for two years, with two years' supervision. Paulos Iasonides at his Reedley Chippy in Lancashire where the attack happened . Jones had bought a scallop from Paulos Iasonides' Reedley Chippy in Lancashire, but she returned three or four minutes later and demanded her money back, claiming the food was 'disgusting' She was convicted by a jury of occasioning actual bodily harm at an earlier hearing. He said: 'I cannot believe the behaviour of that woman on that day - I've never had any trouble like that before. 'She . was like a crazy woman, acting like a wild animal.

He was left bleeding from a wound to his arm and a scratch to his neck . The court heard the incident occurred on April 12 at 2pm whilst Mr Iasonides was serving lunchtime customers. Jones who had been drinking brandy walked in and began arguing with Mr Iasonides about his prices before ordering a tea cake and three potato scallops. She paid £1.35 and went outside but returned several minutes later, shouted abuse at Mr Iasonides him and demanded her money back. He added: 'She was shouting and screaming saying the food was disgusting and she wanted her money back. A lad who was in the shop saw her being nasty and he ran away because he was so scared. 'To get rid of her because I could tell she was nasty and drunk I got her arm and said ""go"" but she wouldn't go and she wanted her money.

She was saying ""I want my money"". We tried to push her out and she put her hands on the wall and wouldn't go. 'Somehow we managed to push her away and she bit me as I was standing at the door. I still have a scar. She also scratched me behind the ear and she kicked my leg. Eventually we pushed her outside and I stood in the door so she couldn't get in. 'She was walking up and down the street shouting and swearing until the police came. Two vans came and they took her and saw she was drunk and my wife said I was bleeding and that's when we find out she'd scratched me too.' Mr Iasonides went to hospital to get treatment for his wounds and had to undergo blood tests to see if he had suffered any infections as a result of the bite wound. He has since been prescribed tablets for the stress. The hearing was told Jones had convictions for common assault from 1998 and 2002 and possessing an offensive weapon in 2003.

Scroll down for video... Boldly go: The metallic disc peeps out from behind a tree outside the stadium walls . Writing in HuffPost Live, Mr Speigel claims that the increased use of unmanned drones by government and private groups is responsible for this figure. ‘The thing about drones is…that you can make them look like UFOs,’ Mr Speigel said. ‘You can go to the local hardware store, and for not a lot of money, you can pick up the materials you need…to make people go crazy.’ In September, for instance, spectators at the Nat Bailey Stadium in Vancouver, Canada, were stunned to spot what appeared to be a UFO in the sky. Mysterious: The internet exploded with sightings of the 'alien spacecraft' being driven along the Capitol Beltway near College Park on the back of a truck at around 11 p.m. The blue object, adorned with the requisite flashing lights, appeared during the first game of the best-of-three North Division final between the Vancouver Canadians and Everett AquaSox. The UFO was in fact a drone flown by the Canadian planetarium to deliberately fool spectators.

"By . Marie-louise Olson . PUBLISHED: . 20:17 EST, 1 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 21:12 EST, 1 December 2013 . In an observatory deep in an inhospitable area of the South Pole, a group of American scientists have been holed up for the last two years, waiting with baited breath for a little sign - something to show that they were not going loopy looking for a tiny little particle that no one has ever seen. That day has finally come and the researchers have announced they have reached a new frontier in studies of the universe - a discovery they are calling a ‘new age of astronomy’. The US-led $270m IceCube facility based on a cubic kilometre of Antarctic ice has detected very high-energy cosmic neutrinos - subatomic particles that reach Earth from deep space, possibly the remnants from exploding stars, called supernovae. Ordinary telescopes cannot see the elusive neutrinos, but IceCube's can. It is the largest neutrino telescope in the world. A new frontier: The IceCube detector, the world's largest neutrino observatory, has observed the first solid evidence for high-energy neutrinos that originate outside of our own solar system . Elusive: View of the subatomic neutrino tracks showing electrons and muons caught in a nano second. Ordinary telescopes cannot see the neutrinos . Unlike photons, aka light particles, they hardly ever interact with ordinary matter, because they carry no electric charge and very little mass. This makes them extremely hard to detect. The IceCube facility, however, can see neutrinos, which stream across the universe in unimaginable quantities, according to FT. What makes neutrinos so important to astronomers’ probes is that they travel in absolutely straight lines from their source without being deflected by magnetic fields or absorbed by matter. They escape more readily than photons from the core of a supernova, for example, or other such phenomena in the universe. Supernova: Neutrinos escape more readily than photons from the core of a supernova, such as the Tycho supernova, which exploded 400 years ago . Spectacular: A star in the constellation Taurus a thousand years ago is spewing out a blizzard of extremely high-energy particles, some of which could be the neutrinos that were discovered at the IceCube observatory . Neutrinos have already been detected in various forms. The first was 'seen' in 1956. However, scientists had not yet detected the pure form of neutrinos that are at least one million times more energetic than those already detected. These are the ones produced from turbulent gaseous environments left over by supernova explosions, also known as the supernova remnants. The IceCube was built in the South Pole to maximise the chance of observing these elusive cosmic neutrinos. Remnants: The neutrinos that were found are the ones produced from turbulent gaseous environments left over by supernova explosions, also known as the supernova remnants . The IceCube was built in the South Pole to maximise the chance of observing these elusive cosmic neutrinos . Rearchers melted holes in the ice cap and lowered 5,160 light detectors to depths of between 1,500m and 2,000m beneath the surface. Neutrino detectors are often built underground in order to isolate the detector from cosmic rays and other background radiation. Although trillions of neutrinos travel unscathed through the observatory every second, a precious few arrive at exactly the right angle to hit an atom in the ice. This collision generates electrically charged particles which radiate light that is picked up by the detectors. Underground: The IceCube crew melted holes in the ice cap and lowered 5,160 light detectors to depths of between 1,500m and 2,000m beneath the surface . Isolate: Neutrino detectors are often built underground in order to isolate the detector from cosmic rays and other background radiation . Computers then calculate the energy and incoming direction of the neutrino from the pattern and intensity of the light emitted. The IceCube team last week said in the journal Science they had detected 28 high-energy neutrinos coming from beyond the solar system over two years. Lower-energy neutrinos reach us in vast numbers from the sun and also from the interaction between cosmic rays and Earth’s upper atmosphere. These 28 neutrinos are too small a sample to derive any conclusions about what produced them, but whatever it is must generate staggeringly high energies. Reaction: Just a handful of the trillions of neutrinos that travel through the observatory every second arrive at exactly the right angle to hit an atom in the ice . Lower-energy neutrinos reach the Earth in vast numbers from the sun and also from the interaction between cosmic rays and the upper atmosphere, but high-energy particles are from further away . 'Gratifying': Prof. Francis Halzen, principal investigator of IceCube says the discovery is what they have been looking for. 'This is the dawn of a new age of astronomy,' he said . Two of the detected neutrinos had more energy than a fly in flight, packed into a single subatomic particle. Likely sources include supernovae and material being sucked into huge black holes. ‘It is gratifying to finally see what we have been looking for,’ says Francis Halzen of the University of Wisconsin and IceCube principal investigator. ‘This is the dawn of a new age of astronomy.’ The IceCube project is part of the University of Wisconsin–Madison projects developed and supervised by the same institution, while collaboration and funding is provided by numerous other universities and research institutions worldwide. Neutrinos were first detected in 1956 by Clyde Cowan, Frederick Reines, F. B. Harrison, H. W. Kruse, and A. D. McGuire, who published confirmation that they had detected the neutrino in Science, a . result that was rewarded almost forty years later with the 1995 Nobel . Prize. The detection of solar neutrinos, and of neutrinos of the SN 1987A supernova in 1987 marked the beginning of neutrino astronomy. The normal energy of supernova neutrinos ranges from a few to several tens of MeV. However, the sites where cosmic rays are accelerated are expected to produce neutrinos that are at least one million times more energetic, produced from turbulent gaseous environments left over by supernova explosions: the supernova remnants. This is the type of neutrino that scientists believe has been detected now for the first time. Neutrinos travel in absolutely straight lines from their source without being deflected by magnetic fields or absorbed by matter. This means they show exactly what is out there in its purest form.","US-led $270m astronomical facility, IceCube, has detected neutrinos, subatomic particles from deep space .

Clothing sizes don’t always seem to make sense; a large in one shop can be a medium in another, but what if you could get a 3D-printed sweater that fits perfectly? Appalatch, based in North Carolina, already makes woollen and cotton clothes and has now set up a Kickstarter campaign to buy a Stoll knitting machine - dubbed a ‘3D printer for clothes’ - that can knit custom-made clothes with minimal waste. It is a modern-day version of a traditional knitting loom or flat knitting machine and 'prints' clothes by reading measurements from software. Scroll down for video . Clothing company Appalatch has set up a Kickstarter campaign to fund mass production of 100 per cent woollen sweaters made on a 3D printer. Its founders want the money to buy a Stoll knitting machine, pictured, that can take a customer's exact measurements to produce custom-made clothes . The Stoll knitting machine is dubbed a ‘3D printer for clothes’. It is a modern-day version of a . traditional knitting loom or flat knitting machine and 'prints' clothes . by reading measurements from software. To make a sweater, a customer sends the measurements to Appalatch online. These are entered into the machine, which knits the custom-made clothes using wool. The pieces are then sewn together and the finished item is posted. Appalatch founders Mariano deGuzman and Grace Gouin said: ‘We’ve all been there. We shop only to be frustrated and disappointed. 'The sleeves are too short, the length is too long, or the body is too tight. 'Additionally, standard clothing fits one way for one brand and a completely different way for another brand.’ They want Appalatch to be the first company in the world to make 'custom-fit sweaters on a mass scale.' The pair is asking for $50,000 (£31,000) to buy a Stoll Fully Fashion knitting machine. The sweaters will be sold in natural, navy, charcoal and camel, pictured top left to bottom right. They are made from Rambouillet wool. Appalatch's current range of sweaters start at $80 (£50). The 3D-printed designs are expected to cost a similar amount and should be shipped after the campaign closes on 6 December . Customers will then be able to send Appalatch their measurements online, including sleeve length, torso length, chest and waist circumference. These measurements will be put into the Stoll machine and the device will ‘print’ a sweater based on the precise dimensions. The pieces will then be sewn together. ‘It’s a total game changer when it comes to making clothing’, said deGuzman. ‘Stoll's knitting machine is essentially a 3D printer for garments allowing us to create any knitted garment in any dimension imaginable.’ The machine can also reduce the amount of waste wool that traditional knitting machines and looms can create. Appalatch is also working on cotton t-shirts for women, pictured left, and men, pictured right, that can also be 'printed' using the Stoll machine. The company claims the garments will be 'long lasting' The sweaters will be sold in natural, navy, charcoal and camel for both men and women. They are made from 100 per cent fine 21.5 Micron Rambouillet wool from Montana sheep. Appalatch is also working on cotton sweaters using materials from Texas and claims all of the garments are ‘long lasting.’ ‘Ultimately we want you to buy less’ said Gouin, ‘but we want you to wear it for longer.’ Appalatch's current range of T-shirts start at around $60 (£37) and sweaters start at $80 (£50). The 3D-printed designs are expected to cost a similar amount, although larger sizes may cost extra. Appalatch will also ship to the U.S, UK and other countries after the campaign ends on 6 December.","Appalatch sweaters are ‘printed’ using a Stoll knitting machine .

Her body is her career so it makes sense that no expense is spared when it comes to the health regime of supermodel Miranda Kerr. Indeed, the slender Victoria's Secret girl is so keen to keep her diet on the straight and narrow that she has invested £500 in a swanky blender she says does a whole lot more than just whizz up fruit and veg, reported health and beauty site Get The Gloss this week.. MIranda's kitchen companion is a state-of-the-art Vitamix Total Nutrition Centre (now there's a name for a kitchen gadget) she uses to whip up her much-loved daily smoothie: a chia seed and goji berry concoction. Gadget: The Vitamix Total Nutrition Health Centre blender is loved by health conscious A-listers like Miranda Kerr, but it will set you back £500 . Celebrity trainer Tracy Anderson (famous for training Gwyneth and Madonna) is a fan, and personal trainer and nutrition expert James Duigan rates the machines highly too, using one to make 60 shakes a day at Bodyism, his London gym. After a year and a half of very high usage, Duigan says the blender is still as good as ever. He uses his to blend up shakes for the likes of Bodyism client Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, who has previously extolled the virtues of his Clean & Lean Body Brilliance and Beauty Food smoothies . mixed with almond milk and coconut oil. And Duigan's wife Christiane whips up soups in a few minutes while juggling work and baby. 'It's actually kind of a miracle,' he says. High praise indeed. So what sets this blender apart from the norm? The kitchen device markets itself as much more than an ordinary blender thanks to laser-cut blades that reach speeds of 240 mph making light work of fruit and vegetable pulp, skin, pips and seeds. The high powered blades create a ‘blend’ of smoothie or juice that contains 100 per cent of the goodness and nutrients from fruit and vegetables. The firm claims that the Vitamix . blender is powerful enough to break down the cell walls of fresh, whole . foods to deliver the full benefit of nutrients. Tough fibrous cell . walls on fruits work like a barrier, they say, preventing us from . efficiently digesting the nutrients inside our bodies. Removing these with a powerful chopping tool can help your body digest all the nutrients available in the ingredients. Fresh fan: Miranda made a video for Net-a-porter showing her fans how to whip up her morning smoothie using the expensive gadget . The device, whose jug is made of the same material as aeroplane windows or police riot shields, grinds wholegrains into flour, makes ice cream in moments by whizzing frozen berries with yoghurt or cream, and can make hot soup . in five minutes from fresh vegetables thanks to the friction created by the fast-spinning blades. Nutritionists say making soup in this way is the healthiest method of cooking as you can . evenly warm a soup through without burning any of the ingredients or boiling away nutrients. You can put apple core, stalks, carrot tops, peel of lemon and lime or ginger in the machine. Wholefoods use it to make smoothies, Starbucks make frappuccinos using the device and McDonalds even make their McFlurrys with it. Laying her blender love on the line, Miranda Kerr made a video tutorial for Net-a-porter's The Edit to show her fans exactly how to create her morning smoothie at home. ‘Boys like their cars, I like my Vitamix,' she joked in the tutorial. Shona Wilkinson, Head Nutritionist at The Nutri Centre, said: 'The numbers of stars following juice diets has sped into the stratosphere of late. 'From A-listers wanting to get red carpet ready to reality stars wanting to trim down and get healthy, they're all on board the juicing train. 'So it was only a matter of time before a new juicing machine took celebsville by storm. 'Vitamix is a new juicer that claims to speed up the juicing process and leave a smoother, 'no bits' result. Good news for juicing fans.' Nutritionist Madeleine Shaw, who works with Millie Mackintosh, said: 'Vitamix is awesome, it is obviously the best of the bunch. However Kenwood are making some really good less expensive blenders too.' Personal trainer: James Duigan of Bodisym, who is credited with sculpting Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Elle Macpherson's bodies, is also a fan of the Vitamix blender . Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, who has one of showbiz's most enviable figures, recently praised her ‘delicious green juice' which she described as 'a . great way to start the day.' But what’s behind this mysterious . concoction? Along with other super healthy ingredients such as cucumber, . kale and parsley, the Japanese wholefood Chlorella is added to the . juice. And it’s not just Rosie . who’s caught the Chlorella bug, Miranda . Kerr has admitted that she takes Chlorella supplements to keep her skin . in check. green vegetable smoothie . Nadia Brydon, who’s a nutritionist and green food expert at Sun Chlorella, has shared her tips for the perfect morning smoothie.... 'With everyone from Rosie Huntington-Whiteley to Millie Mackintosh drinking green smoothies recently, you’d be forgiven for thinking this is just another beauty fad. 'We all know that we’re probably not eating enough greens, yet our greens contain the most vitamins and minerals of any foods we eat, and are the most important category of foods to consume on a daily basis to help keep us healthy. Green smoothies can be high in vitamin B12, which can help reduce tiredness, and magnesium, which is found in dark green vegetables and can act as nature’s tranquiliser, helping to keep us de-stressed and relaxed – so it’s no wonder so many busy celebs are trying it! You’ll notice that a lot of models are now adding green supplements to their juices, to up their nutrient intake even further. For instance, a daily serving of the Japanese wholefood Sun Chlorella contains iron content equivalent to nine cups of spinach (270g) and the same B12 content as a 32oz steak. Perhaps most importantly, these drinks provide large quantities of whole food natural vitamins and minerals and help increase our daily intake of fruit and vegetables – for busy people who still want to remain healthy, this is hugely important. Smoothies are also full of fibre and water along with a whole range of nutrients which naturally makes us feel fuller which reduces the desire to consume food generally especially sugar and carbohydrates. We recommend the Rolls Royce of blenders, the Vitamix blender, as it breaks down the cell walls of fresh, whole foods to deliver the full benefit of nutrients. It also saves time as all of the ingredients can be added at once.' Miranda and Rosie’s green juices and smoothies are so nutritious, simply because greens contain the most vitamins and minerals of any foods we eat, and are the most important category of foods to consume on a daily basis to help keep us healthy. Combining these into an easy to drink smoothie can help busy people cram as many of these vegetables into their daily diet as possible. Juicing and blending raw green vegetables and living micro greens (sprouts) containing fresh vibrant green chlorophyll are extremely nutritious ways of creating optimum health and energy. Just juice: Rosie Huntington-Whiteley has revealed that she loves Chlorella (like those pictured right) green juices . Juicing or blending any raw green vegetable, especially the living leafy varieties, is an effective way of increasing oxygen in the body and helping to build healthy tissues. Oxygen maintains life and is a rejuvenator of all body systems. Green smoothies containing the ingredients seen in Rosie and Miranda’s can be high in vitamin B12, which can help reduce tiredness. The spinach in Rosie’s signature smoothie is high in magnesium, which is found in dark green vegetables and can act as nature’s tranquiliser, helping to keep us de-stressed and relaxed – so it’s no wonder so many busy celebs are trying it!

For instance, a daily serving of the Japanese wholefood Sun Chlorella contains iron content equivalent to nine cups of spinach (270g) and the same B12 content as a 32oz steak – vitamin D in particular is important for winter, as this nutrient is produced by natural sunlight, and long cold winters can cause Brits to become deficient, meaning it’s important to top up where possible.   To make a Rosie or Miranda style green smoothie, try the delicious recipe below at home.

Michael Dunn is on trial today for the first-degree murder in the November 23, 2012 shooting death of 17-year-old Jordan Davis . A Florida murder trial, stemming from an argument over loud music at a gas station that ended in the shooting death of an unarmed black teenager, began today reviving a debate over the state's gun control and self-defense laws. Michael Dunn, 47, faces first-degree murder charges in the death of high school junior 17-year-old Jordan Davis on November 23, 2012. The white, middle-aged software engineer opened fire on a car with four black teenage boys inside that was parked next to him in the parking lot of a Jacksonville gas station convenience store in northeast Florida. Dunn has said he feared for his life, . drawing comparisons to the trial of George Zimmerman, the former central . Florida neighborhood watchman who was acquitted last year of murder . after saying he shot a 17-year-old unarmed black teenager, Trayvon . Martin, in self-defense. Dunn . said he had asked the teenagers to turn down the volume of their music. From the back passenger seat, Davis refused and the two exchanged . words. Dunn says he opened fire because he saw the barrel of a gun . pointed out the back window at him, though police found no weapon. The . case has garnered national and international media attention because of . the racial overtones and the self-defense claims. Like Zimmerman, Dunn . said he feared a black teenager who was unarmed. If found guilty, Dunn faces life in prison. Prosecutors say they won't seek the death penalty. Dunn's . attorney, Cory Strolla, has filed motions asking the judge not to allow . references in the trial to comments Dunn made in jailhouse letters or . phone calls where he referred to Davis and to some inmates as 'thugs', . and made other 'alleged racial comments,' according to court documents. Life lost: Police say Davis was unarmed, and no weapon was found in the SUV where he was riding . In a letter that Dunn sent to a local television reporter, he described Davis as a thug. 'This . case has never been about loud music,' Dunn wrote to news anchor . Heather Crawford in October. 'This case is about a local thug . threatening to kill me because I dared to ask him to turn the music . down.' Strolla also asked that the judge bar the prosecution from referring to Davis as a 'victim'. The . media attention will also thrust back into the spotlight Jacksonville's . state attorney Angela Corey, the special prosecutor who was chosen by . Florida Governor Rick Scott to handle the Zimmerman case. She . is also the prosecutor in the case of Marissa Anderson, a Jacksonville . woman sentenced to 20 years in prison for firing what she said was a . warning shot at her abusive husband. Jordan's parents, Ron Davis and Lucia McBath, said they plan to be in the courtroom throughout the trial. Dunn says he opened fire because he saw the barrel of a gun pointed out the back window at him, though police found no weapon . 'I . need to experience what happened to my son that day,' Ron Davis told . Reuters. 'As a parent you want to know, ''What happened to my son' Why . did you do this to my son.''' Since . their son's death, Davis and McBath have become advocates for gun . control and for changing Florida's Stand Your Ground law, which allows . people in fear of serious injury to use deadly force to defend . themselves rather than retreat. They . have testified before the Florida state legislature and the United . States Congress. Both have appeared on national television, talking . about the case and about their son. After . the trial, Davis said he will continue to work to have the state Stand . Your Ground law revised to include a duty to retreat. If someone is . threatened in public, Davis said, the law should require that he or she . try to defuse the situation rather than use deadly force. That requirement might have changed the outcome for his son, he said. 'In . your home, you have every right to protect your castle,' Davis said. 'In public, we can't all walk around acting like we are in our home, . telling people what to do in a public place. We have to share the public . space.' Tragic: Davis, pictured left and right, was riding in the back seat of an SUV with his three friends after a shopping trip in 2012 when the confrontation happened. The teen's companions were unarmed . Grieving: Davis' parents, Lucia Kay McBath, left, and Ron Davis, right, called on Florida lawmakers to strengthen what they believe to be weak gun laws and repeal the controversial 'Stand Your Ground' legislation . Dunn and his fianceé, Rhonda Rouer, were in Jacksonville on the night of the shooting to attend a wedding when they stopped at a Gate gas station in Baymeadows to pick up  a bottle of wine before returning to their hotel, authorities say. They parked their Jetta next to the red Dodge Durango SUV containing Davis and his three friends - Tevin Thompson, Leland Brunson and Tommie Stornes - who were listening to rap music on their way home after shopping at Black Friday sales at a mall. Dunn asked the teens to turn down the volume of the music, but, his attorney said, the teens turned up the volume, threatened Dunn and brandished a shotgun. Dunn grabbed a pistol from the glove compartment of his car and opened fire, before driving away, authorities say. Police said no weapon was found on the teens. Defense: Dunn's attorneys claim that their client felt threatened because he allegedly spotted the four black teens inside the SUV training a shotgun at him . Dunn was taken into custody at his oceanfront townhouse about 170 miles south of Jacksonville the day after the shooting. According to the lawyer, Dunn heard the teens in the SUV say: ‘Kill that mother******,’ ‘That mother****** is dead.’ Lemonidis said in the next moment, Dunn saw a shotgun coming up over the rim of the heavily tinted SUV containing four black men whose ages he did not know at the time. ‘But he knows a shotgun when he sees one because he got his first gun as a gift from his grandparents when he was in third grade,’ the lawyer said.","Michael Dunn, 47, faces first-degree .

The Oregon teen convicted of felony hit-and-run for mowing down and killing 6- and 11-year-old stepsisters in October was sentenced Friday to three years probation in an incredibly emotional court hearing. A tormented Cinthya Garcia-Cisneros addressed the parents of Anna Dieter-Eckerdt and Abigail Robinson in a Washington County courtroom last week and was no doubt deeply relieved when Anna's mother tearfully offered her forgiveness. 'I should have gone back. I should have thought about you guys,' the weeping teen confessed to Susan Dieter-Robinson and her husband, Abigail's father Tom Robinson. 'I should have gone back': At her sentencing on Friday, Cinthya Garcia-Cisneros (left) tearfully apologized to Susan Dieter-Robinson (right at center) for mowing over her daughter Anna (right at left) and stepdaughter Abigail (right at right) in October as they hid beneath a pile of leaves . Even the judge noted Garcia-Cisneros will likely be haunted by what she's done for life, but today she faces more pressing issues since her undocumented immigrant status could mean she'll be deported in light of her crimes despite being a beneficiary of the DREAM Act. According to the Oregonian, Judge Rick Knapp's decision to spare Garcia-Cisneros jail time was based on the words of Anna and Abigail's parents. 'I remembering thinking how horrible you would feel when you realized you hit two young girls,' said Susan Dieter-Robinson, mother to Anna and stepmother to Abigail. 'You were one block away, I’m sure, scared.' Unthinkable: Anna (right) died at the scene. Abigail (left) died later at a Portland hospital after Garcia-Cisneros accidentally ran them over in her boyfriend's SUV in October. She chose not to turn herself in or aid the investigation after she learned she may have killed the girls . Investigators picked up Garcia-Cisneros the day after the girls were killed. Here, an officer marks off the crime scene . Minutes after Garcia-Cisneros hit the leaves on her way home from getting fast food, her brother returned to the scene and saw a man standing over the pile, screaming. The man spoke to him briefly. The boy went home and told his sister she may have hit two children. Defense attorney Ethan Levi said Garcia-Cisneros was in a state of shock and denial after learning of the children and fixated on the possibility she wasn't the driver who struck them. Prosecutor Bracken McKey told jurors that Garcia-Cisneros' choice not to come forward was morally and legally wrong. 'I’m going to choose forgiveness,' said a weeping Dieter-Robinson. 'Cinthya, I forgive you, I do.' Nobody wins: Garcia-Cisneros (at right in her mug shot) was sentenced to 3-years probation for two counts of felony hit-and-run. she begged Dieter-Robinson and her husband and the rest of the girls' family for forgiveness and received it. However, she is an undocumented immigrant in the U.S. under the DREAM Act and could now face deportation at age 19 . 'The grief in this courtroom is palpable,' Judge Rick Knapp said at Friday's sentencing. 'I don't want to add to it' 'I don’t want you to spend any more time in jail,' Deiter-Robinson continued. 'Live a life of honoring my girls.' The . prosecution said the crash itself was an accident, but the woman was . required to return to the accident scene as soon as she learned of it. Her defense lawyer said the law doesn't say anything about the . requirements when a driver learns later about an accident. Authorities said the two girls were likely concealed by the leaves and not visible to Garcia-Cisneros. Anna died at the scene. Abigail died later at a Portland hospital. Before the sentence was read, Garcia-Cisneros--wearing shackles and orange prison garb--spoke once more. Authorities said the two girls ¿ later identified as stepsisters, 6-year-old Anna Dieter-Eckerdt and 11-year-old Abigail Robinson ¿ were likely concealed by the leaves and not visible to Garcia-Cisneros. But prosecutors successfully argued that the her crime began as she learned she may have hit the girls and still did nothing . Outgoing: Anna Dieter-Eckert was a first-grader at Dilley Elementary, where in the past few months she had made several close friends . 'You say you forgive me, and I hope that you do,' she said after offering ever more tearful condolences and apologies. 'I do,' replied Dieter-Robinson. The judge called the grief in the room 'palpable.' 'I don't want to add to it,' he said before handing down the relatively light sentence. The . judge had the option of imposing only probation or a maximum of three . years in prison. In addition to probation, the judge also ordered . Garcia-Cisneros to serve 250 hours of community service. An Immigration attorney said the woman will next be taken into federal custody on an immigration hold and she may be deported. Though . she has temporary permission to be in the country legally under the . federal Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, applicants in . that program cannot have certain criminal convictions.

Joan Mondale, the wife of former Vice President Walter Mondale, has died three days after entering a hospice care program at the age of 83. The coupleâ€™s longtime church released a statement announcing her move to end-of-life care on Friday, giving very few details about her condition. She entered the unidentified facility and the illness that led to her death has not been revealed. Back in the day: Joan Mondale, seen with her husband Walter at the Democratic National Convention in 1980, died Monday evening at the age of 83 . 'She is surrounded by her family and loved ones as her life on this earth moves peacefully to its close,' the statement announcing her move to hospice care read. 'Joan of Art': The former Second Lady was known for her work to increase arts appreciation . The statement was released by Westminster Presbyterian Church in Minneapolis, where the Mondales have been members for decades. Mrs Mondale, who was born in Eugene, Oregon and whose maiden name was Adams, worked at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts after graduating from college and met her future husband on a blind date that had been arranged through one of his law school classmates. The couple married in 1955 and had three children, one of whom died in 2011 following a battle with brain cancer. She built a reputation as a national cultural arts advocate while her husband was vice president, and was so passionate about the arts that she was nicknamed â€˜Joan of Art.â€™ . She herself was an avid potter when Walter Mondale was elected Jimmy Carter's vice president in 1976. During the Carter administration, from 1977 to 1981, she used her status to help cultivate a collection of American art that was stored at the vice Presidential mansion. When Walter tried and failed to win the presidency in 1984, the couple moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota and then later moved to Japan when he was appointed as the U.S. Ambassador. They lived in Japan from 1993 to 1996 and she took the chance to redecorate the American embassy during that time, filling it with American art and promoting better understanding between the two nations. They returned to Minnesota following the posting, and she has continued her work with the arts in her home state. Running partners: Joan and Walter Mondale later went on to go to Japan as he was appointed as the Ambassador to the country .","Joan Mondale's death was reported Monday evening, hours after news broke that she entered hospice care .

A northern Indiana teenager who pleaded guilty for a second time to conspiring to help kill a friend's stepfather got the same sentence on Monday that he received more than three years ago, but because of a change in Indiana law he could be released to a residential facility without ever serving a day in adult prison. Judge James Heuer gave 15-year-old Paul Gingerich a 30-year sentence, with the final five years suspended, which is the same sentence Gingerich received in November 2010 in the death of Phillip Danner at his home near Lake Wawasee, about halfway between Fort Wayne and South Bend. But the Indiana Court of Appeals threw out the first guilty plea and sentence, ruling that Kosciusko County Superior Judge Duane Huffer had rushed when he waived the case to adult court. Paul Henry Gingerich sits inside a room at the Pendleton Juvenile Correctional in 2012. Gingerich, now 15, was sentenced on Monday to 25 years under state supervision in the April 2010 death of Phillip Danner at his home near Syracuse . Defense attorney Monica Foster said Gingerich agreed to plead guilty in December because a new law that went into effect July 1 allows him the chance to avoid serving time in an adult prison. Gingerich currently is being held at the Pendleton Juvenile Correctional Facility. Foster and prosecutor Daniel Hampton disagreed on how long Gingerich will have to remain in a juvenile facility. Foster said he could be placed in a residential facility as early as this summer after receiving his high school degree, while Hampton said the earliest that could happen is after he turns 18. Both agreed that Gingerich, who has already served more than three years in custody, will remain under state supervision in some manner, in a maximum-security facility if he gets in trouble, or in a group home, community corrections, on probation or parole if he's well-behaved. Both said there will be another hearing after he turns 18. Gingerich apologized to Danner's family during a brief, tearful statement before being sentenced. 'f I could, I would change what was done,' he said. 'It is my actions that are responsible for your suffering. I'll have to live with that the rest of my life. I'm very sorry for what I've done. ... I know sorry isn't enough.' Before Gingerich spoke, Danner's sister, Kim Wilson, said the only apology her family had ever heard had come from Foster. She said they had never heard from Gingerich or his parents, but said she saw a videotaped interview with Gingerich's mother in which she repeatedly asked how this could have happened to her son. 'Paul, this did not happen to you,' Wilson said. 'You are not the victim.' Wilson said her family endures constant media reports that focus on Gingerich's young age at the time of the murder, but not on Danner, an active father and grandfather with many friends. 'I want you to know Phil was a good person. He did not deserve to die,' she said. Gingerich looked at her at times during the statement, and at other times stared at the table he was sitting at. She said she would forgive Gingerich, but said it would be easier if he apologized. Tough life: Gingerich now 15, has been described as a role model at Pendleton Juvenile Correction Facility where he is currently incarcerated . Foster told Wilson that Gingerich had written the family an apology letter after his first guilty plea, but the Correction Department would not allow him to send it. Danner's 15-year-old son pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit murder in September 2010 in exchange for prosecutors dropping charges of murder and aiding murder. He was sentenced to 30 years. Foster described Gingerich as teenager with above average intelligence who a psychologist said is less likely than the average juvenile defender to again break the law. 'He is attempting to rehabilitate himself,' she said. 'I think he's well on his way to rehabilitation.'","Judge James Heuer gave 15-year-old Paul Gingerich a 30-year sentence, with the final five years suspended .

Enjoying the area: Brown has been a longtime summer resident of the state but doesn't normally spend much time there in the winter .

While everyone else wore long-sleeved . t-shirts, 54-year-old Brown showed off his physique in spite of the . cold weather as the temperature ranged from 32 to 44 degrees throughout . the day.

Defeat: Elizabeth Warren bumped Scott Brown from the Senate seat in 2012 (seen here during the campaign) Competition: If he chooses to run in New Hampshire, he will be facing Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen, who has held the seat for the past two terms since 2002 . After winning a Massachusetts special election in 2010 following Senator Ted Kennedy's death, Brown left the Senate two years later when he was beaten by Democratic challenger, Elizabeth Warren. Warren is now seen as a Democratic rising star on the national stage, and the chances of being re-elected in her left-leaning state are fairly high. In turn, Brown has been spending more time at his vacation home in Rye, New Hampshire. Aside from the lovely scenery, it is also convenient that the state's Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen is up for re-election this year. While signs might be pointing to a possible senate run, Brown- who signed on as a Fox News contributor after being voted out of office- has kept hinting at his viability as a presidential candidate in 2016.

From the age of 21, he was forced to take a bucket back and forth to a tatttered water pump at Widow Croft Farm in Hollingworth, Greater Manchester, just so he could have a bath or pour himself a glass of water. But now, the 72-year-old has been connected to a water mains for the very first time, and celebrated by turning the tap, filling his kettle and making a cup of tea. Into the 21st century: Doug Goulbourne, 72, can now make himself a glass of water without having to walk to a water pump after almost 50 years without running water . Daily routine: He would have to take a bucket to the tattered pump if he ever wanted water . The farmer has been going back and forth to a tattered water pump in a ditch 50 yards away since his parents moved to the property in 1962. Now, after having to rescue unlucky frogs from the 166-year-old contraption at the break of dawn he  can enjoy quality H20 around the clock. 'I'm delighted,' said Mr Goulbourne, . who kept his bath full with water while the workmen from United Utilities dug around his . 84-acre farm just in case the supply ran out. 'Having . running water makes my life so much easier now. It's fantastic just . knowing when I turn on the tap - water is going to come out. Work: Mr Goulbounre, pictured working in the dairy,  moved to the farm in 1962 when he was 21-years-old . Property: The pump used on the farm in Hollingworth, Greater Manchester, was installed 166 years ago . Tough: The farmer has suffered many winters without any water at all, but can now enjoy H20 around the clock . 'It's a real pain having to thaw out your water supply every winter or worry about it drying up in the summer. I think it's marvellous now I have a mains supply and they say it is better water too.' Bachelor Mr Goulbourne inherited . Widows Croft Farm, built in 1837, from his father in the late 1960s . but he was happy to carry on using the well - which involved taking . water from a tank filled by gravity from water streams. He would wake up at 5.30am each day and get the water after he tended to his animals, including a pet cow called Susan, 60 cattle and four dogs. But . times were difficult when his rickety water pump, which channels water . from moorland streams, failed and he was left with no other . option but to fix it time and time again. Finally: He is now able to make a cup of tea by simply turning the tap and filling his kettle . Early rise: He would get the water after waking up at 5.30am each day to tend to his animals, which includes a cow called Susan, 60 cattle and four dogs . Despite the monotonous routine, he never thought about getting running water installed until the offer arrived. Under a new Â£3m scheme, United . Utilities have extended their water network to more remote parts of the . valley where the farmer lives, so supplies will be piped to him and more than . 30 other properties in the area. 'Having a well and no running water was like having a wooden leg,' said Mr Goulburne, who has not owned a working television for 14 years and builds . radios to communicate via Morse code with enthusiasts as far afield as . Spain and Croatia. Handed down: Bachelor Mr Goulbourne inherited Widows Croft Farm from his father in the late 1960s . 'If you've got one, you make do with it and carry on. The tank could pack up at any time and there would be no water to draw and I just to go without. 'It used to always seem to pack up on . Christmas Eve or Christmas morning. But when you're used to using . something you just carry on, it doesn't occur to you to change.' 'Now . it's going to make a tremendous difference. Some days I don't have the . energy I used to have. It's going to give me so much more time - I'll . feel ten years younger. 'It's . going to be lovely to have clean, clear water because there was a lot . of pollution in the other one. In spring I would get little frogs stuck . in the pump and I would have to pull them out. Now . the best thing is the water is just there. I don't have any problems . now. Now if I do have a problem I just ring the company up and they sort . it out. 'Some people . say, 'how can you live like that?' and I say 'well how do you think . people looked after themselves 1,000 years ago?' That's where people got . water from.' Content: Despite the monotonous routine, the farmer did not think about being connected to a water supply until he was offered one . He added: 'We are so lucky in this country having beautiful clean water. We should appreciate it more. But I'm tremendously grateful for what's happened. I have spent quite a lot of time this year messing about with the pump. 'Usually I have enough water to last through winter but this year I didn't have enough. It's run out through winter before and you just have to fix it.' Graham Dent, the United Utilities project co-ordinator said: 'It seems ironic that these properties are so close to our reservoir and yet they don't have mains water. 'We're going to put that right and there will be a lot of activity this autumn as we lay the new pipes. We've planned the work outside peak times and we are keeping the pipeline away from major highways as much as possible.' In 2010, only 30,021 out of more than 21 million households in England and Wales were not connected to the mains supply. Water began being pumped to British houses in the middle of the 19th century after people had previously relied on rivers and wells for their water.","Doug Goulbourne, 72, moved into his remote farm near Manchester in 1962 .

Bradley allegedly then fired shots at the front of the club before being caught and taken to a hospital. He's expected to survive. 'Alexander Bradley is again a shooting victim,' Foley said in a Twitter posting Monday morning. Fighting back: Alexander Bradley was shot at a nightclub over the weekend and then allegedly began shooting back. In his previous altercation with Hernandez, the NFL star allegedly shot him in the face causing Bradley to lose an eye . 'Multiple GSWs (gunshot wounds) to his leg. Major Crimes investigating.' Police haven't announced any arrests or a clear motive, though his connection to Hernandez has investigators suspicious that it may be tied to those charges. Bradley alleges in a Florida lawsuit that he lost an eye when Hernandez shot him outside a Miami club last year. Boston police have linked Bradley and Hernandez to a 2012 double killing, although no charges have been filed. Police believe Hernandez and Bradley were in an SUV when someone inside the vehicle fatally shot Daniel Jorge Correia de Abreu and Safiro Teixeira Furtado in Boston's South End, according to a search warrant filed by Bristol, Connecticut police. The warrant doesn't say who investigators believe pulled the trigger in the double killing or suggest a motive. No charges have been filed in the case. Twisted case: Hernandez, who is originally from and has close ties to Connecticut, is currently being held in Massachusetts on murder charges related to the death of semi-professional football player Odin Lloyd . Second time as a victim: Alexander Bradley, seen here in an October 2013 court appearance, claimed that the first altercation with Hernandez took place in Miami, Florida . The warrant sought recordings of phone calls made by Bradley while he was jailed in Hartford in October for failing to appear before a Massachusetts grand jury investigating the 2012 shooting. Investigators say they found the SUV wanted in the Boston homicides at the home of Hernandez's uncle in Bristol. Shady: The latest twist in the saga comes as prosecutors now say Carlos Ortiz  Ortiz is no longer a trusted star witness . Police say surveillance camera recordings show Hernandez and Bradley going into a Boston nightclub shortly after the shooting victims went into the club. The recordings also show Hernandez driving the SUV out of a nearby parking garage with Bradley as a passenger shortly before the shootings, police said. Hernandez is currently being detained on a murder charge in the death of Odin Lloyd, a semi-professional football player whose body was found June 17 near Hernandez's North Attleborough, Massachusetts home. Hernandez has pleaded not guilty. The Connecticut nightclub shooting is just the latest twist in the ongoing saga, as prosecutors announced on Friday that they no longer view their star witness as reliable. Carlos Ortiz, 27, who is charged with accessory to murder after the fact in the shooting death of Odin Lloyd, will no longer be called as a witness in Hernandez's murder trial at all. Ortiz was one of two men allegedly in the car with Hernandez before Odin Lloyd was shot to death. He was arrested last summer in connection to the murder and told police that Hernandez and another man, Ernest Wallace, 44, were outside their vehicle at the North Attleborough Industrial Park when Lloyd was shot five times. On trial: Prosecutors allege Aaron Hernandez has been speaking in code about the murder of Odin Lloyd to his cousin and his fiancee . Accused co-conspirators: Cousin Tanya Cummings Singleton (left) and fiancee Shayanna Jenkins (right) face charges for their involvement in the murder case, and are accused of receiving the coded messages . Ortiz said he was asleep in the . vehicle when he was awoken by the sound of gunshots, after which . Hernandez and Wallace returned to the car. He . also told police that he saw Hernandez carrying a handgun and mentioned . a 'flophouse' in Franklin which 'other football players used,' where . police recovered evidence including clothing and ammunition, according . to the Taunton Gazette. However, Ortiz has now changed his story to say that Hernandez was alone with Lloyd outside the vehicle. Prosecutors . also requested copies of Aaron Hernandez's phone calls from Bristol .

He did manage a few words yesterday - 43, to be precise - but Lynch has always been a man who believes actions speak louder than words. During the pre-Super Bowl Media Day, he managed six minutes on the podium answering reporters questions before bolting. Later, NFL media's Deion Sanders managed to corner him as he made his getaway and the two had a one-on-one in which Lynch made his feelings on idle chatter clear. 'I ain't never seen no talking winning nothing. Been like that since I was little. I was raised like that,' he said. 'I'm gonna get it. Don't need to talk about it.'

A two-year-old boy has died after his mother accidentally gave him liquid methadone that she stored in a Gatorade bottle, police have said. Aiden Goff died and two of his siblings were hospitalized after their mother, Jill Goff, mistakenly served them the powerful drug in a sippy cup at their home in Tooele, Utah on Friday afternoon. Methadone is a pain reliever that can . also be used to help recovering addicts through withdrawal symptoms and its side effects can mimic . heroine. Police believe she obtained the drug legally but they have not said why it was in liquid form or stored in a drink bottle. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Aiden Goff, right, has died after his mother Jill Goff, left, accidentally served him methadone . Police were called to the home at 6pm . on Friday when the 32-year-old mother found Aiden not breathing. Emergency responders tried to save him, but he died at the home. Later that evening, the boy's eight-year-old brother and five-year-old sister went to the emergency room and both tested positive for methadone, police told the Salt Lake Tribune. The boy had broken out in a rash and his eyes were swollen, according to a probable cause statement. Both of the children survived. The Goffs have five children in total. The hospitalized children told relatives and detectives that their mother had given Aiden a drink but he did not like it, the probably cause statement said. When he complained that he did not . like it, the mother gave it to the five-year-old, who agreed it was . disgusting. The eight-year-old then tasted it and he said it tasted like . medicine, the Tribune reported. Loss: Aiden drank from the cup his mother gave him on Friday afternoon. She was unaware that she had given him liquid methadone, which was being stored in a pink Gatorade bottle . Mother and son: Two of her other children also tasted the liquid but they survived after treatment. After realizing her mistake, Jill Goff put Aiden down for a nap but he did not wake up . 'The children had told us there was a sippy cup passed around between the three of them that mom had prepared for them and it didnâ€™t taste right,' Tooele Police Captain Paul Wimmer told KSL. Investigators believe that, rather than serving her child Gatorade, she inadvertently gave him methadone, which had been stored in the Gatorade bottle, Wimmer said. The mother then realized that she had switched the liquids and tried to get her two-year-old son to throw up, the statement said. She then gave him a bath and put him down for a nap. She told investigators that she did not call police because she was scared. A 14-year-old sibling went to wake Aiden, but he wasn't responsive. Goff called 911. She was arrested on suspicion of homicide, two counts of child abuse and endangerment of a child or vulnerable adult. She remained in the Tooele County jail. Mix up: She served him pink liquid methadone (left) - a strong pain killer that has similar side effects to heroin - that had been stored in a Gatorade bottle (right). It is not clear why the drug was stored in the bottle . Scene: Goff went for a nap with Aiden at the home, pictured, and later found him unresponsive . Police said Goff has no prior record and they believe she did not intend to kill her son.

As if they needed any more excuse, new research suggests men need their sleep if they’re to live a long life. Women, on the other hand, can live long lives despite poor sleep habits as long as they eat a diverse diet that includes vitamin B6 and plenty of vegetables. Vitamin B6 can be found in food such as meat, bananas, nuts, garlic and pistachios. Among other things, it allows the body to use and store energy from protein and carbohydrates. Good sleep patterns can help men live longer, but women will only benefit if they also have a diverse diet . The findings come from a study led by Melbourne-based Monash University which looked at how diet contributed to sleep quality and mortality among elderly men and women. Emeritus Professor Mark Wahlqvist from Monash University said sleep played a more important role in men’s mortality than women’s. 'Poor sleep has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality including obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and coronary heart disease,' he said. ‘We found that for both genders, poor sleep was strongly correlated with poor appetite and poor perceived health.' Women, on the other hand, can live long lives despite poor sleep habits as long as they eat a diverse diet that includes vitamin B6 and plenty of vegetables. Vitamin B6 can be found in food such as meat, bananas, nuts, garlic and pistachios . The amount and type of sleep a person needs changes as they get older. It isn’t always how long someone sleeps for that matters, but the quality of sleep. Someone's need for sleep can also change from day to day depending on the challenges face. In general, Bupa suggests adults need between seven and eight hours of sleep. However, some people can function after sleeping for much less time. Chris Berka, chief executive of  Advanced Brain Monitoring claims that a complete sleep cycle typically takes about 90 minutes. The rule of thumb is that you need 4-5 full sleep cycles. But there is no evidence that all seven to nine hours have to occur in a single bout. But the researchers also found a significant relationship between a diverse diet and sleep, particularly in women. ‘For women, good sleep only provides a survival advantage if they had a diverse diet,’ said Professor Wahlqvist. The study found women were almost twice as likely as men to sleep badly. Women who were poor sleepers had a lower intake of vitamin B6 from food than those whose sleep was rated 'fair' or 'good'. Fair sleepers had lower iron intakes than good sleepers. Both men and women could improve their outlook by eating a more varied diet, the research said. ‘Sufficient dietary diversity in men could offset the adverse effect on mortality of poor sleep while women need to make sure they are eating foods high in vitamin B6,’ said Professor Walhqvist. Participants in the study who did not sleep well were also less able to chew, had poor appetites, and did less physical activity. ‘These characteristics could contribute to lower overall dietary quality and food and nutrient intake, especially for vegetables, protein-rich foods, and vitamin B6,’ Professor Wahlqvist said. ‘They may also contribute to the risk of death, either in their own right or together with problematic sleep. Intervention focusing on education on healthy dietary practices in elderly people could improve sleep duration and provide more stable levels of health.’ The study was conducted on 1865 elderly men and women who were a part of the Nutrition and Health survey in Taiwan. The data was collected from 1999-2000.","Sleep plays a far more important role in men’s mortality than in women’s .

Low gravity could prevent the growth and spread of thyroid cancer cells, scientists claim. Experimental biologists have studied the spread of the disease using a ‘vomit comet’ – an airplane used to simulate microgravity and train astronauts. Dutch researchers subjected thyroid cancer cell cultures to 22 seconds of simulated microgravity using a parabolic flight and found that genes and proteins behaved differently. Dutch scinetists discovered that genes and proteins involved in malignant cell growth, changed in behaviour in microgravity conditions to become less aggressive that they would have been on Earth. A stock picture of magnified cancerous cells from the thyroid are shown . Cells in the human body normally grow within support structures made up of proteins and carbohydrates, which is how organs and tumours maintain their three-dimensional shapes. In lab settings, however, cells grow flat, spreading out in sheets. Because they don't duplicate the shapes they normally would make in the body, they don't behave the way they would in the body, either, which poses problems for scientists who study cancer by examining genetic changes affecting cell growth and development. But in space, cells outside a living organism . can still form three-dimensional groupings, or aggregates, that . resemble what they look like inside the body. Source: Nasa . Scientists from the Department of Oral Cell Biology, Academic Centre for Dentistry Amsterdam (ACTA), compared the results of the cancer cells to some that had spent 10 days aboard China’s Shenzou 8 spacecraft in 2011. They discovered that genes and proteins involved in malignant cell growth become less aggressive that they would have been on Earth, PopSci reported. ‘Gravity can lead to changes in cell proliferation, differentiation, signalling, and gene expression,’ they wrote in the study published in in the FASEB (Federation of American Scientists for Experimental Biology) Journal. ‘At first glance, gravitational forces seem too small to affect bodies with the size of a cell. Thus, the initial response to gravity is both puzzling and important for understanding physiological changes in space. ‘This also offers a unique environment to study the mechanical response of cells,’ they added. Experimental biologists have studied the spread of throid cancer using a 'vomit comet' ¿ an airplane used to simulate microgravity and train astronauts (pictured) While the scientists stopped short of recommending trips into space for cancer sufferers in their study, they think research into how the disease reacts in microgravity environments could unlock secrets of cells’ behaviour and ultimately lead to better treatments. Thyroid cancer is the 20th most common cancer in the UK, accounting for almost 1 per cent of all new cases, according to Cancer Research UK’s 2010 statistics. The U.S. National Cancer Institute reported there were 60,220 new cases of thyroid cancer in the U.S. in 2013 and over half-a-million people living with the disease in the country. Nasa explained that space provides ideal conditions for studying cancer cells, as cells in the human body normally grow within support structures made up of proteins and carbohydrates, which is how organs and tumours maintain their three-dimensional shapes. In lab settings however, cells grow flat and spread out in sheets. Because they don't duplicate the shapes they make in the body, they don't behave in the same way either, which poses problems for scientists trying to unlock their secrets. The aircraft gives its occupants and experiments the effects of weightlessness by following an elliptic flight path relative to the centre of the Earth. The aircraft (pictured) and its contents are in free fall at certain points of its flight path . However, in space, cells outside a living organism can still form three-dimensional groupings that resemble what they look like inside the body and scientists have been studying the effect of gravity on cells in microgravity conditions since the 1970s. Experiments on the space shuttles and the space station have shown changes in immune cells, including changes in cell-signaling cytokines, (small proteins secreted to mediate immunity and inflammation). The research indicates that the immune system is suppressed in microgravity. The architecture of cells changes in microgravity, with changes to cell walls, internal organisation and even their basic shapes. A series of experiments aboard the International Space Station examined changes to human colon, ovarian and other cancer cells. In one investigation, reduced production of cytokines in a human Muellerian ovarian tumour cell line were observed. Understanding changes in production of these proteins could help researchers comprehend the mechanisms of tumour cell development, Nasa’s scientists said.","Experimental biologists have studied the spread of the disease using a ‘vomit comet’ – an airplane used to simulate microgravity .

He and the school superintendent denied this baptism was related to the school or team in any way . ‘It is a violation of the Constitution for the Mooresville High School football coach to organize, lead, or participate in prayers or other religious proselytizing before, during, or after games and practices,’ Patrick Elliott, staff attorney for the Wisconsin-based nonprofit Freedom from Religion Foundation, wrote in a letter to the school district last fall. Superintendent Mark Edwards told the Charlotte Observer that he spoke with Capps at the close the football season and ordered him to stop all such religious activities. Edwards said Capps ‘understood’ he’d broken rules. The superintendent also said it was a mischaracterization to call the pictured incident a ‘team baptism,’ though he admitted it was held by a church to which many of the team’s players belong. Capps also appears in a video posted to YouTube in which he leads the team in thanking ‘the big guy.’ According to the letter from the Freedom From Religion Foundation, it was just one of many prayers led by Capps. ‘Students . have reported that Coach Capps frequently prays with football players . at team events and encourages them to go to church and to become . baptized,’ the letter read. The coach told the superintendent he’ll no longer pray with the team. ‘I think that would help resolve the issue going forward,’ Edwards told the Observer.

Mooresville native Belvil Sherrill agreed: . 'Being a Christian I have no problem with prayer in school or pray anywhere,' he said. 'If a coach was to lead a team in prayer, that's perfectly fine.

A Northern Virginia woman was horrified on Friday when she discovered a 4-inch bolt weighing several pounds had smashed straight through her dining room ceiling. Homeowner Abby Baker first believed the heavy hunk of metal was part of a burst pipe. But when workers came to assess the bolt, they pointed out the it probably fell from an airplane and hit the house, which sits directly in the flight path of the Washington area’s busy Dulles airport. Big bolt: A 4-inch, 2-pound metal object crashed through Abby Baker's Northern Virginia home on Friday and now the FAA has become involved . 'It could have hit my dog': The metal mystery object crashed through the roof and ceiling and right into Baker's dining room . Now officials are scratching their heads as they ponder what part of a plane the object comes from and whose aircraft is missing a bolt. Baker first saw the object and the fist-sized hole it left in her ceiling on Friday morning when she returned home from taking her child to school. ‘At first, I thought maybe a gas pipe burst or something, and then I found this piece here that I thought maybe was a pipe from a gas pipe,’ Baker told WRC-TV. ‘But when I had the gas company come out, they identified it as likely a piece of aircraft.’ With the location of Baker’s beneath the constant comings and goings of countless aircraft, the assessment made sense. But can an aircraft function without such a large bolt? Sky is falling? Baker initially believed the bolt came from a burst gas line but service workers say it's more likely from an airplane and now the FAA in on the case . 'It could have hit the kids in the elementary school': As authorities investigate the incident and identify which, if any, aircraft the bolt came from, Baker can't help but ponder 'what ifs' ‘We have no idea if it's an aircraft part or where it came from and we have to investigate it,’ said FAA investigator Barry Barbini, who was on the scene Saturday. According to Barbini, the National Transportation Safety Board was expected to send inspectors to Dulles airport on Monday and also analyse the mystery object. ‘We need to do some ground work to see if any airlines have reported any incident with one of their aircraft,’ Barbini said. Meanwhile, Baker just can’t help but ponder the ‘what ifs.’ ‘Had it been a little this way or a little that way it could have hit my dog. It could have hit the kids in the elementary school if they had been playing out over there,’ she said. ‘And that's scary to me for sure.’","Abby Baker lives beneath the Dulles Airport Flight path in Northern Virginia .

But such was the case at the weekend for Florida news reporter Josh Taylor, who was investigating an alleged property fraud in Sarasota. Taylor, who has worked at ABC for over ten years, was looking into a complaint made a 91-year-old woman who had rented a large home in Siesta Key for a family reunion that had been listed as having 11 bedrooms and being able to sleep 25 to 30 people.

But for one unlucky bird being caught by this huge falcon was no laughing matter as it quickly became lunch. The series of pictures documenting the puffin's final moments was taken by Audun Dahl at Hornxya, Varanger, in Northern Norway. A gyrfalcon, the largest of all falcon species, has been pictured grabbing a puffin in mid-air for lunch . Putting up a fight: Despite being less than half the falcon's size, the tiny puffin put up a brave fight . Predatory: The gyrfalcon feeds mostly on other birds, including puffins and gulls, but also small mammals . The 27-year-old photography guide from the island of Smola, Norway, runs a guiding company specialising in white-tailed eagles and hide photography. Audun said: 'The falcon broke the Puffins neck in just a few seconds, it seemed for me, that the falcon had full control of the situation all the time. 'I was so excited when shooting this incredible sequence - I just thought to myself I must keep calm and keep the gyrfalcon in focus. 'When shooting nature, anything can happen, the fight is natural behavior, so I did not feel sorry for the puffin. Final moments: Despite the struggles of its prey the falcon clings on with its powerful talons so there is no escape . No contest: Photographer Audun Dahl, from Norway, said the falcon was always in control . 'This happens every day in these remote cliffs - but this is the first time I have seen it happen so close, and I was very lucky I was at the right place, at the right moment.' The gyrfalcon is the largest of all falcon species, and it is also the only falcon to be a sea bird, spending as much as 40 days living on pack-ice and hunting gulls during the winter season. It can be found throughout most of the northern hemisphere, from America to Asia and Europe, and varies in appearance from all-white to dark brown depending on location. Dispatched: Using its beak the falcon breaks the puffins neck in mid-air before taking it away to eat . Lunch: The falcon flies off with its kill. The majestic bird was prized by the Vikings and is the symbol of Iceland . The birds were highly prized by the Vikings, and are thought to have been hunted and eaten for food, but also captured and kept as intimidating pets. The bird is also the national symbol of Iceland. Its prey includes other birds, from puffins to geese and gulls, and also small mammals such as lemmings, hares and voles. The species has also been spotted eating carrion meat, though this is rare. Meanwhile puffins are much smaller birds which usually nest in large colonies on cliff faces or in burrows, making them an ideal target for gyrfalcons which often perch in similar areas. The birds are known for their clown-like facial markings and bright beaks, and feed on small fish which they catch by diving into the sea.","A gyrfalcon has been pictured gabbing a puffin in mid-air .

A British oil worker is believed to have been abducted by gunmen in Sanaa - just hours after three explosions shook the Yemeni capital, underscoring the transitional government's feeble grip on security. The kidnapping followed that of a German by Yemeni tribesmen, who said on Sunday they had seized him two days earlier to press the authorities to free jailed relatives.

Meanwhile, a mortar bomb landed in a district that houses the French embassy and the home of former president Ali Abdullah Saleh. It damaged two cars - including the one above - and three buildings . Four people were injured in the mortar blast, which damaged three buildings and destroyed two cars, witnesses said. One resident reported hearing gunfire after the explosions, but details were sketchy. It follows a suicide bomb and gun attack that took place near the Defence Ministry in December last year - killing 52 people. The mortar bomb struck the home district of former president Ali Abdullah Saleh (pictured) Yemen, which neighbours oil giant Saudi Arabia and is home to an ambitious al Qaeda offshoot, has long wrestled with instability, internal conflicts and poor governance. Mass protests in 2011 eventually forced Saleh to end his more than three decades in power, but a political transition process has yet to calm a rebellion by Shi'ite Muslims in the north and a secessionist movement in the south. The Shi'ite Houthi rebels who had carved out a northern fiefdom before Saleh's fall have clashed in recent months with hardline Sunni Muslim Salafis and Hashid tribal rivals. Elsewhere, attacks blamed on al Qaeda-linked militants have grown bolder, raising fears of a total security breakdown in Yemen, a nation mired in corruption that has aggravated poverty. In Monday's kidnapping, four armed men forced the Westerner out of his car and into a waiting vehicle in Sanaa's upscale Hadda district, witnesses said. A police source said a report of the abduction identified the victim as a Briton. The source said the man worked for an oil services company. The British embassy in Sanaa and the Foreign Office in London had no immediate comment. It was not immediately clear if Islamist militants or tribesmen, who often use foreign hostages as bargaining chips to pursue demands against the government, were behind the attack. Efforts to stabilise Yemen hang on the post-Saleh transition and a national reconciliation conference that ended last month.

The bitterness and rancor stirred by Syria's civil war were on full display this week at peace talks in Switzerland - and not just in the closed room where rival delegations are seeking a way to end the three-year conflict. On Wednesday, the government's chief negotiator and his team were confronted by the mother of British doctor Abbas Khan, who died last month while in Syrian government custody. Fatima Khan had to be led away by United Nations security staff as she screamed at delegates. Fatima Khan (centre), the mother of British doctor Abbas Khan who died at 32 in a Syrian jail in disputed circumstances, is escorted away by United Nations security guards after trying to speak with members of the Syrian regime delegation in Geneva . ‘For God's sake, why did you kill my son?,’ Fatima Khan yelled as the team walked out of their hotel. ‘He was a humanitarian worker, he wasn't a fighter. Don't you have a heart?’ The family of Dr Khan,  who was found dead in his prison cell in Syria, believe he was sedated with drugs before being hanged by his captors. They fear his body had been flushed with fluids to cover up evidence of anaesthetics in his bloodstream. Although the results of a British post-mortem examination are not yet ready, a CT scan of Dr Khan’s body has apparently shown a cut in the femoral artery in one of his thighs, suggesting fluids were injected into his body. His family also told The Mail on Sunday the Syrian authorities embalmed the 32-year-old’s body against their wishes before returning it to them. Mrs Khan reacts as she is challenged by a pro Syrian government journalist, right . Anger: Mrs Khan is escorted away by friends after trying to speak with members of the Syrian regime delegation in the media area of the United Nations in Geneva . Dr Khan’s brother, Dr Shahnawaz Khan, 29, said he fears the embalming was a deliberate attempt by the regime to ruin any future post-mortem examinations as the process involves flushing a dead body with fluids to preserve it. The peace talks have led to many other confrontations as it’s the first time since the country devolved into its bloody civil war, that supporters and opponents of President Bashar Assad - many of them journalists - are meeting face to face. In the hallways of the U.N.'s European headquarters and on the manicured lawns outside, tempers have flared. Scuffles have broken out as journalists interrupt rival reports and government officials have received extraordinary public grillings. Forceful: Mrs Khan is interviewed by Syrian TV journalists at the Geneva talks . Dr Khan was on the verge of being released when his family were told of his death by what the Syrian government calls suicide and they say was political murder . More than 130,000 people have died since the uprising against Assad began in March 2011, and millions of people have been uprooted from their homes. The conflict has pitted neighbour against neighbour. People who were once friends have stopped talking to each other. Journalists who once worked together have been separated. Sectarian tensions, once tamped down under Assad's grip, have exploded into the open. Many journalists have been forced to leave the country, either thrown out by the regime or going into self-imposed exiled in order to continue their work freely. Many have switched jobs to work with opposition or government outlets. ‘It has been a rare opportunity to meet and get to know each other again,’ said Ibrahim Hamidi, a Syrian journalist working for the London-based Arabic regional newspaper, Al-Hayat. ‘It's unnerving for both sides.’ Family man: Dr Khan with his son Abdullah . Expert: Dr Abbas Khan in an operating theatre (location not given) In Geneva, anti-government activists accuse journalists supporting the regime of coming with a specific mandate to ask disruptive questions. And for government officials used to controlling the narrative back home, the experience has been frazzling. ‘The regime's delegation feel besieged here, they are on the defensive - clearly the weaker party,’ claimed Rima Fleihan, a member of the Syrian National Coalition opposition group. During an impromptu briefing at last week's opening session in Montreux, Syrian Information Minister Omran al-Zoubi was hounded by a widely known anti-government activist who pressed him on the government's indiscriminate use of barrel bombs against civilians in the hard-hit northern city of Aleppo. ‘Who is using barrel bombs in Aleppo?,’ Rami Jarrah asked. ‘I will give you the Google coordinates of ISIL headquarters in Raqqa. Why don't you bomb them?,’ he demanded, referring to the al-Qaida-linked Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, which hopes to turn the war into a regional conflagration that would allow it to take deeper root. Jarrah had the tables turned on him a day later, when an Assad supporter at a small but boisterous pro-government rally shouted at him: ‘You have destroyed Iraq, Libya. You will never do that to Syria!’ This was in reference to what many government supporters see as an opposition allied with the West. Pro-government journalists have capitalized on the fact that most members of the opposition's main Western-backed Syrian National Coalition are longtime exiles who have lived abroad for years, casting them as stooges of foreign powers. Murhaf Jouejati, a member of the group's negotiating team who lives in the United States and speaks Arabic with an American accent, was interrupted during a briefing by a journalist who demanded that he speak in Arabic. ‘We are Syrians and I need the answer in Arabic. Do you even know how to speak Arabic?’ she chided. Heartbreak: Mrs Fatima Khan at the funeral of her son at Regents Park Mosque in London . At one of his daily press conferences, U.N.-Arab League mediator Lakhdar Brahimi was peppered with so many questions from pro-government Syrian journalists that he quipped: ‘Is there anyone in this room who is not Syrian?’ On the live television position in the U.N. garden, with a peaceful vista of Europe's highest mountain Mont Blanc in the background, both sides make outrageous accusations, clearly playing to an international audience less familiar with the war. Opposition spokesman Louay Safi claimed people in the besieged city of Homs were eating ‘cats and dogs’ because the governments restrict aid convoys. Presidential adviser Bouthaina Shaaba accused extremists allied with the opposition of ‘burning people alive in ovens.’ In comparison, delegation members say the negotiations inside the meeting room with Brahimi have been more civilized, though sometimes tense. Outside, the delegations try not to cross paths, often milling about away from the podium, speaking to journalists or strolling around outside to avoid contact. On one occasion, al-Zoubi, the information minister, found himself standing back to back with an opposition delegate, as each talked to different reporters. Al-Zoubi was hastily led away by an aide. As bitter as things may be, some are hopeful the small encounters can eventually help begin a healing process for a ravaged country. ‘It's a learning process for both parties,’ Hamidi said. ‘And it sends signals to the Syrians back home.’","Dr Abbas Khan's family believe he was sedated with drugs .

These bizarre side-by-side toilets in a single bathroom were found by reporters just outside a press centre at the Olympics park in the Russian city. The Sochi organising committee initially denied any knowledge of the unusual twin conveniences, in a security screening point, and hasn't been able to say whether they were built on purpose or as a result of a plumbing error.

The toilet troubles have added an unexpected dimension to international perceptions of the sporting event, which Russian president Vladimir Putin had intended as a show of strength and prosperity on the international stage. They are the second set of double toilets to raise eyebrows in the West, after a BBC correspondent in the city found himself 'seeing double' in a cubicle at the Olympic park's cross-country skiing and biathlon centre. Moscow reporter Steve Rosenberg took the picture when he went to use the . bathroom during a site visit last month.

French president Francois Hollande is to use a pub lunch with David Cameron to pour scorn on Tory plans to claw powers back from Brussels. The two men are expected to clash during the meeting in the Prime Minister's local, with Mr Hollande claiming Britain will have to wait ‘years’ before it is able to rewrite the terms of its membership of the European Union. The row is likely to overshadow tomorrow's Anglo-French summit in Oxfordshire, which . comes just days after the president split from his partner following an . affair with an actress. Awkward: Downing Street insisted there would be no role for spouses when David Cameron hosts French President Francois Hollande for a summit this week . Mr Cameron and Mr Hollande will appear side by side at the summit at RAF Brize Norton in the PM's constiuency . tomorrow morning before continuing their deliberations in a traditional English pub. Mr Cameron and President Hollande will agree further defence . co-operation on the development of new armed drones. But ahead of the talks Mr Hollande’s spokesman said it was ‘very, very unlikely’ that any treaty changes will be in place before 2017, when Mr Cameron has pledged an in/out referendum on EU membership. And he said all the talk of a referendum would frighten investors away from Britain. In a briefing for journalists in Paris ahead of the summit, the President’s spokesman said any treaty change unlikely before 2017. ‘This doesn’t mean we won’t one day require treaties to be revised for the requirements of economic monetary union, but it is very, very unlikely this will be compatible with the British political calendar,’ he said. ‘It’s in our interests that Britain remains within Europe, but it is not by changing the treaties or rules will negotiate its place in the EU. It is in our interests that Britain remains within Europe but that cannot happen at the price of dismantling Europe.’ Happier times: Francois Hollande and Valerie Trierweiler on the night he was elected French president . The official went on to warn that if the next Government agrees to a referendum, companies will be less willing to invest in the UK as the date for the vote approaches. He said: ‘The more the question becomes concrete in British national debate, the more investors and the business community warn what a Britain out of Europe would mean. ‘When investors talk, they want to access the European market through the UK. This access presupposes following a certain number of rules to maintain balance in Europe. ‘If these rules are not wanted in the UK, it will no longer have access to [the European market].’ The French media said the Prime Minister would take the president to an Oxfordshire pub. To save his blushes, there will be a ‘no spouses’ programme – meaning Mr Cameron will not be accompanies by his wife Sam. Pub diplomacy: Tony Blair sought to win over French President Jacques Chirac in 2000 with a pint in the County restaurant in the Labour PM's constituency in County Durham ahead of a summit in France . In 2003 Mr Blair repeated the trick, taking US President George W Bush to the Dun Cow pub in his constituency . Unlike the French presidency, Downing Street has refused to confirm or deny any reports about what will be discussed at the summit. But French officials said the UK and France will deepen their co-operation on defence by developing a new generation of armed drones. They will sign announce that defence companies from the two countries will carry out a two-year study on building armed drones for their countries’ military, French officials said yesterday. The ‘entente frugale’ military agreement between France and the UK was first signed in 2010, as the two countries attempted to save money following the credit crunch depression. Tomorrow, the two leaders will say they have gone further and will work together on developing a Predator-type drone. At the summit at RAF Brize Norton, they will also announce greater cooperation on anti-ship missiles and underwater mine detectors.","Anglo-French summit to be held at RAF Brize Norton tomorrow .

Fatimah Lim is accused of stealing diamonds worth £12million from the ex-wife of the Sultan of Brunei . A female bodyguard stole rare diamonds worth £12million from the ex-wife of one of the world's richest men, replacing them for near-worthless replicas, a court was told. Fatimah Lim, 35, is accused of stealing two large diamonds from the safe at the London home of Mariam Aziz, a former wife of the Sultan of Brunei. She is accused of replacing the pear-shaped 12.71 carat blue diamond - valued at £7.6million - and a rectangular 27.1 carat yellow diamond - worth £600,000 - with replicas worth £150 each, to clear a gambling debt. The Singapore national is said to have stole the gems from her employer’s £1.7 million home in Kensington, West London, after duping her daughter into letting her borrow them for a few hours. She is also accused of stealing a £3.3 million diamond bracelet after Mariam Aziz gave it to her for safe-keeping while out gambling. When Miss Aziz wanted it back, Lim denied ever being given it and suspicion fell on a housemaid. Later she stole and sold the diamonds given to Miss Aziz by the Sultan of Brunei during their marriage, with the blue diamond being bought from the Hilton Park Lane jewellers in 1986, the court heard. The Sultan, one of the world’s richest men, and Miss Aziz, a former airline stewardess who is of Bruneian, Japanese and Scottish ancestry had four children during their 21 years of marriage. Gareth Patterson, prosecuting, said: 'The prosecution case is that this defendant breached the trust that was placed in her by her employer, Miss Aziz. 'These three items were a diamond bracelet, a large yellow coloured diamond and a large blue coloured diamond. 'It appears that the defendant may have decided to sell these diamonds, because she - the defendant - had been gambling and needed to clear her debts.' Isleworth Crown Court heard that after stealing the gems, Lim took them to a jeweller in Hatton Garden to sell, claiming they been a gift from Miss Aziz to her mother, who she claimed had been a PA to the sultan’s former wife. To cover her tracks she had fakes worth just £300 made and put these back into the safe at Miss Aziz’s home, it is claimed. The alleged theft was only discovered in December 2009 when Miss Aziz asked her adopted daughter, Afifa Abduallah, to take the diamonds, which had now been set in rings, back to the Hilton for resizing. Jurors heard Lim started working for Miss Aziz in 2003 firstly as a badminton coach, but that her role eventually evolved to that of a personal assistant and bodyguard to the mother-of-four. In her capacity she travelling between her boss’ houses in Singapore, or Brunei, or in London. Mr . Patterson added: 'The background, sadly, to this case is that Miss Aziz . came to consider the defendant to be one of her most trusted employees . and considered her essentially as a friend.' The . pair would visit casinos across the world, including the Clermont Club . in Berkeley Square and Les Ambassadeurs, near Park Lane and such was the . trust placed in her Lim 'was allowed to become a signatory on Miss . Aziz’s accounts'. If Lim reached her credit limit on any of her own accounts, she would be able to use Miss Aziz's. Lim, a former bodyguard to Mariam Aziz, right, the ex-wife of the Sultan of Brunei, left, is said to have duped the couple's daughter into letting her 'borrow' the diamonds, before selling them and replacing them with near-worthless replicas . It was at the Les Ambassadeurs casino in May 2008 that Miss Aziz gave her an eight-diamond bracelet worth around $5.5million dollars bought from Graff jewellers in Bond Street for safe keeping. Two or three weeks later the sultan’s former wife wanted to wear the bracelet, but that it could not be found, the court heard. Miss Aziz’s staff were questioned and Lim denied having ever been given the item. Instead suspicions were raised against another housemaid, jurors heard. However, Mr Patterson said that this housemaid claims that Lim had later come to her and said she knew someone who could make replica jewellery. Lim eventually took the bracelet, as well as another one, to a jeweller in London’s famous Hatton Garden. Giving her name as Sue, but later identifying herself, she claimed she had authorisation from her mother to sell the items. But Mr Patterson told the court that Lim’s mother had never worked for Miss Aziz and that this was just a story she had made up to 'cover her tracks'. It is alleged that she then played on her close relationship with Miss Aziz’s adopted daughter, Afifa Abduallah, who saw the two as 'best friends'. Twice she asked Miss Abdullah to borrow the diamonds as collateral on a property deal on the promise to return them in a short time. Mr Patterson said: 'In order to do that, what she did is she abused her friendship with the young and naove adopted daughter.' The second time when she asked for the same favour toward the end of the year she switched the diamonds with £300 replicas made out of cubic zirconia. She later sent Miss Abdullah Facebook messages asking her to keep it secret from her mother. When the thefts were discovered Miss Abdullah eventually told her mother what had happened and Lim was confronted by Miss Aziz’s nephew Idris Ja’afar in Brunei, the court heard. She initially denied being in London in December 2009, but 'came clean' when Miss Abdullah arrived at the meeting and asked 'if Miss Aziz might forgive her and pardon her'. However, Lim, of no fixed address, denies three counts of theft. The trial continues.","Fatimah Lim 'stole two rare gems and bracelet to pay off a gambling debt'

Heading home: Former French first lady Valerie Trierweiler pictured arriving at Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport after her humanitarian trip to India . It comes after the President of France effectively sacked her as First Lady on Saturday with a curt 18 word statement. Trierweiler wryly added the short statement amounted to nearly one word 'for each month together since his election'. She also claimed she was 'more disappointed than angry' about the break-up which came after Hollande was accused of having a two-year affair with actress Julie Gayet, 41. Trierweiler admitted to magazine Paris Match that she felt like she was 'falling from a skyscraper' when she first found out about Hollande's affair. She first said it was ‘like being hit by a high speed train’ and checked herself into a public hospital for eight days suffering from stress.

Nadine Dorries was among 28 MPs who gave relatives pay rises at the taxpayers' expense, as it was revealed she employed both her daughters in her parliamentary office at a total cost of up to £80,000. The Tory MP is one of 155 MPs - including five ministers - who employed family members last year at a total cost of up to £327,000 - all of it funded from the public purse. Ms Dorries, the MP for Mid Bedfordshire, boosted the salary of her daughter Philippa, 28, into the £40,000-£44,999 pay band from the £30,400 she was earning as a constituency caseworker.

MPs claimed a record £98million in allowances last year, according to figures from the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority - up from £95.4million in 2009. Cabinet minister Michael Moore, health minister Dan Poulter and foreign minister Alistair Burt were among other MPs revealed to have employed relatives in their parliamentary or constituency offices. Suspended: Nadine Dorries was briefly expelled from her party following her appearance on I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! in November . Ms Dorries - who repaid £3,000 in travel expenses last year after accepting that the claims were 'wrongfully made and should not have been allowed' - wrote on Twitter: 'I do employ my daughter.

She has also said that employing her daughter Jennifer as a caseworker provided 'value for money' as she worked weekends and could be relied on, and wrote on Twitter: 'Given the hours she works, she would argue, very strongly that she is on less than minimum wage and very abused' - adding a smiley face. Philippa Dorries left her mother's office last year and Jennifer joined soon afterwards, meaning they did not work for the 56-year-old MP at the same time. Ms Dorries, who was suspended from the party last year following a row over her appearance on the ITV reality TV show, has previously called for MPs' expenses to be abolished entirely. She announced yesterday that she has signed a six-figure deal to write three books about her upbringing on a Liverpool housing estate.

With that in mind, I thought all along it was very odd.’ Oh, and among all the toing and froing, McDermott’s squad acquired a new signing, but he has no idea who he is or which club he’s from.  And even less of an idea how the owner’s treatment of him will pan out. He added: ‘You have to be the owner of a club to bring new players in, so you surely have to be the owner to sack the manager. ‘It was very strange, to say the least. But questions like “Can I work with him if he does take over?” and “Will I still be in charge for Yeovil next Saturday?” are ones I just can’t answer. Honestly, I have no idea.’ Support: McDermott claimed he wants to stay at Leeds to repay support he has received from the fans . This famous old venue has had its moments down the years, from Peter Ridsdale’s well-fed fish to Ken Bates taking his seat in the directors’ box to chants of ‘Get out of our club’. This, though, tops the lot. Cellino was so confident his bid for a 75 per cent stake in Leeds had been rubber-stamped by  GFH Capital that he ordered McDermott’s sacking on Friday night, a move that caused uproar among fans who protested before, during and after the following day’s remarkable 5-1 win over Huddersfield. Such was the outpouring of  support for McDermott that  owners GFH felt compelled to issue a statement in which they ‘wished to make it clear that Brian McDermott remains first-team manager’. Ah yes, clarity. The one constant of a bewildering three days at a club who were Champions League semi-finalists little over a decade ago. Or perhaps not. Protest: A Leeds fan shows his discontent over a prospective sale of the club to Massimo Cellino . With Cagliari chairman Cellino still eager to seize a controlling interest, if he passes the Football . League’s fit-and-proper-persons test, who knows what the future holds for McDermott? He certainly doesn’t. He was forced to concede as much after fronting up at Leeds’ Thorp Arch training ground and fielding questions on the chaos. Fair play to McDermott. His livelihood is at stake, yet there was still a ready smile and a willingness to laugh at the sheer absurdity of it all. After entering the room,  taking his seat and waiting for the cameras to stop flashing, he was asked to recount the timeline since ‘things went a little awry’ last week. Still in charge: McDermott admitted people had told him to walk away from Leeds . ‘A little awry!’ he said. ‘I’m not sure I’d describe it quite like that. I got a call on Friday night to say I had been relieved of my duties and a letter was on its way to  confirm it. ‘Then on Saturday morning, I got another call from GFH to say that wasn’t the case. I then saw a couple of statements from the club on my iPad, and here I am now. I must say, I didn’t think, on Friday night, I would be sitting before you all today. 'And there are an awful lot of people who told me I shouldn’t be. ‘It’s just great to be back. I walked into the changing room and some of the lads gave me a look and said, “Where have you been all weekend?” You’ve got to laugh.’ Unpopular: Cellino is hoping to secure a 75 per cent takeover of Leeds . Less likely to amuse McDermott is interference, such as former Middlesbrough defender Gianluca Festa being told he can join the coaches in the dug-out and midfielder Andrea Tabanelli being recruited on loan from Cagliari behind his back. ‘I’ve had assurances from the owners about certain things and, for me, no-one goes in the dug-out or the dressing room without the manager’s OK,’ he said. ‘Festa was at the training ground this morning but I’ve only spoken to him once, when he first came over. 'I don’t know anything about the lad we are supposed to have signed and I’m not sure the League have ratified it yet. If they do, he’ll get an opportunity if we feel he is a player who can help us.’ As for the letter that was  supposedly dispatched last  Friday, it has still to drop through McDermott’s front door. Lost in the post, perhaps. It wouldn’t exactly be out of sync with the last few days, would it?

After the heartbreak of Paris comes an altogether different challenge for  England’s rugby players this weekend. As well as 15 Scotsmen thirsty for English blood there will be a muddy and maggot-infested  Murrayfield pitch one expert described as a ‘national embarrassment’. Stuart Lancaster’s England team will be looking to bounce back with an emphatic victory, but their efforts could become mired in the Murrayfield mud. Last autumn Scottish rugby admitted there was a serious problem, and that they were using garlic — the  vampire-killers’ weapon of choice — to combat the worms. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Lancaster and Robshaw reflect on France defeat . Mon Dieu! Despite a stirring comeback, England narrowly lost to France in their opening Six Nations match in Paris . Scot to trot: England coach Stuart Lancaster needs his team to bounce back when they face Scotland at Murrrayfield . The culprits — nematodes or, more commonly,  roundworms —  are not terribly partial to garlic. ‘It doesn’t kill them,’ said another expert, ‘but it does p*** them off enough to send them deeper into the soil.’ In 2014 there really is no excuse for the difficulties England might encounter if the Murrayfield pitch does quickly resemble a 1970s Match of the Day mud heap. Nobody is accusing the Scots of foul play but England’s World Cup-winning forward Ben Kay believes the poor pitch could be ‘a leveller’, and therefore to Scotland’s advantage against a visiting side that would expect to be stronger in the scrum and faster, more powerful and more skilful with the ball in hand. Will the worm turn? SRU Ground Staff are working round the clock to get the Murrayfield pitch ready for the Calcutta Cup game . Parasite: The poor pitch can be blamed on the nematode (L), and an example of damage it can cause to plant roots (R) ‘If you look at England’s front row, Dan Cole and Joe Marler are very much into the power scrummage,’ said the former lock. ‘They prefer a straight pushing contest to the traditional dark-arts encounter. Meloidogyne minor is a nematode, a type of worm, that has infested the Scottish turf. Less than 1mm long, it is a parasite that feeds off the roots of plants, destroying them in the process. It was identified in 2007 in the Low Countries, where it damaged potato crops, before making its way to Britain. Golf courses have been affected, with yellow-brown patches of grass the  tell-tale sign, but now the pests have wormed their way into a stadium. ‘But if you can’t get traction because the pitch is cutting up, you have a problem. The Paris pitch isn’t great either and Cole suffered against the much shorter Thomas Domingo at the weekend. ‘If you think of England’s defeats at Murrayfield they were often on wet, muddy pitches. ‘Power runners don’t have the contact with the ground to break through and the players with skill don’t have the same confidence underfoot. England won’t use it as an excuse but they would prefer a fast, firm track.’ It was in September, before Scotland played Japan, South Africa and Australia on a dreadful surface, that Scottish rugby first acknowledged there was an issue. Mark Laidlaw, SRU director  of management services, spoke  of ‘an excessive build-up of  nematodes which have caused  significant root damage’. He also warned that the surface ‘can weaken under the significant  pressure exerted by scrums’. Root of all evil: One expert has described the Murrayfield pitch as a 'national embarrassment' Leveller: The power of England's front row Dan Cole (R) and Joe Marler could be negated by the poor pitch . Laidlaw then said experts had been called in, using techniques that included the spraying of  garlic, and conceded it could take weeks to sort out. By January 13, however, a Scottish Rugby Union statement suggested little progress had been made. The pitch, it said, ‘is a matter of understandable concern’. Edinburgh club games were moved to another ground so that England will be the first opponents to play on the pitch this year but yesterday Scottish Rugby admitted to Sportsmail that, even now, ‘the pitch is not in the pristine condition we enjoy normally at Murrayfield’. Ground staff have been working to improve the situation but the idea that Scottish Rugby has in some way been unfortunate, that this infestation is a freak occurrence, is misleading. Bright idea? Scottish rugby has been using lights to combat the problem, but that could help pests flourish . Bad start: Stuart Hogg (R) and Scotland were beaten 28-6 by Ireland in their opening Six Nations game . Most pitches in world sport will have some form of pest problem. In recent seasons Manchester City have had to use garlic spray and Arsenal’s playing surface, widely considered the finest in the Barclays Premier League, is believed to have a nematode problem. ‘There are thousands of different types of nematode and some are better than others,’ said one expert, ‘but the key is how you treat them and I’d question some of the advice they might have had up at Murrayfield. ‘They’ve been using lights on the pitch and that does promote grass growth. But, and I have to say I don’t know what kind of nematode they have, lights can also create a warm, bright environment that enable these pests to flourish. ‘There are different solutions but in 2014 you can see that the way forward is to introduce a mix of natural grass with artificial. England did that at Twickenham, as have the Irish at the Aviva.’ Grounds for complaint: Manchester City's Etihad Stadium is one of several Premier League pitches that have suffered pest problems . As part of their recent £70million redevelopment of Twickenham, the RFU invested in a state-of-the-art DESSO ‘hybrid grass’ pitch that was laid on top of 20 miles of new undersoil heating pipes in August 2012. The same surface is also found at the Aviva and at a number of leading  Premier League football clubs, including Arsenal, Tottenham, Manchester City and Liverpool. Cardiff City have an excellent  DESSO pitch, too, and yet the Welsh Rugby Union are still  undecided as to the best way forward for the Millennium Stadium. In the meantime, RBS 6 Nations rugby suffers because of poor pitches . . . as do the teams who want to play with power and a more expansive style. After the defeat in Paris, England have enough on their plates without mud, maggots and garlic!","England meet Scotland in their second Six Nations game on Saturday .

A French corporal who served with British soldiers in Afghanistan and admitted to eating the tongue and heart of a 90-year-old man had post-traumatic stress disorder, it has been claimed. Jérémy Rimbaud, 26, is said to have admitted breaking into the home of Lépold Pédébidau and using an iron rod to beat him over the head before cutting out parts of his body with a penknife. Cooked meat found on a plate with white beans was confirmed by forensic experts to be human, following the incident in Nouilhan, south-west France, on November 15 in the hamlet of 200 people. Corporal: French soldier Jérémy Rimbaud had been serving in Afghanistan in a tank regiment (file picture) The attack has drawn comparisons to Hannibal Lecter in the 1991 film Silence Of The Lambs. The character, played by Anthony Hopkins, ate human organs ‘with some fava beans and a nice Chianti’. The son of Mr Pédébidau was alerted to what had happened by the flames coming from his father’s house nearby - which was set alight by Rimbaud following the attack, according to investigators. Rimbaud - who had been serving abroad in a tank regiment with British and US soldiers - is accused of attacking another man in France by hitting him against a tractor, reported The Daily Telegraph. The soldier allegedly told police he was 'acting on messages in his head' - and is set to face trial next year over charges of murder, violating the integrity of a corpse and attempted murder. Soldier: Rimbaud was said by a regimental source to have 'posed no problems during his stint' in Afghanistan from December 2010 to June 2011 (file picture) Rimbaud was said by a regimental source to have ‘posed no problems during his stint’ in Afghanistan from 2010 to 2011 - but has now been moved to a high-security unit for dangerous psychopaths. He left the army just nine days before allegedly committing the attack - and France Bleu Béarn cited a prosecutor as confirming that military doctors had diagnosed him as suffering from PTSD. PTSD is a reaction to a traumatic event where people can see they are in danger, or where they see other people dying or being injured in circumstances out of their control. Many victims of serious accidents, military combat, terrorist attacks, disasters and life-threatening illnesses have been diagnosed with suffering from the condition.","Jérémy Rimbaud 'cut out parts of 90-year-old man's body with penknife'

A microchip developed by scientists has restored the sight of nine blind people suffering from a  degenerative disease after it was inserted into their eyes. Once positioned at the rear of the eyeball, the implant restored functional vision to the patients born with the hereditary condition retinitis pigmentosa (RP). The 3mm chip may provide the 15 million people left blinded by the disease a means of partially restoring their vision. X-ray: Scientists at Germany's Tubingen University placed the 3mm chip at the rear of the eyeball of patients suffering from retinitis pigmentosa (RP) The tiny implant, developed by scientists at Germany's Tubingen University, is placed below the surface of the retina where it electrically stimulates optical tissues. In the latest trials, described in the Royal Society's biological research journal Proceedings B, most of the patients involved were able to recognise facial expressions. They could also distinguish objects such as fruit on a table and read road signs. Sight sharpness for two of them also surpassed the visual resolution achieved in earlier human trials involving 27 patients. Professor Eberhart Zrenner, of Tubingen University's Institute for Ophthalmic Research, said trials  'exceeded expectations' He said: 'As physicians we are constantly seeking out the best treatment options for our most in-need patients which most definitely includes those suffering from advanced-stage retinitis pigmentosa. Stimulant: The tiny implant was placed below the surface of the retina where it electrically stimulates optical tissues . Blind: RP is a disease that mainly affects the retina, specifically, the photoreceptors in the macular layer, which slowly degrade until the patient goes blind . 'This research provides additional evidence our sub-retinal implant technology can help some patients with retinal degeneration regain functional vision and does so in a way that does not require externally visible equipment.' RP is a disease that mainly affects the retina - specifically, the photoreceptors in the macular layer, which slowly degrade until the patient goes blind. Although the disease is incurable, the nerves of the retina remain functional in one bright spot. If these nerves can be stimulated then some form of vision might be recovered. The light-sensitive, externally powered microchip is surgically implanted beneath the retina and into the macular region. This is the area of the eye where clear images are formed in normal-sighted individuals. The chip is made up of 1,500 pixels each with its own amplifier and electrode for stimulating the retinal nerves. Improvement: In the latest trials, described in Royal Society's biological research journal Proceedings B, most of the patients involved were able to recognise facial expressions . In addition there are 16 electrodes to stimulate the nerves directly - producing some degree of artificial vision in the form of lines and colours the patient learns to interpret. Walter-G Wrobel, chief executive of Retina Implant AG in Germany, which has manufactured the implant, said: 'The continuation of our trial is the next milestone in our quest to provide RP patients living in darkness with a treatment option. 'We are continually humbled by the 36 patients we've implanted so far and their willingness to participate in this ground-breaking research.' David Head, chief executive of RP Fighting Blindness, said: 'As a leading relevant patient organisation in the UK we have been watching Retina Implant AG's research with great interest. 'The results published today show definite promise to one day restore functional vision to patients with advanced-stage retinitis pigmentosa.'","The implant partially restored vision in retinitis pigmentosa sufferers .

The organizers of a summer camp based on ‘The Hunger Games’ had to rethink the event after becoming increasingly concerned about the levels of violence that the children taking part in the ‘fun activity' were talking about carrying out. The hugely popular books and movie depict a teen girl's struggle in a post-apocalyptic future that pits teen against teen, fighting like gladiators in mortal battles. The Country Day School in Largo, Florida, decided to host a Hunger Games-themed week-long summer camp and quickly filled all 26 slots. Organizers of a 'Hunger Games'-themed summer camp had to rethink their idea about being concerned about the outpourings of violence from the children taking part . When the Country Day School in Largo, Florida, decided to host a Hunger Games-themed week-long summer camp it quickly filled all 26 slots . But organizers admit they were surprised about the expectations of the children attending the event. The Tampa Bay Times interviewed participants who spoke of relishing competing in a real-life Hunger Games tournament with a fight to the ‘death.’ ‘If I have to die, I want to die by an arrow,’ one participant, Joey Royals, told the newspaper. ‘Don't kill me with a sword. I'd rather be shot.’ Susan Toler, a clinical psychologist specializing in children's issues, described the idea of the camp as ‘unthinkable.’ A child psychologist has described the idea of the camp as 'unthinkable' The kids took part in four different events to test their intellect, accuracy, balance and teamwork . She argued that when children read the books or watch the movie they're observers and removed from the killing. ‘But when they start thinking and owning and adopting and assuming the roles, it becomes closer to them,’ she said. ‘The violence becomes less egregious.’ Camp organizers initially believed they could cut out the violence by having the kids pull flag belts from each others waists rather than hurting each other. But they admit that once the event was underway they grew concerned about the violence that the kids were expressing. Half-way through the week-long event the organizers decided they needed to change and focus more on team-building activities. More than 36 million Hunger Games books have been sold in the U.S. and the first movie, starring Jennifer Lawrence, grossed $700 million worldwide . Instead of ‘killing’ each other by taking flags, the campers would instead ‘collect lives.’ Whoever had the most flags would win. When head counselor Lindsey Gillette told the campers about the rule change she explained it was so that no one would get out early and have to sit on the sidelines. In the end the event proved a success and great fun for the kids who took part in four different events to test their intellect, accuracy, balance and teamwork. The Hunger Games trilogy of books, written by Suzanne Collins, has sold more than 36 million copies in the U.S. alone. The first movie, starring Jennifer Lawrence, has grossed nearly $700 million worldwide and the next movie ‘The Hunger Games: Catching Fire’ is out later this year.

Rosie, 24, died six hours after her baby was born. Throughout her pregnancy doctors had insisted she was suffering labyrinthitis, an inner ear infection. Mother Lesley, 57, together with sisters Ruth, 30, and Joanne, 28, took the agonising decision to allow Rosie's organs to be donated and eight people's lives were saved as a result.

Throughout her pregnancy doctors had insisted she was suffering labyrinthitis, an inner ear infection . Mrs Kremer, from Penrith, Cumbria, who is bringing up grandson Bobby, says she received a 'massive boost' when a three-page letter arrived from the anonymous recipient. It tells how the married mother-of-two's health had been deteriorating for 15 years before Rosie saved her life. It was quickly followed by messages of gratitude from her daughter and husband. She said: 'I absolutely bawled my eyes out when I got them, all of the family did. 'It made it seem real and it was lovely. For somebody to say ""I'm alive because I have been given your daughter's kidney"", was just amazing. 'It is a massive comfort to know she has had her life back and I'm so glad. She seems like such a nice person.' Mrs Kremer says she received a 'massive boost' when a three-page letter arrived from the anonymous recipient . The letter says: 'I was so frightened but it's a strange feeling knowing that some kind-hearted person had made the choice to help a stranger and I was that scared but so, so grateful. 'What a testament to this wonderful woman to want to help others this way. 'Since the transplant, my life has changed so much and my outlook on life is more positive. 'I have far more energy, chores are manageable and I'm awake for long enough to find out what's happening in my children's lives. 'I remind myself every day how lucky I am and try not to allow myself to get low or angry about the unimportant things.' The anonymous mother signs off by vowing to take the very best care of Rosie's gift. She says: 'I now have a life back that I had forgotten I had. 'The illness kind of creeps up over the years and you forget what you were able to do. 'I'm doing my very best to look after my wonderful, unique gift your loved one has shared with me and I intend to continue to do so. 'Again, thank you so much and I thank your special lady, who is in my thoughts every day.' Mrs Kremer agreed for her daughter's heart, lungs, kidneys, pancreas, liver, stomach and bowel to be donated following her death on May 29, 2012, as a tribute to her late husband, Peter, who died of cancer 11 years ago. He had always wanted to be a donor but was unsuitable due to his illness. In September, she accepted the Order of St John Award on behalf of Rosie which recognised her gift and she believes it is only Bobby and the organ donation which has kept her grief from becoming too much. She said: 'It is a positive at a time when we need as many positives as we can get. 'It is difficult to believe I am not going to see her again. The whole process with organ donation was massively comforting. 'She died, but at the same time something amazing was happening. It got us through those days, otherwise I don't know how we would have coped.' In Scotland and England, people must choose to join the Organ Donor Register but in Wales a new law which comes into force in 2015 will mean people will have to opt out. Mrs Kremer has joined the calls for it to be introduced in England. She added: 'I want to get people to think about joining the Organ Donor Register and it is an important time to show how worthwhile it is.'

She says Rosie lost two stone during pregnancy, was violently sick, slurred her speech and started to lose coordination of her limbs. Yet she says that at no point during the last two months of her life did any of the 23 doctors who saw her indicate that she was gravely ill. Lesley said she later learned that even an hour before her death Rosie could have made a full recovery if her condition had been correctly diagnosed and fluid had been drained from her brain. Mrs Kramer is now suing North Cumbria University Hospitals NHS Trust, which manages Cumberland Hospital, in Carlisle. Rosie, who worked as a nursery nurse, and lived in Penrith, began suffering a loss of appetite, headaches, dizziness and sickness, early on in her pregnancy. She was declared brain dead at 10.30am on 29 May 2012. Less than six hours earlier, at 4.30am, doctors delivered her baby boy, who she'd already named Bobby Peter, at 29 weeks. He weighed 2lb 14oz. Rosie had been transferred to Newcastle. Mrs Kremer agreed for her daughter's heart, lungs, kidneys, pancreas, liver, stomach and bowel to be donated following her death as a tribute to her late husband, Peter, who died of cancer 11 years ago . Lesley said: ""The care she received was appalling. There was no joined-up care. She was sent home twice from hospital. 'There was a note somewhere about cranial pressure, but despite all her symptoms nobody ever diagnosed a tumour. They weren't looking at the overall picture. 'Towards the end she was crying in pain and begging to die. 'Even then nobody was prepared to believe it was anything other than labyrithitis. 'I just kept asking people to help her. She became a zombie, she said the pain was so bad she wanted to die. 'Rosie had had a lot to deal with. She lost her dad to cancer when she was 14, and was very badly affected by it. 'Yes, she was drama queen, and she was a bit of a hypochondriac and she was scared that something would happen to her.' Rosie spent the last five weeks of her life in bed, unable to sit up or use her hands. A CT scan carried out after brain death revealed a very large brain stem tumour on the right side. Mrs Kramer said: 'I honestly didn't know what was the matter, but everyone seemed convinced she was just having a bad pregnancy. 'It didn't have to kill her. If somebody had spotted it she would have been fine, she would have recovered.'","Rosie Kremer, 24, died from an undiagnosed brain tumour .

Breakthrough: Scientists have developed a way of tracking tumours which have absorbed glucose . Chocolate, fizzy drinks and other sugar-laden foods could soon be used to detect cancer. Scientists have developed a technique that identifies the disease by tracking how sugar is absorbed by the body. Malignant tumours consume much more glucose – a simple sugar – than healthy tissues in order to feed their rapid growth. By adjusting an MRI scanner to look for glucose uptake, researchers at University College London discovered tumours glowed brightly during imaging, after something sweet had been consumed. The breakthrough provides a safer and simpler alternative to standard radioactive techniques, and could be available in as little as 18 months. Due to the need for radiation, the current method of scanning is not recommended for pregnant women and children, and only available at a limited number of larger hospitals and specialist centres. In contrast, MRI facilities are commonplace, meaning less travel for patients. And as there are no adverse effects from the technique, it can be used on a frequent basis to track whether a cancer is responding to therapy and tailor a patient’s treatment. As well as being cheaper and safer, the new method also raises hopes of improved survival rates. Senior author Professor Mark Lythgoe, director of UCL’s Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging (CABI), said the results had been unexpected. He said: ‘I certainly didn’t believe it as possible to fine tune an MRI scanner to pick up glucose movement even 18 months ago. But our research proves it can be done. ‘It can be done after consuming a sweet drink, like a cola or a fruit juice, or food. We can detect cancer using the same sugar content found in half a standard sized chocolate bar.’ In the study, published in the journal Nature Medicine, the team tracked tumours in mice with bowel cancer. They found the cancerous growth was detectable by an MRI scanner following glucose ingestion. The method has also been trialled on a handful of cancer patients with early signs of success. He said: ‘It was promising. You could see the uptake of the glucose in the area around the tumour.’ Unlike the current method of scanning, known as positron emission tomography (PET), which requires a trace amount of a radioactive substance to be injected into a patient, the new technique is needle free. ‘Effectively you don’t even have to give a patient an injection, as sugary food is absorbed so quickly, so it will be good news for those who don’t like needles,’ said Professor Lythgoe. Alternative: MRI scans are a safer and simpler method of detecting tumours than standard radioactive techniques . He added: ‘As for PET, there is always a small risk associated with anything involving radioactivity. So it can only be used sparingly, and is not suitable for pregnant women or children. ‘Too much radiation can damage DNA, and can either result in cell deaths or some cellular damage which can lead to secondary cancerous growths. ‘But with glucose scanning, there are no adverse effects, so it can be carried out much more often. If a doctor wants to follow up how a cancer is responding to treatment then they can scan the tumour on a weekly, or even a daily basis.’ Lead researcher Dr Simon Walker-Samuel, also from CABI, said the newly-developed technique used radio waves to magnetically label glucose in the body. ‘This can then be detected in tumours using conventional MRI techniques,’ he said. ‘It could offer a cheap, safe alternative to existing methods for detecting tumours, which require the injection of radioactive material.’ Clinical trials are now taking place, said Professor Lythgoe, who added: ‘We don’t have to refine the technique, as it stands it works. In a year’s time, we will be able to see hospitals picking it up.’ Dr Kat Arney, Cancer Research UK’s science communications manager, said: ‘Researchers have known for many years that cancer cells produce energy and use sugar slightly differently from healthy cells. ‘This exciting experimental scanning technique, suggests that regular, non-radioactive glucose can be used to detect bowel tumours in mice. It’s got the potential to become a safer, cheaper way of diagnosing and monitoring cancer, so the next step is to test it in patients – using controlled doses of pure glucose rather than sweets or chocolate -  to see how well it works in the clinic.’","Malignant tumours consume more glucose than healthy tissues .

Energy bills will still be higher than last winter, even after the government agreed cuts to controversial green levies which will save customers £50. Most of the Big Six had already announced rise of more than £100 this winter, before ministers moved to reduce the impact of government schemes designed to help the poor and vulnerable insulate their homes. Now British Gas has said it will cut bills by £53 in January, SSE bills will fall by £50, while EDF said it would hold prices until 2015, but ministers admitted prices could still rise again. Checking the bill: Details of handouts of up to £1,000 for homeowners to spend on energy-saving measures have been revealed (file picture) Chancellor . George Osborne has sealed a deal which will see the taxpayer shoulder . the cost of some schemes designed to help the poor and vulnerable . insulate their homes. Ministers stress that they have never promised to cut bills overall, insisting they can only act to reduce the costs of government policy. The taxpayer is to pick up part of the cost of environmental programmes in a package of measures to be unveiled by the Chancellor in Thursday's Autumn statement. They again dismissed Labour's promise to freeze bills as a 'con' because it is impossible to control global energy prices. The Government is cutting the cost of the energy company obligation (ECO), an insulation scheme delivered by major energy suppliers, in a move that should shave £30-£35 off bills, on average, next year. The Department of Energy and Climate Change also announced it is establishing a rebate, saving the average customer £12 on their bill for the next two years. Electricity companies will also take voluntary action to reduce network costs in 2014-15, funding a one-off reduction of around £5 on electricity bills. In addition, energy firms will be given two years longer to hit targets on the insulation of homes, enabling costs to consumers to be spread out. BRITISH GAS .

Winter 2013 price rise: Did not announce a price rise at the same time as the other Big Six . Energy Secretary Ed Davey said: 'Consumers are the ones who are winning today with an average of £50 off household energy bills, we’ve managed to do that by protecting the fuel poor… and we’ve done that by maintaining our green energy policies.' He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'One thing I think people have missed a bit is our very fierce competition policies. 'We’ve been working with Ofgem to increase competition in the retail sector. Which is why we’ve seen a lot of new firms come to supply energy. 'Labour reduced the number of firms in their time – Ed Miliband and Labour reduced the number of firms and created the Big Six. 'The Big Six are Labour’s creation. Under the Coalition we’ve seen a whole group of new people coming in to compete and winning customers off the Big Six. 'The Big Six may not like that, but this Government is in favour of competition.' But he later admitted that if wholesale prices rise, costs to customers will go up again. 'As the major energy companies have now confirmed there will be no need for price rises in 2014 unless of course there is a major change in wholesale or network costs,' he told MPs. Today the firms gave details of how the savings would be passed on. Npower said it would reduce its bills and is calculating what the saving will mean for customers. British Gas put up electricity prices by 10.4 per cent and gas by 8.4 per cent two weeks ago. But today it said it would roll back some of those rises, cutting the average dual-fuel bill by £43 and reducing the Warm Home Discount scheme by £12. Managing director Chris Weston said: 'British Gas is pleased to be cutting energy bills by an average of £53 from January 1. 'We've been able to do this because the Government has committed to making changes to the environmental and social obligations that are paid for through energy bills. These changes will now allow us to help more people at a lower cost.' Npower said it would pass on the savings, and promised not to push up prices again before spring 2015. Paul Massara, CEO at RWE npower, said: 'As a result of this announcement we will reduce our bills. 'We are currently calculating how large this reduction will be, and can assure our customers that it will fully reflect the reduction in the costs to our business. 'In addition, in order to give our customers greater certainty with their household budgets, we don't plan to increase energy prices before spring 2015, unless there are increases in wholesale energy costs or network charges.' Scottish & Southern Energy said it expects a saving for the typical dual-fuel customer of around 4 per cent before the end of March, equivalent to a saving of around £50 for a typical dual-fuel customer. EDF said its ‘decision to hold back the full impact of rising costs’ earlier this month by implementing lower rise than competitors had been ‘validated by the conformation that the Government will take action on energy changes’. ‘Customers should expect other energy suppliers to follow EDF’s lead by significantly lowering their prices,’ he said. Preview: Ahead of his Autumn Statement this week, Chancellor George Osborne gave details of reforms which he said would see £50 shaved off energy bills . Ministers have been scrambling to find a way to deal with rising energy costs since Labour leader Ed Miliband promised to freeze bills for two years if he wins the 2015 election. David Cameron dismissed the plan as a 'con' but action to reduce the cost of gas and electricity proved popular with voters. The government focussed on the impact of government policy, in particular to green levies which are added to bills used to fund schemes to make homes more energy efficient. Ministers hailed today's deal as a 'serious, . workable package which would save households around £50 on average'. But Labour's shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint said: 'If . David Cameron and Nick Clegg think just doing what the energy companies . ask of them is the answer to bills being too high they are wrong. 'Energy bills have gone up by £120 this winter alone, so even with a £50 . cut in levies, people’s bills will still be higher this winter than last . year. 'The real reason bills are rising year on year without . justification is because the energy market is broken. Instead of bailing . out the energy companies, David Cameron should stand up to them and . stop them overcharging people.' Energy Secretary Ed Davey said the plan was a 'serious, workable package' but Labour's Caroline Flint said bills would still be higher than last winter . Mr Osborne yesterday said he was . certain that the average £50 saving from slashing the Energy Company . Obligation would be passed on by energy firms to consumers. He . said: ‘This will help families. We’ve been in discussions with the . energy companies. We are absolutely insistent that this is going to be . brought in.’ Asked how £1,000 grants for homebuyers to improve energy efficiency and cuts to environmental levies on bills would be funded, Mr Osborne replied: ‘The money will come from additional taxes that we will raise from dealing with tax avoidance.’ He refused to give details of the tax avoidance crackdown but said people were wrong to be sceptical about whether such action really raised revenue. ‘This government has taken step after step and the amount of tax we collect from people who were previously avoiding their tax goes up by billions of pounds over this parliament,’ he said. The Chancellor attacked Labour’s pledge of a 20-month freeze on energy prices if they win the election - which has been dominating the political agenda since Ed Miliband announced it in September.

With gaping eyes and silky-soft fur, these adorable creatures have become a YouTube sensation and a must-have pet. But their popularity threatened their very survival. Captured by illegal traders and kept in hideous conditions, the primates from Sumatra, Indonesia, were due to be sold in one of Java's notorious animal markets as exotic pets. Rescued: 238 slow lorises were seized as they were transported by illegal traders to a Javan animal market . But just days before they reached their destination, the gang was caught by British animal rights volunteers, who have handed the lorises to International Animal Rescue. At 238, it is the largest number of lorises ever seized from illegal traders - and six more had died en route. On arrival, the IAR medical team examined the confiscated primates. Many . were suffering from stress-related illnesses, dehydration, malnutrition . and dental problems as some had had their teeth cut even before . reaching the markets. Small and gentle, they were crammed by their kidnappers into suffocatingly small and starved of food. Targeted: It is the largest number pf the highly sought-after creatures saved by International Animal Rescue . Trauma: All the primates were suffering from trauma at being suffocated and having their teeth cut . Danger: A further six slow lorises died en route from Sumatra to Java where they were to be sold as exotic pets . ‘Many of these slow lorises will require immediate medical treatment in order for them to be nursed back to health,' said Dr Karmele Llano Sanchez, programme director of IAR Indonesia. ‘The goal will be to begin, as soon as possible, a systematic release process for the fit and healthy individuals. ‘These endangered animals are transported for long distances in awful conditions. 'All . of them suffer during this process and some of them do not even make it . to the markets where all these lorises were to have their teeth cut to . be sold to people who want lorises as pets.' The rescued slow lorises - also called Nycticebus coucan - are now being cared for in the charity's Primate Rehabilitation Centre in Bogor. Care: Many of them are also dehydrated, under-nourished and in severe pain as they recover in a shelter . Serious problem: As slow lorises soar in popularity, more and more are being illegally traded in south east Asia . Hundreds: IAR Indonesia has 400 of them in care today and volunteers are being dispatched to compensate . Gavin Bruce, IAR operations manager, saw the lorises when they arrived and claims it 'nearly broke his heart'. ‘They arrived at night – dozens of white plastic crates packed full of lorises. I think the final count was 238. Only six dead, I was expecting worse. But still, upsetting as hell. ‘There was one crate of mothers with babies, another with really young ones. Some, inevitably, had damage to their eyes. It was horrible to witness.’ The illegal trade of lorises remains rife. Alan Knight, Chief Executive of International Animal Rescue, based in Sussex, said the IAR centre has had to expand to cope with the rising numbers of slow lorises being rescued by Indonesian police and wildlife authorities. Market: After numerous cute YouTube videos, the animals have become a must-have for market sellers . Penalty: Capturing, selling or keeping of slow lorises is punishable by five years in prison and £7,000 in Indonesia . ‘I hope the public will support us in helping our team in Indonesia care for these lorises,’ he added. At the IAR Primate Rehabilitation Centre there are now almost 400 lorises. Slow lorises are small-bodied nocturnal primates found throughout South-east Asia that are threatened by habitat loss, the illegal trade for pets and traditional medicine. They are listed on Appendix 1 of CITES thereby prohibiting any international trade. Furthermore, as stated by Indonesian law, the capturing, selling, or keeping of slow lorises is punishable by up to five years imprisonment with a fine of up to £7,000. However, despite their protected status, slow lorises remain one of the most heavily traded primates in Indonesia as they are regarded as a ‘status symbol’ pet.","238 slow lorises were captured en route to a Javan exotic pet market .

Discovery: Alzheimer's could be late-stage Type 2 diabetes, scientists have found (library image) Alzheimer's and diabetes may be the same disease, scientists claim. They have uncovered evidence that the debilitating form of dementia may be late stages of type 2 diabetes. The discovery would explain why nearly three quarters of patients with this form of diabetes go on to develop Alzheimer’s. Researchers from Albany University, New York State, believe the excess insulin they produce gets into the brain and disrupts key chemicals. Eventually masses of amyloid proteins - which poison brain cells - are created because of the excess which leads to Alzheimers, they say. Ewan McNay from the University said: 'People who develop diabetes . have to realise this is about more than controlling their weight or . diet. It’s also the first step on the road to cognitive decline. 'At first they won’t be able to keep up with their kids playing games, but in 30 years’ time they may not even recognise them.' According to the National Diabetes Audit, about 2.5m people have Type 2 . diabetes, 80 per cent of which were overweight or obese. Alzheimer's affects 500,000 Britons. The increased risk of Alzheimer's for those with Type 2 has been suspected among the scientific community for a while. However, as many people with Type 2 are obese and therefore have shorter life-expectancies, little research has been conducted. The scientists experimented on rats, feeding them a diet with a high-fat content in the hope the would develop Type 2. They then tested the animal's brains and found their memory skills rapidly went down hill as their diabetes progressed. Epidemic: 80 per cent of people with Type Two diabetes are overweight or obese, statistics have shown (library image) When researchers looks at the rats' brains areas of amyloid protein could be seen. Patients with Alzheimer's have similar patterns. McNay, who says he's cut down on chocolate since conducting the research, believes the clumps develop because, as the body becomes resistant to insulin, it produces more of the hormone. Excess insulin then travels to the brain where it is supposed to be controlled by an enzyme that breaks down amyloid. He explained: 'High levels of insulin swamp this enzyme so that it stops breaking down amyloid. 'The latter then accumulates until it forms toxic clumps that poison brain cells. It’s the same amyloid build-up to blame in both diseases — T2 diabetics really do have low-level Alzheimer’s.'","Extra insulin produced in people with disease changes brain's chemistry .

Another spokesman said: 'We've only had one complaint, but one complaint is just one too many for us. It's really important that we reassure you that we're taking this very seriously.'

Microsoft has been accused of alienating its female customers after providing a sexist note to gamers promoting the new Xbox One. With the holidays approaching, the company released an online form letter for men to send their girlfriends in a bid to convince them the latest model console would be a good present, for the both of them. The note 'We got your back,' began: 'Hey honey, not sure if you've heard but Xbox One is now available. ...I know, I know. You'd rather knit than watch me slay zombies, but hear me out on this. Xbox One is actually for both of us. Seriously.' Outrage: Microsoft has been accused of alienating its female customers after sending the online form letter, pictured, to gamers promoting the Xbox One . The note immediately sparked a backlash on Social Media, with critics labeling it condescending and heteronormative, according to the Daily Dot. Female gamers highlighted they don't need a man to bully them into buying games and pointed out the company doesn't understand that women make up nearly half of its customers. According to a recent USAToday report, some 45 per cent of gamers in 2013 are women.

The letter lists five reasons why the girlfriend, who is interested in Tracy Anderson fitness videos, dancing and Skyping her sister, should buy her man, a gaming and football fanatic, the new Xbox, or at least allow it into the home. The initial outrage prompted the company to revise the original note to make it more gender-neutral and less condescending. Lines like 'You'd rather knit than watch me slay zombies,' have been replaced with 'You'd rather do your taxes early than watch me slay zombies.' The approach was perhaps unsurprising given the boys club inside Microsoft. According to a September Huffington Post article titled 'MicBROsoft,' nearly 80 per cent of the firm's employees are men, including seven of nine board members and all of the four people charged with finding Microsoft a new CEO.","With the holidays approaching, the company released an online form letter for men to send their girlfriends in a bid to convince them the latest model console would be a good present, for the both of them .

Secret documents released today reveal the full extent to which Whitehall systematically destroyed files relating to colonial crimes committed in the final years of the British empire. Files published by the National Archives at Kew tell how administration staff in Kenya, Uganda and Malaya ‘cleansed’ so-called dirty documents. Material which could ‘embarrass Her Majesty’s Government’ was burnt, dumped in rivers or discreetly flown to Britain to stop it falling into the hands of post-independence regimes. Inmates: Mau Mau's, prisoners captured by the British sitting with hands on top of their heads . Today’s declassified documents are the eighth and final batch of 8,800 files from 37 former colonies held in a secret Foreign Office archive at Hanslope Park, Buckinghamshire. They should have been made available to the public, but were kept hidden. The existence of the archive only emerged last year, when a group of Kenyans who were detained and tortured during the Mau Mau rebellion in the 1950s sued the British government, which finally agreed to release the files. The latest batch contains scant detail of any atrocities committed – implying that the majority of the damning papers have been destroyed. Among them are thought to be records of the torture and murder of Mau Mau insurgents detained by British colonial authorities, the alleged massacre of 24 unarmed villagers in Malaya by soldiers of the Scots Guards in 1948 and sensitive documents kept by colonial authorities in Aden, where the army’s Intelligence Corps operated a secret torture centre in the 1960s. Crimes: Mau Mau suspects being led away for questioning by police in 1952 . The destruction of this material was a huge undertaking, and in Uganda was codenamed Operation Legacy. The documents make reference to ‘clean’ and ‘dirty’ files – presumably a reference to the information included in them. Officials were told that ‘emphasis is placed upon destruction’, and no trace of either the documents or their incineration should remain. Colonial officials in Kenya were told: ‘It is permissible, as an alternative to destruction by fire, for documents to be packed in weighted crates and dumped in very deep and current-free water at maximum practicable distance from the coast.’ And in Uganda, an official effectively excluded anyone who was not white from being involved in the destruction of certain documents. He wrote: ‘Steps are being taken to ensure that such papers are only seen and handled by Civil Service Officers who are British subjects of European descent.’ The files are available to the public from today in the reading rooms at The National Archives.","Material which could ‘embarrass Her Majesty’s Government’ was burnt .

A group of influential Conservative MPs are calling on the Chancellor to permanently grant small firms exemption from business rates . George Osborne is set to cut business taxes this week after Tory MPs called on him to ease small firms’ burden. Some 37 influential Conservative MPs are publishing a report today calling on the Chancellor to permanently grant small firms exemption from business rates. And last night Tory sources said Mr Osborne will heed their advice in his Autumn Statement on Thursday. The MPs’ report says firms are still suffering from excessive regulation. Last night, a Tory source said: ‘I understand there will be some action on this.’ The demand comes as leading Tories also called for income tax cuts and London Mayor Boris Johnson pressed the case for a one-off VAT cut on a new bridge in the capital. The group of MPs, led by backbencher Kwasi Kwarteng, also call for councils to offer rate cuts to businesses who occupy empty properties. And the MPs said the threshold of taxable income at which firms have to register for VAT should rise from £79,000 to £100,000. Small companies are completely exempt from business rates until March 31, 2014, on properties with a rateable value of £6,000 or less and get some relief on those whose rateable value is under £12,000. Treasury sources said the Chancellor will have to ‘make a decision’ on what to do about business rate relief as it is due to expire next year. Insiders say it is likely he will extend it until the General Election. But the MPs say it should be made permanent. All shops and offices pay business rates, a tax for local services. The amount they pay is based on the rateable value of the property, roughly the amount those premises could have been let for at the last valuation in April 2008. Small firms currently get a 100 per cent rebate on their business rates if their rateable value is under £6,000. This then tapers off until relief hits zero at properties with a rateable value of £12,000. MPs are calling for the rateable value threshold to go up to £14,000. MP Kwasi Kwarteng is leading the group, which also call for councils to offer rate cuts to businesses who occupy empty properties . Those who have signed the paper include chairman of the Treasury select committee Andrew Tyrie and David Cameron’s envoy to the Indian community Prit Patel. Mr Kwarteng said: ‘In preparing his Autumn Statement, George Osborne should consider how tough life is for many businesses. The combination of business rates and red tape is stifling people’s ability to drive the economy forward.’ The Free Enterprise Group report comes amid calls for cuts to personal taxation. Former defence secretary Liam Fox said yesterday Mr Osborne should return to his pre-crash policy of ‘sharing the proceeds of growth’ – between measures to control the deficit and easing the cost of living for cash-strapped families. Mr Osborne will also announce £30million of public money for the construction of a ‘garden bridge’ across the Thames. Sources close to Mr Johnson say he is pressing Mr Osborne to give it a VAT exemption.","Dozens of Tory MPs want financial burdens on small firms to be eased .

Burka fugitive Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed is believed to be a follower of the world's most wanted female terrorist, British 'White Widow' Samantha Lewthwaite, and may have fled abroad to join her. The Somali-born 27-year-old has been on the run for four days after removing his electronic tag and giving surveillance officers the slip by walking out of a mosque in Acton, west London, in a full cloak. He has links to Al-Shabaab - a terror group that Lewthwaite is believed to help lead - and Mohamed may be trying to leave the UK to join them on a fake passport. Fanatics belonging to the terror group, which recruits extremists from all over the world, were behind the Kenyan mall massacre which left 67 people dead. They are also accused of plotting attacks on Western interests in east Africa. Links: Fugitive terror suspect Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed, 27, pictured left, has been linked to the White Widow, Samantha Lewthwaite, pictured right . A Kenyan intelligence file shows a direct link between Mohamed, Lewthwaite - the widow of 7/7 bomber Germaine Lindsay - and the terrorist group. 'It is known that his associates have . access to false passports and cash to facilitate international travel,' a source told the Mirror. 'The . fear is that will try to join up with his former terror unit to help . carry out attacks like the one we saw in Nairobi in September.' Two former leaders of Al-Shabaab, Saleh Nabhan and Harun Fazul, who trained Lewthwaite, are named in a High Court judgement on Mohamed's appeal against his Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measure. According to the Mirror a High Court judge described the national security case against Mohamed - named only as CC - as 'overwhelming'. The Mirror reports the following passages form the judgment, by Lord Justice Jones, who wrote: 'The Security Service assesses that CC is linked to a group of British nationals who received terrorist training from al-Qaeda operatives, Saleh Nabhan and Harun Fazul in Somalia in 2006. 'It assesses that the group returned to the United Kingdom in late 2006 and early 2007 and has evolved into a well established and prolific extremist facilitation network, actively supporting extremist associates in East Africa. 'The network consists of a UK-based group and an East-Africa based group. The UK-based group supports the activities of the associates in Somalia and also seeks to recruit and radicalise further individuals.' Caught on CCTV: Mohamed entered the An-Noor . Masjid Mosque and Community Centre in Acton, west London, at 10am. He . was last seen inside the mosque at 3.15pm before leaving disguised in a . burka (right) It is understood Mohamed took part in terrorist training in 2008 and is believed to have helped various individuals travel from the UK to Somalia to allow them to engage in terrorism-related activity. Mohamed, who is 5ft 8in and of medium build, is also suspected of helping to plan attacks in Somalia and overseas, including an attack intended for the Juba Hotel in Mogadishu in 2010. He is thought to be a member of a UK-based network that had access to money, false passports and documentation, as well as equipment, and is understood to have procured funds and weapons for terrorism uses for the network. It emerged last night that he repeatedly purchased phone cards used to call contacts overseas in the weeks before he fled. He bought the international Lycamobile cards from a newsagent close to the An-Noor Masjid Mosque and Community Centre in west London â€“ the same mosque from which he made his escape dressed in a burka last Friday. The purchase of the phone cards will fuel suspicions he had long been plotting to escape abroad, possibly back to his Al-Shabaab associates in Somalia. Security officials fear he may already be overseas, and there are question marks about how he was able to disable his tag because it should trigger an alarm.

The budget for the High Speed 2 railway linking London to the Midlands has increased by nearly £10 billion because of the addition of a tunnel to plans, the Transport Secretary has told MPs. Ahead of an expected rebellion by Conservative MPs, Patrick McLoughlin said the £42.6billion budget also included a large contingency fund. The original budget had been about £33billion. The Government argues the highly controversial HS2 will help to bridge the North-South divide by cutting journey times and fuelling economic growth in the Midlands and North. The budget for the High Speed 2 railway has increased by nearly £10 billion to more than £40 billion partly because of the addition of a tunnel to plans, the Transport Secretary has told MPs . It hopes the first stage of the project, between London and Birmingham, would start in 2017 and finish in 2026. The second stage, to Manchester and Leeds, would be completed by 2033. HS2 Ltd has previously said the tunnel would run between Castle Bromwich Business Park and the eastern edge of Washwood Heath, the BBC reports. Original plans involved using the existing Derby to Birmingham railway line before running under the M6 Bromford Viaduct. The first phase is now budgeted at . £21.4 billion and the second phase at £21.2 billion, and includes a . £12.7 billion contingency fund across the scheme. Mr McLoughlin said: 'I will be writing tomorrow to the chairman of HS2 to set a target price for the delivery of phase of the project. That is £17 billion at 2011 prices. This takes account of the design and environmental changes to improve the scheme. 'There was the point in relation to the Olympic Games - a contingency was allowed and actually the price of the Games came in below the price that had been set by the Government. 'While I expect the final costs to be lower than those I have just outlined... this is the right way to plan the project.' The increased costs are a reflection of changes to the route, including a tunnel under the M6 at Birmingham, and an increased contingency fund. The revelations came as MPs debated the High Speed Rail (Preparation) Bill at second reading, proposals which pave the way for the development and planning of the line and allows spending by the Department for Transport to get the project up and running. Patrick McLoughlin said the £42.6 billion budget also included a large contingency fund . Mr McLoughlin said: 'It is very important we are seen as being able to compete with other countries in the global race to attract businesses to this country. 'I am going to be very open with the House and put all this into the (public) domain... I want to be as open as I possibly can.' The Transport Secretary faced a series of questions from his own benches about compensation and mitigation for the scheme and said he had 'respect and understanding' for objections. But he defended the project as being essential for Britain’s future growth. 'The easiest thing in the world for the Government to do would be not to build HS2,' Mr McLoughlin said. 'But the cost of doing that would be huge. It would be a cost in jobs - our modest estimates are HS2 will create and support 100,000 jobs, while the group of core cities predict HS2 will underpin 400,000 jobs, 70 per cent of them outside London. 'It would be a cost in prosperity - some estimates suggest HS2 will add over £4 billion to the economy even before it is open and the line is estimated to provide around £50 billion worth of economic benefits once it is up and running. 'If we don’t go ahead with HS2, there will also be a cost in lost opportunities for the towns and the cities in the Midlands and the North. 'I’m not prepared to put up with a situation where you can get to Brussels on a high speed train line but not to Birmingham. Where you can get to Strasbourg on high speed trains but not to Sheffield. To Lille but not to Leeds. 'We cannot afford to leave the economic future of our great cities... to an overcrowded 200 year old railway.' Conservative MP Andrea Leadsom (South Northamptonshire) questioned the cost-benefit analysis of the HS2 project, given the increased costs. Intervening, she said: 'Could you explain what the £12.7 billion of contingency will do to the benefit-cost ratio, because certainly during the consultation period, it was always made clear the £32 billion was the absolute maximum and contained a vast sum for contingency?' Mr McLoughlin explained: 'I would point out the amount of benefit-cost ratio (BCR) is reckoned to be 2.5 - I also point that BCR does tell us some things but it doesn’t tell us everything. The Government argues the highly controversial HS2 will help to bridge the North-South divide by cutting journey times and fuelling economic growth in the Midlands and North . 'For instance, BCR on the Jubilee (London Underground) Line was a lot lower than it is for HS2. Actually, if the Jubilee Line had not been developed, a lot of the development we now see down in Canary Wharf would not have taken place. That brought a huge amount of investment into the area and into the country.' Labour MP Natascha Engel (North East Derbyshire) urged the Transport Secretary to commit to publishing receipts for expenditure under the Bill before MPs today. The High Speed Rail (Preparation) Bill does not green-light spending on the main project but allowed for 'preparatory expenditure' by the Secretary of State. Mr McLoughlin said he was committed to transparency and Parliamentary scrutiny but said he could only look at Ms Engel’s request, rather than agree from the outset. Mr McLoughlin said the coalition was considering a number of compensation schemes for residents affected by the planned rail line, including a possible 'property bond'. British businesses would benefit from the projects, he added. 'On building HS2 we also need to ensure that we make the best use of British skills and workers,' said Mr McLoughlin, adding that 97per cent of Crossrail contracts had been awarded to British-based companies. He said: 'From 2017, HS2 will create 19,000 engineering and construction jobs.'","Budget increased to £42.6billion and includes large contingency fund .

Tragic: Jamie Rolfe plunged to his death down a 300ft ravine in the French Alps, an inquest heard . A young British ski chalet rep plunged to his death down a 320ft ravine in the French Alps while drunk, an inquest heard today. Jamie Rolfe, 27, shared a bottle of wine and drunk several pints and a shot before leaving his friend's house at 4.30am in Les Deux Alpes ski resort, near Grenoble. He walked to the 'Edge of the World' ravine - a remote spot where he used to go to admire the stars - before tragically falling into it. Mr Rolfe, from Newport, Isle of Wight, had been spending the winter season working in his 'dream job' for tour operator Skiworld, while making a snowboarding film. He had visited two bars and a nightclub with friends on January 26, 2011, before making his way to friend Michael Turner’s apartment at 2am to continue partying. He could have stayed overnight with his group of friends, but chose to leave at 4.30am - instead heading for the high beauty spot. Mr Rolfe's concerned manager raised the alarm at 6.30pm the following day after repeated attempts to call the young rep had failed. A police search was launched and Mr Rolfe's body was discovered 50-200 feet down the steep Venosc Combe Noire ravine. Today, Assistant Coroner Hugh Calloway said the spot - which offered 'beautiful views' - had previously claimed the lives of seven others. 'The attraction of these places is the danger as well, I suppose,' he told the hearing in Newport. 'Snowboarders have a sense of danger and it’s difficult to have the adrenaline buzz without the risk. 'Dream job': Mr Rolfe had been working as a chalet rep in Les Deux Alpes ski resort, near Grenoble, France . 'This is an absolutely tragic death. It . is easy to see Jamie was obviously a much-loved person who enjoyed what . he did and died doing it. Recording a verdict of accidental death, Mr Calloway said Mr Rolfe - a Film Studies graduate - had told his friends he was 'returning home' after leaving Mr Turner's apartment. 'Wednesday was change over day at the resort and Jamie and his friends went out to various pubs and clubs as young people do,' he said. 'He went back to a friend’s at around 4.30am, but decided to leave Michael’s flat and said he was going to return home. 'Obviously we do not have any evidence of what occurred after he left but it was a clear night and the stars were shining brightly.' He added: 'Jamie obviously suffered a severe head injury and died instantly and there is no reason to suspect that his death was anything other than a tragic accident. 'It is clear there had been six or seven previous deaths there, including a couple the previous year and Jamie was the eighth person to die there.' Today, Mr Rolfe’s parents said they were 'shocked and devastated' by the death of their son, whom they described as a 'lively, free spirit'. His father Roger Rolfe, 67, a retired therapist, told the court: 'It was an exceptionally clear starry night and Jamie had been known to go and watch the stars at the ravine. It had a magnificent view but it was risky. 'A French official said to us that they can’t chain the whole mountain off. Young men like to go and watch the sky there at night.' Mr Rolfe said his son had loved his job and had planned to move to China - where he had taught English - to be with his girlfriend Xiao Bei. Speaking outside court, he said: 'Jamie packed more into 27 years than most people do in a lifetime. 'It was typical of him that he loved to go and look at the stars and the sunrise. He loved night. 'If you look at the drop he fell off it’s phenomenal, hundreds and hundreds of feet high. He fell off and hit a ledge, we were told, and think he probably fell backwards looking at the stars. 'The only blessing is that his death would have been quick.' Mrs Rolfe, who works for the NHS, said her son’s friends had raised funds to put a memorial plaque at the spot, which carries his Chinese nickname - Dhengi - meaning 'Little Rice'. 'Hopefully this might make other young men more cautious,' she added. Toxicology reports revealed Mr Rolfe would have been 'severely intoxicated', with 2.97 grams of alcohol per litre in his blood, and 4.15 grams in his urine. Post mortems in both France and the UK confirmed the cause of death as multiple traumatic injuries. In 2009, two other British holidaymakers Richard Ryan, 27, and Christopher Lockwood, 28, were found dead at the ravine. The pair had been drinking in a tavern and left at 2am. It is believed they lost their footing and plunged hundreds of feet to their deaths.","Jamie Rolfe, 27, fell down 320ft ravine in Les Deux Alpes, near Grenoble .

At the height of the plebgate row, Andrew Mitchell emerged from a small blue car to deliver an apology. But he had a Jaguar XF on order . Now Sir George – dubbed the bicycling . baronet for his preferred mode of transport – has pulled the plug before . a final contract was signed. Two weeks after his appointment Mr Mitchell had demanded a dedicated vehicle to ferry him and other whips around the corner in Westminster. While most ministers use an eco-friendly Toyota Prius, Mr Mitchell insisted on a Jaguar XF. But Sir George was appalled at the idea and has cancelled the order. A Whitehall source said: ‘In a nutshell the order had been placed but the contract was never signed. The new chief whip is happy not to have a car.’ The move will save £100,000 for the taxpayer. New Chief Whip Sir George Young, (left) who has cancelled the Jaguar order, has long had a reputation in Westminster as the 'bicycling baronet' for his love of two wheels (right) Mr Mitchell’s demand staggered civil servants since whips do not have public engagements. On September 19 while trying to leave Downing Street on his bike, Mr Mitchell was told by officers to use a side gate. In his extraordinary resignation letter Mr Mitchell denied calling police officers ‘plebs’, as they have claimed, but admitted swearing at them, telling the Prime Minister he had said: ‘I thought you guys were supposed to ****ing  help us.’ This appears to contradict an appearance in the Commons earlier this week when he was seen mouthing the words ‘I didn’t swear’. He said in his letter: ‘Over the last two days it has become clear to me that whatever the rights and wrongs of the matter I will not be able to fulfil my duties as we would both wish.’ David Cameron said he was ‘sorry’ to lose Mr Mitchell but understood why he was leaving. Yesterday the Prime Minister was ridiculed by Labour, because he had replaced Rugby-educated Mr Mitchell with Sir George, who went to Eton.","Sir George Young pulls the plug on luxury car order saving £100,000 .

Travelers are no stranger to the US airport security line in which passengers are required to put personal belongings in plastic tubs to be scanned by security machines. According to the Transportation Security Administration, when travelers take back their belongings they leave loose change behind--lots of it. Bloomberg Businessweek reports that more than $500,000 worth of change was left in security tubs in the last fiscal year. Change from travelers belongings going through airport security added up to over $500,000 this year . The L.A. Times reports that $32,000 of the coins left behind are foreign currency. The $531,395 of coins TSA collected from airports last year was put in an 'aviation security fund' and spent on airport security and on signs translated into foreign languages for international travelers. Some members of Congress think that the money should go to the military. Jeff Miller, a Republican representative from Florida, just put forth a bill in attempt to have TSA collect the funds for rest and relaxation stations in airports for military officers and their families. Florida Republican Rep. Jeff Miller thinks the money should go to rest stations for military personnel and their families . His bill would require non-profit organizations dedicated to helping veterans bid for money. The only eligible non-profit that currently has a national presence is the United Service Organization. The 72-year-old service organization has rest centers in 44 U.S. airports. The bill was approved last week and is under review by the House of Representatives. An earlier version of the bill would have cost $1 million to implement. The new version wont cost as much because it wont touch funds the TSA already collected, the Congressional Budget Office discovered earlier this week. 'I was pretty aggravated that they said it was going to cost money to give money away,' said Miller.

Hacked: The Old Bailey was told that Sven Goran Eriksson had his phone hacked by the News Of The World for almost his entire time as England manager . Sven  Goran Eriksson had his phone hacked by the News of the World for almost his entire tenure as England manager, the Old Bailey heard on Wednesday. The court was told that Mr Eriksson and his lover Faria Alam were monitored by private investigator Glenn Mulcaire between 2002 and 2006, leading to several high profile stories at the now-defunct tabloid. Among them was the 65-year-old's affair with FA employee Miss Alam, with the 'first details' of the relationship emerging from hacked messages in June 2004. The court heard that two hacks by the . paper came just days before Mr Eriksson was exposed in a sting operation . 'perpetrated' by undercover reporter, so-called Fake Sheikh, Mazher . Mahmood, which prosecutors say led to a story with the headline 'This . Man Is A Crook'. The England boss's phone was also hacked just a day before his team were due to kick-off their 2006 World Cup campaign. Prosecutor . Mark Bryant-Heron told the jury that when Mulcaire was arrested in . August 2006 on suspicion of phone hacking, recordings of two voicemail . messages intercepted from Mr Eriksson's phone were found at his address. One was from Everton chairman Bill . Kenwright relating to player transfers, Mr Bryant-Heron told the jury, . and the other from an Italian player. The . court heard that Mr Kenwright had left a message saying: 'I didn't get . back to you before I signed James Beattie and I wanted to talk to you . about another of your England players before I sign him.' Mr Eriksson was the subject of intense . media scrutiny while managing the England football team between 2001 . and 2006, including coverage of his affair with Miss Alam, which started . in 2004. Target: The court was told Glenn Mulcaire, left, monitored Mr Eriksson and his lover Faria Alam, right, between 2002 and 2006, leading to several high-profile stories . Jurors were shown . the pages from Mulcaire's notebooks from May 2002 which had Mr . Eriksson's phone number in, but had not at that point been attributed to . the England boss. The . same number cropped up against in August that year in taskings from NoTW . news editors Neville Thurlbeck and Greg Miskiw, this time with Mr . Eriksson's name on it. A . new phone number for Mr Eriksson was in pages of the notebook from June . 2004, alongside the mobile number and central London address of Miss . Alam. Mulcaire had also noted down Miss Alam's PIN and had written down a set of bank details on June 20, 2004. The expose of the affair between Mr Eriksson and Miss Alam was published in the News of the World on July 18, 2004. Job: The England boss's phone was also hacked just a day before his team were due to kick-off their 2006 World Cup campaign, the jury was told . It was followed the next week with another exclusive that Miss Alam was also sleeping with FA executive Mark Palios, and another follow-up on August 8, 2004 with Alam's thought's on Mr Eriksson's then-partner Nancy Dell'Olio. Prosecutor Mark Bryant-Heron showed . evidence of a string of calls to Mr Eriksson's and Miss Alam's phones . from Mulcaire, which he said were all evidence of hacking. This . included five calls between January 17 and 20, 2006, just before the . Fake Sheikh expose in which the England boss was duped into a string of . indiscrete remarks about his future with the national team. Partnership: The court heard that after the expose of Mr Eriksson's affair, several stories followed - including Miss Alam's thoughts on his then partner Nancy Dell'Olio, right . 'It is suggested these phone calls are hacks', said Mr Bryant-Heron. Jurors were shown two more phone contacts from Mulcaire the following week, then more again into February.

A federal judge approved a $40 million class-action settlement Monday between Skechers USA Inc. and consumers who bought toning shoes after ads made unfounded claims that the footwear would help people lose weight and strengthen muscles. U.S. District Judge Thomas B. Russell in Louisville approved the deal, which covers more than 520,000 claims. About 1,000 people eligible for coverage by the settlement opted not to take part. Those with approved claims will be able to get a maximum repayment for their purchase - up to $80 per pair of Shape-Ups; $84 per pair of Resistance Runner shoes; up to $54 per pair of Podded Sole Shoes; and $40 per pair of Tone-Ups. Unfounded claims: Skechers billed its Shape-ups as a fitness tool designed to promote weight loss and tone muscles with the shoe's curved 'rocker' or rolling bottom - now consumers are entitled to refunds . Russell also awarded $5 million for the attorneys in the case to split. Russell ordered that the money cannot come from the $40 million settlement fund set aside for consumers. Two people that served as the lead plaintiffs in the case will receive payments of $2,500 each. Russell considered multiple factors in deciding to approve the settlement and found it provides just compensation to the plaintiffs. 'Accordingly, the court finds that the proposed settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate,' Russell wrote. The approval comes a year after Manhattan Beach, Calif.-based Skechers reached a deal with the Federal Trade Commission over the ads. The settlement covers more than 70 lawsuits from across the country. The lawsuits were consolidated in federal court in Louisville. Skechers denied the allegations but said it settled to avoid long litigation. The settlement grew out of a series of ads Skechers aired featuring celebrity endorsers such as Kim Kardashian and Brooke Burke, with claims that the shoes could help people lose weight and strengthen their butt, leg and stomach muscles. Skechers billed its Shape-ups as a fitness tool designed to promote weight loss and tone muscles with the shoe's curved 'rocker' or rolling bottom - saying it provides natural instability and causes the consumer to 'use more energy with every step.' Shape-ups cost about $100 and are sold at retailers nationwide. Sketchy: The settlement grew out of a series of ads featuring stars such as Kim Kardashian, stating that the shoes could help people lose weight and strengthen butt, leg and stomach muscles . Ads for the Resistance Runner shoes claimed people who wear them could increase 'muscle activation' by up to 85 percent for posture-related muscles and 71 percent for one of the muscles in the buttocks. Eleven people filed objections to the settlement, ranging from people seeking the full purchase price of their shoes in return to one person saying the settlement would preclude him from seeking damages on his own. The judge rejected those arguments. Should claims not consume the entire $40 million settlement, Russell ordered the remaining money to go to the Federal Trade Commission. A settlement with the FTC bars Skechers from running the ads in the future. The agency settled similar charges with Reebok last year over its EasyTone walking shoes and RunTone running shoes. That $25 million agreement also provided customer refunds.","A federal judge approved a $40 million .

Relatives of ‘Soldier N’ said that he had claimed the car crash in Paris in 1997 in which Princess Diana was killed was caused by SAS assassins. He believed that special forces . agents had shone a light into the eyes of Diana's driver Henri Paul - leading to him losing control of the car and hitting a pillar in a tunnel in Paris.

A police spokesman said: ‘We are in the process of drawing up conclusions, which will be communicated to the families and interested parties before any further comment can be made.’ An inquest in 2008 found that Princess Diana and Dodi Al Fayed were unlawfully killed due to the ‘gross negligence’ of Mr Paul, a security manager at the Paris Ritz Hotel, who had been drinking. However, the driver’s mother Gisele said she believed her son was murdered together with Diana and Mr Al Fayed when the Mercedes he was driving crashed in the French underpass.

Leach harmful gases: Building large-scale wind farms on peat bogs could actually increase the emission of greenhouse gases . Building large-scale wind farms on peat bogs could actually increase the emission of greenhouse gases, according to scientists. Britain’s peatland holds 3.2 trillion tonnes of carbon trapped in the soil, but will easily leach harmful gases if damaged. More than half of the wind farms planned for Scotland are intended for areas of peatland, which are commonly found in rolling upland areas perfectly suited for giant turbines. Peatland makes up just over 10 per cent of England, 20 per cent of Wales and 65 per cent of Scotland. Researchers at the University of Aberdeen have devised a method to calculate the ‘carbon payback’ time for wind farms on peat soil. It is currently used by the wind farm industry to assess the CO2 impact of their developments. As turbines are mostly located in remote areas, they require miles of new roads to service them, drying out or destroying the peat below. Peat only retains carbon when it is moist, so any large-scale damage would result in huge amounts of carbon being lost to the atmosphere, which scientists say contributes to global warming. They concluded that building giant turbines on pristine peat should never be allowed, as the damage would outweigh any green benefits. The researchers found wind farms can still be built on degraded bogs, but ‘good management’ would be crucial if carbon savings are to be achieved. The new director-general of the National Trust yesterday came to the defence of wind farms, describing turbines as ‘beautiful’ and arguing that future generations will look at them with fondness. In an interview, Dame Helen Ghosh said: ‘Wind turbines in the right place are fine. We object to wind turbines where they are a blot on our historic landscape.’ She added: ‘I think they can look graceful, and this goes back to thinking in centuries. If you think back to what the railways looked like to the 19th century mind...I think we have to have our minds open to how the wind turbine will appear to us in 100 years.’ More than half of the wind farms planned for Scotland are intended for areas of peatland (pictured), which are commonly found in rolling upland areas perfectly suited for giant turbines . 'Green' energy: There are currently more than 3,300 onshore wind turbines in Britain, with 2,600 more approved or being built. The industry is also seeking planning permission for a further 2,850 . There are currently more than 3,300 . onshore wind turbines in Britain, with 2,600 more approved or being . built. The industry is also seeking planning permission for a further . 2,850. In a letter to the journal Nature, the Aberdeen research team led by Dr Jo Smith wrote: ‘We contend that wind farms on peatlands will probably not reduce emissions, unlike those on mineral soils.’ With carbon emissions for power production set to drop in the future, the scientists added: ‘Peatland sites would be less likely to generate a reduction in carbon emissions, even with careful management. Unless the volume of peat excavated can be significantly reduced relative to energy output, we suggest that construction of wind farms on non-degraded peats should always be avoided.’ The wind industry insists that it increasingly builds ‘floating roads’ which do not disturb the peat. But wildlife conservationist and peat expert, Richard Lindsay of the University of East London, said these roads inevitably sink and cause long-lasting damage. It is estimated that half of all new wind farms are planned for areas that contain peat. ‘Peatland is not suitable for wind farms for a whole host of environmental reasons, not just carbon loss,’ said Mr Lindsay. ‘But even if we are just looking at greenhouse gas emissions, in the long run, the damage done to a peat bog by building roads and infrastructure will outweigh the benefit of building a wind farm. Assess CO2 impact of developments: Researchers at the University of Aberdeen (pictured) have devised a method to calculate the 'carbon payback' time for wind farms on peat soil . ‘The tragic irony is that the exact places were blanket bogs develop are also perfect for wind farms in terms of the conditions and being away from residential areas.’ Helen McDade, from the John Muir Trust, which campaigns to protect wild land, said: ‘Left in or restored to good condition, [peatland] lock in harmful greenhouse gas emissions. It therefore makes no sense to site major industrial wind developments that are supposed to be helping achieve CO2 reduction targets, on such sites if they damage the peat and release significant amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.’ Jennifer Webber, a spokesman for RenewableUK, which represents the wind farm industry, said: ‘Currently wind farm developers undergo an environmental impact assessment ahead of each development, so the benefits and costs of a scheme in total can be rigorously assessed.’","Britain's peatland holds 3.2 trillion tonnes of carbon trapped in the soil .

The No. 15-ranked Florida Gators basketball team had to get to Storrs, Connecticut, for a game against the UConn Huskies . The Gators fell to No. 12-ranked UConn, 65-64. The basketball team was not responsible for the cancellation of the flight - that was Delta's decision, University of Florida spokesman Denver Parler said. A Delta spokesman said that all of the passengers who booked tickets on the canceled Flight 5059 were either put on later flights or given vouchers for a free flight. 'Delta apologizes to those customers on Delta Connection flight 5059, operated by ExpressJet, who were impacted by the resulting cancellation of their flight,' Delta said in a statement.","The full flight from Gainesville, Florida, was canceled, even though passengers could see their plane sitting on the tarmac .

Plans are underway to recreate the famous Flanders fields of poppies to mark the centenary of the outbreak of the First World War - in England. The Belgian battlefields, which saw some of the conflict's bloodiest fighting, were immortalised in Lieutenant Colonel John McCrae's iconic war poem. And the image of fields strewn with graves and poppies 'row on row' became an international symbol of remembrance for all those who died. Remembrance: The stunning fields of poppies in Flanders. Plans are underway to recreate the famous scene in Gosport, Hampshire . Now England is set to get its own version, as civic leaders in Gosport, Hampshire, plan to fill a country park with the blood-red flowers. They already have bought thousands of poppy seeds and are looking for an historic aircraft to scatter some of them in a fly-past next year. It's hoped the idea would serve as a poignant reminder of those who sacrified their lives in the 'war to end all wars' from 1914 - 1918. And it could boost tourism as people flock to pay their respects. Gosport Borough Councillor Derek Kimber is leading the project. Cllr Kimber said: 'Having our own Flanders Field this side of the English Channel would be wonderful. 'It's in the very early stages at the moment but Hampshire County Council would like to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the start of the war. 'Here in Gosport we are keen to be involved with that, especially since we have a great number of veterans amongst us. Killing fields: The Belgian battlefields saw some of the conflict's bloodiest fighting and were immortalised in Lieutenant Colonel John McCrae's iconic war poem . 'We've identified an area in the Alver Valley where we would like to plant some poppy seeds. 'And we've made enquiries about possibly getting an aircraft to drop more poppy seeds in a ceremony as well. 'I will be talking to various groups and organisations over the coming months to see how we can go about taking the idea further.' The town of Gosport has the highest ratio of veterans in the country - with 68 veterans per 1,000 people, Local Government Association figures reveal. Gosport has a rich military history and is the home of the Royal Navy Submarine Museum . Cllr Kimber, a Falklands Royal Navy veteran, said: 'We have a higher than average number of veterans, having been a garrison town for over 250 years. 'All the Armed Forces have operated from Gosport at one time, so there's quite a background and I want to make sure they're looked after. In Flanders fields the poppies blowBetween the crosses, row on row,That mark our place; and in the skyThe larks, still bravely singing, flyScarce heard amid the guns below.We are the Dead. Short days agoWe lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,Loved and were loved, and now we lieIn Flanders fields.Take up our quarrel with the foe:To you from failing hands we throwThe torch; be yours to hold it high.If ye break faith with us who dieWe shall not sleep, though poppies growIn Flanders fields. 'I believe it's extremely important that we don't forget the millions of people who gave their lives from 1914 - 1918. 'And also those people who subsequently suffered a miserable life after fighting.' Cllr Kimber has already had an offer of a Sopwith Pup, a single seat bi-plane, to take part in the flypast and drop more seeds and poppies, but more could join in. Cllr Kimber said 'I am sure that a lot of people in Hampshire will have fairly historic planes and would like to take the opportunity to fly over this area. 'The idea of our own Flanders Field is a truly exciting prospect.' The proposals form part of a 10 -15 year project to revitalise the 150-plus hectare Alver Valley site, which has two lakes and three walking areas. National plans to mark the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of World War One include a five million pound education programme for schoolchildren. They include trips to the battlefields in Belgium and Northern France. And there's backing for an overhaul of the Imperial War Museum, south London, Prime Minister David Cameron has said. The Heritage Lottery Fund is also inviting applications for support to mark First World War centenary events.","A town in Hampshire will recreate the Belgian battleground's landscape .

But now there's an official list which proves which are the most intelligent cities - and could leave bigger rivals seething with envy. The Intelligent Community Forum has compiled a list of its top seven most intelligent cities after a raft of hopeful cities entered the competition - and leading the way are Canada and Taiwan who have two cities each nominated. Stratford in Ontario has is in the running to be given the prestigious title of most intelligent community . Brainboxes: Toronto has made it to the top seven intelligent communities, the think tank announced . ICF founder Robert Bell said that more than 400 cities around the world vie for the title given by the think tank, which studies the economic and social development of the 21st century community. A panel of academic leaders select about two dozen and inspect them until eventually the final seven are announced, NBC said. Each community is subjected to a rigorous process - such as an inspection of how their local government works to what is taught in universities - before the smartest city is found. They have to prove that they can help educate their citizens and encourage them to prosper. The current list are: . The ICF said: 'Intelligent Communities are those which have – whether through crisis or foresight – come to understand the enormous challenges of the Broadband Economy, and have taken conscious steps to create an economy capable of prospering in it. 'They are not necessarily big cities or famous technology hubs. Oulu city in Finland could be crowned with the title and follow in the footsteps of last year's Californian winners . Top of the class: Tallinn had to prove to the ICF that it could educate its citizens and help them prosper . 'They are located in developing . nations as well as industrialized ones, suburbs as well as cities, the . hinterland as well as the coast.' Last year's winner was Riverside, California which was presented with the title of Intelligent Community of the Year. Mr Bell has so far visited Columbus' Battelle, Nationwide Children's Hospital, The Ohio State University, the OSU Super Computer, the Columbus Metropolitan Library and TechColumbus as he seeks to find the most intelligent community. Hopeful entrants have to prove that they were innovative in encouraging businesses and offering capital to new ventures. They had to show citizens had a strong education and access to further learning. Pick us! Columbus in Ohio made it through to the top seven after 400 cities entered the competition . Taiwan has a greater chance of winning as it has two communities in the final seven. Taichung City is one of the finalists . Taoyuan in Taiwan impressed judges after it explained how it helped its citizens and encouraged the community to develop . Cities had to provide comprehensive . and good broadband connectivity to households and could market their . community as successful. The panel looked for strong leadership . within the area, proof that the success of the community could be . sustained and have strong collaboration, where everyone worked together . to improve themselves. It finally had to proof that it was . 'digitally inclusive' by offering public computers to its citizens and . providing digital literacy courses for residents. The Intelligent Community Forum explained how it compiled its list by examining entrants answers and then shaving the list down until it reached its last few finalists. It said: The Top seven represent models of economic and social transformation in the 21st Century. 'They are not the most advanced technology centers, the most wired cities or the fastest growing economies in the world. 'Instead, each exemplifies best practices in broadband deployment and use, workforce development, innovation, digital inclusion and advocacy that offer lessons to regions, cities, towns and villages around the world. 'They are charting new paths to lasting prosperity for their citizens, businesses and institutions.'","Cities include Columbus in the US, Toronto in Canada and Tallinn, Estonia .

"By . Mark Nicol . PUBLISHED: . 17:04 EST, 30 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:40 EST, 7 December 2013 . A Royal Navy submarine commander was sent on a  two-week luxury cruise of the Mediterranean with his wife in order to adjust to life above the waves – even though he is going to a desk job. Admiralty bosses authorised the cruise as part of an official ‘Surface Ship Familiarisation’ mission for Commander Paul Dunn, 43, who has transferred to a role monitoring merchant ships after spending several years on nuclear submarines. While aboard Saga’s Quest for Adventure, Commander Dunn toured the ship and spoke with its crew, according to the cruise ship’s captain. Commander Paul Dunn, who is paid between £70,000 and £78,000 a year, was in charge of a nuclear submarine but recently transferred to a desk job monitoring merchant ships . The cruise – worth about £4,000 for two people – departed from Malta and stopped off in Tunisia, Sicily, Italy, Majorca and Monte Carlo before ending up in Barcelona, Spain. Designed for holidaymakers over 50, passengers on the cruise enjoyed fine dining, cocktail parties and a host of facilities including a spa while cruising between ports. Entertainments while the officer and his wife were aboard included a magic show and a ballet performance. Last night, Shadow Defence Minister Kevan Jones said the move demonstrated contempt for the 5,000  sailors who have been removed from service in the past three years because of defence cuts. He said: ‘Why are Royal Navy top brass living in luxury when sailors are picking up their P45s in time for Christmas?’ Details of Commander Dunn’s cruise, from October 24 to November 8 this year, emerged after the Ministry of Defence answered a Freedom of Information request, referring to his voyage as a ‘Surface Ship Familiarisation’ mission. The trip was sanctioned under the Merchant Navy Liaison Voyage Scheme, designed to foster relations between the Navy and commercial vessels. In the past 12 months, 53 Royal Navy and Royal Marines officers have taken advantage of the scheme. Commander Dunn was the commanding officer of HMS Vigilant, a Vanguard-class submarine that is part of Britain’s Trident nuclear deterrent. He was awarded an OBE in 2009. Dunn went on the cruise on Saga's Quest For Adventure (pictured) along with his wife. The trip would have cost £4,000 for two civilians . The cruise appears to have been authorised between his posting at the Maritime Warfare Centre at HMS Collingwood, in Hampshire, and a new job at the UK Maritime Trade Operations office in Dubai – from where Royal Navy officers monitor the passage of merchant ships through the Arabian Sea to counter the threat posed by pirates. Although it is also registered by the Merchant Navy, the Quest for Adventure is a tourist ship. On Friday, the MoD said that Commander Dunn was on duty during the cruise, but last night they said he undertook the voyage during his annual leave. David Warden-Owen, the captain of the Quest for Adventure, since renamed the Saga Pearl II, said Commander Dunn had worn his Navy uniform on the voyage and had commented on the differences between life beneath and above the waves. Captain Warden-Owen, 68, said: ‘He commented on how ships and submarines operate at a different medium and height. ‘He talked to the crew and toured the engine room to get a better understanding of the limitations and exposure of a ship. He spent two weeks with us.’ Dunn is a former commander of HMS Vigilant (pictured) and was awarded an OBE for his service in 2009 . Saga spokesman Paul Green said the company had met the costs of the cruise as part of the deal with the Navy. ‘The Royal Navy officers who travel with us from time to time are shadowing and observing our crews. This is a job of work, so we pay the cost. We paid for Commander Dunn and his wife but we do not pay his wages.’ Commander Dunn is paid between £70,000 and £78,000 a year. The MoD insisted that the trip did not involve additional costs to the taxpayer. The MoD also stressed that he paid for his and his wife’s flights to Malta to meet the ship and their return journeys to UK. But last night veterans criticised the scheme as a ‘jolly’. Secretary of the Plymouth branch of the Royal Naval Association, Arthur Gutteridge, said: ‘When I served in the 1960s, we sailed on our own ships. I don’t think there was ever time for those sort of jollies. ‘I would defend senior officers, though. Perhaps they deserve a period of relaxation.’ Last night, a MoD spokeswoman said: ‘The aim of the Merchant Navy Liaison Voyage Scheme is to foster good relations between the Navy and Merchant Navy, providing officers with experience of Merchant Navy operations and encouraging Merchant Navy liaison in Defence matters.’ An earlier version of this article said Commander Dunn’s wife, Kathryn, had gone with him on the trip. In fact the Commander is divorced from Kathryn and he was accompanied by his new wife.","Commander Paul Dunn was in charge of nuclear sub HMS Vigilant .

Cate Blanchett continued her successful tour of the awards circuit in the US over the weekend despite being drawn into the Woody Allen sex saga. The 44-year-old actress wore an exquisite dress at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival, where she was awarded with the 2014 Outstanding Performer of the Year Award for her performance in Allen's Blue Jasmine. On the awards circuit: Cate Blanchett shone in an exquisite dress at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival on Saturday . The executive director of the Santa Barbara festival, Roger Durling, said: 'In her first collaboration with master director Woody Allen, Blanchett knocks it out of the park in the best performance of her already illustrious career.'We're so grateful to be able to celebrate her achievement.' It came after Blanchett was named in an open letter posted by Allen's 28-year-old adopted daughter Dylan Farrow. In the letter, posted in the New York Times on Saturday, she accused her adoptive father of sexually assaulting her when she was seven. The letter also asked various actors who had worked with Woody - including Blanchett and Alec Baldwin - how they would feel if it was their child. Honoured: The 44-year-old actress was being awarded the 2014 Outstanding Performer of the Year Award for her performance in Woody Allen's Blue Jasmine . Winning role: In Blue Jasmine, the five-time Oscar nominee portrays a deeply troubled New York socialite who arrives in San Francisco to impose upon her sister . Cate - mother to Roman, nine, Ignatius, five and Dashiell, 12 - said she hopes Allen and the Farrow family can resolve their situation privately. She told journalist Jeffrey Wells: 'It's obviously been a long and painful situation for the family and I hope they find some sort of resolution and peace.' Responding to a fan asking if he felt he should apologise to Dylan, Baldwin - who has daughters Ireland, 18, and Carmen, five months - wrote on Twitter: 'What the f&@% is wrong w u that u think we all need to b commenting on this family's personal struggle? 'You are mistaken if you think there is a place for me, or any outsider, in this family's issue.' Controversy: Blanchett was named in an open letter printed in the New York Times on Saturday by Woody Allen's adopted daughter Dylan . Dynamic duo: Cate pictured with Rooney Mara at the festival . Woody - who was first alleged to have sexually assaulted Dylan in 1993 - has always maintained his innocence and never been prosecuted. He has yet to respond to Dylan's allegations. Dylan was supported by her 26-year-old brother Ronan on Sunday who publicly stood beside her on Twitter. 'I love and support my sister and I think her words speak for themselves,' Ronan tweeted to his more than 200,000 followers on Twitter. Show of support: Ronan Farrow tweeted his support for sister Dylan . Lena Dunham, 27, of HBO's Girls praised Dylan for writing the open letter. 'To share in this way is courageous, powerful and generous,' Lena tweeted on Sunday to her more than 1.3 million followers in a posting that included a link to the letter in the New York Times. Woody's publicist Leslee Dart on Sunday released a statement from the director denying Dylan's accusation.'Mr. Allen has read the article and found it untrue and disgraceful,' the statement said. In Blue Jasmine, Blanchett portrays a deeply troubled New York socialite who arrives in San Francisco to impose upon her sister. After already sweeping up best actress accolades at the SAG Awards, Critics' Choice Awards, and Golden Globes, Cate is now predicted to win an Oscar for her performance, though she has some stiff competition. She is competing for Best Actress in a Leading Role against Amy Adams in American Hustle, Sandra Bullock in Gravity, Judi Dench in Philomena, and Meryl Streep in August: Osage County. The Academy Awards will be held on March 2. Cate Blanchett's performance in Woody Allen's Blue Jasmine has been lavishly praised, but could Dylan Farrow's letter derail her chances? Leading lady: Cate Blanchett and Woody Allen on the set of Blue Jasmine . It may seem that an 21-year-old alleged crime should have no bearing on Blanchett's 2014 Oscars, but being called out over the issue may make voters think twice before casting their ballots. Farrow concluded her open letter by singling out stars who have starred in Allen's films, including Oscar nominee Cate Blanchett. 'What if it had been your child, Cate Blanchett?' she asked. Blanchett has been tight-lipped on the issue but addressed it last night, saying to journalist Jeffrey Wells, 'It's obviously been a long and painful situation for the family and I hope they find some sort of resolution and peace.' If Blue Jasmine picks up any of the three awards for which it is nominated, is the Academy complicit in the alleged abuse by feting Allen and ignoring his crimes? Allen's guilt is currently being tried in the court of public opinion, and it's unclear whether the Academy will take a stand. So far, Blanchett has won the best actress award at the Critics Choice, Golden Globe, SAG, New York Film Critics Circle, Los Angeles Film Critics Association and National Society of Film Critics awards.","Blanchett named in open letter by the director's 28-year-old adopted daughter Dylan Farrow .

Edna Martin is 78 year old pensioner who loves knitting, organ music - and a toy boy half her age. The divorced grandmother from Weston-super-Mare met husband Simon, 39, through their shared passion for organ music and they both agree it was 'love at first sight'. The couple have made headlines around the world due to their 39 year age gap and now they are sharing their story in a new Channel 5 documentary. Scroll down for video . 39 year age gap: Edna and Simon Martin couldn't be happier . Edna's children are all older than Simon, who was a 30-year-old who had never kissed a girl and was still living with his parents in Birmingham when they first met. He admits: 'I did like ladies but I hadn't had any success in any way.' That all changed when he met Edna, who was nearly 70 at the time. They snuck off from an organ recital to share their first kiss under the pier and have been inseparable ever since. 'I can't imagine being without Simon, he's the first thing I see in the morning and the last thing I see at night,' Edna said. Edna admitted their age gap 'doesn't affect things in the bedroom', while Simon jokes they are 'at it like rabbits.' He added: 'You have to have a sense of humour about sex as it's a ridiculous thing anyway.' Toy boy: Joan, 68, and Phil, 29, met through Facebook . But despite their active sex life, there will never be children. Something that Edna feared could have kept them apart. 'I told him to leave me because it would mean he couldn't have children - but thank god he didn't,' she said. Edna needs a walking aid to get around and she said her lack of mobility can be frustrating. But Simon says it doesn't bother him and he doesn't notice the physical differences in their ages, nor worries that he could face decades without his true love. He explains: 'I have physically disabilities which mean my body has aged faster than someone else my age. So I will probably have a shorter life span. We'll just keep going as long as we can.' While their union may be unusual, it is not unique, as the Channel 5 documentary also shares the story of pensioner Joan Lloyd, 68, who has had a relationship with Phil Absolom, 29 for the past 18 months. 'I wanted to be with someone who make me laugh and didn't make me feel like I'm older' The couple live together in Abergele, North Wales, after meeting via Facebook. Joan had been married to her husband, David, for 50 years and they had four children . together. When he died of cancer four years ago, he made her . promise to keep living her life to the full and not become a lonely . widow. She explains: 'On his death bed he told me to get new boobs and a lovely toy boy. He told me, ""I'll . be looking down on you smiling, saying good for you Joan"". He made me . write it down in front of him and sign it.' Joan fulfilled her husband's dying wishes by getting a breast enlargement and went online to seek a new man. She said: 'I get on with young people so I wanted a toy boy. I was going for someone who would make me laugh and not make me feel like I'm older. I went on Facebook and got 700 messages from guys but they weren't what I wanted.' However, she was then contacted by Phil. He said: 'When I first saw picture I was attracted to her so I sent her a message and it started from there.' In love: Both pensioners say being with a younger man makes them feel young and happy . Joan said: 'I thought, he's gorgeous, I wouldn't mind him.' The couple went on a date and hit it off instantly. 'My legs were like jelly I thought, ""he's the one I'm having,""' Joan recalls. Now she says they can't keep their hands off each other. 'We do a lot of kissing and cuddling. I do like having sex with him and he does as much as he can,' she said. 'I love him to bits and we get on so well.' Joan said she likes to try and stay young for Phil by exercising daily and using sunbeds as she believes a tan gives her a youthful look. She also likes to dress in 'sexy style clothes'. She explains: 'I like young stuff. People will say . you are too old to wear something like that leave it to the younger . people but that's not how I feel. I don't want to look like mutton . dressed as lamb but if I can dress young and it looks nice I'm me, I'll . buy it.' The pensioner admits her desire to hold back the years is part insecurity over Phil leaving her for a younger woman, particularly if he wants to start a family. 'I liked her straight away but I was only 16, she was 45 I never . thought in a million years that was going to happen' But he assured her: 'It costs half a million to bring up a kid today. Think what I could do with that.' She also found reassurance from his mother who was surprisingly content about her son dating a woman more than twice his age. 'I was insecure I kept thinking he would leave me. But I spoke to his mum . and she told me she had never seen him so much in love and that I . shouldn't worry,' Joan said. Phil added that his mother is happy he found Joan as he needs constant support because he has epilepsy. Caused controversy: Marilyn first met husband William when he was 16 and she was 45 . He said: 'My previous relationship . with girls my own age were terrible because they said they could handle . my epilepsy but deep down they couldn't. They would panic if I had a bad . fit. If I haven't met someone like Joan I would have been single for . the rest of my life. My mum is glad Joan looks after me.' But . another couple featured on the show haven't had as much understanding from . friends and family because of the difference in their years. Marilyn, 53, from West Sussex, met her husband William Buttigieg, 24, when he was only 16 as he was a friend of the family. She was a 45-year-old mother at the time who was struggling with the symptoms of ME. William . said: 'I liked her straight away but I was only 16, she was 45 I never . thought in a million years that was going to happen.' However, one day when William was visiting the family he went to see Marilyn to check she was ok when she was having a lie down because of her condition and a kiss 'just happened.' The pair soon became an item and Marilyn said she had no regrets despite the shock it caused to their friends and family. Endured nasty comments: The couple, now aged 53 and 24, wish people would be more accepting of their relationship . She said: '16 is a legal age. Men have been doing it for generations and getting away with it.' She added that William was mature for his age and not like other 16-year-olds. He has certainly had to grow up fast thanks to the relationship which has led to him facing taunts and even once being physically attacked. He said: 'Quickly my friends all disappeared, they all turned their backs on . me. It was like society rejected us. It was like we had a disease and . people would catch it.' Marilyn added: 'People used to shout at him ""granny shagger"" and make nasty comments to . me saying it's dirty and wrong. A few times we've had to call the . police. Once some men set upon him.' The couple - like the others featured in the documentary - wish people would be more understanding and accepting of their love. 'We are just two normal people who fell in love with each other - just with an age gap,' Marilyn said.

A Utah couple who run a carpet cleaning business were found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning on Saturday night in a tragic accident while working at a house. Maria Lopez-Landaderde, 38, and Jose Lito-Solorzano, 44, were found unresponsive in a West Jordan home about 6.30pm. They were discovered by three people who had been planning to move into the residence and were waiting in a truck with their belongings nearby, according to Fox 13. Tragic: Victims Maria Lopez-Landaderde, 38, and Jose Lito-Solorzano, 44, seen here in a Facebook. They died of carbon monoxide poisoning on Saturday . Maria Lopez-Landaderde, 38, and Jose Lito-Solorzano, 44, were found unresponsive in a West Jordan home on Saturday. Fire officials found their carpet cleaning van parked inside the garage with engine on and door shut . The couple were found by three tenants who were waiting in a truck nearby for the all-clear to move in . Authorities believe the victims were preparing the home for the new tenants when they fell unconscious inside the residence at 6057 Miners Mesa Drive. Fire department officials said when they arrived, a van appearing to belong to the carpet cleaning company was parked inside the garage. They said the van was running and the garage door was closed. 'There was an auxiliary motor that runs that they use as they clean the carpet and it appears that carbon monoxide was getting into the home, causing the two adults to become unconscious and suffer from carbon monoxide poisoning,' West Jordan Fire Chief Marc Mcelreath told. The new tenants, who asked not to be identified, said they had been waiting to get approval to begin moving in. Maria Lopez-Landaderde, 38, and Jose Lito-Solorzano, 44, were found unresponsive in a West Jordan home they were cleaning on Saturday night . Police investigate the carpet cleaning van found in the garage of a West Jordan home on Saturday . See video here ... After they didn't receive any word, they went to the home and found the victims in the first floor. The couple were transported to Jordan Valley Hospital in critical condition. They were pronounced dead sometime after being admitted. Investigators say carbon monoxide levels reached a lethal amount and there was not enough ventilation in the home. Carbon monoxide (CO) is a gas that has no odor or color. It is found in combustion fumes, such as those made by cars and trucks, lanterns, stoves, gas ranges and heating systems. CO from these fumes can build up in places that don't have a good flow of fresh air. People and animals are easily poisoned by breathing them in, with many cases resulting in death. The most common symptoms of CO poisoning are   - Headache   - Dizziness   - Weakness   - Nausea   - Vomiting   - Chest pain   - Confusion . It is often hard to tell if someone has CO poisoning, because the symptoms may be like those of other illnesses. People who are sleeping or intoxicated can die from CO poisoning before they have symptoms. A CO detector can warn you if you have high levels of CO in your home.","Maria Lopez-Landaderde, 38, and Jose Lito-Solorzano, 44, run a carpet cleaning business in Utah .

Abuse: Former Delaware pediatrician Melvin Morse plans to testify in his trial which started yesterday. Morse is being accused of waterboarding his 11-year-old stepdaughter . A girl who claims she was waterboarded by her mother's companion, a former pediatrician, told a Delaware jury on Monday the man held her face under a running faucet several times as punishment. Swiveling back and forth in the witness chair and smiling at times, the 12-year-old recounted how Melvin Morse, who she learned only recently was not her father, punished her in a variety of ways, including waterboarding and putting his hands over her nose and mouth. The girl said Morse used the term waterboarding, and she was punished for spilling milk, shaking a ketchup bottle and vomiting into a cat's litter box after being made to eat too much. 'Sometimes I think I heard him yell ""Die!'"" she said, describing the waterboarding. Morse pleaded not guilty to child endangerment and assault charges following his 2012 arrest for dragging his stepdaughter across the driveway by her ankles. After being interviewed by authorities, the girl revealed that she had been waterboarded by her stepfather on four occasions and that her mother did nothing to stop the punishment. The girl's mother, Pauline Morse, was also arrested at the time but plead guilty last May to misdemeanor charges and agreed to testify against her ex-husband. The two divorced several years prior to the abuse, but continued to live as husband and wife. Morse was the eminent researcher on near-death experiences in children and had appeared on Oprah, Good Morning America and Larry King Live to discuss his research. He is the author of two books on near-death experiences, 'Closer to the Light' and 'Transformed by the Light'. Expert: Before his arrest, Morse, right, was the eminent researcher on near-death experiences in children. He was interviewed as an expert by Larry King and Oprah and authored two books on the subject . High profile: In 1992, he was also interviewed by Oprah Winfrey, pictured holding up a copy of his book . But his medical license was revoked after his neighbor reported him for child abuse two years ago. He worked as a pediatrician in a private practice in Milton, Delaware. His stepdaughter, then 11, told the . neighbor she refused to get out of the car when they returned home, so . Morse forcibly brought her into the house by dragging her by her ankles . across the gravel driveway and then spanked her. In an interview following the initial driveway incident, the girl told authorities about how her stepfather would waterboard her as punishment for bad behavior. He would hold her under faucets in the . kitchen, bathroom and bathtub so that water would shoot up her nose, . mimicking the sensation of drowning - a technique best-known for its use . on suspected terrorists following the 9/11 attacks. She said her mother Pauline did nothing to stop the torture. A changed woman: The girl's mother Pauline Morse was also arrested (mugshot left) for letting the abuse happen but plead guilty last May and agreed to testify in her ex-husband's trial. As of last May, she was still working to regain custody of her two daughters . Waterboarding is a form of torture in which water is poured over someone's face, simulating the sensation of drowning. A cloth is often placed over the captive's face so their breathing is restricted for up to 40 seconds as water is continually poured onto them.It dates back to the Spanish Inquisition, when it was a preferred interrogation technique as it leaves no marks on the person's body.The practice can cause extreme pain and distress, damage to lungs, brain damage from oxygen deprivation, long-lasting psychological damage and death. It can also cause broken bones as the captive attempts to escape.In 2007, it emerged that the CIA had waterboarded three Al-Qaeda suspects in 2002 and 2003. The Bush administration allowed it as a form of interrogation by narrowing the definition of torture.In 2009, President Obama banned its use, but the Department of Defense has refused to say whether it uses the technique as a form of training on its troops. On one occasion Morse even threatened . he 'was going to wrap her in a blanket and do it so that she could not . move'. Another time he allegedly told her she 'could go five minutes . without brain damage'. The girl added that Morse would . 'sometimes look away while he did it and would become afraid that he . would lose track of time and she would die'. After . the alleged torture, she would 'go outside and cry', but Morse would . come outside and hold her nose and mouth with his hand, according to . court documents. 'He would . tell her she was lucky he did not use duct tape,' police noted. 'He . would not let go until she lost feeling and collapsed to the ground.' The girl added that she never knew what she had done to be punished and felt frightened. Her . then 5-year-old sister was also interviewed and said that, although . she witnessed the abuse to her sister, she was never targeted 'because . she is too young for it'. At the time of the arrest, police investigated the possibility that Morse was using his stepdaughter for his research. Both Melvin and Pauline Morse were released on $14,500 bail after their August 2012 arrest, but barred from seeing the children. The 12-year-old girl on Monday recounted how she decided to run away the morning after the driveway incident, saying Morse had punished her that night and had warned her ""there will be more."" 'I was scared he was going to hurt me.... I thought he meant, like, more pain,' she said. Prosecutors have introduced photographs of scratches and bruises on the girl, but she said Monday that several of them came from a bicycle as she pushed it along the road when she ran away from home. Jurors were shown four homemade videos documenting Morse's encounters with the girl about her behavior. In the first video, Morse repeatedly asked why she doesn't try to 'fix the damage' after she misbehaves. 'Why don't you try to repair things when you do something wrong, sweetheart?' he calmly asked the girl. Taking work home: At the time of his arrest, police investigated the idea that Morse performed the waterboarding as part of his research . In another video, Morse asked the girl why she couldn't recognize that it was 'a major crime' to break the rules of the house. 'Has your therapist ever told you that you have to obey your parents?' he asked the girl, who responds affirmatively. 'It kind of gets on my nerves the way he talked to me,' she testified Monday when asked about the video. The girl also said Morse gave her antidepressants and kept a ""behavior book"" in which he added or subtracted points to determine her disciplinary 'level.' Level One included no television, no allowance and not being allowed to eat with the family. Level Two allowed her to eat with the family; Level Three allowed her to choose what kind of sandwich she wanted for lunch. The girl said she never made it to Level Four. The girl also said Morse subjected her to other punishment, including being forced to stand with arms outstretched and her head against a wall, and being confined to her room without access to the bathroom, forcing her to wet herself or use her toy box as a toilet. 'I tried to stay out of his way so he wouldn't see me and remember something and make me do stuff,' she said. The girl also acknowledged that she twice attempted to contact Morse after his arrest, including sending him an email in December 2012. 'Are you okay. I'm okay. I accept all apologies,' she wrote. In a voicemail, the girl told Morse she missed him. 'I was confused and I was wondering if he was feeling the same way,' she explained. '... I just kind of wanted to say hello and I miss you.' Pauline Morse had been allowed visitation . when she struck a plea deal last May in which she agreed to testify . against her husband in his trial. At the time she was working to regain . custody of her two daughters and her public defender Dean Johnson said . she had 'totally changed' following her arrest. 'She has independence of thought...whereas before Melvin made the decisions and she went along,' Mr Johnson said in May. According . to her Facebook, Pauline Morse had worked as a researcher and the . treasurer of her ex-husband's non-profit, The Institute for the . Scientific Study of Consciousness, but is now a personal assistant at a . salon.

Scientists at Cambridge University said this might be the brain’s way of exercising caution when life seems to be spinning out of our control. Adversity: Research shows that when we feel powerless, we think objects are much heavier than they are . In one experiment, volunteers’ sense of power was measured by asking them questions such as whether they thought people listened to their views. The men and women then lifted boxes of books and estimated their weight. Finally, they answered questions about their mood. Mood and gender did not affect the results, but sense of power did. The less powerful someone felt, the more they thought the boxes weighed, the Journal of Experimental Psychology reports. Volunteers who felt powerless estimated the boxes to be around 20 per cent heavier than those who felt in control.

It is thought that in tough times, we take steps to conserve vital resources. Seeing things as heavier than they are could deter us from using up precious energy. Lead researcher Eun Hee Lee said: ‘Not much was known about how power influences perceptual experiences in everyday life. ‘This research demonstrates that people’s social role, as indicated by a sense of social power, or lack thereof, can change the way they see the physical environment.’ In a similar vein, studies have shown we perceive a hill as being steeper if we are carrying a backpack or have listened to sad music. However, a sugar rush - from eating glucose - makes a slope appear more gentle, researchers have found.","Sense of power measured by asking volunteers if they feel listened to .

A golf star who died when her car careened off the road and hit a tree in Alabama was on her way home from a night of drinking. Former LPGA . player Danielle Downey, 33, lost control of her vehicle after speeding past a motorist on Lee Road 57 in Auburn about 10pm Thursday. She plunged into a tree and was thrown from the car as it rolled several times. Downey was rushed to East Alabama Medical Center  but died from major head injuries. Tragic: Danielle Downey, 33, died in a car crash late Thursday in Auburn, Alabama, on her way home from dinner . Golfing champion: Downey, a New York native, was a three-time All American . According to an Alabama Department of Public Safety crash report released last night, Downey had been drinking with friends at a restaurant before the fatal crash. Her close mate Diana Ramage said she had tried to take Downey's car keys so she wouldn't drive home, fearing she was too intoxicated to get behind the wheel. News of the New York native's tragic death has shocked her friends and family, who praised Downey's generosity and selflessness. Downey was in her second season as Auburn's director of golf operations and filled in for coach Kim Evans during the 2012-13 season after Evans was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. 'I'm absolutely devastated,' Evans told Sporting News. 'Danielle meant so much to me, the girls and this program. Not only did she give much of her life to Auburn as a student-athlete and as a mentor to these young women, but she was so instrumental to this team during some tough times over the past year. Danielle was like a daughter to me.' Tragic: According to the Alabama Department of Public Safety crash report, Downey's friend Diana Ramage (pictured) tried to take the ex-golfer's car keys from her because she feared she was too drunk to drive . The Rochester native, nicknamed 'Deuce', was a three-time All-American who finished second in the 2002 NCAA tournament. Downey had seven top-10 finishes and one tournament victory on the Futures Tour. She finished in the money 15 times on the LPGA Tour from 2006 through 2010, including a career-best fourth at the 2008 Bell Micro LPGA Classic. Downey returned to school and graduated in May 2013 with a degree in health promotion. 'This is a tragic and devastating loss for Danielle's family, our student-athletes and staff and the entire Auburn family,' Auburn athletic director Jay Jacobs said. 'Danielle cared deeply about people and she was loved by all who knew her. She impacted a lot of lives here as a player and a member of our staff.' Scene: Police said Downey, 33, died on Thursday night after speeding past a motorist on Lee Road 57 in Auburn and careening off the road into a tree . 'Danielle would give you the shirt off her back,' said Auburn alumna Nicole Hage. 'And if she didnâ€™t have a shirt, sheâ€™d spend all day finding one for you.'

Self-proclaimed 'Tiger Mom' Amy Chua has denied accusations she is racist for arguing eight ethnic groups - including her own - are superior to others. The Chinese-American, who caused controversy in 2011 by claiming Chinese women were better mothers, has released a new book which states eight cultural groups have traits which make them more successful than most. 'There is nothing racial about it. Successful groups include people of all different skin colors,' Chua said, according to The Sunday Times. 'There are black and Hispanic groups outperforming the national average; there are white and Asian groups mired in poverty . . . Wilful blindness to facts is rarely good policy.' 'It's not racist': Chinese-American Amy Chua and her Jewish husband Jed Rubenfeld defended their new book 'Triple Package' on the Today Show this morning . The 51-year-old Yale professor and her Jewish husband, Jed Rubenfeld, this morning appeared on TODAY to slam critics who say their latest book - 'The Triple Package' - is 'full blown eugenics pushing racist'. 'The focus on groups is what's making everybody so upset,' Chua told TODAY's Savannah Guthrie. 'The groups actually change over time. The groups successful today won't be 10 years from now.' The couple, who have two children, controversially argue that certain groups do much better than others in America because of three elements: a superiority complex, insecurity and impulse control. These 'superior' groups include Cubans, Nigerians, Jews, Mormons, Indians, Lebanese, and Chinese-Americans. Chinese Chua and Jewish Rubenfeld belong to two of the exceptional eight . groups. On the defensive: In 'The Triple Package', Amy Chua (left) and her husband Jed Rubenfeld (right) lay out their manifesto for how America will compete on the world stage . Family: Chinese-American author Amy Chua (center) in Shanghai with her family, 18-year-old Sophia, 14-year-old Louisa, her husband Jed Rubenfeld and her parents, to promote her book, Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother in 2011 . Critics say the book perpetuates racial stereotypes, but the high-powered pair said it simply takes a look at what triggers human motivation. 'Any time you talk about groups in America, there's going to be sensitivity, but our book is the polar opposite of racist... (it) is written to prove that what propels success has nothing to do with race,' Rubenfeld, also a Yale law professor, said. 'It’s not innate, it’s not biological; it comes down to three qualities that are open to anyone of any background.' The superiority complex is a belief, which a parent can instil, that you're exceptional. Insecurity is a feeling that what you've done is not good enough, while impulse control is the ability to resist temptation. The couple claim that the combination of these traits - 'the triple package' - can help some groups accelerate in American culture, but these are not innate, biological qualities. 'I am not racist': Yale professor Amy Chu dubbed herself a 'Tiger Mom' in 2011 . 'The Triple Package': The new book by couple Amy Chua and Jed Rubenfeld argues that certain groups do better than others in America . Chua believes anyone can be successful but must help themselves. Chua became a media sensation in 2011 when The Wall Street Journal published an extract from her book 'Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother'. Although she was raised in the Midwest, Chua used her Chinese heritage and some of the worst stereotypes of Chinese women - cold, rigid and hostile towards their own children - to criticize Western methods of parenting. Chua wrote unabashedly about calling one of her two daughters 'garbage' for being rude and refusing to let her girls watch TV or participate in school plays or have sleepovers. While it became a best-seller, Chua’s book was roundly criticized for being 'racist' and perpetuating negative stereotypes about race. Chua's latest book takes her premise a step further, with commentators saying its exploration of family seeks to play on the growing fear of the middle-class never booming again. Controversially, Chua and her husband say that African-Americans don't make the superior race list because the Civil Rights Movement destroyed their chance of any superiority. 'In this paradoxical sense, equality isn’t fair to African-Americans,' they write. 'Superiority is the one narrative that America has relentlessly denied or ground out of its black population.' Chua and her husband ultimately declare that the point of their book 'is the promise of a day when there are no longer any successful groups in the United States - only successful individuals.'","Chinese-American 'Tiger Mom' Amy Chua has defended her new parenting book, 'The Triple Package'

The Utah mother who claims her otherwise healthy teenage son died because of side-effects from a flu-shot has revealed her boy pleaded with doctor's to save him before he lapsed into a coma. As she made the difficult decision to release heartbreaking pictures of her son, Chandler, 19, languishing in his hospital bed, Lori Webb described how scared he became as his health rapidly deteriorated following his routine vaccination on October 15th. Suffering violent episodes of vomiting and debilitating headaches, Chandler's condition worsened in the week after the shot until he was placed on life-support at Intermountain Medical Center in Murray, Utah, begging, 'Doctor's, save me.' Scroll Down for Video . Coma: Chandler Webb, 19, lies in his hospital bed in Intermountain Medical Center in Murray, Utah - from which he never awoke and passed away on Tuesday - just five weeks after he was given a flu-shot . Sports loving Chandler, was given his first ever shot last month after agreeing to travel on a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. However, the day after receiving the flu and tuberculosis shots, the Brighton High School graduate began suffering severe vomiting and was eventually admitted to hospital in Murray where he fell into a coma after a week of unexplained illness. Despite doctor's best efforts they could not diagnose him, despite putting him through a battery of tests. Officially Chandler's direct cause of death was swelling of the brain, but speaking to Fox News, Lori explained that she believes the vaccination was the reason - and that doctors should have asked sooner if her son had recently been given a shot. Mother's love: Lori Webb lies with her son Chandler in his hospital bed in pictures she has released to highlight what she believes the dangers are in getting a flu-shot . 'What attacked his brain happened so quickly within 15 hours,' Webb said on Fox and Friends. 'From one CT scan to the next, there was so much pressure and swelling on the brain that it crushed his brain stem.' Chandler was ultimately taken off life support after a month in a coma and he died on Tuesday after 28 days in the hospital. 'He was sicker than he has ever been in his life. He says he's never shook so hard his whole life. He had the worst headache, threw up, and he slept for about two and a half days and didn't eat anything during that time,' said Webb to the Salt Lake Tribune. Medical mystery: Chandler Webb with a friend at home in Utah - Chandler tragically died after he was given a flu-shot five weeks ago before he embarked on a Mormon mission . Friends: Chandler Webb (far right) with two friends at home in Utah - Chandler's mother has made the difficult decision to release pictures of him as he lies dying in hospital . According to a report from the Salt Lake Tribune, Webb has declined an autopsy, as she believes that a pending brain biopsy will reveal Chandler’s cause of death. Chandler's doctors have not discussed his case and public health officials repeated that the vaccine is safe and rarely has serious side effects. Chandler's medical team, which included six neurologists at Intermountain Medical Center in Murray, tested him for every conceivable illness - including Lyme disease and sexually transmitted ones. 'They checked every virus, every fungus, ever tick, west Nile they even checked for rabies,' said Lori.  'And they can't find anything...it was the most senseless, senseless, death.' 'This was his first flu shot,' Lori said. 'He’d never had one before.' 'I hate this. 'I hate that I have to bury my son.' Tragic: Lori Webb with her son Chandler who died on November 19th after spending a month in a coma - which his mother believes was triggered by a flu-shot . Utah Department of Health spokesman Tom Hudachko said the state is aware of the case but can’t verify the cause of death nor whether it is investigating because of patient confidentiality. He added that the health department has no record of anyone in Utah dying from a reaction to the vaccine, he said. 'Like with other medical procedures, there can be side effects and adverse reactions,' he said. 'In the vast majority of those cases the side effects are not very severe — soreness at the injection site, low fever, achiness. Occasionally, yes, there are more severe side effects from receiving the vaccine.' 130 million people nationwide, nearly half of all Americans, decide to get the flu vaccine every year and side effects are extremely rare. Fit and Healthy: Chandler Webb was described by . his mother as the picture of health and would visit the gym five-days a . week in an effort to stay fit . Out of those 130 million people, about 140 people report serious side-effects each year. Chandler Webb was described as a healthy teen, who visited the gym five days a week before he fell ill. Lori Webb described how as her son was taken off life-support she cut his hair for the last time and told him the story of 'The Three Billy Goats Gruff', just as she did when he was a child. 'I can’t describe how hard it is to lose a child,' she said. 'We can’t wrap our heads around this… it’s so bizarre.'","Chandler Webb, 19, fell ill one day after being given a flu-shot before a Mormon mission .

Google must move its mystery barge from a construction site on an island in the middle of the San Francisco Bay because the permits are not in order, a state official said Monday. The notice came after the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission investigated numerous complaints about the construction of the floating, four-story building, commission executive director Larry Goldzband said. The investigation found that neither the Treasure Island Development Authority nor the city of San Francisco had applied for required permits for the work to be done at the site. Barge out: A state agency says Google must move its mystery barge from a construction site on an island in the middle of the San Francisco Bay because the permits are not in order . Goldzband said Google can resolve the issue by moving the barge to one of the fully permitted construction facilities in the San Francisco Bay. 'It needs to move,' he said. Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Preliminary planning documents submitted to the port last fall showed plans for Google to build an interactive space for people to learn about technology. Has to move: Google is erecting a four-story structure in the heart of the San Francisco Bay but is managing to conceal its purpose by constructing it on docked barges instead of on land, where city building permits and public plans are mandatory . Mystery buildings: The barge is one of three mysterious floating structures that have sparked online speculation. There are three secretive structures, two in San Francisco and one Portland, Maine . The documents ended months of speculation that the barge would be a party boat, data storage center or a store for Google to sell its Internet-connected glasses. Google has had little to say about the barge or another vessel off the East Coast. In November, the company issued a statement that said, 'Although it's still early days and things may change, we're exploring using the barge as an interactive space where people can learn about new technology.' Goldzband said the construction in San Francisco Bay was not authorized by the agency, and the Treasure Island Development Authority, which allowed the project, could face fines and enforcement proceedings. The disclosure by the California agency marked the second set of permit problems for the barge project. Late last year, work was halted after the Coast Guard said additional permits were needed.","Google is being forced to move a barge it has on a construction site in the middle of the San Francisco Bay .

"PUBLISHED: . 09:23 EST, 1 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:42 EST, 1 December 2013 . Jill Kelley, the woman made famous for triggering the investigation that ended with General David Petraeus' resignation as head of the CIA, is taking small steps back into public life. The Florida socialite and her husband Scott helped pass out Thanksgiving meals for their charity Heart for the Homeless Thursday, after being forced to skip the event last year due to the public attention involving the scandal. Last year, Kelley complained to a contact at the FBI about cyber-stalking which revealed an affair between Petraeus and his biographer, Paula Broadwell. 'We could not leave the house in light of the scandal. We had to take a year off. It was sad that these people suffered,' Kelley told the New York Post's Page Six. Back in public life: Socialite Jill Kelley handed out Thanksgiving dinners to homeless vets on Thursday as part of her re-entry to the Tampa social scene . 'Many of these homeless men are young vets who just got back from Afghanistan. They are living in their cars . . . The homeless population has changed dramatically. One [man] had been a fighter pilot,' Kelley added . Kelley's return to the Tampa social scene coincides with her recent lawsuit against top US officials, accusing them of a 'smear campaign'. Kelley and her husband originally filed a lawsuit last June on the grounds that the FBI and Department of Defense violated the federal privacy act by leaking their personal information to the press. News breaker: Kelley became a part of the news last year when her reports of cyber-stalking revealed an affair between General David Petraeus and author Paula Broadwell, which brought his career as CIA chief to an end . But in this new lawsuit, the Kelleys claim that their names, emails and personal information were leaked to the press following Petraeus' resignation on November 9, 2012. Among those named are Deputy FBI Director Sean Joyce, former bureau director Robert Mueller, Attorney General Eric Holder and other top officials who Kelley claims made decisions on the investigation into the Petraeus scandal 'based on the timing of the 2012 presidential election', NBC reported. Jill Kelley was under intense media scrutiny at the time of Petraeus' resignation due to her reputation for throwing parties for military and intelligence big wigs at her Tampa home near MacDill Air Force Base - headquarters of U.S. Central Command. Fighting back: Kelley and her husband Scott recently filed a lawsuit against top US officials accusing them of releasing their private information to the press following Petraeus' resignation . The leaks placed the socialite in the middle of an avalanche of unfavorable publicity and as a result, she shouldered the blame as the villain in the downfall of Petraeus and General John Allen, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, the lawsuit states. The lawsuit reads: '[T]he government was not legally entitled to treat the Kelleys’ like criminals, pry into and disclose their personal communications, violate their privacy, and disseminate confidential records as well as false information about them.' In September, the Obama administration sought to dismiss the lawsuit. The Justice Department declined to comment to NBC on Friday about the amended lawsuit. The suit claims the leaks violated the Privacy Act, which was enacted in 1974 after revelations of illegal surveillance by federal agencies in the Watergate scandal. The Justice Department said in a court filing that Kelley has failed to present any facts suggesting that the FBI and the Pentagon flagrantly disregarded her privacy rights. In an act that triggered the criminal probe resulting in Petraeus' forced resignation, Kelley told the FBI in May 2012 that she and several U.S. top military officers had been the recipients of anonymous harassing emails. Kelley and her husband 'sought to do the right thing by reporting the facts' to the FBI, the lawsuit says. But 'rather than protect the Kelleys' privacy interests as the law and their duty required, defendants instead willfully and maliciously thrust the Kelleys into the maw of public scrutiny concerning one of the most widely reported sex scandals to rock the United States government'. Some of the anonymous emails ultimately traced to Paula Broadwell were sent to Allen. Allegations: The suit says the FBI did not provide Kelley the security protection a victim is entitled to because the bureau wanted to avoid attention before the upcoming presidential election . The messages included notes on the general's plans to see Kelley in Washington the following week. Allen was concerned about how anyone else would know about his personal plans. One email mentioned Petraeus and an upcoming social event and military and intelligence meeting with NATO leaders in Washington. The emails to the generals claimed Kelley was up to no good and impugned her motives for befriending the military leaders. The lawsuit says the U.S. government 'unforgivably transformed Mrs Kelley's reputation from that of a respected business and community leader'. According to the lawsuit, the FBI Washington cyber division and FBI Deputy Director Sean Joyce directed agents in the Tampa Field office to treat the Kelleys' case differently than normal criminal investigations. Former CIA Director David Petraeus shakes hands with author Paula Broadwell. It was later revealed that the two were having an affair . For example, the suit says, the FBI did not provide Kelley with security protection to which a victim is entitled because the bureau wanted to avoid attention before the upcoming presidential election. The lawsuit also says the FBI in Washington directed investigating agents not to proceed with a scheduled effort to interview Broadwell once the agents had determined she was the stalker. Government officials violated the Constitution's ban on unreasonable searches in its review of Kelley's emails, the suit claims. It alleges they have suffered financial losses because of the government's actions. They are seeking monetary damages and an apology, among other things. In the fallout from the scandal, Kelley was stripped of her role as a honorary consul for South Korea. She was forced to return her vanity car registration plates and banned from MacDill Airforce Base.","The Tampa, Florida socialite volunteered for her charity Heart for the Homeless Thursday after having to skip the event last year .

Smart clothes that change their colour and shape according to the wearer's movement have been developed by Canadian experts. The 'Karma Chameleon' project, launched by Concordia University in Montreal, weaves electronic fabric into clothes allowing the storage of energy from the body. The new lines by the team behind the innovation include a dress which can change shape and colour and a shirt which can charge a mobile phone. Clothes that change their colour and shape according to the wearer's movement have been developed by Canadian experts. The Acrobat Dress is a transformative garment from the prototype collection . Prof Joanna Berzowska, of the Department of Design and Computation Arts at Concordia University in Montreal, Canada, said it would be a long time before the clothes hit the high street. She said: 'We won't see such garments in stores for another 20 or 30 years, but the practical and creative possibilities are exciting. 'Our goal is to create garments that can transform in complex and surprising ways - far beyond reversible jackets, or shirts that change colour in response to heat. 'Thatâ€™s why the project is called Karma . Chameleon.' Prof Berzowska said the major innovation of this research project is the ability to embed electronic or computer functions within the fibre itself. Rather than being simply attached to the textile, the electronic components are woven into these new composite fibres. The fibres consist of multiple layers of polymers, which, when stretched and drawn out to a small diameter, begin to interact with each other. Prof Joanna Berzowska said the major innovation of this research project is the ability to embed these electronic or computer functions within the fibre itself . The use of smart fabrics has already been considered for a wide range of uses, including clothes which can warm the wearer with electronically conducting materials. One other suggested use is as a performance device - where the state and . shape of the fabric is controlled by someone other than the wearer. Soldiers' uniforms could soon use the special yarn, which would be woven directly into the clothing. Although the garments designed by the university are still years from being made available, prototype designs have been developed to show the concepts in action. Ms Berzowska's ideas will be presented at the Smart Fabrics 2013 conference this week in San Francisco.","'Karma Chameleon' project weaves electronic fabrics into clothes .

An 18-year-old who was confined to a room in his home with little food for years was so malnourished he still had his baby teeth and looked like a pre-teen, a detective testified Thursday. 'I thought he was a 12-year-old boy,' said Georgia Detective Kevin Morgan at the bond hearing of Paul and Sheila Comer, who were arrested last month on charges of cruelty to children and false imprisonment . MItch Comer was just 5' 1"" and weighed only 87 pounds when he was found wandering around downtown Los Angeles. Shackled: Paul and Sheila Comer are led into Georgia courtroom for a hearing. They have been charged with child abuse . The pair were shackled in chains and in stripey jumpsuits when they arrived at court today . He was so neglected, his skin was translucent and he told investigators he hadn't seen the sun in two years, Morgan testified. The teen's parents appeared in Paulding County Magistrate Court today for a probable cause hearing dressed in orange and white striped jail suits with their ankles and wrists chained. Mitch told investigators he was confined to a bathroom and bedroom for years and wasn't fed often, occasionally getting soup or cereal but little of substance, Morgan said. Arrest warrants filed in Georgia say the . Comers 'made Mitch kneel on the floor, bend his head and place his . forehead against the wall, and place his hands behind his head for long . periods of time'. The Comers' two daughters, who are 11 and 13, told investigators they heard him cry and scream for food often, Morgan said. Paul and Sheila Comer, who had lived in the house 14 months, admitted to investigators that Mitch was confined to the room. In jail: Paul and Sheila Marie Comer allegedly starving and maltreating 18-year-old Mitch, who was found wandering around a bus station more than 2,000 miles from home . Detectives said the 18-year-old boy had practically translucent skin and looked no more than 12 or 13 years old. Pictured, police searching the family home . 'They both conceded that that was his life,' Morgan said. 'He lived in that room for years.' The boy was kept in such seclusion . that his two younger sisters in the same house did not know what he . looked like, the authorities revealed. 'The . sisters haven't seen the brother in over two years,' said Paulding's . Cpl. Ashley Henson. 'They didn't even know what color his hair was.' Paul . Comer told investigators he brought Mitch Comer food at 7am noon and . 7pm each day and fed him whatever the family was eating. On September 11, a retired police sergeant working security at a downtown Los Angeles bus station noticed Mitch Comer. Police . decided to investigate further because the teen looked much younger . than the 18 years he claimed, Los Angeles police said last month. Parents: Mr Comer and the boy's mother Sheila Marie were arrested on six charges of child abuse and one charge of false imprisonment on September 12, at their home near Dallas . The teen told authorities he had suffered from years of abuse after being taken out of school in the eighth grade. He . told authorities his stepfather gave him $200 and a list of homeless . shelters before he was put on a bus to Los Angeles on his 18th birthday. Paul Comer told investigators Mitch Comer wanted to be an actor. Mr Comer and the boy's mother Sheila Marie were arrested on six charges of child abuse and one charge of false imprisonment on September 12, at their home near Dallas. As an 18-year-old, Mitch was not eligible for foster care, but has been taken in by a local family and is 'doing well', detectives said. He did not know his own address, but his parents . were quickly tracked down. The couple’s two daughters have been in protective custody since their parents were arrested, investigators said. The Comers have no prior criminal . history, but were the subject of a 2009 investigation by local . authorities following an abuse allegation when the family lived in . Cherokee County. The case was referred to the Cherokee Sheriff’s Office, but was later closed, and no charges were filed. Neighbours . on the quiet cul-de-sac of two-storey brick and vinyl siding homes, . about 30 miles outside Atlanta, said the couple kept to themselves and were shocked to discover that the family had a son. 'Abuse': Mitch told detectives he was forced to stand against the wall at the family home near Dallas, Georgia, for up to eight hours at a time . The FBI and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation have joined the case, Cpl. Henson added. Mrs Comer’s mother, Diana Powell, of Iowa, said she hadn’t spoken to her daughter in more than a decade and hadn’t seen her grandson since he was a toddler. Powell told the station that she had feared her daughter and husband abused their children but had no direct evidence. 'They mistreated him something terrible. I got on her case about it and she disappeared from my life,’ she said crying. Authorities say that they are just at . the ‘tip of the iceberg’ with the case and more charges could be . brought against the parents. Monica Moore, an investigator with the Paulding County District Attorney’s office, described the 18-year-old victim as small, very timid, and extremely polite. Moore confirmed that a local family had agreed to house the teenager, according to Channel 2. A spokesman from Paulding County Public Schools could also not confirm whether the children have ever been enrolled in the school system. Records show the Comers have lived in almost two dozen different homes during the past two decades. Neighbours said the family had lived at their large Dallas home for at least a few years. Dion Walker and Mea Smith told the Atlanta Journal Constitution that their children had played with the Comers’ daughters over the years but that they had never even seen Mitch. They said they were surprised to learn the family had a son. 'Maybe, when the young girls would stare at us, were they trying to say something?' said Mr Walker. 'Should we have noticed?' Mitch was flown back to Dallas on Wednesday to participate in the investigation and legal proceedings. His stepfather had his own business repairing home appliances, said next-door neighbour John White. They rarely spoke. Mrs Comer never left the house unless she was with her husband, . not even to check the mail, said Mr White. Their two daughters would . sometimes come outside and play, but only in the back yard. Neighbours . assumed the girls didn't go to school either – they never caught the bus . that picked up other children in the cul-de-sac every morning. Neighbors said they had no clue the Comers had a son until a detective came knocking at their doors asking questions last week. 'I had no idea, no clue. There were no signs of a son at all,' said Mr Walker, who has lived next to the Comers for two years. 'The few . occasions we would see them go to the van, it was always the parents and . the two girls.' Walker said police swarmed the Comers' home last week, arresting the parents and taking both girls into protective custody. Walker said the Comer family did not take part in neighbourhood . association meetings and their girls never attended the neighbourhood . Halloween block parties.

Former Health Secretary Andrew Lansley, pictured here in Downing Street, could walk to work in 15 minutes - yet still claims expenses for hotel stays . House of Commons Leader Andrew Lansley claimed £6,000 in expenses for hotel stays in London despite owning a flat just a short walk from Parliament, it emerged today. Official records show the Tory Cabinet minister declared dozens of overnight stays in the Capital paid for by the taxpayer while having a £1million Georgian home in upmarket Pimlico. That is just a mile from Parliament, meaning the former Health Secretary - who earns a ministerial salary of £134,565 - could walk there in 15 minutes. Mr Lansley's constituency home near Royston, South Cambridgeshire, is also just a 50-minute train ride away from London, the Sunday Mirror reported. According to Parliamentary records, Mr Lansley has not rented out his Pimlico property because he has not declared any rental income from it on the Register of Members ­Financial Interests. It is believed one family member lives there - but that the flat has more than one bedroom. Despite this, the Independent Parliamentary Standards . Authority has revealed Mr Lansley claimed £4,978 on hotel stays between April . 2012 and March this year and £972 in the first three months of this financial year. IPSA rules allow MPs to claim £150 per . night for hotels in London and £120 for those ­elsewhere in the country – . with breakfast paid for if the stays are within the capped limits. The Sunday Mirror reported that Latest Land Registry records show he and his second wife Sally paid £270,000 for the London home in December 2000 and that they have a mortgage. The couple also have shares in a company owning the freehold for the building. Mr Lansley has also received expenses for mortgage interest and utility bills for a flat in London, although records do not reveal whether the flat he claimed for was the one in Pimlico. Matthew Sinclair, chief ­executive of . the TaxPayers' ­Alliance, said: 'MPs do need to get the best deal that . they can for taxpayers when making use of accommodation in London. 'Taxpayers will be left wondering why Mr Lansley needs a hotel if he already has ­accommodation in the city. Constant use of pricey hotel rooms is poor value for those who have to the bill. MPs should only check in as a last resort.' It is not the first time questions have been raised about Mr Lansley's expenses. Scenic river walk: It is just a short stroll from the flat Andrew Lansley owns in London's upmarket Pimlico to Westminster, yet despite this he has claimed thousands for hotel stays . Records show Andrew Lansley also received expenses for mortgage interest and utility bills for a flat in London, although records do not reveal whether the flat he claimed for was the one in Pimlico . In 2009, as shadow health secretary he spent £4,000 he claimed back renovating a thatched Tudor country cottage - and sold it shortly afterwards. He redecorated with premium paint in some rooms at a cost of £2,000 and spent more than £500 having the driveway re-shingled. He is then said to have 'flipped' his expenses to a Georgian flat in London and claimed for thousands of pounds in furnishings, including a Laura Ashley sofa. Mr Lansley has . a longstanding relationship with David Cameron, having been his boss . when the Prime Minister took his first political job in the Conservative . research department . But he was dumped by Mr Cameron as Health Secretary last year after a barrage of criticism. A statement from Mr Lansley's office issued to the Sunday Mirror said: 'On the point about the London flat, I can confirm that this does not appear on the Register because it is ­occupied by Mr Lansley's family and thus he does not derive any net income from this.'","Tory Cabinet minister Andrew Lansley declared dozens of overnight stays .

A psychologist . and research leader at Queensland University of Technology studied . children's eating habits and concluded those who grow up with eating . disorders strive to take control over their body - something which they . may feel has somewhat been taken away from them. Children who are allowed to guide their eating through intuition have lower rates of disordered eating . Dr Linda Gilmore. said: 'Parents . should not turn mealtime into a struggle for control, because some . evidence suggests that eating disorders such as anorexia stem from a . desire to take control over one's own body. 'If children are forced to sit at . the table until they eat it this turns into a struggle for who has . power over the child's eating habits which could well set the scene for . later eating problems.' A 2007 study published in the journal Appetite found 85 per cent of parents tried to get children to eat more. Those who use hunger and fullness to guide eating are less likely to diet and binge-eat . Eighty-three per cent of children ate . more than they might otherwise have, with 38 per cent eating moderately . to substantially more. Parents would used reasoning, praise, . and food rewards, mothers being more inclined to praise girls for eating . while fathers would use pressure tactics with boys. The researches concluded that 'it may be . that parents are inadvertently socialising their children to eat past . their internal hunger/satiety cues' and that their data 'reinforces . recommendations that parents should provide nutritious foods and . children, not parents, should decide what and how much of these foods . they eat'.

The ex-girlfriend of Lostprophets singer Ian Watkins claims the paedophile rock musician had fantasies about kidnapping and murdering a baby. Joanne Mjadzelics, 38, claims Watkins' sick behaviour would have eventually degenerated into even more extreme crimes if he had not been caught. Watkins was described as a 'determined and committed paedophile' after he admitted attempting to rape a fan's 11-month-old baby son along with 10 other child sex offences on Tuesday. Horror: Joanne Majic, the ex-girlfriend of Ian Watkins, said he had fantasies about kidnapping and murdering a baby . Miss Mjadzelics had a two year on-off relationship with the rock star from 2006 and as time went on, Watkins revealed his sordid fantasies. In August 2008, after receiving emails from the singer describing sex with an 11-year-old girl and suggestive photographs of a three-year-old, she went to police. She told the Sunday People: 'I’m absolutely sure Ian wouldn’t have stopped at abuse. 'He wanted to rape and kill children. He wanted to rape newborns. 'He even wanted to get me pregnant so he could rape our baby.' The singer, a former boyfriend of BBC presenter Fearne Cotton and model Alexa Chung, also admitted to her he used his Lostprophets fame to turn young girls into ‘Superfans’ willing to allow him to abuse their children. Former lover: Miss Mjadzelics had a two year on-off relationship with the rock star from 2006 and as time went on, Watkins revealed his sordid fantasies . The former lead singer with multi-million selling band Lostprophets made a series of admissions in a last-minute change of plea ahead of what would have been his trial at Cardiff Crown Court . Miss Mjadzelics also says she warned police about the singer's depraved nature four years ago after he told her he wanted to have sex with a child, but says they refused to investigate it. She was persuaded to give up as Watkins was alerted about her claims and she was threatened with harassment charges. But a year later he was bombarding her with more sick fantasies, revealed he was now addicted to heroin and had raped a five-year-old girl. At that point, she started to gather a file of evidence that eventually led to Watkins' conviction. Miss Mjadzelics claimed besotted female fans of the paedophile are hiding the true . extent of his offending because they secretly offered their children for . abuse. Her claims come as another of Watkins' former lovers, Lostprophets fan Krysta Boyle, reveals he gushed over her tiny frame. Ms Boyle, from Orange County in . California, was 19 years old, 4'11"", and wore child-size clothing when . she met the singer in Hawaii. She told The Sun on Sunday: 'Looking . back, it was obvious something was wrong with him from the moment we . met. But I was a young impressionable fan. 'I remember him commenting a lot on my body and small frame.' She added that he tried to film their sexual encounters and once choked her during sex. Today his ex-bandmates insisted they did not know about the abuse. Speaking for the first time since Watkins' last-minute change of plea on Tuesday ahead of what would have been his trial at Cardiff Crown Court, they released a statement to fans revealing they were 'heartbroken, angry and disgusted'. They said: 'Many of you understandably want to know if we knew what Ian was doing. To be clear: We did not. 'We knew that Ian was a difficult . character. Our personal relationships with him had deteriorated in . recent years to a point that working together was a constant, miserable . challenge. 'But despite his battles with drugs, his egotistic behaviour and the . resulting fractures and frustrations within our band, we never imagined . him capable of behaviour of the type he has now admitted.' The Independent Police Complaints . Commission (IPCC) is investigating claims that South Wales Police failed . to act quickly enough having allegedly been told Watkins was planning . to abuse children as early as 2008. They . have now launched a second investigation over the handling of a . complaint made against Watkins to South Yorkshire Police in 2012. Watkins . was arrested late last year after South Wales Police raided his home on . a drugs tip and stumbled upon hard drives containing images, videos and . conversations about him attacking children. From . early 2010 horrified fans who had become friends with Watkins went . online to beg for help after discovering vile images on his computer. In one post, written before his arrest, a fan wrote: ‘His on-off girlfriend reported him to police twice for being a paedophile. ‘He . sent pornographic pictures of a little girl to a few girls telling them . it was a five-year-old girl he’d raped. He also watches child porn . constantly. Sick sick man.’ Watkins allegedly boasted to obsessed female fans that he had HIV and was on a mission to pass it on to children. Watkins, 38, is due to be sentenced next month after . he admitted to a string of horrific child sex offences including . attempting to rape a fan's 11-month-old baby boy . The comments will only add to the growing . fear that Watkins's guilty pleas offer only a glimpse of the true . extent of his drug-fuelled debauchery. The 36-year-old, from Pontypridd, South . Wales, plotted the shocking abuse with the two mothers of the babies in a . series of text and internet messages. The baby's mother, Woman A, admits aiding and abetting the attempted rapes on her son. She also admits sexually touching the child and taking photographs, before sending them to Watkins. Watkins also admitted conspiring to rape and sexually touch the daughter of the second fan. He admits aiding and abetting Woman B to touch her daughter while he watched on Skype. An . earlier court hearing was told police had 72 pages of conversations . between the pair online talking about their sexual relationship. Woman B mentioned she had a daughter of a young age and Watkins said: 'Bring her along as well.' She said she was getting the child ready for their meeting together - and 'what they all will do together' when they meet up. She . admits sexual assault after touching the child, she also admits taking . an indecent photograph of the child before distributing them. Anyone who has been affected by the Watkins case, or other cases of child abuse, is urged to contact South Wales Police on 029 20634184 or the NSPCC on 0808 800 5000.","Paedophile would have moved on to murder, claims former lover .

"By . Wills Robinson . PUBLISHED: . 06:33 EST, 24 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:36 EST, 25 October 2013 . Night club promoters who released a video of students joking about girls being raped have been condemned by police. The event, called ‘Fresher’s Violation’, was being hosted by the events company TequilaUK at Mezz Club in Leeds, West Yorkshire. The film, which was used to promote the night, featured clips of male clubbers talking about ‘violating’ other students with one suggesting a girl was going to 'get raped'. Shameful: A grab from the promotional video which was made by Tequila to promote their student night out . West Yorkshire police investigated and said the footage was ‘highly inappropriate and sexually suggestive.' A report published by the force said young men were ‘being encouraged to engage in violent sexual acts against females’ and that the video 'encourages violent sex, degrades women and poses a ‘real threat to public safety’. During the clip, a presenter went around the venue, interviewing clubbers and asked: 'How are you going to violate a fresher tonight?' One student replied by saying: 'I’ve got one here with me who’s just disappeared. Anger: Students protested at the video featuring jokes about girls being raped last Thursday night outside Mezz at a demonstration attended by more than 160 people. A petition has gathered more than 3,000 signatures . He then waits for a few seconds before she returns and says 'There she is.' Then the promotional staff member asks: 'And what are you going to do to her tonight?.' The student replies: 'Well she’s paying for the cab, she’s paying for the drinks,' before adding 'She’s going to get raped.' Another said: 'Violate is a very strong word. I’m going to take advantage of someone.' Venue: The controversial night was held at Mezz Bar Leeds which is having its licence reviewed by the city council . The presenter also asks one student: 'How are you going to bring girls back to your little den?' The video was taken down from YouTube and Facebook after receiving negative comments and Tequila UK have since apologised. As a result of the controversy Mezz Club could be stripped of its licence by Leeds City Council, who are reviewing the case. Students took to Tequila UK’s Facebook page to criticse the sickening promotional campaign. One . student wrote: 'What made you think that advocating rape and sexual . assault was ever an okay thing to do, let alone in a poor attempt to . promote your club nights? Defence: The club's managers claim over the last six years the promotion company has been 'responsible' and well behaved . 'This is the definition of rape culture. Disgusted.' Students launched a petition with thousands of signatures in opposition and a late-night protest was staged outside the club. Leeds University Feminist Society have also said they are keen to work on a zero tolerance campaign against sexual assault at venues around the city centre. A spokesperson for Tequila UK posted a statement on Facebook at the time which read: 'This video has been removed whilst we investigate thoroughly. 'We do not normalise, excuse, tolerate or condone rape or sexual abuse of any sort. Tequila has promoted a safe environment for students to enjoy themselves responsibly for the last 21 years. The Tequila video prompted outrage . because it was a particularly extreme example of a culture in which the . trivialisation of rape is seen as 'banter' Emma Friend, Leed's University Union's Equality and Diversity Officer . 'We will continue to maintain our duty of care as we always have done. We apologise for any offence that has been caused.' Police are also looking into free-pouring - where bar staff pour alcohol straight into customers’ mouths from the bottle, which contradicts licencing laws. A statement issued by Mezz said: 'We have taken this matter very seriously. 'Over the last six years that we have worked with Tequila UK, they have proved themselves to be very responsible promoters. 'Their clientele are always polite and well behaved and we have never had any reports of serious offences in relation to the night. 'We are cooperating fully with the licensing authority and we hope to resolve this matter swiftly.' The night was banned in Newcastle two years ago after posters depicting a woman performing a sex act on another man were distributed around houses in the area. Leeds University Union and Leeds . Metropolitan University Union have both voiced their support for the . campaign to stop the event. Emma Friend, Leeds University Union's Equality and Diversity officer, said: 'The Tequila video prompted outrage because it was a particularly extreme example of a culture in which the trivialisation of rape is seen as 'banter'. 'It provoked a reaction from a diversity of students and residents, which was demonstrated at our protest last Thursday night at which over 160 people attended and the petition which gathered over 3000 signatures. 'I think that rape culture and lad banter are not problems that are specific to Leeds but stem from societal attitudes towards sexual consent and objectification which are prevalent everywhere. 'We are now creating a zero tolerance pledge for nightclubs to sign up to, which will mean that they have to introduce zero tolerance to sexual harassment policies and refrain from using sexual objectification in their advertising.' A West Yorkshire Police spokesman said: 'Licensing officers have been made aware and have spoken to the promoters and the venue's management. 'They are continuing to assess the situation.'","Tequila, which runs night at Mezz Club made video to promote event .

Thousands of paedophiles are feared to be evading justice as police refer less than half of all reported child sex abuse cases to prosecutors. Although 18,915 child sexual offences were reported to police last year, just 9,381 went further in the legal system, according to figures unveiled by Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper. The number of reported offences has risen since 2010/11, however the Labour MP revealed there had been a drop in the number of abuse cases passed on to the Crown Prosecution Service, which decides whether to charge alleged offenders. Shadow Home secretary Yvette Cooper, left, branded a drop in the number of child sex offences being referred to prosecutors by police 'appalling', and accused Theresa May, right, of 'hollowing out' the police service . Last year referrals to the CPS fell by 28 per cent compared to 2010/11 figures. Ms Cooper described the reduction as 'appalling', and criticised Home Secretary Theresa May for 'hollowing out' the police service and letting child abuse victims down. Crime prevention minister Norman Baker said he was 'concerned' at the drop in referrals and would be raising the matter with the new Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders. Ms Cooper said the figures were part of a pattern, as referrals for domestic violence, rape and other sexual offences were also going down at a time when reports of the crimes have been rising. Labour's figures, which take in CPS statistics released in a parliamentary answer to the Opposition's Home Affairs team, also showed that in 2012/13, a sexual offence against a child was 24 per cent less likely to be passed to prosecutors. The drop-off in CPS referrals came during a time period when reported child sexual offences rose from 17,730 in 2010/11 to 18,915 last year. Despite this, only 9,381 cases were referred by police to the CPS last year, compared to 13,018 in 2010/11. One possible reason for the rise in . allegations is an increase in the number of historic sex offences . committed following allegations concerning Jimmy Savile coming to light. One possible reason for the rise in allegations is an increase in the number of historic sex offences committed following allegations concerning Jimmy Savile coming to light . Ms Cooper said: 'These figures are extremely shocking and deeply disturbing. 'This is an appalling drop of nearly a third in the number of child abuse cases that the police are referring for prosecution, even though more cases are coming forward. 'It shows the disgraceful way the police have been hollowed out by Theresa May, with so many specialist child protection units also being cut, letting victims down and letting abusers off. 'Children who are victims of sexual . abuse show remarkable courage to come forward and they should have the . confidence that when they report abuse everything possible will be done . to prosecute abusers. These are some of the most devastating crimes of . all which can destroy people's lives. Google chairman Eric Schmidt, pictured above, has announced that internet search results linked to child abuse are to be blocked across the world . 'Instead since 2010 a hollowed out criminal justice system is letting an increasing number of these victims down and that means more dangerous sex offenders are evading justice too. 'These crimes have been swept under the carpet for too long. Yet just as the criminal justice system was starting to get better at investigating and prosecuting, the clock has been turned back.' Mr Baker said that he was leading a national group to ensure all agencies, including the CPS, worked together to identify those at risk of child sexual abuse and that police, health and children's services focused on the needs of the victims. 'Child abuse is a particularly abhorrent crime. The Government has set out measures to prioritise action to prevent abuse happening in the first place, both on and off line,' he said. 'We are also working to target the organised crime groups that perpetrate systematic abuse with the new National Crime Agency bringing specialist skills, resources, stronger tasking arrangements and international reach.' Ms Cooper's revelations come as Google chairman Eric Schmidt announced that internet search results linked to child abuse are to be blocked across the world.The restrictions on depraved videos and images, which have been designed to apply in English-speaking countries, will be expanded to cover the rest of the world and 158 other languages in the next six months.'We've fine-tuned Google Search to prevent links to child sexual abuse material from appearing in our results,' said Mr Schmidt, who added that Google has developed technology that will allow illegal videos to be 'tagged' so that all duplicate copies can be removed across the internet.The move comes following the Daily Mail's Block Online Porn campaign to clean up the internet, and has been welcomed as 'a really significant step forward'by Prime Minister David Cameron.","18,915 child sexual offences reported, but just 9,381 referred to prosecutors .

"By . Glen Owen . PUBLISHED: . 17:54 EST, 30 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:34 EST, 30 November 2013 . Nick Clegg was last night accused of being at the centre of a ‘Coalition cover-up’ over bombshell emails that reveal how he helped to fast-track £12 million of taxpayers’ money to a charity linked to his wife. A watchdog, acting on the advice of a Cabinet Minister, has banned the release of all correspondence relating to the Booktrust case on the grounds that it would have a ‘chilling effect’ on the Government. The ban – condemned by one of the Deputy Prime Minister’s own Liberal Democrat MPs – follows a year-long drive by the Cabinet Office to suppress details of how one of Mr Clegg’s advisers successfully lobbied for Booktrust to receive automatic funding, rather than having to bid against other charities. Nick Clegg (pictured with his wife Miriam) was accused of 'covering up' emails which revealed how he helped to fast track £12million to a charity linked to his wife . The £12 million award came shortly after Miriam Clegg had hosted a lavish reception for the charity – which promotes reading – a fact mentioned by Mr Clegg’s aide Matt Sanders during the lobbying process. It led to angry exchanges within Whitehall after mandarins argued that abandoning procedures to favour the charity was unfair. Now, after a battle by this newspaper to see the emails under Freedom of Information legislation, Information Commissioner Christopher Graham has ruled that they should be kept secret. He said that after reading the ‘candid and frank’ emails he had concluded their disclosure ‘would be likely to prejudice the conduct of Government’. The ban was even condemned by the Deputy Prime Minister's own Liberal Democrat MPs . In his ruling, Mr Graham, advised by Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude, admitted there was ‘a public interest in the processes that lead to such decisions being transparent’ because the funding decision ‘may have an effect on the educational opportunities for children’. Significantly, he added: ‘The public interest in ensuring such transparency  in this case is increased given the specific circumstances of this case which the [Mail on Sunday] has highlighted .  .  . there is genuine public interest in the disclosure of information which would inform the public as to whether or not there has been any impropriety in the awarding of these funds.’ But he decided this was overridden by the need for Ministers to be ‘able to inform themselves about how the implementation of Government policy might affect the Government as a whole’, adding that this ‘was particularly important for the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister who must have an overview of the Government’s activities’. He concluded: ‘The withheld information contains candid and frank exchanges that were clearly conducted with the expectation that they would be treated confidentially.’ This led him to conclude: ‘Disclosure of the withheld information would have been likely to result in a chilling effect and thus potentially inhibit the contributions of individuals when providing advice to other departments.’ Last night, Lib Dem MP John Hemming said: ‘Where public money is involved I think there should be a clear audit trail, and I am surprised that they did not release, at the very least, a few redacted emails. ‘They seem to have taken a Trappist vow of silence. We should know how decisions such as these are made now, not have to wait 30 years for the release of Government papers.’ Labour MP John Mann said: ‘This looks a lot like a Coalition cover-up – Mr Maude protecting his new friends in the Lib Dems. If they had wanted to disprove any allegations of impropriety, they could have released a section of the emails to rebut that charge without jeopardising either officials’ identities or the confidentiality of Government business.’ Mr Clegg’s office maintains that the decision on Booktrust’s funding was taken ‘in an entirely proper way by the Secretary of State for Education’. There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by Booktrust. A Cabinet Office spokesman  said: ‘There is no question of any undue influence or pressure being brought to bear by the Deputy  Prime Minister.’","Deputy Prime Minister helped push through multi-million grant to Booktrust .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 11:19 EST, 12 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:13 EST, 12 November 2013 . 'Holy warrior': Basit Javed Sheikh, 29, of Cary, N.C., is charged in a federal criminal indictment with attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization . A North Carolina man is facing federal charges that he tried to join an al-Qaida-linked militant group fighting the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad. Basit Javed Sheikh, 29, of Cary, is charged in a federal criminal indictment with attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. He was arrested November 2 before boarding the first of a series of flights that would take him to Lebanon and then on to Syria. Sheikh told an FBI informant he was going to join the group called the al-Nusrah Front in Syria, an FBI agent said in a sworn affidavit released this week. The Pakistan native was assigned two federal public defenders to represent him during a court hearing last week. For five months this year, Sheikh, also known as Abdul Basit, posted messages and pro-militant propaganda videos on at least two Facebook accounts expressing support for jihadi forces fighting Assad’s forces in the bloody, 3-year-old Syrian civil war. The ongoing conflict so far has killed more than 100,000 people, said the affidavit signed by FBI Special Agent Jason Maslow. The 29-year-old’s social media pages featured photos of machine guns, pictures of wounded American soldiers, and even an image of the U.S. Capitol building being destroyed by a massive wave. Radicalized: Sheikh told an FBI informant he was going to join the group called the al-Nusrah Front (not pictured) in Syria to fight against the forces of President Assad . In August, Sheikh began an online relationship with an FBI undercover employee on a Facebook page promoting Islamic extremism, the affidavit said. The 29-year-old man allegedly said that he had secured a job 'with a brigade in logistics, managing medical supplies.' Sheikh told the informant in early September that he'd bought a one-way ticket to travel to Turkey in hopes of making contact with people who would get him to Syria. Sheikh said he backed out because ‘he could not muster the strength to leave his parents,’ the affidavit said. Sheikh said he had traveled to Turkey last year hoping to join the fight in Syria, but became dispirited by his experience with people who claimed to be part of the U.S.-backed Free Syrian Army, and who, according to Sheikh, were motivated by financial gain. But according to the documents, Sheikh's desire to join the holy war was unshakable, and he told the covert FBI agent that 'he would not feel good about himself and would continue to feel like a hypocrite until he went on jihad.' He was determined to be a martyr for the cause, he allegedly told the informant. Disillusioned: Sheikh had traveled to Turkey last year hoping to join the fight in Syria, but became dispirited by his experience with people who claimed to be part of the U.S.-backed Free Syrian Army . In late September, the mole put Sheikh in touch with 'a trusted brother' from the militant group Jabhat al-Nusra, who later turned out to be an FBI undercover agent. Jabhat al-Nusra is also known as the Nusra Front - a cell of al-Qaida in Iraq which was designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S. Department of State in 2002. The Carey man is a legal permanent U.S. resident hailing from Pakistan. Between 1992 and 2000, he lived in the island Republic of Seychelles in the Indian Ocean. Sheikh was described in the affidavit as a post office worker, but the U.S. Postal Service said in a statement that the 29-year-old was not employed by the agency. His arrest came November 2 when he arrived at Raleigh Durham International Airport to board a flight to Turkey and Lebanon via Canada. Nabbed: Sheikh was arrest while trying to board a flight to Canada from Raleigh Durham Airport . Sheikh checked in a bag and walked through the security checkpoint, at which point he was surrounded by law enforcement officials and taken away from questioning. Prior to his arrest, the FBI informant offered Sheikh a chance to back out, telling him that 'fighting is not for everyone,' but the 29-year-old man plowed ahead with the plot. ‘I want to help in any way I can,’ Sheikh wrote, according to the affidavit, adding: ‘I'm serious [brother]. ... I'm not scared. ... I'm [sic] have though it out. ... I'm ready.’ He is being held without bond at Wake County Jail. If convicted, Sheikh could be sentenced to up to 15 years in prison and fined $250,000. Four years ago, eight Raleigh-area Muslims were arrested on charges they were behind a homegrown terror plot to attack the U.S. Marine Corps base at Quantico, Va., and perceived overseas enemies of Islam. Seven either pleaded guilty to terrorism-related charges or were convicted at trial. The last, Jude Kenan Mohammad, was among four Americans confirmed as being killed by drones in either Pakistan or Yeman since 2009, the Obama administration said in May.","Basit Javed Sheikh, 29, also known as Abdul Basit, is Pakistani native and U.S. permanent resident .

This satellite view shows the area of Political Prison Camp 15 in Yodok, North Korea, where 150,000 inmates are allegedly kept . More than 150,000 North Koreans remain incarcerated in a Soviet-style, hidden 'gulag' despite the communist government's denial it holds political prisoners. The shocking claim is made in a report released today by the U.S.-based Committee for Human Rights in North Korea, and is based on interviews with 60 former prisoners and guards. It includes satellite images of what are described as prison labor camps and penitentiaries. The report documents the alleged incarceration of whole families, including children and grandparents for the 'political crimes' of other family members. It also documents infanticide and the forced abortions of women prisoners, who illegally crossed into China and got pregnant by men, and were then forcibly repatriated to North Korea. The committee, a private group, is holding a conference Tuesday in Washington, timed for Pyongyang's celebrations to mark the centennial of the repressive nation's founder. U.S. envoy on North Korean human rights, Robert King, is due to address the conference. The conference comes as the international spotlight shines on the North over its plans to launch a long-range rocket and, according to South Korean intelligence, a third nuclear test. 'It is not just nuclear weapons that have to be dismantled,' said Roberta Cohen, chair of the committee's board of directors, 'but an entire system of political repression.' The report says the camp system was initially modeled in the 1950s on the Soviet gulag, to punish 'wrong thinkers' and those belonging to the 'wrong political class' or religious persuasion. It cites estimates from North Korean state security agency officials who defected to South Korea that the camp system holds between 150,000 and 200,000 people - out of a total population of around 24 million. It urges North Korea to allow the International Committee of the Red Cross access, and to dismantle the camps. Amnesty International raised awareness of the issue last year, asking North Korea to ensure basic humanitarian treatment and due process at the camp . In this Amnesty video, workers point out where prisoners are incarcerated . The camp, in North Korea, is very large and contains an estimated 150,000-200,00 inmates . The UN hopes that North Korea, ran by Kim Jong-Un, will release his people from their torment . The 200-page report described different kinds of detention facilities, including penal labor colonies where it says political detainees are imprisoned without judicial process for mostly lifetime sentences in mining, logging or agricultural enterprises. The labor colonies are enclosed behind barbed wires and electrified fences, mainly in the north and north central mountains of the country, the report says, alleging high rates of death in detention due to systemic mistreatment, torture, execution and malnutrition. The report alleged provides precise geographical locations of the political prison camps. It says former prisoners were able to identify their former barrack and houses, work sites, execution grounds and other landmarks in the camps via imagery available through Google Earth. The committee says the report's findings contradict a December 2009 statement by North Korea to the United Nations Human Rights Council that the political prisoner camps do not exist. Greg Scarlatoiu, the committee's executive director, said that more than 30,000 North Korean defectors have now fled the country - up from just 3,000 a decade ago - so Pyonngyang cannot hide the harsh reality of its political prison camps.","U.S. alleges the camp holds political dissidents of 'political repression'

'We both started online dating to open it up again, and to practice dating - it's always quantity over quality when you start, which eventually leads to meeting people in the real world again.' After going on a dozen or so dates with men she met online, Miss Stollak took a chance on a guy who gave her his number at a club. The book, released October 15, reveals just how Granny Gail became so wise in love, revealing her romantic back story . 'Normally I would say no, but I was . going on so many dates anyway,' she said. The date was a success and a . relationship blossomed that lasted two years. 'We just broke broke up . after the book got printed, it was a great relationshiop that ran it's . course.' Meanwhile Granny, as Miss Stollak calls her, wasn't looking for a relationship . - she was simply looking to have some fun, and support her . granddaughter. 'Shes likes her independence, not being committed to . someone,' said Miss Stollak. So the pair set off on a dating adventure that proved to be both good practice, and fodder for entertainment. 'Granny has got one setting: real,' Miss Stollak, who works as a TV writer, told Today. 'Friends will sugarcoat things, make it sounds nice. But Granny's like, ""Here's how it is. Listen, I know, I've been there.""' The book, released October 15, reveals just how West Palm Beach resident Granny Gail became so wise in love, giving her romantic back story that Miss Stollak never touched on in the blog. 'We wanted to tell that story,' she said. According to the book, Gail dated her ex-husband for just five . weeks before tying the knot at 19 in 1954. Six weeks later she was . pregnant, and two years after that her husband admitted cheating on her. When a co-worker of her husband's caught her eye at one of their regular dinner parties, the book explains how she began a love affair that spanned the rest of her marriage and then through her . divorce in her early forties. As the young New Yorker found herself single after the end of a four-year relationship, the pair decided to tackle the online dating together -- using the blog Granny Is My Wingman to keep track of their escapades . Having never moved on from her love affair, she decided to delve into online dating with her granddaughter for support and as a personal challenge. 'We were always close, but I didn’t know as many details about her past,' Miss Stollak told the New York Daily News. Gail . said she thought Miss Stollak was old enough to hear the truth and . finally opened up to her granddaughter about her past. 'I thought she’d . understand better,' she said, adding that dating online was something . she was ready for. But after several failed romantic affairs, Gail has now decided to stick to dating people in . her building or men her friends fix her up with. Some of them are . widowers. 'I’ll say, ""Well, . how long is his wife gone?""' she said. 'If it’s not close to at least a . year, I don’t want to bother with them. Let them go through their . mourning.' 'Granny has got one setting: real,' said Miss Stollak, who works as a TV writer. 'Friends will sugarcoat things, make it sounds nice. But Granny's like, ""Here's how it is. Listen, I know, I've been there""' As for Miss Stollak, she recalls the 'serial dater' who kept his phone crammed with numbers of girls he met on OkCupid, the . man so shy he hardly said a word, and the self-professed 'globetrotter' who insulted her job at the time -- a cocktail waitress. After being stood up for the first time, Miss Stollick recalls: 'Granny offered up a gem in condolence, ""Better he stands . ya up now, than at the alter."" So true, so true.' Coming out of a long-term relationship, Miss Stollak said she wanted to move on from her ex-boyfriend but also felt she needed 'practice dating.' 'What do you say on a first date? Where do you go? How do you act?' she asked -- questions she touches on for both generations in the book. '""Just go out and have fun, Kayli!"" That was what I kept telling her,' said Gail, adding that 'in the process of me trying to convince her, she said, ""Okay, but you do it too."" 'So I would do it on my level, she would do it on her level. And we’d talk about it.'","After Kayli Stollak found herself single in New York at the end of a four-year relationship, she turned to her 75-year-old grandmother, Gail, for help .

Yet more doubts have been raised over the authenticity of 'reality television' show Breaking Amish after one character revealed she has been divorced, which is rarely allowed in the Amish community. Cast member Rebecca accepts a proposal from Abe on the TLC show, which depicts the two meeting in New York for the 'first time' - yet they are believed to already have a child together in real life. It has now been claimed that, despite the 'revelation' on the show, Rebecca left her first husband, Rufus Hostetler, to start a relationship with Abe in 2010. The claims spark yet more trouble for Breaking Amish, which has repeatedly come under fire for deceiving viewers since its launch more than a month ago. TLC says the show follows five Amish and Mennonite men and women as they leave their communities for the first time and head to New York City - yet this story has slowly crumbled. Scroll down for video . 'Honesty': Breaking Amish cast member Rebecca, right, tells her fiance Abe, left, that she is divorced . Secret: But in reality, the couple are believed to have been together for two years and have a child . While each cast member claims to have . grown up in the strict communities, evidence has surfaced suggesting . they have decidedly dark pasts - involving divorce, arrests, children . and domestic abuse. It . comes in stark contrast to the naive characters portrayed on the show, . who stare slack-jawed at Manhattan's towering buildings and pray as they . travel by plane 'for the first time'. Among the characters, Rebecca and . Abe are portrayed as meeting for the first time on the show - with a . possible love match on the cards. But, after the show depicts the pair . getting closer and Abe proposing to Rebecca, she reveals she has been . divorced - to his apparent shock. 'False claims': On the show, Rebecca and Abe, pictured, claim they have never met before . 'Falling in love': Rebecca had actually left her husband for Abe shortly after her marriage in March 2010 . 'I have to make a decision between you and, like, being Amish,' he says on the show. But a photograph uploaded to a Facebook page,  Breaking Amish the Truth, apparently shows that the pair in fact already have a child together. Reports and . marriage records reveal that Rebecca married Rufus Hostetler in March . 2010 before divorcing him this past summer, although their relationship . apparently broke down much earlier. In . a message on Hostetler's Facebook wall in October 2010, he writes: 'I . am tryn 2 figure out why in th world abe schmucker wud want to b a . friend on face book afterall he left wht my wife.' And . while Abe claims in the program that he has never partied, police . records - and a mug shot - reveal he was arrested for alcohol . intoxication in a public place in 2008, when he was just 18. Old life: Blog reports identified her ex-husband as Rufus Hostetler, pictured with his new girlfriend . In perhaps the most shocking revelation about the real lives of the characters, Jeremiah, another cast member, is divorced from a woman who claims he repeatedly beat her. Brush with the law: A mug shot of Abe from 2008 after he was arrested for being drunk in public . Public records reveal that 32-year-old Jeremiah Raber, who regularly swears on the show, has three children -  two daughters, aged seven and three, and a son, five. The children live with their mother, Naomi Stutzman, . in Ohio. The couple married in 2005 and she filed for divorce in 2011, . citing gross neglect of duty, extreme cruelty and incompatibility. Speaking to CBS21, Stutzman, who has also left the Amish community, called the show 'a fake' and lambasted TLC for perpetuating lies on a family channel about a man accused of repeatedly attacking his wife. 'The kids and I suffered for years at the hands of this man,' she said. 'My family is livid because they took . him in and cared for him, now he is doing this? I'm not surprised at . him. What surprised me was TLC. My kids and I watch TLC. They are . supposed to be a family channel. For them to do this is appalling.' Police reports showed she called authorities on at least eight occasions and Jeremiah was arrested for domestic violence in 2005. She said that his violence eventually led to their break up. 'Reality' TV? TLC's show Breaking Amish has come under fire for its false claims about its characters' pasts . On one occasion, he punched her in . the stomach while she was pregnant, a police report notes. She said that . TLC offered her $10,00 to stay quiet on the incidents, which TLC . denies. She added that, . while Jeremiah is shown getting a large arm tattoo in Breaking Amish, . he has in fact had it for years - and it bears the names of his three . children. Jeremiah was also reportedly away from his Amish community for up to 14 years and is pictured on social networking sites surrounded by beer cans. Daniel Gingerich, who claims he lived with Jeremiah for a year and a half, added: 'I've known him for years. I let him move in because he was living out of his truck and had no place else to go.' And the other cast members apparently were holding back some information, too. On the show: Jeremiah says he is desperate to break away from his Amish community on the show - but has reportedly already spent 14 years away . Past: Photographs from an old MySpace page show Jeremiah looking decidedly un-Amish . TLC has previously admitted that . Kate, who is billed as an Amish bishop's daughter and aspiring model, . has been arrested for a DUI, but now new information paints an even more . rebellious picture. As revealed on a Facebook page,, she . has previously submitted images to modeling agencies - which is at odds . with the Amish stance against photographs, believing they represent . 'vanity' which they deem a sin. Online records show that Kate posted a photograph on exploretalent.com to enter a Best Smile contest in 2010 - years before she claimed she gave up her Amish life to move to the city. This internet savvy version of Kate is a far cry from an episode of Breaking Amish in which she is overwhelmed by new technology and struggles to work an elevator. Revealed: Jeremiah's wife, Naomi Stutzman, spoke to CBS21 about how Jeremiah repeatedly attacked her . Wild: Pictures also show Jeremiah, left, surrounded by friends swigging from beer cans . The final character, Sabrina, a 25-year-old . from an Italian and Puerto Rico family who was adopted into the faith, . is pictured on Facebook kissing a man while she wears skimpy clothing. She . was reportedly married in 2009 and has not been a practicing Mennonite . for years, friends claim, suggesting this is not the 'first time' she . has left the community. She is pictured on her wedding day in a ceremony that is not traditionally Mennonite. The apparent betrayal by the creators of Breaking Amish is documented on a Facebook page, Breaking Amish the Truth, on which people who claim to know the cast have vented their anger. Scores of people have also uploaded photographs showing the cast in their 'real' lives. Mose Gingerich, a former Amish who appeared on a separate show, Amish in the City, lambasted the show for its dishonesty. Dark pasts: TLC had previously admitted that Kate, pictured left on the show, was arrested for DUI, right . Aspiring model: A photo of Kate has been found online from a smiling contest in 2010 . 'This . show is doing exactly opposite of what I stand for,' he wrote on his . blog. 'The fakeness of these characters supposedly just leaving the . community, when in fact, they have been out for many years. 'The . fact that they act like things like microwaves and iPhones are . something strange, when indeed, they have owned them for years . themselves, and the disrespect they show towards the Amish. 'I would never stoop to doing a show like this, and really wish no one else would have done it either.' In response to the outrage, TLC has said it will address the revelations in time. 'There is a lot of information . floating around about the group featured on Breaking Amish. Much of it . is not true, but some of it is - and is addressed in upcoming episodes,' TLC told Variety. Half truths: Sabrina, a Mennonite, was reportedly married in 2009 - which is not mentioned on the show . Double life: But Facebook photos apparently show her kissing a man and wearing skimpy clothes . Keeping it quiet: An acquaintance of Sabrina's uploaded this picture of her on her wedding day . 'Our Amish and Mennonite producers that we hired introduced us to . Amish and Mennonite men and women who were already determined to leave. They had already made the decision to go out and see . the world, with or without us. They courageously allowed us to follow . them on this journey.' Despite these protestations, TLC has adjusted the description of the show on its website. It was previously billed as 'four . Amish and one Mennonite, breaking away from their faith and traveling to . New York City for the first time'. Now the TLC site explains: 'Breaking Amish offers an unprecedented look into a rarely seen world, following four Amish people and one Mennonite as they forgo horses and buggies for New York City's taxis and subways' - taking out any reference to 'first time' in New York City.

The Guinness Book of World Records last week declared it the world’s largest entirely edible gingerbread exhibit. It is currently on display at the New York Hall of Science in Queens. All of the pieces were made by Lovitch, usually late at night after returning from his work as the executive sous chef at the New York Marriott at the Brooklyn Bridge. ‘My wife likes the fact that I work on it at home and I’m not out gambling or drinking,’ Lovitch told the New York Times.

Tony Blair's daughter Kathryn (pictured at her brother's wedding) was threatened at gunpoint as she walked with her boyfriend . Tony Blair’s daughter Kathryn has been threatened at gunpoint in a botched robbery. The young barrister was walking her dog with her boyfriend and a group of friends when the attackers struck. The pair were in Marylebone, a mile from the £975,000 home her father bought her in 2010, and near his own central London property. One attacker was said to be wearing a balaclava while the other had his face obscured by a dark scarf. Neither 25-year-old Miss Blair nor her boyfriend were harmed in the attack, which took place at around 8pm on Monday. The attempted mugging is thought to be linked to another similar incident in the area on the same night. The two attempted robberies took place just half an hour apart and both involved the use of a firearm to threaten a couple. A spokesman for the Blairs said:  ‘Kathryn was with a group of friends. No one was hurt and nothing was stolen.’ The group were approached by two men, one armed with a gun, and were asked for cash and jewellery before the suspects fled empty-handed. Metropolitan Police officers from the Westminster borough are investigating but no arrests have been made. The attack raises concerns for the safety of the Blairs, who could be  targeted due to the former prime  minister’s role as peace envoy to the Middle East, and to his decision to go to war in Iraq in 2003. One security expert said last night: ‘It seems staggering that the daughter of a man who evokes such extreme emotions in some should be wandering around in the dark at night without protection. ‘To think she had a gun pulled on her and was effectively defenceless raises massive questions about her personal safety. Thankfully she came to no harm but the potential terrorism threat is obvious.’ A neighbour of Miss Blair said . yesterday: ‘She must have been absolutely terrified. I can’t imagine . what must have gone through her mind when she saw a man pull out a gun. My first thought would have been terrorist. Property: The pair were in Marylebone, a mile from the £975,000 home her father bought her in 2010, and near his own central London property (pictured) ‘She’s a lovely girl and we are just relieved she is OK. Part of her charm is that she is so down to earth. ‘You would hardly believe her connections unless you knew her as she appears to live such a normal life but this highlights the danger of not living amid all that security.’ Another local said she would now be wary of walking the streets in the area after dark. Dog walker Marion Rowland, 68, said: 'It is frightening to know that happened. It's very peaceful around here and I am going to take more care in future. 'I walk the dog at around 10pm, but I might have to rethink doing that.' One elderly resident, who did not want to be named, said she was 'living in fear'. She . added: 'How terrifying for that poor girl - she must have been so . scared when she saw the gun. Some people will do anything for money, I . guess. 'Me and my husband don't go out late at night so we didn't see anything, but it's terrifying to hear about it. 'I won't walk down Boston Place and there's an estate at the top of the road, so I won't leave the house when it's dark. 'I'm living in fear anyway, but it's scary to know people are carrying guns around here. 'I tried to get a strong gate for my front door a few years ago, but the council said they didn't want 'fortress London' outside our house. 'I'll definitely be taking even more care in the future.' Police have responded by putting extra patrols in the surrounding area as their investigations are carried out. He showed her a gun, but she managed to run away and nothing was taken. Detective Inspector Chris Rhodes, from Westminster's Robbery and Burglary Squad, said: 'Fortunately none of the victims were injured and nothing was stolen. 'However, being confronted by an armed man is deeply distressing. 'We are appealing for the public's help to try and track down the man responsible and his accomplice. 'If you were out and about around this area on Monday night and saw something then please get in touch. 'Detectives are in the process of tracking down CCTV from the surrounding area and our investigation is ongoing. 'Extra patrols will be taking place in and around the area over the coming days.' A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: ‘We were alerted at around 8.30pm to two attempted robberies in the street in the Marylebone area. 'The first happened at 8pm and was carried out by a lone suspect. The second occurred approximately 30 minutes later. ‘We believe both attempted robberies were carried out by the same male suspect though on the second occasion he was accompanied by another individual.

There have been no arrests at this stage. ‘We would urge anyone with information to contact us immediately.’ Miss Blair, who was educated in  Islington, was pictured days before the attack at the wedding of her 29-year-old brother Euan to Suzanne Ashman in  Buckinghamshire. She was called to the Bar last year by Lincoln’s Inn – the same inn of court her parents Tony and Cherie joined in the 1970s.","Kathryn Blair was walking her dog with her boyfriend close to home .

The social network announced Tuesday that it will begin rolling out its own version of the boorish video ads this week to a small number of users who might not mind them as much as they think. The launch comes only one day after a report suggesting such ads were imminent as Facebook looks to make inroads into the upwards of $66billion spent on television advertising this year. Scroll down for video . They're coming!: The autoplay ads as they appear on a mobile device . Facebook has taken a number of steps to try to mitigate the certain backlash from users, but not everyone seems to agree the site has done enough to make them less-intrusive than if they did not play automatically. They will play the second they appear on a user’s screen, but will have no sound unless tapped or clicked on – solving one of the major complaints more internet surfers have about auto-play ads. The ads also will not autoplay on mobile devices unless they are connected to WiFi, which will limit the hit people take to their data plans. The catch to the ads not playing unless mobile devices are connected to WiFi is that the Facebook app will download them – which will eat further into precious storage space already consumed by music, photos and apps. Once the video ad is finished playing, a carousel giving people the option of viewing more video ads will appear. The first advertiser taking advantage of the new platform is Lions Gate Entertainment – with an ad for the film ‘Divergent’ that was made specifically for Facebook. These features don’t appear to be set in stone, as Facebook said the ads are open for further tweaking during this ‘intial, limited test.’ ‘We’ll continue to refine this new way for brands to tell stories on Facebook to ensure the best experience for people and marketers.’ More choices: A carousel with three more ads appears after the initial ad finishes playing . Despite the rollout not yet being site-wide, the backlash has already begun. ‘This feature does NOT improve my experience on Facebook, and actually it makes my experience worse than before,’ wrote one user. ‘Please provide a way to TURN OFF auto-play for those of us who do not want it!’ Another person pleaded. The announcement came only one day after the Wall Street Journal reported the ads’ launch would happen later this week. The Journal originally reported over the summer the ads were imminent, Facebook delayed the launch ‘fearing ads could annoy users.’ Facebook’s foray into autoplay video ads comes only one month after Instagram – which is owned by Facebook – launched video ads of its own.","The ads are currently in a limited beta .

Fresh sea bass from your local fishmonger, organic vegetables from the grocers and artisan bread from the village bakery is a foodie’s dream - but who has the time or energy to shop for that? One new delivery service, which allows users to order food online from a range of local shops and have them delivered to their door in one lot, is hoping to make that concept a reality. Hubbub - an Ocado-style delivery service for local shops - describes itself as a home delivery service on a mission to save the high-street. So how does it work? Customers log in to their website and fill up their online basket with goods from participating shops in their local area and Hubbub drivers will collect your order from each shop and deliver it to your door at your chosen time. Scroll down for video . That's handy! Hubbub is an Ocado-style delivery service for local shops that allows customers to buy food online and have it delivered to their door . The service costs £3.50 - the first order and any orders over £75 are, however, free. Marisa Leaf, a former human rights lawyer, is the brains behind the business. She came up with the idea in 2007 after working such long hours that she was forced to live off convenience food. She loved to eat well and had always been passionate about independent shops - but her lifestyle meant that, when it came to where she shopped and what she ate, she couldn’t make the choices she wanted to. So in 2008, she spent £30,000 of her own money to pilot the concept. Speaking to The Telegraph, she said: 'I kept thinking, if you could have the convenience of an online supermarket but with the quality and integrity of local shops, that would be perfect.’ Easy peasy: Shoppers log on, shop and then choose a delivery time suited to them, with the service costing £3.50 . Hubbub was officially born in January 2010 and currently delivers 4,000 products from 32 independent shops across 200 postcodes of London. Local shops such as Spice Mountain in Borough Market, Moxon’s fishmongers in south London and Giacobazzi's delicatessen in Hampstead are some of the businesses on board. Hubbub promises that its items cost the same as they would in store and Leaf charges retailers around 50 per cent of their profit on the goods. ‘Today, Hubbub is a team of 13 food-loving shop-supporting superheroes including two former chefs, a food anthropologist, a development economist, an engineer, a wannabe pop-up restaurateur, two developers with massive brains, and our dashing delivery drivers,’ writes Leaf on her website. Speaking about her customers, Leaf said they have a higher-than-average income, 'because by definition they are cash-rich and time-poor.’ ‘I don’t agree with the common assumption that high street shops cost more than the supermarket. If you stand outside the Ginger Pig [a renowned London butcher] you will see people from all walks of life, because butchers sell cuts of meat that you don’t get in supermarkets,’ she said. And Leaf is thinking big: she plans to take her foodie brainchild nationwide.

Bad behavior: Former Morgan Stanley wealth manager John Kelly faces up to four years in prison if convicted of unlawful surveillance . A former Morgan Stanley executive's defense in a criminal case accusing him of secretly taping sex acts with three women has gone to the dogs. According to court documents made public Thursday, the once high-powered wealth manager John C. Kelly told investigators last February that he had set up cameras in his Manhattan apartment to keep an eye on his pooch, but the device accidentally caught his sexual escapades. 'It’s on and sometimes stays on. So I accidentally recorded myself having sex because it’s always recording,' Kelly told police February 26, 2013. Mr Kelly, the son of a prominent New York City lawyer, pleaded not guilty today in Manhattan Supreme Court to 19 counts of unlawful surveillance and attempted unlawful surveillance. The financier’s attorney, Benjamin Brafman, suggested that one of his client’s paramours had pressed charges against Kelly as payback for getting her arrested for vandalizing his home. According to attorney Daniel Parker, who represents one of the women at the center of the case, the X-rated recordings were not made by accident since Kelly used a sophisticated surveillance system featuring a hidden camera, a webcam and a phone application to record his victims in his apartment and in their own homes, New York Post reported. Parker added that Kelly even concealed a recording device in a bookshelf inside his East 69th Street apartment, and then shared the pornographic videos on YouTube and Vimeo. Canine scapegoat: Kelly told investigators he . had set up cameras to monitor his pooch (right) while he was at work, but . the devices ended up recording his sexcapades . Accused pervert: John Kelly has worked for Morgan Stanley for nearly a decade . Officials said Kelly shot videos of . his amorous activities with three different partners between September . 2011 and December 2012. Revelations of the conduct drove one woman to . trash his apartment. The women were in his apartment at separate times, the New York Daily News reported. ‘In this case, the defendant videotaped three unrelated women while they were performing sexual acts on him in his home,’ said prosecutor Siobhan Carthy during the financier’s arraignment in November, the paper reported. Victims ‘did not consent to such images being recorded and defendant did not have permission or authority to record or possess such images,’ the criminal complaint stated. The breasts, buttocks and vagina of one of the victims could be clearly seen in the video, officials said. In the doghouse: While Kelly has insisted that the surveillance was accidental, an attorney representing one of the victims claimed that the financier had a complex video recording system in place suggesting that he intended to tape his sex romps . Fall from grace: Kelly, the son of a prominent attorney, was fired from Morgan Stanley the same day he was arrested . One of the women who found out about the secret recordings broke into Mr Kelly’s apartment, according to the Daily News. She trashed the place, poured soda onto his computer and was charged with burglary, but that case should be dismissed, the paper noted. Kelly was arrested in connection to the sex tapes November 8, 2013 - on the same day that he was fired from his job for allegedly writing bad checks. His father, john Q. Kelly, once represented former New York Yankee player Joe Pepitone and the estate of Nicole Brown Simpson - the slain wife of O.J. Simpson. John C. Kelly is due back in court April 10. He could face up to four years in prison if convicted of the charges against him.","John Kelly has been accused of secretly filming sexual encounters with three women .

Russian writer Leo Tolstoy famously once said 'music is the shorthand of emotion', and with this in mind a New York artist has created a musical composition using just her brain waves. Called Euonia, which is Greek for ‘beautiful thought’, Lisa Park was able to translate how her brain reacted to feelings of sadness, anger and desire directly into musical notes. By training her brain to control these emotions, Park was then able to perform her musical score simply by thinking about it. Scroll down for video .

The artist trained for a month by thinking of people and situations that made her feel these different emotions. The movement of the water gave a visual representation of the speed, volume and pitch of the sound, and as brain activity and emotional intensity changed, so did the movement of the droplets. The aim of her work is ‘to use technology to engage and evoke human emotion rather than alienation and create art that empowers the public through awareness of them.’ For the Euonia project, Park told Slate magazine the goal of the piece was 'to exercise control over her own mind, to make her mind so still and so calm that there’s nothing for the EEG sensor to read.' Park was hoping that by calming her thoughts she could silence the speakers, and stop the water from moving. She admitted that this was achievable when she was on her own, but performing made her nervous, which affected her inner calm. She has previously used heart rate sensors to track how different emotions affect her body.

"By . Leon Watson . UPDATED: . 07:27 EST, 25 May 2012 . Islamists are widely expected to win a majority in Egypt's new parliament after threatening a crackdown on alcohol and bikinis. The popularity of the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party has left Egypts tourist industry fearing they will be elected when the parliament reconvenes next month. The Brotherhood has said tourists can do without alcohol while ultra-conservative Salafist candidates have taken it a step further by demanding a ban on all alcohol sales. Egypt's planned crackdown on booze and bikinis could hamper the tourism industry. Picture: The Sphinx and Pyramids of Giza in Cairo . They've also called for segregating Egypt's beaches by sex and banning revealing swimwear. Political unrest and violence have kept tourists away from this and other Egyptian landmarks since the fall of former president, Hosni Mubarak. Officials say the number of visitors this holiday season is down by more than one-third compared to the same time last year. Hisham Zaazou, the senior assistant tourism minister, said: 'These are irresponsible statements in my opinion that, even if said by responsible people, I believe they do not understand the set-up of the industry and the dynamics of it.' 'Four out of five tourists who come to Egypt do so for leisure vacations at the beach rather than to visit the pyramids or other historical sites. 'More than three-quarters of all visitors to Egypt are from Europe,' he says. 'They expect to be able to enjoy the beach as they would at home. Politicians have called for segregating Egypt's beaches by sex and banning revealing swimwear . 'To swim, you wear a bathing costume. To have dinner, part of the culture is to have a drink with the dinner. 'This is the kind of information people have to understand that do not understand the industry. And you don't change the culture of people,' Mr Zaazou said. But Azza al-Jarf, the Islamist lawmaker, says Egyptian officials need to rethink their approach to tourism. She argues that appealing to Muslim visitors abroad and domestically will boost tourism, as would hosting more international conferences. She adds that separating beaches by sex and curbing public consumption of alcohol won't affect these new markets or even the old ones. Such pronouncements are naive, says Elhamy el-Zayat, who chairs the Egyptian Tourism Federation and runs a company specialising in conference tourism. He says he's talked with the Muslim Brotherhood and the Salafists at length about their tourism proposals and why they won't work. He believes that once the Islamists are in power and faced with the financial reality, they'll stop trying to make Egyptian tourists conform to a more conservative Islamic lifestyle. 'If they were not pragmatic, could they have collected so many votes?' Mr el-Zayat said. 'They were very pragmatic and very sly, we have to remember this.'","Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party says tourists can do without alcohol .

Pollution makes thunderstorms worse by creating bigger, longer lasting clouds and cooling temperatures with their shadows, say scientists. Computer simulations of cloud data from the western Pacific, south eastern China and Oklahoma showed pollution increased their size, thickness and duration. Taking a closer look at the properties of water droplets and ice crystals within, the researchers found pollution resulted in smaller droplets and ice crystals regardless of location. Billow talk: pollution increases clouds' size, thickness and duration, say experts . In clean skies ice particles were heavier and fell faster causing the clouds to dissipate. But in polluted skies they were smaller and too light to drop leading to the larger clouds. Dr Jiwen Fan, of Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Washington, said: ‘This study reconciles what we see in real life to what computer models show us. ‘Observations consistently show taller and bigger anvil-shaped clouds in storm systems with pollution.’ A polluted sky has many more aerosols - natural and manmade particles - making more but smaller cloud droplets. Lingering: The study found that pollution makes afternoon thunderstorms last further into the night . Researchers have long believed smaller droplets start a chain reaction that leads to bigger, longer-lasting clouds. Instead of raining down, the lighter droplets carry their water higher, where they freeze. The freezing squeezes out the heat the droplets carry with them and causes the thunder cloud to become draftier. Dr Fan said: ‘Modelling the details of cloud microphysical properties is very computationally intensive so models don't usually include them.’ Polluted clouds have an effect on temperatures, with afternoon thunderstorms lasting long into the night rather than dissipating and trapping heat like a blanket. In the day the clouds’ shadows diminish sunlight penetration and so keep the Earth cooler. Accounting for pollution effects on storm clouds could affect the ultimate amount of warming predicted for the earth in the next few decades. Accurately representing clouds in climate models is key to improving the accuracy of predicted changes to the climate.","Pollution causes taller and bigger anvil-shaped clouds, say experts .

Georgia Regents University is drawing criticism from animal rights activists who claim the school is euthanizing dogs in 'unnecessary' dental experiments. The Humane Society posted a video last week, taken as part of a three-month undercover investigation, which shows dogs having their teeth pulled, replaced with implants and then euthanized to test bone samples. Two days after the video was released, activists organized a protest on the campus calling for the end of animal testing, waving signs that said 'Humanity: not just for humans' and 'Dogs should not die for dentures', according to the Augusta Chronicle. Another demonstration is scheduled for December 7. The undercover video, narrated by actress Kim Basinger, focuses on a dog named 'Shy Guy' used as a test subject. Shy Guy and others, Bassinger says, were bought from 'unscrupulous dealers' and put through 'unnecessary suffering'. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT: Scroll down for video . Victim: 'Shy Guy' is the center of a Humane Society video which purports that Georgia Regents University is euthanizing dogs in unnecessary dental research . Unnecessary? The video claims that dogs go through the process of having their teeth pulled and then replaced with dentures before being killed to harvest a small amount of jaw bone to sample . The emaciated dog shakes as Bassinger says you need only 'look into their eyes' to understand just how painful it is to have their teeth pulled and then replaced by dentures. Another dog is shown at the end of the research process, having been euthanized so that researchers could pull a little piece of jaw bone to sample. Humane Society spokesman Stephanie Twining says that researchers use the bone sample to compare GRU's own dentures to that of a competitor. While using dogs for this kind of research is legal, the activists believe it is still a moral  breach. The video also points out that GRU gets its dogs from a dealer that is under investigation by the USDA. Aim: The Humane Society hopes to stop federal research funding to the university (above) after releasing the video . The USDA did in fact file a complaint against the university's dealer - Kenneth H Schroeder - in September saying he improperly obtained dogs, impeded an inspection of his operation in Wells, Minnesota and provided substandard care for dogs there. Mr Schroeder is a random-source class-B dealer which means he can get dogs from auctions, 'free to a good home' ads, animal control, and even shelters to resell to research facilities. From 2005 to 2012, GRU obtained 186 dogs from Mr Schroeder. The six used in dental experiments were obtained in November 2012, operated on in March and euthanized in May. However, there are no allegations that the dogs obtained by the university were improperly obtained. And NBC News points out that GRU is far from the worst offender when it comes to using dogs in experimental research. Taking a stand: GRU pre-veterinary student Hannah Kellems now plans on transferring schools after seeing the video . Central Carolina Community College used 50 dogs in its programs in 2012, twice as much as the 22 GRU reported. And that's nothing compared to the 1,158 Duke University used in 2011, including 101 defined as 'Column D' - to be used in 'experiments...involving accompanying pain or distress to the animals for which appropriate anesthetic, analgesic, or tranquilizing drugs were used.' GRU has since responded to the video, saying that dogs are used 'infrequently' in university research, and that all received anethesia during surgery and pain medication afterwards. 'The research being done with dogs is neither frivolous nor unnecessary, as alleged by the investigation, and is performed in order to develop safe, effective dental procedures for people,' said Dr Mark Hamrick, GRU's Senior Vice President of Research in a statement. The investigation has so upset one GRU undergrad, she plans on switching schools. Pre-veterinary science student Hannah Kellems said it took her about two hours to be able to watch the video start to finish without looking away. Seeing the whole video straight convinced her and another student to transfer schools. 'What kind of veterinarian would I be if I stuck at a school that was potentially abusing animals? That goes against everything I'm for,' Ms Kellems told the Aiken Standard.","The Humane Society released a video last week showing dogs being used as test subjects in dental experiments at Georgia Regents University .

The leaders of the House and Senate intelligence committees say the terrorism threat against the United States is increasing and Americans aren't as safe as they were a year or two ago. Senator Dianne Feinstein says there are more terrorist groups than ever, with more sophisticated and hard-to-detect bombs. The California Democrat says ‘there is huge malevolence out there’. Scroll down for video... Terror: The leaders of the House and Senate intelligence committees, Senator Dianne Feinstein, right, and Mike Rogers, left, say the terrorism threat against the United States is increasing . Michigan Republican Mike Rogers says there's enormous pressure on U.S. intelligence services ‘to get it right, to prevent an attack’. Rogers says that job is getting more difficult because al-Qaida is changing, with more affiliates around the world. He says those groups that once operated independently of Al-Qaida have now joined them. The lawmakers spoke on CNN's State of the Union in an interview aired Sunday. Feinstein and Rogers agreed that despite the death of Osama bin Laden and drone strikes aimed at decimating al Qaeda's leadership, President Barack Obama's administration has lost ground in the on-going battle with global terrorism. Rogers warned that the Obama administration's successes against high-value targets have fostered a false sense of security. ‘People think that, well, we've got this thing beat,’ Rogers said. ‘And that's just not the case.’ Feinstein said increasingly fundamentalist Islamist groups are gaining power and winning the minds of the disenfranchised in the Middle East and Near Asia. ‘I see more groups; more fundamentalist, more jihadist, more determined to kill to get to where they want to get,’ Feinstein said. More sophisticated: California Democrat, Dianne Feinstein, says there are more terrorist groups than ever . As evidence the U.S. is in greater danger, the California lawmaker cited a rise in fatalities from terrorist-related activities and increasingly specialized and dangerous technology available to terrorists. Feinstein specifically highlighted bombs as a growing threat to American security - and not the kind of improvised devices that plagued U.S. armed forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, or rudimentary explosives like the pressure-cooker bomb used by the Boston marathon bombers. She said terror groups had already tried, on four separate occasions, to send these newer, more deadly explosives into the United States. ‘There are new bombs, very big bombs, trucks being reinforced for those bombs,’ Feinstain told CNN. ‘There are bombs that go through (metal-detecting) magnetometers.’ ‘Al-Qaida as we knew it before is metastasizing to something different,’ Rogers said. Joining forces: Michigan Republican Mike Rogers says terrorism groups that once operated independently, now have joined Al-Qaida . Rogers said the terrorist network has changed its modus operandi. Rather than placing a premium on large-scale terror attacks - like those of September 11, 2001, and embassy bombings throughout the 1990s - the new breed of Al-Qaida is more decentralized, he said, something that will make it ’exponentially’ harder to stop the next attack from happening. ‘They've now switched to this notion that smaller events are OK, so if you have more smaller events than bigger events, they think that might still lead to their objectives and their goals,’ Rogers said. Rogers said the potency of the Al-Qaida threat comes at a time of heightened scrutiny of the American intelligence apparatus working to root out the next terror events. ‘The pressure on our intelligence services to get it right, to prevent an attack, are enormous,’ Rogers said. Rogers said the revelations about the agency's methods of surveillance have already prompted three Al-Qaida affiliates to change the way they communicate.","Leaders of the House and Senate intelligence committees, Sen Dianne Feinstein and Mike Rogers, say there are more terrorist groups than ever .

The statement continues: 'Jonathan . endured harassment that went far beyond the traditional locker room . hazing. For the entire season-and-a-half that he was with the Dolphins, . he attempted to befriend the same teammates who subjected him to the . abuse with the hope that doing so would end the harassment. 'This . is a textbook reaction of victims of bullying. Despite these efforts, . the taunting continued. Beyond the well-publicized voice mail with its . racial epithet, Jonathan endured a malicious physical attack on him by a . teammate, and daily vulgar comments such as the quote at the bottom. These facts are not in dispute.' The . NFL Players Association executive director DeMaurice Smith said that he had been in touch with Dolphins' players and said that . every player deserves safe and professional working conditions. Incognito, told a local TV reporter that he was 'just trying to weather the storm right now' as reports have emerged that he may have been under orders to 'toughen up' Martin . After leaving the team last month, . Martin briefly checked himself into a South Florida hospital to be . treated for emotional distress. Incognito . was reportedly told by coaches to 'toughen up' Martin when he subjected . his teammate to abusive voice mail and texts messages. It . has been revealed that after Martin missed two days of organized team . activities (OTAs) last spring, coaches encouraged Incognito, the . offensive line's undisputed leader, to 'get [Martin] into the fold'. Just . days later Incognito left a threatening, and racially offensive . voicemail in which he called Martin, who is bi-racial, a ‘half n*****,’ threatened to slap his mother across the face and uttered the words . ‘I'll kill you.’ The Dolphins suspended Incognito (left) last month for misconduct related to the alleged harassment of Martin, who . abruptly left the team to receive help for emotional issues . Rant: An obscenity-laced video of Richie Incognito has emerged in which he uses the N-word when greeting a teammate . Martin's agent said the second-year player from Stanford was harassed . almost daily by teammates in his rookie year and the hazing continued . into this season. That . prompted an NFL investigation, and the Dolphins suspended Incognito, who . sources said sent Martin threatening and racist messages during the . off-season. Commissioner Roger Goodell appointed a New York lawyer with experience in sports cases to investigate the case. Dolphins' players have rallied passionately defended Incognito and insisting they . didn't see the blowup coming. Most said Martin and Incognito were . friends. 'I don't know why . he's doing this,' offensive tackle Tyson Clabo said. 'And the only . person who knows why, his name is Jonathan Martin.' Guard John Jerry said he never heard Incognito use the racist term included in one voicemail and wouldn't have objected anyway. 'I . would have just laughed it off,' Jerry said. 'I know the type of person . he is, and I know he doesn't mean it that way. Everybody's got friends . that when you're out, they say those type of things. It's never made a . big deal.' Was Incognito under orders? It isn't clear whether the instructions to 'toughen up' Martin came from head coach Joe Philbin, pictured, or another coach . The 30-year-old . Incognito was kicked off his team at Nebraska, and has long had a . reputation as one of the NFL's dirtiest players. But he has been . universally praised by his teammates this week. 'Does he like to give guys a hard time? Yes. Does he like to pester guys and have fun? Yes,' Tannehill said. 'But . he brought a lot of laughter to this locker room, he brought a lot of . cohesiveness to this locker room and he was the best teammate that I . could ask for.' For Martin, . the final straw was a lunchroom prank at the team complex, and he then . left the squad. Tannehill and Jerry said the same prank has been pulled . on many other players. Hijinks are especially common among the offensive linemen, Clabo said. 'We . have a system of basically it's just a big joke, basically,' he said. 'It helps camaraderie. It keeps things light in the room. Everyone . participates. No one is exempt and so I don't see how ... we would all . be guilty of bullying.' Leave: Miami Dolphins tackle Jonathan Martin, 24, pictured, had taken a personal leave of absence from the team which has been blamed on the persistent teasing of his teammates .

'It's tough for me, because you can't help a situation that you didn't know existed - that no one on this team knew existed. 'We . have a bunch of good guys in this locker room.

Around 6,000 people in the UK every year have major limbs amputated and in the U.S., this figure rises to a staggering 185,000 - creating an ever- increasing need for more life-like prosthetics. A team of researchers has developed a procedure that involves reassigning nerves in other parts of the amputee's body meaning they can control their prosthetics using brain signals. This team of scientists and doctors from the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago (RIC) developed the procedure called targeted muscle reinnervation (TMI). A team of researchers in Chicago has developed a procedure that involves reassigning nerves in other parts of an amputee's body meaning they can control prosthetics using brain signals. Doctors have already used the treatment successfully on amputee James Young, pictured . They have already used the treatment successfully on an electrical line worker from Chicago and are offering the treatment to the public. During a report looking into the business of bionics by CNBC, line worker James Young said: ‘It's actually amazing, I actually feel these arms are part of me, and I'm running them.’ Young lost both his arms during an accident at work in 2010. The therapy involved reassigning nerves that once controlled his arms and hands, to his chest and in particular his pectoral muscles, through a complex series of nerve treatments and muscle transfer. This was coupled with physical therapy. Following his treatment, Young was fitted with prosthetics that he can control just by thinking about moving them. The RIC also recently created the world’s first prosthetic leg that can be controlled using brain signals. Amputee James Young, pictured, lost both his arms during an accident at work in 2010.

A council has come under fire for putting up signs warning of fines for littering in three different languages – and none of them is English. Labour-run Haringey council was accused of wasting taxpayers’ money on the signs which are ‘unintelligible’ to the majority of passers-by. The tri-lingual signs have sprung up in North London to the alarm of local residents. Rubbish: The new signs put up by Haringey council warn against littering in Polish, Kurdish and Turkish . The large signs have been attached to lamposts warning of a £75 fixed penalty for anyone caught dropping litter or throwing rubbish from their car. It status that it is an offence under the Environmental Protection Act 1990, and states that fines can be as high as £2,500. But the warnings are written in Greek, Turkish and Slovenian- with the only English being the name of the council under its black and orange logo. Fines: The signs warn of £75 fixed penalty charges, rising to £2,500 for anyone caught dropping litter . The signs have raised eyebrows on the streets of Haringey. Kay Carter, local resident and Conservative activist, said: ‘This is yet another appalling waste of money from Labour-run Haringey council. ‘If signs are necessary they should be in English. It's ridiculous to waste council taxpayers money on signs that target a small segment of the local population and are unintelligible to the rest.’ Earlier this year Haringey council was accused of ordering CCTV 'spy' cars to hit minimum targets for issuing penalty notices - despite the practice being illegal. The alleged policy revealed in a series of leaked emails. They showed the council's CCTV cars were told to issue at least 260 fines a day - a total of 87,360 a year. The council has denied imposing a quota for fines. A Haringey Council spokesman said: 'Littering is an offence that our residents rightly expect us to tackle, and that includes issuing on-the-spot fines to people caught littering. 'However, these are old signs that were used for a limited time in areas where a number of people caught littering did not understand English.

Online retail giant Amazon is considering offering its much-anticipated smartphone for free, it has been reported. The retailer is understood to be aiming to 'undercut rivals' and 'grab a meaningful market share' by tempting consumers using iPhones and Galaxy phones - which normally cost about $200 (£127) - to switch to their free version. However, it is thought the company, which is already behind the hugely popular Kindle e-reader, may require its smartphone users to sign up to services such as its loyalty programme, Amazon Prime. 'Apple's nightmare': If Amazon, which is already behind the popular Kindle e-reader (right) can conquer the market with free phones, Apple may be forced to lower the prices on its iPhone (left) Technology blogger Jessica Lessin claims that 'people familiar with Amazon's effort' confirmed the company was considering offering the smartphones for free. But it is expected to come with some strings attached. 'One of them is whether Amazon would require its smartphone owners to . pay for services such as Amazon Prime, the company’s loyalty program,' Lessin writes in her blog. 'But the people familiar with the matter said that Amazon wants the . device to be free whether or not people sign up for a new wireless plan . at the same time. (Wireless carriers typically discount the price of . devices if customers sign up for a one or two-year wireless contract.)' Cost: Smartphones like the Samsung Galaxy typically cost about $200 (£127) One of the sources says Amazon - which is yet to throw its hat into the smartphone game but is rumored to be interested in doing so - has been in communication with wireless service providers about offering the phone on other carriers. The phone, however, would be offered directly to consumers through a website. Lessin said the free strategy 'isn't set in stone - it depends on a few things that Amazon still needs to work out. For example, the company will need to figure out the financial arrangements with hardware suppliers who are actually manufacturing the phones - something one of Lessin's sources isn't entirely sure is feasible. Free? Amazon is rumored to be considering undercutting its competitors when it enters the smartphone market by offering free phones . Lessin claims that regardless of whether Amazon phones end up being free, or cost significantly less than other, similar phones, the mere fact that the company is considering the strategy indicates how it plans to get into the phone business: 'undercut rivals and grab meaningful market share.' If it works, other smartphone companies could potentially be forced to follow suit and offer their products for much lower prices, or even for free.

A psychology professor accused of masterminding the murder of her alleged rapist in Orange County, California, has spoken out, saying she is the victim of a violent rape and of her abusive ex-boyfriend, who murdered her rapist. Patricia Esparza, 39, says 18 years ago she was forced to join a group of people, including her then ex-boyfriend Gianni Van, 44, in kidnapping Gonzalo Ramirez, 24, and witnessed them beating him as revenge for allegedly raping Esparza in her dorm room. Esparza is one of four suspects to face charges for the 1995 killing of Ramirez, whose body was found hacked to death with a meat cleaver on the side of a road in Orange County. A fifth suspect died in July. Cold case: Police arrested Esparza when she reentered the U.S. for an academic conference for a crime committed 18 years ago . Accused: Norma Patricia Esparza listens during a news conference in Santa Ana, California, on Wednesday . The married mother and professor at Webster University in Geneva, Switzerland, was offered a deal: plead guilty and face just three years behind bars. She refused the deal, saying she won't admit to something she didn't do. If convicted for the murder of Gonzalo Ramirez, she could face a life sentence. Esparza spoke to NBC's Today from her prison cell yesterday. She told Today that her then ex-boyfriend Gianni Van kidnapped Ramirez and forced her to be a party to a violent beating, then two weeks later made her marry him, knowing that as his spouse she could not be compelled to testify against him. Esparza told the Pasadena Star News that she and Van had never lived together. Speaking out: Esparza spoke to NBC's Today show about the case, saying she was forced into witnessing violence against Ramirez by Van but didn't know he had been murdered . 'Never, ever did I give any indication that I wanted Gonzalo Ramirez to be harmed,' she told Dateline. 'What I can tell you is that I was dragged, pressured, bullied, intimidated into that night when they actually took Gonzalo Ramirez,' she said. 'I never saw him dead. I didn't know that he had been dead. But I was terrorized by the violence that I witnessed.' Esparza says she was not aware Ramirez had been murdered until weeks later when she was questioned by police. Esparza, a professor at Webster University in Geneva, Switzerland, was arrested in the cold case murder late last year after re-entering the U.S. for an academic conference. The four other suspects in the case have all pleaded not guilty. Locked up: Esparza was taken into custody after rejecting a plea deal that would see her serve a sentence of three years . Accused: Ex-husband of Norma Patricia Esparza, Gianni Van (left), and Shannon Gries (right) Involved: Diane Tran (left) has plead not guilty in the crime, and Kody Tran (right) would have been charged had he not shot himself in a standoff with police last year . 'It just hurts me so much that I had . been raped, and here he [Van] is, instead of consoling me, he destroyed . the rest of my life,' she said. 'You know, the abuse was difficult, the rape was difficult, but dragging me through that night, it haunts me.' Prosecutors say Esparza is playing the 'victim card' and is using her psychology knowledge to sway public opinion to her side. 'She’s a very sophisticated defendant,' prosecutor Susan Kang Schroeder told Pasadena Star News. 'She . has a Ph.D in psychology and she knows how to play on people’s . emotions, including the use of her 4-year-old daughter as a prop at the . press conference. This is a woman who is trying to act like the victim . in this case when the real victim was brutally murdered and the case . went unsolved for 20 years.' Respected: Esparza, seen here in her capacity as a psychology professor teaching a class . Esparza refused the plea deal on November 20, saying, 'The principle of what they're asking me is to plead guilty to something that they know I am not responsible for,' she said. She . will now face trial for one felony count of special circumstance murder . - a charge that can carry a life sentence without parole. Prosecutors are calling the murder of Gonzalo Ramirez a 'revenge killing.' They allege that on 15 April, 1995, a 20-year-old Esparza was at a bar with a group of friends . including former boyfriend Gianni Van, when she pointed out Ramirez, . claiming he had raped her in her dorm room at Pomona College a few . months earlier. Wife and mother: Norma Patricia Esparza receives a hug from her four-year-old daughter, Arianna . According to the prosecution, Esparza, . Van, Kody Tran, Diane Tran and Shannon 'Jailbird' Gries followed Ramirez . when he left the bar in the early hours of the following morning. They intentionally rear-ended his vehicle, say prosecutors, forcing him to get out of the car to inspect the damage. He was then kidnapped. His body was found on the side of Sand Canyon Road in Santa Ana hours later. Esparza . says she was forced by the aggressive Van to identify Ramirez and then . coerced to keep the secret of his murder for almost two decades. Diane Tran, Shannon Gries and Gianni Van have also been charged. All have pleaded not guilty. Kody Tran died after shooting himself in a  standoff with police last year. According to the Los Angeles Times, . Esparza says she met Ramirez in a Santa Ana nightclub. The next morning . he asked her to breakfast and offered to drive her and some friends . back to Pomona College. Once in her dorm room, he raped Esparza, who went to a school nurse and was given the morning-after pill. She was too ashamed to report the rape to authorities and the nurse did not advise her to do so. Young family: Esparza married Jorge Mancillas following her divorce from Van and they have a four-year-old daughter . Jailed: Norma Patricia Esparza, pictured with her husband, Jorge Mancillas, has been taken into custody . 'I don't think I was thinking at that . time,' she said. 'I felt ashamed. I felt guilty. I didn't want to come . forward because I didn't want my family to know.' Julie Ann Rojas, who was Gries then-girlfriend, testified that she was with Van and Esparza the night Ramirez died. Cold case: When investigators learned Esparza and Van were divorced, they re-opened the murder case of Gonzalo Ramirez . She . said Van, Gries and Kody Tran attacked Ramirez while she and Esparza . went to a bar. After about an hour Roja and Esparza went to the . transmission shop owned by Kody Tran where Esparza said she saw Ramirez . tied and hanging from the ceiling. Esparza's . current husband Jorge Mancillas, a world-renowned medical researcher, said that his wife was told that Ramirez was 'roughed up' and was unaware of the murder until weeks later when she was questioned by police. Esparza, who says she suffered years of sexual abuse by her father as a child, told reporters at a news conference Wednesday 20 November that she lived in fear of Van for years after the attack. 'All I knew is that I wanted to survive,' she said. 'All I knew was that these people were dangerous and I just needed to stay quiet and withdraw and come out of that night alive.' Senior deputy district attorney Scott Simmons said there is sufficient evidence 'to prove she is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.' Mancillas and Esparza's four-year-old daughter Arianna were in the courtroom as she was handcuffed. The family lives in a small town in France on the Swiss border and Esparza is an assistant professor of psychology and counseling at Webster University. She will return to court on December 23. Esparza and Mancillas have set up a petition at change.org to try to persuade Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas to drop the charges against Esparza. 'We are astonished that Norma Patricia, a rape victim, is now being treated as a criminal. We are also concerned about the effect this past year has had on her 4-year-old daughter and the long-term impact this will have if the situation is not resolved in her favor,' the petition reads. 'In continuing to pursue her you are sending a troubling message to other rape victims who already have a sense that they will not receive justice within the legal system.'","Norma Patricia Esparza, 39, is charged in the murder of Gonzalo Ramirez .

Two Fargo radio personalities who photographed the remains of western North Dakota's pioneer towns for a coffee table book discovered a surprise when they returned for volume two. Some of the 'ghost' towns had come back to life, thanks largely to the oil boom.One of the images that Troy Larson and Terry Hinnenkamp had hoped to capture for the second volume of 'Ghosts of North Dakota' was an abandoned church in Fortuna, near the borders of Montana and Saskatchewan. Circled: This photo provided by Terry Hinnenkamp shows an abandoned one-room school house in Clear Lake Township in Kidder County, North Dakota, featured in the book 'Ghosts of North Dakota Volume 2' Witching: Leann Pelvit searches for forgotten graves using an ancient method called 'witching' along the Dakota-Montana border to protect them from being disturbed in the explosion of development spurred by the region's oil boom . When they arrived, they found a recreational vehicle and semi-trailer parked in front of the building, ruling out a photo shoot. And then there's nearby Appam, which was featured in the first edition. The pair was surprised to find about 30 recreational vehicles and trailers set up behind a shelter belt that once guarded the town. 'We were shocked to see that some of the towns we photographed in 2005 or 2006 had people living there now,' Larson said. 'We always said it would be a happy day when we could say one of these towns turned the corner and starting coming back. We didn't expect it to happen like this.' New growth: A tree grows through a derelict vehicle near the old ghost town of Dore which has seen an economic and population turnaround with increased oil activity in the North Dakota region . Relic: This abandoned house photographed by Troy Larson for the book 'Ghosts of North Dakota Volume 2' is located near Barton, North Dakota, in the northern part of the state . Larson knows that the rebirth is temporary and might be the makings of future ghost town photos. 'If we're still above the ground, because Lord knows how long the boom will last out there, we fully intend to go back out there and photograph what is left,' Larson said. 'It would be a very different type of ghost town. What is a man camp going to look like when nobody is left? Will there even be a man camp?' Rebirth: The former school superintendent's house on the east side of Omemee, North Dakota, an area where nearly 150 people from 28 states, Canada, Australia and New Zealand have purchased property in this ghost town on auction sites like eBay . New boom: A donkey pump extracts  oil from the earth at an abandoned farm near the old ghost town of Dore, North Dakota, which  Dore has seen a rebirth with the booming oil activity in western North Dakota . The second edition is 88 pages and features towns such as Bantry, Barton and Bentley, along with Raleigh, Roseville and Roth. Larson's favorite photographs are one he took of a house in Sims, which is featured on the cover, and one by Hinnenkamp of a one-room schoolhouse in Clear Lake Township that is surrounded by rings of crops on a foggy morning. The Sims house: This abandoned house in Sims, North Dakota is featured on the cover of the book 'Ghosts of North Dakota Volume 2' which documents ghost towns throughout the state . 'There was no way we could have known there was going to be a crop circle around the school house or it was going to be all foggy and misty when we showed up there,' Larson said. 'It seemed like the shot was just presenting itself to us when we got there.' The first book has sold about 3,000 copies, Larson said, and the pair had to back-order more books to meet demand. That allowed them to finance the second volume, which is available on the group's website. 'Being able to do one book was more than we hoped for, to be honest,' Larson said. 'We're poor radio guys and never had the money to do a book. We were pleasantly surprised that we were successful and it all worked out.'","Troy Larson and Terry Hinnenkamp photographed abandoned towns for a coffee table book .

A teacher accused of sexually assaulting a student more than 50 times has been arrested after turning herself in. Carrie Miller, 24, is accused of sexual assault and enticement through electronic devices for allegedly having sexual contact with a then-15-year-old boy in the fall of 2012. Miller, a Spanish teacher at Johnson County Central High School from Tecumseh, was married at the time of the assaults. Turned herself in: Carrie Miller, 24, a Johnson County Central Spanish Teacher accused of sexually assaulting a 15 year student, was in Johnson County Court Wednesday . According to court documents, Miller had sexual contact with the boy between 50 and 60 times during the fall of 2012. She was arrested Tuesday and went before a judge Wednesday, who set her bail at $25,000. The probable cause affidavit says the two routinely exchanged text messages, graphic photographs and inappropriate conversations. The alleged encounters were usually arranged by cell phone and took place in both Johnson County and an abandoned farmhouse in neighboring Nemaha County, where she will also face charges. Career: Miller taught Spanish at Johnson County Central High School at the time of the assaults . Miller was married to a Lincoln man in September 2011 and the couple filed for divorce in February 2013. According to ABC 8, the information that led to Miller's arrest was provided by a tipster. Deputy Johnson County Attorney Rick Smith said accusations of this nature rarely happen in the area. 'This is the first time I've heard of it in my 32 years,' he said. Local parents were shocked at the allegations. Married: Miller had only been married a year when the alleged assaults occurred . Grandparent Pat McKinney whose children and now grandchildren attend the school said her reaction was 'Shock, just shock.' 'Children at this age are easily manipulated,' McKinney told 1011, 'and easily led into doing something.' McKinney and another parent, Carolyn Justus, said that they had heard nothing from the school about the incident and only found out about Miller's arrest through the media. The school has not commented on Miller's arrest, saying only that the school is dealing with a 'personnel' issue. Miller's next court date is February 26.","Carrie Miller, 24, is accused of having sex with a 15-year-old male student .

A woman who had £15,000 weight loss surgery on the NHS shed eight stone before piling the pounds back on. Lana Harber is now obese again and is warning patients that the operation is not the quick fix many hope for. The 41-year-old lost an impressive 8st after she underwent a gastric bypass operation on the recommendation of doctors. Before: Lana Harber was 19 stone before she had £15,000 weight loss surgery on the NHS . But after shrinking from 19st to 11st in the two years after her operation, she has piled on the pounds after falling back into bad eating habits. Miss Harber, from Chatham, Kent, also suffers from polycystic ovarian syndrome which hampers her ability to lose weight naturally. She said: ‘I blame no-one but myself, but my experiences have made me realise that gastric operations, which are often viewed as a quick fix, don’t make any difference if the root causes of obesity aren’t addressed. ‘I’ve had low self-esteem rooted in difficult experiences from my childhood that have caused me to comfort eat over the years.’ Success: Miss Harber lost an impressive 8 stone after the surgery to reduce the size of her stomach . Yo-yo: But she has now piled 3st back on again due to comfort eating - and is warning others that weight-loss surgery isn't a cure-all . Despite displaying the symptoms of . polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) all her adult life, Miss Harber was not . diagnosed with the condition until she was in her mid-30s and weighed . 17st. She said: ‘I enjoyed the occasional . chocolate bar but I didn’t habitually drink litres of fizzy drinks and I . wasn’t always out eating enormous meals. I found it confusing that I . managed to become quite so big. ‘I . learned that PCOS creates problems with insulin production, which . affects the way food is processed in the body, which is why people with . the condition often struggle with weight gain. Miss Harber at her lowest weight, weighing 11st and wearing a size 10. She said: 'I¿ve had low self-esteem rooted in difficult experiences from my childhood that have caused me to comfort eat over the years' ‘It put my weight problems in context . but was difficult to hear - I had suffered a miscarriage a year earlier . and had experienced a rough few months. It was painful to get the . diagnosis. ‘I became more depressed which meant I became more sedentary and comfort ate. I kept gaining weight.’ BEFORE BYPASS SURGERY . Breakfast: Slice of toast or porridge . Lunch: Cheese sandwiches . Dinner: Curry with rice or pasta served with chicken or vegetables . Snacks: Half a packet of digestives and two chocolate bars, with odd helpings of chocolate cake, muffins or flapjacks. She said: 'Main meals weren't a problem - but snacking was. I couldn't help dipping into sweet foods throughout the day.' AFTER BYPASS SURGERY . First month: Flavoured milk three times a day . Second month: Pureed food or ready-brek twice a day. Six months: Small amount of soft pasta or soft rice twice a day. After a year she could manage half a sandwich for a main meal. But as the months passed, she began gorging on chocolate bars as a source of comfort food. She said: 'It didn't matter to me what chocolate bar it . was, as long as it was chocolate. I fell back into the habit without really . thinking about it.' HER DIET TODAY . Breakfast: Porridge with banana . Lunch: Cup-a-soup with a small roll . Dinner: Portion-controlled chilli con carne or pasta dish . Snacks: Yogurt or fruit. An endocrinologist referred Miss . Harber to a specialist team at St George’s Hospital in London and after a . year she was told she had been recommended for a gastric bypass . operation. The NHS-funded operation, which costs up to £15,000, took place in March 2009, when she weighed 19st. Miss . Harber said: ‘It was reasoned that it was better in the long-run to get . my weight down quickly to prevent serious problems like diabetes and . heart disease. ‘I’d never thought about surgery. It had never occurred to me that it would have been offered. But when it was suggested, I paid close attention to what the doctors said. ‘I was surprised at the offer, but I understood the logic. It would have cost the health service more to treat me if I was morbidly obese and diabetic.’ After discussing the matter with her parents, Miss Harber, who is a support worker for deaf people, decided the gastric bypass operation was the right option. She said: ‘I signed a disclaimer which confirmed I understood that the operation could have complications and serious health consequences. For the two nights leading up to the operation I was very anxious. ‘I ate like a baby for the first few months, slowly introducing solid food back to my diet. It was a challenge, but a dream come true to see the weight drop off so quickly. ‘Having had no confidence for years, to start thinking about what outfits I would wear to work and for when I was out socialising with friends was truly wonderful.’ But by the spring of 2011, Miss Harber realised that her gastric bypass had not been the fix-all option many hope it will be. She said: ‘I have painful memories from my childhood and self-esteem issues which the gastric bypass was never going to address. ‘I found myself subconsciously dipping back into the comfort eating. The weight started to creep back up.’ Today, Miss Harber weighs 14st and has excess skin left from her weight loss. She is now having counselling and has started a healthy eating and exercise routine . Today, Miss Harber weighs 14st and has excess skin left from her weight loss. She said: ‘I’m back at being obese again but I can see a solution. I have a good support network of friends and I’m sure I can get that 3st off again. ‘I’m having counselling to address the self-esteem issues and has started a healthy eating and exercise routine. ‘My excess skin will never be removed unless I’m judged to be an exceptional case by the health services. I feel embarrassed talking to my doctor about it, because I feel I’ve already had so much help with my weight loss. ‘There’s an awful feeling that I’m not doing my part to live up to the effort that other people went to for my operation. ‘But I’ve come to realise that, sadly, if you don’t address the root problems, all the benefits of such operations can be undone. ‘Today whenever I hear anyone say they’re going for weight loss surgery, I always make sure I share my experiences. Patients need to be very mindful following their operations. ‘If there are psychological or other issues at the root of the weight gain, those issues need to tackled first, or all the effort in the world can go to waste.’","Lana Harber, 41, initially lost an impressive 8st after the op five years ago .

"By . Lydia Warren . PUBLISHED: . 17:54 EST, 30 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 15:21 EST, 31 January 2014 . Twins set to inherit tobacco heiress Doris Duke's $1 billion fortune were beaten, forced to eat their own feces and made to play Russian Roulette as children, they have claimed in a chilling interview. Georgia and Patterson Inman, 16, spoke out in their first television interview on Thursday about how they endured years of abuse at the hands of caregivers hired by their meth-addicted father. They lived with their father, Walker 'Skipper' Inman Jr - Duke's nephew - until he overdosed in 2010. They now live with their . mother, Daisha, and will inherit part of Duke's fortune when they . turn 21. Their stories of alleged abuse come in stark contrast to how their lives appeared - holidaying in Fiji, taking diamonds to school for show-and-tell and keeping exotic pets, such as camels and chimps. Scroll down for videos . Struggles: Twins Georgia and Patterson Inman, who are heirs to Dors Duke's tobacco fortune, have spoken out about the abuse they allegedly endured at the hands of their father and caretakers . 'People see this luxurious life but at the same time we were living in hell,' Patterson told Dr Phil during the exclusive interview that aired on Thursday. The alleged abuse began after their parents divorced and their father - who received an estimated $90,000 monthly inheritance - won custody in 2000, when the twins were two. In the years to follow, they were burned with boiling water, forced to stay in a feces-filled basement, made to live for days without food and locked behind dead-bolted doors, they told Dr Phil. Georgia recounted a putrid stink that permeated their Wyoming mansion and how they were fed stale food in a rat-infested home where babysitters would come and go. Pain: Georgia shook as she said how she was allegedly burned, starved and forced to eat her own vomit . Fighter: Patterson said that he is determined to find the people who abused him and his sister . 'They would play Russian roulette with . us,' Georgia said of their caretakers. 'They thought it was funny. They'd load the gun, spin it and shoot it at me and my brother.' She . claimed that they also tied her feet and taped her mouth and would force her to eat her own sick from the . carpet. 'She got mad because I couldn't eat it,' she said of one woman paid to look after them. 'It kept making me sick. It was really disgusting.' Her brother recalled another time the nannies made him eat his own feces. 'They were feeding me my own . [expletive],' he said. 'I just remember being in the basement . and they were like pretending it was food. They were like, ""Chew! Chew!""' On other occasions, Georgia said they threw her down a flight of stairs and locked them alone in the . basement. They were also dropped into a boiling bathtub, she said. Younger years: When the twins were toddlers, their parents divorced and their father won custody . Trying to move on: The teenagers said they are now happier - but that they will always have scars . 'We . got placed in hot water,' she said. 'It'd scold us really bad. I . thought my skin was melting away. It feels like you're on fire.' But Georgia said the abuse didn't just come at the hands of their caretakers. While Patterson has fond memories of his father - blowing up vehicles, collecting guns and speaking to hookers aboard boats in New Zealand - Georgia's thoughts are not so happy. She told Dr Phil that her father also beat them, punching them in their faces and heads. Her brother refused to speak about the claims. 'He would pick me up by the ankle and . just drop me on my head because he wanted to make me stupid,' Georgia . claimed. 'He used to slice my feet up with knives.' They both claimed they saw their father overdose regularly and that adults had told them to revive him by splashing cold water on his face. Speaking out: The twins spoke candidly with Dr Phil in their first television interview . Speechless: Dr Phil could not contain his shock as the teenagers spoke about the alleged abuse . Patterson added that their friends' parents never wanted to bring their children to the home because of their dad's penchant for pornography and because he liked to walk around naked. '[The money] didn't matter to me,' Georgia . said. 'If someone were to look at me and say ""wow"", I would say let's . try lives. I just wanted to be free. I was trapped because of it.' She claimed that her father even gave people wads of cash to silence them when they saw the children being abused. 'There's no hope when that happens,' she said. 'I thought I was going to be dead.' But they weren't just witnesses to their own abuse. In one particularly frightening episode when they were four years old, they saw a man killed in front of them, they said. They were in a kitchen in Japan where a . man endured a grim assault for stealing; their father warned them that . they would be punished similarly if they ever stole. Parents: They now live with their mother, Daisha (left), after their father (right) died of an overdose in 2010 . Former home: They lived with their father on this estate, but current court cases ban them from visiting . 'They put him on a chair,' Patterson recounted. 'They . stripped him nude. They were sticking an object - bamboo - between the splits in the chair. They did it nice and slowly.' The bamboo was placed inside the man and he was slowly speared to death, the twins said. Georgia added that a man also sliced open his stomach, leaving his intestines to fall out. 'I was scared, I was crying,' Patterson said, breaking down. 'I was terrified. I tried to grab on to my . father. He brushed me away. I think this whole thing was about stealing. It really messed with my head a lot.' Now the twins are hoping to bring their abusers - the babysitters who were paid to care for them as their father and stepmother abused drugs - to justice. 'I want these people to be put away,' Patterson said, beginning to smile. 'I want to see all these people in a . jail cell with me giving a thumbs up. 'I'm pissed off. I'm coming after the bastards. This is a battle cry. This is serious. They're going down. 'Richest girl in the world': The twins are the great niece and nephew of American Heiress Doris Duke, pictured in the 1930s. Georgia Inman bears a striking resemblance to the tobacco heiress . Heiress: Duke is pictured with her first husband, financier James Cromwell. They had a daughter who died and Duke had no other children, so she left her fortune to her nephew, the twins' father . 'I don't want to be a victim. I want to be a victor.' Since the death of their father, the twins have not had an easy life. Their money is currently locked up in a legal dispute between their mother Daisha - the fourth wife of Walker Inman Jr - and Mr Inman's fifth wife and their mother has made headlines on numerous occasions as she battles to get access to the children's money. The trust is run by JPMorgan, who said in court filings last year that it had to reign in payments after the twins' mother requested exorbatant amounts to treat them. Ms Inman has argued that the trustees have gone too far and neglected to pay the children's legitimate expenses. An interview with the twins' mother will air on Dr Phil on Friday.","Georgia and Patterson Inman spoke out in their first television interview about their abusive childhood and meth-addicted father .
