"The Royal Bank of Scotland said today it would relocate to England if voters choose Scottish independence next week. It is another hammer blow for separatists as three major banks now look set to quit Scotland if there is a Yes campaign wins. RBS, based in Scotland since its formation in 1727 , said today 'it would be necessary to re-domicile the bank's holding company' if next Thursday’s referendum ends the 307-year Union. Banks say they fear being downgraded if they lost the stability of the Union and RBS and Lloyds may even ask for emergency Westminster legislation to help speed through a move to England. Big move: The Royal Bank of Scotland has revealed it would move its headquarters from Edinburgh, pictured, to London if voters choose independence next week . RBS employs 12,000 staff north of the border and is still headquartered in Gogarburn, to the west of Scottish capital Edinburgh,  but this main base would be moved south. Lloyds Banking Group, which includes Halifax and Bank of Scotland and has 16,000 staff in Scotland, yesterday announced it would move its headquarters to London, in what has been called Alex Salmond's 'Black Wednesday'. Blow: Alex Salmond's chances have improved in the poll but big businesses are unconvinced by the Yes campaign . Scotland’s third bank, Clydesdale, was also reported to be preparing to leave and Edinburgh-based Standard Life said it would partially move to England, putting up to 5,000 finance jobs at risk. And Edinburgh-based Standard Life unveiled drastic plans to partially move to England, putting up to 5,000 finance jobs at risk. The First Minister says reports of banks leaving Scotland are 'nonsense' and 'scaremongering'. The developments will ease the panic that followed a poll on Sunday putting the Yes camp ahead for the first time and led to the three main party leaders making emergency trips to Scotland to campaign . Yesterday’s Survation poll found that 53 per cent of those who have made their mind up are planning to say No, against 47 per cent saying Yes. One in ten is still to decide. In a further blow to Mr Salmond two of the world’s largest oil giants yesterday came out against independence, as the industry overwhelmingly rejected his claims on how much oil remains in the North Sea. BP and Shell both declared their support for the Union yesterday, throwing their weight behind a new warning from oil tycoon Sir Ian Wood that oil reserves in Scotland have been hugely overestimated by the Yes campaign. Shoppers in Scotland are likely to face higher prices if the country votes in favour of independence, one of the UK's leading retailers has warned. John Lewis Partnership chairman Sir Charlie Mayfield said it had no intention of reducing its commercial presence north of the border, where it has nine shops, a contact centre and employs more than 3,000 people. But he cautioned that firms were unlikely to continue sharing the burden of higher operating costs in Scotland across all UK customers in the event of the break up of the Union. He said he would 'regret' any move which damaged the retailers' partnership model. 'We have got a thriving business in Scotland, with nine shops, a contact centre and over 3,000 partners working there,' Sir Charlie told BBC Radio 4's Today. 'The debate has clearly become very, very fractious. As a businessman it is not my place to tell Scottish voters how to vote in next week's referendum. 'But I will say two things. 'From a business perspective there will be economic consequences to a Yes vote, not just in uncertainty but some of the turmoil we are hearing about. 'And it is also the case that it does cost more money to trade in parts of Scotland and therefore those hard costs, in the event of a Yes vote, are more likely to be passed on.'","RBS joins Lloyds, Clydesdale and Standard Life in making plans to relocate .

"These amazing images were captured by a professional photographer who flew along the Adriatic coastline in Italy over the summer. As thousands of sun worshipers lazed on the golden sands, sheltering underneath massive beach umbrellas, German photographer Bernhard Lang took these stunning photographs. The colourful umbrellas create amazing geometric patterns which contrast dramatically with the golden sand and azure-coloured sea. From his aerial vantage point the people on the beach and swimming in the sea are mere specks compared to the bright coloured umbrellas. Mr Lang told My Modern Met: 'The message might be to show the impact of human beings on the natural environment. 'On the other side, the birds-eye view reveals that we are just small creatures, not as important as we think we are.' German photographer Bernhard Lang flew along the length of the Adriatic coast in Italy with his camera to capture images of people at the beach . The unusual beach photographs have turned the people enjoying themselves into little specks with the beach umbrellas creating the most amazing patterns . Mr Lang took different style photographs, with long shots showing long sections of beach with others zoomed in to concentrate on the complex visual patterns . In some of the photographs, such as the one on the left, the people are completely unaware they are being photographed, but there are people looking up on the right . From the air it is possible to see how almost every inch of sand is used on a busy summer's day on the Adriatic coastline . This beach appears to offer slightly more privacy with some clear space between the rows of sun loungers all of which are placed in impressively straight lines . In this photograph the footsteps of the holiday makers have made interesting patterns in the sand as people move from the shaded area towards the bar . Bernhard Lang said his work questions the impact that humans have on the earth, but also shows how small and insignificant they actually are . The aerial photographs show that along large sections of the Italian Adriatic coast, not one inch of sand is wasted as sun loungers are placed up to the tide mark . From 1,000 feet in the air, the beach volley game looks slightly strange as the net appears as a small green line . Here the beige colour of the umbrellas makes them virtually anonymous with in this instance the main focus are the people surrounding the small red boat . In comparison to the previous photograph, the umbrellas in this image create a confusing optical illusion  making it difficult to focus for any length of time . These central sun loungers seem to be surrounded by bamboo fences to protect the sun worshipers' privacy - but not from Mr Lang's eye in the sky . From his aerial platform, Bernhard Lang was able to photograph this amazing sand castle art which was hidden behind a tall fence . From the air, Bernhard Lang had almost unlimited visibility on this warm summer day where thousands of Italians decide to decamp for a bit . Here the opposing colours look almost like some form of ancient board game while the sand appears to have a leather-like consistency . The angle of this photograph is so acute it is difficult to decide whether the image is the correct way up, adding to its interest . In this first photograph, the sun bathers seem less interested in having their own umbrella compared to the people in the right hand photograph . Along this section of beach many of people have turned their loungers away from the water and as the shadows show, towards the sun for that all important even tan .","German photographer Bernhard Lang flew along the Adriatic coast in Italy to capture these amazing images .

"A video has surfaced showing two witnesses' incredulous reactions to the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown by a Ferguson, Missouri police officer. In the video, one of the contractors standing near the scene throws his own hands up in the air  and shouts 'he had his f****** hands in the air' minutes after Brown was gunned down. Officer Darren Wilson shot dead unarmed 18-year-old Brown on August 9, in an incident that triggered a national debate on race relations and two weeks of widespread protests. The men's reactions were captured on a cellphone-recorded video obtained by CNN. Scroll down for video . Michael Brown (left) was shot by police officer Darren Wilson (right) during a confrontation on August 9 . One of the men, who spoke to CNN under condition of anonymity, told the broadcaster he saw Brown running away from a police car. Brown then put his hands up and 'the officer was chasing him', he said. He saw Wilson fire a shot at Brown while his back was turned. The other contractor said he saw Brown's 'brains come out of his head,' adding 'his hands were up.' An autopsy commissioned by Brown's family concluded that he was shot six times, twice in the head. It comes two days after a judge denied a request to release Brown's juvenile records. Following the decision, angry residents of Ferguson then stormed a city council meeting to protest how police have handled the shooting of the 18-year-old and the unrest that followed. Residents of Ferguson storm a city council meeting in protest at how police handled the shooting of Brown . The unrest is still continuing more than a month after the shooting. Pictured are police arresting a protester when a group attempted to shut down Interstate 70 in Berkeley, Missouri yesterday . CNN's new video has surfaced as multiple investigations into both the shooting and Ferguson police force's operating methods have been opened. A Justice Department investigation will scrutinize the organisation's patterns of stops, arrests and use of force, as well as the training the officers receive. In announcing the probe, Attorney General Eric Holder cited a 'history of mistrust' between officers and the residents of Ferguson. He said: 'As a result of this history, and after of a review of documented allegations of incidents, we have determined that there's cause for the Justice Department to open an investigation of whether there is a pattern and practice of officers in Ferguson violating constitutional rights or federal laws.' The community's anger at the shooting resulted in chaos on city streets, with militarized police using tear gas and rubber bullets in an attempt to contain daily riots, vandalism and disorder. Police fire tear gas at protesters on the streets of Ferguson three days after the shooting of Brown last month . The police response to the protests also sparked a national debate on the militarization of police forces . Black community leaders say black residents endure a pattern of harassment and abuse at the hands of the mostly-white police force and claim Brown's shooting was just the most egregious example. The Ferguson Police Department is also conducting an internal review of the case. Police have said Brown was shot after a scuffle that broke out after officer Wilson told the teen and a friend to move out of the street and onto a sidewalk. Supporters of Wilson have defended the officer's actions by saying he was threatened by Brown, who was 6-foot-4 and 300 pounds and was trying to go for the officer's gun. Witnesses, including Brown's friend, told the news media that Brown had his hands up and was surrendering when he was gunned down. Many members of the community claim Brown's shooting was a cold-blooded murder. Police arrest a demonstrator during a protest along Interstate Highway 70 near Ferguson yesterday . The department also released details of a robbery in which video footage showed Brown stealing a box of cigars prior to his confrontation with Wilson. His family released a statement in response, in which they condemned the information release which they said was 'intended to assassinate the character of their son, following such a brutal assassination of his person in broad daylight.' Meanwhile, more protesters were arrested yesterday after attempting to shut down a local highway. The demonstrators were hoping to block the Interstate 70 entrance ramp in the St. Louis suburb, when they were halted by a wall of police officers, KMOV reports. Another demonstrator is restrained by police following yesterday's protest, which was an attempt to get Missouri Governor Jay Nixon to appoint a special prosecutor in the case against Darren Wilson . The aim was to get Missouri Governor Jay Nixon to appoint a special prosecutor in the case against Darren Wilson. Highway Patrol Sergeant Al Nothum said that 35 people were arrested, most on charges of unlawful assembly. Mr Nothum said protesters hurled rocks, concrete blocks, bricks and bottles, leading to four charges of assault on a law enforcement officer. The Missouri Highway Patrol warned protesters: 'Attempting to block an interstate highway is unsafe and unacceptable.'","New cellphone video reveals eye-witnesses' reaction minutes after shooting .

Stripe and butterfly tops are £10 each, the textured blazer is £16 and the leggings £8 each . The launch range consists of 35 pieces, including blazers, skater dresses, embellished and long line tops, leggings and maxi skirts. Prints include breton stripes, florals and jacquard. All pieces are designed in an easy to wear, flattering way while still incorporating a nod to the latest fashion trends.

A survey commissioned by George to mark the launch revealed 64 per cent of women want help with enhancing their curves. Half of the nation's women admit to being unhappy with the shape of their bottoms in particular. The perfect silhouette as voted for by 40 per cent of women belonged to curvaceous Kelly Brook, Holly Willoughby and Kim Kardashian.

Not only are the styles a fashionable and flattering slimline fit, but the cleverly designed pockets, stitching and secret padding will give women curves in all the right places.

We want our customers to feel confident and look great - and I just know they will fall in love with these ingenious figure fixers.

"A heroic father died a tragic death over the weekend when he was killed by an oncoming train as he desperately tried to save the life of his son. Bradley Barngrover, 32, of Fairland, Indiana, was driving with his son when his car stalled on some tracks just moments before a train came through. Barngrover died from his injuries later that day at Indiana University Health Morgan Hospital. His nine-year-old son Jaden survived, and was treated for pain. Tragic end: Bradley Barngrover (above, with wife Krissy and their three children) died after his car stalled on some train tracks over the weekend . According to The Reporter-Times, Barngrover was on his way to purchase the 'new truck of his dreams' at the time of his death. The train hit the car after father and son had exited according to eyewitnesses, but  the force of the train hitting the back of Barngrover's truck caused the vehicle to smash into him. This after the father struggled to free his son from the car. In addition to Jaden, he leaves behind two young daughters, Amaya and Eva, and his wife, Krissy Barngrover. Barngrover worked for a local construction company and was preparing to graduate from Ivy Tech Community College with a degree in automotive technology. A page has been set up for donations to help his family pay for the funeral. Newlyweds: Though they had dated for 12 years, Barngrover and his wife Krissy (above) married just last year . 'I am so thankful for all the people that have been so supportive to me and my children throughout this,' his wife wrote on the page. 'I still keep hoping to wake up and have my sweet husband laying next to me like he was supposed to for the rest of my life. Thank you to everyone for the support, thoughts, and prayers.

"So many journalists are camped outside Michael Schumacher's house on the shores of Lake Geneva that Swiss police have been forced to move in and shield the property. There has been a media scrum outside the home in Gland, with one Russian TV crew reportedly trying to broadcast live from outside the house.

So many journalists are camped outside Michael Schumacher's house on the shores of Lake Geneva that Swiss police have been forced to move in and shield the property . The family has its own private security teams who patrol the house 24-hours a day, but the police intervened when some journalists strayed on to the grounds in an attempt to catch a glimpse of the former Formula One ace. A Russian TV crew trying to broadcast live from the scene were told to move on, German newspaper Bild said. 'The police have told some journalists who were on the private property of Michael Schumacher to move in the public domain,' a spokesman for the Vaud police, Pierre-Olivier Gaudard, told reporters, according to the Telegraph.

In June this year Schumacher was moved from a hospital in Grenoble, where he had been cared for since the end of December following the accident, to the University Hospital in Lausanne. After eight weeks at the Lausanne facility, it was decided Schumacher would make the short 25-mile journey back to his house at Gland. Seven-times Formula One world champion Schumacher has not been home for almost nine months since embarking on a skiing holiday with his family in the French resort of Meribel. It was there the accident took place, with Schumacher hitting his head on a rock in a fall that resulted in him being placed in a medically-induced coma for a number of months due to the nature of his head injuries.

'Considering the severe injuries he suffered, progress has been made in the past weeks and months. 'There is still, however, a long and difficult road ahead.

"Father of two Glen Turner was shot a number of times at Croppa Creek on July 29 . The family of NSW environment officer Glen Turner who was gunned down in a remote country road have called for jail and confiscation of property in the worst cases where landowners ignore legislation. Ian Robert Turnbull, 79, has been charged with murdering the compliance officer at Croppa Creek, north of Moree, on July 29 this year. He is yet to plead and is currently in custody and is due to appear in court on September 22. Mr Turnball's NSW property had been at the centre of a land clearing dispute with the Office of Environment and Heritage over illegally chopping down trees in the Croppa Creek area.  He was previously charged and pleaded guilty in the Land and Environment Court with illegal land clearing between November 2011 and January 2012. Mr Turnbull, a wheat farmer, had previously been served notices by Mr Turner for illegally clearing vegetation on his property and in the Croppa Creek area. As part of the independent Biodiversity Legislation Review the Turner family have submitted an emotional submission calling for legislation to be less ambiguous and 'clear and concise disincentives' for landowners prepared to defy laws. The review is looking at legislative and policy framework for the management of native vegetation, threatened species and other protected native animals and plants in NSW. In their submission the family said: 'Our loss is at times unbearable, our need for quiet solace paramount. 'We ask the panel give serious consideration to increasing penalties for non-compliance, given that it has been clearly demonstrated that the current system of penalties does not act as a deterrent. 'Gaol terms should be a sentencing option. 'This legislation exists to place controls on those driven solely by self-interest and possessing a skewed idea of their rights as landholders to the detriment of the environment and other landholders. 'No landholder in Australia has an unfettered right to deal with their land as they will. 'We refer in particular to the possibility of landholders being granted permission to cause irreparable damage to land by means of broadscale land clearing, resulting in degradation of water quality, biodiversity, salinity, erosion and loss of our fragile topsoil.' Mr Turner was shot on a remote country road on a property north of Moree in NSW . In a tribute after his death the Turner family said: 'Glen was passionate about his job and made every effort to work positively and constructively with landholders. He was particularly keen that landholders understand their responsibilities under legislation such as the Native Vegetation Act, and was a strong advocate for improved clarity and better education of landholders. Ian Robert Turnbull, 79, has been charged with murdering the compliance officer at Croppa Creek, north of Moree, on July 29 this year . Mr Turner's family said at the time of his death they were devastated by his early passing and would remember him as a loving husband and father to his two young children, aged nine and 10. 'His passing comes at a time when his dreams of the farm and family, which he had planned and lovingly built together with Alison, were coming to fruition,' the statement said: . 'Glen was an accomplished pianist, a gourmet enthusiast and cook, and appreciated a fine wine. 'He always gravitated to the outdoor life and particularly loved taking his kids to the beach, whenever he returned to Port Macquarie - as well as enjoying his quiet time at home with the family and working together with Alison on their property.' The family said they were 'appalled' to find a bill put to Parliament on May 29 this year by the Shooters and Fishers Party proposing to reduce maximum penalties for offences including obstructing an authorised officer in the exercise of the officer’s investigative functions'. They have called for the review to look at a 'two pronged' approach to make the rules clearer for land owners. They want clearer laws on the responsibilities landowners have and 'concise disincentives' for landowners who break the laws. The Turners suggest in the worst cases custodial sentences and confiscation of property to be options for landowners who ignore follow-up directions and notices given by compliance officers. The independent review panel is expected to report to the government next month with the final reports due out in December. A spokesman for the Office of Environment and Heritage said: 'The independent Biodiversity Legislation Review Panel is now in the process of considering all submissions received.'","Glen Turner's family have filed an emotional submission to an independent review board looking into land clearing laws .

"Producers of a long-running stage musical have axed its Cliff Richard tribute segment in the wake of sex abuse allegations  against the star. The impersonator who portrays Sir Cliff, Trevor Payne, 68, who is also the show's director, has found himself out of a job because producers fear the star's fanatical fans would 'lynch' any audience member who complained about the section if it remained in the show. The popular rock n' roll show That'll Be The Day has featured a tribute act to Sir Cliff since it began its first run 29 years ago. Scroll down for video . Trevor Payne (pictured) a Cliff Richard impersonator, has been axed from a musical following historical sex abuse allegations against the star came to light last month . Last month Sir Cliff Richard furiously denied sexually assaulting a schoolboy at a Christian rally. His denial came as police raided his home over the allegation dating back almost three decades. The star said 'completely false' claims had been circulating on the internet for months but he had chosen not to 'dignify' them with a response. Detectives swooped on the singer's £3.1million apartment in Berkshire on August 13, spending five hours searching for evidence after receiving a report that a teenager under the age of 16 was attacked in Sheffield at an event held by American evangelist Billy Graham in 1985. Sir Cliff Richard (pictured left) and impersonator Trevor Payne (pictured right) performing on stage . Now, producers of the musical have decided to remove the six minute segment in the wake of the historical sex abuse allegations. They say they are worried that if they kept it in and a member of the audience publicly complained, Sir Cliff's fanatical followers would round on them and cause a public order outbreak. As a result Mr Payne has been 'inundated' with complaints from Cliff fans and was even accosted at the stage door of the Eastbourne Congress Theatre by an 'indignant' secretary of one Cliff Richard fan club. Trevor Payne (pictured right) performing as Sir Cliff with an Elvis impersonator as part of the musical . Mr Payne, 68, said he is 'very saddened' that the popular section has been axed. Sir Cliff (pictured) met officers from South Yorkshire Police last month but was not arrested or charged . He said: 'Cliff's fans are vehemently addicted and defensive of him and have been for many many years. 'We, like everyone else, were shocked when the allegations came to light and we hope that he is cleared of them. 'But we took the view that if I did venture on stage as Sir Cliff and just one member of the audience booed or made a remark then it wouldn't be a situation we could contain. 'We do get a lot of Cliff Richard fans attend our shows and they would probably turn on the person and we could have a terrible situation inside the theatre that would ruin the night. 'Put it this way, I asked one passionate Cliff fan how she would react if it happened and she replied ""I'd have their guts for garters"". 'We also took the view that because Sir Cliff himself has cancelled all his public engagements until further notice we would follow suit. 'We aren't judging him or condemning him. We all hope he is innocent. 'I have received lots of emails of complaint from our fans. One person sent me an email saying they had booked to see the show in Stevenege in October but they would not be coming since we took Cliff out of it. 'One lady, the secretary of a Cliff fan club, came to see me at the stage door in Eastbourne and was most indignant about it.' Mr Payne appeared as Cliff Richard in the music video for comedian Peter Kay's famous version of Amarillo in 2005 and his Channel 4 comedy show Max and Paddy's Road to Nowehere. ""When the news broke we decided to remove the section. 'It is very sad. I am a big fan of Cliff Richard and have met him and he is a charming man.' Sir Cliff reacted with fury  after learning that police searched his apartment in Sunningdale - while the BBC filmed live - when he had no prior notice. He was on holiday in Portugal at the time and returned to the UK ahead of his meeting with police. On August 23 the veteran star voluntarily met officers from South Yorkshire Police but was not arrested or charged, said his spokesman.

"A big drop in profits from products sold on the supermarket shelves is believed to be behind a decision by Coca Cola Amatil to cut employee wages by up to 38 per cent. Workers from the food and beverage giant are the latest victim in a vicious cost-cutting war being fought by retails desperate to secure market share in Australia's cut throat marketplace. Victorian warehouse workers are set to face a new pay structure which will see pay freezes in 2015 and new employees paid 38 percent less than their other colleagues for doing the same work. A big drop in profits from products sold on the supermarket shelves is believed to be behind a decision by Coca Cola Amatil to cut employee wages by up to 38 per cent. Existing employees will also have a pay freeze . Beverage giant, Coca Cola Amatil has penned a deal with it's Victorian workers which sees the implementation of a pay freeze, while new employees will have to work for 38% less. The company said the idea behind the pay review is to restore the business to a sustainable earnings growth. But analysts say the decision to freeze and slash wages can be attributed to the 'retail squeeze' which is happening across the industry. Following profit losses in 2013, Coca Cola Amatil reported a net profit after tax of $502.8 million but that was a decline of 9.6 per cent on 2012. It’s been put down to difficult trading conditions in the Australian grocery channel which saw a 9.3% decline in the Australian beverage earnings. ‘There’s a retail squeeze and it’s happening right now,’ said a spokesperson for the Australian food and grocery council. ‘There’s rising costs such as electricity and the Australian dollar but the retail end is not having much prices increases. The aggressive push for efficiencies are relentless and creating retail price wars.’ ‘All companies are going through this squeeze, making painful adjustments  to meet market dynamics. A clear impact on jobs in Australia, declining employment numbers and also companies looking to consolidate,’ he said. Victorian Workers from the food and beverage giant are the latest victim in a vicious cost-cutting war being fought by retails desperate to secure market share in Australia's cut throat marketplace . Much cheaper overseas : Like many manufacturing companies in Australia they send their operations overseas due to cheaper costs. The San Miguel beer bottling plant, rear view, Manila, Philippines(pictured) A Coca Cola Amatil spokesperson says its concentrating on a number of factors to better the company and its bottom line. 'Strengthening our brand portfolio; optimising revenue management; redesigning the route to market model to better cater to the needs of our customers and reducing the cost base to strengthen our competitive position,' they said. 'CCA has an existing EBA covering the Victorian warehouse which has recently been negotiated. This EBA was agreed to by the employees and approved by the Fair Work Commission.' 'These new rates are still above the relevant award. Existing employees under the agreement are not subject to these new rates.' But the company has said there are no immediate plans to freeze wages across CCA and all current employment arrangements with existing employees remain unchanged. Coca Cola Amatil Managing Director Terry Davis delivers the company's full year. They dipped 9.6% from 2012 to 2013 . ACTU president Ged Kearney believes we are seeing large employers quite emboldened by current government. 'Labour productivity is the strongest in years, but labour growth is low. Cost of living is going up and workers share of the pie keeps getting smaller,' she said. 'Large companies like Coke are putting the burden of their business onto workers.' Ms Kearney said members had major concerns about their living standards falling behind. 'Nobody wants to see their wages go backwards because you can't afford the ramifications. A job that doesn't help to have a dignified living is not a good job, she said. Blaming the labor government, Ms Kearney says a raft of legislation right across the board is swinging the power back to employers while workers are left to suffer with less security, pay and lower living standards. 'Research found the way to stimulate the economy is to raise wages, but the Abbott government is thumbing it's nose at that.' 'It's not fair. It does not make economic sense.' Director of National Workplace Relations at the Australian Industry group, Stephen Smith says there seems to be very modest outcomes across most sectors . 'Some enterprise agreements include lesser wages and conditions for new staff, to those enjoyed by current staff,' he said. The new changes provide a stark warning of the pressure on wages across the economy. 'This is a legitimate and sensible approach for companies to take where they have implemented generous wages and conditions in more prosperous times, but find that those wages and conditions are unsustainable for the future given the more difficult operating environment.' While the average wage in Australia is still growing, incomes aren't growing as fast as they were years ago, according to economists. 'Consumers are more conservative, we've got relatively high currency depressing our export rates, with a soft labour market rising the unemployment market,' said Westpac senior economist Justin Smirk. 'We've come through a period of strong income growth particularly from 2004 to 2008 and we've come through realistically fairly strong in terms of income in the last decade.' 'Income growth is likely to be slower and will continue for a number of years,' he said. Mr Smirk said GDP(gross domestic product) is linked and circular. workers in a Coca Cola bottling factory. The beverage giant has penned a deal with it's Victorian workers which sees the implementation of a pay freeze, while new employees will have to work for 38% less. 'Research found the way to stimulate the economy is to raise wages, but the Abbott government is thumbing it's nose at that.' ACTU president Ged Kearney feels the new pay structure is unfair . 'The better productivity we have the faster GDP growth and the faster income growth,' he said. 'On average some industries grow stronger, other sectors are lagging behind such as manufacturing and tourism services which are under pressure from the Australian dollar but it's mixed across all industries.' Daily Mail Australia called the United Voice Union, who represent some members at Coke's Victorian warehouse, but they declined to comment on the issue. But Coke are not the only ones to drop their wage increases and implement pay freezes. Car Manufacturer Holden in Adelaide pressured its workers to accept a wages freeze last year, in a bid to keep the company manufacturing in Australia. Kellogg's was also criticised after it tried to persuade workers to open up their workforce agreement to allow reduced wages and conditions to be implemented.

"They say they have the best (or, breast) of intentions. The director of a Gold Coast clinic which is today performing a record 23 boob jobs has defended its 'Super Friday' stunt, after it copped criticism from local doctors who were concerned it trivialised medical procedures. Christyna Kruczaj, the director of the CosMediTours clinic at Surfer's Paradise, told Daily Mail Australia the clinic was not like a production line. Discounted boob jobs will be offered on the Gold Coast to compete against patients heading to Asia . 'It's very far from a factory line,' Ms Kruszaj said. 'Because of the numbers people are obviously tagging it as something demonic or something.' 'It's not a factory line, it's based on surgeons per theatre and when it's feasible for them to do so.' Ms Kruczaj told Daily Mail Australia the record breaking breast augmentation attempt was being held to shine a spotlight on the Gold Coast as a destination for medical tourism. Christyna Kruczaj (pictured right) is the the director of the CosMediTours based on the Gold Coast . In recent times, thousands of Australian women have flocked to Thailand in for cut-price cosmetic surgery packages each year. Dr Shaun Rudd, from the Australian Medical Association's Queensland branch, told local newspaper the Gold Coast Bulletin he could not support the event. 'Quality and safety are very important aspects of any work we do and to somehow trivialise these procedures doesn't sound like an appropriate thing to do,' Dr Rudd was quoted saying. Gold Coast girls Natalie Kernke, Anna Thomsen and Noi Aasen all travelled to Thailand to get their boob jobs through CosMediTour . 'Surgery is not something that should be taken lightly.' Operations at the clinic are run by qualified plastic surgeons and Ms Kruszaj said today's program was well-structured and in line with medical safety regulations. She said self image is the main reason why her clients choose to get breast implants. 'Self image is the number one factor, absolutely.' The surgery in Queensland's Broadbeach is teaming up with plastic surgeons to offer cheap procedures . 'Everyone wants to look nice, whether they want to have big beautiful breasts or whatever that may be,' she said. 'It's a personal choice.' The clinic has received many customers from the Gold Coast as well as clients from as far away as Western Australia, South Australia, the Northern Territory and Victoria. Ms Kruszaj said she had received support from the local community about her attempts to muscle in on the medical tourism market. 'The Gold Coast must be open to all kinds of tourism', she said, whether that be whale-watching for plastic surgery. She said 'time will tell' whether the clinic will attempt to break today's record.","Cosmetic surgery clinic will perform a record 23 breast ops in 24 hours .

"A Utah elementary school teacher who was carrying a concealed firearm at school accidentally shot herself in the leg when the weapon discharged in a faculty bathroom shortly before classes started Thursday morning, officials said. The teacher at Westbrook Elementary School, in the Salt Lake City suburb of Taylorsville, was severely injured when the bullet entered and exited her leg, and she was rushed to a hospital, Granite School District spokesman Ben Horsley said. She was in good condition and alert at the hospital by midmorning, Horsley said. No other faculty or students witnessed the shooting, but they might have heard the gunshot or seen the teacher as she was taken out of the school to the hospital, he said. A teacher at Westbrook Elementary School was carrying a concealed firearm at school when she accidentally shot herself in the leg when the weapon discharged in a faculty bathroom . Wound: The bullet reportedly entered and exited the teacher's leg . Classes were continuing as usual, and crisis counselors were available, Horsley said. Officials were still investigating how the gun discharged. 'This just appears at this point in time to be an accident,' he said. He wouldn't release details about the woman or what she taught, but he noted she was carrying the weapon legally with a concealed-firearm permit. Utah is among the few states that allow people with concealed-weapons permits to carry guns in public schools, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Teachers are not required to disclose that they are carrying a weapon, and administrators are prohibited from asking. Educators have said they have no way of determining how many Utah teachers are armed, but gun-rights advocates have estimated that 1 percent, or about 240 teachers in the state, are licensed to carry weapons. A spokesman said the teacher was in good condition and alert at the hospital by midmorning . Under Utah law, teachers and staff without a concealed-carry permit can still bring a gun to school if an administrator approves, if they happen to live on school property, or if they work in law enforcement. The Granite School District requires teachers who carry guns at school to keep the weapons with them at all times, including inside a bathroom stall, Horsley said. Some people are surprised to learn about Utah's law and ask why teachers are allowed to have guns, he said. 'That's frankly not a question we can answer,' Horsley said. 'That is a question for the state legislature.' 'This is exactly what we are working against,' said Miriam Walkingshaw, co-founder of Utah Parents Against Gun Violence, which is opposed to guns in schools. The risk of having any guns near children is greater than any risk teachers hope to prevent, she said. The lack of disclosure about which teachers are carrying guns is a problem, Walkingshaw said. 'I feel like I should have a right to know whether my child's teacher is carrying a gun,' she said. Gun-rights advocates say teachers can act faster than law enforcement in the first few minutes of any attack at a school. The Utah Shooting Sports Council, the state's biggest gun lobby, has offered free basic gun training classes to teachers. 'We trust our kids with teachers every day,' Clark Aposhian, chairman of the Utah Shooting Sports Council, told The Associated Press in March 2013. 'Why do we think they'll be any danger?' Aposhian did not return messages Thursday seeking comment.","Officials say a Utah teacher is in good condition after accidentally shooting herself in the leg with a concealed firearm in a faculty bathroom .

"A-six-year old boy said 'I have done something bad' after he accidentally started a fire with a lighter that killed two teenage sweethearts and a three-year-old. Rosie Benellick, 17, her boyfriend Andrew Gunn, 18, and her little brother Harvey, all died after the fire in Honiton, Devon, on April 4 last year. An inquest into their deaths was today told the fire had been started by a young boy, who can not be named for legal reasons, who had alerted Rosie and Harvey's mother, Mizelley Bennellick, 32, to the blaze. Tragedy: Rosie Benellick, 17, (left) her boyfriend Andrew Gunn, 18, (right) and her little brother Harvey, all died after a fire was accidentally started by a six-year-old with a lighter, an inquest heard . Toddler: Three-year-old Harvey Bennellick also died in the fire at his home in Honiton, Devon . Mrs Bennellick said in a statement read to the hearing at Exeter's County Hall that the child had gone into the room where she and husband Sean were sleeping, and told her: 'I have done something bad'. 'I said ""what have you done?"",' she said. 'He said ""there is a fire"".' Mrs Bennellick and three children fled the four bedroomed council house, while Mr Bennellick tried to rescue the two teenagers and toddler who were still in their upstairs bedroom. He was beaten back by the intense heat as emergency crews arrived at the house and pulled them from the flames. Mrs Bennellick, who was outside, said: 'I was screaming, panicking, I was screaming Rosie’s name. They were still in the property.' Home: Rosie's father Sean had tried to free the teenagers and Harvey from the four-bedroom house . Tributes: Flowers left in memory of Rosie, Andrew and Harvey at the house after the blaze . She told neighbour Carol Ings that her 'babies' were still in the house, and relayed to Detective Constable Clare Ware, who was sent to the scene, what had happened. 'Child D came downstairs and said he had done a really naughty thing,' Mrs Bennellick said in the statement. 'He said I was playing with a lighter and started a fire. It all felt like a bad dream. 'It is a devastating tragedy for our family, almost impossible to recover from our loses in the fire.' Rosie, hotel worker Andrew, and Harvey were all airlifted to hospital but the couple died in Exeter the day after the fire, and Harvey the following day at a Bristol hospital. All three died from ‘inhalation asphyxia’, the inquest was told, and suffered brain injuries from breathing in carbon monoxide and cyanide fumes. Their organs were donated for transplant. Devon coroner, Dr Elizabeth Earland, said it was a ‘tragic case’ and she imposed a reporting restriction on the three children who survived the blaze - a seven year old girl and boys aged six and five. The inquest at Exeter’s County Hall heard that Mr Bennellick and teenagers Rosie and Andrew all smoked roll up cigarettes and used disposable lighters. Mrs Bennellick, who had been due to attend the inquest but had instead been admitted to hospital, said in her statement that the family had strict rules about smoking which included smoking outside or in the kitchen and ‘not to leave lighters lying around’. The inquest that a year earlier Child D had been caught setting fire to some paper in a garden. The family said they had three smoke alarms fitted in the house, managed by East Devon Council, but a week before the blaze they all became faulty. Mr Bennellick, 36, said in his statement Andy and Rosie kept their tobacco and lighters in their bedroom but he had warned them to be careful about younger children picking them up. He said Rosie had taken the faulty smoke alarms to pieces and left them in a kitchen drawer because they were ‘going off for no reason’ and waking up the younger children at night. Couple: Rosie and Andrew were both airlifted to hospital in Exeter, but died the following day . He said he had heard Child D say 'I have done something bad', before he ran out, and his wife told him something was happening upstairs. 'I tried to go forwards, it was so, so hot and realised there was a fire upstairs,' he said. 'The heat was unbearable.' He said that all the upstairs bedroom windows were shut and he was unable to break them. 'I thought they are burning to death,' he said. 'It was impossible to get through. I could not see anything upstairs, I could not even see the door to the bedroom.' Mr Bennellick said he had been scared to ask his wife later told him that Child D seemed to have started the fire in a bedroom, but said he was ‘scared to ask him direct questions’ in case the child thought he was angry with him. Neighbour Carol Ings said she took the three surviving children into her house said Child D was a ‘scared little boy’ who looked like a ‘rabbit in headlights’. The inquest was played video recordings of police interviews with a seven-year-old girl and the six-year-old boy following the fire. The girl said the first time she became aware of the blaze was when the boy told Mr and Mrs Bennellick what was going on. 'He said ""someone has been messing with fire and there's fire upstairs"",' the girl told police. '(The boy) was the first one to know about the fire and he got really hot in his cheeks.' During his interview with police, the boy said he had been playing on a PlayStation in a bedroom when it became hot. 'There was a lighter on the side where the PlayStation was,' he said. 'The PlayStation knocked it off. 'Then the telly fell off and switched it on. Then it started setting a sheet on fire and a bed on fire.' When asked if the boy knew how to operate the lighter, which he described as orange, he replied: 'There's a little switch on the back of it. Sean Bennellick, 36, said Andy and Rosie kept their tobacco and lighters in their bedroom but he had warned them to be careful about younger children picking them up . 'The telly fell on the switch and then set the bed on fire.' The boy said he had to jump over fire to escape and went to alert others in the house but 'forgot' to alert Harvey,  Rosie and Andy. Paramedic Duncan Pearce said Child D was unhurt and said he made a 'random comment' of 'is little Harvey going to die?' Mr Pearce said of Mrs Bennellick: 'She was so calm, it was difficult to believe she was the mum.' He added that her husband  was 'emotional and crying'. Fire group manager Christopher Blackburn said the smoke alarms had been taken down saying Mr Bennellick had said a week before they had started sounding for no reason and Rosie had taken them apart and removed the batteries. He said the fire started in a first floor back bedroom. He said: 'It is my conclusion two fires were started (in a) bedroom using a cigarette lighter. The person who lit those fires left the room and shut the door behind them.' He said if the smoke and heat detectors had been working it would have been 'exceptionally likely all the occupants would have been alerted at a very early stage' and would have had 'adequate time to escape'. The fire chief said a fire was started under a folding bed in the bedroom and also in a chest of drawers where two books were found to have been burned, possibly at a different time. One of the books was a Horrid Henry book, he said. The Greater Devon coroner Dr Elizabeth Earland concluded that Rosie, Andrew and Harvey died after a fire which was accidental but contributed to by 'neglect'. She said: 'I consider there is insufficient evidence to say that the fire which killed the three was started deliberately. 'I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the fire was caused by an accidental ignition of material by the fold up bed in bedroom A in the early hours of April 5, 2013. 'I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the smoke detectors fitted at the property had been intentionally disabled as an unintentional but foreseeable consequence.' 'All three died as a consequence of these circumstances.' She said that the tragedy should serve as a warning to people who have smoking materials in their homes where there are young children, but did not consider that the criteria for gross negligence had been met. She recorded a conclusion of accidental death contributed to by neglect for Rosie, Harvey and Mr Gunn. 'I am prevented from naming individuals, I am also prevented from attributing liability,' she went on. 'Nevertheless, there remains serious concerns that the careless use of smoking materials presents significant dangers within the home. 'Those tasked with looking after young children should be aware of what can happen and take steps to prevent fires from breaking out,' she said. Dr Earland offered her condolences to the Bennellick family, who did not attend the inquest, and Mr Gunn's parents, who did. 'We hope that in time they might come to terms with the dreadful tragedy,' she said.","Rosie Benellick, 17, boyfriend Andrew Gunn, 18, and brother Harvey, 3, died .

"A pet food company has become the first in the world to introduce traffic light labels on its packaging in a bid to stop pet obesity. Tribal Pet Foods, based in London, is incorporating the warning system on the front of their packaging, which outlines the fat and fibre content of the food as well as the calories. It comes after a study earlier this year revealed that there are around 2.5 million dogs in Britain that are classed as overweight, with some owners even feeding their pets fast food, leftovers, crisps, chocolate and chips. The new traffic light style labelling, which is being added to pet food made by the company Tribal Pet Foods, in a bid to help stop pet obesity . The traffic light labelling that is used on human food, which shows the fat, calorie, sat and sugar content of the product . The traffic light warnings uses the colours red, amber and green to show how healthy the food is for the dog. Red indicates that the food is bad for dogs, amber that it is slightly above or below the ideal range, while green indicates it contains the ideal range of nutrients. The labels mirror the warnings that are already featured on human food, which shows how much fat, saturated fat, salt, sugar and calories it contains. All major supermarkets are signed up to the scheme and along with various well-known manufacturers. A spokesman for Tribal Pet Food said: 'Pet food labelling can often be complex, and it's not always easy to know which choice is best for your dog.

'That's what why Tribal Pet Foods have become the first pet food company in the world to introduce a comprehensive traffic light label on each pack, just as we have for our own food.' According to the PDSA, there are more than 10 million pets who regularly receive fatty treats, due to owners sharing their own unhealthy eating habits in a well-intentioned but misguided attempt to make them happy.

"A scientist at Nasa has converted data from the sun into sounds in a process called ‘sonification’. In a video they use data from Nasa’s Wind spacecraft to 'listen' to the solar magnetic field. As the solar wind changes in intensity, a shockwave can be heard passing over the spacecraft. A scientist at the University of Michigan has carried out 'sonification'. This involved turning spacecraft data into audible sounds (illustration shown). This resulted in short clips that revealed shock waves passing over the satellite. The data was gathered by Nasa's Wind satellite in 2007 . Robert Alexander, a PhD candidate in design science at the University of Michigan, performed the process. He is also a sonification specialist who trains heliophysicists at Nasa’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. ‘Sonification offers a promising supplement to standard visual analysis techniques,’ he said. The Wind satellite, which is in orbit around the sun, records electromagnetic fluctuations that can be converted directly to audio samples. Alexander and his team used custom written computer algorithms to convert those electromagnetic frequencies into sounds. The result is that when a fast stream of plasma - super hot, charged gas that fills space - passes the spacecraft, it creates a noticeable effect. Converting data from the Wind spacecraft into audio reveals an audible shock wave. The Wind satellite (right), which launched in 1994 and is still active today, is used to study radio and plasma that occur in the solar wind from the sun (left) before it reaches Earth. The Wind spacecraft has enough fuel to last in solar orbit for 60 years, during which time it could continue to gather useful data . In one example, Alexander's team analysed data points from the Wind satellite from November 2007, condensing three hours of real-time recording to a three second audio clip. While this 'sonification' process related to an event in 2007, a powerful solar flare blasting its way towards Earth could wreak havoc with communications and power systems in the coming days. Scientists have warned that the 'extreme' solar storm could affect power grids, satellites and radio transmissions when the flare arrives at the Earth's surface. But they said they are not 'scared of this one', as the worst of its power looks like it will miss the planet and not cause many problems. It should, however, lead to stunning auroras extending out from Earth's poles. To an untrained ear, the data sounds like a microphone recording on a windy day. When Alexander presented these sounds to a researcher, however, they could identify a distinct chirping at the beginning of the audio clip followed by a percussive event, culminating in a loud boom. Alexander translates the data into audio files through a process known as audification, a specific type of sonification that involves directly listening to raw, unedited satellite data. Translating this data into audio can be likened to part of the process of collecting sound from a person singing into a microphone at a recording studio with reel-to-reel tape. When a person sings into a microphone, it detects changes in pressure and converts the pressure signals to changes in magnetic intensity in the form of an electrical signal. The clips have three distinct sections, including a warble noise leading up to a short knock at slightly higher frequency followed by a quieter segment containing broadband noise that is both rising and hissing. The sound of a shock passing over the spacecraft can also be heard . The electrical signals are stored on the reel tape. Magnetometers on the Wind satellite measure changes in magnetic field directly creating a similar kind of electrical signal. Alexander writes a computer program to translate this data to an audio file. 'The tones come out of the data naturally,' he said. 'If there is a frequency embedded in the data, then that frequency becomes audible as a sound.' Listening to data in this way has been done before. In a study in 1982, researchers used audification to identify micrometeroids, or small ring particles, hitting the Voyager 2 spacecraft as it traversed Saturn's rings. The impacts were visually obscured in the data but could be easily heard - sounding like intense impulses, almost like a hailstorm. However, the method is not often used in the science community because it requires a certain level of familiarity with the sounds. For instance, the listener needs to have an understanding of what typical solar wind turbulence sounds like in order to identify atypical events. 'It's about using your ear to pick out subtle differences,' Alexander said.","A scientist at the University of Michigan has carried out 'sonification'

"Witnesses have spoken of their horror after a toddler was fatally run down in a supermarket car park in front of her distraught mother. An eyewitness to the tragic incident said the woman screamed 'someone help my daughter', after the two-year-old girl was hit by a car outside the Asda store in Wembley, north west London. A large crowd gathered to try and help last night as paramedics were called. Despite their efforts, the young girl died later in hospital. The female driver of the car was not arrested. However, police are appealing for witnesses. Distressting: A large crowd gathered outside the Asda supermarket last night in Wembley, north west London, after a two-year-old girl was fatally hit by a car in the car park in front of her mother . The tragic incident happened at 8.30pm yesterday and involved a black Volkswagen Estate. Witnesses said the child was killed near the zebra crossing in front of the store. Local . resident Bill Richardson, 26, said: 'Just before 9pm I had gone . to Asda to get some petrol, when I noticed a large crowd of about 40 . people gathered near the main entrance. 'I could hear a woman desperately screaming ""my daughter, my daughter, somebody please help my daughter"". 'I . went closer to see what was happening and could see a woman aged in her . mid-20s wearing jeans and a white t-shirt covered in blood. 'When I got closer I could see a small child lying on a the floor - she was not moving. 'One of the onlookers then put his jacket over her . to keep her warm, but the mum would not stop screaming.' Mr Richardson said a man in his early 20s then ran into the crowd and it appeared an argument, then a physical fight, broke out between him and another man. Horror: Police closed the supermarket near Wembley Stadium, pictured, while they investigated the death . 'As I left the petrol . station I could hear sirens and then saw two ambulances, two police . cars, two police vans pull into Asda,' Mr Richardson said. 'It was all very frantic.' Another witness said: 'I saw the paramedics attending the small child, who was lying on the ground wrapped in blankets. 'Her mother was hysterical and crying. The father had to be calmed by police. 'The crowd was dead silent. Everyone was in shock. It was horrible seeing the little girl lying on the floor under blankets.' 'The crowd was dead silent. Everyone was in shock.

A . police car blocked the entrance to the car park until midnight and the store was closed while police carried out their . investigations. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'Officers are appealing for witnesses to a road traffic collision in which a two-year-old girl died. 'Police were called at 8:34pm to Asda car park, Forty Lane, Wembley, to reports of a collision between a car and a child. 'London . Ambulance Service was called to the scene. The girl, aged two, was treated at the scene. She was then taken to a north west London . hospital where she subsequently died. 'No arrests have been made. We will name her when all the next of kin have been informed.' In . a statement, Asda offered its condolences to the girl’s family. Spokeswoman Lauren Pell said: 'Our thoughts are with the families at . this time and we’d like them to know we’re here for them if they need . us.' A post-mortem examination will be arranged in due course.

Beverage giant, Coca Cola Amatil has penned a deal with it's Victorian workers which sees the implementation of a pay freeze, while new employees will have to work for 38% less. 'Part of our strategic review we have announced four imperatives - strengthening our brand portfolio; optimising revenue management; redesigning the route to market model to better cater to the needs of our customers and reducing the cost base to strengthen our competitive position,' said the spokesperson. 'CCA has an existing EBA covering the Victorian warehouse which has recently been negotiated. This EBA was agreed to by the employees and approved by the Fair Work Commission.' 'These new rates are still above the relevant award. Existing employees under the agreement are not subject to these new rates.' But the company has said there are no immediate plans to freeze wages across CCA and all current employment arrangements with existing employees remain unchanged. ACTU president Ged Kearney believes we are seeing large employers quite emboldened by current government. 'Labour productivity is the strongest in years, but labour growth is low. Cost of living is going up and workers share of the pie keeps getting smaller,' she said. 'Large companies like Coke are putting the burden of their business onto workers.' Ms Kearney said members had major concerns about their living standards falling behind. 'Nobody wants to see their wages go backwards because you can't afford the ramifications. A job that doesn't help to have a dignified living is not a good job, she said. Blaming the labor government, Ms Kearney says a raft of legislation right across the board is swinging the power back to employers while workers are left to suffer with less security, pay and lower living standards. 'Research found the way to stimulate the economy is to raise wages, but the Abbott government is thumbing it's nose at that.' 'It's not fair. It does not make economic sense.' A two tiered pay system is set to come into play for workers at Coca Cola Amatil's Victorian warehouses, which will see them locked into a pay freeze in 2015 . Much cheaper overseas : Like many manufacturing companies in Australia they send their operations overseas due to cheaper costs. The San Miguel beer bottling plant, rear view, Manila, Philippines(pictured) Director of National Workplace Relations at the Australian Industry group, Stephen Smith says there seems to be very modest outcomes across most sectors . 'Some enterprise agreements include lesser wages and conditions for new staff, to those enjoyed by current staff,' he said. Coca Cola Amatil Managing Director  Terry Davis delivers the company's full year results in Sydney, in February . 'This is a legitimate and sensible approach for companies to take where they have implemented generous wages and conditions in more prosperous times, but find that those wages and conditions are unsustainable for the future given the more difficult operating environment.' The new changes provide a stark warning of the pressure on wages across the economy. While the average wage in Australia is still growing, incomes aren't growing as fast as they were years ago, according to economists. 'Consumers are more conservative, we've got relatively high currency depressing our export rates, with a soft labour market rising the unemployment market,' said Westpac senior economist Justin Smirk. 'We've come through a period of strong income growth particularly from 2004 to 2008 and we've come through realistically fairly strong in terms of income in the last decade.' 'Income growth is likely to be slower and will continue for a number of years,' he said. Mr Smirk said GDP(gross domestic product) is linked and circular. workers in a Coca Cola bottling factory. The beverage giant has penned a deal with it's Victorian workers which sees the implementation of a pay freeze, while new employees will have to work for 38% less. 'Research found the way to stimulate the economy is to raise wages, but the Abbott government is thumbing it's nose at that.' ACTU president Ged Kearney feels the new pay structure is unfair . 'The better productivity we have the faster GDP growth and the faster income growth,' he said. 'On average some industries grow stronger, other sectors are lagging behind such as manufacturing and tourism services which are under pressure from the Australian dollar but it's mixed across all industries.' Daily Mail Australia called the United Voice Union, who represent some members at Coke's Victorian warehouse, but they declined to comment on the issue. But Coke are not the only ones to drop their wage increases and implement pay freezes. Car Manufacturer Holden in Adelaide pressured its workers to accept a wages freeze last year, in a bid to keep the company manufacturing in Australia. Kellogg's was also criticised after it tried to persuade workers to open up their workforce agreement to allow reduced wages and conditions to be implemented.

"For the past 14 years, Coleen Nolan has been one of more the opinionated and outgoing women on the Loose Women panel. But the TV star has now revealed that in the last few months, her struggles to cope with her sister Bernie Nolan's death from breast cancer left her in a downward spiral and even bedridden. Bernie passed away in July 2013, and for the first nine months Coleen managed to carry on despite her grief. Coleen Nolan on the This Morning sofa with Denise Robertson today . But the former singer has now revealed that turning 49 in March left her eventually unable to control her emotions any longer. She said: 'Bernie's death took a year to sink in - it took me a year before I truly accepted the fact she was gone. 'The first year you're just wrapped up in the bubble and everyone's still around you. 'Then, in March of this year I turned 49, which was the age Bernie was when she found out she had breast cancer and then of course she died three years on. 'I started to get paranoid and anxious about everything - I stayed in bed at night planning my funeral and every ache and pain I got, I thought I had cancer.' The roller coaster of emotions only got worse when July arrived - the first anniversary of Bernie's death. Coleen pictured with  This Morning's Denise Robertson opened up about her struggles after sister Bernie's death . Coleen told This Morning: 'In July there was the anniversary of her death and it just hit me like a ton of bricks. 'I missed her every day. 'But actually it was Bernie that got me through it though, because when I got to the point where I felt like I needed to get a grip or I wouldn't get out of bed, I could literally hear Bernie in my head shouting in my ear, ""Coleen get out of bed!""' Since Bernie's death has been that Coleen and her sisters have now managed to heal their family rift. She said: 'Everything's back as normal now, which is the only good thing to come out of it. 'It's puts everything into perspective and makes you think life is too short.' Coleen believes it has also made her see her relationship with husband Ray Fensome in a different light. She said: 'I don't want to say that me and Ray have been blissfully happy for the last fourteen years because it's not true, we've had terrible times, but - touch wood - we've come through them. 'It works both ways (when it comes to relationship trouble), some people give up on the first hurdle and others don't think they ever should give up. Bernie Nolan (left) in her role in police drama The Bill. After she became sick, the actress proudly displayed the results of her chemotherapy after undergoing treatment in 2010 (right) 'But I think since Bernie's death - Me and Ray work hard at our marriage, however - if I ever get to a point where it's just not working, I will walk away because I think we both deserve to be happy.' One element very much beyond Coleen's control is impending adulthood of her youngest child, Ciara. In five years, all of her three children; Shane Ritchie Jr, 26, Jake Roche, 21, and Ciara, 13, will have reached the age of eighteen and it is something that fills her with terror. She said: '(My eldest) Shane's 26 this year -so for 26 years, everything I have done is for them (my children). 'Part of me feels like I've done a good job, so I should pat myself on the back, but another part of me feels like I don't know what to do now.' Jake - the youngest of Coleen's two sons with Shane Ritchie - doesn't have any troubles of his own in deciding what he should be doing over the next few years. His band Rixton has been signed by Justin Bieber's manager Scooter Braun and their single Me and My Broken Heart has already hit No.1 in the UK. Coleen said: 'He's never at home, he has just got back home from Shanghai. 'I keep texting him things like, 'I hope you're eating properly, don't do drugs,' and he screen-shots the messages and puts them on Twitter. 'I'm not worried though, he has been around (showbiz) his whole life, so I'd knock him across the room if he ever threw any kind of diva strop.'","Coleen suddenly had difficulty coping on the anniversary of Bernie's death .

"Prosecutors seeking to increase the bail amount for a retired Wisconsin cop accused of murdering his wife and her sister asserted the ALS sufferer plotted the murder for days. Former Dane County sheriffs deputy Andrew Steele, 39, not only gunned down wife Ashlee and sister-in-law Kacee Tollesbol on August 22, but he went to great pains to ensure it was just the three of them home that day. The judge agreed that the accusations warranted a higher bail and agreed to increase it from $1million to $2million Thursday, just as Steele pleaded not guilty to two-counts of first degree homicide. In cold blood? Andrew Steele appeared stoic in a Wisconsin courtroom Thursday, where his bail was increased from $1million to $2million after prosecutors argued he'd planned the murder of his wife and sister-in-law days in advance . However, the Wisconsin State Journal reports that Judge Nicholas McNamara did not rule on whether Steele could visit his children aged 10 and 13. Prosecutors on Friday charged a former Wisconsin sheriff's deputy suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease with shooting his wife and sister-in-law to death earlier this month. Accused: ex-Dane County sheriff's deputy Andrew Steele, pictured, has been charged with killing his wife and the woman's sister . The killings came just days after the victims and the suspect's friends took part in the ALS ice bucket challenge, raising $23,000 towards the ailing deputy's medical expenses. Former Dane County Sheriff's Deputy Andrew Steele, 39, faces two counts of first-degree intentional homicide in the death of his wife, Ashlee Steele, and his sister-in-law, Kacee Tollefsbol, of Lake Elmo, Minnesota. He would get two mandatory life sentences if he is convicted. A judge on Thursday ordered a former Wisconsin sheriff's deputy to stand trial in the shooting deaths of his wife and sister-in-law. Police found the bodies of Andrew Steele's wife, Ashlee Steele, and his sister-in-law, Kacee Tollefsbol, at the Steeles' home in Fitchburg, a Madison suburb, on August 22. Tollefsbol told police before she died that her brother-in-law had shot her, according to court documents. Prosecutors charged Andrew Steele last week with two counts of first-degree intentional homicide. 'A reasonable person would conclude a crime was committed and the defendant committed it,' Dane County Circuit Judge Steven Ebert said at a brief preliminary hearing Thursday. The only witness who testified was Matthew Wiza, a Fitchburg detective who was the first officer to reach the Steele home. Tragic sisters: This undated photo provided by Rachelle Putnam shows Ashlee Steele, left, and her sister, Kacee Tollefsbol, both were found dead of gunshot wounds at Steele's home in Fitchburg, Wisconsin . He told Assistant District Attorney Andrea Raymond that when he responded to a call of a gunshot victim in the Steele's basement shortly before 1pm, he found a haze of smoke in the backyard and blood on the patio. He said he heard a woman crying out that she was dying and found Tollefsbol, 38, covered in blood in a basement rec room. He immediately asked her who had shot her and she said it was her brother-in-law. She was unable to answer any further questions, Wiza said, because 'her health was declining.' He later learned that she had been shot in the torso, he said. Court documents indicate Tollefsbol had called 911 and told a dispatcher that her brother-in-law had shot her. Supporters: Andrew Steele's law enforcement colleagues have made videos showing them taking the ice bucket challenge in his honor . No good deed: Ashlee Steele spearheaded the effort to raise money for her husband dubbed 'Tough as Steele', posting videos of the ice bucket challenges on her Facebook account . Financial success: Mrs Steele and the deputy's friends were able to collect more than $20,000 towards his care through the ALS initiative . Wiza said he later learned that a SWAT team discovered Ashlee Steele, 39, shot in the head in the master bedroom and found Andrew Steele sitting in a laundry room with a pistol. The former deputy had started the dryer and vented it back into the room and he had set up a grill loaded with hot charcoal in the room. Andrew Steele, 39, looked on silently from the defense table, his ankles and hands shackled, as defense attorney Jessa Nicholson asked Wiza whether he saw any signs of a struggle in the house. He said he couldn't answer that because he was inside for only about four minutes before he carried Tollefsbol out to a waiting firefighter. The motive for the slayings remains a mystery. Court documents are silent on the subject and Nicholson told reporters after the hearing that no motive has emerged. Steele resigned from the Dane County Sheriff's Department in June after he was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, better known as ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease, which attacks nerve cells and can lead to paralysis and death. The average life expectancy is two to five years after diagnosis. Nicholson said she plans to explore the effect the disease has had on Steele. According to the ALS Association, sufferers can sometimes experience problems with thinking and behavior. She said she would also determine whether Tollefsbol actually implicated him. Ashlee Steele was leading a fundraising drive for her husband when she was killed. Steele was ordered held on $1million bail and barred from contacting his family . Accused: Andrew Steele is wheeled out of his home in a stretcher Friday after allegedly murdering his wife and her sister . Family: The couple had two children, and had been together for 26 years. Police have not released a motive . Tragic: Sisters Ashlee Steele, left, and Kacee M. Tollefsbol, right, were shot dead on Friday, leaving six children behind between them .

"When Carol Jumper was diagnosed with cancer last month, she broke the news to her employer - but instead of sympathy and support she received a letter announcing her immediate termination. The handwritten note from Pennsylvania oral surgeon Dr George Visnich to his long-time employee, 51-year-old Ms Jumper, of Hopewell, sparked a firestorm this week after it was shared on social media. The letter, written on Visnich's office stationary and dated August 11, opened with the line: 'You are currently engaged in a battle against cancer that will be demanding physically, mentally, and emotionally.’ Unceremoniously dismissed: Carol Jumper, 51, received this note from her employer, Dr George Visnich, telling her that she was being let go because of her cancer diagnosis . Dr Visnich then explained to Ms Jumper that her symptoms, medications and side effects of chemotherapy will distract her from functioning in his office 'at the level required.' 'Because of this, I am laying you off without pay as of August 11, 2014,' the dental specialist concluded. Office veteran: Jumper has worked for Visnich for more than 12 years, until last month when she learned that she was suffering from a cancer impacting her liver, ovaries and pancreas . He closed the termination letter with the words: 'Our thoughts and prayers are with you as you fight this horrible disease... I hope your battle is swift, smooth and successful!!' Dennis Smerigan, Carol Jumper's fiance, told the Beaver Countian that she is suffering from a cancer that affects her pancreas, liver, and ovaries. She was diagnosed with the potentially deadly illness last month after going to a doctor complaining of stomach pains. Jumper has worked for Visnich for more than 12 years, but you wouldn't know it from the apparent lack of sympathy he has shown the woman in her hour of need, according to Smerigan . 'He didn't even call her, he hasn't called her once since she got sick,' the fiance told the paper. But according to the lawyer hired by the oral surgeon, it was all a big misunderstanding caused by what was intended as an act of kindness on Visnich’s part. Attorney Larry Kelly told the Beaver County Times Visnich laid off Jumper so she could collect unemployment benefits while undergoing cancer treatment, ‘with the understanding that when she is feeling better, she can come back to work.’ The lawyer said his client has found the public outcry over his letter 'very troubling' because he was being vilified for trying to perform a 'humanitarian' act. Jumper's friend John Barkovich told the Times that she now wants to put the entire episode behind her and focus on the fight for her life. Jumper's supporters have created a Facebook group called Bumper's Buddies to help raise money for her medical expenses by selling T-shirts and hosting charity events. Big misunderstanding: A lawyer representing Visnich, who owns this practice in Aliquippa, Pennsylvania, insisted that the doctor temporarily laid off Jumper so she could collect unemployment benefits .","Carol Jumper, 51, from Pennsylvania, suffers from cancer that impacts her pancreas, liver and ovaries .

"As London Fashion Week arrives in the capital tomorrow one doctor is asking fashion fans to consider the impact their wardrobe choices may be having upon their health. Mr Simon Moyes, a London-based surgeon who specialises in arthroscopic surgery for knee, shoulder, foot and ankle problems, is more used to dealing with aches and pains of professional athletes. But his city clinics have recently seen a rise in clients complaining of injuries caused by their accessories. Heavy bags, necklaces and heels like those on Lydia Bright and Ashley Roberts could cause health probelms . 'My colleagues and I, within the physiotherapy and personal fitness training arenas, have seen on average about a 20 per cent increase in neck and shoulder problems,' says Mr Moyes. 'This problem has started to emerge, particularly in the last 2-3 years where patients have attributed their injuries to, for example, heavy bags and flip flops.' He has seen multiple ills caused by fashion, such as plantar fasciitis from ill-fitting shoes, nerve trauma caused by weighty, oversized handbags and even cervical pain from excessive ad heavy accessories. Could following the latest trends be causing you long-term health problems? 1. Heavy necklaces . Mr Moyes says: 'Heavy necklaces are growing in popularity in modern fashion, and this in combination with the use of heavier handbags can produce protraction of the shoulder, curvature in the upper dorsal or thoracic spine and hyperextension of the lower cervical spine, which tends to force the head to thrust forwards. This can place a lot of strain on the base of the neck, causing lower cervical pain. 'These two problems on top of poor posture from a desk-based working environment produce a range of conditions that can cause pain in the base of the neck in the upper dorsal spine and pain and impingement in both shoulders. 'All these things produce tightness and shortening of the upper chest muscles, which produce impingement in the shoulders. 'Physiotherapists, personal trainers and orthopedic surgeons are seeing more and more patients with pain from these areas and it is very important to try and improve one's posture and general bio mechanics by straightening up the cervical and thoracic spine - you can do this by stretching out the chest muscles, improving posture and by regularly stretching.' 2. Flip-flops . Mr Moyes says: Although flip-flops are cool and comfortable in the heat, they can lead to a common condition called plantar fasciitis. 'This is a very painful condition, which produces pain in the sole of the foot and in the heel mainly on the inside of the foot. The plantar fascia is a thick sheet of tissue that runs from the heel to the ball of the foot supporting the deep layers of muscles and tendons in the foot. Even shoes you THINK are your friends, like flip flops, are slammed for lack of support . 'The lack of arch support and lack of cushioning combined with the way you walk in flip flops can predispose you to this condition. 'A particularly useful stretch for the plantar fascia is either using customised massage balls or you can also use tennis balls or golf balls. These are massaged directly into the painful areas of the plantar fascia and in the heel. These are combined with regular calf stretches to help relieve the symptoms although it will take a few weeks of such treatment to resolve matters. 'If your gym has a power plate you can combine usage of this with the aforementioned stretching regimes to have a more effective stretch of the plantar fascia and calf muscles and more acutely relieve symptoms. 'If the symptoms fail to respond to these simple stretching measures and alteration of footwear and activities then ultrasound guided steroid injections can be administered.' 3. High heels . Mr Moyes says: 'Many women prefer to wear high heels and are reliant on them for everyday use, but repeatedly wearing heeled shoes can lead to Achilles tendonitis. The Achilles tendon is the long thin tendon that runs from the base of the calf muscles down to the heel bone. This can become extremely painful due to chronic shortening of the calf muscles by wearing repeatedly high heel shoes. The pain is localised over the tendon and may be associated with thickening and swelling of the tendon. Heels and heavy handbags could mean double trouble, both put strain on your back and spine . 'The consequence of heeled shoes that women are most aware of is the increased risk of developing bunions and calluses, which are known to be aggravated by high heeled shoes, as the heel pushes the front of the foot into the shoe, crowding the toes. These bony growths aren't just unsightly, but can lead to long-term swelling, inflammation and pain. 'The prolonged wearing of high heels can produce hyperextension of the toes by pressing them into rigid unnatural forms. The more stiletto shaped the heel, the worse it is likely to be. The base of the big toe becomes deviated outwards forming a bunion, and, the sesamoid bones, the bones beneath the big toe, get dislodged by the enormous pressures in that area. 'The good news is that as long as it is only temporary use you should not necessarily damage your foot. You are more likely to develop bunions if you have a family history of this and you are genetically predisposed to the condition as the wearing of such heels may accelerate bunion development. 'The solution is to avoid wearing heels for extended periods of time and use sensible shoes alongside your killer heels.' 4. Handbags . 'Girls' handbags, like men's briefcases, can carry an enormous amount of material that can be surprisingly heavy. 'The way they are carried over the shoulder can predispose the development of chronic shoulder pain - namely inflammation and impingement of the rotator cuff. The heavy weight over the top of the shoulder tends to cause it to be protracted and the downward pressure on the cuff causes rubbing of the tendon. This causes shoulder pain, which is felt over the anterior and lateral deltoid. Patients may end up with pain at night, causing sleep disturbance, as well as pain using their arm at shoulder height. 'There may also be the development of crepitus or noises arising from the shoulder girdle as the arm is moved. 'To help avoid developing the condition, try to unload the heavier objects from the bag and change shoulders frequently to avoid pressure on one shoulder.'","London Fashion Week starts tomorrow, Friday September 12 .

"A choirgirl who was stabbed to death by her ex-boyfriend had reported him to police for assault six weeks earlier, her inquest has heard. Arsema Dawit, 15, was knifed more than 50 times by Thomas Nugusse in central London in June 2008, less than two months after she told police he had attacked her. An inquest into her death has heard that she and her family reported the beating in April that year, but feared at the time that nothing would be done. Arsema Dawit (left) died after she was stabbed by her jealous ex-boyfriend, Thomas Nugusse, in 2008. Her mother, Tsehynesh Medhane (right), went with her to report an assault to police weeks earlier . The inquest heard Arsema, her mother Tsehynesh Medhane and cousin Melyon Isak went to London's Kennington police station in April 2008 after Nugusse slapped her in a McDonald's. But Miss Isak told the inquest  that, after speaking to station receptionist Gillian Johnson, she felt the police were not taking the threat Nugusse posed seriously. She said: 'I remember giving her all the proof that we had and her asking for more proof. I did not think that anything would be done.' She told the inquest: 'When I said that she [Arsema] had been assaulted she [Ms Johnson] kind of laughed and said in a joking kind of way ""why did you let him do that to you?"" with a smile on her face.' The hearing was told that, even while the family were at the police station, Nugusse texted Miss Isak with the warning 'stay out of it don't get involved'. Mrs Medhane asked the police 'to arrest this person and [make] my daughter  safe', jurors heard. Police at the block of flats in Waterloo, central London where the 15-year-old's body was found stabbed in 2008 . Ms Johnson told the inquest today that, despite Arsema's age, the incident was not recorded as child abuse or domestic violence and was instead investigated as an assault. She said: 'A domestic is when two people are in a relationship and there's an assault within the relationship. It goes to a different unit that deals with domestic violence. 'A domestic is anybody who is over 17 in a relationship... She was too young so it wouldn't be domestic violence.' Arsema's body was found  by neighbours in a lift in the flats in a tower block in Waterloo on June 2 2008. A knife was also found in the lift. After his arrest, killer Nugusse, then aged 21, was found hanging in his cell on 24 June, but prison staff managed to revive him. Nugusse, formerly of Ilford, Essex, was left severely brain damaged and now needs 24-hour care. He was too unwell to be tried but was found to have committed the act by a jury five years ago and detained indefinitely under the Mental Health Act. The inquest, which was called after Arsema's family went to the Independent Police Complaints Commission, continues.

"Through months of court proceedings she has retained a steely and impassive demeanor, offering little insight into her emotions on the hearing that has unfolded before her and caught the attention of the world. Today however, all eyes will be on Judge Thokozile Masipa as she delivers her long-awaited verdict in the Oscar Pistorius murder trial - a decision that could see the athlete jailed for 25 years. Throughout the six month trial, Masipa has sat on a dais rarely interrupting the drama unfolding below as the prosecutor sought to prove that the Olympic athlete murdered girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp and defense lawyers argued that the shooting was a terrible mistake. Scroll down for video . Verdict: The eyes of the world have today turned on Judge Thokozile Masipa as she delivers her long-awaited verdict in the Oscar Pistorius murder trial - a decision that could see the athlete jailed for 25 years . Judgement day: Oscar Pistorius arrives at court in Pretoria for the long-awaited verdict in his murder trial over the Valentine's Day shooting of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp . Her cryptic demeanor however masks the rich history of the 66-year-old, a former social worker and journalist, who was only the second black woman to be appointed a high court judge in post-apartheid South Africa. She has been credited as being a good listener and a dispassionate analyst of facts. Experts have also, however, pointed to her record of tough action against criminals who have targeted women, suggesting this could be seen as an indicator she would not be easily swayed by Pistorius' assertion that he shot Steenkamp through a closed toilet door on February 14, 2013 by mistake, thinking there was an intruder in his house. Last year, she sentenced a serial rapist to 250 years in prison. In 2009, she sentenced a former police officer to life in prison for fatally shooting his wife after a dispute over separation terms. For some in South Africa, Masipa is seen as a symbol of accomplishment in a country where poverty and unemployment block progress even though all-race politics replaced white minority rule in a euphoric but troubled transition. Trial: Throughout the six month trial, Masipa has sat on a dais rarely interrupting the drama unfolding below as the prosecutor sought to prove that the Olympic athlete murdered girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp and defense lawyers argued that the shooting was a terrible mistake . Kabelo Seabi, a Pretoria lawyer who teaches criminal law, told The Associated Press: 'From our historical background in this country, it is very important that young black people see role models that are positive. 'I'm sure that a young female person that's sitting anywhere in South Africa... would be looking up to her and would wish that, if they were to study law, that they would be able to reach that benchmark that she has set.' In the rare instances in the Pistorius trial when her personality has shone through, Masipa has been stern, chiding the prosecutor for harshly questioning the double-amputee runner when he testified in April. And she lightened the mood in the wood-lined courtroom when she joked about making lawyers work 'after church' on a Sunday. Pistorius could face 25 years to life in prison if convicted of premeditated murder. He could also be convicted of a lesser murder charge or negligent killing, both of which call for years in jail. The judge could acquit him if she believes the 27-year-old made a tragic error . Seabi described her as a competent judge who gave 'latitude' to defense and prosecution arguments. Masipa will not 'decide the matter on her own' because she has two legal assistants, Seabi noted. 'There is a remote possibility of the judge going one way and the assessors going another, and the decision by the majority is the one that will stand, on the facts,' Seabi said. But, he said, only the judge decides on questions of legal principle. Masipa studied social work and later worked as a reporter for The World, The Sowetan and other South African publications, covering township life at a politically tumultuous time. Under apartheid, she was arrested during a protest against the detention of media colleagues, according to South African reports. Sekola Sello, who worked with Masipa in the media, said he has closely followed the Pistorius trial and that the judge was exhibiting the same 'level-headedness' that he remembered in her character decades ago. Glamorous couple: Oscar Pistorius with Reeva Steenkamp at the Feather Awards in Johannesburg, South Africa, in November 2012, three months before he killed her . In 1998, Masipa became a provincial judge on a bench that was still heavily populated by white males. She has ruled in favor of squatters who resisted attempts to evict them from a Johannesburg building and said authorities should help them find alternative lodging; and ruled against a former head of Eskom, the national electricity company, who alleged he was illegally dismissed. South Africa does not have a jury system, so Masipa will read her verdict today in a lengthy process, filled with summaries of testimony and legal references, that some analysts say might require more court time on Friday. Clues about the looming verdict could emerge during the reading, but Pistorius will only know the judgment for or against him at the end of what is likely to be a long reading that will grip the world's attention. Pistorius could face 25 years to life in prison if convicted of premeditated murder. He could also be convicted of a lesser murder charge or negligent killing, both of which call for years in jail. The judge could acquit him if she believes the 27-year-old made a tragic error.","Former social worker and journalist will today deliver verdict in murder trial .

"Police in New Zealand have been inundated with phone calls after the arrest of a hostel owner accused of sexually assaulting sixteen men. Detective Senior Sergeant Rhys Johnston said police had also received about 20 emails overnight from around the world from potential victims and those with information, and that the number was continuing to grow. Police made an official appeal on Wednesday to overseas tourists - possibly including Australians - who stayed at a backpackers’ lodge and suspect 'something happened to them there' to come forward with their stories. The 56-year-old New Zealand man who ran the backpackers' lodge appeared in court on Wednesday facing dozens of indecent assault charges involving 16 young men who were said to have been drugged. Police in New Zealand have been inundated with phone calls after the arrest of Michael Harris (above) who is accused of sexually assaulting sixteen men. Harris, who appeared in the Kaitaia District Court on Wednesday, was charged with almost 40 offences, including aggravated wounding related to allegedly drugging his victims to facilitate indecent assault and making intimate visual recordings. He was also charged of possession of intimate visual recordings and indecent assault and was remanded in custody to appear at the court again on September 18. The New Zealand Herald reported police said many of the victims are believed to have stayed temporarily in the main dwelling of the Main Street Lodge over the past two and a half years. The men were mainly overseas tourists aged between 18 and 25. The premises offers general backpacking facilities, hotel units and, on occasions, longer term accommodation in the owner’s residence. Asking backpackers to come forward, police said they were continuing their investigations. ‘It is very important for us to speak to anybody who has stayed in the owner’s residence over the last two and a half years,’ said Detective Senior Sergeant Rhys Johnson. ‘These victims are unlikely to know that something has happened to them, although they may have suspicions,’ the Herald quoted him as saying. Victims are believed to have stayed temporarily in the main dwelling of the Main Street Lodge over the past two and a half years . Police allege the 54-year-old drugged the men from overseas countries - possibly including those from Australia . ‘We will deal sensitively with them and offer all appropriate support required. ‘This is an ongoing investigation and we have a lot of work ahead to assess evidence and establish if there are further victims we are not yet aware of.’ To help potential victims contact the investigation team, police have set up an email address. Backpackers who believe they might have been indecently assaulted are asked to contact this email address: operations@police.govt.nz .","Police say there have received a spate of calls since making an appeal on Wednesday .

"A judge will wait until jury selection begins to determine whether to move the first-degree murder trial of a man accused of killing a teenager during an argument over loud music. Michael Dunn's attorneys on Thursday asked the court to move the case out of Jacksonville, Florida over concerns that intense local media coverage would make it impossible to find a fair jury. Circuit Court Judge Russell Healey said he will rule on any move after jury selection begins. It is scheduled for September 22. Defendant Michael Dunn in the courtroom for a hearing on Thursday. His lawyers have asked that his trial be moved out of Jacksonville, Florida because selecting a fair jury is impossible due to intense media coverage . The 47-year-old Dunn was convicted of three counts of attempted second-degree murder and firing into an occupied vehicle. He faces a minimum 60-year prison sentence, but the jury deadlocked on the first-degree murder charge for killing 17-year-old Jordan Davis. Jurors deadlocked in February on the first-degree murder charge against Michael Dunn, 47, in the shooting of the teenager outside a Jacksonville convenience store in November 2012. Jordan Davis was shot dead in 2012 at a convenience store in Jacksonville, Florida . Dunn showed no emotion as the verdicts were read earlier this year. Davis' parents each left the courtroom in tears. Ronald Davis also appeared at court on Thursday morning in Jacksonville for Dunn's hearing. During the trial, prosecutor Erin Wolfson told jurors that Dunn's 'blood started to boil' because of the vehicle-rattling 'thug music' coming from the SUV. Dunn claimed the music, which he described as 'rap c**p', was so loud it hurt his ears and caused his car to vibrate. Dunn claimed he acted in self-defense, testifying he thought he saw a firearm pointed at him from the SUV as Davis yelled insults at him and the argument escalated. No weapon was found in the SUV. Dunn told jurors he feared for his life, perceiving 'this was a clear and present danger.' Dunn, who has a concealed weapons permit, fired 10 shots, hitting the vehicle nine times. Prosecutors contended that Dunn opened fire because he felt disrespected by Davis. Dunn escalated the confrontation and fired in premeditated fashion because a teenager had disrespected him, the prosecutor said. She said: 'This defendant was disrespected by a 17-year-old teenager, and he lost it. He wasn't happy with Jordan Davis' attitude. What was his response? ''You're not going to talk to me like that.'"" 'He took these actions because it was premeditated. It was not self-defense.' Ronald Davis, the father of slain teen Jordan Davis, talks to the media outside Duval County Courthouse in Jacksonville on Thursday . However, Dunn's attorney argued that his client used legitimate self-defense after Davis let forth with an expletive-laced threat and rebuffed the prosecution's claim that Dunn was 'a madman with a gun'. The teen made his friend turn the hip hop music back up after they initially turned it down at Dunn's request. Dunn was parked in the spot next to the SUV outside the convenience store. That defendant didn't shoot into a carful of kids to save his life. He shot into it to save his pride,' Assistant State Attorney John Guy told the jury earlier in the week. 'Jordan Davis didn't have a weapon, he had a big mouth.' The trial was the latest Florida case to raise questions about self-defense and race, coming six months after George Zimmerman was acquitted in the shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Sanford, about 125 miles south of Jacksonville. The Dunn trial was prosecuted by the same State Attorney's Office that handled the Zimmerman case. Jordan Davis' mother, Lucia McBath (pictured with her husband Curtis McBath) leaves the courtroom during the original trial of Michael Dunn for the killing of her son .","Michael Dunn's attorneys today asked to move the case from Jacksonville, Florida over concerns intense coverage would make a fair jury impossible .

"Mother-of-four Leighanne Rumbelow, 26, sent abusive and threatening messages to herself, pretending to be student Leonard Smith, 21 . A mother-of-four who tried to frame a fellow student by sending herself abusive and threatening emails using his video game username has been jailed for eleven months. A police helicopter was scrambled and police dog units searched the area around Leighanne Rumbelow's house, in Foxborough Gardens, Brockley, south London, twice in the hunt for innocent Bromley College student Leonard Smith. Mr Smith, 21, was arrested three times, had his family home searched, electronic equipment seized and spent a total of thirty-five hours in police custody during the 'sustained, extended campaign' to frame him. Rumbelow, 26, initially blamed her sister for sending the emails but pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice between April 4 and June 2 last year. Woolwich Crown Court heard on Wednesday that Rumbelow, using Mr Smith's gaming username, 'Striker', sent herself emails which read: 'You'll have to watch your back. I know where your daughters are. 'You're [sic] life is over and so are your kids. I know you are home. I'll get you, your husband won't mind, you're a slut. 'Your husband is next. We'll get him when he's walking home. 'I can see you shutting your curtains. Goodnight, sleep well.' Prosecutor Neil Ross told the court: 'There was a persistent and deliberate series of false allegations against Mr Smith that led to his arrest, the seizure of property and considerable use of his time and resources.' In 2011 Rumbelow accused Mr Smith of touching her sexually, but the police did not pursue her complaint and early last year he tried to contact her on Facebook to 'clear the air'. 'As a result she went to the police and said she was being harassed and Mr Smith was given a warning,' explained Mr Ross. Rumbelow wrote herself abusive and threatening emails from 'Striker', and told police she wanted Mr Smith arrested. Mr Smith was arrested in the early hours of April 6 last year and was released shortly afterwards, but found himself in police custody again on April 7 - this time for twenty hours - when officers again attended his address in the middle of the night. On April 10, 14 and 22 Rumbelow repeated her lies, telling officers that she spotted Mr Smith in her garden, from where he emailed further threats. This led to a helicopter search and sniffer dogs being dispatched to the surrounding area. On May 31 Rumbelow told police she received another email from Mr Smith which read: 'I see you are cheating on me again. I'm going to slit your throat you dirty little slag.' 'Phone the police and I swear you'll get it,' read another email, resulting in Mr White spending another five hours in police custody. Officers became suspicious and it was revealed that the IP address of the 'Striker' emails was traced to the home Rumbelow shared with her mother and sister. A police helicopter was scrambled and police dog units searched the area around Leighanne Rumbelow's house in Brockley, South London, Woolwich Crown Court heard. Emma Stuart Smith, defending, told the court: 'She's vulnerable due to her emotional and mental health condition. She realises she was selfish in her actions.' Mr Smith said in a statement: 'The whole ordeal was very distressing.' Judge Alan Saggerson said: 'This is an offence of great severity and gravity. The offence brought with it a high level of harm. 'The public confidence in the entire criminal justice system is undermined when allegations are fabricated against innocent people and resources are wasted making inquiries, using helicopters and dog units and wasting police man hours. 'Not only was an innocent man arrested three times during your extended sequence of lies, spending thirty-five hours in custody, but you also caused suspicion to fall on other innocent people, including his mother and sister and their property was searched. 'Suspicion also fell on your own mother and sister, particularly your sister, who you continued to blame. 'This was not a single, isolated allegation, but a sustained, extended campaign in creating these false emails. 'They were repeated messages that you fabricated to to sustain your fictitious claims and must have involved significant thought and planning on your part.'","Leighanne Rumbelow told officers Leonard Smith was sending her threats .

"For some people, being buried alive is the worst fear imaginable. It even has a scientific name-taphophobia- which comes from the Greek word for grave, taphos.

"Mike Tyson swore at a television presenter live on air after he brought up his conviction for rape. The former  world heavyweight champion had been expressing his support for Toronto mayor Rob Ford when the presenter suggested that Tyson's 1992 conviction may actually harm Ford's bid for re-election. After initially saying he had 'no comment' to make, the 48-year-old said to CP24 news anchor Nathan Downer: 'You're being negative. I met the mayor and there's nothing they can do about it.' Mike Tyson directed an expletive-filled rant at a Canadian television anchor in a live interview after the host brought up the former heavyweight champion's conviction for sexual assault . Mike Tyson swore at the television presenter live on air, calling him a 'rat piece of s***' Tyson was jailed in the 1990s for raping 18-year-old beauty queen Desiree Washington in an Indianapolis hotel room which he has always denied. He received 10 years for each charge on which he was convicted - one count of rape and two of criminal deviate conduct. After suspending four years from each, the judge ordered the sentences to run concurrently and he served three years of a six-year sentence. In the interview Tyson said to his interviewer: 'You come across like a nice guy but you're really a piece of s***. F*** you, that (question) was a piece of s***.' Downer then puts up his hands and says 'Hey, come on. We're doing live TV now.' In a tweet after the incident, Downer told his followers he was 'not taking it personally' New friends: Mike Tyson and Mayor Rob Ford at Toronto City Hall - Tyson later called Ford the 'best mayor in Toronto history' Tyson responds: 'I don't care. What are you going to do about it?' Downer then asks Tyson about his one-man show 'Mike Tyson: Undisputed Truth.' Tyson appeared on CP24 with the Canadian promoter of the show. Tyson tells Downer the show it 'speaks for itself' before the promoter talks about it. When asked about whether he found acting or boxing more nerve racking, Tyson responded: 'It's more nerve-wracking talking to a rat piece of s*** like you.' 'Come on, Mike,' Downer responds. Tyson insults him again before Downer wraps up the interview and thanks Tyson for coming as Tyson swears at him. In a tweet after the incident, Downer said it was unfortunate his question hurt Tyson's feelings and that it wasn't his intention. 'I'm okay everybody,' Downer tweeted. Mike Tyson leaves court after being convicted of raping beauty queen Desiree Washington, which he has always denied. He was jailed in 1992 . Downer apologized for the language and followed that up with another tweet. 'No ill will toward Mike Tyson. He lashed out at me and that's okay. Not taking it personally.' In his turbulent life Tyson has been married three times, fathered eight children and became the youngest heavyweight champion the world has ever seen at just 20. But fame ruined him and his troubled upbringing - his mother was a prostitute and he never knew his pimp father - came back to haunt him. Mug shot: In his turbulent life Tyson has been married three times, fathered eight children and became the youngest heavyweight champion the world has ever seen at just 20 . He used to keep a white Bengal Tiger named Kenya in his backyard. It cost him around £2,000 a month just to care for him, and the story goes that one day Kenya got loose and caused quite a commotion in Southington, Ohio. He was also in the grip of numerous addictions; to sex, often with strippers and prostitutes, even though he was married with children; and to spending on an improbable scale. He spent around £200million, much of it on gifts to people he barely knew, on cars he never drove, and on bad business deals which he barely troubled to understand. Tyson bites the ear of Evander Holyfield's during their infamous 1997 fight . He was also addicted to alcohol and drugs, having a long dependence on marijuana and a fondness for cocaine and Hennessy brandy. Three years ago, he was jailed for driving under the influence of cocaine and was found with three bags of the drug in his car. At times, he has used prescription drugs like Zoloft for depression, too. 'I'm on the Zoloft to keep me from killing y'all,' he once announced at a press conference. After years of controversial headlines, at the age of 39, Tyson retired in 2005 – but he admits he’s ‘the same guy – I just grew up a little bit’. He has spent his recent years trying to reconnect with his six children by four different mothers.

"An Afghan hound is top dog for fashion after he was spotted showing off this stylish tartan snood. Two-year-old Ari has become a minor celebrity in his home town of Blackburn, Lancashire, after locals expressed their love of the strange garment, which keeps his flowing black hair out of his mouth and eyes. The award-winning pup wears the custom-made accessory when out walking and when he eats to avoid getting food in his well-groomed hair. Ari the two-year-old Afghan hound has become a minor celebrity in his home town thanks to his tartan snood . Without the garment, the dog's flowing black hair gets in his eyes, meaning he cannot see where he is going . Owner Mark White said: 'You wouldn't believe how often we get stopped when I take him out for walks. 'People always want to know why he's wearing the snood and I have to take it off to show them his long hair. He certainly gets a lot of attention.' Mr White, who owns two Afghan hounds, added: 'We have always used snoods as they help keep hair out of the dog's face. 'Many people just use them for eating to make mealtimes less messy, but we also use them when we are out walking so that Ari can see where he is going. 'The snood helps to keep their long coats from getting into their eyes and mouth. 'If the hair did get stuck they would chew on it to try and get it out - and we couldn't enter him into shows if he had one ear shorter than the other.' The pup also wears the snood when eating so that he does not get food in the long hair on his head . Owner Mark White says his dog is a huge hit in Blackburn, where locals regularly stop and ask about the snood . Ari is not the only one bringing the snood back into fashion and a similar garment made an appearance  when a man dubbed 'Scarf Guy' stole the show at the Apple iPhone 6 launch on Tuesday. Gaming executive Tommy Krul wore a purple knit scarf when he demonstrated a game at the high profile event, sparking a wave of interest in the fashion accessories online. Mr White added: 'The dogs don't mind wearing the scarves at all, he has been wearing one since he was a small puppy so he is completely used to it. 'We used to have three Afghan Hounds, so you can imagine how much attention they got when I took them out together. 'The head scarves can be bought from all champ shows, and they are often custom made to fit each individual dog.' Ari competes in dog shows almost every weekend and recently won best in class in the Minor Puppy section of the Northern Afghan Hound Show in St Helens, Merseyside. Mr White, 47, who also owns a 13-year-old Afghan called Ola, added: 'Ari is such a fun dog to be around - but he is quite mischievous. 'He competes in dog shows very regularly but Afghans mature quite late so he still acts like a puppy and sometimes can act a bit daft when he is in the arena.' The dog's fashion hit comes after gaming executive Tommy Krul - dubbed 'Scarf Guy' - was praised for wearing a similar garment at Apple's iPhone 6 launch this week .

"The last surviving rescue dog who searched Ground Zero for survivors and lifted the spirits of devastated first responders has returned to the site on the 13th anniversary of the tragedy. Bretagne, a 15-year-old golden retriever, was just two when she and her owner, Denise Corliss, were sent from Texas to relieve search teams in New York - on what was their first ever deployment. This week, Corliss and Bretagne, which is pronounced 'Brittany', returned to the Manhattan site for the first time since 2001. 'Seeing this kind of took my breath away a bit, similar to how the pile was the first time I saw it,' Corliss, 49, told the Today.com. 'It's so calm and peaceful now, unlike the chaos of before.' Scroll down for video . Heroic: Bretagne the golden retriever sits at the World Trade Center site, where she helped search for survivors 13 years ago. It is the first time she and her handler, who live in Texas, have been back . Team: Owner and handler Denise Corliss is pictured with Bretagne at Ground Zero in New York City in 2001 . The duo, from Cypress, Texas, were sent to the site to take over from the first wave of first responders a week after the terrorist attacks took nearly 3,000 lives. They knew it was unlikely they would find anyone alive, but Corliss was still hopeful. 'I really believed we could find somebody - anybody - if we could just get to the right void space,' she told Today. 'But our reality was much different. We found all various kinds of remains, some recognizable, others not so much.' It was their job to search an area of debris for survivors and once they were confident no one was there, they gave crews permission to clear that area of debris. Tired out: Corliss and Bretagne were sent to Ground Zero a week after the attacks and worked 12-hour days . Taking a break: The team stop for a nap amid the rubble during their search in September 2001 . But they quickly realized Bretagne also had other roles to fill as they worked 12-hour shifts for two weeks. In one instance, Bretagne ran away from her owner and over to a firefighter sitting sadly on the ground - and even when Corliss tried to get her to return, she refused. 'I was surprised that she wasn't listening to me, but she really wasn't - it was like she was flipping me the paw,' Corliss said. 'She went right to that firefighter and laid down next to him and put her head on his lap.' Often, as the duo sat waiting for their next task, first responders would approach Bretagne and pet her and share their stories. 'It became an unexpected role of a therapy dog,' Corliss said on the Today show. Corliss agrees, too, that Bretagne - her best friend - has been there for her over the years. Return: Corliss spoke to the Today show's Tom Brokaw after visiting the site ahead of the 13th anniversary . She said  her breath was taken away with how peaceful and quiet the site is now, unlike the chaos of 2001 . By her side: Bretagne, who also sat in on the Today interview, is older but no less energetic, Corliss said . Emotional: They are seen visiting the pools at the memorial, where 13 years ago they searched for victims . They first started working together after Corliss, an electrical engineer, became interested in the work of disaster search dogs and looked into getting involved. She learned that civilians can train their own dogs and, as long as they pass tests, they can support federal emergency response teams when disasters strike in the U.S. In 1999, she took in eight-week-old Bretagne and got to work with her right away. She told the Today show that it took between 20 and 30 hours of rigorous training every week - which she did when she wasn't working - and in 2000, they qualified to join Texas Task Force 1. After helping in the aftermath of 9/11, they were also deployed to sites, including Hurricane Katrina. Bretagne retired from searches at age nine, but she still enjoys working as a service dog in a local elementary school, where she helps children with special needs read out loud. Heroic: After 9/11 - which was their first assignment - Corliss and Bretagne helped after Hurricane Katrina . New job: Bretagne retired for searches when she turned nine but she now works as a service dog in schools . Giving them confidence: She works with children at elementary schools to help them learn how to read aloud . 'She still has this attitude of putting her paw up and saying, ""Put me in, coach!""' Corliss said. 'She absolutely loves it.' Bretagne is now one of eight finalists for the American Humane Association's annual Hero Dog Awards and will be traveling to Beverly Hills for the award ceremony in late September.

"Dave Molter, 84, collapsed while trying to give his ailing wife Corrine, 83, CPR, police have said . An 84-year-old man collapsed and died while giving his ailing wife CPR, police said. Dave and Corrine Molter, who had been together for more than 60 years, were found dead in their home on Lake Wylie, South Carolina on Monday. Their carer, Brandy Williams, found the couple after kicking open the door when no one answered. It is believed that Mrs Molter, 83, was in the advance stages of Alzheimer's, and that her husband had become her constant companion. Ms Williams, who had visited Mr and Mrs Molter three days a week since May, said the couple shared 'the kind of love you see in the movies.' She told WSOC: ' [They were] just wonderful people. I've never met anybody like that in my life. 'They had the kind of love you see in the movies, not the kind you see in real life.' The couple have a daughter who lives in Hawaii, a son in North Carolina - and siblings in Florida and Maryland. Neighbours said that Mrs Molter had been known to wander from her home and that Mr Molter had taken to following her on walks to make sure she didn't fall into the lake near their home. The couple lived in a house, believed to be one of the oldest in the neighbourhood, that Mr Molter had built himself. Mr Molter was a member of the Steele Creek Masonic Lodge. Friends there said that he brought his wife to meetings because he couldn't leave her. Mr Molter  worked on the health and happiness committee, which kept track of births, illnesses, deaths, and any kind of important events in the lives of lodge members. Wray Moxley, a fellow Masonic Lodge member, told WSOC that it was 'fitting' that they died together. He said: 'He really loved her. We all knew if something ever happened, he'd take care of her.' York County Coroner Sabrina Gast said that no autopsies are planned because there was nothing suspicious at the house, and no foul play is suspected. Mr and Mrs Molter's carer Brandy Williams said that the couple, pictured, had the 'kind of love you only see in movies'.

"Former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger lifted the curtain on his official portrait Monday, revealing a photograph-like giant image of the onetime bodybuilder standing in front of the official California seal—only something wasn't right. When Schwarzenegger unveiled the portrait at a ceremony in the state Capitol in in Sacramento nearly four years after he left office and three years after his split from longtime wife Maria Shriver, a mysterious splotch could be made out on the left lapel of painted Arnie. That splotch is where a small lapel pin portrait of Shriver once was—just as it was there in real life when he sat for the painting in 2003—before someone amateurishly scrubbed it off before the unveiling, reports Page Six. Scroll down for videos . Somethings off: Arnold made his big unveiling of his official California statehouse painting on Monday, but something immediately appeared strange . Hasty job: On the former governor's left lapel was an undeniable smirching that some say is where a pin that held a photo of Maria Shriver was hastily scrubbed off . Splotchy: Capitol officials were shocked at the amateurish job done covering up whatever was on Arnold's lapel . 'Whoever touched it up did not do a very good job,' tour guide Richard Granis told The Post. 'It was softball sized, right there on his left lapel.' It's not clear when the pin was haphazardly scrubbed out, but it was revealed just after news broke that Shriver may have cheated on Schwarzenegger with the governor's chief political strategist long before Arnie's lovechild with the maid made his strong-jawed appearance on the national stage. The oversized portrait of a youthful Schwarzenegger, which will eventually hang on the third floor, was painted by Austrian artist Gottfried Helnwein, a realist who previously illustrated Andy Warhol and John F. Kennedy. Schwarzenegger, a movie star before he ran for governor in the chaotic recall election of 2003, said he owes all his successes in life to California, which he called a mythical place 'where nothing is impossible.' As a boy growing up in Austria, he dreamed about the state, he said. 'I dreamt about California every day, and I knew that one day I would have to come here to this beautiful state if I wanted to make my dreams a reality,' he said. Schwarzenegger said that while he always dreamed big, he never envisioned his portrait hanging in the state Capitol, joking 'I might have envisioned a sculpture on Muscle Beach.' Two of Schwarzenegger's five children attended the unveiling, Christopher, 16, and Patrick, 20, which also included political notables including at least three former speakers of the state Assembly, Willie Brown, Bob Hertzberg and Fabian Nunez. He also posed for photos with former staff and lawmakers and hugged 28-year-old John Masterson, who has Down syndrome and worked in the governor's mailroom. Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom said the massive image of Schwarzenegger is appropriate because Schwarzenegger is 'larger than life.' Singer Jerry Garcia 'had a wonderful quote saying, `You don't want to be the best of the best. You want to be the only one that does what you do,' ' Newsom said. 'And it's a way to describe Arnold Schwarzenegger.' Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg, D-Sacramento, called it 'just right.' 'I thought it was very dignified. It actually looked like a photograph to me,' he said. Revenge? Arnold's splotchy lapel was revealed just days after reports emerged that Maria Shriver may have been unfaithful to the former governor . True to his outsized life, Schwarzenegger's portrait is larger than those of other modern-day governors, roughly half a foot wider and a foot taller than his predecessor, according to the Department of General Services. The former governor paid for the portrait himself at an undisclosed cost. The portrait unveiling followed an event earlier Monday in which Schwarzenegger's University of Southern California-based institute hosted a climate symposium that also featured Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat. The seminar highlighted the state's aggressive efforts to tackle issues such as reducing carbon emissions. 'While the politicians in Washington can't get anything done because of being stuck in these ideological foxholes, we here in California have two governors from two different parties, together in the same room fighting for the same green energy future,' Schwarzenegger said at the summit. Organizers are using the state's policies to prompt further action ahead of United Nations climate-change conferences in Peru and Paris. During his tenure, Schwarzenegger signed California's landmark 2006 global-warming law, AB32, which paved the way for the state's system of selling carbon pollution credits aimed at reducing emissions. Brown praised Schwarzenegger's accomplishment in winning bipartisan support for the climate change law. 'To get AB32 through the California legislature, that is heavy lifting, and I don't think anyone should underestimate that. I'm not sure any other governor might have done this,' he said at the symposium. Schwarzenegger said that California leaders of all political stripes have chosen to address climate change because not doing so will cost much more in the long run in things such as state infrastructure at risk of failure because of flooding, increased heat- and pollution-related deaths, and a never-ending wildfire season that stretches state budgets. As governor, Schwarzenegger promised to bring fiscal accountability, but the state faced a huge budget deficit when he left office. In one of his final acts in office, Schwarzenegger commuted the involuntary-manslaughter sentence of the son of Nunez, a former political ally. Months after Schwarzenegger left office, embarrassing revelations emerged about an affair he had with his maid that resulted in a son born out of wedlock. The disclosure devastated his marriage to Maria Shriver, and the two are separated. Other man? Matthew Dowd, once Schwarzenegger's top aide, has been named as Shriver's lover while she was still supposedly happily married to Schwarzenegger .

"The number of aggrieved workers bringing sex discrimination claims to employment tribunals has tumbled by 90 per cent in a year since claimants were made to pay a fee. It appears that the prospect of forking out in advance – and losing the money if their case fails – is deterring many of those who may be tempted to use a tribunal to make their employer pay compensation. But Labour business spokesman Chuka Umunna has promised to abolish the fees, claiming they are unfair. Costs: It appears that the prospect of paying in advance – and losing the money if their case fails – is deterring many who may be tempted to use a tribunal to make their employer pay compensation. File picture . Figures published yesterday by the Ministry of Justice showed there were 6,310 sex discrimination cases in the three months before the charges were introduced in July last year. During the same period of this year, there were just 591 – a 90 per cent fall. Race discrimination claims are down 60 per cent, from 1,089 to 422. Overall, 44,334 claims of all types were made to tribunals between April and June 2013. By this spring the figure was just 8,540 – a fall of 81 per cent. The situation contrasts sharply with that in 2008. Then, sex discrimination cases were running at almost 27,000 a year, just before the recession made jobs more valuable and claims less common. In the financial year that ended last March, there were still 18,814 claims made. But the new fee system is having such an impact that there will be fewer than 2,500 made this year if the pattern of this spring continues. Workers who want to bring a tribunal case in a straightforward argument over an employers’ alleged failure to pay them their proper wages now have to pay a fee of £390. Discrimination cases, most of which involve allegations of sex or race bias, cost £1,200. The poorest claimants can have their fees waived or reduced. If claimants win, the tribunal can order the employer to cover the cost of their fees. But if they lose, they must foot the bill themselves. The fees have been welcomed by employers, who face an average cost of £8,500 each time a case is brought. But they have produced a wave of protests from union leaders, lawyers and Labour politicians. Earlier this week, Mr Umunna told the TUC a Labour government would abolish the fee system and replace it with a means-test one that ‘ensures all workers have proper access to justice’.Richard Fox, head of employment law at legal firm Kingsley Napsley, said: ‘We really have reached the situation where many voices are coming together to say something must be done. ‘There is now a serious question of access to justice on account of the level at which fees were introduced. It can be no coincidence that Chuka Umunna took the opportunity at this week’s TUC conference to propose a new system for dealing with this issue.’ But Tory Justice Minister Shailesh Vara said: ‘Hard-working taxpayers should not be picking up the bill for employment disputes in tribunals, and it is reasonable to expect people to contribute towards the £74million bill for the service.’ He added: ‘It is important to remember the Government has taken measures to ensure that those who have limited means ... are not excluded from seeking redress in tribunals. ‘The Government is on the side of people who want to work hard and get on.’","Cases brought on race or sex claims cost aggrieved workers £1,200 .

"Apology: Circuit Judge Mike Maggio has admitted posting confidential case information online . An Arkansas judge has admitted to posting a series of anonymous online comments, including ones that divulged secret information about Charlize Theron's adoption of her son. Circuit Judge Mike Maggio, 52, acknowledged on . Wednesday that he also posted comments that are racist, sexist and offensive towards the LGBT community over the past several years. Maggio, who also ended his campaign for a seat on the Arkansas Court of Appeals on Wednesday, made the comments on a Louisiana State University . fan message board, under the name 'geauxjudge'. Comments in January 2012 divulged details of Theron's adoption two months before she publicly released the information, while others talked about women in a derogatory way and another likened bestiality to sex in the transgender and gay communities. 'I take full responsibility for the comments that have been attributed to me,' Maggio, a father-of-five, said in a statement. 'I apologize deeply for my lapse in personal judgment and for that, I have no excuse. The comments posted were not acceptable. These comments are not a reflection of who I am.' The state's Judicial Discipline and . Disability Commission is investigating Maggio's postings, said its . executive director, David Sachar. Maggio, . whose term as a 20th Judicial District judge expires this . year, asked for privacy for his family. He has three sons and two daughters from a previous relationship and lives with his partner, Dawn. Revealed: He divulged that Charlize Theron had adopted a son two months before she announced it publicly in 2012. She is pictured in 2013 with the boy, Jackson, whom she adopted from South Africa . Confidential: Postings on the website TigerDroppings.com show him discussing confidential information . Offensive: He provided the details about her adoption in January 2012 - 2 months before it was public . He didn't immediately respond to . an email or phone message left at his office.

Inappropriate: He made offensive remarks about how people's names determine if they are criminals . He . said a 'judge friend' handled the case, before admitting that he was also . involved in the case. When a poster asked if she had adopted a black . child, he said that she had. Such . proceedings are confidential in Arkansas, and there are no cases in the . state's online court records that mention Theron's name. Her publicist, . Amanda Silverman, declined to comment. In a June 2011 posting, 'geauxjudge' suggested that women who seek divorces after their husbands cheat may be . better off financially by staying married. In Arkansas, circuit judges . like Maggio handle divorce cases, among other civil and criminal . casework. 'I see it . everyday,' he wrote. 'A woman makes (an) emotional decision to divorce . because the husband stepped out. When otherwise he was a good provider, . father, and husband. 'Then a . year or two later realizes uh oh I am worse off financially, . emotionally and relationship wise but hey they showed that SOB. Too many . times the women get their advice from other divorced women.' Cruel: Maggio also made sexist remarks (top) and compared bestiality to 'TBBLBS sex' an apparent reference to transgender, gay, lesbian or bisexual sex (bottom). He has admitted to the remarks . In another, he made derogatory comments about women, saying they needed to take care of a man's two basic needs for sex and food, adding: 'It takes two to pull the wagon'. In a posting from last December about baby names, 'geauxjudge' wrote about the effect a name can have on an individual's success, the website reported. 'How many Doctors do you hear named Dr. Taneesha or HaHa?' he wrote, apparently referring to Ha'Sean 'Ha Ha' Clinton-Dix, a black University of Alabama football player. 'How many bankers do (you) hear named Brylee? So stick with something close to normal. Or come sit in criminal court any day and see the ""common names"".' Responding to a story about a woman who was arrested for allegedly having sex with a dog, 'geauxjudge' wrote that it was 'just a small step' from having 'TGGLBS' sex, an apparent reference to transgender, gay, lesbian or bisexual sex.","Circuit Judge Mike Maggio admitted to being behind a series of racist, sexist and inappropriate messages on an LSU message board .

"The Scottish independence referendum is still a week away - but one airport appears to regard it as a foregone conclusion. A British traveller was shocked to be offered the 'Scottish pound' at a bureau de change in Dubai yesterday, apparently in anticipation of Scotland setting up its own currency. The tourist joked: 'It seems that some people have already decided the outcome of the independence vote.' Scroll down for video . Hasty? Dubai International Airport appeared to offer a 'Scottish pound' at its bureau de change . The 'Scottish pound' was being advertised at Dubai International Airport on a list of currencies which also included the British pound sterling. It was offered at an exchange rate of 5.75 UAE dirhams to the pound - the same rate as the real pound. Nick London, an English documentary maker, saw the bizarre mistake as he was travelling to South Africa. 'The British pound was at the top and Scottish pound was as a separate currency,' he said. 'It seems that some people have already decided the outcome of the independence vote.' Debate: The currency to be used in an independent Scotland has been the subject of fierce disagreement . The 'pound Scots' was Scotland's currency during the Middle Ages, but was abolished at the time of the Union with England in 1707. Although Scottish banks print pound banknotes, they are not a separate currency and are accepted in the rest of Britain. The future of the pound in Scotland has been one of the fiercest debates during the independence campaign. Defiant: Alex Salmond has repeatedly insisted that Scotland would be able to share the pound . Nationalists, led by Alex Salmond, insist that an independent Scotland would be able to carry on using the pound in a formal currency union with the rest of the UK. However, the leaders of all three major British parties have ruled out this possibility, saying it would force taxpayers outside Scotland to guarantee Scotland's debt. If Scotland does become independent after next Thursday's vote, other options include sharing the pound on an informal basis, setting up a new Scottish currency or joining the eurozone.","Traveller spotted bizarre blunder at Dubai International Airport .

"Murder detectives admitted today they were no closer to finding the killer of a frail 93-year-old pensioner who died after being savagely beaten as she lay in bed. Emma Winnall suffered horrific head injuries and was left with a partially-severed finger following the brutal attack at her flat in Moseley, Birmingham. Birmingham Coroner Louise Hunt has now concluded at an inquest that the grandmother-of-seven was unlawfully killed - as police said they had no suspects. Shocking: Emma Winnall, 93, suffered horrific head injuries and was left with a partially severed finger following the brutal attack at her flat in Moseley, Birmingham . The coroner told Mrs Winnall’s family: ‘She was unlawfully killed because it is the assault that let to her sad death. I am sorry as a family you have had no true sense of justice in this case. ‘The police have carried out an extensive investigation to identify a suspect. If future evidence comes to light I am sure they would pursue the matter with some vigour.’ The court heard the pensioner was put to bed on the night of April 30, 2012, at her flat by carer Nina Joshi, who then left and locked the door. But when she returned at 8.30am the next day Mrs Winnall was screaming from her bed and was found covered in blood. Home: Mrs Winnall was found at her flat in Moseley (pictured) screaming from her bed and covered in blood . Daughter Joyce Blencoe told the inquest: ‘Her head was bleeding and I couldn’t understand that, her hair was covered with blood, it was all down the side of her head. Her pillow was soaked with blood. 'I lifted back the cover, her left arm was twice the size it should have been, her little finger was severed and just hanging there. She said someone had tried to murder her' Joyce Blencoe, daughter . ‘I lifted back the cover, her left arm was twice the size it should have been, her little finger was severed and just hanging there. She said someone had tried to murder her.’ Mrs Winnall was taken to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital nearby where she remained until her death on May 29 from pneumonia. Detective Inspector Justin Spanner from West Midlands Police said there was no clear motive for the attack and added anybody who entered the property that night must have used a key. Treatment: Mrs Winnall was taken to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital (above) where she remained until her death . And while forensic investigators found blood spattered on the wall around her bed, the officer said no secondary blood transfers were found anywhere else in the flat. 'I am sorry as a family you have had no true sense of justice in this case' Louise Hunt, Birmingham Coroner . He said: ‘I have investigated a number of murders and this is the exception. Not to find a secondary transfer of blood is very unusual.’ DI Spanner added: ‘The police investigation has not identified any witnesses to an assault and there is no CCTV evidence that identified any persons responsible. Forensics has not identified a suspect. There are currently no suspects.’ Charity Crimestoppers and Midland advertising executive Trevor Beattie had offered a £10,000 reward to help find the killer.

"New diet pill Contrave has won approval to . be sold in the United States, only the third . obesity treatment in more than a decade to win approval from the . Food and Drug Administration. Made by Orexigen Therapeutics Inc, Contrave is a combination of the antidepressant bupropion and Orexigen's . formulation of naltrexone, designed to prevent drug dependence. The company, which received its approval on Wednesday, did not say when the pill would become available or how much it would cost. New diet pill: Contrave, which was granted approval for sale in the U.S. on Wednesday, is a combination of the antidepressant bupropion and Orexigen's formulation of naltrexone, designed to prevent drug dependence . The FDA in June had delayed its decision on the drug by . three months due to concerns about adequate warnings on the . packaging. Because Contrave contains an antidepressant, it will carry a . warning about increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Contrave joins Vivus Inc's Qsymia and Arena . Pharmaceuticals Inc's Belviq, both approved in 2012, in . the battle to be the treatment of choice and at least one . analyst expects the new entrant's sales to top that of its . rivals by 2016. The two existing treatments were billed as potential . blockbusters but have had lukewarm sales, hurt by bungled . launches and marketing strategies, as well as adverse effects . ranging from depression to heart risks. The drugs also face reimbursement challenges. Government and . private health insurers are reluctant to cover Belviq and . Qsymia, unconvinced of their long-term efficacy and given that . patients often drop out of the treatment. 'For all the obesity drugs that are out there, only 30 to 40per cent of the health maintenance organizations pay for obesity . coverage,' said Daniel Lang, co-portfolio manager at RS . Investments' Value Fund, which holds a stake in Orexigen. 'That speaks to the relative apathy towards obesity as a . serious condition.' Still, Wells Fargo analyst Matthew Andrews expects . Contrave's U.S. sales to eclipse that of Belviq and Qsymia by . 2016. Contrave sales are expected to be about $200million in . 2016, slightly higher than Belviq's $180million and well ahead . of Qsymia's $150million, said Andrews, who covers all three . companies. Arena reported Belviq sales of $5.7million in 2013, with . $5.3million of that attributable to its partner Eisai Co. Qsymia's sales were $23.7million. Reimbursements will remain a challenge for the foreseeable . future until insurers are convinced they can be justified even . without improvements in cardiovascular health. 'If these obesity cardiovascular outcomes trials do show . that they reduce heart attacks, or hospitalizations, then ... the market would be reignited,' said Lang, a trained . cardiologist. Orexigen's Contrave, slated to enter Europe before both . Qsymia and Belviq, is licensed in North America to Takeda . Pharmaceutical Co. It will be marketed by a 900-strong sales force, compared . with Arena and partner Eisai Co's 600 and Vivus' even . smaller sales force. Historically, weight loss drug developer's have met with . regulatory ire, as debilitating side effects associated with . their pills led to their forced removal. Among these are the notorious 'fen-phen' combination that . was pulled out in 1997 due to heart valve problems and Sanofi . SA's Acomplia, taken off the market in 2008. Trading in Orexigen shares was halted after market closed. Nasdaq stated the reason was pending news. The company plans to . hold a conference call on Thursday.

"Two U.S. Senators put aside their political differences in August and spent a week together on a deserted island with no fresh water last month for a reality TV show that will air on the Discovery Channel in October. The one-episode series called Rival Survival will feature Arizona Republican Jeff Flake and New Mexico Democrat Martin Heinrich marooned in the Marshall Islands for six days and six nights. The purpose of the dramatic week-long getaway, the senators said in a statement, was to prove that bipartisanship isn't dead. Sens. Jeff Flake, left, and Martin Heinrich, right, attempt to start a fire while surviving on the remote Eru island, part of the Marshall Islands, for the Discovery Channel's Rival Survival. The two U.S. senators from opposite sides of the political aisle spent a week marooned together on a remote island for the new reality show . Republican Sen. Jeff Flake is pictured on the left speaking to reporters in the Capitol in November. Sen. Martin Heinrich, a Democrat from New Mexico, is pictured on the right arriving in the Capitol for a vote in April . 'Both of us know just how frustrated people are with Washington right now. We can both attest that no one is more frustrated than those of us trying to get things done in this environment,' they said. 'So we decided to do something completely out of the ordinary and frankly a little extreme to show the world and our colleagues that even if you have serious differences, if you want to survive you have to work together.' The two freshman senators secretly filmed the adventure on the island of Eru while Congress was in recess last month. Flake, who is an experienced survivalist, told the Washington Post on Thursday that he and Heinrich had originally planned to shoot the documentary themselves and have someone else produce it for them. 'Then we approached Discovery because they have a number of survivor shows and they said, well, we like the idea but how about you let us come film it?' Flake said. A description of the show released by Discovery says that the 'unusual pairing will leave behind the daily life of congressional staff, senate hearings and committee meetings to navigate the rigors of surviving on an isolated island with no contact with the outside world to call upon for help. Sen. Jeff Flake has marooned himself in the Marshall Islands twice before in 2009 and and 2013. The second time he took his teenage sons, Tanner, left, and Dallin, right, with him at their urging . 'Using only these limited resources and their wits' the unlikely allies must work together 'to spear fish, build shelter and find enough water to survive for one week.' 'There is no natural source for fresh water on Eru, and what lives in the ocean will be their major food source,' the statement says. While the Survivor-style show is an oddity, Flake is no amateur at playing house on a deserted island, having stranded himself in the Marshall Islands on two other occasions in the last five years. In August of 2009, when he was still serving in the House of Representatives, Flake spent a week alone on the island of Jabonwod. Excerpts of a diary the congressman kept during his time on the island revealed that the Senator had been dreaming of being a castaway since he was a child. 'I have the best job in the world, but still the islands beckon,' he said in a section printed in the Washington Post. 'No food, just mask, fins and a pole-spear to obtain it. No water, only a manual desalination pump to create fresh water,' Flake wrote. 'No matches, only a magnifying glass. And a hammock, knife, hatchet, sunscreen, cooking pot and salt and pepper. Oh, and a satellite phone and Coast Guard beacon should I eat the wrong fish and a Sharpie pen to scrawl a desperate message for rescuers.' Flake again snuck off to the string of islands in the Pacific Ocean last year over Memorial Day weekend - that time at the behest of his two teenage sons, Tanner and Dallin, who he'd promised to take on a their own after his Senate campaign concluded. The trio spent the holiday weekend on the island of Biggarenn together. 'We came back a little thinner. Maybe a little wiser. We had an awesome time, it was great,' Flake told the Post after that trip. 'For a dad it was a wonderful thing. No video games around, no television, no distractions, no texting,' Flake said.'To just sit there and pump water, that was my favorite time, frankly, on the island. Just talking. Just to have no distractions.' Flake and his sons filmed the experience and released a video of their travels afterward. For his third trip, Flake took a friend from across the aisle and an experienced camera crew to catch it all on camera. Rival Survival will air on the Discovery Channel on October 29 at 10 pm, six days before the mid-term elections. 'Whoever is going to lead the Senate going forward is going to do so with a very slim margin,' Flake told the Post. 'The parties are going to need to work together, so we wanted to get this out before the election, now’s a good time to show it.'","The one-episode series feature Arizona Republican Jeff Flake and New Mexico Democrat Martin Heinrich marooned in the Marshall Islands .

"A 12-year-old Texas boy has invented an app that transforms the power button of any Android phone into an alarm to call for help. Middle school student Dylan Puccetti, 12, says his app comes to life when the phone is locked and the owner hits the power button six times — presumably while in need of a discreet panic button during a dangerous situation. Dubbed 'SaveMePro,' the app sends a pre-written text message alerting of an imminent threat to one or several numbers programmed into it. 'If I was getting abducted and I have my . phone in my pocket, all I have to do is reach down and press the power . button,' Puccetti, of Gaveston, told KHOU. Young inventor: Dubbed 'SaveMePro,' the app developed by 12-year-old Dylan Puccetti (right) sends out distress signals at the touch of a power button . With a 99-cent upgrade, the app will also send out a map with GPS coordinates to its location. 'I hope it will save somebody's life,' Puccetti told KHOU. The station reported that Puccetti's inspiration comes from hearing about the story of Galveston County teenager Jessica Cain, who disappeared in 1997. 'She needed an emergency alert button,' Puccetti told KHOU. The app has been downloaded some 200 times since its launch on Aug. 1. 'I'm going to make sure all my children and . grandchildren have it on their phones,' wrote user Judi Christensen in a review of SaveMePro. The boy's father says this is Dylan's second patent. He also designed a device to help improve pitching skills in young baseball players while he was in fifth grade, according to the station. 'His mind is always going,' gushed the dad, Michael. 'He's always thinking of great stuff.' For now, the app is only available on Android.

"Dramatic images of the volcano Bardarbunga violently spewing lava and molton ash have emerged - suggesting that Iceland was quite right to ban all flights over the area. Craters spit out lava as molten rock flows into a river in the stunning images taken over the Holuhraun lava fields in the Icelandic highlands. The country's Met Office  issued a 'red alert' at the end of August after the Bardarbunga volcano, which lies underneath the Vatnajökull glacier, experienced a 'small' eruption. Craters spit out lava as molten rock flows into a river in the stunning images taken over the Holuhraun lava fields in the Icelandic highlands. The  Met Office issued a 'red alert' at the end of August after the Bardarbunga volcano, which lies underneath the Vatnajökull glacier, experienced a 'small' eruption. The dramatic pictures of the Holuhraun eruption were taken from an altitude of 50-500m at twilight and with the stunning Aurora Borealis in the background . Even though no volcanic ash was detected at the time, authorities took the unusual step of banning all flights in the airspace over the volcano. It was a move that echoed the Eyjafjallajokull ash cloud disaster which brought European air travel to a standstill for six days in 2010. More than 100,000 flights across Europe were cancelled when Eyjafjallajokull volcano spat ash some 30,000ft into the air, creating aviation chaos costing an estimated €1.26bn. Although the feared travel chaos has not materialised, new aerial photographs of the volcano in the Holuhraun lava field show that airlines were right to have been worried. The dramatic images suggest that Iceland was quite right to ban all flights over the airspace in the area due to safety concerns . Access to the volcano on foot is currently restricted because of the dangerous gases released from the eruption and the risk of flooding due to melting glaciers.

The teacher, a passenger in the vehicle driven by her daughter, had just finished speaking to her son, who was about to be deployed to Afghanistan with the military. The rock was dropped from an Interstate 80 overpass near Danville, Pennsylvania. Mrs Budd has undergone multiple surgeries, including removal of a portion of her facial bones to ease the brain swelling. Complications forced surgeons to remove a portion of her right frontal brain, her husband said. She also lost the use of her right eye.

"The 'Polar Vortex' has returned to the home of Mount Rushmore, blanketing the region with several inches of snow and marking the earliest winter storm in more than 120 years for South Dakota's second-largest city. The town of Custer, named after the Civil War general, received eight inches, while seven inches fell on the four presidential faces carved from the granite rock on Mount Rushmore. Nearby Rapid City got as much as two inches in its earliest snowfall since 1888. A vintage 1880 Train chugs through the snow-covered hills between Hill City and Keystone, South Dakota, on Thursday. For nearby Rapid City, it was the earliest snowfall since 1888. The previous record was just seven-tenths of an inch on September 13, 1970, according to the Argus Leader.

"The school district that includes Hershey, Pennsylvania, home of the U.S.'s largest chocolate maker, is urging parents to refrain from sending cupcakes and other sweets with their children on their birthdays. Derry Township School District is joining a host of districts around the country that have been pushing healthier alternatives since July when restrictions on the nutritional content of food sold in schools took effect as part of a federal law that aims to curb childhood obesity. Derry Township sent a letter to parents asking them to send items like pencils, pens and stickers instead of treats to mark special occasions. Derry Township School District joined the growing ranks of districts discouraging the consumption of cupcakes and other sweets to celebrate birthdays and other special occasions. Above, a child enjoys a cupcake in a stock photo . Superintendent Joseph McFarland said during a school board meeting on Monday that elementary school administrators tried to make a list of healthy snacks but found it difficult to decide what should be on it, according to PennLive.com. He added that district personnel didn't know what goes into making homemade treats. So instead they advised sharing pens and pencils or celebrate special days by doing something different such as wearing silly socks, McFarland said. Board member Andrea Abruzzo suggested a compromise: parents who wanted to send cupcakes could also throw in some fruit or carrots. The township, above, sent a letter to parents urging them to send pencils, pens and stickers with their children instead . Dan Tredinnick, director of school and community information with the district, said he and his colleagues were trying to encourage more non-food rewards, Fox 43 reported. 'We are not banning snacks, but we are steering folks who prefer to provide snacks, to do so as part of the four seasonal classroom parties each elementary room schedules,' he said. 'There's going to be no cupcake cops or anything like that. This is a collaboration with our community.' The new federal rules, included in the 2010 Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act championed by first lady Michelle Obama and her 'Let's Move!' campaign, only restrict food actually sold  in schools, including in vending machines, on snack carts and at daytime fundraisers, according to The Wall Street Journal. The law allowed for 'infrequent' fundraisers, and states could decide how many bake sales they would have that don't meet the standards. First lady Michelle Obama joins students at the food line to pick up lunch items at a school cafeteria in Alexandria, Virginia, in January. She has championed the federal rules that are leading more districts to restrict cupcakes and other sweets . Many districts are going behind the restrictions and targeting foods that aren't sold, like the much-loved birthday cupcake. 'We don't think that snacks are a bad thing,' Tredinnick said. 'We think that snacks have a place in everybody's diet, but food served in schools brings with a whole host of challenges. I think that there's other ways that we can collaboratively make kids feel special, and recognize their accomplishments, that don't necessarily have to involve food.' The district's wellness policy has been in place since 2008, but Tredinnick said that but growing problems like food allergies helped compel them to send the letter. Parents, many of whom recalled enjoying bringing cupcakes to school as children, had mixed reactions to the effort. Parent Kelsey Fox said she doesn't agree with the change but understands why it was made. 'We brought in donut holes. That was a big deal, going through Dunkin Donuts,' she said. 'While I would like to bring in baked goods and homemade things, I also understand that it's better to be safe.' Sarah Smith objected strongly to the change. 'I think it's ridiculous that kids can't bring in cupcakes and things like that,' she said. 'It's their birthday; they're going to do it at home, so why not be able to share it with all of the other kids at school.' At the board meeting on Monday, members acknowledged this will be an ongoing debate. 'It's a cultural issue in the community,' board member Chris Barrett said. 'The cupcake conundrum bears more discussion. There is a lot of confusion.'","Derry Township School District sent a letter to parents asking them not to send cupcakes and other sweets to mark students' birthdays .

"A former MasterChef contestant accused of embezzling over $7 million from his own mining company to fund 'a high-class lifestyle for himself and his girlfriends' has had the claims against him dropped in a private settlement. In April, a lawsuit claimed New York-based Australian playboy Aaron Thomas used company many for private jets, a luxury yacht and a $171,000 Tiffany engagement ring for his Brazilian fiancée. Thomas, 26, was sacked as CEO of London-based Oakmont Trading Ltd earlier this year after the board accused him of squandering millions of company money to fund his extravagant lifestyle, according to the lawsuit filed by the company in the Manhattan Supreme Court. A lawsuit against New York-based Australian playboy Aaron Thomas has been dropped . On Thursday, it emerged the case against Thomas - who appeared in the first season of the Channel 10 reality-cooking show in 2009 - had been listed as 'discontinued with prejudice' by the court. Thomas' lawyer Rob Garson told The New York Post the accused was satisfied that the 'vexatious and baseless allegations' had been dismissed. Thomas founded the mining company, which owns and operates a Brazilian iron ore mine, in 2010 and then proceeded to sell 74 percent of the company’s stock to investors, the suit stated. Thomas reportedly paid $14,500 a month for a Manhattan apartment where he lived with his fiancée Thaiana Rodrigues. Aaron Thomas, seen here with fiance Thaiana Rodrigues, appeared in the first season of MasterChef Australia in 2010 . The company launched legal action in both the UK and the US to recover an estimated $7m of company money. 'While Thomas has made some disclosures as to the whereabouts of the misappropriated funds, a sum of around [$2.5 million] remains unaccounted for,' the suit stated. The lawsuit featured numerous claims of Thomas' decadent spending, reports the New York Post. He is alleged to have spent $91,000 of company funds on a trip to Las Vegas in May 2013. Another $121,500 was apparently spent on designer watches by Rolex, and Hubot, and he even paid for 'many other flights taken by Thomas's girlfriends, including Rodrigues, in 2012 and 2013,' the suit claimed. Thomas said the lawsuit was an attempt by the board to get his remaining shares. As part of the recent confidential settlement, the 25 per cent stake in Oakmont which Thomas owned was sold back to the company.","Aaron Thomas, 26, appeared on MasterChef Australia in 2009 .

"On the run: Darren Burdfield has convictions for robbery, assault and Class A drug possession . A violent robber has become the third inmate in a week to go on the run from just one open prison. Darren Burdfield was allowed on  leave from Ford Open Prison, West Sussex, despite being jailed for five years last February for robbery, attempted robbery, criminal damage, assault, possession of an offensive weapon, Class A drug possession and various public order offences. The 32-year-old was recalled to jail on Saturday after a 'domestic incident' at the accommodation where he was staying for the weekend, but he did not return. He is now walking the streets and police have appealed for his return. Burdfield has become the 83rd inmate missing from Ford, which has been branded a laughing stock by campaigners with more than a dozen inmates missing since the 1990s. The record piles fresh embarrassment on Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, who has vowed to get to grips with lax security at Britain’s open prisons. He vanished just a day after Lucas Lamb walked out of Ford less than two years into a seven-year sentence for causing grievous bodily harm with intent. And on Monday, 27-year-old convicted burglar Greg Disbrey fled HMP Ford midway through a three-and-a-half year sentence he received in August 2012. The Category D prison holds 521 inmates, meaning the total who have absconded and not returned over the years are equal to almost a sixth of its capacity. Sussex Police said  Burdfield was allowed out of HMP Ford on Friday, but was recalled to prison less than 24 hours later following a 'domestic incident' in Worthing, West Sussex. The offender is 5ft 10ins tall with black hair and  tattoos of swallows on each side of his neck. Chief Inspector Pip Taylor, who is leading the manhunt, said: 'Burdfield has a large number of friends and associates across Sussex so it is possible that he is in the county still. Laughing stock:  83 inmates are  missing from HMP Ford in Arundel, West Sussex, including three this week . Missing: Violent criminal Lucas Lamb (left) and burglar Greg Disbrey (right) have both left Ford in the last week . 'We need to speak to anyone who may have seen him or may know where he is. 'There is nothing to suggest he poses a risk to the general public but he has not served his sentence so we need to arrest him and return him to custody as quickly as possible.” Sussex Police has set up a dedicated team to track down Ford absconders, one of whom has been missing since the early 1960s. Those missing include two murderers, a kidnapper and five other violent criminals. About half have been missing for at least four years, and 18 escaped in the 1990s.","Darren Burdfield has convictions for robbery, assault and Class A drugs .

"Parents have removed their children from a primary school after the governors banned packed lunches. At least six children have been taken away from Milefield Primary School in Barnsley because of its strict new policy which aims to have all pupils eating a freshly cooked school dinner. The change follows new rules, championed by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, which force schools to provide a free hot lunch to infants aged four  to seven. Scroll down for video . Unhappy: The Martin family, who protested over the move. Adam, 31, and Claire, 30, have now taken their three children - Harry, four, George, five and Amelia, seven - out of the school and moved them elsewhere . New rules: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has introduced compulsory hot meals for all four- to seven-year-olds . Decision: Milefield Primary School in Grimethorpe, South Yorkshire, told parents of the policy in a letter sent home on the last day of term in July - and it was implemented upon the children's return last Friday . Milefield Primary decided to offer the hot lunch to all pupils, charging those aged over seven £1.75 a day. Children who don’t want the school dinner can be collected and taken home for lunch. But some families are upset that packed lunches, often cheaper to prepare, have been banned. They fear fussy children will end up going without as the school only offers one choice of meal. Parents were told about the meal policy in a letter from the headmistress on the last day of term in July. Paula Murray has said she is proud of the change, which has been backed by a majority of parents. But Adam Martin, 31, has taken his children Harry, four, George, five, and Amelia, seven, out of the school over the dispute. Angry at the decision: IT consultant Mick Curphey, 39, and his wife Debbie, 37, have kept their children - William, eight, and Beth, seven - in school because they do not want to disrupt their education . Defence: Milefield Primary School - rated 'good' by Ofsted inspectors - has stood by its decision to ban pack lunches - and headteacher Paula Murray said it was 'encouraging the promotion of healthy eating' Mr Martin, a gas engineer, said: ‘I feel like our freedom of choice has been taken away. We were appalled to be told our children couldn’t take in packed lunches and further incensed with how the school have dealt with the situation. 'We like our kids to have a packed lunch because, not only does it save us money, but it also allows you to let your children eat what they like.’ He added: ‘The packed lunches we make are healthy, we don’t  need somebody to tell us what our children should be eating.’ His attempts to communicate with education authorities over the summer had failed, he said. Parents who had hoped to discuss the meal policy with teachers on the first day of term were met by two police community support officers. Mr Martin said he had allowed his two sons to have the school dinner but sent his daughter with her usual packed lunch. He then received a phone call from the school asking what she was going to eat, as her packed lunch had been confiscated. ‘Maybe the school meal is good value but when your child doesn’t want to eat any of it then it’s too expensive,’ Mr Martin said. He said his children’s new school offers five different meal choices and allows packed lunches. A spokesman for Barnsley council said six children from three families had so far been removed from the school. Notification: A letter sent from Milefield Primary School in July outlining the banning of packed lunches . Explained: The headteacher can decide where pupils should be allowed to bring a packed lunch to school . Q&A: The answer to Question 7 explains what parents should do if they want to give their child home dinners . Headmistress Mrs Murray said no one was being ‘forced’ to participate as parents could take their children home for lunch if they chose. She claimed the cooked lunch policy was having a ‘positive impact’. ‘We’re encouraging the promotion of healthy eating,’ she said. ‘We have to work towards what’s best for a large proportion of children in the school – over 97 per cent of parents are in favour of the changes.’ The Government has set aside £1billion over the next two years to cover the cost of the hot meals, which will be provided to all pupils without any means testing. 'Debt policy': This letter from the school says court action can be pursued if school meals are not paid for . Options: On the first day back at school Mr and Mrs Martin took their children to school, leaving Harry and George to have a cooked school dinner - and Amelia went with her packed lunch .","Milefield Primary School in South Yorkshire wrote to parents with policy .

"Tragedy: This is where Lee Tien fell to her death . This photograph shows the last image of a teenage Chinese girl who killed herself rather than face life without her own mobile phone. The parents of 13-year-old Lee Tien had been unhappy about the amount of time she spent on her mobile phone, which culminated on the day she died in a furious row with her parents. The family refused to comment on the matter, but neighbours told local TV they had heard the pair arguing about the fact that she was always on the phone, and that the teenager was unhappy when her phone was taken off her to teach her to be more disciplined. Neighbour Chan Juan Lai, 55, said: 'She was such a sweet girl, and very obedient. Who would not have thought she would take her own life over something so unimportant.' But devastated at the loss of the device, she had instead thrown herself from the front room window of the 11th floor flat in the city of Chengdu, in Sichuan Province, in southwest China. Resident Chen Jutian, 34, spotted the girl lying face up on the ground and immediately reported the incident to the police. Medics who attended confirmed that the teenager was dead. He said: 'I saw that she wasn't moving and feared the worst, which was confirmed when the medics arrived.'

"A woman who suffered from crippling endometriosis and was given an ultimatum to either lose weight or sacrifice her womb is now trying for a baby now she has lost 13st. Doctors told Laura McCullough, 30, that the only way to cure the  ill health she had experienced since her teenage years was to lose weight through bariatric surgery, or undergo a full hysterectomy which would leave her infertile. After making the agonising decision to go under the knife, the symptoms of Mrs McCullough's endometriosis eased and she is now having IVF treatment in the hope of falling pregnant. Scroll down for video . Laura McCullough, who suffered from crippling endometriosis and was given an ultimatum to either lose weight or sacrifice her womb, is now trying for a baby now she has lost 13st . Laura has dropped from 26st 7lb and a size 28 (left) to 13st 7lb and a size 12 (right) after bariatric surgery . Mrs McCullough, of Worthing, West Sussex said: 'Since a young age I knew I'd always wanted kids. 'On the other hand, the symptoms of my endometriosis were getting steadily worse. My health was failing and I was so miserable because of the pain that I was having suicidal thoughts. 'I told the doctors: ""you've got to do something, I can't go on like this"". 'The choice was quite clear - either to have a hysterectomy and give up the chance of having children, or go for weight loss surgery, which I was told would make the symptoms easier to deal with. 'I didn't know what weight loss surgery entailed but I knew I didn't want to give up the possibility of children.' Mrs McCullough, a nanny, was diagnosed with endometriosis and polycystic ovary syndrome when she was 17 years old after years of pain, disrupted periods and weight gain. She said: 'My sister Claire, who is two years younger than me, is exactly the same in nearly every way but we looked so different. We ate the same food when we were children but whereas Claire could eat four burgers in one go and still stay a size six, I just put on more and more weight. 'My periods were sporadic and always agonising. Sometimes they lasted for six months at a time and then would disappear for a year. At one point I had a period which lasted a year and a half. Nothing could stop it. Laura made the decision to undergo weight loss surgery when doctors told her her only other choice was to have a total hysterectomy (pictured before her surgery left, and today right) 'I had anaemia and an enormous amount of pain. It was depressing and lonely. I couldn't get out of bed to do anything. The only thing I could do was go to the loo, and even that was next to impossible. 'None of my other friends were bed-bound when they were on their periods. At 17 I knew I needed to see a doctor about it.' Laura (left) sister Claire would eat similar foods but Laura's condition meant she put on weight more easily . Due to a combination of the weight-gaining effects of polycystic ovary syndrome and endometriosis, and long periods of inactivity caused by the pain she experienced, Mrs McCullough saw her weight balloon to 26st 7lb by the time she was 25 years old. Laura, pictured with her nephew Reece, and niece Ruby-Rose, always knew she wanted children one day . She said: 'Weight loss wasn't my priority - there were so many other health problems I was contending with, and I knew that my personality wasn't defined by my size. 'I was told that the pain and other symptoms would be easier to manage if I lost weight, so I tried dieting and taking prescribed medication to stop the gain but nothing worked.' By January 2009 Mrs McCullough's pain was worse than ever and she was severely depressed. She said: 'I'd become suicidal because there didn't seem to be a way out of the cycle of pain. I begged my doctor to do something. 'She said I could either have weight loss surgery or have my womb removed completely. I hadn't considered weight loss surgery for a moment. But then I did some research online and read case studies of women whose endometriosis had improved enormously after the surgery. Laura met her partner Chrissy McCullough, 23, an ambulance technician, after her weight loss surgery . 'I went back the next day and told the doctor that although I was nervous about it, I wanted to go ahead with it.' Mrs McCullough went under the knife in June that year. She said: 'I was so nervous the night before the surgery that I didn't sleep a wink. Unfortunately, the procedure didn't go as planned. I couldn't keep any food down after I was discharged from hospital so I went back in, and was told my body had rejected the procedure. 'I stayed in hospital for six weeks, during which time I was very unwell, but I pulled through and I slowly got used to it. Laura, pictured on her wedding day, noticed her symptoms reduced almost as soon as she had lost weight . Laura and Chrissy, pictured on their wedding day, have now started IVF in the hopes of starting a family . 'Once I'd recovered, I realised that all the symptoms of my endometriosis had stopped completely. It was as if someone had flipped a switch. 'I was over the moon when I realised I'd made the right decision and I didn't need to worry about having a hysterectomy any longer.' Three years after the procedure, Mrs McCullough had dropped down 13st, shrinking from a size 28 to a size 12. She met her partner Chrissy McCullough, 23, an ambulance technician, who she would go on to marry in November 2013. The NHS explains: 'Endometriosis is a common condition where tissue that behaves like the lining of the womb (the endometrium) is found outside the womb. These pieces of tissue can be found in many different areas of the body, but they are most commonly found on the ovaries, on the lining of the pelvis behind the uterus and covering the top of the vagina. The condition is estimated to affect around two million women in the UK. Most of them are diagnosed between the ages of 25 and 40. Endometriosis is a long-term (chronic) condition that causes painful periods or heavy periods. It often also causes pain in the lower abdomen (tummy), pelvis or lower back, as well as fertility problems. It may also contribute towards a lack of energy and depression. However, the symptoms of endometriosis can vary significantly and some women have few symptoms or no symptoms at all. You should see your GP if you have symptoms of endometriosis so they can try to identify a cause.' Source: NHS.co.uk . She said: 'It was the perfect winter wedding - just as we'd both dreamed of. I looked in the mirror and couldn't believe how slim and pretty I looked in my wedding dress. It was a magical day.' Shortly after the wedding, the couple turned their thoughts to having children via IVF and sperm donation. Mrs McCullough said: 'We couldn't have funding for IVF on the NHS because there is no such facility to do so for same-sex couples in Worthing. I think the postcode lottery is very unfair, but we were determined enough to have the treatment privately. 'Unfortunately the first round of IVF led to the return of the endometriosis, so we're waiting on some more consultations and tests before we can try again. But we're never going to give up - having a family is our dream. 'If it wasn't for the weight loss surgery, I would have been forced to have the hysterectomy and we wouldn't even be able to consider it, so I have that to be thankful for.' Mrs McCullough is now hoping to raise awareness of endometriosis, a condition which affects as many as two million women in the UK. She has found support at the Facebook group EndometrioSisters, which has more than 2,200 members. She said: 'It's very common but even close friends of mine don't know exactly what it is. It should be talked about more openly because it affects so many lives.'

"A husband and father of three officially has the World's Widest Tongue, according to Guinness World Records. Byron Schlenker, 46, told Syracuse.com his daughter examined the width of his tongue, after she saw the previous record listed in a copy of the Guinness Book of World Records from 2012. Schlenker's tongue is 8.3cm wide - beating the record of 7.9cm, the website reported. Amazing! Byron Schlenker broke the Guinness World Record for the world's widest tongue . It's official! Schlenker and his tongue are seen inside the new edition of the Guinness Book of World Records . Schlenker told Syracuse.com he contacted Guinness, which said he was able give money for a company employee to examine his tongue in-person - but 'just let it go and forgot about the whole thing' after discovering he was able to submit pictures himself. Guinness later reached out to Schlenker and used 'a doctor and two notaries to measure his tongue using a hard, metal ruler,' according to the website. 'I would have never done it if they hadn't contacted me back,' Schlenker told Syracuse.com. 'It wasn't something I'm striving for. I don't mind if someone beats my record or not.' Speaking of his photo shoot, Schlenker told the website 'They had me licking ice cream cones and they lined up Tic Tacs across my tongue. Strange encounters: Schlenker says people who know of his tongue have asked them to lick their books . 'I had to stick out my tongue for three hours. It's a muscle like anything else, and can get bigger. If I measure, my tongue now, it's about 8.6 cm.' He told KEYE, saying 'People get excited and sometimes it catches you off guard. They're like, ""Can you lick my book?"" I'm like, ""I'm not licking anything."" But it's just fun.' Schlenker told MailOnline he saw his picture inside the book for the first time during a recent shopping trip to Target with his daughter. Schlenker told MailOnline he did not spread the news he broke the Guinness World Record until the book was published, because the company told him people would likely come forward and try to one-up him. He also said he didn't initially believe Guinness when he was told the media would eventually reach out and be interested in his story. 'I said, ""I hadn't seen anybody do anything with their tongues besides Miley Cyrus and Gene Simmons,""' Schlenker said. Schlenker said he agreed with commenters on the Syracuse.com story, who have been alternately grossed out and shocked by his tongue. 'I have to agree with them; it is gross,' he told MailOnline. 'But it is funny at the same time.' Schlenker said his wife 'wasn't on board 'til Guinness [offered] to fly me to Rome for a TV special.' 'Other than that, [she thinks] this is kind of weird,' he told MailOnline. His daughters, however, think it is 'hysterical.'","Byron Schlenker, a husband and father of three, broke the Guinness World Record for the World's Widest Tongue .

"Cyclists may be allowed to run red lights and cars banned from entering bike lanes in an attempt to make roads more bike-friendly and reduce conflict with motorists. The measures are part of a number of reforms being considered by the Victorian government in a bid to get more cyclists on the road. VicRoads is expected to release a report of a possible overhaul of Victoria's road rules by the end of the year and have already started looking at results from an online survey that asked for feedback on cycling road rules. Cyclists may be allowed to run red lights and cars banned from entering bike lanes in an attempt by the Victorian government to make roads more bike-friendly and reduce conflict with motorists . Among the options being considered is allowing cyclists to treat red lights as give way signs, the Herald Sun reports. Banning cyclists' use of headphones and requiring motorists to be one metre away from cyclists are also on the radar. Under current road rules, cyclists must stop at traffic lights and face the same penalties as motorists if they run a red light. Vehicles may also be banned from entering bike lanes under the potential reforms. At the moment they can drive in bike lanes to park or make a turn for up to 50 metres. VicRoads is expected to release a report of a possible overhaul of Victoria's road rules by the end of the year . Victoria's reforms on road rules comes as a young women was killed at a cyclist 'danger zone' in Brisbane on Thursday. Brisbane CIty Council was warned a number of times about the area before the 22-year-old cyclist was involved in a collision with a truck at the corner of Stanley Street and Annerley Road in South Brisbane. She was stopped at a red light when she was hit by a semi trailer trailer that was travelling in the same direction. Cycling group cycle.org.au have contacted the council in writing and in person since July warning that the area was 'a disaster waiting to happen' for cyclists, the Brisbane Times reports. Banning cyclists' use of headphones and requiring motorists to be one metre away from cyclists are also on the radar . While the council conducted a road safety review of the area and cut back overgrown vegetation, replaced signs and repainted existing bikes lanes, cycle.org.au Queensland director Stephen Mitchell said he was disappointed by the lack of real change. 'What does happen in Brisbane City Council is that they go to their own internal sources and refer to a manual and create lines on a road that don't improve protection or safety for cyclists in any way, shape or form,' Mr Mitchell said. 'I don't even know if what is there [at Annerley] is much of a bikeway.' Vehicles may also be banned from entering bike lanes under the potential reforms. At the moment they can drive in bike lanes to park or make a turn for up to 50 metres . 'Police Inspector Rob Graham urged drivers to be considerate of other road users at the scene of the crash on Thursday. 'It's tragic circumstances. And it just highlights to me the important need for the shared space on the roadway for all traffic, pedestrians, bikes, cars and trucks,' he said.","Victorian government is considering a number of reforms to make roads more bike-friendly and reduce conflict with motorists .

"A young woman suffered two strokes and was left partially paralysed before turning 22 - the second attack coming a year to the day after the first. Lauren Bradfield mistook the signs of the first deadly brain bleed, a blinding headache and dizziness, for a hangover. At the age of just 20, she was left paralysed down her left side, from her neck to her feet and told by doctors she may never walk again. After three months in hospital and intensive treatment, in September last year - a year to the day after Miss Bradfield suffered her first stroke - she collapsed the victim of a second at the age of 21. Less than a year on from that attack, which left her unable to move the left side of her body, Miss Bradfield has made a 'miraculous recovery' learning to walk again and take part in a 10k run. Lauren Bradfield, 22, was left partially paralysed twice before her 22nd birthday, after suffering two strokes, the second exactly a year after the first . At just 20-years old, Miss Bradfield was told she would never walk again after suffering a bleed in her brain . About a quarter of strokes in the UK occur in people under 65 years, according to The Stroke Association. Miss Bradfield said being able to defy expectation was a great feeling after the shattering experience of being told she would never walk again - twice. She said: 'Everyone has been totally shocked at how far I've come since my first stroke. 'Being told twice that I may never walk again was a horrendous experience. 'I am still very early on in my recovery and at times it feels like I am 92 rather than 22 but doctors have been astounded that I've proved them wrong. 'I am just grateful that I am still alive, let alone being able to run races.' Miss Bradfield, a lab assistant, suffered her first stroke aged 20 in 2012 - when she mistook the symptoms for a hangover. But after a blinding headache gave way to dizziness and being unable to stand, she realised something was more seriously wrong. A scan found a bleed on her brain and she was immediately admitted to a neurological unit for round-the-clock care. A stroke is a brain attack. It happens when the blood supply to part of your brain is cut off. It can be caused by a blockage in one of the blood vessels leading to the brain or a bleed in the brain. Blood carries essential nutrients and oxygen to your brain. Without blood your brain cells can be damaged or destroyed. Strokes affect people in different ways, depending on the part of the brain that is affected, how widespread the damage is and how healthy the person was before the stroke. A stroke can affect the way your body functions as well as your thought processes and how you feel and communicate. A stroke can also have an emotional impact and can cause problems such as anxiety, depression or changes to your personality. What causes a stroke? Most strokes happen when a blood clot blocks the flow of blood to your brain. Blood clots usually form in areas where the arteries have become narrowed or ‘furred’ up by fatty deposits. This is called atheroscelrosis. As we age our arteries become harder and narrower. However, certain medical conditions and lifestyle factors can speed up this process and increase your risk of having a stroke. Medical problems like diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol can increase your risk of having a stroke. Lifestyle factors, such as diet, drinking alcohol, taking drugs, smoking and how active you are, can also increase your risk. Source: The Stroke Association . After suffering the massive stroke, Miss Bradfield was left completely unable to move her left side from the neck downwards. She said: 'I was stunned - I didn't think that people my age had strokes. 'I got a headache when I was out on a day trip where I had a few drinks, but I didn't think anything of it, I assumed it was just the heat or the alcohol. 'But when this got worse the next day, I found it difficult to stand up and knew something was seriously wrong. 'After my stroke, the next week was a bit of a blur, I was unable to move which was terrifying.' Miss Bradfield was then sent for another round of tests which revealed two major blood clots on her brain. It was then she was told by doctors that she may never walk again. She was in such a critical condition she was moved to a neurological rehabilitation unit. Determined to get her life back on track, Miss Bradfield spent three months in hospital. She said: 'I was terrified, but I wasn't going to give up that easily. 'They weren't sure of the prognosis at the time and a part of it was just a waiting game but thanks to the amazing doctors and nurses who picked up on this, eventually it did save my life. 'It was a life or death situation because the drugs they used were meant to prevent more clots but at the same time could have made the bleed worse which could have been fatal.' However, in September 2013, a year to the day after her first stroke, Miss Bradfield collapsed unexpectedly . Once again she was left partially paralysed down her left side. She was told for a second time she may never be able to walk again, and plagued by the thought of reliving the harrowing ordeal, she broke down in tears. But remarkably, Miss Bradfield, whose family has a significant history of blood clots, made a rapid recovery and was only in hospital for two weeks before she returned home. After a couple of months of intensive rehab she was finally able to walk again without aid. She said: 'It was hard to see my friends graduate and look at their pictures all over Facebook when I was helpless. 'They were able to get on with their lives when I felt stuck and trapped. 'It has made me realise that life can be taken away from you at any point and so unexpectedly so it really is important to make the most of every second, because life is too short.' Miss Bradfield collapsed a year to the day after her first stroke, in September 2013, the victim of a second attack aged just 21 . Miss Bradfield's family have a history of blood clots, which can cause stroke if they block the blood supply to the brain. She credits her family with her quick recovery after her second stroke . Fully recovered after months of intense rehab, Miss Bradfield is now able to go to work, play hockey and even ran a 10k race to raise money for The Stroke Association . The causes of Miss Bradfield's strokes are unknown, but she now has to take blood thinning tablets for life to keep the symptoms under control. But having raised £700 for The Stroke Association by running the London Bupa 10,000, she is determined to keep her strokes at bay and continue to lead an active life. 'I am back to working full time and playing hockey so things really are getting back on track and I am grateful to so many people for this,' she added. Nikki Hill, deputy director of external affairs at the Stroke Association, said: 'A stroke is all too often thought of as a condition that only affects older people, but the condition can happen to anyone at any age. 'A stroke is a brain attack it happens when the blood supply to part of your brain is cut off by a bleed or a blood clot. 'It is relatively rare to have a stroke under the age of 25, but a quarter of strokes occur in people under 65 years old. 'We know that lifestyle factors, such as a lack of exercise, and a poor diet, are leading to an increase in obesity and diabetes - both important risk factors for stroke. 'The progress we've made in reducing stroke incidence will be lost unless people take control of their health and reduce their risk of stroke.'","Lauren Bradfield, now 22, suffered her first stroke aged just 20 .

"Rapper Chris Brown's entourage got into a bottle-throwing fight with a nearby group at New York nightclub, according to a police source . Rapper Chris Brown's entourage got into a bottle-throwing brawl with a nearby group at a New York nightclub, according to a police source. The alleged incident took place last night at the Meatpacking District’s VIP Room where Brown was hosting a New York Fashion Week after-party. One man who was hit by flying glass is in a stable condition with a serious eye injury at Beth Israel Hospital, the source said, according to the New York Daily News. Police, who arrived at the club at 3:20am, are investigating the incident, but there are no immediate arrests. Law enforcement sources told TMZ that they are not sure the 25-year-old singer was directly involved, but a witness told the website Brown was in a VIP section of the club when the brawl broke out. Two years ago Brown was directly involved in a similar brawl with Drake and his crew at W.i.P. Nightclub in NYC thought to be over popstar Rihanna. Last month music mogul Suge Knight was shot at a pre-VMA party hosted by Chris Brown at an LA nightclub. The 49-year-old was treated for six shotgun wounds at hospital and two others, including 19-year-old model Megan Hawkins, were also shot - all three were rushed to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Earlier this month Brown pleaded guilty to punching a man in the face outside a Washington hotel, an assault that occurred while the singer was on probation for attacking his then-girlfriend Rihanna. Brown pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault and was sentenced to time served. He spent two days in a District of Columbia jail in the case, one that further tarnished the image of the Grammy-winning singer. Brown admitted that he hit a man who tried to get in a picture the singer was taking with two women outside the W hotel a few blocks from the White House last October. Scroll down for video .

The victim, Parker Adams, suffered a broken nose. At the time of the arrest, Brown was on probation in a felony assault case for attacking pop star Rihanna hours before the 2009 Grammy awards. The arrest led a judge in California to revoke his probation, and he was ordered in May to serve an additional 131 days in jail. Earlier this month (pictured) Brown pleaded guilty to punching a man in the face outside a Washington hotel, an assault that occurred while the singer was on probation for attacking his then-girlfriend Rihanna .

Parker Adams in a shot taken just after he was hit by alleged attackers Brown and his bodyguard . Brown had a squeaky-clean image before his attack on Rihanna, but since then he has had several flare-ups that have been reported to authorities and noted by Los Angeles prosecutors. Brown broke a window after a 2011 'Good Morning America' interview in New York and was accused of snatching a woman's cellphone in Miami after she tried to snap pictures of the singer. He was also slightly injured in a New York nightclub brawl and, earlier this year, was accused of being involved in a fistfight with Frank Ocean's entourage over a parking spot at a West Hollywood recording studio. He was not charged in any of the incidents, but they have hurt his public standing. Nonetheless, legions of fans, including many of his more than 13 million Twitter followers, continue to support him. Following the hearing, he tweeted '#XTheAlbum,' a reference to his new recording, due out Sept. 16. Onorato said his client has learned to 'be more judicious' in his dealings with the public. Brown's bodyguard, Christopher Hollosy, was convicted of misdemeanor assault in April for his role in the same scuffle. He has not yet been sentenced. The victim, Adams, has also filed a $1.5 million lawsuit against Brown and Hollosy. Two years ago Brown was directly involved in a similar brawl with Drake and his crew at W.i.P.

"Proud Australian produce purchasers would have had a difficult time buying asparagus from one local Woolworths recently, after the supermarket giant displayed a puzzling label. James Anderson, from Turbo Productions, took a snap of the confusing tag at his local Woolworth in Docklands, Victoria, to share his disappointment that the supermarket wasn't sourcing its asparagus from nearby local growers. A Woolworths spokesperson explained to Daily Mail Australia that in the case of asparagus, the vegetable is sourced from Australian sources when it is in season – from September through to March. At other points of the year, it is imported from Peru and Mexico. 'Am I buying Australian produce?': This vague label was displayed at a Woolworths in Docklands, Victoria . However a spokesperson from the Australian Made Campaign Limited, Ben Lazzaro, dubbed the label too vague and said it was simply 'not good enough'. 'Consumers need confidence that they're buying the product from either Australia or elsewhere and it should be clearly labelled as such,' he said. Mr Lazzaro admitted that generally, supermarkets provide a majority of Australian grown products in their fresh produce section. 'The major supermarkets – Coles, Woolworth and even Aldi - around 95 per cent of what they stock in their fresh food produce is Australian grown,' he said. Woolworths has placed a table on their website which informs viewers where their fruit and vegetables are sourced from: About 95 per cent of what major supermarkets stock in fresh food is Australian grown . 'They cop a lot of heat for that five per cent, but it is generally due to seasonality and often the product literally just cannot be sourced. 'Although we want to eat Aussie all year round, there are some unavoidable realities we have to put up with.' Instead, Mr Lazzaro said the real challenge presents itself in the labelling of processed and packaged food, which is often vaguely stamped with the words 'made from local and imported ingredients'. The most common products that stump shoppers as to their origins include canned tomatoes –which often have imported ingredients from Italy or China – and baked beans – often sourced from South America . The two common products that he identified as stumping shoppers as to their origins include canned tomatoes – which often have imported ingredients from Italy or China – and baked beans – where the beans are often sourced from South American countries. Mr Lazzaro suggested that consumers keen to support Australian local businesses should look out for the green and gold triangular kangaroo symbol which remains the only means tested way to guarantee a product is produced locally. Supermarkets could also do more to specify which products were Australian made by designating section in isles or using signs and labels to call out where the local options can be found, he said.","Woolworths in Docklands, Victoria, labelled its asparagus with a sign reading 'Product of Australia or Peru or Mexico'

"Motorists in the capital could soon find themselves forced to pay for each mile they drive under radical new air quality proposals by Mayor of London Boris Johnson. Mr Johnson's plans would see fuel duty and road tax replaced with a charge of access to roads, but with discounts available for low-emission vehicles. The proposals are part of an attempt to reduce the number of premature deaths caused by diesel engine pollution. Mayor of London Boris Johnson (pictured) is calling for new road charges in a bid to improve air quality, with discounts available for low-emission vehicles . Mr Johnson says the plans would need to be supported by central Government and EU action and funding. The proposals are part of a report released by the mayor's office yesterday and posted on the Travel for London website. Mr Johnson says more radical measures such as this may be needed to bring forward the date of compliance for NO2 emissions and to significantly tackle vehicle emission levels. The proposals were released on the same day Mr Johnson called for all diesel cars which are more than a year old to be scrapped because their fumes harm people's health. He wants the Government to pay the owners between £1,000 and £2,000 in a national scrappage scheme. He added millions were unfairly ‘seduced’ into buying diesel by being told it was greener. Scientists believe diesel produces more of the tiny particles and nitrogen oxides that damage human health. It is now known that diesel fumes create a variety of long-term problems for the heart and lungs, particularly in children. Mr Johnson has also announced moves to discourage diesel cars in the capital, with all diesel drivers being charged an extra £10 to drive into central London . Senior scientists have even blamed diesel for directly causing the deaths of 7,000 people in Britain every year. Earlier in the year Mr Johnson, who drives a petrol Toyota people carrier, announced moves to discourage diesel cars in the capital. In July he revealed plans for almost all diesel vehicle drivers to be charged an extra £10 to drive into Central London as part of a new ultra-low emissions zone from 2020. The proposals aim to reduce air pollution - like this smog pictured in London's East End earlier this year . Other cities across the country are also considering a charge as they urgently look at ways to cut diesel fumes to comply with EU clean air rules. Around 29,000 deaths a year are linked to air pollution in Britain. Britain is facing £300 million in European Commission fines for repeatedly failing to reduce levels of nitrogen dioxide air pollution . Strict targets should have been met by January 2010 and in February this year the EU launched legal proceedings to force the Government to deal with air pollution. In the report, Mr Johnson said: 'London’s air is no longer clogged with the industrial effluent that caused its infamous pea-soupers, and I am proud to say we have made great progress through the most ambitious and comprehensive set of measures to improve air quality this city has ever seen. 'The aim is simple – to keep improving quality of life and make London’s air the cleanest of any major world city. 'Improving London’s air quality is an urgent challenge - it affects the health and well-being of all Londoners, and it simply cannot be put on hold.' The proposals aim to reduce air pollution - like this smog pictured in London's East End earlier this year .","Mayor's plan would see fuel duty and road tax replaced with charge to use roads .

"Marriya Wright, 34, stepped down from her position in Spokane County, Washington on Wednesday . A married deputy prosecutor has resigned from her job after she allegedly had an improper relationship with a jail inmate. Marriya Wright, 34, stepped down from her position in Spokane County, Washington on Wednesday after court document released details of her alleged relationship with 31-year-old Matthew Baumrucker. The pair allegedly exchanged more than 1,200 text messages and phone calls in a month including one picture of Mrs Wright wearing a bikini. Baumrucker, who has 'criminal' tattooed on his forehead and words 'West Side' above his eyebrows, along with others, was facing drug and assault charges earlier this year. Under his eyes, he appears to have the word 'Hoover' and 'Crips' which could refer to a Washington gang '74 Hoover Crips'. The relationship came to light in March after police sought out Baumrucker in connection with an assault. A witness later told police that Baumrucker called someone and said: 'Marriya, the police are chasing me...' She apparently gave him advice on search warrants and went to meet him at a gas station - the incident which may have her facing charges of rendering criminal assistance, according to Oregon Live. Mrs Wright had been on administrative leave since April while under suspicion of rendering criminal assistance. According to spokesman.com, she made $83,000 last year. Matthew Baumrucker allegedly had an improper relationship with Mrs Wright. He is on prison awaiting a federal weapons charge . According to an online employment profile, Mrs Wright is married to Scott Wright, a Department of Corrections officer in Washington state. The couple recently adopted a child and are in the process of adopting a second. Her defense attorney Chris Bugbee told OregonLive that Mrs Wright overlooked Baumrucker's tattoos, was 'trying to save his soul' and bring him into the church. MailOnline was awaiting a comment from Mr Bugbee today. Wright visited Baumrucker in jail several times in the attorney-client booth but she was not working on his cases. According to KREM, on one occasion, a jail officer spotted Baumrucker with a picture of Mrs Wright wearing a bikini. Baumrucker wrote to the TV station in August and said their relationship was 'above and beyond what anyone could have ever imagined'. State charges against Baumrucker were dropped on August 15 but he is still facing a federal charge of felon in possession of a firearm for allegedly having a semi-automatic gun. He remains in jail until his trial next month. The FBI is now investigating to see if Wright may have compromised any other investigations. No criminal charges have been filed against her.

"The female relative  who said she was sexually assaulted by accused murderer Lian Bin 'Robert' Xie told court that she didn't want to pursue the allegations. The young woman, who cannot be named, told NSW Supreme Court on Thursday that she believed he was 'completely innocent' of the alleged murders of five members of the Lin Family and didn't want to destroy her relationship with Mr Xie's wife Kathy. Mr Xie is accused of murdering his brother-in-law Min 'Norman' Lin,  wife Lily Lin, their young sons Henry and Terry and Lily's sister, Irene Lin with a hammer-like weapon as they slept in the early hours of their North Epping home in Sydney's northwest on July 18, 2009. The woman told court that in the years leading up to the murders, there had been a number of 'uncomfortable' behaviours with Mr Xie, which he inappropriately touched her. Scroll down for video . Lian Bin ""Robert"" Xie is escorted to a prison transport vehicle as he leaves the NSW Supreme Court in Sydney on Wednesday. The man is accused of murdering five members of the Lin family in their North Epping home in Sydney in July 2009 . The court heard the woman texted Mr Xie's solicitor Kara Greiner saying: 'I have information that could potentially change the crown case and destroy part of the defence case.' But following a meeting with Ms Greiner in May, she had a change of mind and told the lawyer she wouldn't pursue the abuse allegations further. 'I still believe Robert is completely innocent,' the young female texted after the meeting. 'I'm still willing to do everything to help him, everything ... I'm always 100 per cent supporting Robert.' But days later, she had a further change of heart after speaking to a close friend and a counsellor. 'I thought, what if he really is guilty (of the murders). He is not someone I would want to live with Kathy,' she told the court. 'Because I didn't have enough evidence to make that judgement I can only tell the court what I know.' It was reported that the young woman came to live with Mr Xie and his wife in their Epping home, before he allegedly began coming into her room at night, according to Sydney Morning Herald. 'I'm a pretty light sleeper so when he came in, I think I woke up ... but I had my eyes closed,' the young woman said. 'He put his hand under my pyjamas and under my underwear and just kept it there for a few moments ... just above my vagina. Then he got up and left.' She said she stayed silent about the abuse because she didn't want to 'crush' Xie's wife Kathy. 'I knew it would destroy my relationship with her.' She said in one incident at Mr Xie's family home, they were sitting on the couch when he began rubbing his hands up and down her thigh. When she stood up, he repeated this action on her torso while taking 'longer breaths'. 'I felt it wasn't very right but I wasn't sure what to think,' she said. After the murders, she told the court that his behaviour intensified.

'But when it happened again, I knew I wasn't crazy.' The relative continued: 'It would stop for two weeks or three and I would think, 'Oh God, it's over'... but then it would start again.' She said she didn't tell anyone about it at the time. 'I think I just felt really embarrassed,' she explained.

"Customer Graham Tisdale, 60, wrestled a bag of stolen jewellery from a masked gang of robbers after they broke into a shop in Birmingham . A quick-thinking customer bravely wrestled a £50,000 bag of stolen jewellery from a gang of armed robbers - but says he now wonders whether he could have done more. Graham Tisdale, from Burton-on-Trent, was shopping with his family in Selective Gold, Birmingham, when a masked gang of smash-and-grab robbers burst into the store. The robbers packed £80,000 worth of jewellery into two large bags in a raid which took just 48 seconds. But the 60-year-old heroically grabbed one of the bags back from the robbers as they fled the shop. The grandfather said he sprung into action after hearing shop owner John Davis plead with the masked gang. But despite the bag containing £50,000 worth of jewellery, the modest have-a-go hero still wonders if he could have done more to stop the thieves. Mr Tisdale said: . 'When John told them, ""you might as well hit me, you’re going to kill me . by taking my business"", it hit a nerve, seeing his stress. 'This . was happening to someone who has been very good to us. It wasn’t . premediated. The opportunity arose and I took that opportunity. Scroll down for video . Mr Tisdale, pictured right, heroically grabbed the bag - which contained £50,000 worth of jewellery - after hearing shop owner John Davis, pictured left, plead with the armed robbers . Mr Davis, who owns Selective Gold, said Mr Tisdale's quick thinking actions had saved his . business from going bust . 'There are always the ""what ifs?"" afterwards. You beat yourself up and ask, ""could I have done more?"".' Mr Tisdale, a service engineer for Toyota, was buying earrings with his wife, brother and sister-in-law when the incident unfolded. CCTV footage shows the robbers smashing . their way into the shop with sledgehammers and destroying display . cabinets in front of terrified staff and customers. The hooded gang then made off from the shop in Birmingham's jewellery quarter with a £30,000 haul. Today, Mr Tisdale told how he initially thought thebangs were a car back-firing, but then saw the robbers pour in. He said: 'It . seemed like an eternity, but it was very, very quick. They rely on . shock tactics, they shock you, they don’t give you time to gather your . thoughts. Mr Tisdale was captured on the shop's CCTV camera bravely . snatching back one of the bags the robbers had filled. It contained . £50,000 worth of jewellery . 'My wife was diligent and dialled 999 on her mobile, shielded by her sister. 'The bad part is John lost some of his business, but the bonus is saving the bag has helped him to continue with the business.' Mr Tisdale and his wife first met Mr Davis four years ago when they asked the craftsman to make their wedding rings. After the raid, the shop owner praised Mr Tisdale's actions saying he had 'effectively kept him in business'. CCTV from outside the shop shows one of the robbers approaching the reinforced security door with a sledgehammer before breaking in . The masked robber burst into the shop, threatening the store owners and customers with sledgehammers before using them to smash into the glass display cabinets . Customers and staff members look on terrified as the gang of robbers clambered over the glass display cabinets - their identities concealed by masks . The 57-year-old said: 'I have . worked hard building up the business and have not taken a holiday in . three years. 'You do all that and somebody comes in and snatches everything in just 48 seconds. 'The first we knew something was happening was when we heard two massive bangs at the door. 'It was mayhem in the minute that followed and I pleaded with them to not take the jewellery. 'I . said they may as well kill me because the last few years have been . really tough. I said: ""Please don’t do this, it will ruin me"" but they . didn’t care. Mr Davis, who has been in the jewellery trade for 40 years, said Ms Tisdale had 'effectively kept me in business' 'The customer who grabbed the bag from them effectively kept me in business. 'The police . took the bag to check for forensics and we only found out what was in . it when it was handed back. It turned out to be the most valuable bag . they had. 'Had they escaped with it, £30,000-worth of losses would have turned into £80,000. It was a very brave thing for him to do. 'Without the bag I would have had to shut the shop. I think he saw how stressed I was and he made an instinctive grab for it.' The robbers look at the jewellery in the cabinets before shattering the glass in one and packing the jewellery into two large bags . The gang ransacked the shop in less than a minute before making off with £30,000 worth of jewellery. Police were able to use the remaining bag to check for forensic evidence . Shop owner Mr Davis, a father-of-two, described how the robbers packed two large bags with jewellery in under 48 seconds. He said he has had to increase his security since the raid . Father-of-two Mr Davis, who has been in the trade for more than 40 years, said he was now terrified the raiders would return. He said: 'I wish there was more security in the area for traders. The police station has closed, but this is a high-risk area. 'I . have had to increase my own security measures. I assume a lot is going . on in the background with the police investigation, but I have heard . nothing from them. 'As . well as the financial loss the other big issue is the lasting impact. You are always on edge and worried it will happen again, but I just have . to plod on with what I have left.' Mr Tisdale, from Burton-on-Trent, said he sprung into action after hearing Mr Davis plead with the gang of masked robbers . Mr Davis said that it was the act of the customer that has . saved his shop, which he said had been facing financial trouble .

The band were famed for their hedonistic attitude to life and in 2006 Young took a 'sabbatical' from the band and did not return. Speaking at the time, lead singer Bobby Gillespie, said: 'Let's just say that he's got some problems that he's got to sort out for himself. 'It's a hard thing to talk about, because it's private and it's his life, and I don't think I have the right to judge him. 'I'd like Throbert to be alive. I'd like him to be well. I'd like him to be happy. Further than that I can't really say. I just hope he wants to get better.'

"Schools are to be barred from ordering pupils to run around a playing field as punishment. In her first significant break from her predecessor, Education Secretary Nicky Morgan is to scrap guidelines for headteachers set out by Michael Gove which suggest misbehaving children should be made to do laps of the school grounds. While the news has been welcomed by sports campaigners, one Tory MP described it as ‘a load of politically correct claptrap’. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan has said that making pupils run laps could put them off physical activity . Earlier this year, schools were told ‘tough but proportionate’ punishment could include writing lines, picking up litter in playgrounds, weeding, tidying classrooms and removing graffiti. Pupils could also be ordered to report to school early, clean dining halls or forfeit privileges such as joining in a non-uniform day. While Mrs Morgan is understood to support old-fashioned punishments, a private letter seen by the Daily Mail reveals she has agreed to a U-turn on using physical exercise to discipline children. Writing to campaigners who criticised using exercise as punishment, she said she agreed with figures such as marathon runner Paula Radcliffe, who argued that ‘physical activity is a joy, a pleasure’ rather than a means to improve bad behaviour. Mrs Morgan is herself a keen runner, and is due to take part in a half marathon in Leicester next month. In her first significant break from her predecessor, Education Secretary Nicky Morgan is to scrap guidelines for headteachers set out by Michael Gove which suggest naughty children should be made to do laps . In the letter to former long-distance runner David Moorcroft, who is chairman of the Run Group which promotes exercise, Mrs Morgan said: ‘I share your view that it [using exercise as a punishment] threatens to have a negative impact on the sport and on the view young people take of it. 'One of my priorities as Secretary of State is to encourage schools to do what they can to build the resilience and character of our young people, and I see sport as playing a crucial role in this.’ She added: ‘I have therefore asked officials to revise the guidance immediately and to remove any suggestion that running might be used as a form of punishment. A new version of the document – minus the offending clause – will be issued on the department’s website by the end of the week.’ Conservative MP for Shipley Philip Davies described the U-turn as a 'load of politically correct claptrap' Responding to the U-turn, Philip Davies, Conservative MP for Shipley, said: ‘What a load of politically correct claptrap. I remember having to run round the rugby pitch a few times when I misbehaved at school. It seemed to me like a perfectly reasonable punishment having done something wrong. ‘I’m sure it must be more constructive for children to run round a playing field than to stand outside a teacher’s room. I thought we were supposed to be concerned about rising obesity?’ But Mr Moorcroft said: ‘Nicky Morgan understood from the start why this mattered and has delivered a change on an issue that could have had a negative impact on running for future generations. ‘As a former PE teacher who remembers the bad old days, the inclusion of such a sanction had been particularly disappointing given the Olympic and Paralympic Legacy objective of encouraging participation in school sports and wider society.’ Before the guidance was issued, the Government argued many heads and teachers were unclear of what action they could take to discipline pupils, with almost one in three secondary teachers saying they did not feel confident using the powers they already had.

"Residents of Goulburn in country NSW got a surprise when they discovered their main tourist attraction had a serious case of 'blue balls'. The Big Merino has had a paint job as part of a campaign to raise awareness about prostate and testicular cancer and encourage men to get themselves checked regularly. The giant monument is located in the Southern Tablelands of NSW and has got the town talking about the slogan 'have you got the balls?'  painted on the rear of the ram. The Big Merino has had a paint job as part of a men's cancer 'blue balls' campaign to raise awareness about prostate and testicular cancer . Blue September is a nationwide awareness and fundraising initiative about all the cancers that affect men - not just prostate and testicular cancer, but also bowel, lung, liver, pancreatic and other cancers. Campaign director Mike Chapman told Daily Mail Australia that the biggest problem with men and cancer is 'late diagnosis'. 'Firstly, early diagnosis saves lives, it’s as simple as that. Men all too often present to the doctor too late with symptoms. Awareness through PR and media efforts helps change that,' Mr Chapman said. 'Secondly, cancer research is key. If you are diagnosed, funding ongoing research leads to better treatment options and outcomes. 'We are campaigning to encourage men to get themselves checked regularly because it's all about early detections.' It took six hours to paint the testicles and slogan on The Big Merino on Wednesday and will be removed at the end of the campaign. The giant monument is located in Goulburn in the Southern Tablelands of New South Wales .

Getting into the spirit: The men are getting involved to help raise awareness about prostate and testicular cancer and encourage men to get themselves checked . 'We thought the Big Merino was an obvious choice because it's located in the heart of Australia. It was just hanging there so we thought, 'why not?'. 'It's a great idea to get the word out and get people talking.' Mr Chapman said the campaign is also looking into different ways of spreading awareness. 'We moved to Melbourne on Thursday to paint the V8 Supercars grid blue ahead of the Wilson Security Sandown 500, which starts on Friday. V8 Supercar drivers David Reynolds and Garth Tandy getting blue ahead of the Wilson Security Sandown 500 .

The campaign plans to continue running the blue streak throughout Australia and the next stop is the Wrest Point Hotel Casino of Sandy Bay in Hobart, Tasmania on September 19. 'Why blue? Because it represents men. Women have always campaigned with the colour pink so we wanted to do something similar but a different approach to our fundraising. Mr Chapman is encouraging businesses and retailers, as well as individuals to support this worthy cause by purchasing Blue September wristbands (which allows you to write the name of a loved one past or present), paint their face blue, donate money or lend a hand as a volunteer. The fundraising campaign has raised nearly $3 million since inception 6 years ago. Funds go to the Australian Prostate Cancer Research and Australian Cancer Research Foundation to research for prevention and early diagnosis initiatives targeting men. Mr Chapman said the campaign has attracted a lot of high profile celebrities. 'We've had different characters involved from Mark Holden, Kyle and Jackie O, Marcia Hines, AFL Carlton's Chris Judd, singers Reece Mastin and Ronan Keating and many more.

"April Bailey, 34, of Woolwich, south east London, told police her former boyfriend had raped her and kept her lies going for five months before coming clean . A man spent 12 days locked up in a high security prison after his ex-girlfriend lied to police and falsely accused him of raping her. April Bailey, 34, of Woolwich, south east London, gave officers a detailed account of the fictional 'assault' by Andrew Frith, 36, and attended a rape suite where she agreed to DNA swabs being taken. Mr Frith spent 12 days in Belmarsh Prison, home to some of Britain's most dangerous criminals, before being allowed out on bail, and it was five months before Bailey eventually confessed to police that he hadn't raped her after all. Yesterday Bailey walked free from court, despite admitting perverting the course of justice by accusing an innocent man and despite the judge telling her: 'What you did was an appalling thing.' Prosecutor Ben Temple told Isleworth Crown Court that Bailey had had a 12-year 'on and off' relationship with Mr Frith before they broke up in January last year. He said that that same month, Bailey went to police and complained that she had been raped by him. 'She said he tried to kiss her and she declined and he later threw her to the floor and punched her in the back, likening herself to a punchbag,' added Mr Temple. 'They went to sleep, she alleged, but as she woke he forced himself on her and made her have sex with him.' Bailey claimed: 'I was crying and telling him: ""No, I don't want to have sex with you"".' The court heard she was taken to a specialist suite for victims of sex crime, where bruising was noted, intimate swabs taken, and she gave a video-taped interview. Mr Frith was arrested on January 27 and immediately told the officers: 'I think I know who this girl is. Was it April? That girl is crazy.' The next day he was remanded in custody,and remained locked up for 12 days until he was granted conditional bail. On February 6 Bailey again spoke to police and persisted with the fictitious rape-claim, despite details of her account proving false. 'She admitted to the officer that she lied about the manner in which she left the house and where she had gone,' explained the prosecutor. 'She apologised for that lie, but stressed the rest of her account was true and accurate. 'They built a case against Mr Frith, a prosecution case took shape, there were consultations with the Crown Prosecution Service, and a trial date set.' High security: Mr Frith spent 12 days in Belmarsh Prison, home to some of Britain's most dangerous criminals . However five months later, Bailey went to police saying Mr Frith had not in fact raped her and admitting she had lied. Mr Temple said: 'She said the bruising and injuries were nothing more than the result of heavy drinking and being restrained by Mr Frith.' Bailey's lawyer, Frances Ridout, told the court: 'Mr Frith ""tried it on"", to use her words, and she was resisting and after numerous attempts she gave in and that's when consensual sex happened. 'Her friend convinced her it was rape and was wrong. She's a vulnerable young woman and her friend saw her emotional, upset and with bruises.' She added: 'This was not a pre-planned or malicious allegation, but things getting out of control.' Judge Douglas Moore said: 'She had sufficient time to say: ""No, what I've done is wrong."" 'She has made an allegation against an innocent man, fine-tuned the case and he spent 12 days detained and five months charged.' 'This must have made this man's life absolute hell.  This is a bad offence and what must not be forgotten is the victim and his suffering.' He added: 'What you did was an appalling thing and someone suffered very badly.' Bailey was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment, suspended for two years, given an 18-month supervision order, given a six-month 8pm-8am curfew. The court heard that Mr Frith has since forgiven Bailey for what she did.","April Bailey, 34, had a long and stormy relationship with Andrew Frith, 36 .

"A pensioner drove for half a mile with a motorist clinging to his car bonnet before stopping the car, getting out and punching him in the face, a court heard. Anthony Lee, 74, was caught on CCTV driving off with Paul Malin, 26, hanging from his windscreen wipers after the two men had a disagreement about a minor collision. Footage played to the court showed Lee reversing into Mr Malin's parked purple Vauxhall Corsa as he tried to parallel park his green Subaru outside the Grove Tavern in Bournemouth. Scroll down for video . This CCTV still is said to show Paul Malin, 26, on the bonnet of a car driven by defendant Anthony Lee, 74 .

Getting closer: This still shows Lee's car braking as it edges closer to the parked Vauxhall Corsa . This image shows Mr Lee and pub regular Matt Fitzroy-Titley walking out to confront the elderly motorist . It sparked a row that ended with Lee driving off with Mr Malin on his bonnet and ended when he stopped the car half a mile away and punched Mr Malin in the face, Bournemouth Crown Court heard. Mr Malin told jurors he was working in the pub's cellar when a regular, Matt Fitzroy-Titley, told him someone had just reversed into his car, and they went outside to see what had happened. Barman Mr Malin came out of the pub and approached the driver only to be flung on the bonnet. Lee came to a halt half a mile away and then got out and twice punched Mr Malin in the face, jurors were told. The barman said: 'Matt approached the man and said to him ""You've just reversed into my mate's car"". The man was very dismissing. 'Matt said: ""If you don't get out of your car, I'm going to call the police"". 'The man became quite agitated. The next thing I knew I was on the bonnet of the car. 'It happened so fast I didn't have a chance to react. It was a case of on the car or under the car. I held on for dear life. The man then drove off down the high street with me on the bonnet. A row between the men ensued - this CCTV still is thought to show Mr Malin standing in front of Lee's car . Mr Malin said: 'It happened so fast I didn't have a chance to react.  It was a case of on the car or under the car' Lee, of Bournemouth, told police he had felt threatened by the pair and thought the best thing to do was drive off . 'I was screaming all sorts of profanities at him, but he wasn't looking at me. 'The car paused briefly at traffic lights. That moment felt like a lifetime. I was not sure whether to stay on the car or try to get off. Before I could make a decision I was off down the high street again.' Mr Malin, who said he had suffered from back pain since the incident, said when the car finally stopped, the elderly motorist got out and hit him in the face. He added: 'The man jumped out and shouted at me. I was still in shock. He grabbed my shirt and pulled me towards him. 'The next thing I knew I had a right hook to the face.' Scene of the incident: Mr Malin was working at the Grove Tavern in the Southbourne area of Bournemouth . Mr Malin, a photographer and graphic designer, said he grabbed the keys to Lee's car through an open window then ran off down the street to get help. A concerned passerby took Mr Malin to her home then dialled 999. The court heard that in a police interview Lee said that he had felt threatened by the pair and thought the best thing to do was drive off.

"A audio recording recounting an alleged massacre of German prisoners and Papua New Guinea villagers during the First World War by Australian troops has been uncovered. The recording, of a village elder in the 1960s, may confirm long-standing rumours of a mass execution of German and Papua New Guinea prisoners during the Battle of Bitapaka on September 11, 1914. The Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force were sent to what was then German New Guinea - now part of PNG - to destroy a German telegraph station exactly 100 years today.

Members of the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force surveys the scene during the occupation of German territory by Australian forces . The rumours of Australia's war crimes have been circulating for years but has only now been seemingly confirmed through a newly emerged tape recording of an alleged witness, the ABC reports. The elder claims he saw Australian troops land near his village of Kabakaul - southeast of Rabaul in East New Britain province of PNG - further witnessed the execution of two white men and a number of native police. The man on the tape is identified as 'Old Bob' and speaks in the Tok Pisin language. 'A big man of war said ""fire"" and they all died,' Bob said. 'They shot all the men who were lined up on one side. Only one boy was alright, a young boy such as this, he ran away. So they all died and the trench they dug was full with dead bodies.' It is believed the audio was recorded in the 1960s by plantation owner  Ian Purvis, who was living near Rabaul. His wife Irene found the tapes when she went through her husband's belongings after he died. Old Bob told Purvis in the interview that he saw the Diggers trick the Germans by telling them the war had ended.

"A faulty phone charger is believed to be the cause of a massive blaze which ripped through a house in Sydney on Thursday morning. A family of five were preparing to depart for the day when they noticed smoke billowing from the hall of their Malcolm Avenue home at Mt Pritchard, in Sydney's west, about 7.45am. A man, a woman and their three children - two aged in their 20s and a girl, 13 - were lucky to escape the  inferno which a NSW Fire and Rescue spokesman believed was sparked by a 'cheap, after-market' phone charger. Scroll down for video . The fire aftermath of the Mt Pritchard blaze which fire investigators believed started by a faulty charger .

The family of five managed to flee when they noticed smoke billowing in the hallway . Fire investigators combing through the aftermath of the blaze are still yet to confirm the type of charger, but strongly suspect that it is what sparked the electrical blaze at the front of the home. 'It will take probably take until this time tomorrow to come up with a determination, but at this point the indicators are pointing in that direction (faulty phone charger),' the spokesman told Daily Mail Australia. He said given the ferocity of the fire, which left the home with 80 per cent structural damage, it would be hard to determine what type of charger it was. 'It is well known that those particular types of after market chargers are dangerous,' he said. He called for a ban on the sale of generic charges which are not manufactured by the companies who sell the phones they are designed to charge. 'That's why iPhone chargers are not cheap - they are specific chargers built for those phones.' The family were preparing to head to work and school when the suspected electrical blaze started .

Meanwhile paramedics at the scene said the family, who had been preparing to leave to go to school and work, was lucky to scramble to safety prior to the roof collapsing.

"Labour MP Jim Dobbin died suddenly on a Parliamentary visit to Poland . The by-election sparked by the death of Labour MP Jim Dobbin is likely to be held on October 9. A writ setting the date for the contest in the Heywood and Middleton constituency in Greater Manchester is to be moved by the party in the Commons today, a source said yesterday. It is the same day as voters go to the polls in Clacton, Essex, following Douglas Carswell’s defection to Ukip from the Conservatives. Mr Dobbin, who had represented the seat since 1997, died at the weekend at the age of 73 while on a Parliamentary trip to Poland. At the 2010 general election, he won the seat with a majority of 5,971 over the Tory candidate. Mr Dobbin was in the country with other MPs as part of a Council of Europe human rights trip when he died suddenly. His wife Pat, who he married fifty years ago this year, is believed to have been with him at the time. Labour leader Ed Miliband said at the time it was a ‘sad day for Parliament,’ adding that Mr Dobbin was a ‘dedicated public servant’. Mr Miliband said: 'Jim's death is a sad day for parliament. He was a dedicated public servant, representing the people of Rochdale on the council and at Westminster for three decades. 'Working in the NHS for more than 30 years, Jim had a deep passion for helping others. 'A lifelong committed Catholic, Jim always took a lead in fostering links between the Church and the Labour Party, and his strong faith informed every aspect of his political and public life. This was recognised by Pope Benedict XVI when he made Jim a Papal knight. 'I will miss Jim’s good friendship and decency. On behalf of the Labour Party, I offer our sincere condolences to his wife, Pat and, their children. We will all miss him.' The MP was made a papal knight by Pope Benedict in 2008. In parliament, he co-chaired a group pushing for more vaccines children in the developing world. He voted against the same-sex marriage bill last year and spoke out against the plans in Parliament, saying: ‘I think MPs who voted for this change will rue the day they did so.’ Mr Dobbin was the local MP for Fusilier Lee Rigby, the soldier who was murdered in Woolwich, south-east London, last year. He said at the time that the death had ‘absolutely traumatised’ people in Fusilier Rigby's home town of Middleton, Greater Manchester. Mr Dobbin, the son of a coal miner, was born in Kincardine, in Fife. He went to Napier College, Edinburgh, where he studied bacteriology and virology, before working as a microbiologist for 33 years, 22 of which were for the Royal Oldham Hospital. Former Labour deputy prime minister John Prescott and the party's leader Ed Miliband today paid tribute to Mr Dobbin . Lord Prescott said: ‘Jim was an excellent local MP, a strong believer in Europe, a proud Scot and a passionate defender of the NHS. ‘His passing is such a tragic loss and he will be sadly missed by the Labour movement. Jim was a great comrade.’ Commons Speaker John Bercow said: ‘He was a deeply principled and independent-minded parliamentarian; respected and well-liked by his colleagues, he will be greatly missed.’ Ivan Lewis, Labour MP for Bury South, tweeted: ‘Jim Dobbin was a man of great integrity and decency. Sometimes didn't agree but always respected his sincerity.’ Manchester Central MP Lucy Powell tweeted: ‘Really sorry to hear of the sudden death of Jim Dobbin MP. I only saw him on Friday voting against bedroom tax. He was a great MP.’ Simon Danczuk wrote: ‘Shockled and Saddened to hear Jim Dobbin MP has died. My condolences go out to his wife Pat & their children. He will be sorely missed.’ Fellow Labour MP Jonathan Reynolds wrote: ‘Absolutely stunned by the news about Jim. I spoke to him just before he left for Poland. An incredibly committed MP and a good man.’ Philip Davies added: ‘So so sorry to learn of the death of Labour MP Jim Dobbin. One of the nicest, most honourable and decent MPs - he will be greatly missed.’ Former Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy said: ‘Very sad to hear of my friend and Council of Europe colleague Jim Dobbins sudden death.

"Affluent and attractive, Dorset has been ranked the best place for a golden retirement. In fact, it is one of a string of areas in the west of Britain that top a league table of ‘grey hotspots’. But there is one notable exception to the catalogue of picturesque or coastal destinations. Second place in the list was the comfortable if unglamorous Midlands’ town of Solihull. Dorset has long scored strongly in official records for its high life expectancy, good health, and general affluence. Scroll down for video . Affluent and attractive, Dorset has been ranked the best place for a golden retirement. Above, the county's fabulously expensive seaside mansion suburb of Sandbanks, in Poole . Second place in the list was the comfortable but rather unglamorous Birmingham suburb of Solihull . The table, compiled by analysts at the Prudential, reflects levels of home ownership, health, the number of unpaid carers who help relatives, the numbers of pension-age people who are married, and, as a measure of the ability of local retired people to enjoy travel, the number of pensioners who hold passports. Many of the top 10 destinations are coastal or highly picturesque areas which have long attracted those able to afford to move after retirement to the most attractive parts of the country. They include the coastal districts of the Vale of Glamorgan, North Somerset; the county of Hampshire and the Dorset town of Poole; Monmouthshire, which includes the Wye Valley and the Brecon Beacons; and South Gloucestershire, which lies between the Cotswolds and the Severn Estuary. The Glamorgan district includes Barry and a coastline comparable to North Cornwall; North Somerset includes the resort of Weston-super-Mare; and Hampshire has both popular coastal resorts and attractive country towns. Poole includes the fabulously expensive seaside mansion suburb of Sandbanks. Solihull, on the other hand, offers a Land Rover factory, most of Birmingham airport, and easy access to the M42. The area is, however, long established as a well-off suburb with good schools and high house prices, and its strength as a retirement zone may have come about because its residents are reluctant to move out when they leave their jobs. Vince Smith-Hughes of Prudential said: ‘Our analysis clearly shows that the quality of life experienced by retirees varies significantly across the country. ‘However, it is not always possible for people to up sticks and move to a location they consider to be more desirable, when the time comes to give up work. 'Family ties and the cost of moving home often dictate where people find themselves living as pensioners.’ The Quality of Retirement Index was produced by examining statistics on 170 local authority areas with the largest numbers of retirees. Quality of retirement score out of 50. Dorset: 46 . Solihull: 44 . Vale of Glamorgan: 42 . North Somerset: 42 . Buckinghamshire: 42 . Monmouthshire: 41 . Poole: 41 . South Gloucstershire: 41 . Hampshire: 41 . Wokingham: 41 . Source: Prudential Quality of Retirement Index . Each was given a percentage score on the five retirement factors taken into account, and the results were put together to give a final tally out of 50. Solihull scored 44 points, with more than eight out of 10 pensioners owning their homes and nearly as many holding passports, while more than half are in good health and nearly half are married rather than single, divorced or widowed. More than one in eight of its population provide unpaid care to children, a spouse, a partner or to a relative or a friend. Dorset towns and villages are a favoured destination for people retiring from jobs in major cities. The town of Wimborne has the highest number of married people in the country; the Prudential last year named Christchurch as the town with the highest concentration of pensioners in its population; and in West Dorset one in 10 of the population are likely to be aged over 85 in less than 20 years’ time. The report said: ‘Dorset was found to provide retirees with the best quality of life. Dorset has one of the highest retirement populations in the country.’ Mr Smith-Hughes said: ‘People looking to secure a retirement in an area where the quality of life is already high, or those simply looking to be as financially comfortable as possible when they give up work, are well advised to follow the simple rule of saving as much as possible as early as possible in their working lives.'","Second place on list is unglamorous Birmingham suburb of Solihull .

"Neil Robert Edwards, 24, has been banned from driving for 12 weeks and fined £300 after he was caught doing 131.5mph in a Corsa . An electrician caught doing 131mph in a Vauxhall Corsa while on his way to a garage specialising in engine modifications has been banned from driving for 12 weeks. Neil Robert Edwards, 24, from Mynydd Isa near Mold, in Wales, was spotted by police hurtling along the A55  at nearly twice the 70mph speed limit despite the wet conditions. When officers stopped Edwards to ask him where he was going, he told them he was rushing to 'Demon Tweeks', a garage which sells parts to tune up car engines. Realising what he had done, Edwards then asked officers: 'Is there nothing we can do about this?' He was today banned from driving for 12 weeks at Flintshire Magistrates’ Court as well as being fined £300 plus £115 in costs. A standard model Vauxhall Corsa comes with a 1.2 litre engine and is capable of a top speed of 107mph. Prosecutor Gareth Jones told the court that when Edwards was caught on February 15 the road was wet but it had stopped raining. He said that such cases were sometimes charged as dangerous driving because of the excessive speed but the defendant had been charged simply with speeding as the roads had been so empty at the time. Phillip Lloyd Jones, defending, said that there was no excuse for driving at such a speed, adding that his client understood that the 70mph speed limit should be adhered to. The defendant was going to a shop and was late, he bitterly regretted his actions and fully co-operated when stopped, Mr Jones added. Mr Jones said that the consequences could be very serious for his client as he travels the country as an electrician doing maintenance work. He said that the company had already placed a black mark against Edwards' name, adding that he could be fired depending on the length of the ban.

"A cyclist has launched a one-man campaign to shame dangerous drivers – and fellow riders - by posting video footage of reckless manoeuvres. The 24-year-old - who wishes to remain anonymous  - uses a GoPro headcam to film drivers in Manchester stopping in cycle lanes, making risky U-turns and  turning without checking mirrors. A careless cyclist is also shown trying to squeeze past a bus in one video. Scroll down for video . A car parked in the middle of a cycle lane in Manchester receives a ticket from a parking attendant . The researcher, who lives in Rusholme, then posts the videos  on Youtube under the name MCR Cyclist. He has vowed to continue his crusade until the behaviour of motorists improves towards cyclists. 'It was a case of recording for my own safety and protection. But I starting putting them online as an educational tool,' said the anonymous cyclist. 'I get a lot of drivers on mobile phones but police struggle to take action if it isn't their footage - they usually just talk to drivers to warn them.' A bus pulling in to a bus stop narrowly avoids hitting the cyclist, who posts videos of dangerous driving . A driver takes a rest at the wheel while his car is parked in a cycle lane on the edge of a junction . A car suddenly turns left without indicating and narrowly avoids hitting the cyclist who is close behind . 'The police have seen my videos and they have spoken to some drivers and considered taking action so I get quite a lot of abuse. 'I don't want to be vulnerable if people recognise me on my way to work for my own safety.' But he also gets positive feedback. 'Drivers who were abusive on the roadside when incidents have happened then view the footage and get in touch to say they are now seeing it from a whole new perspective and are genuinely apologetic. 'On those occasions, I take down the video because it's done its job and the drivers seem genuinely aware that what they did was wrong. 'If I get just one driver to change their ways - and potentially save a cyclist or pedestrian from harm - then what I'm doing is worth it.' A silver car appears to be turning right at a busy junction in Manchester city centre . But the driver does not seem to see the cyclist and makes a dangerous U-turn in the middle of the street . The cyclist stops behind the silver car to watch the driver head off in the direction it had just come from . He began filming around five years ago after being hit by a driver. As there were no independent witnesses, no action could be taken. 'If I'm in danger or if I had to take some form of action to prevent myself or others being harmed I upload it,' he said. He thinks Manchester's main challenges are driver awareness - and infrastructure maintenance. He added: 'I think the main thing is cycle infrastructure being maintained. Quite often cycle pathways are installed but not maintained, they aren't cleaned well enough - there is glass and obstacles which makes it unsafe. 'Copenhagen has segregated cycle lanes and that's definitely the way forward to encourage more people to cycle.'

The video shows Martin hurling racial slurs at the man recording the incident, 46-year-old Lindsey Cooks. It was turned over to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, which led to Martin's arrest. At a preliminary court hearing last month, Cooks testified that he began recording Martin after he witnessed him cursing at the puppy while punching and kicking the puppy in the head, the Antelope Valley Times reported. Daisy was taken to the Los Angeles County Department of Animal Care and Control. The puppy was dragging one of its legs and walking with a limp, according to testimony at the hearing.  and appeared to have no injuries.

"These dramatic photos capture a herd of elephants as they charge towards the Tarangire River in Tanzania during their seasonal migration - chasing away hundreds of buffalo cooling off in the shallow water. Israeli zoologist Michal Samuni-Blank photographed the majestic elephants as they approached the river, where roughly 500 buffalo were escaping from the parched African heat. The herd of roughly 25 elephants - both adults and calves - can be seen sloping down a grassy hill before breaking into a run as they get closer to the water - a scarce resource during the dry season. Watering hole: Israeli zoologist Michal Samuni-Blank first captured roughly 500 buffaloes as they cooled off in the shallow water of the Tarangire River in Tanzania . Migration: The zoologist photographs the herd of thirsty elephants - roughly 25 adults and calves - as they make their way towards the water . Charge: The elephants, pictured in the foreground of the image, picked up speed as they approached the water, ready to chase away the lingering buffaloes . Startled: At the sight of the elephants, some of the buffaloes start to leave the shallow water and climb up the grassy hill on the other side of the river, pictured right . The elephants are then captured driving away the buffalo - who flee the watering hole at the sight of the stampeding herd. The chase is made more dramatic by the cloud of dust that is kicked up by the animals as they charge over the parched African ground. After chasing away lingering buffalo from the river bank in a dramatic pursuit, the elephants are left to relax in the water - where they are photographed frolicking and playing happily. But Dr Samuni-Blank, who watched the scene from 500 metres away at the Tarangire Safari Lodge, said that there was no physical contact between the two species. The zoologist, who is now based in New York, said: 'An elephant family - both adults and calves - approached the Tarangire river after a long journey. They started running towards the water when it came into sight. 'Elephants are herbivores, but they are very protective of their young calves, so they started chasing away a huge herd of buffaloes. Round up: The elephants break through the herd of buffalo standing in the river, before continuing up the grassy bank on the other side . Protective: More elephants from the herd join in chasing the buffaloes. Dr Samuni-Bank explained that the usually docile animals would have been protecting their calves . Force: Ears flapping in the wind, the elephants can be seen running faster as they drive the lingering buffalo from the water- a scare resource during the dry season . Drama: Dust is kicked up by the animals as the chase intensifies. Dr Samuni-Bank described the experience as 'watching the National Geographic Channel in real life' 'The buffaloes fled the scene, running up the hill, away from the river. When all the buffaloes have left the river, the elephants started drinking and playing in the water. 'The dust that the animals kicked up added mystery and excitement to the scene.' During the dry season in September, water resources for animals, like elephants, are very limited. It forces the animals to go on long journeys through the scrub in search of something to drink. Dr Samuni-Bank continued: 'The reaction I get is unbelievable and generally people can't believe I saw this. 'They say it is like watching the National Geographic Channel in real life. 'I was thrilled to witness this, it was a very powerful moment and I appreciated every second of it. 'Elephants are highly intelligent animals and are usually very gentle with other creatures. 'Even though the elephants chased away the buffaloes they didn't physically attack any of them - throughout the chase there was no physical contact between the two species.' Elephants go on seasonal migrations in search of food, water and mates, and typically coexist peacefully with other herbivores, which will usually stay out their way.","Herd of roughly elephants captured charging towards the Tarangire River in Tanzania during seasonal migration .

"A North Carolina man is accused of selling a crushed up Pop-Tart to an undercover police officer while trying to pass it off as cocaine. Cameron Mitchell was making a delivery on June 19 to a convenience store in Halifax, North Carolina, where the 30-year-old allegedly agreed to sell his special blend of 'crack cocaine' to the man for $20. Authorities tested the substance he handed over, and it came up negative for cocaine but apparently positive for the popular frosted breakfast pastry. Cameron Mitchell tried to convince an undercover cop that crushed Pop-Tarts bits were in fact crack cocaine . Mitchell says committed the use because he needed the cash . There was no word on which flavor he pretended was cocaine. Agents later found Mitchell's delivery truck at another convenience store, and they say he admitted to the ruse, WCTI12 reported. He was arrested on September 4 and faces charges of selling or delivering a counterfeit controlled substance and creating a counterfeit controlled substance. Mitchell, of Rocky Mount, North Carolina, allegedly told the agents he did it because he was desperate for cash.

"This is the moment a rescue operation was launched after a swimmer narrowly missed being hit by a 4,000 tonne cargo ship in the River Blyth because he said it  was a 'cheaper' swim than the local pool. Volunteers from Blyth RNLI, police and the local coastguard team all attended the scene. It is believed the man was drunk when he risked his life and entered the water. The incident occurred on Sunday afternoon and it prompted a safety warning from the RNLI’s volunteer crew at Blyth who urged people not to risk their lives. The swimmer was observed by a port employee and a person on the shore as well as a port employee who was involved in the berthing of the Karla C. The two observers said they had seen a person swimming in the river near the cargo ship just after 3pm as it was being ferried by a local pilot vessel to Battleship Wharf in the Port of Blyth. The video and pictures of the rescue operation were taken by on-board cameras moments after the near fatal collision with large cargo vessel Karla C. Rescue operation: An RNLI volunteer gets into the lifeboat as they launch their rescue operation . View from lifeboat: A picture of the inside of the RNLI lifeboat as they depart in search of the swimmer . The cargo ship had just travelled from the port of Vilanova in Spain and it was nearing the end of its voyage and travelling at a relatively slow speed when the swimmer was first spotted near the ship. A lifeboat was subsequently launched from Blyth and three volunteers were sent to attend the scene. Despite their presence and their warnings about the dangers involved the man refused to get into the lifeboat and rejected their assistance. The swimmer, who appeared to be drunk, then told the volunteers, 'I'm coming for a swim in here because its cheaper than the local pool.' Rescue: The RNLI lifeboat speeds along as it makes its journey towards the swimmer in the River Blyth . The man was informed of the presence of a plethora  of smaller boats which were working on the river and he was warned that they could pose a threat to his safety. After some discussion between the volunteers and the swimmer the man eventually took their advice and he swam towards a ladder and made his way to safety. Immediately after the incident the police and the local coastguard team spoke to the swimmer. Blyth RNLI Deputy Launching Authority (DLA) Paul Raine told ChronicleLive: 'Is it really worth risking your life going swimming in the cold water of a working harbour to save paying a few pounds to visit the local heated swimming pool?'

"These breathtaking photos were captured by adventurer Daniel Fox - who spent three months circling the remote and unspoiled islands of Alaska in just a kayak. The explorer, 40, from San Francisco, took on the challenge to offer people a tantalising glimpse into the region's spectacular scenery and animals. Mr Fox, also a wildlife photographer, first visited the north-western state in 2013 and fell in love with the abundance of sea otters, deer and eagles. This mesmerising picture shows explorer Mr Fox inside strolling through the famous Mendenhall Glacier in Juneau Alaska . He decided to return this summer and spent three months travelling around the islands by kayak, meeting humpback whales and brown bears along the way. Armed with just a few supplies he camped on the site where Russians established one of their first settlements in Alaska in the late 1700s. He regularly awoke to bears and deer inspecting his tent - but the animals were merely curious about the lone human camping in the open air. He said: 'I camped where the Russians established the location of their first Alaska settlement and first substantial European settlement on the Pacific Coast of North America, north of California. 'I dined watching humpbacks breaching and feeding, listening to their roaring splash echoing around, bouncing off the steep mountains. Mr Fox claims claims that it's his mission to bridge the gap that has developed between nature and people(above he kayaks in the Mendenhall Glacier) This beautiful photo was taken at the outset of the trip - he is pictured at Bear Glacier next to his kayak in April 2014 in British Columbia, Canada . A sea lion yawns at Daniel Fox as it sits on rocks in Kodiak Island, Alaska - the explorer describes himself as an artist and a storyteller . 'I went back to Mendenhall Glacier but this time paddling the lake and exploring the icebergs. It was during that outing that I found this amazing iceberg cave. 'Kayaking is a really intimate relationship with the water and the places you visit. You are sitting in this small cockpit, feeling every little ripple, wave, breeze, or current.' Mr Fox, who counts Sir David Attenborough as one of his heroes, describes himself as a photographer, storyteller and artist and says his mission is to bridge the gap between nature and the public. Daniel Fox splashes water into the camera as he kayaks around the stunning scenery in June this year in Afognak Island, Alaska . An otter emerges from the water and appears to wave at the camera while a soaking wet fox walks on the beach staring menacingly in Mr Fox's direction . Not one to shy away from adventure, he is currently kayaking down the Pacific coast from Victoria, Canada, to San Francisco, California. The astonishing 1,000 mile journey is in aid of Wilderness Immersion for Leadership and Discovery (W.I.L.D.), a foundation Mr Fox started to connect young people with wildlife. The goal is to raise $14,500 in sponsorship so that two underprivileged teenagers can attend a 30-day sea kayaking camp in Alaska in 2015. He is now three weeks into the journey, has kayaked more than 300 miles, bringing him to waters off the coast of north Oregon, and has raised just under $5,000. The intrepid explorer is currently three weeks into a monstrous 1,000 mile Pacific kayak expedition from Victoria, Canada, to San Francisco, California . The explorer says 'nature is raw, rough, cruel, pretty, beautiful, inspiring, but above all, a humble experience' (pictured above is a red fox) The adventurer said he would regularly wake to find deer sniffing through his belongings (above a black sitka deer inspects his camp on Kodiak island) A lone brown bear looks straight into the camera as it  walks along the beach in this image taken in May 2014 on Admiralty Island, Alaska . On his foundation's website, Mr Fox says: 'Ever since I was a young boy, I found my inspiration and comfort in nature. It taught me about life, and death. 'Nature is raw, rough, cruel, pretty, beautiful, inspiring, but above all, a humble experience.' Explaining his inspiration for starting the foundation he says: 'Unfortunately many of today's youth are immersed in a totally different reality. 'Living in front of the computer, the television omnipresent and socially connected via smartphones, they spend little time in nature and rarely disconnect from technology.

"U.S. officials told the Associated Press on Thursday that retired Marine Lieutenant General John Allen will coordinate the broad international effort to battle the self-declared Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS), as nations begin to determine what part they will play. Several U.S. officials said Allen will coordinate the contributions of various nations. Nearly 40 countries around the world have agreed to join the fight, although few have said they will put soldiers in harm's way. In a post-retirement television interview, Allen said he was concerned that Iraq was descending into chaos following the U.S. troop pullout at the end of 2011. Asked if the Middle Eastern country would be more stable if the Obama administration had left a residual force behind,he responded, 'I don’t think there’s any question.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Retired Marine Lt. Gen. John Allen said after his retirement that 'I don't think there's any question' Iraq would have been safer if the US hadn't withdrawn all its forces, but now he's on mop-up duty as ISIS grows . President Barack Obama said Wednesday night that he would rely on an international coalition to help 'degrade and destroy' ISIS -- a coalition that Gen. Allen will lead . 'My fear is that we could see a polarization of the principle elements in Iraq,' he told ABC News. Allen cited 'the increase in violence for all of us that served there, in particular those of us who served in the Anbar Province, which was a really violent area ... We don’t want to see it return to that.' Anbar hasn't been the focus of ISIS's reign of terror – those operations have mostly been focused to the north – but that region, which abuts Syria to the west, is a reliable transit point for jihadis who travel between the two countries across a largely invisible border. Allen will come to the job with vast experience coordinating international allies on the warfront. He served as deputy commander in Iraq's Anbar province from 2006 to 2008, working with Arab partners to organize the Sunni uprising against al-Qaeda. Allen was also the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan from 2011 to 2013, another position that put him in close contact with America's international allies. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the appointment ahead of an announcement. Allen (right) was ensnared in a sex scandal -- many say unfairly -- in 2013 linked to disgraced Gen. David Petraeus . Petraeus slept with his biographer, Paula Broadwell (right), and both generals carried on allegedly flirtatious email relationships with Tampa socialite Jill Kelley (left) Allen became tabloid fodder in 2013 when his retirement was preceded by a sex scandal involving Gen. David Petraeus, then the director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Petraeus was caught having an extramarital affair with Paula Broadwell, his biographer. An investigation found that Allen and Petraeus had both become uncomfortably friendly with socialite Jill Kelley, who lived in Tampa where U.S. Central Command is located. Allen was accused of flirting with Kelley in a series of conversations that spanned more than 1,200 emails, and ultimately left military service to help his wife recover from a severe autoimmune disease.","Top Marine said after his retirement that 'I don't think there's any question' Iraq would have been safer if the US hadn't withdrawn all its forces .

"Passengers travelling Tigerair Australia and Jetstar should be prepared to pay a fee of up to $85 if carry-on exceeds 10 kilograms, following recent crack-down warnings from the two arch-rival airlines . Passengers travelling Tigerair Australia and Jetstar should be prepared to pay a fee of up to $85 if carry-on exceeds 10 kilograms, following recent crack-down warnings from the two arch-rival airlines. Tigerair Australia will begin tighter measures for carry-on bags from September 18, after eight months of warning passengers not to exceed its baggage limits. Now anyone who does not abide by Tiger's free of charge carry-on baggage limit of 10 kilograms, will incur a $70 fee for a flight less than 1 hour and 45 minutes, or $85 for a longer flight, and if your baggage exceeds 15 kilograms, expect to pay even more. Passengers have the first three months of the crackdown, to get used to the strict fees, with the airline allowing a 40 per cent discount of the penalty, before full fees kick in. Since the start of the year, Tiger has began positioning extra staff at departure gates, policing carry-on limits and issuing warnings to anyone that did not adhere, Sydney Morning Herald reported. 'From now on we are simply asking all passengers to play by the rules as there will be increased monitoring and the risk of a penalty charge for those that ignore them,'  said Tiger commercial director Adam Rowe. A customer service officer from Jetstar told Daily Mail Australia that staff at Jetstar has been told to look out for people who try to avoid oversized baggage penalties.

"Jailed: Susan Warren stole £340,000 from the farm supply firm where she worked over seven years . A crooked mother-of-two stole more than £340,000 from the farming supply firm where she worked - and spent most of it on ordinary everyday items like food. Susan Warren, 57, has been jailed  after bosses discovered her seven-year ruse at Fearing International, which sells livestock-rearing equipment  in Brixworth, Northamptonshire. Northampton Crown Court heard she wrote false invoices for stock which had never been bought and siphoned the funds into her own account. Her scam began in 2004 and went unnoticed until 2011 at the firm, which sells equipment including sheep shampoo, ear tags, castration pliers and stress balls for pigs. The court heard the Warren, of Daventry, Northamptonshire,  used the names of real suppliers on her invoices including Provini Ltd, based in Lichfield, Staffordshire. Her crimes were discovered when her firm’s parent company Ritchey Limited discovered a ‘spike’ in the purchase ledger account and launched a disciplinary hearing. Further investigations showed Warren had been making substantial payments into her own bank and credit card accounts for seven years. Yet despite being more than £35,000 in debt, Warren was using the money to buy everyday items such as supermarket shopping in a bid to 'maintain family relations', the court heard. Steven Evans, defending, said: 'Here was a woman with low self-esteem. She had a desperate desire to gain credibility in a bid to maintain family relations. 'While this money was being taken she was already in debt. She continued to take loans from banks and other lenders. The funds vanished from Fearing International, whose headquarters (pictured) are in rural Northamptonshire . 'This is not spending vast amounts of money on fast cars or exotic locations - this is just spending, spending, spending on everyday matters at a significant level.' Warren admitted theft and was jailed today for two-and-a-half years at Northampton Crown Court. Recorder Ian Dove said: 'I understand the reason you did this was to seek the approval and endorsement of your family. 'The truth of the matter is that you have let them down very badly indeed.'","Susan Warren, 57, took cash over seven years while working as  manager .

After at least one parent complained to the McKinley Middle School administrators, and now the unnamed teacher will be forced to apologize to the sixth-graders for the controversial piece of homework. According to a copy of the assignment released to the media, the teacher asked the students to write the similarities and differences between the two leaders in a Venn diagram, based on what they had read in two different texts.

"Glamorous in sequins and hats embellished with sprays of peacock feathers and lashings of lace, the stylish women of Doncaster were out in force as Ladies Day at the St Leger Festival got underway. One of the oldest British race meetings, the St Leger festival started life in 1776 and has since become a Yorkshire institution - and a magnet for racing fans from all over the county. But although the going was good and the bookies busy, all eyes were instead on the colourfully dressed ladies as they descended on the racecourse dressed to impress in bold brights and chic monochrome ensembles. Scroll down for video . Colourful: A trio of glamorously dressed local ladies arrive sporting an array of bright hues, including imperial purple, crimson and royal blue, ahead of the opening race . Stylish: A lady opts for an unusual 1950s-style fruit print dress and matching hat, while another opted for a classic scarlet and black ensemble . Glamorous: Ladies sporting vast purple and bright blue hats enjoy a sunny glass of champagne as they wait for the action to get underway at Doncaster . Stylish: A lady in a demure straw hat and navy blue bandage dress watches the races with her friend in a sheer cream frock and gorgeous black and white hat . Colourful: A patriotic chap in a bright red, blue and white Union Jack print suit and a lady looking very smart in a black and grey printed ensemble . Elegant though the many ladies in black and white were, the big winners in the style stakes wore cheerful brights, with one lady opting for a pretty coral frock accessorised with nude peep toe heels and a demure neutral straw fascinator. Another looked wonderful in an all-lemon ensemble, while bright shades of crimson, royal blue and emerald green also looked super and certainly stood out from the rest. Unfortunately not everyone displayed the same good taste, with one or two opting for ensembles better suited to clubbing with the heels to match, while some also sported enormous tattoos. Nevertheless, with fashion scouts scouring the racecourse for the best dressed lady, the vast majority had clearly made a real effort to wow the judges and win the top prize of a holiday to New York. Patriotic: A group of ladies do their bit for the Union in fabulous blue, crimson and white ensembles on their day out on Ladies Day at Doncaster's St. Leger Festival . Going for gold: A lady looks lovely in an extravagant gold hat and navy blue lace dress while another was pretty in an all-lemon ensemble . Making an entrance: A lady is chic in a pretty coral dress, neat nude shoes and a matching hat, while her friend opted for a glamorous gold gown, black hat and shoes . Pulling out all the stops: With a trip to New York the prize for the best-dressed racegoer, ladies arriving at the St. Leger Festival had pulled out all the stops . Aintree might have the world's biggest race in the shape of the Grand National but Doncaster is just as prestigious and like its Liverpudlian competitor, has plenty to offer in the style stakes. Both Aintree, Doncaster and neighbouring York have relatively relaxed dress codes compared to Ascot, although all three insist on guests making do without jeans and sportswear. As at Aintree, Doncaster is a hotbed of northern glamour with short skirts and sky high heels regularly spotted in and around the paddock. Colourful hats are a more recent innovation, although as today's event demonstrates, the ladies of Doncaster know a thing or two when it comes to buying hats. Indeed, with the majority of ladies arriving dressed to kill, organisers have decided it is male racegoers who require a bigger nudge, with the more specific rules laid out for men. For instance, while ladies must be 'smartly dressed', men are told to wear a jacket and tie in the Premier Enclosure and a collared shirt in the County Enclosure and in private boxes. In the Grandstand, however, no real dress code applies with even fancy dress allowed, provided you call the racecourse first and let them know what to expect. What's tat? A lady shows off her chic pheasant feather hat and floral tattoo, while another demonstrates how to do bold brights with aplomb . Looking lovely: A racegoer looks wonderful in monochrome dress and matching hat, a race day staple beloved of the Queen and Zara Phillips among others . Peacock: As at York, Aintree and Ascot, peacock feather plumes proved popular among stylish racegoers, as did bold brights and even a dash or two of print . Lady in red: A glamorous racegoer shows off her classic red and black ensemble, complete with a crimson lace dress, an elegant pendant and a vast titfer . Going for bold: A lady opts for a large hat decorated with plumes of peacock feathers, while another chooses a revealing dress in a flattering shade of green . The winner's haul also includes a trip to London Fashion Week, while runners-up also get prizes and a place in Doncaster Racecourse's #bestdressedselfie social media campaign. 'DFS Ladies Day is the social highlight of the four day St Leger Festival with ladies from across South Yorkshire donning their most stylish outfits and hats and going all out to look their very best,' explains Doncaster Racecourse managing director, Mark Spincer. 'We’re delighted that sponsors DFS are providing us with another fantastic star prize of a trip to New York which is guaranteed to be an added incentive for ladies to pull out all stops, get dressed up, enjoy a great day out at the races and have the chance of securing the coveted Best Dressed Lady crown.' The second day of the St Leger race meeting, Ladies Day brings more than 60,000 racing fans flocking to Doncaster as well as some of the world's biggest racehorse owners. Among them is Sir Alex Ferguson, who was spotted enjoying the action on day one, Saudi Arabia's Prince Khalid Abdullah and Her Majesty the Queen, whose bay thoroughbred Sea Shanty will tackle the Crownhotel-bawtry.com Handicap at 3.45pm today.

"Seeking answers: Abraham Pishevar, 18, died August 25 in a plane crash with three other Case Western Reserve University students. Now his family wants to know if his death was related to the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity . Family members of one of the four Case Western Reserve University students killed in a tragic plane crash last month are considering a wrongful death lawsuit over suspicions the young men took flight as part of a fraternity recruitment event. An attorney for Abraham Pishevar's family says the 18-year-old posted to social media messages entitled 'Rush' in which he documented the doomed plane's ascent August 25--Pishevar's first day of college classes. Pishevar died not long after takeoff along with pilot William Felten, 20, Lucas Marcelli, 20, and John Hill, 18 when the plane struck the ground and smashed through a fence at a suburban Cleveland airport. According to ABC News, Pishevar posted to Snapchat before the crash: 'About to go on a night flight' with the headline 'Rush.' The plane was rented online from a local flying club for four hours starting at 8:30 p.m. on Aug. 25. None of the club's employees were at the airport when the men arrived at Cuyahoga County Airport in the Cleveland suburb of Richmond Heights. Felten and Marcelli were both second-year students and members of the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity. Pishevar and Hill were both freshman. 'The Snapchat photo that you've seen which has a heading 'Rush' on it goes to what Abraham's state of mind was,' Pishevar family attorney Jamie Lebovitz told ABC. Court docs reveal the family wants to learn more about the nature of the nighttime flight by seeking fraternity records and documents from the flying club that rented the Cessna 172R to Felten, a licensed pilot of about one year. 'Sightseeing': The four young men in the Cessna 172R died at an airport in suburban Cleveland. The other victims were pilot William Felten, 20, Lucas Marcelli, 20, and John Hill, 18. Felten and Marcelli were members of the Zeta Beta Tau frat . Rushing? Freshman Abraham Pishevar boarded the plane on the night of his first ever day as a student at Case Western. His family had no idea he may have been interested in joining a fraternity, but court documents reveal he wrote a post titled 'Rush' as he took to the air August 25 . Zeta Beta Tau has been quick to distance the fraternity from the tragic event, telling ABC in a statement: 'We have been assured … that the flight was not a recruitment event.' As they seek to learn more about what brought about his death, the Pishevars are only now learning that Abraham was even interested in joining a fraternity. 'Abraham was starting out his first day at Case Western when this tragedy happened,' said his aunt Bita Pishevar Haynes told ABC. 'No one from our family knew he was even rushing.' The NTSB report does not indicate what might have caused the crash but lists details of what occurred before and after. The NTSB investigation could take a year or more to complete. According to the report released August 29: . Tragedy: Pilot William Felten, 20, (right) had his license for about a year, official said. The plane crashed in nearby Willoughby Hills at 9:48 pm Residents reported hearing an explosion as they raced toward the crash site and that the fuselage quickly caught fire, trapping the men inside . Warning signs: At around 9:45pm, Felten asked the ground controller for clearance to take off. About four minutes later, the controller informed Felten he was taxiing to the wrong runway. Felten apologized and the controller directed him to the approach end of the correct runway. The plane was rented online from a local flying club for four hours starting at 8:30 pm on August 25. None of the club's employees were at the airport when the men arrived at Cuyahoga County Airport in the Cleveland suburb of Richmond Heights. Witnesses said they saw the four men approach the plane, a single-engine Cessna, around 9pm and that one of the men had a small suitcase. One witness said the plane sat with the engine running for about 30 minutes with the men on board. At around 9:45pm., Felten asked the ground controller for clearance to take off. About four minutes later, the controller informed Felten he was taxiing to the wrong runway. Felten apologized and the controller directed him to the approach end of the correct runway. Felten radioed the controller two minutes after starting takeoff that 'they were not climbing fast and they wanted to immediately make a left turn to turn around.' The plane became airborne about 2,000 feet down the 5,100-foot runway, the controller said. The plane crashed in nearby Willoughby Hills at 9:48 pm Residents reported hearing an explosion as they raced toward the crash site and that the fuselage quickly caught fire, trapping the men inside.

"A luxury interior design shop has sparked outrage by advertising six full-time jobs which did not pay a penny in wages – and claiming more than 150 people still applied. Campaigners have reported the 35-hour-a-week ‘internships’ at Edinburgh’s Casa Morada boutique, which sells £400 lights, £500 cowhide rugs and £200 stone ornaments, to government investigators amid concerns they may have been illegal. Yet the firm’s founder insisted the hours were fair because ‘we all have 168 hours every week’ – including the ones in which people sleep - and attacked the 'hypocrites' who exposed her scheme. Scroll down for video . Shock: Six full-time, six-month roles were advertised at Edinburgh interior design shop Casa Morada (left) - without paying a penny in wages. Campaigners reported the adverts on Gumtree to HM Revenue and Customs . The six placements, each six months long and requiring the ‘employees’ to work 35 hours a week for free, were advertised last month on the classified adverts site Gumtree. Three of the employees would have worked from home while the other three would work from a rota which involved starting at 9am, five days a week. The only expenses to be paid were for travel, despite the interns designing products, drawing up technical plans and meeting suppliers and tradesmen. If all 5,460 hours of work were paid for at the minimum wage for over-21s, they would total more than £34,000. The adverts were first spotted by Edinburgh-based artist Eugene MacDonald, who wrote to complain – but claimed he received an ‘eye-wateringly rude’ reply from the firm’s founder Eva Serrano. Shocking: The adverts on Gumtree, which have since been taken down, said candidates would start at 9am for five days a week and work full-time for six months without any pay. The internships are no longer on offer . Posting the exchange on Facebook, he said she wrote: ‘I fully expect you to proof [sic] to me that you can actually be an asset to my business before I invest seriously in you with a full time contract. ‘I deliberately place UNPAID intern positions precisely to sort out the mediocre (you) who will never apply, from the formidable. ‘You will never go far with your present mindset. Rest assured of that. 150 CVs now in, from as far as London, and counting.’ When contacted by a student newspaper in Edinburgh, Ms Serrano insisted her employment practices were not illegal or immoral. She initially told The Student: ‘We don’t believe that working 35 hours per week does in any form disadvantage students from poorer backgrounds because we all have universal access to 168 hours in every week of the year.' Upmarket: The boutique, which sells £400 lights and £500 cowhide rugs, defended its decision on Facebook . Her comments sparked a ferocious backlash on Facebook and the adverts were later removed. The firm said the internships would no longer be offered, adding: 'Should we wish to explore them at all, it will be within the realm of university established graduate work experience programmes, under their terms and conditions, to avoid any further misunderstandings, offence or outrage.' But Ms Serrano defended her logic - and attacked the 'hypocritical' students who exposed it. She claimed 'the CVs keep coming', telling MailOnline: 'We were merely responding to students, graduates and universities increasing demand for voluntary work experience internships, which must be, by the university's own terms, necessarily full time and six months, since internships are now compulsory in many university degrees throughout Europe. 'Hence the hypocrisy in the story. The same students who have been outraged by Casa Morada will be complaining to their universities about the lack of internship opportunities in the market, and pressing for closer collaboration between university and employers.' Gordon Maloney, the President of Scotland's National Union of Students, condemned the adverts. He told MailOnline: 'Even worse than offering up these positions which are clearly full-time jobs, and borders on illegal practice, is the downright patronising response from the company involved. Tall order: The adverts asked for people who were already highly proficient with graphic design software . Last year the government launched a clampdown on top firms who were using unpaid interns to fill jobs. Officials wrote to 200 firms – some of which were believed to include household names – which could be fined, ‘named and shamed’ and even prosecuted if they were failing to pay workers the national minimum wage. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills announced the new crackdown amid fears that interns are being exploited and made to work for free in effectively full-time, paid occupations. Employment minister Jo Swinson (above) said: ‘Far too many young people have been exploited on long-term unpaid internships. Anyone who is a worker is entitled to be paid at least the minimum wage, including if they are an intern.’ 'Students work incredibly hard for their degrees, and make an invaluable contribution to all sorts of employers and organisations once they’ve graduated. 'To denigrate all those who, quite rightly, refuse to work a full-time job for no pay, is simply offensive.' The campaign group Intern Aware has reported the adverts to HM Revenue and Customs, which will be duty-bound to investigate whether they are illegal. Campaigns manager Chris Hares told MailOnline: 'Unless you meet one of a small number of exemptions (such as a charity) then if you’re doing real work, you should be paid for it. 'So if you’re expected to work full-time, have set responsibilities and are contributing value to the employer’s business, it’s highly likely that you qualify as at least a ""worker"" and have a right to at least minimum wage. 'In this case, there are a long list of duties and responsibilities for each position so we have reported these adverts to HMRC for investigation as they potentially breach the law. The group is pushing for a change in the law so all unpaid internships longer than four weeks would be automatically illegal. Mr Hares added: 'At the moment, the law just isn’t clear enough to help businesses or interns get this right.' An HMRC spokesman told MailOnline: 'We look into every allegation that's passed to us, but we can't comment on individual cases.'","35-hour-a-week roles posted on Gumtree by Edinburgh shop Casa Morada .

"After four days of  searching, officials believe that have finally captured and killed the mountain lion that viciously mauled a 6-year-old boy over the weekend. The 65-pound juvenile male mountain lion was caught near the Picchetti Ranch Zinfandel Trail, and shot with a rifle after it began showing unusually aggressive behavior towards the dogs who located it and chased it into a tree. This all happened just 130 yards from the site where the boy was attacked on Sunday afternoon. Scroll down for video . Caught and killed: The mountain lion who attacked a child over the weekend has been captured and killed . Heroes: The dogs (above) that managed to locate the cat then chased the animal into a tree, where officials had no choice but to shoot it due to its 'unusual behavior' On the loose: A look at the lion's paw prints . Officials, however, are still trying to figure out what caused the animal to behave in this manner. 'Everything about [the attack] was so vastly beyond our scope, beyond any statistical reason why lions do what they do, that there is no way to explain why he attacked,' said Lt. Patrick Foy of the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. And there is also the possibility this is not the same lion. 'I think it's very, very highly likely, but we can't put a 100 percent stamp on it until we get the DNA,' Foy said. More than half of California is considered prime mountain lion habitat, and an estimated 4,000 to 6,000 cougars roam statewide. Clean up: The Picchetti Ranch Open Space trails remain closed while Fish and Wildlife officials pick up mountain lion traps . Long search: Officials spent four days combing the park in hopes of locating the lion . Officials had originally just wanted to tranquilize the animal, but its behavior made that option impossible. 'No one at the department wanted to destroy this animal but protecting public safety is a first and foremost priority,' said the Dept. of Fish and Wildlife in a statement. The animal is now on its way to Sacramento for a full DNA test to see if it is the same cat that attacked the boy, and to be tested for rabies or other diseases. Picchetti Ranch Open Space trails remain closed meanwhile, while Fish and Wildlife officials pick up all the mountain lion traps they put down over the course of the week, according to ABC 7. Danger: A sign at the park warns visitors of what to do should they encounter a lion . Proof: The lion is now en route to Sacramento, where its DNA will be tested to see if it matches that found on the shirt of the boy who was attacked . There have been 13 verified mountain lion attacks in California between 1986 and 2013, resulting in three fatalities, aged 35, 40 and 56. The last attack was in July 2012 when a lion attacked a 63-year-old man as he camped near the Yuba River in Nevada County. But the victim managed to fight the animal off. 'It's quite rare,' Lt. Patrick Foy of the state Department of Fish and Wildlife told the LA Times. 'People are far more likely to be attacked by a dog.' Even though lions tend to avoid humans, about half of California is mountain lion habitat, so residents and visitors should be prepared. If you come face-to-face with a lion, you should stand tall, wave your arms, shout aggressively and fight back, Foy said. People are also discouraged from hiking or biking alone or during lions' most active times, which are dawn, dusk and night. Residents living in mountain lion country are also encouraged to deer-proof their land, cut back bushes to reduce hiding places and bring their pets and pet food inside at night. The young boy was among a group of 10 - comprised of his parents, another pair of parents and kids - hiking at the Picchetti Ranch Open Space Preserve when the attack occurred on Sunday. The boy's father told investigators his son was about 10 feet ahead of the group when the lion 'came out of nowhere' and attacked the boy. He then dragged the boy to a nearby bush. The boy's father and the other male adult in the group shouted and acted aggressively toward the mountain lion to scare it away. 'He's very, very lucky that the parents were so close,' Lt. Foy said at the time. Hours after they managed to carry the boy to safety, teams found track marks showing that showed the lion continued to follow the group after they had fought it off. The boy is expected to recover from his injuries, which were described as moderate and included puncture wounds and scratches. The boy's family has repeatedly declined to publicly discuss the ordeal. There have been 13 verified mountain lion attacks in California between 1986 and 2013, resulting in three fatalities. The youngest victim ever attacked was a five-year-old girl in Caspers Wilderness Park in 1986, but she escaped with her life.","A mountain lion believed to have attacked a child this weekend has been captured and killed .

"Attack: Tinika Campbell, now 19, was today branded one of Britain's most dangerous women . A teenage girl was today branded one of Britain’s most dangerous women - after she mauled and beat a man to death when her cannabis smoking made her believe he was possessed by the devil. Tinika Campbell, then 17, sank her teeth into the head of 36-year-old Khalid Kassian Hassan in a flat in Longsight, Manchester, then punched him repeatedly after harbouring a deranged belief he was about to mount a demonic attack upon her. She also set her pit bull dog on Mr Hassan when he tried to run from her clutches. Police were then called to the home after neighbours heard Mr Hassan ‘screaming for help’. Officers found Campbell kneeling astride him in the doorway, head-butting Iraqi-born Mr Hassan and calling him a ‘dirty b******’. As officers attempted to tend to his mutilated body, Campbell briefly paused her assault before she stamped on his face and then used the pit bull to ward off police while she fled. The teenager then broke into a nearby office and barricaded herself inside using furniture to block the door. But she was arrested 20 minutes later when police were forced to overpower her with a Taser weapon, during the terrifying siege in the early hours of August 31, 2012. When Campbell was transferred to nearby Longsight Police Station, she began ‘roaring’ and talking about God in her cell - before she bit into the hand of an officer and refused to let go. Mr Hassan died at the scene. When his body was examined the pathologist discovered a catalogue of injuries including a fractured nose, four fractured ribs, bruises and cuts to his head and face, a broken neck bone and severe injuries to his left leg consistent with dog bites. Investigation: Police outside the house in Longsight, Manchester, where the attack happened in August 2012. Officers found Campbell kneeling astride him in the doorway, head-butting her victim in the face . He had also suffered several bites from a human on his head and left hand. At Manchester Crown Court it was revealed that Campbell was suffering from schizoaffective disorder exacerbated by her frequent use of cannabis and legal high drugs. It led to abnormal beliefs in which she thought everyone was possessed by the devil. Details of the case emerged as Campbell, now 19, was given a life sentence and branded ‘extremely dangerous’ after she admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. She will have to serve a minimum jail term of five years after her not guilty plea to murder was accepted. She already had 18 convictions for 27 offences, including assault and robbery. Neil Usher, prosecuting, said: ‘She said she couldn’t trust anybody. She told a doctor at stage during the early hours she had took the dog for a walk. ‘She insisted she had not gone for the purposes of killing. She had wandered the streets and found herself at his address by chance. ‘Then she said for no reason her dog started gnawing at the trousers of the victim at which point she believed he was the devil and was trying to attack her and she had to defend herself. Shocking incident: Campbell was arrested when police were forced to overpower her with a Taser weapon . ‘This led to the attack. She has continued to experience delusional thoughts and violence and other challenging behaviour. Her condition is exacerbated by the effects of illicit psychotic drugs including cannabis.’ As well as hearing Mr Hassan’s futile screams for mercy, neighbours reported Campbell telling her dog to ‘sick him’ and ‘get him’ when they contacted the police. The court heard that in the days before . the attack Campbell, who had been in care since the age of 14 but was . regaining contact with her parents, was displaying unusual behaviour. 'She can be classed as extremely dangerous. Clearly this offence is particularly grave. I say that with no hesitation' Judge Michael Henshell . She had been singing gospel songs and praising God, grabbed one man in the street and shook his head while saying ‘he’s the devil, he’s the devil’ and sprayed graffiti on gravestones at a cemetery. After she was sent to the medium-security Edenfield Centre in Prestwich, Manchester. following Mr Hassan’s killing, she continued to act violently. Campbell even misused legal highs while under the care of staff and on another occasion attacked an elderly female resident. William Staunton, defending, conceded that Campbell was a dangerous offender and a serious risk to members of the public. He added: ‘We can’t ignore the dreadful way this man died. She appears to know she was responsible for the death of this man. ‘While in police custody she went in to prayer and sought forgiveness. It was a brutal and frenzied attack, but one which was committed during an episode.’ Response: Police were called to the flat in Longsight after neighbours heard Mr Hassan 'screaming for help' Under guidance from Dr Fareed Bashir, Campbell’s psychiatrist at the Edenfield Centre, Judge Michael Henshell ruled a prison sentence would be more appropriate than a hospital order because of her risk of harm. Judge Henshell said: ‘There were no eye witnesses to the fatal attack, but it is clear from the evidence at the scene that he must have been attacked initially in his own home and during the attack fled to a nearby house, leaving a trail of blood which stretched form his flat to the hallway of his neighbour’s house. 'She said for no reason her dog started gnawing at the trousers of the victim at which point she believed he was the devil and was trying to attack her and she had to defend herself' Neil Usher, prosecuting . ‘A neighbour heard a disturbance at 5am with sounds including him crying for help and the defendant urging the dog to attack him. When the police opened the door the scene that confronted them was truly horrific. ‘Her appearance was that she looked deranged - her hair was matted with blood and she was breathing heavily and muttering to herself. It was clear he was already dead. ‘There have been a significant history of behavioural problems since childhood. She began to exhibit psychotic symptoms at around the age of 16 where she could be volatile and violent. ‘In answer to the question of dangerousness I can say most certainly she is. She can be classed as extremely dangerous. Clearly this offence is particularly grave. I say that with no hesitation. ‘The harm here is exceptionally grave, the culpability is diminished by her mental condition. I have no hesitation that a life sentence is justified. She will be on licence for life and liable to recall at any time.’ Mr Hassan had been living in Britain since 2001 but had recently been refused asylum and was looking at ways of staying in the country.","Tinika Campbell, 17, sank her teeth into head of Khalid Kassian Hassan .

"A CIA spokesman says a new intelligence assessment estimates that the Islamic State group can muster between 20,000 and 31,500 fighters across Iraq and Syria, up from a previous figure of 10,000. The new assessment is based on a review of intelligence reports from May to August. It is larger than the 20,000 figure being used by many outside experts. The CIA estimates that 2,000 of those fighters are from Western nations . Scroll down for videos . Leader: A man purported to be the reclusive leader of the militant Islamic State Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has made what would be his first public appearance at a mosque in the center of Iraq's second city, Mosul, according to a video recording posted on the Internet on July 5, 2014 . Swollen ranks: A resident of Tabqa city touring the streets on a motorcycle waves an Islamist flag in celebration after Islamic State militants took over Tabqa air base, in nearby Raqqa city August 24, 2014 . 'This new total reflects an increase in members because of stronger recruitment since June following battlefield successes and the declaration of a caliphate,' CIA spokesman Todd Ebitz said. CIA spokesman Ryan Trapani says the new total reflects stronger recruitment by the extremist group since June following battlefield successes and the group's declaration of a caliphate. He says the revised number also reflects 'greater battlefield activity, and additional intelligence.' According to CNN, more than 15,000 fighters from 80 countries around the world, including 2,000 from Westerners, have gone to Syria to join the militants. Joined by foreign fighters: A fighter of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or ISIS) holds an ISIL flag and a weapon on a street in the city of Mosul, June 23, 2014 . Divergent groups: Iraqi Shiite militia fighters hold the Islamic State flag as they celebrate after breaking the siege of Amerli by Islamic State militants, September 1, 2014 . The revised figure comes a day after President Obama outlined his plans to 'dismantle and ultimately destroy' ISIS. On Wednesday, Obama laid out plans to go after Islamic State militants with possible sustained airstrikes and associated military actions designed to neutralize the foe. He insisted that despite ISIS declaring a caliphate, controlling large areas in Iraq and Syria and calling itself Islamic State, it is not a legitimate 'state.' The president wants to train Syrian rebels to serve as ground troops against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. However, after three years of civil war, there are many diverse groups fighting President Bashar al-Assad - and one other - ranging from moderates to extremists. 'There’s a lot of skepticism about this piece of the president’s strategy,' Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, a member of the House Intelligence Committee told The New York Times. 'The so-called moderate rebels have often been very immoderate and ineffective.'","A new CIA intelligence assessment estimates ISIS can gather between 20,000 and 21,500 fighters .

"A New South Wales MP's latest attempt to ban the burqa across the state has been branded anti-Islamic and a political stunt. Christian Democratic Party leader Fred Nile introduced his private member's bill in state parliament on Thursday that would prohibit the wearing of the burqa and other face coverings in public. It follows similar bans in Belgium and France, and comes after his failed attempt at blacklisting face coverings in 2010. Christian Democratic Party MP Fred Nile has introduced a bill that would see the ban of burqas . While Mr Nile stressed that his bill's text did not include the words 'burqa' or 'Muslim', much of his speech to parliament about the plan focused on the burqa. He said the measures came at an 'opportune' time after Wednesday's arrest in Queensland of two men allegedly linked to terrorist groups in Syria. 'We also face the new Islamic State (IS) terrorist threat, whose black uniforms for both men and women include face coverings to prevent identification,' he told the upper house. Labor MP Amanda Fazio said the measures were 'anti-Islamic' and had more to do with Mr Nile's bid for re-election in March. His political opponents, like Labor MP Amanda Fazio, said the measures were 'anti-Islamic' 'These measures are the opposite of everything we're trying to achieve in Australia in terms of being inclusive and having a harmonious society where we respect difference,' she told AAP. Silma Ihram, from Australian Muslim Women's Association, branded the move as 'unfortunate'. '[This] is only going to further traumatise members of the [Muslim] community who are absolutely innocent and have every right to wear the fashion of their choice,"" she said. Under Mr Nile's plan, a person who covers their face in public would face a $550 fine and a person who forces someone else to cover their face would be hit with a $1,100 penalty. The plan allows faces to be covered under certain conditions, such as during a parade or if 'Sydney is suddenly hit by a blizzard and ski masks are the latest fashion', the MP said. Greens MP Mehreen Faruqi said the move was another example of 'conservative men trying to control what women do'. Mr Nile's move comes after two Queensland men, Agim Kruezi (left) and Omar Succrieh (right) were arrested for charges of terrorism . John Blaxland, an intelligence and security expert at the Australian National University, said authorities already had powers to ask for face coverings to be removed. He said Mr Nile's plan was unlikely to be supported by the security community. Comment has been sought from NSW Premier Mike Baird. Debate on the bill was adjourned. It comes as two Queensland men were charged on Wednesday for preparing to send fighters to join the conflict in Syria after a raid on a Islamic bookstore, a gym and seven other premises in Logan and Brisbane. The arrests followed a year-long counter-terrorism investigation by Australian Federal Police and state police. Omar Succarieh, who is the brother of Australia's first suicide bomber to die in Syria, was charged with providing funds to the terrorist organisation Jabhat al-Nusra. The 31-year-old, from Kuraby, was also charged with preparing for incursions into Syria. Further, Agim Kruezi, 21, from Boronia Heights, was charged with preparing for incursions into Syria with the intention of engaging in hostile activities as well as recruiting fighters to join the conflict.","Fred Nile has introduced a bill which prohibits the wearing of the burqa .

"A seven-year-old girl narrowly avoided choking after she took a bite of a KFC chicken burger containing a metal nut. Leah Neat asked for some of her father's burger while on a family outing at the KFC in Gravesend, Kent. But when she passed it back to Daniel Neat, 35, he was shocked to find a piece of metal in the middle of the burger. A metal bolt was found inside a burger at a KFC in Gravesend, Kent, by Daniel Neat, 35 . Mother Sharon Neat, 35, said: 'It was my husband's burger but you know what children are like. 'My daughter said 'dad can I have a bite' so she did and when she passed it back he said 'there's a nut in that'. 'I said 'people can be allergic to that' and my husband said 'no, it's a metal nut'. 'It's not the sort of thing you expect to find in your burger. It really has put the children off eating there again.' Leah Neat, seven, narrowly avoided choking on the metal nut after taking a bite of her father's burger . She spent more than £35 on two barbecue pulled chicken meals, three boneless banquets, two barbecue wraps and one lunch box meal for her three children, husband, grandmother and uncle. Mrs Neat was told a full investigation would be launched but the mother-of-three has claimed she won't step back into the store in Kent. A KFC spokesman said: 'We take food safety extremely seriously and immediately launched an investigation into the matter to determine whether the object originated in store, which is ongoing. 'Nonetheless, as soon we were made aware of the situation we apologised on the spot and offered a full refund to the Neat family, which they accepted in the restaurant. 'We would like to reassure customers that our Valley Drive restaurant achieved a food hygiene rating of five out of five stars meaning that the business was found to have very good hygiene standards.'

"Troy Holliday, from Blackburn, was found unresponsive in his parents' double bed after all three slept there together, an inquest heard . A healthy baby boy may have been accidentally smothered as he and his parents all slept together in a double bed, an inquest was told. Troy Holliday, who was seven weeks old, had been taken from his moses basket into his parents' bed for an early morning feed less than two hours before he was found lying, unresponsive, next to his mother. The baby, who was discovered by his father as he got up for work, wasn't breathing, and had blood trickling from his nose, and was declared dead by doctors soon after when efforts to resuscitate him failed, the hearing in Blackburn, Lancashire, was told. Troy, a thriving baby boy from Blackburn, had been put to bed the night before in his moses basket next to his parents' bed, and woke at 1am for a feed and again at 4.20am. A police statement read to the court said the baby's mother, Holly Bell, 29, woke her partner up to prepare the feed at 4.20am before feeding her small son herself. Troy's father last saw Miss Bell holding Troy as he went back to sleep, before his alarm woke him up at 6am. Mr Holliday had been sleeping on the far side of the bed next to a wardrobe, Miss Bell was in the middle, and the baby on the side of the bed between his mother and his moses basket, the coroner was told. The baby's father noticed his son lying unresponsive on his back, with his feet under the duvet, beside his mother.  Troy wasn't breathing and had blood trickling from his nose. Mr Holliday dialled 999 and began to administer CPR, but the baby was pronounced dead at Blackburn hospital at 6.49am that day. Miss Bell's aunt, Margaret Garth, 55, who also lived at the house, told the inquest Troy was a healthy baby. 'Troy was a thriving baby who woke up at regular times like clockwork,' she said. 'He was doing really well, no illness, no coughs, no nothing - he was coming on well.  There were no illnesses.' She said she had made her home smoke-free before the baby was born, and insisted on Troy's parents, both of whom smoked, doing so outdoors. And Mrs Garth said the room was kept to an optimal temperature which the baby's father was 'meticulous' about checking, which ruled out the possibility of the baby overheating. Police said they had spoken to the baby's parents about the incident but had not taken any action against them. Troy, pictured with his parents Gareth Holliday, 29, and Holly Bell, 29, was an otherwise healthy little boy . Paediatric pathologist Melanie Newbold told the inquest that tests had found nothing wrong with Troy, and said that in the past, the baby's death would have been attributed to 'cot death'. She said the term 'unascertained death' was used more now, but said certain factors including sleeping not in a cot and sleeping with a parent were known to be linked to a higher incidence of such deaths. Recording an open verdict, coroner Michael Singleton said that the infant may have been a victim of 'accidental overlaying', where the child is smothered by a larger individual sleeping on top of them. He told the family that because an adult turns in the night, one could obstruct a baby's airways and the baby would not have the ability to push back. Mr Singleton said: 'I recognise that one possibility is that of accidentally overlaying. I cannot eliminate that as a possibility, but certainly no evidence that would confirm that. 'Whilst it might be a natural cause of death, nothing can confirm that, and in these circumstances it therefore leaves me with no alternative than to reach an open verdict.' The coroner added: 'I know you wanted an explanation; that I have been unable to give you. 'There is nothing I can say that will go close to reflecting the tragedy of this situation other than you have my heartfelt condolences.'","Troy Holliday was taken from his moses basket into parents' bed for feed .

"Tesco caused outrage yesterday over plans to kill a pied wagtail which has been fluttering round one of its supermarkets - but backtracked when a BBC wildlife presenter intervened. The seven inch tall female pied wagtail has 'delighted' customers by flying around the aisles since it fluttered into a Tesco Extra store in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk several weeks ago. Staff have tried in vain to get it outside by laying down traps, using nets, opening windows and have even attempted to lure it out with food. Scroll down for video . This pied wagtail (pictured) has narrowly avoided being shot after taking up residence in a Norfolk supermarket . But the black and white bird has evaded all attempts to get it to leave and has defiantly stayed in the Norfolk shop. Store bosses took the drastic step of seeking permission to have it shot over fears that it poses a health and safety risk. The conservation body Natural England granted a licence allowing Tesco to bring in a professional sniper to shoot and kill the small bird on the grounds of 'protecting public health'. But Tesco faced a storm of protest after a local newspaper revealed that the bird faced being gunned down. Bernadette Tait, 28, of Gorleston near Great Yarmouth, who shops at the store, led a social media campaign on Twitter to save the bird. She said: 'It made me very upset and I felt I needed to try and do something so I re-tweeted the story and tweeted as many people and companies as I could. 'I didn't want a riot outside Tesco but I felt that there was someone out there that had the skills to catch this bird without killing it. ' After she launched the campaign, BBC wildlife presenter Chris Packham, 53, who has presented nature programme Springwatch since 2009 then became involved and demanded that the bird be spared. He tweeted a message to Tesco, saying: 'Can I ask you to rethink the shooting of the wagtail in Gt Yarmouth store please. I'm sure the bird could be caught.' Tesco East Anglia replied in a tweet, saying: 'We've tried for a number of weeks to catch the bird, definitely our preference to catch and release. Any advice welcome.' Customers and local residents also took to local newspaper websites to vent their anger at the decision. Paul Gilham wrote: 'Pity you can't bring in marksmen/women to take out a few hundred seagulls instead of a rare beautiful bird like this. Shame on you tesco's!' Another shopper said: 'We live in a rural area, the occasional bird dropping in or amongst our food is not that unusual. Just wash it off for goodness sake. But no, there's profit at stake here so a knuckle dragging ott response is deemed necessary. It's Asda for me and my family from now on.' The bird is believed to be roosting around the store's café and is thought to be surviving on crumbs on the floor instead of its usual diet of insects. Pied wagtails are birds protected under the 1981 Wildlife and Countryside Act. As a protected bird, anyone who kills one could be fined up to £5,000 or jailed for a maximum of six months if they do not have a licence. As the store is open for 24 hours a day, the bird was going to be shot on a Sunday when the store is closed between 10am and 4pm. Mr Packham then put Tesco bosses in touch with experts from the British Trust of Ornithology(BTO), who said they hope to find a way to remove the bird alive. BBC wildlife presenter Chris Packham (pictured) intervened after hearing the protected bird was to be shot . Mr Packham said: 'Shame on Natural England. They should have put Tesco in touch with the BTO and not granted the licence in the first place. 'We must give Tesco due credit for doing the right thing. For those who say it is just a common bird and they are not in danger I say it is symbolic. 'It is one little bird, but it shows the value we put on our wildlife. If we say it doesn't matter about that one then where will we stop? 'We should not just reach for the gun. In this country we have a wealth of experts to go to before resorting to the gun.' Following the intervention, Tesco East Anglia tweeted: 'Happy to liaise with @-BTO, we're going to explore other options over the next few weeks and will keep you updated.' Packham responded on Twitter: 'All @Tesco are going to work with @-BTO to try again to catch the Wag' and the guns are stood down. Result and thank you all for lobbying.' Ms Tait, who started the campaign, said she was 'very pleased' that the apparent intervention of Chris Packham had led to the bird getting a reprieve. She added: 'I've seen the bird playing and cleaning it's self on top of the freezers when doing my shopping and not once was I concerned about hygiene but thought how beautiful it was. 'My nine-year-old daughter is also pleased that there is hopefully a happy ending to this story.' A Tesco spokesman said: 'Our goal is always to release any birds which have found their way into our stores, while ensuring we maintain our high standards of hygiene. 'In spite of repeated efforts to free the bird including laying down traps, deploying nets and opening windows, we have been unsuccessful so far. 'We're going to continue to try to release the bird over the next few weeks.' The Tesco spokesman was unable to say if other birds flying loose in stores had ever been shot. A spokesman for Natural England said licences, such as the one granted to Tesco, were issued 'occasionally' but only when environment bosses were 'satisfied' all other methods had been exhausted. The spokesman said: 'Fouling by birds can contaminate foods destined for human consumption, constituting a serious health risk. 'As such, licences are occasionally issued to remove birds to protect public health and safety, where those measures do not harm the conservation status of the species. 'Natural England must be satisfied all reasonable non-lethal methods - such as trapping and scaring - have been tried and proven ineffective before a licence to remove the bird is issued.' Tesco Extra in Great Yarmouth (pictured) where a bird has narrowly avoided being killed by a sniper after an outcry by residents, customers and BBC wildlife presenter Chris Packham . The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds said the loss of the bird would not affect the breed's population and it was not one of 'conservation concern'. A spokesman for the bird charity added: 'In rare situations, when all non-lethal solutions have been fully explored, a license can be issued by Natural England to allow an individual or organisation to shoot a bird that is considered to be causing a significant nuisance. 'In this case, the licence may have been issued in recognition of the health and safety risks caused by a bird in a major superstore. The female pied wagtail has so far resisted attempts to lure it out and is surviving on crumbs on the cafe floor . 'Pied wagtails are not a species of conservation concern, and the small number of licenses granted for this purpose will not result in a significant population decline in the UK. 'We would always ask that an organisation takes measures to ensure that, where they pose a risk, birds don't enter their premises. 'In the unfortunate event that they do, it is essential that they make every effort to resolve the issue non-lethally before considering this type of action.'","Small pied wagtail has been flying around store for several weeks .

"Two British researchers have 'disappeared' in Qatar after being harassed and followed by plain clothes police, according to a human rights group. Researcher Krishna Upadhyaya, 52, and photographer Ghimire Gundev, 36, from London, were due to fly from Doha to London on Sunday but failed to arrive at the airport. The Global Network for Rights and Development (GNRD) said the pair - who had been looking in to reports of poor treatment of Nepalese migrant workers as Qatar prepares to stage the football World Cup in 2022 - had 'feared they might be in danger' after being harassed by police and had decided to leave the country when they disappeared. Missing: Krishna Upadhyaya (left) and Ghimire Gundev (right) were due to fly to London from Doha, Qatar, on Sunday but did not board the plane. They had feared for their safety after being followed by plain-clothed police . The Foreign Office said it is aware of reports of one missing British national. A statement from GNRD, based in Norway, said it 'holds Qatari authorities responsible for the security and safety of its kidnapped employees'. Ala Abu Dakka, a programme manager at the NGO, said staff were working tirelessly to locate the pair. 'It has been four days now and we are still putting pressure on the Qatari authorities to disclose where they are,' he said. 'We do believe that they have an idea of where they are because they were being followed by plain clothes police. 'They were being harassed by police before they disappeared. They were very worried and feared they might be in danger. 'We told them to leave Qatar for their safety to avoid the situation we have now. They were due to fly to London and on to Norway. 'We are very concerned about their welfare. We think they are being investigated in unknown circumstances.' Search: Their employers believe officials in the Qatari city (pictured) are deliberately withholding information . The pair arrived in the country on August 27 and were due to stay up to one week but reported their fears on Saturday. Mr Gundev's family in both Nepal and Europe called for the immediate release of the 'loving father of two'. In a statement they said: 'He is a kind-hearted man who is always interested in helping the disabled and poor. 'He is indirectly or directly involved personally in many social-welfare works in Nepal helping people understand their human rights.' GNRD said it is prepared to take legal action against Qatari authorities.","Britons were due to fly from Doha to London when they disappeared .

"A unique collection of images beautifully illustrating the southern hemisphere's most amazing wildlife will be featured in an Australian gallery exhibition throughout October and November. Photographers from across the globe will be vying for the Australian Geographic ANZANG Nature Photographer of the Year award, which recognises the most outstanding images taken from Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and Antarctica across 10 categories. Curators from the South Australian Museum will exhibit the works from October 10, before a winner is awarded the top prize of $10,000. In considering entries judges will take in to account the region in which the image was taken, as well as technique, aesthetics, and the artistic and unique quality of all images. South Australian Museum Exhibition Manager Tim Gilchrist said: 'Every image offers the viewer an opportunity to explore a new region or discover a new species they might never otherwise be introduced to.' He said the competition encourages awareness of biodiversity and conservation in a fascinating and important part of the world. The Editor-in-Chief of Australian Geographic Chrissie Goldrick said: 'This year's shortlist delivers a powerful statement about the diversity of the ANZANG region as perfectly executed portraits of miniscule invertebrates stand side by side with awe inspiring images of our largest and most majestic marine mammals.

"Andrew Raybould, 30, died of blood poisoning at Walsall Manor Hospital this February after being sent home from hospital  three times previously . A bus driver died of blood poisoning after being sent him home from hospital three times as doctors allegedly failed to diagnose his condition. In December 2011, Andrew Raybould had been suffering from severe stomach pains, nausea, vomiting and constipation. The 30-year-old was sent home from Walsall Manor Hospital three times by staff who didn't know what was wrong with him, his family claim. By the end of January 2012 he had lost two stone in weight and was in constant pain. He was once again admitted to hospital and was finally diagnosed with acute pancreatitis, acute renal failure and sepsis and admitted to intensive care, but died a few days later in early February. His family have now complained to the hospital trust charged with their son's care and hired lawyers to look at the case. The trust said it is investigating Mr Raybould's death and will liaise closely with his family. Mr Raybould's mother Maureen, 58, of Aldridge, in the West Midlands, said  her son's death has torn hers and her husband Geoff's world apart. She said: 'Geoff and I are heartbroken by Andrew's death and we are still struggling to come to terms with everything that has happened. 'It was awful watching him suffer in agony but we felt helpless as hospital staff kept discharging him without us being told the cause of his symptoms. 'When we were told that there was nothing more that could be done for our son it felt like our world came crashing down around us. 'He was only 30 and should have had a long and happy life ahead of him. 'We believe more could have been done by the hospital staff to diagnose Andrew's conditions quicker, meaning he would have had access to treatment.' She and her husband have hired Birmingham-based law firm Irwin Mitchell to determine whether the hospital could have done more to save their son's life. Mrs Raybould said: 'We just hope that lessons will be learned from any failures found in his care in the hope that no other parents have to go through the trauma of losing their child to a treatable condition.' Rebecca Risby, from law firm Irwin Mitchell, said the firm is looking into Mr Raybould's treatment by the hospital. Mr and Mrs Raybould have complained to the hospital trust and  hired a law firm to investigate their son's death, which they said has left them 'heartbroken' Within a month of being sent home from hospital, Mr Newbould had lost two stone in weight and was in constant pain. He was diagnosed with pancreatitis and sepsis when he was admitted to hospital once again . She said: 'This is a tragic case that has seen a young man's life cut short. 'It was not until Andrew became critically ill that pancreatitis and sepsis were diagnosed, by which time it was too late for him to undergo any treatment. 'We are investigating his care and will be contacting the trust in the coming weeks regarding the treatment provided to Andrew. 'Sepsis is a devastating condition which causes the major organs to shut down, but if caught early enough, it can be treated with intravenous antibiotics.' Mr Amir Khan, Medical Director at Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust, said: 'We are aware that there have been a number of concerns raised around the death of Mr Raybould whilst in our care. 'A formal complaint has been made through our Patient Relations service which we have taken very seriously and, as a result, have undertaken a full investigation and will continue to liaise closely with the family to share our findings.' Mr Newbould's family said that at 30 years old he should have had a long and happy life ahead of him .","Andrew Raybould, 30, had been suffering severe stomach pains, nausea, vomiting and constipation .

"A 14-year-old Florida boy was discovered dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in a middle school bathroom Wednesday night. According to Seminole County Sheriff's Office, the child's mother drove to Greenwood Lakes Middle School in Lake Mary to pick up her son at around 5pm, but could not find him. The boy's family then set out scouring the neighborhood for him, but to no avail. Two hours later, the 14-year-old was reported missing to police. Tragic find: A 14-year-old boy attending Greenwood Lakes Middle School in Lake Mary, Florida, was discovered dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in a bathroom stall on campus . Sheriff's deputies were dispatched to Greenwood Lakes Middle School to search the campus, where they eventually came upon the missing boy, who was found in a men's room stall with a bullet wound to the head. The grisly discovery was made four hours after the middle-schooler was reported missing by his mother, WESH-TV reported. Greenwood Lakes Principal Debra Abbott released a statement on the school’s website and Facebook page announcing the student’s death. ‘Our thoughts and prayers are with the parents and family of the student as they deal with this tremendous personal loss. ‘Grief Counselors will be available on-site for students and staff beginning first thing this morning and will remain for as long as necessary,’ the open letter read. Police are now trying to determine how the teenager got his hands on a firearm. His name has not been released to the public. Channel 9 reported that it has been suggested that the boy might have been bullied, but the investigation into a possible motive is ongoing. Classes resumed as normal Thursday, but the school canceled its open house scheduled for the evening, along with all after-school activities. Parent Nadine Weaver told Orlando Sentinel that after hearing the tragic news of the boy’s death this morning, she rushed to Greenwood Lakes and pulled her daughter from class early. ‘I hate for her to miss another day of school but I just can't help it,’ Weaver said. ‘It could be someone that she knows personally, and how could I be at home [and] leave her here, just not knowing.’ • For confidential help, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 or click here . • For confidential support on suicide matters in the UK, call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90, visit a local Samaritans branch or click here .","The Greenwood Lakes Middle School student from Lake Mary, Florida, was discovered dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head .

"One post about an alleged child abduction on a mothers' group on Facebook has spawned widespread panic across Sydney's Northern Beaches. A member of Northern Beaches Mums' Group claims she saw a young girl - aged five or six years old - being taken from a bus shelter near Pittwater Golf Centre on Pittwater Road in Warriewood on Wednesday night. She posted her sighting on the page, saying it happened about 10.30pm. A concerned citizen posted on a mothers' group on Facebook, saying she had witnessed a child abduction . Urging people to be on the look out for anyone suspicious, the woman said the alleged offender was a man about 177cm tall who had dark hair, a moustache and was wearing black pants and a tracksuit top. The incident was reported to police who followed it up but did not find anything to substantiate the claims. But the post caused great alarm among the 6,000-plus members, with some driving through the streets in the Sydney suburb searching for the girl. Less than an hour after the alert went out, the post had amassed more than 340 comments, Manly Daily reported. The post caused widespread alarm but police have investigated the incident and saw there was no evidence to suggest it happened . Page founder Annika Coulson urged members not to post alleged crimes on social media but instead contact the police to ensure it was dealt with properly by the authorities. 'If you see a crime or something disturbing your first port of call is the police not Facebook,' Ms Coulson told News Corp. Northern beaches Local Area Command Acting Inspector Rob Winkler confirmed police had investigated the matter. '[We] have not found any information to suggest there was an abduction,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'We would always urge people if they have witnessed a crime to contact police immediately.' Insp Winkler said police have asked the administrator to remove the post as it was causing concern among the mothers group. Police have also said they had received phone calls from concerned citizens wanting to be updated on the situation.","A woman posted on Northern Beaches Mums' Group on Facebook .

"Businesses in a small Hawaii town are facing a slow-motion disaster as lava from Kilauea volcano oozes toward roads connecting them to the rest of the Big Island. Tiffany Edwards Hunt, who owns a surf shop with her husband, said the lava could hit buildings while smoke from fires sparked by the lava cold damage merchandise. If lava crosses the highway leading into town, it could cut the town off. 'There is the threat of his very historic, very quaint, eclectic village becoming a ghost town because of the isolation,' Hunt said after a meeting between merchants and county civil defense authorities. Scroll down for video... Lava is beginning to advances from the Kilauea volcano in Pahoa, Hawaii. Lava issued from several spots along a deep ground crack earlier this week, as shown by the distinct fingers of lava making up the flow front . Observatory scientists said lava from the Kilauea volcano could reach the Kaohe Homesteads in five to seven days if it continues advancing through cracks in the earth . The devastation wrought by the lava flow can be clearly seen here.  Only residents are allowed to enter the neighborhood because of the threat of lava flows . Kilauea has been erupting continuously since 1983. Scientists issued a warning last week when a lava flow that has been advancing through cracks in the earth for the past few months moved to within a mile of a rural subdivision. The flow since has slowed, but the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory said it could reach the northwest edge of Kaohe Homesteads in a day-and-a-half. The county hasn't ordered any evacuations, however. Officials also are preparing for the possibility that the lava will cross Highway 130, which links Pahoa and the sprawling, mostly rural district of Puna to Hilo. This could happen within weeks. Hawaii County Civil Defense Director Darryl Oliveira said lava has covered other major Big Island roads in the past, like a state highway in Kalapana and Chain of Craters Road which is partially in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Point of no return: This map shows the location of the volcano and the small community of Pahoa which could be cut off entirely if the lava flow crosses the nearby highway 130 road . Hawaii County Mayor Billy Kenoi addresses a crowd during a meeting to discuss Kilauea's lava flow . Hawaii officials say they're preparing for the possibility the lava may cross key roads and cut off a large part of the Big Islandís Puna district from the rest of the island within weeks . Downtown Pahoa, Hawaii. Surf shop co-owner Tiffany Edwards Hunt said there ís a threat Pahoa could become a ghost town if lava from Kilauea volcano crosses roads connecting the village with the rest of the Big Island . Hawaii County Civil Defense Director Darryl Oliveira talks to business owners at a meeting in Pahoa, Hawaii . But he said he's never experienced lava crossing a road so heavily relied on by residents and businesses. The part of Highway 130 that could be cut off is used by 7,000 to 11,000 vehicles per day, he said. The county is quickly trying to prepare alternate routes for people to use. But Hunt said these routes are some distance from Pahoa, and would take traffic away from the town and its historic main street. 'There's a lot of fears and anxiety and uncertainty about it all,' she said. Hunt, who is also running for county council, organized a meeting on Wednesday to help merchants and civil defense officials prepare for the lava's arrival. Those who live on the slopes of Kilauea volcano know lava could start creeping their way at any time but the area is still a powerful draw for many who value its community and affordability . Lava from Kilauea volcano is still at least a mile away from any homes in Kaohe Homesteads . Lava flow from the Kilauea volcano is approaching the boundary of the Kaohe Homesteads division on the Big Island of Hawaii. Hawaii has declared a state of emergency with lava  now less than 1.6 km from houses . A vent on the volcano began oozing lava on 27 June 2014, moving downhill at up to 240 meter per day . The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory said Wednesday the lava flow had advanced 460 yards since the previous morning. The flow emerged from a vent at Kilauea's Puu Oo crater in late June. Since then, it has traveled nearly 9 miles as the crow flies, or just over 10 miles if its twists and turns are accounted for. The lava is creeping through thick forest, setting alight trees and generating smoke plumes. It is visible only from the air, unlike previous flows that tourists could watch drop into the ocean from coastal viewing areas. The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory issued a warning to a rural community in the path of a lava flow on Hawaii's Big Island, as the molten rock moved to within a mile of homes . Observatory scientists said lava from the Kilauea volcano could reach the Kaohe Homesteads in five to seven days if it continues advancing through cracks in the earth . Lava from one of the world's most active volcanos has been advancing at a slower pace the past few days and is now moving parallel to a sparsely populated subdivision on Hawaii's Big Island .","Lava from a vent has come within a mile of the edge of the Ka'ohe Homesteads subdivision .

"Judge Mike Maggio posted details of actress Charlize Theron's adoption online has been barred for life . A judge who posted details of actress Charlize Theron's adoption online and complained about wives who wouldn't have sex has been barred for life . The state Supreme Court accepted the lifetime ban that was agreed to by Faulkner County Circuit Judge Mike Maggio and the Arkansas Judicial Discipline and Disability Commission. The disciplinary panel ruled last month that, using the pseudonym 'geauxjudge,' Maggio entered an online forum of Louisiana State University sports fans and shared details from Theron's 2012 adoption of a baby in the same court division where he served. Comments in January 2012 divulged details of Theron's adoption two months before she publicly released the information, while others talked about women in a derogatory way and another likened bestiality to sex in the transgender and gay communities. He said a 'judge friend' handled the case, before admitting that he was also involved in the case. When a poster asked if she had adopted a black child, he said that she had. Such proceedings are confidential in Arkansas, and there are no cases in the state's online court records that mention Theron's name. Her publicist, Amanda Silverman, declined to comment. In a June 2011 posting, 'geauxjudge' suggested that women who seek divorces after their husbands cheat may be better off financially by staying married. In Arkansas, circuit judges like Maggio handle divorce cases, among other civil and criminal casework. Revealed: He divulged that Charlize Theron had adopted a son two months before she announced it publicly in 2012. She is pictured in 2013 with the boy, Jackson, whom she adopted from South Africa . 'I see it everyday,' he wrote. 'A woman makes (an) emotional decision to divorce because the husband stepped out. When otherwise he was a good provider, father, and husband. 'Then a year or two later realizes uh oh I am worse off financially, emotionally and relationship wise but hey they showed that SOB. Too many times the women get their advice from other divorced women.' In another, Maggio, who has three sons and two daughters from a previous relationship and lives with his partner, Dawn, made derogatory comments about women, saying they needed to take care of a man's two basic needs for sex and food, adding: 'It takes two to pull the wagon'. Confidential: Postings on the website TigerDroppings.com show him discussing confidential information . Responding to a story about a woman who was arrested for allegedly having sex with a dog, 'geauxjudge' wrote that it was 'just a small step' from having 'TGGLBS' sex, an apparent reference to transgender, gay, lesbian or bisexual sex. And in 2012, he suggested that people can beat a drunken-driving charge by not cooperating with police and expressed a desire to obtain evidence photos from a case involving a cheerleader accused of sex with a minor. Concerning opnions: Maggio, who has five children, is pictured with his partner, Dawn, left and right . In a 2009 post about divorce, Maggio wrote he was tired of hearing complaints that husbands work all the time while a wife withholds sex and becomes unattractive and non-supportive. 'What did she think was going to happen....,' he wrote. Today the state Supreme Court e court rejected the panel's recommendation that he be suspended with pay until his term expires at the end of 2014, and instead ordered his immediate removal from the bench. 'We deem any further suspension with pay to be inappropriate,' the court said in its order. 'Therefore, we order the removal of Judge Maggio from judicial office, effective as the date of this opinion. 'By this order, Judge Maggio is henceforth prohibited from holding any judicial office in the state of Arkansas.' Maggio, who has been a judge since 2001, dropped his bid for a seat on the state Court of Appeals earlier this year after admitting to the posts. Justices also accepted the panel's decision to, in exchange for Maggio agreeing to step aside, drop its look at an Ethics Commission complaint that ended with Maggio paying a $750 fine to settle allegations he received improper campaign contributions. The disciplinary panel opened an investigation March 3 after the Blue Hog Report website noted a series of posts appeared to be coming from Maggio. Maggio subsequently tried to delete or edit some of the material. Maggio's attorney did not immediately return a call seeking comment Thursday.

"First Lady Michelle Obama will hit the campaign trail again next month, this time for Iowa Senate candidate Bruce Braley. The Des Moines Register confirmed Obama's plans with both the White House and the Braley campaign on Wednesday. Braley currently represents Iowa in the House of Representatives and is competing against Iowa state senator Joni Ernst for the open U.S. Senate seat in November's general election. The Democratic Rep. is currently leading his opponent by a razor-thin margin, and an endorsement from the first lady could give him the bump he needs to claim victory in November's election. Unlike her husband, whose approval ratings have reached new lows this summer, Michelle Obama continues to be well-liked by most Americans, making her an asset to Democrats chasing seats in the Senate. First lady Michelle Obama, left, is greeted by Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Michelle Nun, right, at a voter registration rally on Monday in Atlanta, Georgia . Nunn is competing for Georgia's open U.S. Senate seat against Republican David Perdue . 'The first lady is not only popular with Democrats, but with independents and Republicans as well,' Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Executive Director Guy Cecil told The Hill. 'She has been incredibly supportive of our campaigns and our work to hold the majority.' The first lady may be supportive of Democrats effort to retain the majority in the Senate, but she has been hesitant to lend her time to candidates. Democrats have complained in recent weeks that Michelle Obama, who had a 61 percent approval rating as of May, hasn't done as much as she could for the party ahead of November's mid-term elections. 'I don’t want to say she’s been M.I.A. but she’s been M.I.A.,' a Democrat in a tough race told The Hill in August. While Obama has appeared at numerous fundraisers for the the national Democratic Party she's been mostly unwilling to make appearances on behalf of individual Senate candidates, even as she has encouraged other members of the party 'to be even more passionate and more hungry' about getting Democrats elected to office than they were in 2010 and 2012. Unlike her husband, whose popularity has reached new lows this summer, Michelle Obama has been in high demand among Democrats chasing seats in the Senate . Michelle Obama had a 61 percent approval rating as of May. Her husband's popularity ratings have risen about 50 percent in months . Her only notable appearance on the campaign trail this fall came earlier this week when Obama headlined and fundraiser and rally on Monday in Atlanta, Georgia for Senate nominee Michelle Nunn. Nunn is the CEO of a non-profit organization called Points of Light. The daughter of former Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn, politics runs in her blood and she's currently seeking the state's open seat along with Republican nominee David Perdue. Perdue is a businessman who has served as the CEO or Rebook and Dollar General. Adding to the tangle of family ties in the race is that he's the cousin of Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue. Polling website Real Clear Politics has Perdue leading Nunn in the race by under two points. Michelle Obama came to Nunn's aid on Monday, stumping for her and other Georgia Democrats at a voter registration drive. 'The stakes this year couldn't be higher,' Obama told the throng of people who showed up at the event hoping to meet her. 'If we don't show up in the polls this November, if we don't elect leaders in Congress and here in Georgia who put people first instead of fighting for special interests, we know exactly what will happen,' she said, according to CNN. 'We will see more folks interfering in women's private decisions about our health care. We'll see more folks denying that climate change even exists. We'll see more votes against equal pay and immigration reform and raising"" the minimum wage.' Obama is pictured here holding two-month old Addison Bryant during Monday's voter registration rally . It's unclear when Obama will travel to Iowa other than sometime next month nor is it clear what sort of events she'll attend while she's there. It's likely she'll couple the campaign appearances for Braley with official White House business, as she did in Georgia on Monday when she visited the Booker T. Washington High School to promote her Reach Higher initiative, a program that pushes students to pursue careers in higher education.","Obama will stump for Iowa Senate candidate Bruce Braley next month .

"Oscar Pistorius’s former girlfriend has revealed her fears that he would kill her, and spoken of his 'angry and possessive rages'. Samantha Taylor, who dated the paralympian for 18-months, claims he made her sit on a naughty step as he shouted at her, and once drove his Porsche at 200mph as a 'punishment' for an argument. The 20-year-old student said she was once so scared that he would shoot her, she hid his gun. It was to be the same weapon he later used in the fatal shooting of his model girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp. Pistorius, 27, was cleared of the murder of Miss Steenkamp yesterday, but today faces jail for shooting her dead. Scroll down for video . Oscar Pistorius flies the flag for South Africa at the 2012 Olympic Games in London. At the time he was in a stormy relationship with Samantha Taylor, 20, who has now spoken of his 'angry and possessive rages'. Before . he got together with Miss Steenkamp, Pistorius had spent a . year-and-a-half dating Cape Town marketing student Miss Taylor. She told the Mirror she feared he would kill her and even once hid his gun. She said she was also left with . bruises and scars after she alleges he bit and pinched her. But Miss Taylor said it was not only physical violence that she suffered at the Blade Runner's hands - she claimed she was also tortured mentally by him. She said: 'Oscar used to lock me in his house and then go out. I had no food, I couldn’t get out. It was dangerous.' She alleges that he would often stay out all night after locking her in. Pistorius, 27, was cleared of the murder of Reeva Steenkamp (pictured) yesterday, but today faces jail for shooting her dead . Car fan: Miss Steenkamp revealed her love of Minis by posting this picture on her Facebook page . 'There for two tragedies but not the third': Reeva's parents June and Barry Steenkamp (above) said they nearly lost their daughter twice - once after nearly bleeding to death from tonsil surgery and then in a riding accident . She said he left her terrified after he drove his Porsche at up to 200mph to 'punish' her. One night, she claims, the athlete became so drunk that he set his floor on fire and danced around it. After slipping, she said he cut his lip and chipped his tooth - later convincing himself that she had hit him. It was then, she said, she became convinced he would shoot her. She told the paper: 'I had to hide his gun, I was so scared of him. 'But because he was so drunk he thought I’d beaten him up. He started screaming at me.' While he was with Miss Taylor, Pistorius was linked with numerous other women, including Russian model Anastassia Khozissova. When . it became clear that Pistorius and Steenkamp were dating, Miss Taylor . earlier said: 'Oscar has such a way with women. She’s probably not the only one . he’s got.' Miss Taylor went on to tell South Africa's City Press newspaper that 'Oscar is certainly not what people think he is.' 'I believe in destiny and faith': The 30-year-old had made an application to the Bar three years ago, but then received a call asking her to do an FHM shoot. She made the decision to take a career in modelling . Intelligent: Miss Steenkamp graduated with a law degree at the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University . Pistorius will find out today if he is guilty of the manslaughter of girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp during a Valentine's Day shooting at his home in Pretoria. The double-amputee broke down in court yesterday as he was cleared of two murder charges, but judge Thokozile Masipa hinted the 27-year-old may be convicted of a lesser charge of culpable homicide after describing his actions as 'negligent' on the night she died. The 27-year-old athlete broke down as judge Masipa said there was not enough evidence to support prosecution claims Pistorius intended to kill the law graduate-turned-model last year. But the judge appeared to indicate he will be convicted of culpable homicide - the South African equivalent of the UK's manslaughter charge - when he returns to court today, describing Pistorius as being ""negligent"" in killing 29-year-old Ms Steenkamp. She told the court in Pretoria, which included members of both the defendant's and the victim's families, that Pistorius acted 'hastily' with 'too much force' when he fired four bullets through his toilet door in the early hours of February 14 2013. Pistorius was also described by the judge as a 'very poor witness', who 'lost his composure' during cross-examination. At the age of five, Reeva nearly bled to death after suffering complications when she had her tonsils taken out . The athlete, dubbed Blade Runner due to his prosthetic limbs, has always admitted he shot Ms Steenkamp, though he told police he simply mistook his girlfriend for intruders. Delivering her verdict yesterday, judge Masipa criticised Pistorius' decision to reach for his 9mm pistol and fire it through the toilet cubicle in his home rather than raise the alarm or fire a warning shot. She said: 'If the accused, for example, had awoken in the middle of the night and in darkness seen a silhouette by his bed and in a panic shot at that figure, only to find it was the deceased, his conduct would have been understandable and perhaps excusable.' She added: 'The accused had reasonable time to think, reflect and conduct himself. 'I'm not persuaded that a reasonable person with the same disability would have fired the four shots.'The accused knew there was a person behind the toilet door, he chose to use a firearm. 'I am of the view the accused acted too hastily and used too much force. It is clear his conduct is negligent.'","Samantha Taylor dated paralympian for 18-months, before Reeva Steenkamp .

The two were in contact for almost 2 years before Wind drove from his apartment in Longmont, Colorado to where Burgos lives in Hartford, Connecticut on August 25, taking the girl from her home. She was last seen by her father playing in their backyard. Wind then drove the teen back to Colorado, taking her on a 'honeymoon-style trip' along the way according to NBC Connecticut, with stops in New York, New Jersey and Kansas. He even showed the young girl the spot where his parents fell in love . The teen was discovered at Wind's apartment yesterday, almost 2,000 miles from her home, over two weeks after she disappeared. Police said the teen was in safe and good condition. Terrified parents: No one had seen the teenager since she disappeared from her home on August 25 . Wind, who  was arrested  by Longmont police with the help of the FBI, is being charged with second-degree kidnapping, sexual assault of a child, Internet sexual exploitation of a child and enticement of a child. Officials are still uncertain if the young girl, who initially lied about her age and name when officials came to Wind's apartment, willingly went away him. The two reportedly slept together on an air mattress in Wind's apartment, and while the victim has denied they had sex, documents state, 'it is highly suspected unlawful sexual contact occurred based on totality of this initial investigation.' While searching a laptop following the disappearance, officials found pictures of male genitalia and a love poem they assume was written by the victim from July of 2013. Documents also reveal that one of the victim's friends said she had a boyfriend of over a year named 'Tim.' Wind's bond has been set at $100,000, and a judge has ordered that he have no contact with children.","Timothy Wind, 53, met Jillian Burgos, 14, almost two years ago on a Disney website .

"College lecturer Darren Tattersall, pictured, admitted having a schoolgirl fetish, a court heard . A college lecturer who taught students with profound learning disabilities has admitted having a schoolgirl fetish after being caught with hundreds of child abuse images. Darren Tattersall of Earby, Lancashire, watched around 50 indecent videos featuring Japanese schoolgirls and had saved up to 300 images, a court heard. The 33-year-old, who pleaded guilty to three charges of making indecent images of children while living in Darwen, Lancashire, had been working at Bury College, but was suspended as soon as the allegations came to light. School bosses say the offences were not connected to college activities. Preston Crown Court heard how Tattersall had admitted having an addiction to pornography, visiting explicit websites two or three times a week. He was handed a six-month prison sentence, which was suspended for two years, after admitting his crimes to police. The teacher, who has an eight-month-old baby, was also told he must attend an internet sexual offenders' treatment programme. He was also made the subject of a sexual offenders' prevention order for seven years when he appeared at the court. After the hearing, Det Sgt Mark Whelan, from the engage team at Lancashire Police said: 'He told us in interview he had a fetish for schoolgirls. 'If that is his fetish and he worked in a college, then that is not conducive to safeguarding the young adults he was exposed to. 'He was somebody who needed to be caught. 'We are not suggesting there has been any contact offences in this case. 'But these kind of offences are often the first step people take prior to doing something more serious. 'Therefore it is always a good use of police time to bring these people to justice.' Darren Tattersall had been working at Bury College (pictured), but was suspended as soon as the allegations came to light . Bury College principal Charlie Deane said: 'We have been reliably informed by the police that the offence is not connected to college activities. 'We immediately suspended the individual and carried out our own thorough internal investigation which confirmed this. 'The safeguarding of our learners is of paramount importance to us and we are confident that our policies and procedures are highly effective in safeguarding our students.' The seven year sexual offenders' prevention order prevents Tattersall working with children.","College lecturer Darren Tattersall admitted to having a schoolgirl fetish .

"The man suspected of shooting his daughter in the head before turning the gun on himself was 'not supposed to know where she and her mother lived', a neighbour said today. Residents in the quiet village of Northiam, East Sussex, said the gunman was involved in a custody dispute over the seven-year-old girl, named locally as Mary Ann, and that the father was thought not to know their address. But one neighbour who heard the gunshots yesterday afternoon said she had seen the gunman's silver Toyota Rav 4 driving around the village - home to Mary Ann and her mother, Lyndsey since last April - for the past week. The little girl, a pupil at Beckley Church of England Primary School, was today 'gravely, gravely ill' in Kings College Hospital, London, her mother at her bedside, as police confirmed they believed the shooting to have been a domestic incident. Scroll down for video . A schoolgirl  is 'gravely, gravely ill' in hospital after being shot in Northiam yesterday - locals said the gunman was her father and he then shot himself.  A blanket covering the man's body can be seen behind a car (circled) Villagers spoke of their shock at the horror in what is a leafy, quiet village near the border with Kent . This morning a police spokesman said the girl's condition was life-threatening and added 'We probably need to prepare ourselves for bad news'. Neighbours told how they heard the girl’s mother – who is separated from the father – scream 'He’s got a gun' before two shots rang out. Her father, who locals said fired at his daughter from inside his car, was pronounced dead at the scene in the village, with a single gunshot wound to the head. One said: ‘Apparently he was not supposed to know where Lyndsey and her daughter moved to.' Another said: 'They have only been in the village for a year and I’ve never seen a father around.  I’ve heard there may have been an ongoing custody dispute.' Neighbour Helen Barber, 38, who has lived in the road for six years, said: 'A neighbour phoned and said a little girl had been shot. 'I ran out up to the house where it happened and went in. Mary Ann was on the sofa. There was blood everywhere. 'I couldn't feel a pulse.'I've done first aid before and she was showing no signs of life. Lyndsey, her mum, was hysterical.' Locals said the little girl and her mother had moved to the quiet village of Northiam, near Rye, last April . Mrs Barber said the girl's mother has another child, a 21-year-old son who suffers from autism, and who was with a carer at the time of the shooting. Mrs Barber's husband, Stuart, 46, said he heard the gunshots but assumed it was someone shooting pheasants until he looked out of the window and saw a large silver Toyota with blacked out windows. He said: 'The car stopped.  There were two shots.  No-one went to the car. 'Within minutes armed police turned up and surrounded the car.' He added: 'The bomb squad were here last night as there were rumours he was in some sort of cult and wanted to take Mary Ann away.  I don't know his nationality.' Mrs Barber added: 'We have seen that car driving around for about a week.  You notice it. 'Maybe he was looking for her?' Other residents described the little girl as 'absolutely beautiful' and 'incredibly charming'. Cheryl Spicer, who lives nearby, said her partner was at their home when he heard screams of 'He’s got a gun'. A police spokesman said: 'At this stage we are not in a position to confirm the relationships of all those involved but we can say that the girl and the man knew each other' One villager said he had heard the man had gone to his former partner's home and shot the youngster . She said the girl, a pupil at Beckley Church of England Primary School, walked to school with her mother every day and that the pair had only lived in the neighbourhood for just over a year. She added: 'This sort of thing just does not happen around here. 'We can’t quite believe it.’ Anthony Burr, 37, who runs a public relations agency, said panic swept the neighbourhood when people realised somebody had shot a young girl. He added: ‘I was in the garden when I heard the shots and shortly after, my friend came over and told me that my children were locked in his house. ‘We thought at that point that a gunman was on the loose, so you can imagine the panic that swept the neighbourhood. Then I started to get reports that he had shot himself. ‘What appears to have transpired is that a father has gone to his ex’s house where his daughter lives and has shot her.' Today Cathy Cremin, headteacher at Beckley Church of England Primary School, said: 'We have received confirmation that the child who was shot is a pupil at our school. 'This is dreadfully sad and shocking and the whole school community will now be praying for Mary and her family.' Fear: A man who lives close to where the incident took place said the village was 'on lockdown' Writing on Twitter, Izzy Simmons said: '12 police cars, two undercover cars and two ambulances, just hope the little girl or her mum whoever has been shot is okay. The whole village has gone grey.' Another resident said his mother ran to the scene and lifted the girl into her house, laying her on the sofa before phoning 999. The girl was taken by helicopter to King’s College Hospital in London, where her mother is believed to be at her bedside. This morning a police cordon remained in place as neighbours spoke of their shock at the shooting in their quiet, close-knit community. Retired Eurotunnel worker Fred Lawrence, 75, said the girl, who he described as a 'lovely' youngster, would often stop to pet his cat. He said: 'I last saw the girl this week as she was going to school. She was always with her mum. Her mum was very timid, but a lovely lady and she would always talk. “The girl was obsessed by my cat and she would make a fuss before going on her merry way to school. I’m a bit upset talking about this. 'I just feel shocked. It’s bloody sad. A man, whether it was her father, he must have been in a hell of a state to do that.' Neighbours said the police took at least 15 minutes to get to the scene as it is ‘in the middle of nowhere’. Peaceful village: Cavix Field in Northiam, close to the scene of  yesterday's shooting . The upmarket village lies in a peaceful rural area 12 miles from Hastings on England’s south coast. A Sussex Police spokesman said: ‘One person suffered a gunshot wound and was taken to hospital for treatment. ‘The body of a man was found at the scene in Northiam. ‘His death is not being treated as suspicious.’ A man who lives close to where the incident, which took place between 6pm and 8pm, said the village was 'on lockdown' and armed police were 'everywhere'. The force said a suspect had been identified and 'is contained', and officers were not looking for anyone else . He added: 'There was a stand-off, the whole village was terrified. He then shot himself and we think he's dead. 'Both [the man and his daughter] have been taken away. 'This is leafy, rural Sussex - it's a nice area. Paul McCartney lives in the next village. This is not the kind of thing that goes on here.' Dru Riches-Magnier tweeted: 'I've heard several rumours and was walking my dog when people said they heard a shot near Cavix Field...doors locked.' Twitter user Izzy Simmons wrote that there were 12 police cars, two undercover cars and two ambulances at the scene. She added: 'Cannot believe this is all happening in Northiam AND in my old house!

'It really hasn’t set in yet,' the victim's mother, Judy Phillips, told WCCO after the capture. 'But I would imagine it would be some closure, not entirely because I don’t know if we’ll ever get over this. But we are awfully glad he is off the streets and that there’s no more harm done to anybody.' Hoffman had been the subject of several massive searches in the Minneapolis area in the weeks since, including two around the Anoka County airport in Blaine and one around the Mystic Lake Casino south of Shakopee. Cops said he may have been relying on social media to find shelter while on the run, . evading capture by using Craiglist and other dating apps such as Grindr . and Scruff.

Other features British parents rate as helping a child grow up happy include having friends who live nearby, areas safe enough for them to cycle and even a beach a short drive away. The Norfolk city, which is also famous for Stephen Fry and Lord Nelson, scored well on most counts - aside from a lack of hills suitable for sledging in the winter, due to its notoriously flat landscape. Lower down the list, cities like Birmingham, Bristol and Cardiff made the top ten. They were voted in thanks to the volume of parks and playgrounds within walking distance of homes. Coastal towns and cities like Newquay, Truro and Plymouth have the advantage of being nearer the seaside, earning them a place in the top 20. Apart from local amenities, other factors for a happy childhood are safety related, were policeman on patrol, good street lighting, neighbourhood watch schemes and lollipop ladies at crossings. Nina Uttley, brand manager for Panda Soft Drinks, said: 'A happy childhood does not depend on the latest games, expensive gadgets and access to theme parks. 'This survey shows just how vital the great outdoors can be.

"Ajaz Raja, 32, pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine with intent to supply and was jailed for two years and four months . A drug dealer has been jailed after police found his fingerprints on a Nando's napkin he had used to wrap cocaine. Ajaz Raja, 32, pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine with intent to supply and was jailed for two years and four months. Detectives found almost £7,000 of cocaine in a house in the Cheetham Hill area of Manchester - and Raja's fingerprints were discovered on a Nando's napkin he'd used to partially wrap some of the Class A drug. Manchester Crown Court heard that on 19 November last year, officers from North Manchester's Organised Crime Unit conducted a drugs warrant at a house on Lytton Avenue, Cheetham Hill. They found cocaine with a street value of £6,960, dozens of unused snap bags, and a set of digital scales. Raja's fingerprints were later found on a Nando's napkin he'd used to partially wrap a bag of cocaine in. PC Darren Wayman, of Greater Manchester Police said: 'No matter how well drug dealers think they cover their tracks they will always slip up, as in this case. 'Once we presented the prints evidence to him he has little option but to admit to the offence. 'He's now been jailed for more than two years so he won't be enjoying a meal out at Nando's, or anywhere else for that matter, for some time.'

"The San Francisco 49ers suspended veteran broadcaster Ted Robinson on Wednesday night for the next two games following comments this week on a San Francisco radio station about the Ray Rice domestic violence case that were deemed insensitive. The Pac-12 Networks also announced late Wednesday it had suspended Robinson for the next two weeks and that he would undergo sensitivity training. The 57-year-old Robinson spoke while co-hosting on KNBR radio on Monday and said Rice's now-wife, Janay, was partly to blame for not speaking up after he knocked her unconscious. 'That, to me, is the saddest part of it,' he said. Scroll down for video . Broadcaster Ted Robinson, center, and San Francisco 49ers' Vernon Davis, left, listen to Patrick Willis in this April 2012 photo. Robinson was suspended a few days after he said while hosting a radio program that Ray Rice's wife was partly to blame for not speaking up about the domestic violence . Besides the suspension, Robinson will also undergo sensitivity training. The issue of domestic violence is particularly sensitive for the 49ers, who recently had one of their players arrested on suspicion of domestic violence. Defensive tackle Ray McDonald has continued to practice and play since his August 31 arrest while celebrating his 30th birthday with friends and teammates at his home. CEO Jed York and coach Jim Harbaugh have said they will let 'due process' play out before making a decision about McDonald, while reiterating they have zero tolerance for domestic violence. In this February photo, from a still image taken from a hotel security video released by TMZ Sports, Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice drags his fiancee, Janay Palmer, out of an elevator moments after knocking her off her feet, against the elevator's railing at the Revel casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey . Rice holds hands with his wife as they arrive at Atlantic County Criminal Courthouse in Mays Landing, New Jersey . Robinson issued apologies through the 49ers and Pac-12 Networks. 'I want to unconditionally apologize for my comments the other day,' Robinson said. 'As a professional communicator, I am responsible for my words. My choice of words was careless and does not reflect my true feelings about domestic violence. I understand that the cycle of abuse keeps people in unhealthy relationships. No blame or responsibility should ever be placed on a victim.' In a statement, 49ers President Paraag Marathe said he told Robinson of the decision earlier on Wednesday. Rice was let go by the Ravens on Monday and suspended indefinitely by the NFL after a video was released that appears to show the running back striking his then-fiancee in February . 'The comments made by radio broadcaster Ted Robinson on Monday were offensive and in no way reflect the views of the San Francisco 49ers organization. We have made the decision to suspend him for the next two games. I informed Ted of our decision earlier today, and we will continue to address this matter with him internally. Our organization stands strongly against domestic violence and will not tolerate comments such as these.' Robinson, the 49ers' play-by-play voice since 2009, signed a five-year contract extension in May 2013 that takes him through the 2018 season. He will not call the team's home opener Sunday night against the Bears, the regular-season debut at new $1.2 billion Levi's Stadium. His first game back would be when San Francisco hosts Philadelphia on September 28. The Pac-12 Networks said Robinson wouldn't call games for two weeks. 'Ted's commentary on Monday was entirely unacceptable and stands in stark contrast to the core values of Pac-12 Networks,' Pac-12 Networks President Lydia Murphy-Stephans said. 'We value Ted as a member of our team, but see this as an important learning opportunity as we work with him through sensitivity training before welcoming him back to our air.'","The San Francisco 49ers suspended the veteran broadcaster for two games, while Pac-12 kicked him off air for two weeks .

"Most people will admit they have a dark side, but in the home of Star Wars super-fan Bill McBride, that side of the force is stronger than most. Sci-fi fan Bill McBride, 42, boasts the world's largest collection of Darth Vader memorabilia and is on a 20-year mission to turn his bedroom into a museum dedicated to the Sith Lord. Mr McBride, who has spent more than $284,000 on buying Darth Vader merchandise, has spent most of his adult lifeamassing a collection of more than 60,000 items including figurines, artwork and replica lightsabers. Star Wars obsessive Bill McBride has spent an estimated $284,000 for his 60,000 piece Darth Vader collection . Mr McBride has collected anything to do with his favourite character Darth Vader . Among the 60,000 pieces in his collection are these highly collectible Darth Vader figures, pictured . He has loved George Lucas' sci-fi movie series since he was five-years-old, but only began collecting Vader keepsakes in the 1980s. The Star Wars obsessive has dedicated an entire room in his Washington DC home to store his massive collection. 'The moment Darth Vader burst on screen in Star Wars, I was immediately a fan of the character,' he said. 'But when you have the imposing, powerful presence of David Prowse, the other-worldly voice of James Earl Jones, all wrapped up in one of the coolest, most amazing costumes in movie history, you can't help but fall in love.' Mr McBride said he once turned down the offer of a Porsche 911 from a man who wanted part of his collection . Mr McBride, pictured, has original movie props such as light sabers and Star Wars themed artwork. Mr McBRide has been building up his massive collection since he joined the British Army . Darth Vader was played in the original movie by British actor David Prowse, who was better known on UK TV screens as the Green Cross Code Man. Actor David Prowse, who played Darth Vader . He taught a generation of school children the correct method of crossing the road. Unfortunately for the actor, George Lucas did not like his broad regional accent and instead hired American actor James Earl Jones to voice the character. The classically trained stage actor had the perfect deep and menacing voice for Darth Vader. The hoarder, whose Darth collection contains everything from original movie props, pre-production items, original works of art and modern merchandise, said a 'market value' doesn't exist for some of his rarer items. And although some of his items could fetch for up to $16,500, he's reluctant to part ways with his cherished Vader relics. He said: 'I just had someone make one of the more interesting trade offers I've received over the years. 'A gentleman contacted me about trading for a select group of five or five items from my collection. 'Astonishingly, he offered the keys to his Porsche 911, but I turned him down, of course.' Despite his best efforts, Mr McBride says the collection will never be complete as he looks forward to the new saga in the Star Wars franchise, Episode 7. 'The hobby of Star Wars collecting is mind bogglingly vast, and it's easy to get lost. 'But if anything has changed over the decades, I am more passionate today than when I started. 'Needless to say, the entire world is now becoming fully engaged in Star Wars mania again and I for one am dying to head back into that galaxy, far far away.'

"Whether you're buying your first home or purchasing an investment property, the real estate market can be a difficult place to navigate. Prices are constantly on the rise, especially near Australian capital cities. Even purchasing land on its own can be a costly move. Daily Mail Australia spoke to property and real estate experts across the nation and asked them to pinpoint where they would purchase property if they were looking for their first home. They were given a budget of $400,000 and asked to pick a property in any suburb they saw fit as long as it was suitable for someone to move into almost immediately. Looking to  buy? Properties like this three-bedroom home between Brisbane and the Gold Coast offer first home buyer or investors fantastic value at around $400,000, real estate agents say . The experts also provided reasons they chose that particular home based on factors such as affordability, size, suburb, accessibility and of course location. The result is a list of properties in New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, South Australia and West Australia currently on the market that could be snapped up for no more than $400,000. NEW SOUTH WALES . Chris Gray, CEO of buyers agency Your Empire, chose a studio apartment just minutes from Sydney's bustling CBD as his pick for first home buyers in New South Wales. Located in Neutral Bay, just a 10 minute drive from the city centre, the property at 6/1 Spruson Street has spectacular harbour views but it also just a stone's throw from the action. 'This could be a great bachelor or bachelorette city pad for those that want amazing views as well as access to the heart of the action, whilst still being in a quiet location close to the city. It’s small but it’s a price almost everyone can afford,' Mr Gray told Daily Mail Australia. On the market for $320,000 and up, the open plan home came in well under the $400,000 budget. It also features a neat kitchen and bathroom. Chris Gray, CEO of Your Empire, picked this property in Neutral Bay for a first home buyer in Sydney .

He also pointed out the outdoor living area in the form of a balcony and the potential for renovations as other strong points of the apartment. One downside Mr Gray noted was the high strata fees due to its location. 'But as an emotional first home purchase, you’ll have plenty of fun there,' he added. Managing Director at SQM Research Louis Christopher recommended a different part of the state for those looking to purchase a property . Mr Christopher suggested suburbs such as St Marys in Sydney's west were a great place to purchase .

"MPs are pocketing even more expenses than they were before the 2009 scandal – with many putting family members on the payroll, figures showed yesterday. Taxpayers last year funded a record £103million of allowances. In 2008 – the year before the expenses scandal broke – the figure was £102million. Part of the increase is down to a rise in the number of MPs employing relatives and business associates on the public payroll. Some 168 parliamentarians – more than a quarter – listed wives, children and even parents on their expenses returns last year, costing taxpayers more than £4million. This is up 8 per cent on the 155 who did so the year before. Scroll down for video . The total bill for MPs' expenses is now more than it was during the 2009 scandal, figures published revealed today . Tory backbenchers Peter Bone and Christopher Chope both employ their wives on salaries of up to £50,000, the figures from the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority reveal. Critics say the perk – which five Cabinet ministers also take advantage of – allows politicians to increase their household income at the expense of the State. The figures also show that some MPs are paying their staff large bonuses, funded by the taxpayer. Conor Burns paid one aide a ‘reward and recognition’ payment of £2,000. Fellow Tory Mike Weatherley paid out a series of bonuses adding up to £1,950. Last night Andy Silvester of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘Taxpayers will be deeply concerned that the cost of Westminster is going up again. David Cameron specifically pledged to reduce the cost of politics after the excesses of the expenses scandal, and politicians must be held accountable for their promises. ‘Combined with the ever-increasing number of peers in the House of Lords, that promise looks increasingly difficult to keep. Justice secretary Chris Grayling employs his wife Susan (left) as an office manager on £35,000 - £40,000. Tory MP Conor Burns (right) paid one aide a ‘reward and recognition’ payment of £2,000 . Labour MPs Margaret Moran and Denis MacShane both lost their seats in Parliament after fiddling their expenses . ‘There’s nothing wrong with employing family members if they’re qualified for the job, but there needs to be total transparency whenever that’s the case.’ The bill for MPs’ expenses rose by 5 per cent last year, but IPSA says that once inflation is taken into account, the expenses total is lower than the pre-expenses scandal peak. The organisation added that it had saved more than £50million for the taxpayer since it was set up. The surge in family employment reflects a rule change that allows MPs to spend more on staff and, by using relatives, to top up their household income. In 2011/12, they were allowed to claim only £115,000 a year for staff. But that was increased in 2012/13 to £144,000 for London MPs to reflect higher costs in the capital. Other MPs claim up to £137,000. The public outcry over MPs employing family members began in 2008, when Tory MP Derek Conway was accused of paying his two sons for non-existent jobs. Calls for the rules to be changed intensified after the expenses scandal broke a year later. Last year’s £103million expenses total consists of £81million on staff, £11million on accommodation, travel and subsistence, and £11million on office costs. The biggest claim was by the DUP’s Jim Shannon, whose total spend was £229,262, including more than £38,215 on travel reflecting the cost of getting to and from his Strangford constituency, and £12,126 on hotels. IPSA chairman Sir Ian Kennedy said the system was saving money compared to the discredited regime that led to the expenses scandal. He said: ‘As part of our system of regulation, we have reduced the cost to the taxpayer by £58million. Such is the progress made since the scandals which came to light in 2009, our work is attracting the attention of parliaments around the world.’ Five Cabinet ministers – Patrick McLoughlin, Chris Grayling, Michael Fallon, Stephen Crabb and Francis Maude – have family members on the public payroll. A spokesman for IPSA said: ‘The two figures are not truly comparable, due to the impact of inflation. The £102million figure, uprated using the GDP deflators used by the Treasury for the Budget, produces a figure of £113million for this year.’","Almost 170 MPs employ their wives and children, documents reveal .

"A vagrant Santa impersonator given an Asbo for transforming a bus stop into a Christmas grotto was found dead of a drink and drugs overdose, an inquest has heard. Former jockey Gary Cooper was a well-known character in Penarth, South Wales, after putting up Christmas decorations inside the bus shelter, only for council workers to tear them down and ban him from the town. After he was given an Asbo in November 2012, the 52-year-old, dubbed 'Bad Santa' moved to Cardiff but on June 6 this year he suffered a massive heart attack following an all day drink and drugs binge, and died. 'Bad Santa': Gary Cooper, 52, who was given an Asbo for transforming a bus stop into a Christmas grotto was found dead of a drink and drugs overdose, an inquest has heard . Cardiff Coroner's Court heard how Mr Cooper, who called himself a 'Christmas kinda guy',  was found unconscious on the sofa at his home in the city by his girlfriend, Maria Magdalena Goodwin, 53. She told the court: 'I came into the room and he appeared to be dead,' she told the hearing. 'I tried to wake him by pulling on his ears and slapping him but he wouldn't respond.' Character: Mr Cooper was a well-known character in Penarth, South Wales, after putting up Christmas decorations inside the bus shelter, only for council workers to tear them down and ban him from the town . Mystery: Police investigating the death could not work out how he got his hands on the prescription drug methadone because his family said he did not have a known drug problem . An ambulance was called, and Mr Cooper was rushed to hospital where he was treated for cardiac arrest. Doctors at the University Hospital of Wales tried to resuscitate him but they were unable to save his life. A pathologist told the inquest how the former jockey was three times the legal drink drive limit and had a fatal level of the heroin substitute methadone in his system. Mugshot: Police issued this picture of Mr Cooper after he was given the Asbo in November 2012 . 'There was a toxic level of methadone exacerbated by the presence of other central nervous system suppressants,' said Dr Richard Attanoos. The inquest heard Mr Cooper had drank three litres of cider, a pint of white wine and two bottles of methadone. Police investigating the death could not work out how he got his hands on the prescription drug methadone because his family said he did not  have a known drug problem. Coroner Andrew Barkley recorded a verdict of drug related death. During his lifetime, Mr Cooper - who was born in Runcorn, Cheshire - had appeared in court 500 times, and been admitted to hospital on 170 occasions. Before becoming an alcoholic he had become an apprentice jockey and served at table at London's exclusive Dorchester hotel  as a silver service waiter. He had set up the grotto in Penarth for two years running, donning a Father Christmas outfit and spending £30 of his benefits money to deck out the bus shelter with a tree, tinsel and stocking. However, in November 2011 council workers pulled down the decorations following complaints from people living nearby, and the following year he was slapped with an ASBO to stop him doing it again. He branded council officials 'Scrooges' for banning him from celebrating the festive season in style, saying: 'I’m just a Christmas kind of guy. I’ve been homeless for the last few years and I just wanted it to be perfect. 'Everybody thought it was a great attraction but the council said they were going to take my stuff unless I took it down. Grotto: Mr Cooper had set up the grotto in Penarth for two years running, donning a Father Christmas outfit and spending £30 of his benefits money to deck out the bus shelter with a tree, tinsel and stocking . 'I think it’s ridiculous they’ve stopped me again, I’ve got no idea why I had to take my decorations down last year. 'They obviously have no festive spirit.' The ASBO restricted his behaviour in the run-up to Christmas in the Cardiff, Penarth and Barry areas of South Wales, and stopped him from having an open alcoholic container in any public area.","Gary Cooper had set up a bus stop grotto in Penarth, South Wales .

"There was a time when a cosmonaut returning to Earth would be feted as a national hero and showered with medals. These days, however, it seems the reward is something rather more modest... a watermelon. Russia's Oleg Artemyev was presented with the fruit yesterday after returning from a six-month posting aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Scroll down for video . Russian cosmonaut Oleg Artemyev clutching the watermelon he requested for his return to earth . The crew had reportedly developed a craving for apples and watermelons, which they hoped would help quench their thirst upon landing. By contrast Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space, was given numerous honours and treated to a huge reception in Red Square after touching down in 1961. The Russian Soyuz capsule that landed in Kazakhstan yesterday also contained US astronaut Steve Swanson and a second cosmonaut, Alexander Skvortsov. Riding inside a Russian Soyuz capsule, the three landed southeast of Dzhezkazgan, Kazakhstan at 0223 Wednesday GMT. Rob Navias, a NASA mission commentator, said it was a 'a pinpoint touchdown'. The men rode home in the same Soyuz capsule that carried them to the station in March. Mr Swanson said: 'We accomplished a lot. We've had a lot of fun.' In addition to a pair of Russian space walks, the returning crew tackled a record number of science experiments, upgraded the station's prototype humanoid robot and repaired broken equipment. 'We did a lot of maintenance, which is good and bad,' Mr Swanson said. 'I love doing maintenance, but it means things broke.' New station commander Max Suraev remains aboard the orbital outpost along with NASA astronaut Reid Wiseman and the European Space Agency's Alexander Gerst. Three new crew members, including the first Russian woman to serve on the station, are due to launch on September 25.

Mr Swanson, left, and Mr Skvortsov, right, speak with their families via satellite phones after landing . Mr Swanson is all smiles after being pulled from the capsule which brought him back earth . During their time aboard the space station, the crew participated in research focusing on Earth remote sensing, human behavior and performance, and studies of bone and muscle physiology. One of the key areas was also human health management for long duration space travel - NASA and Roscosmos are currently preparing for two crew members to spend an entire year aboard the ISS laboratory in 2015. During their time on ISS, the crew members orbited Earth more than 2,700 times, traveled more than 71.7million miles and welcomed five different cargo spacecraft. Mr Swanson also ventured outside for a spacewalk to replace a backup computer relay box that unexpectedly failed, while Mr Skvortsov and Mr Artemyev conducted two spacewalks totaling 12 hours and 34 minutes. Having completed his third space station mission, Mr Swanson now has spent a total of 196 days in space. Mr Skvortsov has accumulated 345 days in space on two flights, and Mr Artemyev accrued 169 days in space on what was his first mission. 'Getting three new faces up here will be lots of fun,' Mr Wiseman said in an in-flight interview. The newcomers are NASA astronaut Barry Wilmore and cosmonauts Alexander Samokutyaev and Elena Serova - who will become only the fourth Russian woman to fly in space and the first to serve on the ISS. The last Russian woman to fly in space was Yelena Kondakova, who was part of a NASA space shuttle crew in May 1997.","Two Russian cosmonauts and NASA astronaut touch down in Kazakhstan .

"Almost a fifth of us are so demanding we expect hourly contact from our other halves, a new study has revealed. And nearly a third of Brits (30 per cent) say they become 'very angry' if they get ignored by a friend or partner. But research released today indicates that more than half of people (53 per cent) are more upset and angry when ignored by a business. Nearly a third of Brits say they become 'very angry' if they get ignored by a friend or partner (file picture) The new study, carried out be Energy supplier E.ON, shows how we now value similar attributes in both business and personal relationships - with trust topping the list of qualities we look for. It found the most important attributes for maintaining strong relationships with friends and partners are are trust (71 per cent), loyalty (55 per cent) and humour (47 per cent). Meanwhile the attributes people see as most important when it comes to companies are trust (60 per cent), honesty (53 per cent) and loyalty (42 per cent). The study indicated how communication is a huge factor with both personal and business relationships. Almost a quarter (22 per cent) feel poor communication is the cause of previous relationship breakdowns. One in six Brits (16 per cent) even expect hourly contact from their other halves. And despite almost a third (29 per cent) frequently changing their romantic relationships, almost half (40 per cent) have stayed with their energy supplier for five years or more. More than half of people (53 per cent) are more upset and angry when ignored by a business (file picture) The study also showed the companies and businesses people feel strong ties to. When it comes to business relationships, water companies (2 per cent) are the organisations we are least likely to feel strong ties to. This is closely followed by councils (3 per cent) and energy providers (4 per cent). Supermarkets (18 per cent), banks (16 per cent) and sports teams (15 per cent) are the organisations we have the strongest relationships with. Dr Lynda Shaw, Psychologist and Relationship Expert, said: 'When forming any type of relationship, trust is crucial - whether it's with a romantic interest, hairdresser or an energy company. 'Trust stimulates the hormone oxytocin in the brain and this enhances trust. This wonderful feedback loop aids bonding and loyalty. 'It is however, also known to strengthen social memories which means that when we're let down by those in whom we've placed our trust, the effect is amplified. 'That's why it's so important to gain trust and keep it.' Fiona Stark, Corporate Affairs Director at E.ON, said: 'Our research shows that trust is the most important trait in both personal and business relationships. 'Distrust is the most frequent cause of relationships breaking down.'","Almost a fifth of Brits say they require hourly contact from their other halves .

"Twenty-eight preschoolers and two adults mistakenly drank bleach at snack time at a New Jersey day care center on Thursday and were taken to a hospital after some complained their stomachs were burning. The children, aged 3 and 4, and adult staff members of the Growing Tree Learning Center in downtown Jersey City were transported in five ambulances to the Jersey City Medical Center after a late-morning call to 911, Mark Rabson, a hospital spokesman, told Reuters. He said some complained of light-headedness, others of upset stomachs. By mid afternoon, all 30 were in stable condition and were being discharged, Rabson said. WABC reported a substitute at the facility offered the mixture. Scene: Authorities are seen with children and staff who accidentally drank bleach at the day care center . Danger: Twenty-eight preschoolers and two adults mistakenly drank bleach at snack time . The children and staff were reportedly having a morning snack of water and fruit when an adult noticed a faint bleach smell and reported it immediately . 'There was a poisoning and many children were injured,' he said, adding the children were walking on their own or were being carried out by their parents and 'have smiles on their faces.' Keith Kearney, executive director of United Cerebral Palsy of Hudson County, which runs the day care center that is open to all community members and serves 65 children from infants to age 4, told Reuters he had heard no reports of injuries and that the hospital visits were a precaution. 'We had an incident where one of the staff in the kitchen used the cleaning solution bottle to pour water for some of the children,' Kearney said. 'It was a repurposed plastic milk jug with a bleach water solution we use to wipe down surfaces. The label we had on the bottle wasn’t large enough to guard against it,' he said. The sick children and staff reportedly drank milk and water to recover . Tense: A young child is held as authorities look on .

The 911 call kicked off a mass casualty emergency response by the hospital, which called in extra doctors and nurses and worked closely with paramedics, police and fire units. They gave the victims liquids like water and milk to dilute the poison rather than inducing vomiting 'because it would burn on the way back up again,' Rabson said.

'Iran already stamps all over freedom of expression, banning the use of satellite dishes, filtering the internet, and jailing journalists, artists and film directors. The authorities should stop persecuting these people and drop this ludicrous case against them.' Scroll down for video . The young people were publicly shamed as their interrogation was aired on Iranian television along with clips of their video . Veiled: The three women from the video were seen veiled in the interrogation footage . The friends were arrested in May after police took offense at the video, which shows three men and three unveiled women dancing in the streets and on the rooftops of Tehran. A description for the video said: 'We have made this video as Pharrell Williams' fans in 8hrs, with iPhone 5S. 'Happy' was an excuse to be happy. We enjoyed every second of making it. Hope it puts a smile on your face.' Williams protested the arrests on Facebook, posting: 'It is beyond sad that these kids were arrested for trying to spread happiness.' The video titled 'Happy in Tehran' features the group dancing in various locales just as in the original and is one of hundreds of covers of the hit made by fans around the world. But after the video hit YouTube and racked up close to 200,000 views with the help of Western news sites like the Huffington Post, authorities hunted down its stars, interrogated them in footage seen across the country and threw them in jail, though they were later released on bail. 'After a vulgar clip which hurt public chastity was released in cyberspace, police decided to identify those involved in making that clip,' said Tehran police chief Hossein Sajedinia according to the ISNA news agency. 'After a vulgar clip which hurt public chastity was released in cyberspace, police decided to identify those involved in making that clip,' said Tehran police chief Hossein Sajedinia . Dismay: Pharrell expressed his sadness at the arrest of the young Iranians . The Grammy award winning singer weighed in on the controversy. 'It's beyond sad these kids were arrested for trying to spread happiness,' Pharrell tweeted, with a link to a New York Times blog story about the arrests. The arrests came despite the three men and three women trying to dial back their fame by setting their video to private when they realized it had angered Islamic authorities. 'Following a series of intelligence and police operations and after coordinating with the judiciary, all the suspects were identified and arrested,' said Sajedinia. Their interrogations showed the women veiled and angry officers asking questions. Sajedinia said they 'confessed to their criminal acts.' Islamic law stipulates that women must cover themselves in public. The video appears to show three women dancing exuberantly to the hit on Tehran rooftops, sans headress. The move came at a perplexing time since Iranian President Hassan Rouhani spoke publicly in support of loosening the state's cencorship of the internet. 'We ought to see (the Internet) as an opportunity. We must recognise our citizens' right to connect to the World Wide Web,' said Rouhani according to the official IRNA news agency. 'Why are we so shaky? Why have we cowered in a corner, grabbing onto a shield and a wooden sword, lest we take a bullet in this culture war?' he said in a speech earlier this year. He also posted a message that appears to offer support for the accused: 'Happiness is our people's right. We shouldn't be too hard on behaviours caused by joy.' In an interview with IranWire in April prior to the arrests, one of the women explained that the video was meant as a celebration of Iran and to show that young people there have fun like they do anywhere. 'Despite all the pressures and limitations,' she said, 'young people are joyful and want to make the situation better. They know how to have fun, like the rest of the world.'","Six young friends in Tehran are accused of 'hurting public chastity'

"The Great British boozer - for many beer-swilling Brits it's a treasured national institution. But, new research has claimed the humble pub may have been invented by, of all people, the French. According to drinks industry expert and author Ted Bruning, the first drinking houses to serve paying guests alcohol were set up by Norman conquerors just after 1066. Following William of Normandy's victory at the Battle of Hastings, the invaders set up watering holes for visiting French merchants. Zut alors! New research claims the Great British pub is in fact... French . According to drinks industry expert and author Ted Bruning pubs originated after the Norman conquest in 1066 when the invading French needed watering holes for their merchants . And worse still for those who cherish the more traditional British ideal, these were wine bars in the City of London - not the genteel country tavern we've become accustomed to. They would predate the first English-style 'alehouses' by around 150 years, said drinks industry expert and author Ted Bruning after spending 30 years trying to find Britain's oldest pubs. After the Norman invasion of 1066, a wave of French merchants travelled to and from London to buy and sell wares from the banks of the Thames. The wealthy merchants would arrive at The Vintry, the wharf full of wine warehouses in the City of London. So, traders based there decided to open up areas of the wharf to sell glasses of wine to the visiting merchants and the crews of the ships. And these, Mr Bruning claims in his new book Merrie England: The Medieval Roots of the Great British Pub, may well be the earliest known examples of pubs as we know them today. Mr Bruning claims in his new book that the first places to sell alcohol publicly were probably French wine bars . King William I 'The Conqueror' was the first Norman king of England. He is pictured here in a painting by an unknown artist, circa 1590 to 1610, shown at the National Portrait Gallery, London . Other theories have claimed pubs started in Roman times as roadside stalls serving wine to marching soldiers while beer became popular a lot later as a hygienic alternative to the disease ridden water system in Britain. While there are pubs around the country claiming to go back further because they are on sites which may once have served some kind of alcohol. But drinks experts continue to argue over what constitutes the first ever pub as we know them today said Mr Bruning, who used to write for the Campaign for Real Ale. Ted Bruning said: 'It can't be absolutely proved that the Great British Pub originated as a City wine bar where French speaking expats chose to hang out. 'But I can't find any trace of anything resembling a pub in Anglo-Saxon times, so by a process of elimination I can only conclude - however much I dread to say it - that the Normans invented the pub.' The first alehouse, which would have brewed and sold beer, appears to have arrived much later, in 1212, in south London are The Great Fire of Southwark. Ancient documents relate to new safety regulations for buildings in the area including some which mention premises making and selling beer.

"An elderly Melbourne workman is lucky to be alive after spending half an hour dangling upside down from a three-storey building. It's believed the 84-year-old was doing some maintenance work when he locked himself out and decided to climb over to another balcony, Seven News reported. But instead, he tripped and jammed his foot on the side railing of the balcony - which saved him from a 12 metre fall. Police officers held onto the man's legs until firefighters arrived and rescued him to safety. He was reportedly taken to hospital in a stable condition, suffering a sore ankle.

"Pupils would be grouped by ability in key subjects in every secondary school under the plans . Secondary schools would be required to teach pupils in sets according to ability under plans being considered by the Tories. They would be penalised for teaching mixed-ability groups for key subjects under controversial proposals to make sets effectively compulsory. The idea is being considered for inclusion in the 2015 Conservative Party manifesto. It would build on the policy blueprint in 2010, which pledged to ‘encourage setting so those who are struggling get extra help and the most able are stretched’. One report claimed Downing Street was pushing for the policy to be announced sooner and had even booked a venue for a launch. But Education Secretary Nicky Morgan insisted in the Commons there was ‘absolutely no truth’ in the ‘rumours’. She said political opponents had a ‘rather unhealthy interest sometimes in speculating about what I am or am not about to announce’. In an interview she added: 'It’s not something I am looking at.' Both Labour and the Tories have long supported setting but stopped short of making it compulsory. However last year the head of Ofsted called for greater use of sets from age 11 to ensure the brightest pupils reach their potential. Figures suggest the practice of separating children into ability groups does not become widespread until children are 14. Even among older children, not all schools use ability groups in core subjects. Ofsted’s Sir Michael Wilshaw said: 'I’d set from the word go (in secondary schools). 'Too many non-selective schools are failing to nurture scholastic excellence.’ Sources said the idea was ‘under discussion’ and part of the ‘policy debate at the moment’. While in opposition David Cameron called for a ‘grammar stream’ in every subject in all comprehensives. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan (left) denied claims the plans would be included in the 2015 Conservative Party manifesto. David Cameron (right) called for a 'grammar stream' in every subject in all comprehensives . He said: ‘I want to see setting in every single school. Parents know it works. Teachers know it works.’ It was claimed yesterday Mr Cameron’s advisers had drawn up plans for a compulsory setting policy. A source close to David Laws, the Lib Dem schools minister, said: ‘This has not been agreed with the Liberal Democrats and is not government policy. 'We don’t believe it would be appropriate to tie schools’ hands in this way.’ And Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: ‘This is an area for teachers to decide and for results to speak for themselves.’ Research published two years ago by the Royal Economic Society showed a higher proportion of ‘low-achieving pupils’ in each class had a ‘negative and significant effect on the academic achievements of regular pupils’ because they monopolised teachers’ attention. The announcement of the plans comes as teachers have been told to consider using seating plans to split up troublemakers and stop pupils choosing to sit with friends.","Plans may be included in 2015 Conservative Party manifesto, sources say .

Los Angeles County spokeswoman Lara Arsinian says the dog was bitten by the snake Wednesday in a residential area of Thousand Oaks. The dog's owner managed to take a photo of the snake, which animal control officers identified as an albino monocled cobra. The venomous albino cobra (pictured) was photographed by the owner of the dog it attacked . The dog was taken to an animal hospital in critical condition. Arsinian says albino monocled cobras are illegal to own. The snakes are common in southeast Asia and can grow to more than 4 feet long. Antivenom has been located at the San Diego Zoo, according to the LA Times. The owner of the snake has not been found.

"Nafees Hamid made sexual remarks to alleged victims and removed their clothes himself, a court heard . A respected neurosurgeon sexually assaulted ten of his female patients before falsifying their medical records to ‘cover his tracks’, a court heard yesterday. Nafees Hamid, 50, is accused of groping the women, aged between 22 and 66, during medical examinations, often while making lewd sexual remarks. Hamid was aroused while he made the ‘intimate examinations’, Birmingham Crown Court heard. A jury was told he would either ask the women to remove their clothes, or on some occasions remove them himself without warning. He would then touch them inappropriately and repeatedly, sometimes for prolonged periods and without wearing surgical gloves, the court heard. Some of the alleged victims were also complimented on their physical appearance and asked invasive questions about their sexual history. According to neurosurgeon Patrick Stratham, the doctor had no reason to carry out such medical examinations and most women were experiencing unrelated problems with their necks and spines. Hamid, who worked at Birmingham’s Queen Elizabeth Hospital and the city’s private Priory clinic for more than a decade, denies 14 counts of sexual assault between May 2009 and June last year. Jonas Hankin, QC, prosecuting, told the court: ‘Nafees Hamid was a consultant in neurosurgery who dealt with disorders affecting the skull, spine and nervous system. ‘It is the prosecution’s case that he performed unnecessary and medically unjustifiable intimate examinations on each of the ten women. ‘He ignored General Medical Council guidelines about intimate examinations and failed to record the examination’s findings in case records so as to cover his tracks. ‘His purpose in touching the private parts of these women was not medical but sexual. ‘In failing to observe the first rule of medicine, to do no harm, he betrayed the trust of his patients and his fellow professionals.’ He said that Hamid often ‘avoided having a chaperone’, which any patient can legally ask for during medical examinations. One patient, who was the first to report the alleged crimes last November, told officers that he had asked her to lie on a bed then, when she looked away, he undid the button and zip on her skirt. ‘The patient had been to see the surgeon with back and urinary problems,’ said Mr Hankin, who added that she told police Hamid had touched her intimately. The court heard she was ‘left frozen to the spot’ before he told her ‘you are a sweet girl’. The alleged victim then ran outside the hospital and ‘burst into tears’. Hamid is alleged to have sexually assaulted ten of his female patients while he was working at the Queen Elizabeth (pictured) and Priory hospitals in Birmingham . The ordeal left her feeling ashamed and embarrassed,’ Mr Hankin said. ‘An expert says these examinations should have been done by a specialist gynaecologist, not a neurosurgeon.’ The jury was told about another patient, a 42-year-old woman whom he saw on several occasions who had a neck injury and resulting urinary incontinence. Mr Hankin said: ‘He told her she had a “beautiful body”, asked her when she had orgasms, if she masturbated and then asked her to show him how. ‘The examination was entirely inappropriate as her problem was in the neck. ‘Eventually he told her he could no longer care for her as he had developed feelings for her.’ The alleged assaults at The Priory (pictured) and Queen Elizabeth hospitals are alleged to have taken place between May 2009 and June 2013 . The court heard Hamid, of Moseley, Birmingham, trained in Pakistan and moved to Britain in 2000. After the first patient reported him and a criminal investigation began, a letter was sent to all of Hamid’s female patients saying an unnamed doctor had been accused of misconduct. This is when his other victims came forward. Mr Hankin said: ‘He will argue that in some cases what he did was medically justified and that in others that allegations are incorrect, that the assaults never happened. ‘The fact that these women reported what had happened separately makes it legitimate and not the result of malicious intention.’ The trial continues.

"A heartless mum who abandoned her twin eight-month-old babies so she could get a job in Britain has been arrested by police in Romania. Mihaela Boghian, 32, left blue-eyed sisters Antonia and Iasmina in the corridor of a council apartment block in the city of Piatra Neamt in north-eastern Romania. She then went to an employment agency and signed up to work as a fruit picker in the UK. Little Antonia and Iasmina were the centre of a nationwide appeal after being abandoned in the corridor of an apartment block by their mother who had disappeared to the United Kingdom . While she waited for the paperwork to go through, the mother ignored a nationwide appeal for little girls' parents to come forward. The girls were only identified when their dad Marius Boghian, 35, spotted their faces on a television appeal and called police. Mr Boghian, who works on a building site in Germany and is estranged from his wife, said he had believed that his children were being well-looked after by their mother. Mihaela Boghian, left, signed up for work as a fruit picker in the UK, while her estranged husband and the girls' father Marius Boghian, right, was in Germany working on a building site . He added: 'I always watched the news in Romania online on my mobile phone, and I was shocked when I saw pictures of the two babies found in my hometown and then when I looked more closely I realised they were my daughters. 'At first I couldn't believe it but when I tried to reach my estranged wife and couldn't, I contacted police and they were able to then confirm that they were my girls. 'I'd thought my beautiful girls were safe with their mother.' The girls' father travelled to Romania where he was reunited with his daughters. The babies will stay with their dad under the supervision of social workers until an investigation has been completed. But Mrs Boghian now insists that she made a terrible mistake and has asked to be reunited with her young daughters. The babies were left in the corridor of a council apartment block in north-eastern Romania . Romanian police spokesman Alin Diaconescu said: 'She had been left to look after the children while her estranged husband was in Germany. 'But she was not satisfied with the amount of money he was sending back in child maintenance and felt trapped by having to look after the kids, so she had simply decided to abandon them. 'She managed to get into an apartment block and dumped them in a corridor on the sixth floor. 'They were found by a local resident in the apartment block who raised the alarm.' The twins' mother only contacted police after she realised their father had come forward. Speaking to local TV she said: 'I never meant to hurt them. We had no money and I wanted to go abroad to earn some. 'I thought a children's home could look after them better than I could, and I couldn't face all the questions so I just left them where it was warm and I was sure they would be quickly found. 'Now I realise what a huge mistake I made and I just want them back,' she added. But police say the children will remain with their father under supervision of social workers until they have completed an investigation into their abandonment. Mrs Boghian now insists that she made a terrible mistake and has asked to be reunited with her daughters . The babies' father said he thought his 'beautiful girls' were safe with their mother at home in Romania . A local resident indicates the corridor of the council apartment block where the little girls were found . 'She may be charged with child cruelty and lose her parental rights,' said a spokesman. Local Town Hall Child Care Director Cristina Pavaluta said: 'The mother says she wants the girls back. 'At the moment this is not possible. Not until the police investigation ends and we find out what actually happened, and are confident it won't happen again.'

"A majority of people in every country in Europe think Brussels should negotiate with Britain to keep it in the EU – except the French. Just four in 10 people in France think David Cameron’s demands for renegotiation should be met. More than half would rather see the UK ejected from the EU, according to a new European-wide poll. It is the first time EU citizens have been asked whether Brussels should accommodate British demands for reform. Scroll down for video . In each European country apart from France a majority think Britain's concerns should be accommodated . A majority in nine other European countries, including Germany, Poland and the Netherlands, all agreed that it would be better to negotiate with the UK than risk it walking away. Six in 10 Britons said the EU should take their concerns into account, with only 35 percent saying that the UK should leave instead. David Cameron has pledged to overhaul Britain’s relationship with Brussels before holding an in/out referendum on membership by 2017. But the Europe-wide polling suggests the French will be the biggest roadblock to Mr Cameron’s demands for reform. The polling was undertaken by think tank The German Marshall Fund of the United States, as part of a wide-ranging annual report on global opinions to major issues. The Dutch were almost evenly split on the question, with just 45 percent saying Britain should be able to renegotiate, but fewer, 40 percent, thought that a UK exit was preferable. French President Francois Hollande will be David Cameron's biggest road block to reform of the EU a poll of his countrymen suggests . Earlier this year, former French Prime Minister Michel Rocard, who served under François Mitterand, called for Britain to leave the Union saying that Britain was the cause of all of the EU’s problems. He said: ‘Britain is a great country that has always refused to allow Europe to interfere in its affairs. It has blocked any further integration. ‘If they go, it becomes possible to respond to the needs of governing in Europe. Even Germany realises this and demands it. I hope for it a lot because they have prevented it from developing, they killed it.’ The French government has previously made it clear that it is in favour of Britain staying within the EU – but not at any cost. Speaking in early 2013, the French foreign minister Laurent Fabius told JDD: ‘If you give in to the demands of the British Conservatives, the ball of wool will unravel, Europe will fray. ‘We will not resolve our problems by having a self-service or à la carte Europe. On the contrary.’ The GMF poll also asked whether people thought membership of the EU had been good for their country. The Germans were most supportive of EU membership, with 76 per cent believing it to be good, against just 21 percent who did not agree. Britons were the most sceptical, but a majority in the UK still thought that on balance membership was a good thing. Just over half thought that membership had been beneficial, against 40 percent who thought that it had not. None of the countries surveyed showed a majority for people believing that EU membership had not been beneficial.","Just 40% of French think the PM's demands for renegotiation should be met .

The police said that all seven attackers, pictured running from the platform, were caught shortly afterwards . The attackers surrounded the brothers as they sat waiting on a bench and asked them to flash gang signs. When the pair refused, saying they were not in a gang, one of the attackers pulled out a machete and struck the 26-year-old in the head. Mario Elvira, 18, hacked the victim's head and neck as the rest of the group surrounded the bench. Footage taken from a platform security camera showed that the assault continued until the next train pulled into the platform - causing the attackers to flee. The 26-year-old victim was taken to Swedish Covenant Hospital where he remains in a stable condition. He suffered a deep gash to the head, which required 30 stitches.

"This is the amazing moment lumps of solid rock explode into the air as the earth sheds its outer layer in a strange geological phenomenon known as exfoliation. The incident is one of a number of exfoliation events to have taken place in the last month in the Sierra Nevada range, eastern California,  damaging a nearby dam. A local resident captured the moment and uploaded the strange event to YouTube where it has been viewed more than 615,000 times. Scroll down for video . The solid granite rock can be seen moving as it is heated by the hot Californian sun . Witnesses can see cracks developing while all around them there are popping sounds as the rock moves . Exfoliation occurs in areas with 'igneous' rocks such as granite. The deep rock is under extremely high pressure, but as the surface layers are worn away due to normal erosion, the pressure is reduced. If the rock is heated by strong sun light it will expand and then contract at night time. This mechanical process weakens the rock where it eventually cracks and even explodes in a spectacular fashion. According to the Twain Harte Lake Association the area suffered 'three natural rock stress release events' in August. A statement from the association said: 'These events resulted in fracturing of the existing granite rock dome that forms the left dam abutment. Fractures appear to be sheeting/exfoliation joints (similar to that of an onion layer peeling), relatively thin (approx. 1‐3 feet in thickness).' As a result of the cracking, the nearby dam suffered a leak of about 40 gallons per minute which prompted safety officials to drain the lake while a survey could take place. Leanne Hughes, survey geologist with the British Geological Survey said the issue of exfoliating rock is not tremendously rare. She said: 'It is unusual to see exfoliating rock captured on video but it is not very rare. It is caused when igneous rock such as granite is exposed to strong sunlight and dry conditions. Under the intense infra red rays the rock expands and then it contracts at night. 'This mechanical process weakens the rock until it reaches the point where it fails. This can happen in the UK but it is not very dangerous.' Eventually a small puff of smoke warns that the rock is approaching its breaking point . Then suddenly, large chunks of rock explode throwing dozens of fragments are thrown into the air .","Scientists forced to drain a lake as the exploding rock threatened a dam .

"Feline owners should 'cat-ify' their homes with the same child-proofing techniques used by parents, according to feline behaviorist Jackson Galaxy. Mr Galaxy, the host of Animal Planet's My Cat from Hell, appeared on the Today show, where he advised Lindsay Custozzo, a Pittsburgh woman with a feisty feline, to store small objects in a kitty-proof cabinet. 'You have kids, you childproof. Whether it's change, earrings, hair ties - they go in something, and that something has a child lock on it,' he said. Kitty-proof: My Cat from Hell host Jackson Galaxy said that small items such as hair ties should be stored in a cabinet with a child lock . Ms Custozzo was also frustrated with her cat Lucy, a two-year-old Siberian mix, for leaving paw prints on her kitchen table. Mr Galaxy told her to 'stop providing temptation' by leaving clutter on the table top. 'If there's nothing for them to get up there and get, they'll stop getting up there,' he said. Off the table: Mr Galaxy said that cats will be less tempted to climb on furniture if owners clear the surfaces of clutter . Blinds ambition: He also recommends giving cats an outside view when owners leave the house . When Ms Custozzo complained that Lucy was climbing on her window blinds, Mr Galaxy said that it's important for owners to raise the blinds when leaving the house so that curious cats won't be drawn to them. 'We have to allow her to see what you are doing,' he said. And for those fed-up felines who act standoffish, Mr Galaxy had a simple solution: more playtime with toys. Playtime: Mr Galaxy said that engaging cats with toys is a good way to cope with standoffish behavior . Ask an expert: Mr Galaxy (left) teaches Ms Custozzo (right) how to 'cat-ify' her home . 'She's just in that world of being a teenager,' he said. 'All we have to do is direct all those behaviors in a positive place.' My Cat from Hell, which premiered in 2011, sees Mr Galaxy providing guidance to the owners of cats with behavioral problems. He also runs a private consulting practice in Los Angeles.",Cat behaviorist Jackson Galaxy recommends using child-proof locks to keep curious felines from snatching small objects .
"Sir Mark Thatcher will be among the dignitaries at the inauguration of a square in Madrid next week named after his mother, Margaret. The businessman, chief mourner at his mum’s funeral last April, has confirmed he will attend the official opening ceremony on Monday. Madrid mayor Ana Botella proposed naming a street or square in the Spanish capital after the Iron Lady just a day after she died from a stroke aged 87 at London’s Ritz Hotel. Sir Mark Thatcher will be among the dignitaries at the inauguration of a square in Madrid next week named after his mother, Margaret . The move was criticised by opposition politicians, with the city’s Socialist leader at the time claiming Thatcher was a 'pioneer of a good part of that which had caused most inequality and injustice in Europe'. Margaret Square Square - Plaza de Margaret Thatcher in Spanish - will be a small square off Madrid’s emblematic Colon Square in the city centre near to the National Library and Hard Rock Cafe. It is currently unnamed. It is not known if Sir Mark’s twin Carol will attend the event. Simon Manley, British Ambassador to Spain, has accepted an invitation. Last September former Tory PM John Major unveiled a street named after him in Cancelada, two hours' drive west of Madrid. Mr Major has holidayed in the small village for the last 25 years and stays at a country house owned by friend and former Conservative Party colleague Tristan Garel-Jones. Mr Garel-Jones, minister of Europe under John Major, translated his acceptance speech into Spanish for him at the unveiling ceremony after the former PM admitted he was an 'idle, lazy linguist' and only could say ‘gracias’. Margaret Square Square - Plaza de Margaret Thatcher in Spanish - will be the second Spanish square named after a former Conservative Prime Minister .","Sir Mark Thatcher will be among dignitaries at naming of Madrid square .

NASA's Orion spacecraft, preparing for its first flight, is rolled out on Thursday in Cape Canaveral, Florida . An unmanned version of the  Orion capsule,which has been under construction for three years, is due to launch aboard a rocket on December 4 from nearby Cape Canaveral Air Force Station . 'This . marks the end of the assembly process for the spacecraft.' United Launch Alliance is jointly owned by Lockheed Martin . Corp and Boeing Co. In December, Orion will be flown to an altitude of about . 3,600 miles from Earth, 14 times farther away than . the International Space Station. The capsule will then careen back toward the planet, . slamming into the atmosphere at 20,000 mph. At that . speed, Orion's thermal protection system should heat up to about . 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit, proving the . shield can protect astronauts returning from the moon and other . deep-space destinations.

Orion is being prepared for its first launch later this year, an uncrewed flight that will take it 3,600 miles above Earth, in a 4.5 hour mission to test the systems critical for future human missions to deep space. After two orbits, Orion will reenter Earth’s atmosphere at almost 20,000 miles per hour before its parachute system deploys to slow the spacecraft for a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean. Eventually, the U.S. space agency wants to fly a . four-member crew to Mars. NASA has been out of the human space launch business since . the shuttle program ended in 2011.

The contenders are privately owned Space Exploration . Technologies, also known as SpaceX, privately owned Sierra . Nevada Corp and Boeing. Work on the Orion deep-space capsule, built by Lockheed .

Orion is part of NASA's follow-up program to the now-retiredspace shuttles that will allow astronauts to travel beyond theInternational Space Station, which flies about 260 miles above Earth . In June, the test version of Orion touched down safely in the Arizona desert after being pulled out of a C-17 aircraft, 35,000 feet above the U.S. Army's Yuma Proving Ground. It was the first time some parachutes in the system had been tested at such a high altitude. Engineers also put additional stresses on the parachutes by allowing the test version of Orion to free fall for 10 seconds, which increased the vehicle's speed and aerodynamic pressure. After Orion's free fall, its forward bay cover parachutes deployed, pulling away the spacecraft's forward bay cover, which is critical to the rest of the system performing as needed. The parachutes that slow Orion to a safe landing speed are located under the cover, so the cover must be jettisoned before they can be unfurled. The test also marked the last time the entire parachute sequence will be tested before Orion launches into space in December on its first space flight test, EFT-1. During the flight, an uncrewed Orion will travel 3,600 miles into space, farther than any spacecraft built to carry humans has been in more than 40 years.

"Overall acceptance of gays and lesbians in American religious congregations rose significantly between 2006 and 2012, but it declined in Catholic congregations, according to a new survey. Duke University's National Congregations Study, derived from interviews with representatives of 1,331 American congregations, was released Thursday. The study found overall acceptance of gay and lesbian members increased from 37 per cent to 48 per cent over the six-year period. Religious congregations around the world are becoming increasingly welcoming to gays and lesbians. In Auckland, New Zealand, Natasha Vitali, left, and Melissa Ray exchange rings with marriage celebrant Rev Matt Tittle . The New York City Gay Men's Chorus performs during the PFLAG National Memorial for founder Jeanne Manford at The Church of the Village in April 2013. A new survey shows most congregations in the U.S., though not Catholic ones, are becoming more accepting of homosexual members . 'The increasing acceptance of gays and lesbians is a well-known trend in America,' said Mark Chaves, a Duke professor of sociology, religious studies, and divinity, who  directs the study. 'Churches are no exception.' But for Catholic churches, the number of congregations that accepted gays and lesbians as members dropped to 53 per cent from 74 per cent.. Chaves suggested this may be due in part to fallout from the child sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic church, which some associate with homosexuality. Dayne Law, right, and several others wave flags and cheer outside the Utah Pride Center after the 10th Circuit Court in Denver ruled and upheld same sex marriage in Utah in June . Acceptance of gays and lesbians as volunteer leaders increased from 18 per cent to 26 per cent overall but decreased in Catholic churches from 39 per cent to 26 per cent. Growth was especially strong among black Protestant churches, white liberal Protestant churches and non-Christian congregations. White conservative Protestant churches were more accepting of gay and lesbian members but not volunteer leaders. 'Congregations reflect general cultural trends, but they also reflect divisions on this issue,' Chaves said.","Acceptance of gay and lesbian members rose to 48 per cent in 2012 from 37 per cent in 2006, according to the Duke University survey .

"It is the fast food chain famous for its Happy Meals and 'I'm lovin' it' slogan. But a disabled pensioner was left furious when he was fined £200 for falling asleep in a McDonald's car park, after buying a Happy Meal. John Colliver, 71, from Caerphilly, who used to think of himself as McDonald’s most loyal customer, has now switched allegiance to rivals Burger King. Scroll down for video . Not lovin' it: Pensioner John Colliver, 71, was fined £200 for falling asleep at the McDonald's car park in Blackwood, South Wales (pictured) after buying an early morning Happy Meal . Mr Colliver, who runs an animal sanctuary from his small farm, dozed off in his car after treating himself to a 5am Happy Meal at the McDonald's in Blackwood, South Wales on April 4. But he later received a £100 fined for overstaying the 90 minute maximum free parking. The furious pensioner - who would visit McDonalds six times a week - refused to pay and the fine was doubled with McDonald's citing 'court costs'. Mr Colliver, who has diabetes, said: 'I bought a Happy Meal – a burger, chips and white coffee – and after eating it, I sat in my car listening to Classic FM and dozed off. 'I often get up early when I’ve got a lot of work on and would have an early meal because it’s good value and sets me up for the rest of the day. 'I thought I had just dropped off for a minute, I do that in the car when it’s hot. It’s not until the fine dropped on my mat at home that I even knew about it.' He added: 'I’d been working long days at the sanctuary and when I get in the warm after eating I can fall asleep. 'But this feels like victimisation. I was probably the most loyal customer McDonald’s ever had. I used to eat there five or six time a week, spend up to £50, and sometimes call in twice a day. Snubbed: Mr Colliver, formerly a loyal McDonald's customer, was given the fine for falling asleep in a car park . The 71-year-old said he was now boycotting McDonald's because of his treatment. 'I eat at the town’s Burger King now,' he said. 'Wanting me to pay £200 for a Happy Meal, that’s got to be the most expensive burger and chips in the world. 'I’m a pensioner, I can’t afford that sort of money. I used McDonald’s because it was cheap and I like the food. If I did pay it I couldn’t go back there, I’d choke on my chips. It is unclear whether he is still liable to pay the extra £100 court costs added to the amount. In response, a spokesman for McDonald’s said Mr Colliver had failed to respond to earlier notifications or make a formal appeal within the time necessary. However, the firm said it had since cleared his fine. It is unclear whether he is still liable to pay the extra £100 court costs added to the amount. A spokesman for the company said: 'In instances where a customer feels that a Parking Charge Notice has been issued in error, we ask that they follow the procedure outlined by the ticket issuer to make an appeal. 'It is with regret that in this case the customer did not appeal the charge notice and did not respond on the several occasions he was sent notifications by the ticket issuer on this matter. 'We were therefore unaware of his case until court action had been taken. “The fine has since been cleared and we have informed the customer that should the situation arise again he must contact the ticket issuer to appeal it.'

"A conman known as 'Moneybags' has had his 1922 Rolls-Royce seized by police as they attempt to recover the $17 million he stole from the New Zealand government. New Zealand fraudster Michael Swann's Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost is expected to earn between $60,000 and $80,000 at auction in Auckland this week. The sale comes after the IT man previously had his other assets, including dozens of luxury cars, vintage motorbikes, speed boats, houses and even an old fire engine auctioned off in 2013. Michael Swann's Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost was discovered in a shipping container . The vintage car was discovered in a container at Port Otago's Dunedin container yard last year, according to the Otago Daily Times. Police said Swann paid $160,000 to a man in Christchurch in 2004 for the car. 'It is an English built car and comes with copies of original build, ownership and service records,' Turners Car Auctions said. The vintage car was made in 1922 and is expected to earn $60,000-$80,000 at auction . Michael Swann (left) was jailed in 2009 for a $16.9 million fraud against a health board. Mr Swann's house (right) at 14 and 24 Ferntree Dr, Wakari, Dunedin, was bought for $644,000 and sold for $585,000 at auction in 2013 . It was reportedly built in 1922 but rebodied in 1934 in Buckinghamshire, England. Mr Swann was released from jail a year ago after he was convicted of defrauding Otago District Health Board of nearly $17 million. He was jailed in 2009 after he stole millions of dollars of public money while working for the DHB as the Chief Information Officer. One of Mr Swann's many vintage cars that were seized: A Jaguar E-Type V-12, bought for $75,000 and sold for $53,000 . His collection boasted this 1969 Mercedes-Benz 280SL bought for $65,000 and sold for $58,000 . He owned a 1990 Porsche 928, bought for $24,000 and sold for $13,000 . He made up dodgy invoices and charged the government $16.9 million for IT-related services that were never provided. During his serious spending spree, he claimed he had hit the jackpot with a software programme bought up by computing giant Microsoft. He reportedly spent the proceeds of his crime on a holiday house in Wanaka, a collection of luxury cars such as a Lamborghini and six boats. Mr Swann had more than one Rolls-Royce. He also owned this 1938 Phantom III, bought for $200,000, and sold for $97,100 . And his taste for vintage vehicles even extended to a 1911 Cadillac 30 Saloon, bought for $54,000 and sold for $56,000 . He claimed to own 20 4x4 vehicles, including this Toyota Landcruiser (left). He also had a 1942 Willys Jeep (right) bought for $10,000 and sold for $13,000. This Land-Rover 64/65 was bought for $17,800 and sold for $15,200 . During his High Court trial, former colleagues told how he would drive to work in his Lamborghini. Swann earned a $145,000 salary, which he gave to his then wife Anna Devereux, but scooped on average $43,000 a week from his fake contracts. He told the court he had 19 cars and more than 20 4x4 vehicles. The IT specialist owned his very own ship, the 'Townsend Cromwell'. Bought $826,000 and sold for $650,000 . This Rinker Captiva 282 boat and trailer, bought for $96,239 and sold for $44,500, was seized . One of three inflatable boats which he paid $109,867 for was sold for $35,800 . Mr Swann even owned a random Isuzu fire engine bought for $40,000 and sold for $9000 . An auction in November last year saw his his historic home in Dunedin sold for $585,000, his Wanaka holiday home sold for $482,000, a large white ship sold for $650,000 and a 1924 BSA motorbike sold for $13,000. A cream Jaguar E-Type V-12, bought for $75,000, was auctioned of for $53,000 and a 1969 Mercedes-Benz 280SL bought $65,000, was sold for $58,000. Any proceeds of the sales of his many assets are being returned to the government. He owned a holiday home in Wanaka which he bought for $700,414 but it was sold for $482,000 .

"David Gauke, financial secretary to the Treasury backed the plan claiming HMRC needed the threat of criminal prosecution to stop  tax evasion . People who fail to declare money held in offshore accounts could face prison under controversial plans to add to the taxman’s growing armoury of powers. HM Revenue & Customs has already faced anger over its request to be able to raid bank accounts for unpaid taxes without obtaining a court order first. Yesterday it launched a fresh power grab, setting out plans for a new criminal offence of failing to declare income from money held in offshore accounts. Anyone found to have withheld details of their funds could face ‘unlimited’ financial penalties, or up to six months in prison in the most serious cases. HMRC’s demand for greater muscle comes amid a broader crackdown on tax evasion, as Chancellor George Osborne looks to balance the country’s books. Some £1.5billion has already been recovered from offshore tax evaders over the past two years, HMRC said. But the proposals would further beef up HMRC’s power by absolving it of the obligation to prove that someone has deliberately tried to avoid paying their share. Instead, the onus would be on taxpayers to ensure that they are declaring funds stashed in foreign accounts. Ignorance of the law or of one’s own financial affairs would no longer be deemed an acceptable excuse. HMRC said that under its proposals, offshore evasion would become a ‘strict liability’ offence meaning a court no longer has to consider the state of mind of a defendant before convicting. This category of offence is usually reserved for crimes that pose a direct risk to the public, such as speeding or selling contaminated food. ‘It’s hard to see how non-declaration of tax fits into this category,’ said Gary Ashford, of the Chartered Institute of Taxation, who described the plan as hugely controversial. He added: ‘The Government must recognise that while some taxpayers actively seek to hide their income by failing to declare their accounts to HMRC, there will be individuals who make mistakes in their financial affairs without intending to act wrongly. Not everyone who under-declares their tax is acting with criminal intent.’ HMRC, pictured, said they would only prosecute those evading 'significant' amounts of tax under new plans . HMRC insisted that criminal prosecution would hit only those who are evading ‘significant’ amounts of tax, although it has yet to determine the threshold. But critics warned that frail and vulnerable people could find themselves at risk of prosecution through no fault of their own. Stephen Camm, tax partner at accountants PricewaterhouseCoopers, said HMRC’s past record of major blunders meant it was not suited to wielding such extensive powers. HMRC said its proposals would be directed only at ‘highly sophisticated’ schemes operated by ‘stone cold tax cheats’. And David Gauke, financial secretary to the Treasury, said HMRC needed the threat of criminal prosecution to stop the ‘blight’ of tax evasion. Some richer taxpayers in Britain have turned to offshore bank accounts in an attempt to shelter their income from the taxman. They have stashed money outside their country of residence because they mistakenly thought it could not be touched by UK authorities. Not all offshore accounts are used for tax avoidance, however, and the practice is not in itself illegal. Many people set up offshore accounts to look after income from an overseas property. The problems arise when this cash, property or other asset is not declared to HMRC where it is liable for tax.","HMRC wants new powers to find 'undeclared' income in off-shore accounts .

"Paul Swann has been jailed for 12 weeks for fraud after pretending he had cancer and was raising money for a local hospice . A conman who pocketed thousands of pounds worth of donations for a hospice after pretending he was dying of cancer has been jailed. Paul Swann even told his family and friends he was terminally ill in a bid to swindle them out of money. He organised a 'charity event' which he said was for St Catherine's Hospice in his home city of Preston, Lancashire to get more cash. The 46-year-old was jailed for 12 weeks this week after magistrates heard he 'abused the generosity of unsuspecting strangers for his own selfish gain'. The fraudster made £500 from those he invited to his 'hospice charity night' and a further £2,000 from the Professional Footballers' Association after they heard about his supposed plight, Preston Magistrates Court heard. Prosecutor Elliott Taylforth said: 'Paul Swann cruelly deceived his family and friends by fabricating a fake terminal illness. 'Once he had gained their sympathy, his deceit escalated as he organised a fundraising event at a local social club, pulling on the heart strings of members of the public to donate their hard-earned money to the cause. 'He pocketed the money plus took a large donation from a charity for his own selfish gain. The offences Swann committed are far from victimless crimes.' Stephen Greenhalgh, chief executive of the hospice whose name was used by Swann, said: 'St Catherine's Hospice has been left shocked and saddened by the actions of Paul Swann, who has defrauded local people of important funds which were so generously given. 'As a charity and organisation supporting people who are facing the true reality of life with serious illness, we find the manner of his deception particularly heartless. 'In the current economic climate, the charity is finding it very difficult to raise money to fund our specialised care and support for patients and their loved ones at the time they need it most. 'Unfortunately, situations like this affect public confidence and can make fundraising even harder. 'We do all that we can to prevent fraudulent activity, which is why we brought this matter to the attention of the police. Fortunately situations like this are few and far between.' Swann admitted two offences of fraud by false representation, which took place between January and June this year and March and June this year.

"Frittered away: Dennis Harold, 60, spent six years stealing from London recruitment firm Devonshire . A City worker stole almost £3million from his employer then frittered it away on gambling, chauffeur-driven cars and a Thai bride. Dennis Harold, 60, spent six years inventing fake companies and temporary staff to transfer funds from London recruitment firm Devonshire Appointments, where he was a payroll administrator. Today the father-of-four was jailed for four years - along with a colleague who discovered the scam but took £1million to keep quiet. The Old Bailey heard Harold, a trusted employee of 14 years, squirreled away £2.9million through more than 20 invented bank accounts between 2007 and 2013. He then squandered an estimated £1.2million, much of it on his gambling addiction as he paid repeated visits to casinos. He frittered away £97,000 on chauffeur-driven cars and taxis alone, as well as a 'difficult divorce' and sending money to Thailand where he had a fiancee or wife. The fraud was finally exposed in 2013 when an audit uncovered a small discrepancy in the accounts. Harold initially tried to cover up it up by presenting auditors with false documents, but when that failed he confessed to his bosses. Yet his scam could have been stopped just a year after it began, the court heard. Harold's colleague Shamsur Rahman, 38, discovered the swindle in 2008 - then demanded a cut of the ill-gotten gains to keep quiet. Motivated by 'pure greed', father-of-three Rahman pocketed £1.1million which he used to put £300,000 towards a £600,000 house in north London. Large firm: Harold worked for 14 years at Devonshire Appontments, based in the heart of the City of London . Jailed: The pair were handed four years in prison today at the Old Bailey as a judge attacked Rahman's 'greed' He also bought a luxury £54,000 car and gave jewellery to his wife. Rahman, who is originally from Bangladesh, was later made redundant but continued asking Harold for money from the fraud, prosecutor James Norman said. When Rahman's home was searched by police, they also found £120,000 in cash stuffed in a rucksack, a bag and a jacket pocket. Harold, of Dagenham, Essex, who walks with a walking stick and suffers from hypertension and diabetes, admitted fraud by abuse of position. 'Greed': Colleague Shamsur Rahman discovered the scam - then took more than £1million to keep quiet . Rahman, of Enfield, north London, admitted acquiring criminal property and pledged to pay the money back. Jailing them each for four years, Recorder Michael Wood QC said: 'This was an appalling breach of trust by both of you. 'You, Mr Harold, were employed as a payroll administrator who was trained to use the computer system. You created false temporary staff to disguise payments to accounts controlled by you. 'In excess of 20 accounts were created and nearly £3million was taken from the fraud. It went on for six years and I have no doubt it would have continued but for an audit carried out and the fraud discovered.' 'I accept you showed great remorse - It’s hard to imagine a worse abuse of trust. 'You squandered your £1.2million in casinos and taxis and as I understand it you have nothing to show for it.' Addressing his co-defendant Rahman, the judge added: 'Your motivation was pure greed.' 'You were only able to repay the money because you were thrifty with the proceeds of the fraud, rather than frittering it away.'","Dennis Harold, 60, paid 'wages' to fake staff at recruitment firm Devonshire .

"What is the essence of Native American identity? That is what photographer Matika Wilbur sought to capture as she travelled the States taking images of hundreds of today's indigenous Americans in their everyday environments. Using fundraising website Kickstarter to help her travel 60,000 miles across the USA, Wilbur set out to photograph every recognised indigenous tribe in the United States, often resorting to sleeping on floors in pursuit of the perfect photograph. The result is Project 562, a collection of stunning images and extraordinary stories featuring people from 161 different nations. Scroll down for video . Photographer Matika Wilbur used Kickstarter to fund a project capturing hundreds of today's indigenous Americans in very modern environments. Pictured here are Sky and Talon Duncan who are world champion hoop dancers and part of the three affiliated tribes of Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Nation . Matika Wilbur has documented the lives of people from every recognised tribe in the USA, showing how they maintain their identity in 21st century America . Chief Bill James, affiliated to the tribe of Lummi nation, looks on wistfully beyond the frame of Matika's photo . To capture the essence of the ancient culture of these indigenous people the photographer travelled the length and breadth of the country . Darkfeather, Bibiana and Eckos Ancheta. Matika sought to emphasise the strength and positivity of these tribes, rather than the threat of their disappearance . Matika 'The Messenger' Wilbur, a graduate of the Rocky Mountain School of Photography, is herself from the Tulalip and Swinomish tribes of Washington and set out to celebrate Native Americans in the 21st century. By celebrating the achievements and heritage of these people groups, Matika says: 'I seek the positivity of Indian country, I look for our heroes; and we have them, they are walking among us. 'They are health professionals, athletes and culture bearers; they are our farmers that cultivate our indigenous seeds; our fisherman who navigate our sacred waters; our attorneys who protect our sovereignty; our activists that stand in solidarity and our uncles and grandpa’s who fight the good fight to protect our sacred sites and natural resources. And they have a story to tell.' As part of her project Wilbur photographed the Pechanga tribal culture leader by a 2000-year-old Oak tree, while learning about  controversies over water rights and  violence against native women. Juxtaposing modernity and history, Matika's photo depicts an indigenous American stands in front of a farm of wind turbines, looking out at the landscape . Wilbur wants to change the way native Americans are perceived, one photo at a time, and will continue with the project documenting tribes people for another two years . Some of the people the photographer encountered lived in remote and isolated reservations while others inhabited cities in larger groups . The former commercial photographer is using images, such as this portrait, to generate greater interest in tribal heritage and combat racism in the USA . Celebrating the achievements of these groups led the photographer to meet a range of indigenous people from health professionals to athletes and culture bearers . 'Sometimes I'll journey to an isolated reservation, other times I'll meet some of the 70 percent of Native Americans living in urban settings', she says. So far Project 562 has taken several years and she hopes to complete her documentation of the tribes people in the next two years. The former international journalist's mission is not the first of its kind: In 1906 photographer Edward S. Curtis was commissioned  to capture the 'disappearing' race. However, Matika says her project emphasises the strengths of the original inhabitants of the USA rather than their uncertain future and aims to encourage Americans to become more aware of indigenous communities and combat racism. Her aim is gaining momentum as the project has so far raised three times as much money as Matika had hoped for. The University of Washington Press has also now offered to publish Matika's portraits and stories in a series of books. Reflecting on her achievement so far, Matika says: 'The level of success and visibility that Project 562 has garnered has been a direct result of people’s commitment to change the way the world sees Native America.' Dr Mary Evelyn Belgarde of the Pueblo of Isleta and Ohkay Owingeh tribe. Although many  people work outside the Pueblos, they often return for ritual ceremonies . The project has gained a lot of media interest and Matika's Kickstarter fundraising project has already raised three times as much money as she was aiming to .

"Gus Poyet admits he was hurt by Phil Bardsley’s defection to Stoke after saving his Sunderland career. Bardsley fell out with previous Black Cats boss Paolo Di Canio after being pictured lying on the floor of a casino covered in £50 notes. He then mocked Sunderland’s defeat at home to Fulham last August with a post on Twitter and was suspended by the club. But Poyet – who replaced Di Canio in October - offered Bardsley a lifeline and he went on to play a key role in Sunderland’s journey to the League Cup final and escape from relegation. Gus Poyet resurrected Phil Bardsley's career but saw him leave for Stoke this summer . The 29-year-old returns to the Stadium of Light on Tuesday having joined the Potters on a free transfer after his deal on Wearside expired during the summer. And ahead of the Capital One cup third-round tie, Poyet said: ‘If I said I was disappointed I would not be telling the whole truth because it hurts badly. ‘I am very sad because we helped each other a lot. He was training elsewhere and we brought him back and he reacted in an incredible way. ‘He helped us to get safe and we helped him to come back into football. And then things happened. In football these things happen.’ He went on: ‘The first two (Bardsley and Jack Colback, who joined Newcastle) that we decided to negotiate with, they didn’t work, because everybody was playing the waiting game. Bardsley will line up for Stoke on Tuesday against the club he spent six years at between 2008 and 2014 . ‘That killed us a bit, for whatever reason. It was not like we were not agreeing, but it all depended on where we were the following season and maybe then it became too late. ‘Then players get an offer and sometimes it is difficult to equal as it is too much. That is a side of the game. It not about being greedy. Not at all. ‘The problem was timing. It was impossible. ‘You tell a player we cannot offer you a contract until we know we are in the Premier League or the Championship and they will say it all depends. ‘In the end that is what happened with Phil and it was difficult for him. It is tough for us. It hurt more than anything because he is not with me, but if he is happy and his family are happy then I’m alright because with it that is the most important thing. I hope we will see him on Tuesday.’ Poyet has revealed how upset he was that the defender left the Stadium of Light when his contract expired . Sunderland lost to Manchester City in last season’s final having beaten Chelsea and Manchester United en route to Wembley. They are expected to name a strong side against Stoke – including a debut for Uruguay defender Sebastian Coates – and defender Patrick van Aanholt said: ‘The club reached the final last year so it will be an important game for us. ‘The cups are special and it is all about one game rather than playing every week like we do in the league, so hopefully we can do well and progress to the next round.’ Bardsley had a good season for Sunderland last term, and scored in a 1-0 win against Manchester City .

"Olympic champion Sir Bradley Wiggins is optimistic of success in the Road World Championships time-trial in Ponferrada on Wednesday. Wiggins finished second to Germany's Tony Martin, the Olympic silver medallist, in Florence last year but is confident the 47.1-kilometre route favours his attributes this time around.

Wiggins was second in last year's Road World Championships time-trial but won it on the 2014 Tour of Britain . 'This year's course is a lot different to last year's, which was long and flat,' added Wiggins, who did not ride the Glasgow 2014 time-trial. 'You have to think more on this course. There's no room for error. 'You need to have enough in the tank for the end. It's challenging, a true test of the time trial.'

"The second detachment of American troops arrived in Monrovia this Sunday to bolster health services in the country according to a source speaking to Agence France-Press. The United States is expected to send a total of 3,000 soldiers to Liberia to train health workers fighting to contain the outbreak of Ebola that has so far claimed the lives of 2,800 across west Africa. 'Some American troops came soon this morning. They arrived with tactical jeeps,' said the unnamed source, who said the troops arrived in a single aircraft. Outbreak: Health workers in Liberia spray a suspected Ebola patient outside a facility run by Doctors Without Borders . The Pentagon announced Friday that a C-17 carrying equipment and 7 service personnel had already landed in Liberia. Two aircraft with a total of 45 troops were set to follow, according to Rear Admiral John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesperson. The U.S. mission in Liberia will be led by Major General Darryl Williams and undergo recruitment and training of health workers. Military engineers are also being dispatched to construct care centers for Ebola patients. The Ebola outbreak will likely be on the agenda when the United Nations General Assembly meets this week. A resolution adopted at the Security Council last Thursday called the outbreak of Ebola a 'threat to 'international peace and security.'

Reuters updated the death toll in the affected west African countries to more than 2,800. Sierra Leone imposed a three-day nationwide shutdown over the weekend to set the brakes against the spread of the virus. The State Department said it supported the measure, but the World Health Organization was critical, saying that quarantines should be 'proportionate and evidence-based.' The Pentagon has so far spent $30million as part of the United States' effort to train and support health workers. President Obama said that troops would not provide direct care to patients.","The first 7 soldiers arrived in Monrovia Thursday with 45 to arrive in the next 2 detachments .

"Intelligence agencies are closing the net on the masked ISIS executioner known as Jihadi John, Philip Hammond has revealed. The Foreign Secretary, who just ten days ago admitted special forces didn't know where the Islamic terror group was holding its British hostages, said the investigation into tracking down the killer with the British accent was 'narrowing down the field'. Speaking to American television network CNN at the United Nations summit in New York, Mr Hammond said: 'We are getting warm, we are working on all the leads. 'There's a big investigation and we are getting warm.  We're narrowing down the field, but I don't want to say any more at this stage.' Scroll down for video . The Foreign Secretary left, says they're 'narrowing down the field' in the hunt for masked ISIS killer Jihadi John . The Foreign Secretary also condemned the continuing hostage situation involving British aid worker Alan Henning, 47, after ISIS, also known as ISIL, sent an audio recording to his wife, Barbara, in which he pleads for his life. Mr Hammond told Wolf Blitzer, host of the Situation Room show: 'What we do know is Alan Henning was out there simply to help. 'He was a humanitarian worker who went with an aid convoy organised by British Muslim groups to provide support to refugees in Syria. 'He was doing good and I think it speaks volumes about ISIL that this is the way they are treating somebody who went out there to help their people and support their communities in their time of need.' The audio recording came after the United States and Arab allies began bombing parts of Syria where ISIS have gained a foothold, reportedly including the city of Raqqa where it is thought the former Salford taxi driver is being held. Mr Henning, who appeared at the end of a video of the murder of British aid worker David Haines, was kidnapped last December in Syria by ISIS militants and Mrs Henning has again pleaded for them to release him. In a statement issued by the Foreign Office, Mrs Henning said: 'We are at a loss [to understand] why those leading Islamic State cannot open their hearts and minds to the facts surrounding Alan's imprisonment and why they continue to threaten his life... 'He went to Syria to help his Muslim friends deliver much needed aid.' The Foreign Secretary condemned the Islamic terror group for holding British aid worker, Alan Henning, 47 . The militant extremist group has previously released footage showing the killings of American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff as well as Mr Haines. The man known as Jihadi John is believed to appear in all three videos and seems to speak with a British accent. A separate video released this week showed British photojournalist John Cantlie sitting at a desk reading from a prepared script and explaining that he would speak about ISIS in future videos. There was no threat to kill Mr Cantlie made on camera. When asked by Mr Blitzer about the UK policy of not paying ransoms to terrorists, Mr Hammond said 'absolutely right', and added he did not believe the Turkish government had paid for the release last weekend of 49 hostages held by ISIS. Ten days ago Mr Hammond was criticised for admitting that special forces did not know where ISIS was holding its British hostages. ISIS is still holding British journalist John Cantlie, 43, who appears in a new video warning against US strikes . Explaining why no SAS operation had been mounted to release hostages including Mr Henning and Mr Cantlie, the Foreign Secretary said: 'If we knew where they were, it would be a different story, but we don't.' His remarks were criticised by the former head of the Army, Richard Dannatt, who said he was 'surprised' Mr Hammond had spoken so freely. Lord Dannatt said: 'At the public level, not to have commented in that way would have kept uncertainty in the minds of terrorists. They would have remained concerned... 'Not to have revealed our hand as openly might have been a different course of action to take. He was trying to be open and helpful, but it might have been better to say that to the family privately. He would appear to have shown our hand.'","Philip Hammond was speaking to CNN at United Nations summit in New York .

"David Cameron will today seek to quell unrest over ‘bribes’ for Scotland – as senior Tories insist laws giving England equivalent powers must be passed within months. The Prime Minister has invited 20 MPs, including some of his fiercest backbench critics, to his country retreat, Chequers, to thrash out plans for ‘English votes for English laws’. Many Conservatives say powers over tax, welfare and spending must only be ceded to Edinburgh if Scottish MPs are barred from voting on them at Westminster. David Cameron is committed to the timetable for devolution agreed by the three main party leaders, according to a No 10 source . Scotland’s First Minister Alex Salmond, who is to stand down after last week’s No vote on independence, yesterday claimed Mr Cameron had tricked Scots voters. But No 10 sources insisted that he was committed to the timetable for devolution agreed by the three main party leaders. ‘No ifs, no buts, that will occur,’ said one. Plans for English votes for English laws would be unveiled at the same time, in January, but separately, the source said. All three party leaders will face uproar from many MPs if they press ahead with powers for Scotland but not England. The Prime Minister has invited 20 MPs, including some of his fiercest backbench critics, to his country retreat, Chequers, to thrash out plans for ‘English votes for English laws’ Scotland’s First Minister Alex Salmond claimed Mr Cameron had tricked Scots voters . Tory chief whip Michael Gove said at the weekend it would be ‘impossible’ to hand powers to Scotland without reassessing the status of Scottish MPs at Westminster. Mr Cameron said on Friday that further devolution must take place ‘in tandem with, and at the same pace’ as the dilution of Scottish MPs’ rights. The No 10 source said: ‘These issues will be considered in parallel and at the same time.’ But Mr Salmond said No voters would feel ‘tricked’. He told the BBC’s Sunday Politics: ‘The Prime Minister wants to link change in Scotland to change in England. He wants to do that because he has difficulty in carrying his backbenchers on this and they are under pressure from Ukip.’ Former Labour chancellor Alistair Darling, leader of the Better Together campaign, told the Andrew Marr programme: ‘The agreement reached by the three parties, as far as I am concerned, is non-negotiable. Anyone who welches on that will pay a very heavy price for years to come. There is a separate issue about what further constitutional change comes to the UK.’ Graham Brady, head of the 1922 committee of backbench Tories, said it was likely MPs would only approve powers for Scotland alongside a move to English votes for English laws. Mr Brady, invited to Chequers with former frontbenchers John Redwood and Bernard Jenkin, said it was a ‘basic principle of fairness and justice’. He added: ‘We’ve already got two classes of MPs. Since the devolution settlement was first introduced 15 years ago, we’ve had Scottish MPs who have been able to vote on laws relating to England when they can’t vote on the same matters relating to their own constituencies. So there is an unfairness there that already needed rectifying; the case is even stronger as we transfer more power.’ Mr Redwood, leader of the Tory campaign for a proper English settlement, called for a Commons vote on the so-called West Lothian question before the next election. Such a vote would put Labour MPs who disagreed on the wrong side of public opinion. He said: ‘If the other English MPs in other parties vote us down they will have to explain why.’ A No 10 source played down the idea, saying it was ‘not ruled out’ but depended on what a Cabinet committee chaired by William Hague proposed. Sir William McKay, the former clerk of the House of Commons, considered modest restrictions to the role of Scottish MPs in a report for the Government last year. He said more powers for Scotland would mean going further, and suggested that laws only affecting England should be passed via a double majority voting system, gaining the support of a majority of English MPs as well as a majority of the Commons as a whole.","David Cameron has invited 20 MPs to his country retreat, Chequers .

"A Muslim student at a top girls’ school has yet to start her A-levels because of a row over her wearing a full-face veil, it was revealed today. The unnamed 16-year-old pupil, who has attended Camden School for Girls in north London for the past five years without wearing the niqab, wants to enter the coeducational sixth form. But headmistress Elizabeth Kitcatt is understood to have banned her from joining the sixth form if she insists on wearing the full-face veil - because it goes against school rules. Scroll down for video . Uniform policy: The unnamed 16-year-old pupil, who has attended Camden School for Girls (pictured) in north London for the past five years without wearing the niqab, wants to enter the coeducational sixth form . The girl wants to wear the traditional Muslim veil so that her face and hair are covered while she studies - and more than 700 people have signed a petition calling the school’s move ‘Islamophobic’. Her sister Sagal Ahmed, 18, insisted the school’s refusal to let the girl wear a niqab had been ‘very upsetting’. She said: ‘My sister just wants to wear the niqab for her reasons and attend a school. ‘I don’t feel like her education should be compromised or the way she dresses should affect the way anyone looks at her.’ The school’s sixth form does not have a uniform, but has a dress code which it expects all students to follow. The headmistress said in a statement that they do not comment on individual cases. Full-face covering: The girl's sister insisted the school's refusal to let her wear a niqab (file picture) has been 'very upsetting' Mrs Kitcatt, 55, added: ‘We have an . appearance policy and students at the school may wear what they wish . subject to any requirement in the interests of teaching and learning, . health and safety. Inappropriate dress which offends public decency or which does not allow teacher-student interactions will be challenged.’ A petition headed ‘Stop the Islamophobia’ has been . started by an anonymous protester on the Change.org website. It says: ‘Camden School for Girls Sixth Form has refused to allow a 16-year-old student to study at the school as she wears a niqab. A niqab is a full veil that covers part of the face, only revealing the eyes. ‘The student has been studying at Camden School for Girls for five years. She sat her GCSEs this summer, and initially received a C in English language, which meant she could not attend the sixth form. ‘However, just a few weeks ago, the school called her up and informed her that she actually achieved an A grade, meaning that she could attend the sixth form she had been intending to go to. ‘This was amazing, right? She would be back with the same teachers, friends and place again. ‘But there was one problem: the niqab. The student only started to wear the niqab this year, and even sat her GCSE exams wearing the veil. ‘But this time, when the student returned to the school, wearing the niqab, a teacher claimed that she could not be allowed to study at the school.’ The petitioner claimed some students at the school wore the niqab in the past, adding: ‘This school is renowned for its “individuality” and “strong feminist views”. 'However, this poorly thought out decision made by the school contradicts this. What happened to ‘freedom of expression’?’ 'I don't feel like her education should be compromised or the way she dresses should affect the way anyone looks at her' Sagal Ahmed, sister . A former girl pupil who supports the petition, Farhana Khanom, commented on the website: ‘I went to Camden School for Girls and many girls wore veils and were allowed to do so. ‘This school had a reputation. And now discriminating (against) people that made their own choice to wear what they feel is utterly disgusting. ‘ . Former pupils at the school include Sarah Brown, the wife of former prime minister Gordon Brown, singer Geri Halliwell, and actresses Emma Thompson and Tamsin Greig.","Pupil wants to start at Camden School for Girls sixth form in London .

"A quiet revolution is taking place on the High Street. As you walk past shop windows, you may spot it: sleeves on dresses, flattering fits that are looser on the waist, and campaign shots that feature greying models. Elegant clothes for grown-ups, rather than styles for youthful fashion victims. And look around at who’s actually carrying bags, or shopping in giggling packs with friends — it’s not teenagers. They’re either buying online, or counting their pennies. Yamsin le Bon, 49, is the face of Winser London . The High Street is steadily being reclaimed by the 50-plus women it abandoned years ago. And no wonder: figures just this month revealed these women now spend £2.7 billion on clothes — accounting for 41 per cent of sales — with a staggering 90 per cent of British retailers seeing their fastest growth from this age group. Suddenly, shops are pulling out all the stops for a slice of the Grey Pound. For they’ve finally realised the over-50 woman — more likely to walk in, run her fingers over fabrics, and try on in dressing rooms, as opposed to buying blindly online before returning items (a huge hassle for retailers) — is the most desirable customer on the High Street. For stores that win her heart, the rewards are considerable. Bonmarché, aimed at the over-50s, has seen profits up 66 per cent in a year and even Marks & Spencer is starting to reap the benefits of its Leading Ladies campaign which featured Annie Lennox, 59, Emma Thompson, 55, and Doreen Lawrence, 61, with clothing sales returning to growth for the first time in three years. Winser London’s ‘face’ Yasmin Le Bon, who is fast approaching 50, is also a prime example of a new breed of mature woman. ‘Women over 75 are now shopping as frequently as those in their teens and 20s were in the Sixties,’ says the University of Kent’s Professor Julia Twigg, author of Fashion And Age. ‘Now, the lives of those in their 60s are not immensely different from those in their 40s. ‘It’s a difficult ask for the High Street. They’ve got to promote clothes that don’t have a label that says: “This is a frumpy dress for an older woman”, and yet cut in a way that flatters older figures. ‘The over-50s are not a funny little niche to be pandered to, but a market every bit as stylish, active and alert as their daughters — and with more disposable income.’ Jaeger is a case in point: in its new campaign, former fashion photographer Tessa Codrington, 70, looks directly at the camera, every bit as confident as her supermodel daughter Jacquetta Wheeler, beside her. The message is unequivocal: these are clothes that flatter older women, but are still fashion-forward enough to be desirable to her thirtysomething daughter. In fact, it seems the trick is to make this explicit enough to bring customers in, yet subtle enough to avoid offending said customers by telling them they’re ‘old’. Like much of the fashion industry — from M&S to Whistles and Next — Jaeger chased the glamour of youth and abandoned its core customer in the Noughties. ‘We tried to go too young, too fashionable — and that was a disaster,’ admits CEO Colin Henry. ‘We had to rethink.’ Lorraine Kelly, 50, modelling for JD Williams . The result is an autumn/winter collection that uses forgiving cuts and will work across generations, with a return to natural fabrics — more breathable, which can be useful for menopausal women. A simple grey jacket, £220, for example, is eminently wearable, but has details, such as raglan sleeves, that make it modern. But, while quality is often cited as an overriding concern for mature women, Professor Twigg also says much of the trick to luring back the over-50s is a good, old-fashioned bargain. While the babyboomer generation may be richer than their parents, they have also experienced 15 years of fast fashion, so are less willing to blow their pensions on one or two good items. And the section of the industry that responded first to that need was the catalogue and mail- order scene. The USP of brands such as JD Williams (which has signed up Lorraine Kelly as a model) Isme and Gray & Osbourn has long been offering a huge range of clothes carefully designed to fit the more mature figure, without losing out on the fun factor — providing an alternative to High Streets that, until recently, has made older women feel so unwelcome. They have helped spark a reassessment of just what the older woman wants to wear, exactly how it should fit, and how she shops. At JD Williams, contemporary fashions adapted for a more mature figure are key. What that means is more forgiving waists on well- tailored skirts and trousers, perhaps with hidden elastic or drawstring for flexibility, to account for the general redistribution of fat from hips to waist. Other popular features include secret support on jeans, lower bust darts to lift breasts, shaping panels on dresses, sleeves, longer hemlines, and slimming style details, such as bold patterns and ruching on the waist. Fabrics, too, are often less flimsy, with heavier cotton jersey, quilting, or knits that skim the body, rather than cling. Vibrant colours that flatter the skin and subtle neutrals are more popular than harsh black, which highlights wrinkles. ‘For our customers, looking good is a daily deal you make with yourself,’ says Rachael Thornton of upmarket Gray & Osbourn. ‘You can become “invisible”, and fall prey to bland, shapeless clothing, or you can rock what you’ve got.’ And this successful formula, which started among mail-order catalogues, now spans the High Street. Stores that have become huge successes, such as Whistles, John Lewis’s Kin, Damsel in a Dress, Jigsaw and even H&M’s spin-off Cos are packed with stylish, older women seeking out contemporary fashion, safe in the knowledge that the styles will fit and suit them. Marks & Spencer is starting to reap the benefits of its Leading Ladies campaign, which featured Baroness Doreen Lawrence, 61 (right) Emma Thompson, 55, and  Annie Lennox, 59, starred in Marks & Spencer's Leading Ladies campaign . Perhaps one of the most telling examples of this sea change is jeans, once a youth staple. Now, they are available in styles — and with stretch and panelling — that flatter more mature figures. The options are seemingly endless: Isme alone has everything from super-soft jeggings in its South line for £18, to high-waisted bootcut jeans by Not Your Daughter’s Jeans for £150, while shape-boosting denim is available everywhere from M&S in classic black for £35, toWizard Jeans in chic purple for £125. This effect is not confined to clothing, either: Peter Taylor, managing director at Hotter shoes, has noted a distinct change in the requirements of his customers in recent years — they are now taking style tips from their daughters, unlike the more formal pre-war generation, who took their dress sense from their mothers. Over 50s are getting younger in their attitude and lifestyles (posed by model) ‘One of the best-selling shoes we have is a canvas-print, which has stretch panels in the side, and can be worn by anyone from an 18-year-old to an 80-year-old,’ he says. ‘Our customers loved our comfort, but wanted more style.’ Eighty per cent of over-50s have problems with their legs and feet, according to Taylor, though most simply don’t recognise that their feet are changing shape. ‘How we tackle that is the design of our shoes,’ he says. ‘we’ve done a lot of research in what is the right fit for people — things like the toebox area, that’s where there can be a lot of change and you need more room. Other considerations are adjustability, with Velcro,for example.’ Other traditionally comfortable shoe brands are also upping the glam factor in search of the grey pound: M&S’s sturdy Footglove range, for example, has had something of a makeover, with shoes every bit as stylish as the main range — but hidden benefits, including wider shapes, softer materials and Insolia Flex soft innersoles. ‘The generation now hitting their 50s are getting even younger in their attitude and lifestyles,’ says Taylor. ‘They’re highly active and highly social. Their footwear wardrobe is widening because they want a particular product for a particular aspect of their life, whether that’s adventure holidays, lunch with friends, fancy dinners, or fitness.’ Professor Twigg agrees: ‘A lot of the work on old age tends to focus on problematic things; difficulties — all very important, but it misses the fact that later years, for many people, aren’t necessarily problematic, but do contain all sorts of good things such as choices about clothing, leisure, those sort of things.’ Finally, it seems, the High Street has caught up.","Shop windows are boasting elegant clothes for grown-ups, rather than styles for youthful fashion victims .

"A mother has warned parents of venomous spiders after her daughter, four, was bitten in her bedroom and left with a swollen leg and red rash which spread over her body. Penny Jordan, 38, called paramedics after a red patch on her daughter Elle's body began to spread from her leg to her stomach and neck, her foot ballooned and she developed a fierce temperature. Doctors have confirmed that a spider was responsible, and Ms Jordan says she has no doubt that Elle was bitten by one of the 'huge' creatures she has seen at her home in Northfield, Birmingham. Scroll down for video . Warning: Penny Jordan (right) has warned parents of venomous spiders after her daughter Elle, four, was bitten in her bedroom and left with a swollen leg and red rash which spread over her body . Rash: A red patch on her daughter Elle's body began to spread from her leg to her stomach and neck, her foot ballooned and she developed a fierce temperature . 'They're huge,' said the mother-of-seven. 'But because they come into the house from outside, there is not a lot we can do. I have six grandchildren. I don't want the same happening to them.' In recent weeks a number of larger than normal spiders have been spotted across the country as the warm summer has meant the spiders have had more to eat, and have not been killed off by falling temperatures. Ms Jordan and her partner Pete Hands had noticed the rash on Elle's body on Sunday afternoon, and called for an ambulance. 'I want to make parents aware that a simple insect bite can have serious consequences,' she said. 'I was horrified as the rash spread. It looked like she'd been severely scalded. They were just like burn marks.' Suffering: Elle, who was forced to pull out of her first full day primary school on Monday, had woken up with a livid red patch on the top of her leg . Elle, who was forced to pull out of her first full day primary school on Monday, had woken up with a livid red patch on the top of her leg. Within hours, it had spread over her body, and her temperature was rising. Her parents took the child to a walk-in medical centre where staff discovered a bite was to blame and prescribed a course of tablets. However, the medication did nothing to stem the rash and when it moved to Elle's neck paramedics were called. Ambulance staff helped make Elle comfortable, but she did not need to go to hospital. 'At first we thought Elle had been bitten outside, but I've seen some very large spiders in her bedroom and wonder if one of those attacked while she was asleep.' Britain may not be noted for its dangerous creatures, but is home to 14 spider species that can deliver a painful bite. Most venomous is the false widow, which has moved to this country from abroad, but bites from cupboard, woodlouse, lace weaver, black lace weaver, wolf, bark sac, stone, cross, money and wasp spiders can also be painful. To blame? The family suspect that Elle was attacked by a giant house spider, similar to the one pictured, which are common visitors to homes in autumn and often found in baths . The family suspect that Elle was attacked by a giant house spider - a common visitor to homes in autumn and often found in baths. They can grow to five inches and possess a potent venom, but do not usually strike. Spider expert Professor Adam Hart explained the surge in sightings. 'This year has been seemingly a good one for the invertebrates which spiders feed on, and it's quite mild out there,' he said. But he stressed the spiders do more good than harm, providing a free pest control service. 'They often feed on the most common species, preventing a few species from becoming dominant,' he said. 'We want to encourage people to respect and learn more about their little house guests.' There are three types of allergic reactions to stings or bites: minor localised, large localised and systemic. The latter is potentially life-threatening. 'If you have a large localised reaction after being bitten or stung by an insect, a large area around the bite or sting will swell up,' said an NHS spokesman. 'The area may measure up to 12 inches across, or your entire arm or leg could swell up. 'The swelling will usually last longer than 48 hours, but should start to go down after a few days. 'You’re more likely to have a systemic reaction if you’ve been bitten or stung before and become sensitised, particularly if it was recently.'","Penny Jordan, 38, called 999 after daughter Elle, four, was bitten by spider .

"A hero pilot had voiced concerns about flying overweight planes just days before he died in a crash landing he was forced to undertake that saved the lives of his nine passengers. Robert Mansell, 32, managed to safely land his twin-engined aircraft near land in the Caribbean after sending out a mayday message when an engine failed. His expert flying enabled his nine Dutch passengers to escape the aircraft and they were picked up by rescue boats, off the island of Curacao. Tragically, Mr Mansell, from Knowle, Solihull, died after being knocked out when the aircraft hit the ocean. Passengers on the October 22, 2009, flight tried to save him but his safety harness was damaged and they couldn’t release him from the cockpit. VIDEO Scroll down to see footage of those saved by Mansell at the crash site . A postmortem revealed the 32-year-old died from drowning, after suffering a head injury in the crash landing . But the pilot's skillful crash landing ensured he had saved the lives of his nine Dutch passengers . Mr Mansell pictured with his Dutch girlfriend Myrte. He died at the age of 32 . Pictured left is Mr Mansell prior to takeoff on one of his flights, and right centre, as a teenager with friends . The plane was travelling from Curacao to Bonaire (pictured inset) in the Caribbean when the accident happened . The plane sank 600ft to the bottom of the ocean minutes after hitting the water. An inquest into his death was held at Birmingham Coroner’s Court yesterday. A postmortem revealed Robert died from drowning, after suffering a head injury. The inquest revealed that he had expressed concerns about the overloading of the British-made Britten-Norman plane to his bosses at Divi Divi Air on a number of occasions. He had also spoken to his father Roger about safety fears in the days before his death. The inquest heard from Air Accident Investigator Timothy Atkinson, who said the maximum weight limit for the plane was 6,250lbs but the crashed plane had weighed in at 7,211lbs. An investigation revealed the company was regularly sending planes into the skies dangerously overweight, he claimed. Passengers were also not weighed but an average weight taken for each person getting on the plane. Mr Atkinson said an aeroplane could cope with being overweight with two working engines but not when one fails. The Dutch Safety Board carried out its own investigation and made recommendations to the Curacao Aviation Authority to address the issues of flying overweight aircraft and to tighten controls. Mr Atkinson told the inquest: 'The overloading of the planes was a systemic habit with the airline.' After the inquest, his father Roger Mansell (pictured) said his son was renowned for his 'infectious courage' Mr Mansell was known for his skills at playing guitar and singing, and his love of motorcycles and cars . Mr Mansell pictured as an 8-year-old with his family. Mr Mansell was born into a family of pilots . Mr Mansell, left, relaxing in the Caribbean where he  worked as a pilot, and on the right, as a child aged 10 . Mr Mansell, pictured right with a friend, had been living in the Netherlands Antilles since 2008 . The inquest revealed the plane’s right engine cut out shortly after taking off from Hato airport to Flamingo, some 40 miles away from the crash scene. Mr Atkinson said Mr Mansell could have turned around and headed back to Hato Airport but made the decision to carry on to Flamingo after alerting air traffic control to the situation. But only seconds away from land he was forced to ditch his plane into the sea. The force of impact smashed his cabin windscreen and water started pouring into the cabin. He was knocked out and despite the efforts of fellow passengers they weren’t able to free him and he sank to the bottom of the ocean with the plane. The jury recorded a narrative verdict which said the 'aircraft was significantly overweight.' Mr Mansell was a former pupil at Arden School and Solihull Sixth Form College and had studied aeronautical engineering at Bristol University before obtaining his pilot licence in 2006. He became a captain shortly after. He had moved to the Solomon Islands in 2007 where he worked as a pilot before moving to the Netherlands Antilles in 2008 and he had a Dutch girlfriend called Myrte.

He had moved to the Solomon Islands in 2007 where he worked as a pilot before moving to the Netherlands Antilles in 2008. Mr Mansell is pictured in the background giving a thumbs-up . Speaking after the inquest, his father Roger, a retired civil aviation engineer, paid tribute to his son who he labelled a 'hero.' The 78-year-old said: 'Robert had spoken to me about his concerns with regards to the plane regularly being overloaded on several occasions and had made his concerns known to his employers. Nothing was ever done to address the issue.' He said his son was renowned for his 'infectious' character and courage, doing bungee jumps and cage diving with sharks on his travels. The father said: 'I am so proud of him in every way. He was a wonderful son who lived live to the full. He loved his motorcycles and his cars and was a tremendous guitarist and singer. He was a man of many talents. Robert Mansell's plane pictured once it had been pulled from the ocean after the crash . 'As a pilot myself I know the difficulty of landing these planes in the situation he found himself in. If he wasn’t a good pilot, he couldn’t have ditched it so everyone could be saved. Other pilots wouldn’t have known what to do - but he landed the aircraft so that everyone could get out safely. If he hadn’t ditched the aircraft properly it could have somersaulted over and would have most likely killed everyone on board. 'I am so proud of him - he really is a hero.' He described his son as 'an incredible force of nature'. The father of two, who broke down in tears as he spoke, said: 'He was just an incredible person. He loved anything mechanical, he loved his motorbikes. 'He went off to study both mechanical and aeronautical engineering at university and aced that. 'Then he went to qualify to be a pilot, he worked his way through all the qualifications until he had the equivalent of a PHD in flying. 'He had been offered a job flying safaris in Africa before he went to the Caribbean for another job offer. He just loved to travel, all his friends did. 'I could write a book about that plane crash, as you know I worked in aviation myself, but that's all been done now. Mr Mansell (pictured) was described by one of the passengers as a hero in a letter to his father . In the wake of the accident, a survivor whose life he had saved spoke of Mr Mansell's heroic actions. Dutch passenger Erik Hagendoorn wrote a letter to Mr Mansell's father Keith, stating his profound thanks to his hero son. It said: 'Robert, I want you to know that I am grateful and very proud that you were our pilot. 'I know for sure that you gave us all a chance to escape. 'Robert, each day after the accident on 22nd of October I think of you. 'I think of you as a pilot, I think of Myrte and the life you both planned, I think of your family and friends. 'I think also how blessed I am that I can still hug and kiss my wife Inez and daughters Anouk, Kim, Sacha and Milou.' Mr Mansell's father Robert said there were plans being made for Mr Hagedoorn to visit him before Christmas for a special memorial ceremony. 'He met a beautiful Dutch girl in the Netherlands Antilles and they had plans together for the future before it all came to a sudden end. 'I have had people from all over the world contact me since he died. Every one of the passengers has spoken to me, and talked about how he saved their lives. Pilots have to go through six monthly tests and he aced every single one of them. 'He was just a very, very popular and brilliant young man. 'The moment his friends heard about the crash they all jumped on a plane to go out there, that's how much loyalty he inspired. 'His sister loved him so much and he was the apple of his mother's eye, although her time also came early. 'When I think of what he did it makes me incredibly proud, but it also makes me cry. We miss him so much. He was just a force of nature, we were lucky to have known him and got to spend time with him. He was a born leader and just flew up the rankings as a pilot, the recession hit his career but he was back on track.

"A 20-year-old cyclist bled to death 24 hours after he was sent home from an understaffed hospital with a ruptured spleen, an inquest heard today. John Moore-Robinson died on 2 April 2006 - a day after he was discharged from scandal-hit Stafford Hospital by Dr Girish Kumar Sharma. He was left waiting for treatment at the A&E department for 70 minutes despite the ambulance crew saying his condition was 'life-threatening' after a mountain biking accident in Cannock Chase. John Moore-Robinson who died just 24 hours after being discharged from the scandal-hit Stafford General Hospital in April 2006 . The telecommunications engineer was diagnosed with bruised ribs and told he could leave, but collapsed at his home in Sileby, Leicester, less than 24 hours later. Despite being rushed to Leicester Royal Infirmary he died a short time later, the inquest at Leicester Coroners Court heard. Matron Jacqueline Keogh, who was not working at Stafford Hospital at the time but has investigated Mr Moore-Robinson's treatment, told the hearing that his priority should have been more urgent. She said: 'The ambulance report notes Mr Moore-Robinson was complaining of respiratory problems. He was pale and fully conscious. He was left waiting for treatment at the A&E department for 70 minutes despite the ambulance crew saying his condition was 'life-threatening', pictured with his grandmother . Janet and Frank Robinson campaigned for a fresh hearing after new evidence came to light about the death of their son . 'The crew evaluated his condition as life-threatening. When they arrived at the hospital at 15.55, his priority was indicated as intermediate. 'The immediate nurses checked his vital signs. They took Mr Moore-Robinson's heart rate and blood pressure. Doctor Sharma examined him at 17.35. 'I am aware that Mr Moore-Robinson's cause of death was a ruptured spleen. I would have insisted Mr Moore-Robinson's priority to have been more urgent. 'I would expect that a patient of this mechanism of injury could have been safely managed better. 'During the initial period of time this patient was seen, between 16.00 and 19.20, we had 19 major patients and 90 minors. 'If a patient was well enough to go home, he should have been advised not to be alone during the night. 'The nurses should have informed the nurse in charge that he should not have been discharged. Staff nurse Mark Saville told the inquest that when he started working at the Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust in 2006, the hospital was  short-staffed . In 2009, it emerged hundreds of patients could have died unnecessarily because of shocking levels of care in the Stafford Hospital's A&E department . 'Mr Moore-Robinson should have been allocated a more senior doctor.' Dr Sharma told the inquest he had only been working in the A&E department for four months when he examined Mr Moore-Robinson. He said: 'I was not aware of any special mention of the paramedic's comments only the condition being life-threatening. 'The priority of the patient was not determined by which cubical they were allocated, unless a specific concern was raised. 'It was not satisfactory for a one hour and 10 minute wait. If the nurse in charge had specifically said 'this person needs to be seen urgently', they would have been seen to. I would have expected to have been directly informed. 'Mr Moore-Robinson's main concern was respiratory. I think I carried out a full examination.' 'I do not clearly remember when he first came in.' Mr Moore-Robinson's heart pulse rate fluctuated between 104 beats per minute to 84 beats per minute during the two hours he was in A&E. In reference to the pulse rate, Dr Sharma said: 'What appeared normal to me, looking back in hindsight, was not normal. 'Obviously he was in a bit of pain but nothing to suggest more than acute distress during examination.' An inquest in 2007 recorded a narrative verdict, which is when the cause of death is not attributed to a named individual. But his parents Frank and Janet, both 61 and from Coalville, Leicester, campaigned for a fresh hearing after new evidence came to light. In April this year Leicestershire Coroner Catherine Mason was forced to adjourn the hearing so new witnesses could be traced. The inquest today heard the A&E department had been seriously understaffed. Staff nurse Mark Saville told the inquest: 'When I started working in the trust in 2006, we were short-staffed. 'We only had three nurses in majors on 1 April 2006. Since then the position has improved significantly. 'We also had a lot of very sick patients in, who if this happened now, would be in special units in Wolverhampton or Stoke. 'Checks on patients should be done as soon as possible and on a regular basis. The recognised standard for major injury patients is one every hour. 'Any decisions taken to move patients from the department were taken by management.'

"Her blonde hair neatly coiffed and dressed in a chic Bruno Oldfield suit, the Duchess of Cornwall was every inch the royal style icon as she arrived for a service at Westminster Abbey this afternoon. But for once, the royal wasn't the centre of attention, with that honour going to veterans of the Battle of Britain who had gathered for a thanksgiving celebration to mark the 74th anniversary of the World War II fight. Standing alongside Prince Charles, the Duchess watched as a Spitfire and a Hurricane performed a fly-past over the cathedral as a mark of remembrance to the men who fought and died in the first major aerial campaign of the war. Scroll down for video . Royal salute: Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall were at Westminster Abbey for the service . The battle, which took place between July and October 1940, was one of the turning points of the war but left 544 RAF pilots and aircrew dead as they fought to save Britain from a German invasion. The annual service marks the victory bought by a force which, along with Britons, also included men from Australia, Belgium, Canada, Czechoslovakia, France, Ireland, Jamaica, Newfoundland, New Zealand, Poland, Rhodesia [now Zimbabwe], South Africa and the US. Having thwarted Germany's invasion plan by stopping the Luftwaffe from controlling the skies over southern England, Winston Churchill memorably declared: 'Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few.' Ever since, those who fought in the battle are proudly known as 'The Few'. Along with Battle of Britain veterans, . the congregation also included families of serving soldiers as well as . the Prince of Wales, who, as the Air Chief . Marshal of the RAF, wore his full ceremonial uniform, and the Duchess of Cornwall. Annual event: The service is held each year in memory of the brave men who fought in the Battle of Britain .

Canon Vernon White greeted the royal upon arrival, ahead of a service which saw a succession of clergymen pay tribute to the bravery of those who fought. RAF chaplain-in-chief, the Venerable Air Vice Marshal Jonathan Chaffey told the congregation that the battle was a daily routine of 'adrenaline and fear', of 'camaraderie and loss' but also highlighted the strength of the human spirit. With this in mind, he praised last week's Invictus Games, which were championed by Prince Harry and were backed by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge as well as the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall. An international sporting event for wounded, injured or sick servicemen and women, participants came all over the world, including Afghanistan, Australia and Canada, as well as the UK. 'There was the sacrifice of ""The Few"" but also the industry and determination of the many, a whole force in a great cause,' added Air Vice Marshal Chaffrey. 'The Battle of Britain deserves a special place in our corporate minds. The competitors in the Invictus Games have sent a powerful message of what can be achieved despite adversity.'

"Israeli soldiers this morning killed two Palestinians suspected of the abduction and murder of three Israeli teens - the crisis that spiralled into a seven-week assault on Gaza. Security forces had spent months hunting Marwan Kawasme and Amar Abu Aysha, militants in their 30s from the Hebron area, after naming them as the killers of the Israeli teens. The killings came after Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, said yesterday we will this week ask the UN for an international resolution to end Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories. Scroll down for video . Revenge: Israeli teens Eyal Yifrah, 19, Gilad Shaar, 16, and Naftali Fraenkel, a 16-year-old with dual Israeli-American citizenship, who disappeared while hitchhiking home near the West Bank city of Hebron on June 12 . Palestinian civil defence members, near a burning shop, pick up a dead body after he was shot by the Israeli military during an Israeli security services operation in the southern West Bank city of Hebron . Recovery: The civil defense members move the body onto a pallet . Israeli military members stand over the body of one of the suspects . Hebron residents said soldiers surrounded a house in the city before dawn. Then there were sounds of gunfire, they said. IDF spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Peter Lerner said Kawasme and Abu Aysha were killed in a firefight. 'We opened fire, they returned fire and they were killed in the exchange,' Lt-col Lerner said. 'We have visual confirmation for one. The second one, we have no visual confirmation, but the assumption is he was killed.' Palestinian officials have not confirmed the men were killed. The two men were affiliated with the Hamas militant group which runs Gaza, and a group leader praised their deed in August, though other top officials denied any advance knowledge. Israeli forces began West Bank sweeps and rounded up hundreds of suspected Hamas members after the three teens, Jewish seminary students Eyal Yifrach, 19, and 16-year-olds Gilad Shaer and Naftali Fraenkel, went missing. Escorted by bodyguards, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu arrives to a special cabinet meeting at his Jerusalem office in Israel . Their bodies were found in June near Hebron. After initially denying involvement in the killings, Hamas last month acknowledged responsibility. The arrest of several hundred Palestinians in house-to-house raids across the West Bank stoked hostilities with Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, leading it to retaliate with rocket fire. Israel launched an offensive on July 8. Gaza medical officials say 2,100 Palestinians, mostly civilians, were killed. Sixty-seven Israeli soldiers and six civilians in Israel were also killed. The bloody offensive on Gaza has strengthened calls for the Palestinian government to join multilateral institutions including the International Criminal Court. Joining the court could potentially open the door to war crimes charges against Israel, both for its military actions in Gaza and for ongoing construction of Jewish settlements on occupied lands. Mr Abbas spoke yesterday in a lecture at Cooper Union college. He is set to speak before the UN General Assembly on Friday and is meeting with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry today. Palestinians hurl stones at Israeli troops after they shot dead the wanted  militants . Devastation: A Palestinian boy rides a bicycle between the ruins of houses destroyed during the seven-week Israeli offensive in Gaza, which killed 2,100 people, most of them civilians and many of them children . The recent Gaza war has weakened Mr Abbas domestically, with Hamas enjoying a surge of popularity among Palestinians for fighting Israel. He is under pressure at home to come up with a new political strategy after his repeated but failed attempts to establish a Palestinian state through U.S.-mediated negotiations with Israel. Abbas adviser Nabil Abu Rdeneh has said the Palestinian leader would present a new strategy in a speech to the UN General Assembly on Friday. In recent weeks, Mr Abbas and his aides have hinted at the outlines. Under the plan, Abbas would ask the UN Security Council to issue a binding resolution, with a specific date for ending Israel's occupation of the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem. Captured by Israel in 1967, the territories were recognized by the UN General Assembly in 2012 as making up a state of Palestine. In the event of a likely U.S. veto at the Security Council, Mr Abbas will seek membership in dozens of international institutions and agencies, including the International Criminal Court. The U.S. has urged Abbas not to turn to the Security Council, but has not offered an alternative, said a Palestinian official.","Security forces opened fire after surrounding a house in Hebron, West Bank .

Letters may take up to three days to arrive in the mailbox unless customers pay more for a priority service as part of an Australia Post plan to cut costs . The proposed cuts to delivery services were announced as Australia Post's managing director Ahmed Fahour revealed the company's mail section lost $328.4 million in the last year financial year. Mr Fahour said the new priority service would reflect the cost of delivery, with the current 70 cent cost of a stamp not covering the service, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission would need to approve the price of a priority stamp before it could be implemented and Communication Minister Malcolm Turnbull would have the right to appeal the decision, according to his spokesman. The proposed cuts to delivery services were announced as Australia Post's managing director Ahmed Fahour revealed the company's mail section lost $328.4 million in 2013-14 . Australia Post's dwindling mail service is delivering a third fewer letters than five years ago and Mr Fahour said the letter division could post a $6.6 billion loss in the next 10 years unless cuts were made. 'Unfortunately without significant and urgent reform of our community service obligations, the loss in the regulated mail business will overwhelm the entire company and result in the enterprise making a loss in the near future,' Mr Fahour said in a statement.

"Philadelphia sports fans have become infamous for their bad behavior, and it was on display once again last night when they learned the Philadelphia Flyers Ice Girls, a swarm of scantily clad, pretty young things responsible for cleaning the ice between periods during home games, had been replaced with an all-male crew. It all happened when the Flyers took on the Toronto Maple Leafs Monday night at the Wells Fargo Center in a pre-season game, and a group of men, and not women, hit the ice to do some cleaning. The boos and jeers inside the stadium were deafening as these gentlemen, who, unlike their predecessors, got to wear pants and a fleece, went to work on the ice. Scroll down for videos . Penalty box: The Philadelphia Flyers Ice Girls (above), who would clean the ice between periods, have been axed by the team . Not fan favorites: The girls were ditched in favor of an all-male crew (above), who also get to enjoy clothing more suitable for the frigid temperature on the ice . There is still no word yet on just why the Ice Girls were replaced, but one of the group's former members, Erika Choi Smith, did break the news on her Twitter this August. 'No #FlyersIceGirls this year, but just wanted to say thanks to one of our biggest fans @FlyersNation & to all #Flyers Fans for being AWESOME,' she wrote. The girls would hit the ice every game wearing nothing but a midriff-baring top, hot pants, leg warmers and their skates, not the best outfit for a place where the temperatures is around 50 degrees. The Philadelphia Flyers also play an outdoor classic every year, where the temperature is about 20 degrees. Freezing work conditions: The girls' costumes (above left and right) consisted of little more than a midriff-baring top, hot pants and leg warmers . Poor treatment: According to a profile published earlier this year, the girls were underpaid, not allowed to speak to the athletes, and could not eat while in costume . Mother Jones wrote an article about the Ice Girls last year, and the all-female cleaning crew for another hockey team, the  Los Angeles Kings, highlighting how little the girls were paid and the many strict rules they had to adhere too. Among other things, the girls were not allowed to eat in public while wearing their costume and could not fraternize with any of the athletes, being told they should leave a bar or restaurant if they were out and one of the players came in. This negative coverage could be why the Ice Girls were replaced by the new all-male cleaning crew.","Philadelphia Flyers fans got very angry this week when they learned the team had replaced the Ice Girls with an all-male cleaning crew .

"The head of Labour’s biggest union donor today called on Ed Miliband to stop wooing middle class voters and increase the minimum wage to £8 an hour immediately. Unite chief Len McCluskey said the Scottish referendum had exposed the anger of working class voters ignored by the main political parties. He said it was time for Labour to stop tailoring policies to ‘a few marginal voters in southern England’ and to focus on ‘working people’. Mr McCluskey dismissed Labour's pledge to increase the minimum wage by £1.50 over the next five years and attacked Ed Balls's plan to make real terms cuts to child benefit. He said: ‘We’ve been calling for a £1.50 increase in the minimum wage with immediate effect, not over a five-year period so we’d hope to continue to battle.’ Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said Labour should stop trying to appeal to middle class voters in the south . Mr McCluskey also slammed David Cameron’s bid to ban Scottish MPs from voting on English-only laws. He said his Union did not was a constitution ‘made by posh boys in Chequers’. In a fiery speech to the Labour conference in Manchester today, the Unite firebrand said the party was losing working-class voters. Earlier, Mr McCluskey said over the last few weeks people had begun to realise that ‘working people – our people – were turning their backs’ on Labour. He said: ‘But even after the SNP started winning Scottish parliament seats in the east end of Glasgow, some in the Scottish Labour party clung to the mantra of wooing the middle classes . ‘It took a referendum campaign to remind us that you ignore the hopes of working people at your political peril.’ Ed Miliband needed to learn the lessons from the Scottish referendum, Mr McCluskey said . Mr McCluskey said the support for independence in Scotland was not an ‘upsurge of narrow nationalism’. He said: ‘It was an upsurge in defence of our NHS. An upsurge against illegal wars. An upsurge against endless austerity. And against inequality.’ The Unite general secretary claimed Alex Salmond led a movement which was ‘a triumph of hope against apathy and fear’. He urged Labour to take a leaf out of Mr Salmond’s book and fight to win back working-class voters. He said: ‘We have to lead the fight for those aspirations, in every corner of our nations, over the next eight months, because it’s not just Scottish working people that want change. ‘Working people, young and old, throughout England and Wales have also had enough - had enough of the attack on the health service and the gains of 1945. Had enough talk of economic credibility which means credibility with the bond markets - but not with the unemployed.’ He claimed many poorer voters had also had enough ‘of policies trimmed and tailored to a few marginal voters in southern England’. To loud applause from delegates, Mr McCluskey said the Scottish referendum should be the tombstone on 20 years of Labour's ‘indifference’ to the interests of workers.","Unite chief said  Scottish referendum exposed anger of working class voters .

"Gordon Brown gave Labour rising star Chuka Umunna ‘the hairdryer treatment’ in a blistering phone call after the shadow business secretary publicly blamed him for Labour’s struggles on the economy. Mr Brown attacked the shadow cabinet minister for an interview he gave criticising the former Labour leader’s failure to confront Britain’s ballooning deficit in the run up to the 2010 election. Mr Umunna said Mr Brown’s refusal to even talk about Government ‘cuts’ was still costing Labour support, because it made the party look like it did not care about the deficit. Labour are currently 25 points behind the Tories on which party is best for the economy. Scroll down for video . Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna (left) and Gordon Brown (right) clashed on the phone over Labour's record on the economy . But the remarks sparked a furious response from Mr Brown, MailOnline has learnt. The former Prime Minister told Mr Umunna that he should not accept Tory claims that Labour was spending too much before the last general election, a senior Labour source revealed. The source said: ‘He still cannot accept Labour was running a structural deficit. Even after all this time he won’t accept that he was wrong – it’s unbelievable.’ The deficit – the difference between Government spending and how much it raises in taxes each year – was more than £160 billion in 2010. Labour blamed the huge borrowing splurge on the global recession – because the Government was forced to withstand a huge hit on tax revenue as people lost their jobs, while at the same time increasing spending on benefits. But analysis has since revealed that the ‘structural deficit’ – the amount of borrowing needed even when the economy is growing normally – had grown to more than £100 billion in the last year of the Labour government. In an interview with GQ magazine, published this month, Mr Umunna said Mr Brown’s refusal to face up to the deficit was still hurting the Labour Party. He said: ‘My view is that the seeds were sown under the last government and Gordon - for whom I have a lot of respect - his refusal to use the word “cuts” in trying to frame the economic debate as investment versus cuts gave the impression we didn't understand that debt and deficit would have to be dealt with.’ Shadow chancellor Ed Balls (left) and the Labour leader Ed Miliband (right), who were both Treasury aides under Gordon Brown, have defended the party's record controlling Government spending . A source close to Mr Umunna confirmed the pair spoke in a telephone call after the interview was published earlier this month. The source said: ‘It is something they disagree on. ‘Chuka’s argument has always been that pursuing the line that it was Labour spending versus Tory cuts allowed Osborne to make the whole election debate about deficit reduction. They spoke and that is definitely still his view.’ A spokesman for Mr Umunna said: 'Chuka and Gordon are both members of the PLP - or course they speak to each other on a range of issues. Chuka has great respect for Gordon.' It is understood that on this occasion Mr Umunna initiated the call. Conservative MP Henry Smith said the confrontation between Mr Brown and Mr Umunna revealed a 'divided' Labour Party. He said: 'This shows a Labour party still in denial about the record deficit they left behind and with no plan to deal with our debts and ensure a more financially secure future for Britain. 'Brown’s intervention begs the question who’s in charge of a clearly split and infighting Labour leadership team.'","EXCLUSIVE: Source reveals extraordinary call by ex Prime Minister .

"One of Labour MP Keith Vaz's ancestors, the 'Blessed Joseph Vaz, is set to be made a saint . Labour’s showman backbencher Keith Vaz is not known as a man lacking in self-regard. As the high profile chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, Mr Vaz has won respect across the House of Commons. But his colleagues fear he may have his eyes on an even higher prize – after it emerged that one his ancestors is in line to become a saint. The Blessed Joseph Vaz, a 17th-century missionary known as the Apostle of Ceylon, is likely to be canonised in January, when Pope Francis visits Sri Lanka. Home Affairs Committee member Paul Flynn said canonisation was a ‘family trait’ which may spur on the Leicester MP to aim for greater things. He said: ‘This news will bring deep satisfaction to the members of the committee. It has certainly made my day. ‘I know that Keith has a picture of the Pope in his office. What we don’t know if whether the Pope has a picture of Keith on his wall. ‘We can but hope that the announcement today is a harbinger of great things to come for Keith. 'There’s only a few accolades left for him to win.’ Mr Flynn, a veteran Labour backbench MP, suggested the news may help attract an even greater class of witness to Mr Vaz’s committee. Celebrities including Russell Brand, Shilpa Shetty and Mitch Winehouse have already been called to give evidence to MPs. But Mr Flynn said: ‘He already has an impressive list of contacts, but this can only help.’ Pope Francis is likely to canonise 'the Blessed Joseph Vaz', a 17th-century missionary known as the Apostle of Ceylon when he visits Sri Lanka in January . Mr Vaz said he was delighted with the news, but revealed he was unlikely to be allowed to visit Sri Lanka because of his outspoken criticism of the country’s treatment of the Tamil minority. He said: ‘People are always proud to say they are related to royalty, but few MPs can boast of a saint in the family.’ A senior Labour source said: ‘Is there no end to the Vaz family’s talents?’","The 17th-century missionary is likely to be canonised in January .

"After viewing photographs of Mr Balls’ challenge on Rob Merrick, former top referee Graham Poll said the portly Shadow Chancellor was lucky not to have been sent off. The shadow chancellor yesterday morning left an opposition player bloodied and bandaged after clashing during an annual MPs versus journalists football match at the Labour Party conference. Mr Balls caught the Northern Echo’s Westminster correspondent Rob Merrick with a thumping forearm as they challenged for the ball during this morning’s game in Manchester. Scroll down for video . Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls tackles journalist Rob Merick as they take part in the Labour MP's v Lobby Journalist football match this morning . Merrick was forced off the pitch after the clash and needed patching up before returning to the fray . This morning's game took place at Manchester City's 'Ethiad Campus' in the east of the city . Merrick, a combative central midfield enforcer, later took himself off to accident and emergency. Mr Poll said: ‘Had I been refereeing this match, I would have certainly voted Yes for a straight red card for Ed Balls. ‘As the pictures show, Ed deliberately brought his arm and elbow into the face of Rob Merrick – a clear foul and an obvious sending off. ‘But if you need further evidence, you only need to look at the blood that flowed after the incident. ‘Not only did we have a man representing the red of the Labour Party – his challenge left plenty of red on his opponent’s shirt and that’s why my card definitely would have been red for Ed.’ Mr Balls is said to have lost a stone since last year’s match, though again the photographic evidence appears to do little to support his case. The pair clashed as they battled for the ball in this morning's 'charity game' for breast cancer . Mr Balls clearly caught the lobby journalist with his arm, but later rejected claims that he was at fault . The Northern Echo's political correspondent was forced to leave the pitch for treatment after the clash . After the clash Merrick was taken off the pitch and patched up by the waiting St John's ambulance staff. He returned to the side of the pitch before later getting back into the action. Another journalist Graeme Demianyk, the Western Morning News’s political correspondent, was also forced off the pitch after being injured in a separate clash with Mr Balls. Demianyk, who suffered a 'dead leg' in the incident, said: ‘The shadow chancellor is an uncompromising opponent. When running towards you at full pace, it feels a bit like you’re in the path of that out-of-control boulder in Indiana Jones.’ A spokesman for the journalists' team told MailOnline that there was no bad blood with Mr Balls. He said: 'It was an accident. Ed is very combative player and there was no malice. Mr Balls has been playing in the annual fixture since 1994 . Merrick was taken off the pitch and patched up by the waiting St John's ambulance staff. After the match he took himself to hospital on the bus for treatment . He is known as a combative centre forward, alongside fellow shadow cabinet member Andy Burnham . 'Ed is a bruiser in every respect, that is fair to say. But on this occasion he did not intend to injure Rob.' The spokesman added: 'Rob felt a boom and then suddenly he was bust.' The match ended 3-1 to the journalists. Demianyk of the Western Morning News opened the scoring by bundling home from close range, before the Financial Times's George Parker doubled the advantage. But a strike from political aide Dave Hodges sparked a shaky spell from the Lobby, and it took a goal from Matt Dathan of The Times to settle the issue. It is the second year running the Labour team has been defeated in the conference showdown, which is supported by the Football Association and helps raise funds for charity. After the match Mr Balls said he hoped Merrick had not sustained any lasting damage. ‘I was about to score a brilliant goal in the top right hand corner,’ he said. ‘As I steadied myself to shoot Rob came piling in from behind attempting to nick the ball and came off worst. Afterwards Mr Balls added to BuzzFeed News it was no way a horror tackle and he didn’t see Merrick until it was too late. He said: ‘If he wants to jump on the back from behind then he’ll have to do it a bit more carefully next time. But I do hope he’ll be fine.’ Merrick lifts up the winning trophy for the lobby team, with his injuries from the Shadow Chancellor  clearly evident .

"Ed Miliband will be forced to sack up to one in five of his frontbenchers if he becomes Prime Minister under rules to stop him wasting public money. Shadow ministers are braced for a dramatic cull of those offered ’no-jobs’ in opposition to quell rebellion. The bloodbath will occur even if Mr Miliband wins an overall majority. If he is forced into a coalition, even more Labour MPs will miss out on a ministerial salary. Labour leader Ed Miliband will have to make difficult choices about which of his frontbenchers get paid ministerial jobs, and which are sent to the backbenches . Mr Miliband wants to use this weeks Labour conference in Manchester to show he is in touch with the concerns of normal voters with just eight months until the general election. But privately several of those given frontbench jobs are braced for the chop. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls has also vowed to cut the pay of those who do become ministers by 5 per cent, under efforts to prove he can be trusted with the nation’s finances. Mr Miliband is expected to carry out a reshuffle after the party conference season. However, he is already breaking rules introduced 40 years ago to stop political leaders from packing their frontbenchers with MPs and Peers to increase the party's grip on discipline. Labours own analysis shows it has 138 frontbenchers in the Commons and the Lords. But under the Ministerial and Other Salaries Act passed in 1975, only 109 ministerial salaries can be paid at any one time. It raises the prospect of 29 people - or 21 per cent - who currently think they are heading for a job in government being left bitterly disappointed. Prime Ministers are also banned from having more than 95 ministers in the House of Commons, to ensure those on the government payroll does not dominate Parliament. At the Labour conference in Manchester today, Mr Miliband appeared on stage with senior Labour figures involved in the Scottish referendum campaign, including Jim Murphy, Alistair Darling, Johann Lamont and Douglas Alexander . However the most recent full list of Labour frontbenchers published shows as many as 105 MPs listed with shadow ministerial jobs. ’A whole load of people are going to be disappointed,’ said one Labour frontbencher. ’In opposition it's great handing out these jobs, but the rules are clear and people who have been shadowing departments for years will be left out in the cold. ’It's not a great way to start a new government, is it?’ One solution to the overall cap on paid ministers is a loophole which allows more frontbenchers, as long as they do not get a salary. However, Labour was highly critical of David Cameron’s decision to downgrade the pay and status of the leader of the House of Lords Lady Stowell. A Labour spokesman said: ‘All ministerial posts are in the gift of the prime minister.’ At the Labour conference in Manchester today, Mr Balls used his keynote speech to announce plans to cut ministerial pay. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls used his speech to conference today to promise that if Mr Miliband becomes Prime Minister, he will cut ministerial salaries by 5 per cent . He said Mr Miliband and all of the Shadow Cabinet ‘are clear it will mean cuts and tough decisions and we will take the lead’. Mr Balls added: ‘If we win the election, on day one of the next Labour government, the pay of every government Minister will immediately be cut by five per cent. ‘Ministerial pay will then be frozen each year until we have achieved our promise to balance the nation’s books . ‘Because we are all clear that everybody in the next Labour government will be fully focused on that vital task of getting the deficit down.’","Prime Ministers banned from paying more than 109 ministerial salaries .

"Ed Balls today revealed he has been grilled by his wife Yvette Cooper about his bloody football match clash which left a rival player needing stitches. The shadow chancellor rejected claims from former top referee Graham Poll who said he was lucky not to have been sent off after elbowing Northern Echo reporter Rob Merrick in the face. Miss Cooper, the shadow home secretary, demanded to know 'what went on' after the incident, and joked that it undermines her determination to be 'tough on anti-social behaviour'. Reporter Rob Merrick was sporting a black eye today, after his clash with Ed Balls on Sunday, but during media interviews this morning (right) the shadow chancellor insisted it was not a foul . Mr Balls' wife Yvette Cooper, who was in the audience for his conference speech today, joked that the incident undermined her attempts to be tough on anti-social behaviour . Shadow chancellor Ed Balls tackles journalist Rob Merick as they take part in the Labour MPs v Lobby Journalists football match . Merrick was left with blood pouring down his face, and later needed four stitches at A&E . Mr Balls insisted there were no hard feelings, and he and Mr Merrick remain 'good friends' despite the clash . The nasty clash occurred during the traditional pre-conference football match between Labour and political journalists. The pair were contesting a 50-50 ball on the edge of the Lobby penalty area when a stray elbow from Mr Balls left a slash under the reporter's right eye. Mr Merrick had to leave the pitch for medical treatment as blood covered his shirt - but later returned to be named man-of-the-match. Challenged about the incident today, Mr Balls admitted his wife had demanded an explanation: 'Yvette saw those pictures and said 'what went on'?' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Mr Balls added: 'It was a clash, a coming together. It was n malice. It wasn't even a foul. We didn't even know it had happened. 'The referee not only said it wasn't a foul, but everybody else knew it wasn't a foul. It was a complete accident. 'Rob and I, we're good friends, there's not hard feeling between us. But I have to say to you it's not a good picture.' However, former top referee Graham Poll insisted he should have been sent off. 'Had I been refereeing this match, I would have certainly voted Yes for a straight red card for Ed Balls. ‘As the pictures show, Ed deliberately brought his arm and elbow into the face of Rob Merrick – a clear foul and an obvious sending off. ‘But if you need further evidence, you only need to look at the blood that flowed after the incident. ‘Not only did we have a man representing the red of the Labour Party – his challenge left plenty of red on his opponent’s shirt and that’s why my card definitely would have been red for Ed.’ Mr Balls tried to present a softer image this morning with a visit to a nursery in Manchester . He was joined by shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves at Asbury Meadow SureStart centre . Mr Balls hopes to use his Labour conference speech today to prove to voters that he can be trusted with the economy . Photographs of the elbowing have been circulated online and appeared on the front pages of several newspapers today. Miss Cooper, who is in charge of Labour's policy on law and order, suggested the violence could be a setback for the party's stance against thuggery. She told a Labour List conference rally: 'Some of you may have seen the photographs of Ed and his encounter on a football match earlier. 'When he came back he said, 'well, there was a bit of an incident - a journalist ran into my arm. Well, all right, so he ran into my elbow ...with his eye'.' She told the audience: 'So when you see the photographs of all the blood and the grimaces… it does rather undermine my determination to be tough on anti-social behaviour.' The Labour team - which featured a host of frontbench stalwarts including Andy Burnham, Jim Murphy and Sadiq Khan - eventually suffered the pain of a 3-1 defeat. Graeme Demianyk of the Western Morning News opened the scoring by bundling home from close range, before the Financial Times's George Parker doubled the advantage.

"Ed Miliband refused 13 times yesterday to back David Cameron’s proposal for ‘home rule’ for England. As the fallout from Scotland’s independence referendum threatened to engulf both main political parties, the Labour leader repeatedly declined to agree that Scottish MPs should be barred from voting on laws that only affect England. He warned that the move would create two classes of MP – and suggested it could ‘drive our country apart’. However, there has been a backlash among his own MPs, many of whom warn that the party could be seen as ‘anti-English’ unless it supports reform that gives the country the same rights promised to Scotland. Scroll down for video . Labour leader Ed Miliband said blocking Scottish MPs from voting on English issues would create two classes of MPs . Mr Miliband accused David Cameron of using the Scottish referendum to play politics against the Labour party . Former Labour welfare minister Frank Field, writing in today’s Mail, says the idea of Scottish MPs continuing to vote on health, welfare, taxation and other matters ceded to the Scottish Parliament is ‘dead in the water’. He claims he went to see Mr Miliband as far back as 2010 and warned him about ‘the English question’ – but was ignored. And Labour MP Kate Hoey said preventing Scottish MPs from voting on issues that affect only England was ‘the right thing to do’. The Prime Minister will hold a ‘council of war’ at Chequers on Monday with more than 20 senior Conservatives. Downing Street, which yesterday insisted Mr Cameron will deliver on his pledge to devolve further powers to the Scottish Parliament come what may, is seeking to head off a Tory revolt over the last-ditch promises made to the Scots to help win last week’s No vote on independence. Barring Scottish MPs from voting on key affairs would permanently cripple Labour’s power base at Westminster because of the party’s heavy reliance on the support of its 41 MPs north of the border. Mr Miliband and his wife Justine were both in Manchester for a fringe meeting at the Labour Party conference . Labour has 41 MPs in Scotland which could help it form a majority at next year's General Election . At the last election, the Conservatives won 296 of 533 seats in England – and would have had an overall majority of 59 if Scottish MPs were excluded. Yesterday, as the row overshadowed the opening of the Labour party conference in Manchester, Mr Miliband was asked 13 times by the BBC’s Andrew Marr whether he backed the idea of ‘English votes for English laws’, but refused to give a direct answer. Under pressure, he suggested he might be open to a system of allowing English MPs greater ‘scrutiny’ of new laws that only affect England. But he said that should be considered by a ‘constitutional convention’ that would begin next year after a Labour election victory. ‘I am in favour of one House of Commons with 650 MPs because, goodness, we fought tooth and nail over the last two years to avoid our Parliament being split up and our United Kingdom being split up and I want to make sure that doesn’t happen,’ he said. ‘I’m not against the idea of greater scrutiny of legislation that particularly affects England by English MPs. ‘But we can’t do it in a back-of-the-envelope, fag packet way. Let’s not drive our country apart because David Cameron believes it is an opportunity for him to do it.’ Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps told Sky News that Mr Cameron’s idea was ‘common sense’. However, former Labour deputy prime minister Lord Prescott described the plan as a ‘Tory trick’ designed to ‘fix’ Westminster in the party’s favour. A Survation poll for the Mail on Sunday found that two in three English voters believe MPs representing Scottish seats at Westminster should be banned from voting on issues such as health and education. Just one in five oppose the move. David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg made 'a vow' to the Scottish people to transfer new powers to Edinburgh . EVASION ONE . Andrew Marr: It seems fairly clear that you have been put into a trap – either you agree with the Prime Minister and support English votes for English laws ... or you will be part of leaders getting together and fumbling it and reneging on the pact you’ve given to the Scottish people. How do you get out of that trap? Ed Miliband: Well I want to come to the detail of that in a minute, but I want to make a broader point, which is a very, very important point for the future of our country. I think there is a huge danger that the political class is learning the wrong lessons from this referendum. Marr: So David Cameron has connected that promise to English votes for English laws and a huge number of people in England say yes that is fair, it is absolutely fair; why should Scottish MPs be able to vote on taxes in England if English MPs aren’t able to vote on taxes in Scotland? They’re right about that, aren’t they? EVASION TWO . Miliband: Well let’s be very clear about what David Cameron has done. He will have to speak for himself in the coming days. But what William Hague said very, very clearly on the radio on Friday morning was that these two processes, they wanted them to run in parallel. Marr: In a principled way, what is wrong with English votes for English laws? It’s fair, isn’t it, it’s fair play? EVASION THREE . Miliband: Well I think that we’ve got to look at all of the constitutional issues that have been thrown up. Marr: But I’m asking a very specific question here. EVASION FOUR . Miliband: I know and I’m going to come to it. Let me explain. Look I think there is a big problem, which is that power has been devolved in Scotland, power has been devolved in Wales, but governments of both parties have failed to devolve power in England. Now the first answer to that question is not to change the nature of the centralised power of Westminster over England. It is to devolve power in England and that is absolute. Marr: But England is a country. England is a nation herself... Miliband: Absolutely, absolutely. Marr: And there is no reason, in fairness, why Scottish MPs should be able to vote on English laws if it can’t happen the other way around. EVASION FIVE . Miliband: Absolutely. And we... Marr: I want to keep on this very, very important principled question. EVASION SIX . Miliband:  ...and we’ve got to look at all of these issues. Marr: Would you accept English votes for English laws, as it’s called, or not? EVASION SEVEN . Miliband: We’ll look ... at any proposals come forward with. Let me just say... Marr: It’s a very straightforward question. EVASION EIGHT . Miliband: Well and I’m going to ... I’m going to explain. And I tell you what, there isn’t a simple answer to this question. Marr: Yes there is. Miliband: No there isn’t. Marr: I’m sorry, yes or no? It’s very straightforward. EVASION NINE . Miliband: No, there isn’t a simple answer. Let me explain why. We’ve been wrestling with this issue for 120 years, ever since we were talking about Irish home rule around a century ago. Now what is the issue? When you devolve power to some parts of the country in different ways to others, it throws up these questions. So, for example, let me give you another example. London MPs vote on transport issues outside London, but English MPs outside London don’t vote on transport issues in London, because they’re devolved... Marr: That’s inside a country. I’m just asking again . . . the principled case against an English Parliament. Miliband: Well hang on a minute, we are a country, we are a United Kingdom. Now the way I ... What I say about this is I am open to the idea of greater scrutiny of legislation by English MPs. Marr: This ... I’m sorry to cut in, but the truth is that you’re against English votes for English laws because Labour wouldn’t dominate. Surely the answer to that is for Labour to do better in England ... not to refuse English people this basic justice? EVASION TEN . Miliband: I’ve got to say to you, that’s not the history. I mean, look, the history is that when Labour has won majorities across the United Kingdom, we’ve won majorities in England too. I think it’s about this. I think it’s about the fact that we don’t play fast and loose with our constitution, we do change in the right way. Marr: So I return again. Is there a principled case against, in effect, an English Parliament, or not? EVASION ELEVEN . Miliband: Well I’m not in favour of a new parliament and a new tier of politicians. I don’t think that’s the answer, I’ve got to say to you. And I am in favour of one House of Commons with 650 MPs because, goodness, we fought tooth and nail over the last two years to avoid our parliament being split up and our United Kingdom being split up. Marr: You’re using the word ‘scrutiny’. I’m wondering about votes really. EVASION TWELVE . Miliband: Well, let me make this point. Well, there are two points to this. First of all, in practice the reality is it’s very hard to separate out legislation. Take tuition fees in England, right. You might say that’s an English-only issue. It has knock-on effects for Scotland as well in terms of public spending. Is that an English-only issue or a more universally applying issue? Secondly, I’m not in favour of a House of Commons that becomes divided. Marr: But ... then you carry on with the injustice of Scottish MPs. EVASION THIRTEEN . Miliband: No, no. No you look at it ... No, because you look at this issue in a calm, measured, correct way through a process, through a constitutional convention. I mean, goodness, we’ve been wrestling with this issue for 100 years. Of course we should take our time and look at this properly.","Ed Miliband says he is open to English-only 'scrutiny' of law but not vetoes .

"Millions of workers in councils, schools and hospitals would be asked what their parents did for a living if Labour wins the next election. Equalities spokesman Gloria De Piero said too many careers were dominated by middle class and private school-educated people. She said that, starting with the public sector, the first step to increase social mobility would be to force employers to keep records on the social backgrounds of their staff to prove they were not all from privileged sections of society. Scroll down for video . Showstopper: In a sleeveless two-tone shift dress and strappy wedge heels former GMTV presenter Gloria De Piero gesticulated passionately during her speech to the Labour party conference in Manchester . This would involve asking questions about their parents' occupations to assess whether they were working class. But critics immediately dismissed the plan as an expensive, bureaucratic gimmick. Miss De Piero, 41, grew up in a working-class area of Bradford. She became MP for Ashfield in Nottinghamshire in 2010 after a career as a GMTV presenter, and within three and a half years was shadow minister for women and equalities. Addressing Labour's annual conference, she said: 'We talk a lot about smashing glass ceilings, and rightly so. But the Labour Party will never forget about the people who can't even get through the door of the building. Miss De Piero, 41, grew up in a working-class area of Bradford and became MP for Ashfield in Nottinghamshire in 2010 . Shadow education secretary Trristram Hunt MP kisses Miss De Piero after his speech . 'Because if you're born poor, you are more likely to stay poor in this country than in other wealthy nations. 'There are ladders that can be used to climb up and get on but they aren't being extended to everyone. Good companies already monitor the race, gender and disability of their staff. They should monitor social background for the same reason. A Labour government will work to ensure this is done in the public sector.' She said this had been implemented for the first time by the civil service's 'fast stream', which parachutes graduates into top jobs in Whitehall. When it surveyed its intake, just 25 out of 654 graduates were working-class, she said. 'It makes me angry,' she told delegates. 'Talent is class-blind, but Britain is still not. The civil service should set the standard on open recruitment and open opportunity.' Staff would not be questioned about their background when they were applying for a job. Instead, employees would be asked voluntary questions about their parents' occupations. A rising Labour star has advised his colleagues to stop talking in 'political soundbites' if they want to win votes. Shadow justice minister Dan Jarvis, a former Army officer, also insisted his party must go 'toe-to-toe' with Ukip, having taken too many supporters in Labour's northern heartlands for granted. 'The public are so fed up, so cynical with politicians – we have got a huge challenge to address that,' he told the Guardian. 'We have got to convince people we are on their side ... I know the public just stop listening when we speak in a language of the Westminster village that is about a clipped political soundbite.' Tory MP Andrew Bridgen, who grew up in a working-class home and became a millionaire, said the plan was a gimmick designed to 'appease the lentil-munching Guardianistas in the Labour Party'. He added: 'It would create more costly bureaucracy for public bodies, and would quickly be extended to businesses where it would harm services and job creation. People should be encouraged to aspire to fulfil their potential through hard work, talent and opportunity.' Monitoring employees' backgrounds was a key recommendation in a report by Alan Milburn, the former Labour minister who advises the Coalition on social mobility. Parts of the civil service monitor levels of working-class staff using an Office for National Statistics definition that identifies their parents as having routine jobs in the sales, service, production, technical and agricultural sectors. City law firms have monitored the backgrounds of staff since 2011 after they were found to be among the least socially-diverse employers. A spokesman for Miss De Piero said: 'The public sector already asks about the ethnicity, gender and disability status of employees. Social background would just be another question. It will help expose which parts of society still operate as a closed shop.' Ed's £8 minimum wage a 'threat to jobs' Ed Miliband's plan to raise the minimum wage to please 'Burger King Britain' will cost jobs and squeeze the better off, Labour was warned last night. Kicking off his party's annual conference yesterday, Mr Miliband unveiled eye-catching proposals to force employers to pay staff at least £8 an hour. He said he had been inspired to bring in the increase after meeting a low-paid worker at the Burger King fast food chain. The most junior members of staff there get the current minimum of up to £6.31 an hour, according to job adverts. The rate, which applies to about 1.4million workers, will increase to £6.50 an hour from next month and business leaders warned that is the highest it can be without putting jobs at risk. Steve Hughes, head of economics at the Policy Exchange think-tank, said: 'Major hikes in the national minimum wage could actually lead to slower pay increases for those slightly up the pay scale, who still struggle on relatively low incomes.' Mr Miliband's announcement would see the minimum wage raised in annual stages to at least £8 an hour by 2020, adding around £3,000 a year to salaries of those working 40 hours a week. This would save the taxpayer 'hundreds of millions of pounds' in welfare payments, the Labour leader said. He rejected suggestions that an above-inflation rise in the minimum wage would be unaffordable for the public sector, which is one of the biggest employers of low-paid staff, and would cost jobs. 'What is happening at the moment is that we are spending billions of pounds subsidising employers who are paying low wages, billions of pounds in benefits, tax credits and housing benefit,' Mr Miliband told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show. John Allan, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: 'Our concern is that setting rates according to political need means that the impact of rises on employment, inflation and growth will not be fully explored. Sectors such as retail and social care are run on very fine margins, and will struggle with substantial increases to the minimum wage rate that fail to take wider economic conditions into account.' But TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: 'Raising the minimum wage and putting more money into the hands of low-paid workers won't just be welcomed by hard-pressed families, it will also be good news for local economies who will benefit from a boost in workers' spending power.'","Labour MP Gloria De Piero said careers were dominated by middle class .

"A California gym member has been charged with murder for allegedly bludgeoning a man to death with a weightlifting bar for flirting with his girlfriend. Prosecutors say Kenneth Osako, 46, struck 43-year-old David Galindo on the head with a heavy piece of gym equipment at a Bally Total Fitness in South San Francisco last Wednesday. Days earlier, Galindo had asked Osako's girlfriend whether she wanted a ride on his motorcycle, according to investigators. Savage attack: Kenneth Osako, 46 (left), has been charged with murder for allegedly striking fellow gym member David Galindo, 43 (right) with a weightlifting bar in the back of the head . Crime scene: The fatal altercation took place in this Bally Total Fitness gym on El Camino Real in San Francisco last Wednesday night . San Mateo County District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe says police are still trying to determine whether the off-hand remark was the motive for the September 17 attack. Galindo suffered multiple blows to the head and later died from his injuries at San Francisco General Hospital. Osako appeared in court Monday on a murder charge. He declined a public defender and was then taken back into custody without bail. He is due back in court September 29 for his initial arraignment. According to published reports, the two men were working out at the gym on El Camino Real at around 9.30pm last Wednesday when Osako picked up an 18-inch steel bar used for tricep dips and smashed Galindo in the back of the head several times. The 46-year-old then dropped the bar and left the scene, but was apprehended the following day. Kenneth Osako’s girlfriend, who has not been named, told police during an interview that two days before the incident, she was approached by David Galindo who invited her to take a ride on his bike. The woman said she declined the offer, but told Osako about her exchange with Galindo Tuesday night, San Mateo County Times reported. According to officials, the suspect’s girlfriend was not present at the gym last Wednesday and played no part in the attack. She continues to cooperate with the investigation. Daughter speaks: Kealani Osako (left), one of Kenneth Osako's five daughters, said her father is known for his hot temper, possibly caused by an diagnosed and untreated bi-polar disorder . Osako, a father of five, worked as a plumber in San Francisco.

Ms Osako went on to say she believed her hot-tempered father suffers from a bi-polar disorder, but he has never been diagnosed. ‘I've seen my dad get overtaken by anger before,’ she told ABC 7 News. ‘So I can just picture him being so angry.’ Ms Osako added that her father took exercise very seriously, and whenever he went to the gym he would ‘zone out,’ making it the worst possible time for anyone to anger him. Kealani, a student at University of California at Santa Barbara, apologized to the victim’s family, inviting them to reach out to her in the hope of giving them some ‘peace of mind.’ ‘I know he's sorry and I know he didn't want this to happen.

"London could be plunged into riots again unless train and bus fares come down, the capital’s transport commissioner has said. Sir Peter Hendy, head of Transport for London, said the city’s networks will face ‘overwhelming’ overcrowding by 2030 unless new rail lines are urgently built. This could cause ‘social unrest’ and the sort of ‘trouble’ seen in Mumbai, where there have been protests over fare increases. London could be plunged into riots again unless train and bus fares come down, Sir Peter Hendy, head of Transport for London has said . Billions of pounds are already been invested in London’s transport networks, but Sir Peter said a rapidly expanding population will put intolerable pressure on public transport. He said an additional six million trips will be made in the capital each day by the end of the next decade. Sir Peter, who is paid more than £300,000 a year, told The Guardian that low-paid workers now lived on the outskirts of the capital rather than in inner-city neighbourhoods - and there could be ‘social unrest’ if they could not easily commute around the city for work. ‘London’s poor don’t live in Harrow Road, they live in Enfield and Tolworth and if you can’t get them to jobs they want, your city’s going to be in a bad way: it’s not going to progress and contribute to national economic growth,’ Sir Peter said. ‘The stakes are pretty high. If you’re not able to increase transport capacity, and people find accessing work impossible, you risk social unrest. You can expect trouble.’ Sir Peter said that low-paid workers now lived on the outskirts of the capital rather than in inner-city neighbourhoods - and there could be ‘social unrest’ if they could not easily commute around the city for work . Bus fares have risen by more than 50 per cent in six years under the London mayor, Boris Johnson – a policy Sir Peter has backed. But the transport commissioner warned fares could not continue to rise. London’s population is officially estimated at 8.4million and is rising by about 80,000 people a year. It is expected to reach 10 million by 2030. ‘If you contemplate a London in 2030 without continuous investment and more revenue money, we will have the kind of congestion you’re looking at in Mumbai,’ he said. Mumbai was one of several Indian cities that experienced protests over rail fare increases earlier this year, while more than a year of escalating demonstrations in Brazilian cities in the runup to the 2014 World Cup were ignited by fare rises on public transport.","Sir Peter Hendy, head of Transport for London, said London could be plunged into riots again unless train and bus fares come down .

"Mauricio Pochettino is getting tough with his under-performing Tottenham squad and insists that player reputations mean nothing to him. The Spurs manager won his first four matches in charge at the club, after taking over in the summer, but has since lost two and drawn two. They now face a tricky tie against Nottingham Forest on Wednesday night in the Capital One Cup to turn that form around, where places for Saturday's north London derby against Arsenal are up for grabs. Mauricio Pochettino passes on instructions to his Tottenham side during the home defeat against Liverpool . Pochettino expresses his frustration during Tottenham's defeat to West Brom on Sunday . One of the difficulties the former Southampton boss faces is utilising a squad largely assembled under Andre Villas-Boas, in a period when chairman Daniel Levy sanctioned more than £100million worth of transfers after Gareth Bale moved to Real Madrid for a world record fee. Some of the larger deals included signing Roberto Soldado from Valencia for £26million Erik Lamela from Roma for £25.7million and Paulinho from Corinthians at a cost of £17million. But when asked if reputations meant anything to him, Pochettino replied: 'No, I select the team, but they, the players, show me. They are not different. We have 25 or 26 players and they are all in the squad. If I decide you play, you play, but the name is nothing for me when I pick my team.' Their recent poor form was particularly apparent in the shock slump at home to West Bromwich Albion on Sunday, when they lost 1-0 to a side bottom of the league. Pochettino revealed that he has been 'straight' with his players that the performance, in which they had 63 per cent possession but only one shot on target, was not acceptable. 'To build a winning mentality and a winning team, sometimes you need to lose, you need a big hit in your face to change sometimes the energy and realise that you need to fight every game,' Pochettino added, displaying an adept understanding of metaphor despite his, at times, patchy English. James Morrison scored the only goal of the game on Sunday as West Brom condemned Tottenham to defeat . The Tottenham manager celebrates their last-gasp winner at Upton Park on the opening day of the season . 'You need to fight every training session, you need to play like a team and you need to show more energy like a team in the competition.' The Forest match is the players' last chance to impress upon Pochettino that they deserve a place in the side for the derby match at the weekend. And the Argentine has no problem with dropping those who he feels are not playing to the standard he expects, regardless of their price tag. He added: 'We analyse every game and every performance and after we decide. For me, when I pick the best players for playing in each game, always I analyse how was the last performance. 'And I have no problem to pick different players in different competitions or if it's not in a good moment, if you need to change, you change. It's not a big problem.'","Mauricio Pochettino expects his under-performing Tottenham squad to raise their game after a poor run of form .

"West Brom are on the trail of Rayo Vallecano striker Alberto Bueno. The 26-year-old is out of contract next summer and could be available for a knock-down price in January.

Rayo Vallecano's Alberto Bueno is being tracked West Bromwich Albion as they look to bolster their attack .

"West Ham new-boy Diafra Sakho has made an instant impact at Upton Park, scoring three goals in four games, for the Hammers. Here Sportsmail takes a look at Upton Park's current hero. There wasn't a big song and dance about him signing was there? No, he slipped under the radar somewhat. He arrived from Metz for just £3.5million. If he carries on the way he'll prove one of the bargains of the season. Diafra Sakho celebrates after scoring his third goal of the season in West Ham's 3-1 win over Liverpool . What are his attributes? Certainly his pace. The forward's rapidness caused Liverpool's defence major problems on Saturday and West Ham's rivals can expect more of the same. His versatility and directness will be key for the Hammers, with the Senegal international able to play anywhere across the forward line. Did he have any other summer suitors? Newcastle, with their strong knowledge of French football, were interested in the Sakho, but Sam Allardyce beat his former club to the punch. Sakho competes with his namesake Mamadou during the Premier League clash at Upton Park . The deal nearly fell through, however, when the Hammers tried to change the structure of the deal, forcing Metz to release this strongly worded statement: . 'The English club unilaterally decided to propose a loan deal with an option to purchase instead of a permanent deal, which does not correspond to FC Metz's expectations and contradicts all the terms that had been agreed last week between the two clubs. 'FC Metz regret this clear lack of respect, which is unacceptable, from West Ham towards FC Metz and also the player. As a result, FC Metz reserve the right to approach the international sport court and assert their rights and defender their interests. Sakho's goal against Liverpool came from a beautifully floated cross-shot into the corner . 'FC Metz had released Diafra Sakho from his professional duties during matchday 1 of the Ligue 1 championship by giving him leave to take a medical in England to complete the last stage of the deal.' Three in four is a good return, what's his goal record like? Not bad, he's scored 40 goals for Metz in his previous two seasons. They were all out of the French top-flight, though.","Diafra Sakho scored in West Ham's 3-1 win over Liverpool at Upton Park .

"Cardiff's awful start to the campaign took another terrible turn after an embarrassing 3-0 home defeat to Bournemouth to exit the Capital One Cup. The managerless pre-season promotion favourites, who have won just two Championship games and sit in 17th, were second best throughout the 90 minutes and were lucky not to have lost by a heavier margin. Dan Gosling scored either side of Charlie Daniels' left-footed drive within 35 minutes as the Cherries picked off the hapless home side at will. Gosling could have had a hat-trick had it not been for an offside flag while Harry Arter thundered a late effort off the crossbar. Dan Gosling gives Bournemouth the lead against Cardiff . Former Newcastle midfielder Dan Gosling celebrates with his Bournemouth team-mates . It was a tough day at the office for joint caretaker boss Scott Young . What began as a dream evening for Danny Gabbidon quickly turned into the stuff of nightmares for the joint-caretaker boss. With Scott Young prowling the touchline, Gabbidon named himself in what could turn out to be the pair's only team sheet on home soil as Cardiff managers. In doing so, the centre-back gave himself a second Bluebirds debut having returned to his cherished boyhood club last month. His inclusion was one of eight changes to the starting line-up but there was no place for Tuesday afternoon's loan signing Ravel Morrison, cup-tied having appeared in this competition for West Ham. But right from the first whistle there was scant sense this would be the morale-boosting victory that the majority of the sparse 6,000 crowd craved. Brett Pitman fired a warning sign at Simon Moore after just eight minutes and seconds later the game's first goal arrived as Gosling was allowed space to bend a low right-footed shot into the bottom corner. Cardiff joint caretaker boss Danny Gabbidon couldn't turn things around on the pitch . Charlie Daniels' clinical strike doubled Bournemouth's advantage . Charlie Daniels celebrates doubling the Cherries' advantage . Dan Gosling is delighted after making it 3-0 to Bournemouth . Bournemouth's classy midfielders were dictating the game and it was no surprise when they cut open the Cardiff rearguard with ease again in the 22nd minute when Eunan O'Kane's defence-splitting through-ball was lashed into the far corner by Daniels. Only an offside flag then stopped Gabbidon's first start of 2014/15 hitting a new low. The 35-year-old was caught in possession on the edge of his own box and was a relieved man to see Pitman flagged as he went to roll in Gosling for a third. Former Everton man Gosling would only have to wait eight minutes for his second goal of the evening, the midfielder firing through a crowd of red shirts after Moore could only push Pitman's curling effort into his path. That was enough for Young who hauled off Kim Bo-kyung and Javi Guerra with just 36 minutes on the clock and their withdrawals did have a impact before the home side were booed off the pitch. Federico Macheda blazed over the bar after Nicky Maynard's shot was well saved by Bournemouth's Southampton loanee Artur Boruc and the Pole then pulled off a stunning save to claw out Tom Adeyemi's hooked effort on the stroke of half-time. Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe applauds the visiting fans . Junior Stanislas of Bournemouth and Cardiff's Juan Cala get stuck in . Macheda's clever finish six minutes after the break, after Declan John's fine cross, was ruled out for offside and that was as close as Cardiff came. With 10 minutes to go Bournemouth were only a lick of paint away from another. Arter, scorer of a memorable long-range effort on Saturday, almost grabbed his second stunning strike in four days only for his fizzing effort to bounce back off the underside of the crossbar. A minute later Cardiff needed Gabbidon to clear two efforts off his own line to deny Bournemouth, in what was certainly not the end to the evening the caretaker boss would have envisaged.","Mangerless Cardiff 3-0 down within 33 minutes .

"You would probably win a couple of pints in a pub trivia bet if you asked: ‘Who is Julen Lopetegui?’ and ‘Which current Champions League team scored their fewest points in 20 years last season?’ And it’s a value-for-money poser because the answers centre on just one club: Porto. Their ‘season horribilis’ in 2013/14 included: sacking Paulo Fonseca in March and replacing him with reserve-team manager Luis Castro, failing to get out of their Champions League group, losing a five-and-a-half-year unbeaten home record, recording their lowest total since three points for a win was introduced and ending up 13 behind title-winners and hated rivals Benfica, who also knocked them out of both domestic cups at the semi-final stage. Julen Lopetegui's Porto have got off to a fine start to the season by winning three of their four league games . Lopetegui succeeded caretaker manager Luis Castro after Paulo Fonseca resigned from the post . Jose Mourinho made a name for himself at Porto before moving across Europe to Chelsea in 2004 . Lopetegui, now in charge at the Dragon Stadium, was a journeyman footballer — one appearance for Real Madrid, one for the Spanish national team and a handful of horrible memories at Barcelona. In the mid-1990s, if you’d tried to sell lucky white heather to the current Porto boss he’d either have punched your lights out, or bitten your hand off. He played nine times in a strong Barcelona era, winning just once. Worse, he was in goal for the 1994 Supercup final second-leg 5-4 defeat to Real Zaragoza in front of 70,000 dismayed Catalans at the Nou Camp and was sent off. Two years later, he was between the sticks for Sir Bobby Robson’s Barcelona when they lost the Supercup final second-leg 3-1 to Atletico. The low point came in the home leg of a Spanish Cup last-16 tie against Atletico when he was sent off at the Camp Nou after 13 minutes. Barcelona lost 4-1 and Lopetegui cried on the way to the dressing room. He had some days of wine and roses, happy times with Logrones and selection for Spain’s 1994 World Cup squad, plus European football for Rayo Vallecano. Lopetegui played in goal for Sir Bobby Robson's Barcelona during his playing days as a goalkeeper . But, as with Arsene Wenger, Arrigo Sacchi and Jose Mourinho, neither a lack of playing experience nor a moderate career was a barrier to significant coaching success. Already Lopetegui has coached some of Spain’s continuing golden generation to win the UEFA European Championship at both Under-21 and Under-19 level. Now he’s the boss of the 2004 Champions League and 2011 Europa League winners. Ahead of Sunday's Oporto derby against Boavista, Porto sit joint-top of the Portuguese league and lead Champions League Group H after their 6-0 hammering of BATE Borisov. More intriguingly, the 48-year-old Spaniard is working with the youngest average-aged squad in Champions League history (just over 22-years-old) and needs to accommodate the signing of 14 new players over the summer — seven of whom are Spanish. With his technical staff, it means that at this proud Portuguese club there are now 12 Spaniards driving its progress. If results go awry, no question who will be first to be blamed. ‘Football is universal! I’ll ensure that there are no “nationalities” here — just good, well-taught, committed footballers all treated the same,’ Lopetegui says. The midweek win indicates he has a gem in Yacine Brahimi, who scored a glorious hat-trick in his first ever Champions League match, having been signed from Granada. The French-Algerian is a player to make your ticket price seem like good value. But there are more sparklers. Porto forward Yacine Brahimi, pictured celebrating his goal against Bate Borisov, is one to watch . Ruben Neves is a 17-year-old Portuguese star in the making. As is 19-year-old Spaniard Oliver Torres, on loan from Atletico since Lopetegui was his coach with the Spain youth teams. Right now, nothing is more imperative than establishing city dominance. Boavista have struggled this season but theirs is an upwards trajectory, having been down in the third tier because of financial problems. Back at the top table, Porto want to make clear who is master and who is servant. There is a treat in store for the Spanish coach. Born in the Basque Country, his Champions League group games will take him back to the new San Mames to play Athletic Bilbao. ‘(Manager) Ernesto Valverde’s work absolutely stands out there,’ says Lopetegui. ‘They deserved to qualify for this competition and going “home” to play that marvellous team in their new stadium, in front of truly great fans, is a treat.’ No need for lucky white heather now.","Porto have won three of their first four league matches .

"It is not the usual route for adverts making a statement about drink driving, but this Budweiser commercial has been already been viewed more than seven million times on YouTube. Featuring the bond between a young man and his adorable labrador, the advert focuses on worried loved ones when someone doesn't make it home from a night out. Entitled 'Friends Are Waiting', the commercial features a montage showing the bond between man and dog, before showing him leaving the house with a pack of beer and the words: 'I'll see you later buddy'. The tone changes from the happy scenes of the pair jumping into lakes and going for walks to a despondent pet looking out the window and waiting for his master. The words on the screen read: 'For some the waiting never ended. But we can change that.' The footage then cuts to the dog owner opening the door the next morning and being warmly welcomed by his pet dog. He says: 'I'm sorry, I decided I shouldn't drive home last night, I stayed at Dave's.' The caption at the end of the Budweiser advert reads: 'Next time you go out, be sure to make a plan to get home safely. Your friends are counting on you.'

"It's widely thought that Spanish referees are quicker than their English counterparts to point to the spot - and Real Madrid's Marcelo did nothing to dispel that myth with this shocking dive. The European champions got off to a less than ideal start after Edu Albacar gave the visitors the lead at the Bernabeu from the penalty spot. But after Gareth Bale had equalised for Madrid, Marcelo took matters into his own hands by chucking himself on the floor under no challenge from Pedro Mosquera. Marcelo dives over Pedro Mosquera's leg to win a highly dubious penalty for Real Madrid . Referee Carlos Clos Gomez somehow judged the 'contact' to be worthy of a penalty . Referee Carlos Clos Gómez amazingly pointed to the spot, and Cristiano Ronaldo did the honours to give Madrid the lead. Ronaldo doubled his tally shortly afterwards to make it 3-1. But the Portuguese legend wasn't finished there, bagging another two goals to complete an incredible four-goal haul. Marcelo in action for Real Madrid against Elche .

"Heather Watson made a first-round exit at the Dongfeng Motor Wuhan Open after losing in straight sets to Sara Errani. The British No 1 only avoided going through qualifying due to Li Na's retirement from tennis and subsequent withdrawal from her home-town tournament but could not make the most of her opportunity. Watson struggled on serve, only managing to get 46 per cent of her first serves in, and was broken six times as she went down 7-5 6-4 to the 11th seed. Heather Watson (above) was beaten in straights sets by Sara Errani at the Dongfeng Motor Wuhan Open . Speaking after her exit, Watson said: 'Today didn't go how I wanted it to, I played well in patches but didn't keep it up consistently throughout, it was a very up and down match. 'Sara made a lot of balls, she moves well and she stuck in the match the whole way through. That's what won it for her in the end. 'I'm getting back in the gym now ready for next week and the doubles.'","Heather Watson beaten 7-5, 6-4 by Sara Errani .

"It took a piece of quick thinking from Nicky Law to provide the edge as Rangers clinically avoided Ally McCoist’s fears of another stumble on a plastic pitch. Days after a dismal draw on the synthetic surface at part-time Alloa, the Ibrox midfielder grabbed the initiative when he bypassed the 3G pitch at Falkirk which McCoist so dislikes to signpost a route into the quarter-finals of the League Cup for the Glasgow giants. With Rangers struggling on the deck, Law cleverly lofted a headed through-ball over Falkirk’s shaky backline, allowing Dean Shiels — who had missed two fine earlier chances — to fire a high shot beyond Jamie MacDonald and give McCoist’s men a foot in Wednesday's last-eight draw. Ian Black is lifted up by team-mate Darren McGregor after giving Rangers a 3-1 over Falkirk . Rangers' Dean Shiels celebrates his goal with David Templeton . Ian Black duly made sure both feet were planted in the quarter- finals with a scintillating 25-yarder high into the top corner in the dying seconds. It was the kind of strike worthy of winning any game. The goals made for a just result against a Falkirk side which had started like a train, scoring in five minutes through Rory Loy, before conceding just three minutes later via an own goal by Owain Tudur Jones. McCoist had made two changes from the side that started at Alloa on Saturday. Injured duo Lewis Macleod and Nicky Clark, who both scored in a stuffy 2-0 win for Rangers in the Championship at Falkirk last month, were replaced by Lee Wallace and Shiels. And, in what started as a high-octane first half at Westfield, the Northern Irishman could have had his side ahead within 60 seconds. A long ball deceived Will Vaulks and Liam Dick and Shiels ran clear on goal, only to be thwarted by a brave diving save by MacDonald. Ally McCoist cajoles his Rangers troops from the touchline at Falkirk . Things started so brightly for the home side as Rory Loy gave them an early lead . Loy wheeled away to celebrate with the Falkirk fans after drawing first blood . Dean Shiels celebrates his crucial goal for Rangers . The Northern Irish striker hammered the ball home confidently to down Falkirk . Dean Shiels shot flies past Falkirk goalkeeper Jamie MacDonald . Falkirk had not scored a goal in four games in the competition since knocking Rangers out of the 2011 League Cup 3-2 here at Westfield. But in a match watched by scouts from Swansea, Sheffield Wednesday, Birmingham City and Southampton, the Bairns soon put that right when Craig Sibbald fed Tom Taiwo who in turn teed up Blair Alston on the right edge of the box. The Falkirk midfielder’s strong shot was poorly parried by Rangers keeper Steve Simonsen into the path of the predatory Loy. And the former Ibrox trainee made no mistake, ramming the ball gleefully into the net from six yards. Could the home side build on their lead — or at least hold on to it for long enough to build a foundation in the game? The answer was quick in coming when Stevie Smith sent in a terrific delivery from the left and the ball was diverted high past MacDonald and into his own net by the hapless Tudur Jones. It was chance-a-minute stuff by this stage and when Rangers again streaked clear beyond the Falkirk defence, Kris Boyd cleverly fed Shiels. This time, however, his shot was saved terrifically by MacDonald and his follow-up effort was blocked in an extravagant fashion by David McCracken’s backheel. Rangers' youngster Ryan Hardie made his debut for the club in the League Cup tie . Falkirk's David McCracken and Rangers opponent Bilel Moshni go to ground tussling for the ball . Falkirk's Luke Leahy gets up close and personal with Rangers goalscorer Dean Shiels . When Black saw a fine 25-yarder skid narrowly wide of MacDonald’s post it allowed everyone in the 5,259 crowd to regain their breath. They were being treated to a fine contest and next to threaten was Taiwo, who took a pass from Joe Shaughnessy before sending a 20-yard curler a fraction wide of hitting the top left corner of the Rangers net. Sadly, the rest of the first-half petered out, without the goal action that had marked the opening exchanges. And early in the second period, no doubt frustrated by his side’s failure to create further chances, McCoist sent on David Templeton — whose late goal rescued Rangers from embarrassment at Alloa on Saturday — to replace the ineffectual Fraser Aird. Yet it was Law who set up the goal Rangers so coveted. He headed forward to allow Shiels to advance on MacDonald. The keeper did manage to get a glove on his shot but it was not enough to stop the ball ending up in the net. Shiels would later depart to a standing ovation as he made way for 18-year-old Rangers debutant Ryan Hardie. Black, who believes Rangers can win this competition for their first cup win since 2011, then made their passage safe by smashing in a terrific third goal from 25 yards into the top left corner. It was a fittingly classy end to what had been a pulsating encounter.","Rory Loy gave Falkirk the lead on their plastic pitch after five minutes .

"Alastair Cook will lead England on their seven-match one-day international tour of Sri Lanka. Cook's position as ODI, and therefore World Cup, captain has been the subject of much conjecture over the past two months - with critics citing his mediocre strike-rate at the top of the order as a significant concern. But England's selectors have kept faith, naming him on Wednesday in a 16-man squad for the tour of Sri Lanka in November and December - meaning Cook can begin planning in earnest his team's World Cup campaign in Australia and New Zealand early next year. Alastair Cook’s will lead England on ODI tour of Sri Lanka and more than likely the World Cup . National selector James Whitaker and his panel of head coach Peter Moores, Angus Fraser and Mick Newell met to agree the strategy for the winter and decided to stick by the 29-year-old – even though England have lost five One Day series while he has been in charge. Pundits like Geoff Boycott, Michael Vaughan and Graeme Swann have all demanded change and pointed out Cook’s poor form in ODIs – he hasn’t made 80 in a 50-over match in more than two years. But they decided that with Eoin Morgan and Joe Root the only possible alternatives there was nothing to be gained by dumping the skipper.

"John Collins insists he can see progress at Celtic as manager Ronny Deila finds himself under continuing scrutiny ahead of the League Cup third-round clash with Hearts at Parkhead on Wednesday night. The Norwegian has been criticised for some of his signings, team selections and results since taking over from Neil Lennon in the summer. The Hoops were effectively knocked out of the Champions League qualifiers twice, leaving them in the Europa League, and have already dropped seven Premiership points in six matches. Celtic manager John Collins (middle) is confident the club can make progress under Ronny Delia . Maribor players celebrate scoring against Celtic in their Champions League play-off qualifier second leg tie . Celtic's 1-1 home draw with Motherwell on Sunday, where Deila made six changes to his starting line-up, brought a fresh wave of criticism to the door of the former Stromsgodset boss. However, his assistant manager Collins said: 'When a new manager and new players come in it takes time for them to gel and to get to know each other. 'But when you are a big club, of course, you have to try to win the majority of matches and we know that. 'When you are Celtic manager or assistant manager you are always judged. That is the reality of the job. But obviously it takes time. 'A lot of new players have come in, a lot on loan and they have to adapt to Scottish football and the surroundings. 'They are working hard on the training pitch. It takes time, it is not going to be perfect right away but we see progress.' Much has been made of Deila's assertion that fitness levels are not yet where they should be, although he stressed no implied criticism of predecessor Lennon. For his part, Collins aspires to the fitness heights reached by World Cup and Champions League winners. The former Scotland, Celtic and Hibernian midfielder said: 'We can all get better and learn from other countries. 'You look round the world and the top teams are all fit and go for 90 minutes. 'We all watch the Champions League, World Cups, teams like Bayern Munich and Real Madrid, the top players, and they are all super-fit nowadays. The Celtic manager is already under pressure after a series of below-par performances from Celtic . 'Look at the top nations who are winning. You just have to watch their performances and look at them and see that they are doing something right.' Turning to domestic concerns, Collins accepts that despite Celtic's indifferent start to the season, they will still be expected to progress past Championship leaders Hearts, who are fresh from a 5-1 win over Cowdenbeath at the weekend. The former Hibernian boss said: 'I saw Hearts at the weekend and they played very well. 'They are playing with a lot of confidence as you would imagine for a team at the top of the league. 'I would imagine the pressure is on us. The expectation is for the home team to win the game. 'I don't think it will be an open game from start to finish, maybe they will try to keep it tight early in the game. Collins insists striker Leigh Griffiths still has a future at Parkhead despite being left out of the squad recently . 'But it is up to us to try to control the game, create chances and put the ball into the back of the net.' Collins believes Leigh Griffiths still has a future at Parkhead and could demonstrate that against the Jambos. The Hoops striker, left out of the squad in recent games, has been linked with an emergency loan move to boyhood heroes Hibs, where he had a successful loan period before he moved from Wolves to Parkhead. 'I think he enjoys playing against Hearts, doesn't he?' said Collins. 'He is in the squad for Wednesday. He trained very well on Tuesday. 'He is a Celtic player. There is no problem. There is competition for places and we have four strikers fighting for the one central striker's position. 'Leigh has to work in training and prove to the manager that he deserves a jersey.'

"James Taylor and Ravi Bopara will be handed a late World Cup opportunity when they are named in an England one-day squad laden with experience to take on Sri Lanka under Alastair Cook’s captaincy. England will reveal what is, with the exception of the injured Stuart Broad, effectively their World Cup hand when they unveil a 16-man squad that will rely heavily on the tried and trusted rather than any radical late changes. There is no place for Surrey’s big-hitting Jason Roy, who England believe is not yet ready for 50-over international cricket, but there are reprieves for Taylor and Bopara who both missed out on the 3-1 one-day series defeat by India. James Taylor will be handed a late World Cup opportunity when named in the ODI squad to face Sri Lanka . Probable  squad for Sri Lanka: Cook (captain), Hales, Moeen, Root, Morgan, Buttler (keeper), Stokes, Woakes, Bopara, Bell, Taylor, Finn, Anderson, Gurney, Tredwell, Jordan. The unlucky Taylor has been consistently overlooked but is finally rewarded for prolific runscoring for Nottinghamshire, particularly in limited-overs cricket, while Bopara is welcomed back after his controversial omission. Ian Bell, despite only three hundreds in 148 one-day internationals, makes the cut for a seven-match series in Sri Lanka that will provide testing preparation for England in November and December ahead of February’s World Cup. Gary Ballance, who averages 52 in domestic one-day cricket for Yorkshire, could be the most unlucky casualty of England’s inconsistent one-day cricket as he looks sure to miss out despite playing in only one match against India. The retention of Cook as captain was far less certain in one-day cricket than for the Test arena but the vote of confidence from the selectors now is confirmation of their desire for him to lead England in the World Cup. Ravi Bopara (pictured playing for Essex in the County Championship on Wednesday) will also be included . Alastair Cook will lead England at next year's World Cup in Australia and New Zealand . Eoin Morgan's form in the 50-over game has been a source of concern for the England selectors . Ian Bell has made the cut despite scoring just three hundreds in 148 one-day internationals . Cook has his detractors in limited-overs cricket but the fact remains that he has five one-day hundreds, is one of the top 10 runscorers in world 50-over cricket since the last World Cup and has a strike-rate as captain comparable to Michael Clarke’s. He has silenced doubters before and is determined to do so again, as he told Sportsmail in an exclusive interview where he said he would be 'devastated' to miss out now, before almost certainly handing over the one-day reins after the World Cup. The difficulties encountered by Alex Hales on his step up to 50-over international cricket against India, where he was quickly worked out by Indian seamers using two new white balls, convinced the selectors that there is still more chance of Test-class batsmen in Cook and Bell scoring centuries than an exciting Twenty20 rookie like Roy. There have been more concerns among the selectors about Eoin Morgan’s form than Cook’s but he made a welcome return to something close to his best in the Twenty20 international that finished the international season. Morgan remains a key figure if England are going to upset the odds and compete for their long overdue first World Cup title, something they have not come even close to since losing the 1992 final to Pakistan in Melbourne. England have under-achieved in limited-overs cricket for much of the 22 years since but they did briefly reach the top of the world one-day standings two years ago and reached the final of last year’s Champions Trophy under Cook’s captaincy and using the traditional one-day methods they continue to advocate now. That means they will look to the likes of Cook, Bell and Joe Root to provide the anchor role and try to bat throughout the innings, leaving wickets in hand for Morgan, Bopara and Jos Buttler to explode in the final overs. There have been selectorial concerns over the one-dimensional nature of Harry Gurney but he survives now in a largely unchanged bowling attack because of coach Peter Moores preference for a left-armer and with there being few viable alternatives. Essex’s Reece Topley remains highly-regarded but he has suffered a recurrence of serious back problems this season and is not fit enough to be considered now. The England Performance Squad, which will be based in Sri Lanka at the same time as the one-day series, will provide Roy with one last chance to stake his claim but time is running out for him and other aspirants to gatecrash England’s World Cup party. Surrey's big-hitting Jason Roy looks set to miss the cut as England don't believe he's ready for 50-over cricket .","Alastair Cook will lead England for the one-day series starting in November .

"Victoria Azarenka will miss rest of the tennis season as she tries to make a full recovery from injuries that plagued her year, the former world number one said on Sunday. The two-time grand slam champion withdrew from this week's Wuhan Open in China with a foot injury and later announced she would be out of action for the remainder of the season. 'Unfortunately I will not be competing in any tournaments for the remainder of the season,' the 25-year-old Belarusian said in a message on her Facebook page. 'It has been a very tough year for me. Former Australian Open winner Victoria Azarenka's season has been ended by a foot injury . 'I have been trying my best to improve day in and day out by pushing and pushing... but that does not appear to be the best approach for me right now.
