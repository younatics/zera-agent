"By . Dan Bloom . A health trust which discharged more than 800 suspected cancer patients was warned about its blunders by a GP - but did nothing to stop them for a year. An investigation has revealed a clutch of failings at the West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust, where 810 patients were not chased up after missing urgent cancer appointments. The independent probe was launched earlier this year after it was revealed at least one patient involved in the scandal had died. Failings: 810 patients were not chased up after missing urgent cancer appointments at the West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust, which comprises three hospitals including Watford General (pictured) More than 100 others may have had life-threatening delays thanks to the blunders at the Trust, which runs Watford, St Albans and Hemel Hempstead Hospitals in Hertfordshire. The patients failed to attend urgent cancer checkups, possibly because they did not receive appointment letters. They should have been contacted immediately and offered another appointment within two weeks. Instead it is thought they were either discharged or given non-urgent appointments. Now the final report reveals a GP warned there could be a major problem in November 2012 - a full year before the Trust launched its investigation. The GP's fears were not followed up because there were not 'appropriate systems' to deal with complaints, the report said, and there was a 'lack of continuity in leadership'. An independent investigation into the blunders at the Trust has revealed a GP warned there could be a major problem in November 2012 - a full year before the Trust launched its investigation . Former chief executive: Jan Filochowski left in late 2012 and moved on to Great Ormond Street, London . Instead it took another wider review for the blunders to come to light. The report said: 'In . November 2012, [the Trust] received a GP’s formal complaint that . patients referred with suspected cancer on a two-week wait pathway may . have been discharged after one Did Not Attend. 'In . response to the investigation clinicians were reminded of the policy. The formal complaint response in July 2013 acknowledged the issues and . committed to actions to resolve them. 'As . the appropriate systems were not in place to deal with complaints . management at that time and due to a lack of continuity in leadership . and ownership to address the issues, progress was not followed up.' New chief: Samantha Jones ordered a review of the system for booking appointments in November . Only . at a separate, later training session did it become apparent that . patients were not being offered a second appointment, the report said. 'This . was the trigger to instigate the internal incident investigation - . Operation Bloom - in November 2013. The GP complaint was reviewed again . as part of this investigation.' The report, released yesterday, also revealed an audit was promised in July last year but did not happen because 'leadership changes at executive level' caused confusion as to who was in charge. Not only were staff unsure who had the final responsibility for 'two-week wait' cancer patients - the top directors on the hospitals' board also did not know for sure who was in charge. The report added: 'This is a complex, challenged Trust and the senior leadership prioritised the known performance issues, giving lower priority to seeking assurance that the performance measures marked green really had no problems.' The hospital's £280,000-a-year former chief executive, Jan Filochowski, left just a month before the GP's complaint and was replaced by Samantha Jones. Mr Filochowski joined Great Ormond Street Hospital but retired just over a year into his post, saying he wanted to focus on NHS consultancy and business books. Ms Jones said yesterday the health trust now has a 'comprehensive cancer improvement plan' in place. 'I apologise unreservedly to the patients and families affected and wish to assure them that we have already put failsafe mechanisms in place to stop these issues arising again,' she said. 'We have published the report to share the findings with our patients and local community. 'We will continue to work in partnership with local and national health partners to ensure all aspects of the cancer referral pathway can be improved to enhance the patient care experience.'","Investigation: Patients failed at West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust .

"By . Dan Bloom . Cat owners fear a killer is on the loose after six pets in the same street were killed with antifreeze in one week. The RSPCA has launched an investigation over the string of poisonings in Albert Street, a quiet terrace in Padiham, Lancashire, with so many pets it is nicknamed 'cat street'. Residents and the charity believe an assassin has used antifreeze deliberately in an act of spite - risking jail or a £20,000 fine. The owners say they have heard mysterious . noises in the dead of night and have found seedlings soaked in a . luminous liquid, which they have passed to the RSPCA as evidence. Peace shattered: Albert Street, a quiet terrace in Padiham, Lancashire (left), has so many pets it is nicknamed 'cat street' - but they are being killed in quick succession with antifreeze. One victim was Diesel (right) Devastating: Carer Emma Mayor, 34, had to take three-year-old male Gizmo (pictured) to the vet to be put down . One resident, carer Emma Mayor, 34, had to take three-year-old male Gizmo to the vet after he appeared to be ‘drunk’ and was struggling to walk. She and her daughter Cadie, 17, were told he had been poisoned and he was put down on June 21. 'Gizmo wasn’t just a cat, he was the love of my life,' she said. 'I got him when my mother died and he cheered me up and just became part of the family. 'He was my little boy. I’m devastated by what’s happened. 'The cases have been adding up and up. We knew there were six but we think there could be eight or nine now.' Cadie added: 'People call this street ""cat street"" because there’s so many people that have cats. Victims: Emma Mayor and her daughter Cadie lost their three-year-old male Gizmo to antifreeze . 'Someone must be doing it deliberately. Who would be using antifreeze in June?' Another owner, Vivien Storey, 44, had to watch her 14-year-old long-haired tabby Diesel having a fit before dying last Thursday. 'I'm absolutely horrified and . devastated,' she said. 'She was sitting there on the floor with black . stuff coming out of her mouth. I couldn't watch'. 'I'm absolutely horrified and . devastated. She was sitting there on the floor with black . stuff coming out of her mouth. I couldn't watch' - Vivien Storey on losing her tabby Diesel, 14 . Used as an engine coolant, antifreeze is highly toxic to cats, which can be killed by drinking just a small amount. It is far more dangerous than other poisons because cats are attracted to its sweet taste and symptoms can only begin hours after ingestion. They react to its main ingredient ethylene glycol, which is also poisonous to humans and causes a host of symptons include the loss of muscle control, vomiting and seizures. It would not by any means be the first deliberate poisoning attack on cats. Previous cases have seen antifreeze used in acts of revenge against cats who prowl neighbours' gardens unwanted, or simply in sadistic killings. Owners in Coventry, West Midlands, were horrified in January after nine of their cats died in a single week. As well as investigating the events in Albert Street, the RSPCA is probing other recent cat deaths in the nearby towns of Nelson and Colne. Inspector Charlotte Booker said: 'This is an extremely serious offence and offenders will face a jail sentence or a fine of up to £20,000 if and when we catch them. Appalled: Vivien Storey had to watch her 14-year-old long-haired tabby Diesel having a fit before dying . 'This is a horrendous act of cruelty against pets that are much-loved and it will not be tolerated. 'We also want to urge all cat owners in these areas to be vigilant and to look out for the symptoms of poisoning. 'Cats often look as though they are drunk and struggle to move around as normal. 'If anyone notices any of these symptoms, please get your cat to the vets straight away. 'Once cats have ingested antifreeze, they deteriorate quickly and will be dead in 24 hours if not treated immediately.' Anyone with any information on the poisonings should call the RSPCA on 0300 1234 999.","RSPCA is investigating poisonings in Albert Street, Padiham, Lancashire .

"By . Michael Zennie . When Megan Seabolt spotted red marks on her 16-month-old son's leg after she picked him up from daycare last week, the boy's caretakers told her it was just a rash from a bug bite - nothing to worry about. When the marks got worse and not better, the Gainesville, Georgia, mother took little Damon to the hospital, where doctors diagnosed him with second-and-third degree burns  on his leg and stomach and rushed him a intensive care at a burn unit. Police have now arrested the owner of the daycare, Discovering Basics, as well as her daughter and one employee on charges that they refused to get treatment for Damon and then tried to cover up that the injury ever happened. Scroll down for video . Little Damon suffered horrible second and third-degree burns on his leg, which daycare workers tried to pass off as a bug bite . Untreated: For eight hours, the 16-month-old languished without medical attention. His caretakers only slabbed ointment on his leg . Megan Seazbolt, seen here with baby Damon, said she is certain her child sustained the burns at daycare . For nearly eight hours on June 13, the boy languished without medical treatment and only topical burn ointment to treat the severe injuries he received, WSB-TV reports. An attorney for Ms Seabolt says Damon could have scars for the rest of his life. On Monday police arrested Discovering basics owner Minnie 'Sue' Dupree and daughter, Tara Miller, the daycare director. Last Friday, deputies also busted Eddye Pittmon, 55. Pittmon and Miller are charged with child cruelty. Dupree faces a lesser charge, witness tampering, for allegedly trying to cover up her employees' actions. Mike Weaver, Ms Seabolt's attorney, said he believe the burns could have come from a pot of boiling water that the daycare keeps to warm up bottles. Charged: Tara Miller, the manager of the daycare, (left) was charged with child cruelty. Her mother Minnie 'Sue' Dupree, the owner, is accused of trying to cover up the evidence . Teacher Eddye Pittmon, 55, was arrested last Friday and charged with child neglect . 'When a baby is in childcare the whole point of the care part is for them to be taken care of,' Ms Seabolt told WXIA-TV. 'By the time I got to the hospital, there was no skin left on his leg.' The Burn Center at Doctors Hospital in Augusta grafted skin onto the burns, though Damon has a long road to recovery. Lawyers for Ms Pittmon denied that Damon was burned at the daycare and pointed the finger at Ms Seabolt - and the 30 minutes that elapsed between the time she picked him up and the time that she took him to the hospital.","Megan Seabolt found red marks on her son's legs when she picked him up from daycare on June 13 .

"By . Dan Bloom . A third premature baby has died after being fed using a contaminated hospital feed drip. The infant was given a tainted batch of a fluid called total parenteral nutrition (TPN) at Cambridge's Rosie Hospital, and died on Sunday after battling blood poisoning for several weeks. Investigators now believe up to 23 babies were fed using the tainted batch at 11 intensive care units across England. Three have died. Tragic: A third baby has died after being given a contaminated batch of drip feed which affected 23 newborns. The latest death was at the Rosie Hospital in Cambridge, on the same site as Addenbrooke's (pictured) The baby was fed using the tainted drip on May 27, the same day authorities believe it was delivered by London pharmaceutical firm ITH Pharma. Health chiefs previously believed there were 22 cases - 18 confirmed and four possible - but the infant who died this weekend has now been linked to the ongoing investigation. A . spokesman for Public Health England said: 'Since the last update on . June 12, 2014, a further case has been identified and the total number . of cases linked to this investigation is 23 - 19 confirmed and four . possible cases. 'This baby . has sadly died and our thoughts are with the family. This is the third . confirmed case to have died and all three cases have been reported to . the coroner. Scandal: The babies were fed on a drip because they were too premature to feed, but became ill after being given an infected batch (file picture) 'The baby most . recently identified received the implicated batch of TPN from May 27, . 2014, but did not immediately develop sepsis so did not fit the case . definition of the outbreak at that time. 'However, recent microbiological tests have shown the presence of the outbreak strain.' Produced by London pharmaceutical firm ITH Pharma, TPN is designed to feed babies born prematurely who are too weak to eat on their own. The most recent victim of the tainted batch, who has not been named, fell ill several weeks ago at the Rosie, which is on the same site as Cambridge's Addenbrooke's Hospital and run by the same health trust. A spokesman for the trust said: 'Our . thoughts are with the family and we are supporting them during this very . difficult and emotional time. 'A consultant neonatologist has spoken to all of the families on the unit. 'The . babies on the unit have been closely monitored for any signs of . infection since we withdraw the contaminated feed. We are confident that . no other newborns have contracted bacillus cereus. 'The two other babies who were ill are stable and doing well.' Outbreaks have occurred across England, including at London's Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation . Trust, Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust, The Whittington . Hospital and the Harley Street Clinic. Outside London other outbreaks have been at Brighton & Sussex University Hospital NHS Trust, Luton and Dunstable University Hospital, Peterborough City . Hospital, Southend University Hospital, Stoke Mandeville Hospital and . Basildon University Hospital. The first baby to die was nine-day-old Yousef Al-Kharboush on June 1 at St Thomas' Hospital, London. Upsetting: 11 hospitals in England were affected. The Rosie Hospital based at Addebrooke's in Cambridge now has three cases, a rise from the two investigators had previously linked to the contaminated drips . The second was not named but died . midway through last month. Officials said at the time that the death did . not appear to be linked to the infection itself. Investigators have almost finished their inquiry and believe the contamination was an 'isolated incident'. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is used to slowly drip-feed patients who are too weak to eat. It is not just used for babies - patients commonly receive it directly into their bloodstream for 10 or 12 hours at a time. It is believed the contaminated batch contained the bacteria Bacillus cereus. The bacteria are often found in cooked foods like rice and soups which have been left at room temperature for too long. They produce toxins which cause diahorrhea, stomach cramps and vomiting when eaten. But because the toxins were injected directly into the bloodstream and the patients were babies with a poor immune system, they would have had a more serious effect. How the bacteria could have ended up inside a medical drip is still being investigated. Professor . Mike Catchpole, incident director at Public Health England, said: 'The main findings . have all pointed towards there being a single incident that occurred on . one day. 'We . are reassured that this was a very rare occurrence as we have not seen . this particular strain of bacteria in any product made since that day . and there has been no further illness.' Gerald Heddell, a director at the Medicines and Healthcare products . Regulatory Agency (MHRA), added: 'At this . stage, our investigation has provided sufficient evidence to indicate . that the contamination was introduced into the specific Total Parenteral . Nutrition (TPN) supplies during manufacture in a particular sterile . manufacturing area at ITH Pharma on May 27, 2014. 'There . is no evidence to suggest that individual ingredients, components or . materials used for the manufacture of TPN on May 27, 2014, were the . cause of the contamination. 'However, . what we do know from our investigation is that the strain of Bacillus . cereus which infected the babies has also been identified at ITH . Pharma’s manufacturing facility and within some of the unopened TPN . supplies manufactured on May 27, 2014. 'From . our investigation to date, we continue to believe this was an isolated . incident and that appropriate immediate action has been taken at ITH . Pharma’s facility to avoid a recurrence. 'Therefore we are allowing this critical product to be supplied to patients while our investigation continues.'","Up to 23 babies given tainted feed at 11 intensive care units in England .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . Lance Corporal Jon Le Galloudec is the first person in the UK to own £5,000 futuristic fibreglass leg casts. They store energy from his working muscles n his upper legs to propel his lower legs forward when he steps . A soldier told he would never walk again after being paralysed in a sniper attack has defied doctors by running - thanks to the UK’s first ‘bionic’ splints. Lance Corporal Jon Le Galloudec, 33, was blasted in the spine on a night time mission in Iraq. Doctors told him he was lucky to be alive but he was paralysed from the waist down and would never walk again. But now, thanks to the UK’s first highly advanced bionic splints, he has defied all the odds to run - after just three weeks of having them. L/cpl Galloudec said: 'For the first time in seven years not only can I stand still - but I can run. “It was an absolutely wonderful feeling to just give it a go and I haven’t stopped since. It is just great to be as normal as I can be. 'I said to my wife I’ll have to sign myself up for a fun run, or something. 'It’s fair to say I’m not going to be the next Mo Farah, but you never know. It is amazing.' L/cpl Galloudec joined the 2nd Battalion Royal Green Jackets in 1999, aged 19. He was a month into his tour in the Al Aliyah district in 2007 when he was attacked during an arrest and detain mission. The gunfire from a sniper narrowly missed his head before he was shot in the spine by a bullet that 'felt like a sledgehammer. Jon’s best friend Corporal Rodney Wilson, 30, heard him scream 'man down' and ran back 40 yards - under heavy fire - to retrieve him. He dragged L/cpl Galloudec to within just a few metres of safety when he was fatally struck in the chest with a bullet. He went down, dragging me with him,' recalls L/cpl Galloude, from Bath, Somerset. 'I whispered his name and when there was nothing from him I knew he was dead . From then on I was on my own.' He was eventually retrieved by colleagues just seconds before he fell unconscious, convinced he was going to die. In 2007, he was attacked during an arrest and detain mission. The gunfire from a sniper narrowly missed his head before he was shot in the spine by a bullet, leaving him paralysed. He is  pictured right in rehabilitation . He then endured a six-hour operation at the field hospital at Basra Air Station to repair his internal organs which had been ripped apart by the bullet. Within days, he was flown to Birmingham’s Selly Oak hospital, and then on to Stoke Mandeville where doctors said he would never walk again. But he soon regained feeling in some of his upper leg muscles and, just eight weeks later, he defied them with a few very shaky steps out of the hospital, spurred on by the memory of his best friend who saved his life. L/cpl Galloude was funded by Help For Heroes so the charity can analyse his progress in a bid to convince the government to fund other paralysed patients . In 2010 L/cpl Galloudec was fitted with conventional splints, but the ill-fitting devices would cut and bruise his legs. The constant pain meant he could only wear them for a few hours at a time. Even when he did wear them, he had to constantly move around to stop himself toppling over - and was often confined to a wheelchair. Then, this year Help For Heroes put him forward for the new prosthetics, called exo-skeleton orthotics. The £5,000 futuristic fibreglass leg casts - funded by the charity - store energy from Jon’s working muscles in his upper legs to propel his lower legs forward when he steps. They slide into his shoes and round his legs below the knee. 'The first night I got them I wanted to wear them to bed, I didn’t want to take them off,' said L/cpl Galloude, who is married to Elizabeth, 32. 'The independence they have given me is amazing. Rodney Wilson gave his life so that I could live mine - now I have to live life for two people.' L/cpl Galloude was funded by Help For Heroes so the charity can analyse his progress in a bid to convince the government to fund other paralysed patients. Bryn Parry co-founder of Help for Heroes said: 'If successful then it’s only right that the government funds this technology for others with a similar injury to Jon’s.'","Lance Corporal Jon Le Galloudec, 33, was blasted in the spine .

The band, called Unfathomable Ruination, has been performing on the streets of London as part of a project called Box Sized DIE and they play until the oxygen runs out. The idea was the creation of Portuguese artist Joao Onofre which formed part of an exhibition called Sculpture in the City. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Art?

This performance art involves one sound-proof steel cube and a metal band that plays inside until oxygen runs out . The band will be performing three times a week until August 1 in London's financial district and much like the offices around it, passers-by cannot hear or see what is going on inside. According to the musicians, conditions inside the cube are extremely hot, but they feel it is worth it all in the name of art. Daniel Herrera, Unfathomable Ruination’s guitarist, said: ‘These are extreme conditions and we play extreme music so this our connection.’ The band play first with the doors open and then with the doors closed. One band member wipes away sweat from his face after playing in the airtight steel box . The band told CNN that although conditions inside the cube are extremely hot they felt it was worth it .

"By . Tara Brady . The cost of the most expensive West End theatre ticket has tripled over the past ten years, new research has revealed. The highest price for a theatre seat is currently the £152.25 charged for The Book of Mormon at the Prince of Wales Theatre in London. This is 20 per cent higher than the £127 price charged for the satirical musical last year, according to a survey by the actors' newspaper The Stage. Expensive night out: The highest price for a theatre seat is £152.25 for The Book of Mormon (pictured) at the Prince of Wales Theatre in London - 20 per cent higher than the price last year . This new premium seat price is more than three times the amount charged for a similar West End show in 2004. The top rate then was the £49 charged for The Producers. The second most expensive seats for The Book of Mormon are now £127.50 - more than double the rate of a year ago, the survey found. The average price of a theatre ticket is now £99.78 - up from £95.09 last year. The Book of Mormon is currently being shown at the Prince of Wales Theatre in London's  West End . The survey also discovered that average prices for customers wishing for the best seats at West End plays have also risen from £78.24 last year to £80.45 this year. The shift in prices comes despite a crackdown by advertising watchdogs on extra fees being charged on tickets. Extra fees, which are charges not immediately made clear to theatregoers when they begin booking, have dropped to an average of just 32p - down from £1.12 last year. Jonathan Brown, chief executive of the Society of Ticket Agents and Retailers, explained that the drop does not mean fees are disappearing. He said the decrease was the result of ticket companies abiding by the Committee of Advertising Practice's regulations, which were revised last year to make sure firms disclose fees from the start. He said: 'We know from the growth of the ticket resale market that customers are prepared to pay a high price for sought-after tickets, and the premium prices we see for some shows are a reflection of that. 'As the technology, science and commercial wisdom behind dynamic pricing find their place in theatre ticketing systems, there is no doubt we are going to see an increase in flexible pricing models in the next few years.'","Most expensive ticket at the moment costs £152.25 for The Book of Mormon .

"By . Stephanie Condron . A foreign businessman who bombarded Britons with 500,000 spam text messages a day has been convicted after being exposed by a Mail on Sunday undercover investigation. But Jayesh Shah, 43, has escaped with just a £4,000 fine – and investigators say he may still be plaguing mobile phone users with unsolicited texts and nuisance calls. Shah, who runs a call centre business based in India, was revealed to be behind thousands of spam messages inviting people to claim compensation for mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI) in December 2012. He was prosecuted for breaching the Data Protection Act at a trial in May. Judgment was reserved to a hearing last week at Willesden Magistrates’ Court in North-West London, when Shah was found guilty and fined. He did not attend the hearing. Jayesh Shah was found guilty of being a PPI text spammer after being exposed by the Mail on Sunday for allegedly bombarding people with half a million spam messages a day . Shah had tried to argue at the trial in May that British law did not apply to him because he operated out of India. But a district judge ruled that Shah did have to obey UK laws because he came here touting for business. However, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) admits it does not know whether Shah is still sending spam texts and nuisance calls – although the ruling means they can continue to investigate him. The ICO’s David Clancy said: ‘Shah cannot just sit in India and say, “I am going to generate all these calls to the UK and nothing is going to happen.” ‘Shah made it quite clear he came to the UK to speak to clients. As far as we are aware, he’s still operating. ‘It’s difficult to say whether he’s still doing it because he does not identify who he is when he’s making calls or who the [text message] sender is. ‘The options for us are to review whatever evidence we have in relation to his business operations based in the UK.’ Shah is chief executive of his IT company Vinayak Infotech & Telecommunications Solutions (Vintels), based in the Indian city of Pune, 90 miles east of Mumbai. Vintels closed down its website last week but Shah is still registered with UK authorities as someone who handles the personal data of Britons. It was on one of his trips to the UK in December 2012 that Shah boasted to an undercover Mail on Sunday reporter how his firm had sent huge numbers of messages telling people they were entitled to free refunds on the PPI policies they had taken out. This woman looks pleased to receive a text so it probably is not a spam from Shah's company . Anyone who responded to the texts was seen as a ‘lead’, and their mobile number was sold to a claims management company for up to £7.50. Shah told our reporter he had made millions of pounds out of his business, and claimed he was immune from prosecution as it operated from outside the UK. But he tangled himself up with red tape. Anyone selling debt leads in the UK has to have a consumer credit licence and Shah obeyed that rule. He also registered as a ‘data controller’ with the ICO. But he failed to declare the true nature of his business on the register – that of ‘lead generating’ or selling and using people’s phone numbers for marketing – and it was on that breach he was found guilty. The judge decided he could not argue that UK laws did not apply to him because his operation was abroad as he had a UK consumer credit licence. District Judge Mark Jabbitt said: ‘I’m dealing with a failure to keep his entry up to date. I’m not dealing with his company’s sending millions of unsolicited text messages to people in this country.’ Shah provided no explanation why he was not present or represented, and in his absence was fined £4,000 for the breach, ordered to pay £2,703 costs and a £400 victim surcharge within 28 days or a warrant can be issued for his arrest. The British authorities have found it almost impossible to get to the bottom of Shah’s operations because he does not have a base here – he used to sleep on his sister’s sofa in North-West London when he came to the UK touting for business. After the case, one of Shah’s victims, wholesale firm boss Ian Lithgow, 51, from Whitstable in Kent, said: ‘It’s a victory but it does not stop it. I think Shah has got off lightly. He should have got a bigger fine.’","Jayesh Shah, 43, fined just for breaching Data Protection Act .

"By . Tara Brady . A robber has been jailed for life after a member of the public spotted him trying to hold up a bank with a fake gun. Andrew Fernandez’s life of crime came to an end when he walked in to the Lloyds bank in Coulsdon, Croydon, in November only to be detained by customer James Rowley until police arrived and arrested him. Fernandez, of no fixed abode, who had pleaded guilty to two counts of robbery and one count of attempted robbery was sentenced to life imprisonment at Kingston Crown Court while Mr Rowley has won a £1,200 police bravery award for helping to trap him. Scroll down for video . CCTV footage of Andrew Fernandez (left) who has been jailed for life after a member of the public James Rowley (right) spotted him trying to hold up a bank with a fake gun . Wearing a motorcycle helmet, Fernandez, 47, demanded money from the cashier and threatened her with what appeared to be a hand gun. Mr Rowley, who was also inside the bank at the time, spotted the gun was a fake and told Fernandez to leave. Fernandez did not take the hint and kept threatening the cashier. It was only after Mr Rowley challenged him that Fernandez decided to flee - on a push bike. The getaway failed as Mr Rowley, helped by a friend who was in a nearby van, chased him down and held him until the police arrived. CCTV footage shows Andrew Fernandez (right) and James Rowley (left) in the Lloyds bank . Mr Rowley told detectives he had seen Fernandez throw something into a nearby building site. They later found the fake firearm and detectives from the Metropolitan Police’s Flying Squad were able to link Fernandez with two, almost identical robberies. Fernandez pleaded guilty to two counts of robbery and one count of . attempted robbery . The first robbery took place on July 12, 2013 in The Broadway, Mill Hill, Barnet while the second robbery took place on September 27, 2013 in Garston Park Parade, Watford, Hertfordshire. Fernandez was subsequently charged with two additional counts of robbery and two counts of possession of an imitation firearm in relation to these incidents. Mr Rowley, who was presented with £1,200 from the sheriff’s fund for his bravery, at Kingston Crown Court, said: 'When I saw him enter the bank waving the gun around, making demands I just acted on instinct. 'I thought that the gun wasn’t real and therefore I knew I had to act. 'At the time I didn’t think it was brave I thought it was my duty to get involved, ignoring it was not the answer. 'I told him to leave and then he tried to escape I immediately thought no he is not going to get away with this so chased him with the help of my friend, holding him down until the officers came along. 'What’s happened since then with receiving an Assistant Commissioner’s commendation and now being awarded a police bravery award, well I am humbled.' He has also received a commendation for his actions by Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley and will also be awarded a Police Public Bravery Award at the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) annual awards ceremony on June 19. Detective Sergeant David Barnfather, of the Met’s Flying Squad, said: 'The bravery of James Rowley was truly remarkable in confronting what was for all intents and purposes, an armed and extremely dangerous criminal. 'Mr Rowley’s courage and sense of civic duty are to be applauded and thanks to him Fernandez is behind bars.'

"By . Andy Dolan . A heartbroken widow yesterday told how a catalogue of NHS errors ‘robbed’ her of the opportunity to say a final goodbye to her dying husband. Great-grandmother Edna Roberts, 75, was forced to call an ambulance four times before her husband of 50 years, Charles, was finally taken to hospital. A paramedic from the first ambulance told her to administer aspirin for Mr Roberts’ extreme pain, before a second crew scolded her for dialling 999. Edna Roberts, 74, was unable to say her last goodbye to her husband Charles after medical staff transferred him to another hospital without informing her . In a ‘final insult’, former soldier Mr . Roberts, 76 – who was suffering with a number of conditions – was then . transferred to a second hospital without his wife being told. The . blunder meant that when nurses called Mrs Roberts in the middle of the . night to warn her that her husband’s condition had ‘taken a dip’, she . took a taxi to the wrong hospital and did not reach his bedside until it . was too late. Yesterday Mrs Roberts said: ‘I’m devastated. I didn’t get a chance to say goodbye to Charles. Mr Roberts, 75, claims she had to call an ambulance four times on the day her husband Charles, 76, died before they agreed take him to hospital . ‘I never got to hear his last words. I should have been by his side when he passed, holding his hand as he went.’ She . said that while they were waiting for the ambulance after the fourth . 999 call she saw Mr Roberts cry ‘for the first time in his life’. Mrs . Roberts added: ‘He was never one to make a fuss, I would never have . called the ambulance in the first place if I didn’t think he was in a . very bad way. ‘Charles was in so much pain and just wanted it all to . end. He went with no dignity at all. I’d been by his side every night . for 50 years and I couldn’t be there for him at the end.’ Mrs Roberts . called 999 on June 22 after her husband, who had an aortic embolism and . chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, began struggling for breath and . suffering chest pains. But during two visits to the couple’s home in . Redditch, Worcestershire, she says paramedics told her she should only . call an ambulance in a ‘life or death’ situation and one simply . suggested Mr Roberts, who served in the Royal Artillery Regiment, take . two aspirin. After a third 999 call a doctor was sent out, and he . diagnosed Mr Roberts with a severe bladder infection and contacted an . ambulance to take him to hospital. Around 45 minutes later – after . Mrs Roberts had called 999 for a fourth time – Mr Roberts was taken to . the town’s Alexandra Hospital. She said that at 4am she received a call from a nurse urging her to rush to hospital as her husband’s condition had worsened. But . when the pensioner arrived at the Alexandra she was told Mr Roberts, a . retired factory worker, had been transferred to Worcestershire Royal . Hospital 17 miles away. Mrs Roberts, a retired cashier, added: ‘I am utterly disgusted with the hospital, and also with the ambulance staff.’ The couple’s six grown-up children all live in Norfolk. They also have 20 grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren. Lindsey . Webb, chief nursing officer from Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS . Trust, said Mr Roberts’ transfer ‘should have been communicated to Mrs . Roberts at the first possible opportunity’ and apologised for the . failure to do so. Mr Roberts was taken to Redditch's Alexandra Hospital for treatment. The next morning his wife said she received a call telling her that her husband had 'taken a dip' and could she get to the hospital immediately . After getting a taxi to the Alexandra Hospital she was then informed by a member of staff that they did not have a Mr Roberts admitted there. The staff member then returned to say her husband of 50 years had been transferred to Worcester Royal Hospital - 17 miles away . A West Midlands Ambulance Service spokesman said: . ‘On June 22, three calls were received in regard to a pre-existing . medical condition. The first ambulance arrived at 9.30am where the staff . found the patient in a stable condition and arranged for a GP to assess . him. A GP visited Mr Roberts and asked for Mr Roberts to be taken to . hospital once again. This was not an emergency case. ‘The trust is saddened to hear the comments of Mrs Roberts and would urgently like to speak to her to find out more.’","Charles Roberts was transferred to Worcester Royal Hospital in emergency .

"By . Tara Brady . Shot: Mother-of-one Sabrina Moss died in a hail of bullets in Kilburn High Road on August 24 last year as she celebrated her 24th birthday . A nursery teacher was shot dead by masked gunmen who wanted to send out a message they were not to be messed with, a court heard today. Mother-of-one Sabrina Moss died in a hail of bullets in Kilburn High Road, north west London, as she celebrated her 24th birthday in the early hours of August 24 last year. Her friend Sabrina Gachette, 24, and two other men, Mahad Ahmed and Edson Da Silva, were also injured during the shooting. The alleged killers are said to have armed themselves with a MAC-10 sub-machine gun and a sawn-off shotgun. Martell Warren, 22, Hassan Hussain, 29, and Yassin James, 19, are on trial for murder and attempted murder at the Old Bailey. All three deny shooting Moss and her friends. A fourth man, Simon Baptiste, 29, is also accused of involvement in the attack. Miss Moss, who lived in Neasden, north west London and worked at Alice’s Wonderland nursery in Stonebridge, had a four-year-old son. She died after suffering a gunshot wound to the chest. Members of the victim’s family were in court as the details of her final moments were described. Prosecutor Mark Heywood QC said: ‘The August bank holiday 2013 last year will live forever in the memory of some and that’s exactly by design. ‘The design of these defendants - those who committed the crimes at the heart of this case. ‘What they did was intended to send a message to those in their world that they were not to be trifled with or angered. ‘In the early hours of that Saturday of that weekend about an hour before dawn a planned attack was executed across one of the capital’s high roads to the north. A woman walks past a floral tribute to nursery teacher Sabrina Moss who was shot dead in Kilburn last year . ‘On one side of the road during the last minutes of a night out was a young mother partying with friends. ‘They were laughing, chatting and some were standing smoking on the pavements. ‘On the other side of the road were men with hoods over their heads, likely in gloves, faces covered - two killers. ‘Behind them a car facing the wrong way up a one-way street, in that was a man who wanted it done just as much as they - ready to speed them away. Simon Baptiste is said to have let the alleged gunmen use his house as a base for the killing . ‘They had selected their weapons not just because they fell to hand, each one designed to kill or maim at close quarters. ‘One a double-barreled weapon originally made for sport - now sawn-off and turned into a lethal weapon against humans specifically loaded with heavy shot. ‘The other a rapid fire machine gun, a Mac-10 designed to kill at short range. ‘This kind of weapon was invented for war and is so hard to come by it had been converted from a blank fire piece so as to be effective. ‘They, those people, had carried out surveillance of their targets and knew very well who their targets were and where they were.’ He added: ‘They ran out and fired at point blank range in a way that was as vicious as it was cowardly.’ Warren, Hussain and James deny murder, three counts of attempted murder, two counts of possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life and two counts of conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm. Baptiste is also charged with conspiring to cause grievous bodily harm. Mr Heywood said the killers unleashed ‘both barrels of the shotgun and two or three bursts of the machine gun so that when the noise and smoke drifted away two young women lay upon the pavement injured’. ‘One woman survived after deeply invasive surgery,’ he added. ‘The other couldn’t be saved even by that. ‘Two of the men were also hit.’ Mother Andrea Moss pictured leaving the Old Bailey today after hearing details of her daughter's murder . Mr Heywood described the murder as completely unjustified. ‘No one is likely to say that the killing of Sabrina Moss is not murder,’ he said. ‘There is and can be no justification for her murder. ‘No one will suggest that by shooting at the group as a whole and injuring those people who were shot the people responsible did not do so other than trying to kill them. ‘The sole question is whether the defendants joined in that attempt. ‘Are these defendants responsible for this?’ Miss Moss had been celebrating her birthday with a number of friends at Love and Liquor club in Kilburn. ‘She had a great many friends, a number of who were with her that night helping her celebrate,’ Mr Heywood said. The shootings were the tragic result of an ongoing violent dispute between the alleged killers and a group from South Kilburn, Mr Heywood told the jury. ‘The reason for that is not clear but it was serious, it was deep-seated - so deep-seated that it was enough to occupy their activities for most of that night,’ he continued. The accused murderers stalked their intended victims all night before launching the deadly attack, the court heard. Baptiste is said to have let the alleged gunmen use his house as a base for the killing. Warren, of Kensal Green, north west London; Hussain, of Cranhurst Road, Willesden Green, north west London; and James, of Wembley, north west London, deny murder, three counts of attempted murder, two counts of possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life, and conspiring to commit grievous bodily harm. Baptiste, of Cricklewood, in north west London, denies conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm. The trial continues.

"By . James  Nye . The body of a 31-year-old woman missing since her raft overturned in Colorado on Saturday was found on Thursday by her own brother. Amanda Taylor, 31, who was living in Vernal Utah, was whitewater rafting on the Arkansas River when she was tossed from the dinghy in the pitch black at around 10 pm when the boat missed a ramp and became stuck under a waterfall. He family rushed from their homes in Wyoming to help with the rescue and Taylor was discovered by her brother Beau Taylor only three miles from where she fell in. Drowning: Amanda Taylor (left and (right with her sister Brandy Taylor) passed away on Saturday in a rafting accident in Colorado . Family search: Amanda Taylor (pictured left with her sister, Ruby) was found by her brother, Beau, who stayed with her until search teams arrived . An autopsy performed on Thursday confirmed that she had tragically drowned when she and six others lost control of their raft in rapid waters. Five made it the shore and authorities rescued another 22-year-old man clinging to the raft. Undersheriff John Spezze said that search and rescue teams had scoured as far as 30 miles downstream and along the river's banks for Taylor, but the murkiness of the water made visibility difficult. The discovery of Amanda's body by her brother after four days of searching came after the involvement of five different local agencies. Amanda Taylor's brother spotted her body hanging on a branch close to the riverbank where the South Arkansas River meets the Arkansas River. Rafters navigate the whitewater rapids on the Arkansas River near Salida, Colorado: The search for a Utah woman who has been missing since her raft overturned Saturday night in the Arkansas River was called off on Thursday when Amanda Taylor's body found by her brother . He positively identified her when other search teams arrived and he and other family members held Taylor's body where it was found to stop it floating downstream according to The Mountain Mail. Bess said Taylor’s body must have recently floated down to where it was found after search teams had come through the area on rafts earlier. Other rafter's where much luckier than tragicTaylor. David Torchia, 22, was treated for bruises and hypothermia after he clung on for dear life to the raft when it flipped over. 'That was a near-death experience I didn’‍t think I’‍d be getting out of,' said  Torchia, who is a camp consultant at the summer at Rocky Mountain Village Easter Seals Camp in Empire, Colorado. Survivors: Local residents (Left to Right) John Wallace, Ashley Noble, Alex Marzec and David Torchia were involved in a whitewater rafting accident in Colorado on the Arkansas River over the Weekend . 'We were all being tossed around. It felt like being in a washing machine, being tossed around and turned around without any control of things.' Torchia said to the Toldedo Blade that the waterfall kept everyone pinned under in the water and the lack of light caused confusion in reaching the shore, but that everyone was wearing a lifejacket. Sheriff deputies said Mr. Torchia and his companions John Spalvins, 54, of Alex Marzec, 22, Ashley Noble, 21, Jill Bryant, 53, and John Wallace, 22, set off at around 4pm to arrive at the Salida boat ramp at 10pm.

Sean O'Connor was working in his backyard on Saturday under clear skies when suddenly he heard a clap of thunder. 'Just as I picked up the rake, I heard a loud crashing sound,' O'Connor said. 'A few moments later I was picking myself up off the ground. I had the taste of blood in my mouth. I noticed my leg was burning a little bit.' Scroll Down for Video . Lucky escape: Sean O'Connor was hit by lightning on Saturday while doing chores in his backyard on his own . Blast: Sean O'Connor's smoking shoes reveal the strength of the lightning strike that hit him on Saturday . Home on his own, O'Connor was dazed and confused from the lightning strike and only realized what had happened exactly as he stood and caught a distinct whiff. 'My leg hairs were singed. I could smell the burnt hair,' he explained to CBS46. 'I looked across the driveway and I could see my boots over there. They were no longer on my feet, and one of them was smoking. 'At that point I realized I had just been hit by lightning.' Left behind: Sean O'Connor's smoking shoes were videoed by the Atlanta man in the aftermath of his shocking lightning strike . Dazed and confused: The astonishingly lucky Atlanta man videoed himself in the seconds after the blast and showed off his singed arms . Melted: The damage left by the lighting strike caused Sean O'Connor's shoe to melt . He immediately called his wife to tell her and then took out his cellphone to record video of his smoking shoes and his bleeding tongue to prove it. In a video he shots seconds after the strike he appears confused and somewhat unsure. His wife told him to go to hospital immediately. 'In my mind, I'd survived a lightning strike, and I didn't think things could get any worse from there,' said O'Connor to CBS46. Lucky he did, because the lightning strike had interrupted the electrical rhythm of his heart and caused it to beat irregularly. Doctors kept him in overnight and he was visited by his family who were amazed at his lucky escape. 'I've had a lot of friends comment and ask me if I can now bend spoons with my mind, which I don't,' O'Connor said, smiling. O'Connor said doctors told him that lightning doesn't strike many people, about 1 in 700,000. And very few survive.","Sean O'Connor was struck by lightning on Saturday while doing chores in his backyard .

"By . Tara Brady . Erena Wilson, 31, from Hanwell, west London, was strolling through the Royal Botanical Gardens in September 2012 when she died . A mother has relived the horrifying moment a tree branch fell and killed her friend during her three-year-old's birthday party at Kew Gardens. Erena Wilson, 31, from Hanwell, west London, was strolling through the Royal Botanical Gardens in September 2012 when she died. It was only pure 'fluke' that her friend Tess Marshall’s daughter Ruby was not also killed because she had run ahead minutes before, John McLinden QC, the Wilson family’s lawyer, told an inquest at West London Coroner’s Court. Mr McLinden said it had been raining heavily in the hours leading up to the accident on September 23. Tree branches are vulnerable to dropping off suddenly when they endure long dry spells followed by heavy rain - a condition known as ‘summer branch drop’, the court heard. However, Kew Gardens failed to put up signs warning of the danger because it deemed the risk to be so minimal, Mr McLinden said. Ms Wilson was walking along a main path when Ms Marshall suddenly noticed a large Cedar of Lebanon branch, 20ft long and 12 inches thick, was crashing down from 20 yards above. Ms Marshall screamed ‘run’ and fled for her life, but when she looked back she saw Ms Wilson, an accounts manager, lying sprawled on her front on the ground surrounded by debris from the tree. Her voice dipping low as she recounted the tragedy, Ms Marshall said: 'We were chatting and then, all of a sudden, I hear this crack like a lightning crack. 'I look to my left and saw the scar of . a break in the tree so you could see the white colour underneath from a . branch that had just broken off right at the very top of the tree. 'There was a whole load of foliage, branches and stuff just falling above my head. Ms Wilson suffered severe head injuries including fractures, bruising on her left side and a brain injury when the Cedar of Lebanon branch came crashing down landing on top of the accounts manager . 'It blocked out the sky and all I could see was this umbrella of branches. 'As I was running, I thought the whole tree was falling over. I was sure it was going to hit me. I was running away and then I heard a heavy thud. An oomph.' She added: 'I wasn’t thinking, it was just instinct. I was just running.' She span around and saw her friend lying totally still on her front with blood coming out of her ears and mouth, forming a pool of blood under her face. The branch fell with such force that it brought two others down in its wake and smashed Ms Wilson’s backpack, making 'sawdust' of the glass inside. Erena Louise Wilson and right, a Lebanese cedar tree at Kew Gardens like the one Miss Wilson was hit by . Ms Marshall said: 'Because they had . stopped and seen everything my three-year-old was really upset and . crying so she went on with her auntie.' Ms . Marshall’s brother, who had been walking ahead with her daughter and . his wife, dashed back and gave CPR until paramedics and an air ambulance . arrived. But Ms Wilson . suffered severe head injuries, including fractures, bruising on her left . side and scalp and an extensive brain injury. She was pronounced dead . at 2.51pm - after 45 minutes of cardiac resuscitation. The tragedy happened at Kew Gardens in South West London after a large Cedar of Lebanon branch fell during bad weather in September 2012 killing Ms Wilson from Hanwell in west London . A post mortem found she died from 'multiple injuries'. Ms . Wilson, who was originally from Wellington, New Zealand, had arrived at . Kew at around 1.45pm and was walking with Ms Marshall while Ms . Marshall’s brother and sister-in-law strolled ahead. Just minutes before the branch fell, Ruby dashed ahead and 'ran free' with her uncle. Addressing . Ms Marshall, Mr McLinden said: 'It was just a matter of chance that . your daughter had run out of harm’s way prior to this. 'It was just a fluke that the three of you weren’t badly injured or worse by what happened.' Ms Marshall replied: 'Yes absolutely, guess it was a matter of chance. We were lucky.' The inquest continues.","Erena Wilson, 31, was walking through Kew Gardens when a large Cedar of Lebanon branch crashed down on top of her .

"By . James  Nye . US women's soccer star goalkeeper Hope Solo was arrested at a suburban Seattle home on suspicion of assaulting her sister and 17-year-old nephew, but her attorney insisted that Solo herself was a victim in the altercation. 'Hope is not guilty of any crime,' attorney Todd Maybrown said in an email sent on Saturday. 'In fact, our investigation reveals that Hope was assaulted and injured during this unfortunate incident. We look forward to the opportunity to present the true facts in court and to having this matter behind Hope very soon.' Officers responded to her sister's home just before 1 a.m. Saturday after receiving a 911 call that a woman at the Kirkland residence was hitting people and that she refused to stop or leave, the Kirkland Police Department said in a news release. Arrested: U.S. Olympic gold medalist soccer player Hope Solo was taken into custody early Saturday morning after reportedly got into a scuffle with her sister and nephew at her home in Seattle . Scene: Officers arrived at the home in the 10600 block of 124th AVE NE after a 911 caller stated a woman at the residence was 'hitting people' and that she refused to stop or leave . They found Solo intoxicated and upset, saw injuries on her nephew and her sister, and arrested her after speaking with those present and determining that she was the primary aggressor, the release said. She was booked into jail for investigation of two counts of fourth-degree domestic violence assault, and she was expected to remain in custody until an appearance Monday at Kirkland Municipal Court. A telephone number listed for her was not accepting incoming calls Saturday, and the voice mail for a listing at the sister's home was full. The sister was not identified by police, but in her memoir, Solo writes that she has a half sister named Terry. Solo, 32, has won two Olympic gold medals for the US women's national team. She also plays with the Seattle Reign of the National Women's Soccer League. This isn't the first altercation Solo has had with police. Reports show police were called to a disturbance at her Kirkland home in the early hours on Nov. 12, 2012, with her then-boyfriend Jerramy Stevens (pictured with Solo in 2013) arrested pending domestic violence charges. Stevens was released and the couple were married the following day . 'We are aware of the situation with Hope and are now gathering information,' the Reign posted on the team's Twitter feed. In 2012, she married former Seattle Seahawks tight end Jerramy Stevens. He was arrested just before their wedding for investigation of assault after a disturbance involving her, but he was not charged. Maybrown represented Stevens in that case. Solo said soon afterward that there never was an assault and that she and her new husband were happy. 'It's unfortunate what the media can do to judge before the facts are out there. It's hard to see, but it's a hard truth, and it's part of life,' she said then. 'I'm happy. I'm happily married. I would never stand for domestic violence. I've never been hit in my life.' In her last appearance for the US, Solo recorded her 71st career shutout, a 1-0 victory over France on June 14 in Tampa, Florida. She sat out the team's game against France on Thursday night in Connecticut. On Saturday, police were called the to the Kirkland home the Seattle Reign FC goalkeeper shares with her husband, former NFL player Jerramy Stevans, about 1:00am. According to a police report obtained by The Seattle Times, a male caller told 911 the 32-year-old was 'hitting people' at a family gathering. 'Officer arrived and immediately heard the sounds of the disturbance inside the residence,' the report noted. 'They entered and contacted several persons; one being Hope A Stevens (Solo) who appeared intoxicated and upset.' Authorities said Solo's 17-year-old nephew and her sister had visible injuries. 'After receiving statements of the persons involved, Officers determined that Solo was the primary aggressor and had instigated the assault,' the report said. Kirkland police Lt. Mike Murray said there was 'a big party going on at her house'. 'It was an out-of-control situation' Lt. Murray told The Times. The world-famous goalie has spoken before about her fractious family, writing in her 2012 biography they 'don't do happy endings' United States goalkeeper Hope Solo, right, makes a save on a shot by France during the second half of a women's friendly soccer match on Saturday, June 14, 2014, in Tampa, Florida . Solo was processed at the SCORE misdemeanor jail in South King County on on Saturday morning on two counts of investigation of domestic violence assault. Solo's late father, Jeffrey Solo, had two children, Terry and David, before divorcing his wife. He then remarried and had Hope and her brother, Marcus. In her 2012 biography, Solo: A Memoir Of Hope, she wrote of her tumultuous family relationships. 'My family doesn't do happy endings,' Solo said in the book. 'We do sad endings or frustrating endings or no endings at all. 'We are hardwired to expect the next interruption or disappearance or broken promise.' Solo's father was also arrested for kidnapping her and her brother when she was seven. Her parents had divorced the year prior. She has previously spoken about how her dad picked her and her brother from their home in Richland, Washington - where they lived with her mother, Judy - to go to a baseball game in a nearby town. However Jeffrey Solo continued to drive to Seattle, where the three stayed in a hotel for several days. Hope and her brother believed it was a vacation, until their father was arrested at a bank. In her professional life, Solo has played on two gold-medal winning Olympic women’s teams and appeared Dancing With The Stars. According to The New York Post, the Seattle Reign is scheduled to play on Sunday against the Western New York Flash in Rochester. 'We are aware of the situation,' US Soccer said in a statement to the paper. 'At this point, we don’t have any further comments.'","US soccer legend Hope Solo's attorney has said that she is the real victim of incident at her sister's home on Saturday .

"By . Tara Brady . A new technique does away with fillings and instead encourages teeth to repair themselves . The terrifying sound alone is enough to make most of us delay that annual check-up with the dentist. But the whirring and grinding of those dreaded drills could be nothing more than a nasty memory thanks to a tooth-rebuilding treatment that could be available within three years. A technique developed at King’s College London does away with fillings and instead encourages teeth to repair themselves. What’s more, the procedure involves no injections at all – making opening wide for the dentist a far more pain-free prospect. Tooth decay is normally removed by drilling, after which the cavity is filled with a material such as amalgam or composite resin. The new treatment, called Electrically Accelerated and Enhanced Remineralisation (EAER), accelerates the natural movement of calcium and phosphate minerals into the damaged tooth. A two-step process first prepares the damaged area of enamel, then uses a tiny electric current to push minerals into the site to be repaired. Professor Nigel Pitts, from the London university’s Dental Institute, said: ‘The way we treat teeth today is not ideal. When we repair a tooth by putting in a filling, that tooth enters a cycle of drilling and re-filling as, ultimately, each repair fails. ‘Not only is our device kinder to the patient and better for their teeth, but it’s expected to be at least as cost-effective as current dental treatments.’ As well as fighting tooth decay, the technique can also be used to whiten teeth, he said. A company, Reminova Ltd, has been set up to commercialise the research. Based in Perth, Scotland, it is now in the process of seeking private investment to develop EAER. Tooth decay is normally removed by drilling, after which the cavity is filled with a material such as amalgam or composite resin . The company is the first to emerge from a research centre at the college that was set up in January to turn innovations into new products. The rising popularity of cosmetic dental treatments has prompted a surge in the development of pioneering techniques and products. Last month, Unilever unveiled a toothpaste and serum it claims will regenerate 82 per cent of tooth enamel after just three days. Its Regenerate Enamel Science Advanced Toothpaste, costing £10, contains minerals  that effectively build a new layer of white enamel and just needs a monthly ‘boosting serum’.","A technique developed at King’s College London does away with fillings .

"By . Ray Massey . Vauxhall last night announced 550 new jobs at its two UK factories. Some 300 of the new jobs will be at the firm's Ellesmere Port factory in Cheshire taking employee numbers up to 1,900 to build the Astra. The firm's van factory in Luton will take on an extra 250 workers to build the new Vivaro van taking the workforce up to 1,450 and back to two shifts. Vauxhall has announced 550 new jobs for its two UK factories - including 250 at the firm's Luton headquarters . The jobs boost was announced by Opel-Vauxhall's executive vice president and president of parent company General Motors Europe Karl-Thomas Neumann (Monday) during a visit to Britain. He praised the motivation of the UK workforce compared to that of plants on the Continent and in the USA. 'It's an incredible turnaround. A year ago we were speculating which factory to close. Now we are announcing new jobs.' A Vauxhall spokesman said: 'As its business grows and with another new model on the horizon Vauxhall has confirmed that it will take on 550 new employees at its manufacturing sites in Ellesmere Port and Luton, the first significant new-hire programme for a decade.' He added: 'Around 300 new jobs will be secured at the Ellesmere Port plant in Cheshire. The plant currently operates on two shifts but as sales volumes build more employees are required to cope with increased output at the facility. The new jobs will be phased in over the first quarter of 2015.' In 2012, Ellesmere Port won the contract to build the next generation, all-new Astra. Production of this model begins towards the end of 2015.. The agreement runs into the next decade and secured a £125 million investment. Vauxhall's factory at the Ellesmere Port factory in Cheshire, pictured, will take on another 300 employees to help build the new Astra model . A second shift is to be added to the Luton van plant in January 2015, creating around 250 new jobs. The Luton facility builds the recently launched all-new Vivaro van and will be taking on these new employees to increase output next year. In 2011, Luton won the contract to build the new Vivaro, entailing a £185 million investment. 'This is great news for Vauxhall and for British manufacturing,” said Tim Tozer, Vauxhall’s Chairman and Managing Director. “Both of our UK manufacturing plants have won long contracts with all-new product and as the business strengthens, we now need to take on more people to build these exciting new Vauxhalls.'","Vauxhall announces 550 new jobs to be created at its two UK factories .

"By . Antonella Napoli . The Christian mother put on death row for refusing to become a Muslim has revealed that her baby girl has not been damaged after she gave birth whilst shackled to the floor. Meriam Ibrahim said that two-month-old Maya will undergo an ultrasound in the coming weeks to confirm that she will be able to walk. It had been feared that, like her father Daniel Wani, a US citizen who has muscular dystrophy, she could be in a wheelchair for the rest of her life. Scroll down for video . Heartwarming: Meriam Ibrahim said that two-month-old Maya (both pictured) will undergo an ultrasound to confirm that she will be able to walk . Waiting: Meriam Ibrahim, her husband Daniel Wani and baby Maya are pictured inside the US embassy in Khartoum where Meriam is waiting to hear when she can leave Sudan . Meriam, 27, a doctor, spoke to Italian journalist and activist Antonella Napoli who visited her and her family in the library of the US embassy in the capital Khartoum which has become their makeshift home while they wait to leave Sudan. Four camp beds have been put down in the floor and the family are being attended to by embassy staff in the cramped building. Writing exclusively for MailOnline, Miss Napoli said that Meriam and Daniel wanted to thank the public for all their support which played a huge part in getting her out of jail. Miss Napoli wrote: ‘Meriam knows that her and her family will be safe only when they will be very far from away from Sudan'. Miss Napoli is one of the few journalists to speak to Meriam in person since she was freed on June 30 after spending eight months behind bars in a women's prison in Khartoum. Meriam had been sentenced to death and 100 lashes for apostasy and adultery for marrying Daniel as they are both Christian and a court wanted her to convert to Islam. Proud: Father Daniel Wani, a U.S. citizen, from Manchester, New Hampshire, holds Maya for the first time in May after being allowed to visit to his wife, Meriam Ibrahim, who was sentenced to death for marrying him, a Christian . During her time in jail Meriam gave birth to Maya - and her son Martin, 21 months, was with her during the entire ordeal. Miss Napoli said that on her visit she found Meriam in ‘good physical and mental condition, although she’s naturally been tested by this experience’. She describes Meriam as a ‘shy girl, slight in build with perfect skin, like porcelain’ who does not speak English so Daniel, a biochemist, translates. Miss Napoli writes: ‘When I started to talk to her she was keeping her eyes down. ‘It was difficult for her to meet my gaze. Her hands were folded in her lap as if to protect herself. Her experience in the prison was shocking. ‘She knows that her and her family will be safe only when they will be very far from away from Sudan.’ Miss Napoli describes the room where the family are staying as ‘full of shelves and books’ with a large plasma screen TV to keep them entertained. They are being looked after by an embassy worker called Patricia. Support network: Meriam poses hours after her release in June with her husband, Daniel (left) and her children, Martin (on Daniel's knee) and baby Maya and all those who bravely fought for her freedom in Sudan . Secrets: The family were seized by the National Intelligence Security Services, dubbed the 'Agents of Fear' by Amnesty International, which accused them of a catalog of abuses . Miss Napoli writes: ‘Patricia tells me that Meriam is in the bathroom with Martin. Daniel is sitting in the wheelchair. For years he has been suffering from muscular dystrophy. 'I hold his hand. His eyes tell me much more than his words. His eyes are full of gratitude. I hear a cry. On the bed, behind my back, there is Maya. 'I ask Daniel if I can take his daughter in my arms. She is small, wearing a yellow and blue dress with the words ' I love ocean'. 'She has a lot of black hair, as his eyes are bright and alive. She's so beautiful. I lose myself in her eyes. In that moment Meriam comes in. 'Martin is in her arms, naked. He has just had a bath. He is smaller than I imagined. She looks lovely in her flowered dress and her long braided hair.' On her visit Miss Napoli brought gifts for the children - a teddy bear for Martin and a little white dress with blue ribbons for Maya and a silk scarf for her. Miss Napoli writes: ‘She likes it, she is happy and excited like a child. 'I ask if she is more quiet now that the doctor who visited Maya in the embassy said that she is fine and that in a few weeks Maya will have an ultrasound exam which will be able to confirm that Maya will not have problems in walking in the future. 'Meriam feared that giving birth in chains, without being able to open her legs, could have caused damage to the child. Fight for love: Daniel Wani, an American citizen, has been fighting for his wife and children's release from Sudan . 'All the family is well, now. Daniel repeats it many times. Looking at his wife and children with a loving gaze. And that love, I said to them, has allowed them to overcome this absurd story. 'Their love and the love of hundreds of thousands of people that have rallied for her freedom across the world. 'Daniel will not let me leave before thanking again for the commitment of people and media that pressed for her released.' Meriam’s journey has been a hellish rollercoaster. The day after her sentence was overturned she and her family tried to fly to South Sudan en route to the US but was accused of using false papers to make the trip. What happens next is unclear; Meriam could face an entirely new trial for the forgery allegations or the government may dismiss the case. Menacing: Meriam, her husband and children were detained by 40 National Security guards in June. Their lawyer told MailOnline at the time he didn't  know what charges they were being held on . Now adding to her woes is her half brother Al Samani Al Hadi has filed a new case against her even though he has publicly stated he wants to execute her. Meriam’s case has attracted international attention; it has been highlighted by human rights campaigners and people such as Bill and Hillary Clinton and human rights campaigner Mia Farrow. The governments of the UK, Canada and the Netherlands all called for her to be freed and US Secretary of State said he was concerned about her treatment. Miss . Napoli revealed behind the scenes the Italian government has been . working hard to get Meriam out of the Sudan having been deeply moved by . her plight. She . writes: 'Last week Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Lapo Pistelli was . in Khartoum and during his visit – the highest-level visit by a member . of the Italian Government and European Union to Sudan for nearly 3 years . – her raised the question of Meriam’s release in all of his meetings . with representatives of the Sudanese institutions. 'He discussed her case with the First Vice President, Bakri Hassan Saleh, Foreign Minister Ali Karti, and the assistant to the President, Ibrahim Ghandour. 'They all said they were willing to cooperate to reach a positive and speedy solution to the case.' Miss Napoli said that according to diplomatic sources, and in line with the Italian government’s actions over the last two months, Mr Pistelli’s visit should play a decisive part in reaching a positive outcome for Meriam. Miss Napoli added that she believes that Meriam will be on her way to the US ‘very soon’, although the Sudanese government is unpredictable and could delay her departure again.","Meriam Ibrahim, 27, gave birth to two-month-old Maya chained up in prison .

A Buffalo Bills fan who fell from the upper deck of Ralph Wilson Stadium and injured another spectator last year was found guilty of assault and reckless endangerment Tuesday after a six-member jury deliberated for about 20 minutes. The Orchard Park Town Court jury found Robert Hopkins of Buffalo guilty of both counts against him - third-degree assault and second-degree reckless endangerment - following a three-day trial. He could face up to a year in jail when he's sentenced on Sept. 11. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Robert Hopkins, who was found guilty of third-degree assault and second-degree reckless endangerment on Tuesday, is carried away by medical staff after purposefully sliding down a ramp and falling on a fan in the stadium . Surveillance footage shows Robert Hopkins sliding in the stadium . Robert Hopkins accidentally falls backwards of the ledge . Stadium video surveillance revealed that Hopkins, 29, slid partway down a railing and climbed back up to his seat several times before falling backward on his fifth slide.  He tumbled 20 to 25 feet and landed on Mark Bratcher, injuring the man's head, neck and back. Hopkins was not seriously hurt. But after the incident during the Nov. 17 Bills-New York Jets game, he lost his job in advertising and public relations and was banned from the stadium. Defense attorney Patrick Brown said,'It was an accident and it was something that he should have not done obviously, but the time he was doing it he didn't perceive the risks.' Assistant District Attorney G. Michael Drmacich responded that it was obvious Hopkins knew the risk and disregarded it. Assistant District Attorney G. Michael Drmacich said, 'It's great to have video evidence of a crime taking place, making it a lot easier as a prosecutor,' reported WGRZ. Dr. Loubert Steven Suddaby, Bratcher's neurosurgeon, testified that Bratcher, 29, had bulging discs in two places in his cervical spine and a herniated disc in his middle spine. He said if the impact had been only two inches forward, Bratcher could have been killed or left a quadriplegic. Hopkins attempts to grab onto the side of the ledge but he can't keep his grip .

"By . James  Nye . Authorities in Pennsylvania had identified the two young sisters who died in a freak accident after a falling tree landed on their moving car on Monday. Eight-year-old Ryleigh Freiwald and six-year-old Macayla Freiwald perished when the car driven by Jason Hinebaugh, 36, was crushed by the tree and careered out of control hitting a utility pole around 2.30pm. Investigators said that two young girls died of blunt force trauma to the head and witnesses to the harrowing crash recounted how their eight-month pregnant mother, Ashley Lichty, 26, burst out of the passenger side of the car after the accident screaming, 'My babies, my babies.' Sad: Mom Ashley Lichty holds Lillie Freiwald, 3, while her three older sisters, Ciara, 5, (left), Macayla, 6 and Ryleigh, 8, smile for the group selfie . Both Lichty and Hinebaugh are now in intensive care at Conemaugh Memoiral Medical Center where the girls two younger sisters, Ciara Freiwald, 5, and Lillie Freiwald, 3, are being treated for less severe injuries. Lichty, who is eight months pregnant, has not lost her child, according to Conemaugh Township Police chief Louis Barclay. 'She got out of the vehicle,' he said to WPXI. 'The driver was unconscious behind the wheel.' Paramedic Adma Trabold of Conemaugh Township EMS descrived the harrowing scene in the aftermath of the accident.

Beautiful family: Ryleigh, Macayla, Ciara and Lillie play in the woods for a family photo . 'After I arrived on the scene, it was uncontrolled chaos,' Trabold said. 'We were trying to get everything done. Once you get more resources, you're able to focus on one patient at a time. I tried to treat each patient as my family member.' Terry Ruparcic, who manages the EMS station said the accident was a '9 out of 10' on the scale of traumatic accidents he has seen. The paramedics were given the opportunity to talk to mental health counselors after the accident. Hinebaugh has been dating Lichty for about 18 months and is about eight months pregnant with his child, said a friend to WPXI. Devastating: This is the wreckage of the family car that led to the deaths of two of the four children in the backseat . Police say the male driver, a pregnant woman and the other two children were injured and taken to Conemaugh Memorial Medical Center.

"After building the slippery creation, Salamanca filmed the ride with a GoPro camera . By . Alexandra Klausner . A daredevil from Petersburgh, New York created a slip n' slide you may not want to try at home. The 300-foot-long homemade slip n' slide featuring a jump, a wall ride, and a drop-off into a river only cost Derek Salamanca $65.00 and a few minor injuries. 'First off, I only spent $65 on this,' Salamanca said. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Derek Salamanca took his go pro cam, a rool of plastic , and some cardboard and decided to film he and friends sliding down 300 foot massive slip n' slide . Down the slide Derek goes without forgetting to pose for the camera . Derek even takes the GoPro camera with him as he slides into the lake after slipping down the slide . 'It took me and my friends 40 hours,' said the DIY adventure expert. After building the slippery creation, Salamanca filmed the ride with a GoPro camera. The documented ride shows he and friends sliding through various obstacles, up walls, and dropping off into a river. At one point, Salamanca's dog even decides to take a turn at the lengthy slide. After sufficiently going down the slide a few times and ending up with a few bumps and bruises, Salamanca tells his Youtube audience of over 100,000 how he built the slide and what materials he used to create it. Derek makes a splash without getting his GoPro camera too wet . One of Derek's friends doesn't quite make it into the water off the slide . Derek continued to wet the slide so that he and his friends wouldn't get too hurt . The slide even goes uphill as shown in this photo of the elaborate creation . Derek is having fun on his slide but tells fans to proceed with caution if they want to make the obstacle on their own . After documenting his slippery journey Derek tells his Youtube fans exactly how he built the slip n' slide . Most of the materials Derek used were free cardboard and wood from a local warehouse . Yahoo News reports that the only supply Salamanca bought for the contraption was one 100 foot roll of plastic. He was able to get cardboard palettes and other items for free from warehouses that were giving them away. Salamanca also got some help from his mom who gave him rakes, shuttles, and a large plot of her land. Even though Salamanca had a fun building his projects he says that others should proceed with caution. 'Obviously, it's at your own risk,' Salamanca says. 'I don't take any responsibly for your stupidity.' If people decide to be 'stupid' he says that they can dig a deep V in the ground where they can place cardboard to stabilize the slide and give the slider speed .","The 300 foot long homemade slip n' slide .

"By . Alexandra Klausner . The Cleveland Browns football team announced today that they have reached an agreement on rookie quarterback Johnny Manziel's first contract. The four-year deal is for $8.25 million dollars including a $4,318,000 signing bonus and $6,702,625 guaranteed. It also includes a team option for a fifth year, reported Nate Ulrich of the Akron Beacon Journal after reading Spotrac's breakdown of the contract. Cleveland Browns draft pick Johnny Manziel just signed a four year contract with the NFL team . Cleveland Browns draft picks Justin Gilbert #21 and Johnny Manziel #2 are introduced by general manager Ray Farmer (L) and head coach Mike Pettine (R) during a press conference at the Browns training facility on May 9 . The former Texas A&M football star will compete against current starter Brian Hoyer in a fight to win the team's starting signal caller job. Hoyer is coming off a torn ACL last season following three starts with the Browns in 2013. The Bleacher Report writes that Manziel was projected as a top-five pick for sometime and that the Browns eventually decided he was too good to pass up so they traded No.22 for him. There is a good chance that 'Johnny Football' will be able to start playing early on in his rookie season, maybe even in week one, reports The Bleacher Report. The Cleveland Browns has been waiting for a big name like Manziel to lead their team's offense. Manziel finished almost 70 per cent of his throws during two seasons as an Aggies' starter. Johnny Manziel made headlines after this photo was taken of him partying with a giant stack of money . Johnny Manziel of the Texas A&M Aggies poses with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell during the firts round of the 2014 NFL Draft in May . He was able to achieve 63 passing touchdowns and 30 rushing touchdowns over that time period. His superior playing ability was enough for him to win the Heisman Trophy in 2012 and to gain the NFL's attention. 'This is a place I wanted to be. I didn't want to come in and just be mediocre. To have success, you need to come in and you need to do some good things. That's more what I was talking about, than coming in and dominating as a rookie. It wasn't that talk at all. It was coming in, and trying to win some games if I'm going to be here and if I get the opportunity to play,' said Manziel to WKYC following the NFL draft. Before Manziel was officially signed, there were some concerns from the team regarding his less-than average size and his behavior off the court. The Bleacher Report writes that Manziel made a name for himself for amazing plays but that it's unclear as to whether he is consistent enough to lead an NFL team's offense. Manziel also generated attention off the court  when 'drunken' pictures of him holding giant stacks of money surfaced. Despite Manziel's controversial behavior, NFL player Joe Namath said he wants him on his team. 'I'd love him on my team, let me just say that.' If Manziel plays like a star on the court he'll have less of a spotlight on his nights off during off-season. The Bleacher Report calls Manziel 'more talented than Hoyer' and says he'll get his chance to play eventually. The pressure is on for Manziel to perform well at the NFL training camp and prove that he is worthy of a leading spot on the Cleveland Browns.","The four-year deal is for $8.25 million dollars including a $4,318,000 signing bonus and $6,702,625 guaranteed .

"By . Wills Robinson . A wide-ranging investigation has been launched into Fifa's involvement in a £58million World Cup ticket-touting racket. Detectives are keen to establish whether football's global governing body were aware of deals that saw thousands of tickets sold on the black market at hugely-inflated prices. Police are trying to establish the source of the scam, but believe 'someone from Fifa' and a middleman from hospitality partners, MATCH, channelled tickets to illegitimate distributors. The firm has become the centre of the scandal after the arrest of its British director, Ray Whelan, who is now considered a 'fugitive' after fleeing his Rio de Janeiro hotel last week. Scandal: Brazilian police have said that 'someone in Fifa', based at the headquarters in Zurich (pictured) and an 'intermediary' from MATCH hospitality chanelled tickets to the black market . Fled: Ray Whelan, an executive at MATCH Hospitality, is the centre of a multi-million pound ticket-touting investigation and is now considered a 'fugitive' after fleeing from his Rio de Janeiro hotel last week . He is one of 12 suspects, along with Algerian businessmen Lamine Fofana, who have been arrested and questioned for their alleged part in the criminal conspiracy. Police are believed to have filed charges against Whelan, Fofana and 10 others. MATCH have been reported as saying that the charges against Whelan are baseless and that his arrest was illegal. Around 22,000 hours of phone calls between a 'ringleader' and the Fifa headquarters in Switzerland are said to have been intercepted by police officers and will be used as the basis of the probe. Brazilian prosecutor Marcos Kac, who is heading up the inquiry, is set to enlist the help of Interpol and a number of other foreign police forces to aid what could be the biggest investigation into illegal ticket sales in the tournament's history. He said he wanted to identify the source of the tickets and also probe the possibility that tax evasion and money laundering was involved. Kac, who exposed the touting ring, told The Sunday Times: 'This next part of the investigation will be huge. We are going to get to the bottom of it and everyone involved.' The prosecutor has also said he will look into the roles of Mexican brothers Jaime and Enrique Byrom, directors of MATCH Hospitality who also own their own company, Byrom, in Cheadle, Cheshire. Probe: The prosecutor in the inquiry is Marcos Kac who claims he wants to 'get to the bottom of it and everyone involved' The scandal has grown since the initial investigation which centred around Whelan, who is the former agent of England legend Sir Bobby Charlton. Police in Rio de Janeiro have declared him 'a fugitive' after they attempted to re-arrest him as part of the investigation. Officers arrived at the lavish Copacabana Palace hotel last week with an arrest warrant, but he was not there and police said they had CCTV footage of him leaving through a service door. He has been described as the 'facilitator' who allowed a large ring of scalpers to have access to tickets, which they re-sold at vastly inflated prices. The Copacabana Palace is also where police conducted parts of an undercover operation known as Jules Rimet — named after the former FIFA president who launched the World Cup in 1930. Police received recordings of mobile phone conversations between Whelan and Fofana, who is alleged to be the leader of the ticket touting ring, negotiating the sale of hospitality packages for £14,605 each in cash. Whelan is now said to be on the run and could face ten years in jail if he is caught, but his legal team have said his arrest was 'illegal'. MATCH were allocated about 445,000 World Cup tickets. The latest set of allegations is part of a series of scandals involving Fifa. In June, the body, headed by Sepp Blatter, faced pressure to strip Qatar of the 2022 World Cup following corruption claims. Sponsors Adidas, Visa and Sony expressed their anger after allegations emerged that the former vice president, Mohamed Bin Hammam, used bribes to secure votes for the country's bid. Fifa made £1billion from sponsorship at the previous World Cup in South Africa and relies heavily on continued advertising revenue from major firms. The governing body has said it takes a strong stance against ticket touts and will co-operate with any police investigation.

"By . Wills Robinson . The British director of a FIFA hospitality firm has become a 'fugitive' after fleeing a lavish hotel in Rio de Janeiro an hour before police were set to re-arrest him. Ray Whelan, who is at the centre of a World Cup ticket touting investigation, was caught on CCTV leaving the Copacabana Palace through a service entrance. Brazilian police have described him as the 'facilitator' of the ticketing scandal, allowing a large ring of scalpers to have access to tickets, which they re-sold at vastly inflated prices. Ray Whelan, who is at the centre of a World Cup ticket touting investigation, was caught on CCTV leaving the Copacabana Palace through a service entrance . Investigator Fabio Barucke from the Brazilian police said: 'We have security camera images of him exiting the hotel through a service door' 'Fugitive': Ray Whelan, the director of MATCH services, is said to have fled through the service entrance of the lavish Copacabana Palace an hour before Brazilian police were set to re-arrest him . Sir Bobby Charlton's former agent  was detained on Monday and questioned for nine hours after the earlier arrests of 11 people, including Algerian national Lamine Fofana. Today, Investigator Fabio Barucke from the Brazilian police said: 'We have security camera images of him exiting the hotel through a service door.' He added that police expect to broaden their investigation into ticket scalping to include football administrators. In an earlier statement, MATCH Services denied any wrongdoing by Whelan, and said he was willing to cooperate with any investigation, confident that it would exonerate him. Under Brazilian law, selling tickets for sporting events above face value is illegal. But it's a crime that normally results in a fine of about $225 and no prison sentence. However, Barucke said that he's formally requesting that a judge consider the action of Whelan and at least 11 others already arrested in the alleged scalping scheme of having formed a criminal conspiracy — which could result in significant jail time. That would 'give a shot of adrenaline' to the police investigation, Barucke said, adding that authorities had recorded about 50,000 phone calls of suspected scalpers in Rio de Janeiro, recordings that started about a month before the Cup began. Centre of probe: Brazilian police have described Whelan, pictured being taken for questioning on Monday, as the 'facilitator' of the scandal which saw tickets being sold for vastly-inflated prices . 'We've only analyzed about 25,000 of those calls,' Barucke said, adding that he's extremely confident that football officials will also be implicated. The MATCH group, which owns rights to sell World Cup hospitality packages, has acknowledged that Whelan and Algerian national Lamine Fofana discussed cash sales of final tickets for $25,000 in telephone calls wiretapped by Rio de Janeiro police — but say those were packages that included not just tickets but VIP services, hence the high price. 'The 24 hospitality packages were offered on cash basis, which is highly unusual but permitted under the various terms and conditions,' MATCH said in a statement. 'It must be noted that Mr. Whelan was not aware of the fact that MATCH Hospitality had internally blocked sales to Mr. Fofana.' Flee: A Brazilian police investigator said they have CCTV footage of Whelan leaving the hotel which is used for FIFA officials during the tournament . Barucke said in the AP interview that police recorded 900 calls between Whelan and Fofana since the World Cup began June 12 — and that virtually all of them referred to the selling of tickets. 'Raymond knew that Fofana was a scalper, he knew that he was going to resell those tickets on the black market,' Barucke said. Earlier this week, MATCH challenged police to justify the 'arbitrary and illegal' arrest of Whelan, a director of MATCH's accommodation service. He is a brother-in-law of company founders Jaime and Enrique Byrom. On Monday, Whelan was detained at the Copacabana Palace by police who seized tickets for World Cup matches. He was released early Tuesday. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Ray Whelan left the Copacabana Palace before he was set to be re-arrested .

"By . Wills Robinson . Rafael Nadal and Maria Sharapova have both crashed out of Wimbledon after the pair lost in front of a packed Centre Court today. The men's world number one lost to Australian teenager Nick Kyrgios in four sets while the women's fifth seed was beaten by Angelique Kerber, just weeks after winning the French Open in Paris. The 19-year-old Australian, who is ranked 144 in the world, condemned Nadal to  defeat, completing three miserable years at Wimbledon for the 14-time grand slam winner. The Canberra native, who is playing in his first Wimbledon, got the better of the Spaniard to book a last-eight clash with Canada's Milos Raonic. Scroll down for video . Rafael Nadal (left) and Maria Sharapova (right) are heading home from Wimbledon after the pair were both knocked out on Centre Court today . Sharapova, whose hopes of winning a second Wimbledon title in 10 years were ended by the loss,  put on a brave face and pointed out the match could have turned her way in the late stages. She also argued it was much too soon to speak of a changing of the guard at the pinnacle of the women's game. 'The grand slam champions so far this season are myself and Li Na, yet you see a younger generation that's driving through the grand slam stages, playing exceptionally against top players,' Sharapova said. Kyrgios, who was ranked world number 838 last year, admitted he gained motivation after hearing mother Norlaila give an interview back in Australia admitting Nadal was the pre-match favourite. 'I saw an interview with her saying he was too good, so that made me a bit angry and that helped!' he joked. I think I was in a bit of a zone out there, I didn't really notice the crowd that much. 'I played extraordinary tennis.I got that break in the fourth set, served really well throughout the match, and I'm really happy. It hasn't really sunk in yet. 'You've got to believe that you can win from the outset, and I always do that. He hit some unbelievable shots.' Admitting he was at a loss how to celebrate, he said: 'I didn't know what to do: I've just turned to everyone that's supported me my whole life.I didn't really know what that dance was.' There was also drama on Court One today as Serena Williams broke down on court and was forced to quit her doubles match with sister Venus after she was hit by a virus. The tearful 32-year-old held her head in her hands as she was examined by medical staff ahead of the match. The second-round doubles match against Kristina Barrois and Stefanie Voegele was put off for over 10 minutes while she sat in her sideline chair and appeared to wipe her eyes as her blood pressure was checked. After the match, she admitted she was left 'heartbroken' to have to pull out of the tournament. She said: 'I really wanted to compete, but this bug just got the best of me.' Joy: The men's world number one lost to Australian teenager Nick Kyrgios (pictured) in four sets. The 19-year-old Australian sensation completed another miserable result for Nadal, who has reached the tournament's final five times .

"By . Wills Robinson . A waiter who claims to be the son of the former Spanish king has launched a paternity suit, demanding his royal links are recognised. Alberto Sola, 58, whose adoptive parents are peasants from Catalonia, says his DNA matches that of Juan Carlos, 76, the monarch who abdicated the throne earlier this month. His mother is said to have met the former king when she was 18 in the 1950s, six years before he married Sofia of Greece and Denmark and 20 years before he took the throne. Family claims: Alberto Sola, 58, (left) says his DNA matches that of Juan Carlos, the monarch who abdicated the throne earlier this month. He has now launched a paternity suit so his heritage is recognised . Mr Sola was born under the rule of dictator Francisco Franco ruled Spain, at a time when the country was extremely conservative and stringently Catholic. It meant babies that were born out of wedlock were frowned upon. Therefore he was taken to Ibiza as an infant before he moved in with his adoptive family in Barcelona. Despite claims to royal heritage, Sola now works in the humble environment of a restaurant in the town of La Bisbal near Girona. According to The Sunday Times, he believed he had powerful links when a private helicopter arrived to pick him up during military service so he could visit his adoptive father. As a result, he began to send letters to the palace, demanding a meeting with his 'father', but he never received a reply. He told the paper: 'I've no choice now but to  put pressure on him. 'Every Spaniard has the right to know where he is from. I don't want to hurt the king or country. I wish Felipe all the best.' He got inspiration from Ingrid Saritau, who also claims the former Spanish king is her father. Ingrid says her mother Liliane Sartiau first met King Juan Carlos in 1956 in France and again in 1966 in Luxembourg where she was conceived. In 2012, she said: 'My mum told me who my father was while we were watching the TV together.' Her case is partly to blame for Spanish MPs signing legislation that would reinstate his immunity from prosecution, a right he lost when he gave up the throne to his son . Claims: Mr Sola said his mother met the king six years before he married Sofia of Greece and Denmark (right) Mr Sola believes the Spanish King, said to have bedded more than 1,500 women in a ‘Don Juan-style’ romantic career, met his birth mum during a trip to the Catalan capital in the fifties from a military academy in Zaragoza where he was studying. Barcelona-based author Pilar Eyre, made the explosive claim King Juan Carlos, 71, had an affair with Princess Diana in a book she published earlier this year. Another royal biographer, Lady Colin Campbell, has long insisted that the Princess and the King embarked on an affair while on a cruise with their spouses in August 1986. On July 2 Juan Carlos announced that he would hand over to his 46-year-old heir, Crown Prince Felipe.","Alberto Sola, 58, believes his DNA matches that of Juan Carlos .

"By . Wills Robinson . Argentina fans were dancing in the streets of Brazil last night after their side beat Holland in the semi-final of the World Cup to book a place in Sunday's final. The encounter had to be settled by penalties after both sides failed to replicate Germany's seven-goal flourish against the host nation, with the score at 0-0 after a dull 120 minutes. Sergio Romero, the South American side's goalkeeper, was the hero of the spot-kicks, stopping two penalties and leading Argentina to a 4-2 victory. Just when Brazilians thought it couldn't get any worse after Tuesday night's total humiliation in Belo Horizonte, they must now play host to a final featuring their arch-rivals.

Despite his heroics, Romero played down his part in his Argentina's victory. He did not have a shot to save in 90 minutes but made up for that in the shoot-out. 'There is no trick. It's luck. It's reality. One can go in and not go in,' the Monaco goalkeeper told reporters after the match. 'These guys do not give away anything.' He also told fans: 'Enjoy this moment, because we are going step by step and tomorrow we prepare for the final.' It was the second straight penalty shootout following a 0-0 draw for the Dutch after the quarter-final against Costa Rica had to be decided from the spot. The Netherlands started poorly with Ron Vlaar's first effort being saved. Wesley Sneijder also failed to score, giving their opponents the upper hand. Lionel Messi, Ezequiel Garay, Sergio Aguero all netted successfully for Argentina, but Maxi Rodriguez's penalty clinched the victory. In a game that was going to struggle to live up to the fireworks of last night's first semi-final, both sides shared a handful of opportunities, but neither one dangerously threatened the goal.

She stole the show earlier this year when her mother revealed her latest collection at New York Fashion Week by just wearing her hair in an adorable top bun with a bow. So it's no wonder a survey of new mothers have voted her the planet's most stylish toddler. Following in their mother's footsteps: Brooklyn, left, has been a magazine cover star, while Romeo has modelled for Burberry . In the poll carried out by Start-rite shoes, Brooklyn took second place behind his sister following his modelling debut last week. He appeared on the front cover of Man About Town magazine with a pout that would make his mother proud. Romeo, who was third in the poll, has already made steps in the modelling world after being featured in a campaign for Burberry. Victoria told The Sun last year that the children are not under any pressure to follow her and David into the showbiz world. 'I don't want to pressure them. They should be keen and reach as much as possible. But the most important thing is they are happy,' she said. 'They lead a very privileged life but they don't get everything they ask for. We always tell them how lucky they are.' Fashionable: Suri Cruise, pictured with her mother Katie, was fourth in the poll . And despite Harper always looking immaculate in pretty dresses when she's pictured out with the family, Victoria said her little girl is a real tom boy when around her brothers at home. The Beckham trio were followed in the poll by Tom Cruise and Katie Holme's daughter, Suri, and Will Smith's daughter, Willow. Suri caused a surge in demand for heels for toddlers when she was pictured in a pair at the tender age of three. Now aged seven, she's tipped to launch her own fashion range at a department store this year. Also making the top ten most stylish . celebrity children were Myleene Klass' daughter Ava, Beyonce's daughter . Blue Ivy and two of Angelina Jolie's brood - Maddox Jolie Pitt and . Shiloh Jolie Pitt. The British mothers questioned said it . was around the age of nine that they felt children started to show their . fashion independence. Fashion sense: The mothers questioned said their children started picking their own outfits from the age of three - but left to their own devices, many wanted to wear fancy dress . But some admitted their children had started to help pick out their own clothes to wear from the age of three. A third of the mothers said their children enjoy shopping so they can pick out their own outfits while a fifth have daily battles with their offspring over what they will wear. One in seven said their children always keep an eye on the latest fashions while one in ten want to wear fancy dress most days of the week - which can be a challenge on a school day. Start-rite shoes will be showcasing their latest trends for children in a catwalk show that will be streamed live on Wednesday at 1pm via www.studiotalk.tv .","Mothers name Harper Beckham most stylish celebrity child .

"By . Wills Robinson . More than 9 million soldiers died as a result of the First World War, a deadly conflict that paved the way for revolutions and major political upheaval in the 20th century. Images of victory and pride have been circulated widely since the fighting ended in 1918, but lesser known are the pictures which show how troops and civilians lived their everyday lives while the bloodshed unfolded. On the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of the Great War , the Moscow House of Photography has prepared a large-scale international project called 'The War That Ended Peace' that brings together a collaboration of images from the world’s leading museums, alongside public and private archives. The stunning photographs depict the war through the eyes of those who fought on all sides of the conflict. It includes prisoners of wars staring through the barbed wire fences of German camps, wounded soldiers with limbs amputated walking through Poland, and families attending private funerals of the fallen in France. The grainy pictures also capture soldiers, wearing their gasmasks, waiting patiently in the trenches, while others are seen running through a cloud of smoke.

"By . Steph Cockroft . Natasha Smyth, 43, from Fawley, Hampshire, fell over while carrying a young child after drinking a bottle and a half of wine . A child suffered a 'horrible' head injury after being dropped by an adult who had drunk five glasses of wine. Natasha Smyth, 43, from Fawley, Hampshire, tumbled in wet weather while holding the child, leaving it with a serious cut to the back of the head. The infant - who cannot be named for legal reasons - was also found to have bruising under the chin. Smyth initially denied being drunk when she fell. But after several police interviews, Smyth admitted drinking about one and a half bottles of wine - the equivalent of five glasses - in a pub before going to collect the child. The woman, who was said to have a 'drink problem', pleaded guilty at Southampton Magistrates' Court to being drunk in a public place with a child under the age of seven. The court heard how paramedics were called to treat the child who was left with a cut head after the fall. The infant was also found to have bruising under its chin. When police arrived, they described the woman as being ‘in drink’. Defence solicitor David Adams said Smyth had been going to counselling for her drinking since the incident. He said she felt 'huge remorse' for what had happened. Mr Adams said: 'It was a horrible injury and something Miss Smyth feels huge remorse about. Smyth pleaded guilty at Southampton Magistrates' Court, pictured above, to being drunk in a public place with a child aged under seven. She was given a conditional discharge . 'This is a lady with a drink problem who has accidentally fallen by trying to do too much in difficult weather conditions. 'She accepts responsibility for what she has done and knows to a point she has a problem.' The child received no long-standing effects following the head injury. Magistrates gave Smyth a conditional discharge.","Natasha Smyth, 43, from Fawley, Hants, went to pub before collecting child .

"By . Steph Cockroft . A mother and father, one of whom inflicted 'extremely distressing' injuries on their newborn baby, have walked free from court, because it cannot be proved which of them was responsible. Either Craig Howse or Toni Wilkinson, both 27, left their son with a fractured skull, fractured ribs and other disturbing injuries when he was just three weeks old. The two, both from Newburn, Newcastle, admitted a cruelty charge on the basis of not getting earlier medical treatment for one of the injuries. Either Toni Wilkinson or Craig Howse, both 27, from Newburn, Newcastle, inflicted horrific injuries on their three-week old child - but neither can be sentenced for the crime because prosecutors cannot be sure which one is responsible . But Newcastle Crown Court heard it could not be proved which one inflicted the injuries - and he could not sentence either parent for the injuries, purely on the basis that someone 'ought to pay'. Sentencing the pair, Judge Robert Adams said he hoped the perpetrator felt 'shame and regret' which was 'deeply felt and long term'. For the cruelty charge, he sentenced them both to a four-month jail term, suspended for 18 months, but said it would not be in the 'public interest' to send them to jail. The court heard the baby was found with a catalogue of injuries on March 21 by medics last year. The . little boy had a tear to the flesh in his mouth and skull and rib . fractures, possibly caused when he was squeezed and or dropped. The judge said: 'The photographs of the injuries suffered by the child and the description of the non-accidental injuries are extremely distressing and would be extremely distressing to anyone. 'Neither of you are to be sentenced for causing or inflicting any injury nor allowing any injury to occur. 'The perpetrator knows who he or she is and I hope that shame and regret in that person, whoever that person is, is deeply felt and long term. Judge Robert Adams at Newcastle Crown Court, pictured, said he could not sentence either parent for the injuries purely on the basis that someone 'ought to pay' 'I cannot sentence either of you on the basis someone ought to pay for those terrible, non-accidental injuries.' The judge made it clear that one of the pair was responsible for the injuries to the boy. He said: 'Both of you are the parents of the boy, who at three weeks of age had sustained a number of inflicted injuries at the hands of one or other of you. 'He suffered serious physical harm while in the care of the pair of you. The prosecution cannot say which of you two inflicted any injuries or even that many of the injuries would have been evident to the non-perpetrator parent. 'Whatever people’s views about the injuries suffered are concerned, which are clearly extremely unpleasant, you are to be sentenced only for failure to seek medical attention at an appropriate time in respect of a single injury, without knowledge of how the injury occurred.' 'The perpetrator knows who he or she is . and I hope that shame and regret in that person, whoever that person is, . is deeply felt and long term' Judge Robert Adams . The judge said the prison sentences could be suspended because there was 'absolutely no public interest' in sending either defendant to custody for a short time. Judge Adams added: 'The time you actually served would be extremely short and no doubt would be extremely difficult for both of you, in the light of the type of offences for which you fall to be sentenced.' The judge said that at the forefront of his mind while passing sentence was the 'burden and standard of proof' required in criminal cases. During the case, prosecutor Miss Clemitson told the court: 'He was three weeks of age and had, by that stage, sustained a number of inflicted injuries at the hands of one or other of these two defendants. 'He suffered serious physical harm while in the care of his parents between the three week period between birth and admission to hospital on March 21 last year.' Tom Finch, for Howse, said: 'He has shown remorse.' Anne Richardson, for Wilkinson, said: 'She has been devastated by the proceedings. Just hearing the word cruelty put her in floods of tears.'","Craig Howse or Toni Wilkinson left their son with 'distressing injuries'

"By . Wills Robinson . Prince Harry is set to receive £10million of his mother Diana's inheritance when he celebrates his 30th birthday. He faces a £4million deduction due to inheritance tax, but experts say he could slash the bill if he gives some of the money to charity. Harry, who is currently in Chile after watching England’s disappointing World Cup exit in Brazil on Tuesday, currently earns £38,847 a year as an Army captain. Legacy: Prince Harry is expected to inherit £10 million from Diana's inheritance on his 30th birthday . According to the Sunday Mirror he could limit the duty to £3.6million if he donates the cash when he receives the sum on September 15. When William received the same amount of his mother's estate two years ago, 40 per cent went was given straight to the tax man. A royal source told the paper: 'There is no way Harry would dodge the tax. 'There are few similarities between the average person and Harry and William but when it comes to tax, they also have to pay their way. 'William got hit with a hefty bill when he turned 30 and so will Harry. His aides have to work out the most tax-efficient way for him to handle the money.' Estate: The Princess (pictured with Harry in Hyde Park) left her sons £12,966,022 after an inheritance tax of £8,502,330 was deducted . The milestone means he will take control of half of a trust fund believed to be worth more than £20million. Princess Diana bequeathed the trust to the Duke of Cambridge and his brother, Prince Harry, who were 15 and 12 at the time of her death in 1997. Diana left a net estate of £12,966,022 after inheritance tax of £8,502,330 was deducted. It is widely believed that with shrewd investment the fund has almost doubled. Her estate comprised stocks and shares, jewellery, cash from her £17million divorce settlement, dresses and other personal belongings at her Kensington Palace apartment. Diana stipulated that it would be held in trust to be shared equally between her two sons, even though William will inherit income from the Duchy of Cornwall estate when he becomes Prince of Wales. In her original will, drawn up in 1993, the princess had stipulated that both princes would be entitled to their entire share of the capital on reaching 25. But details of the will were changed by a variation order granted by the High Court on Dec 19 1997 - three months after her premature death in a Paris car crash. Deduction: A royal source has said there is no way Harry would be able to avoid the duty. He visited the British embassy in Santiago, Chile, after flying from Brazil following England's exit from the World Cup .","Prince could reduce tax bill if he gives some of the money to charity .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . It's the unofficial yearbook for his graduating class. Renowned portrait photographer Michael Jang was a student at the California Institute of the Arts in the 1970s, known for its hard partying and successful graduates such as director Tim Burton and Seinfeld actor Michael Richards (aka Kramer). But before he made a name for himself, Jang kept a photographic diary of his time at 'Cal Arts', capturing the hedonism, raucous parties and self-discovery which defined the era. Now he's released the black-and-white snaps in his first-ever Instagram account, uncovering nude and drunken dancing, crowdsurfing, college campus wanderings and stolen kisses. Scroll down for video . Blast from the past: Portrait photographer Michael Jang has released a series of incredible photos he took as a student at the California Institute of the Arts in the 1970s . Epitome of cool: Michael Jang snapped pop icon David Bowie signing autographs for fans at The Beverly Hilton Hotel in 1972, the same year he released his album 'The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars' 'The pictures that you see in College are from me walking around with a camera all the time - . not for my elective specifically, but rather to keep my chops together. Like doing musical scales so to speak - to be fluid. When you do street . photography, you have to sense that picture coming, before it happens; . you have to be in the right place and time,' Jang told Vice. 'I’d . walk the halls of Cal Arts and I would hear people behind closed doors . singing, dancing, and taking breaks to unwrap their blistered feet. 'The . painters were always painting, and the photographers would pack up . their gear and do their big photo-safari weekend once a week maybe, and . then come back and spend the rest of the time doing the negatives, the . contact sheets another day, work prints another day, and that was your . week or two. 'I . thought the actual way to get better at photography was taking . pictures, not doing all the darkroom stuff. It is important your first . year, but after that...'. Jang unwittingly captured a pre-Baywatch David Hasselhoff dancing while holding a plastic cup and Seinfeld's Michael Patrick wearing a flat cap with one arm around a woman. Also featured in his collection is legendary sitar virtuoso Ravi Shankar, father of singer Norah Jones, who was then head of the Cal Arts music department, and even pop singer David Bowie who dropped into one of the college parties.

We’re . talking film here,' Jang, who was just 20 when he took the snaps, told Nerve. 'Developing negatives, making contact sheets, then serious darkroom . time making prints. Now an image taken is instantly shared on a number . of media platforms. This has to have an effect on the way people see . themselves in regards to photography... 'At . the time they were just taken without the thought of fame or financial . gain. They are a wonderful collection and it’s a privilege to be a . viewer into that world.'

"By . Steph Cockroft . A mother has released shocking pictures of her brain-damaged son fighting for his life in hospital after he was attacked during a night out in Cheltenham. Liam Malone shattered his skull on the pavement when he collapsed from the punch and was left in a coma for . three weeks. The one-punch attack even left the 26-year-old's brain so swollen that part of his skull had to be removed and placed into his stomach for 'safe-keeping' until it could be reattached again. Liam Malone, 26, was left fighting for his life after being attacked . outside a nightclub in Cheltenham. His mother Maureen has released . photos of him in intensive care to show the impact of just one punch . Now his mother Maureen Malone has released images of her son in a coma, to highlight the consequences that just one punch can have. The 52-year-old said: ‘What happened to Liam . was utterly mindless. It’s a miracle he survived and doctors told us . he’s very lucky to be alive. ‘To look at Liam now, you wouldn’t know anything is wrong, but he’ll never fully recover. ‘It . just goes to show what a single punch can do. Liam will have to suffer the consequences of that punch . for the rest of his life.’ Mr Malone had been clubbing with his younger brother Conor, 22, on June 2 last year when they got into an argument with Christopher Perrett, who bizarrely taunted Mr Malone about eating plankton. Perrett - who was jailed for 40 months for the attack - punched Mr Malone in the back of the head, leaving him to fall to the ground and shatter his skull. The young man, who suffered a bleed on the brain, had to have part of . his skull removed and put into his stomach until the swelling on his . brain was reduced and doctors could reattach it . Mr Malone was left hospitalised after being punched by Christopher . Perrett on June 2 last year. He was punched to the back of the head and . fell to the ground, shattering his skull . Mr Malone - who has had trouble speaking . since the attack - was rushed to hospital and later transferred to . Bristol's Frenchay hospital where he spent seven hours having emergency . brain surgery. It took three months for the young man to have rehabilitation and eventually be released from hospital. Ms Malone said: ‘He was in theatre for over . seven hours and the neurosurgeon told us afterwards it was touch and go . whether he was going to make it. Mrs Malone, pictured with her son Conor, left, and Liam, right, says her son will be living with the consequences of the attack for the rest of his life . ‘I was terrified of losing him. Conor and I spent the next week at his bedside, willing him to pull through.’ Mr Malone had suffered a massive bleed on his brain and surgeons removed a section of his skull to relieve pressure. It was put into his stomach until medics were able to reattach it when he began to recover.

"By . Ian Drury . and David Williams . and Daily Mail Reporter . Prime Minister David Cameron said today the conviction of a Royal Marine for murdering an injured Taliban insurgent in Afghanistan should not 'besmirch' the organisation's 'proud' history. Speaking on the steps of Downing Street to a group of serving and former Royal Marines raising funds for the Commando 999 charity, he said that yesterday all thoughts were on the 'appalling' court case, during which the marine was found guilty of executing the seriously wounded prisoner in Helmand Province two years ago. But he told them: 'That in no way represents the spirit and the history of the Royal Marines, an outfit that has one of the proudest histories of any in the world. Morale boost: David Cameron speaks to a Marine outside Downing Street today in the wake of the conviction for murder of an Afghan prisoner . Defiant: Mr Cameron told the group the conviction 'shouldn't besmirch the spirit and history' of the Marines . Praise: Mr Cameron said the Marines had left Afghanistan in 'a far better state than when we found it' Proud: The meeting was to mark  Commando 999's attempt to break the Speed March World Record by completing the 26.2 mile London marathon course in less than 4 hours and 19 minutes . 'We should not let that single incident besmirch the incredible work the Royal Marines have done, not only over decades but over centuries.' The Prime Minister said the Royal Marines 'leave the country in a far better state that when we found it', with there being 'no functioning Afghan state' when they arrived in 2001. He said: 'I wanted to say a big thank you to the Royal Marines for the incredible work you have done in Afghanistan over the last decade. 'I believe we will be able to leave that country with our heads held high.' The serviceman, a sergeant known as Marine A, was found guilty of murder following a two-week court martial and faces a mandatory life term when he is sentenced next month. Two others, known only as Marines B and C, were cleared of the same charge. Meanwhile a distinguished Royal Marines general called for leniency towards Marine A. Major General Julian Thompson, who led 3 Commando Brigade during the Falklands War, refused to condemn the marine, and told The Times that a five-year prison term would be more suitable than life imprisonment. 'It is like a member of the family who's broken the law': Major General Julian Thompson, who led 3 Commando Brigade in the Falklands War, said he 'would not condemn' the marine who was found guilty of murder . Maj Gen Thompson said the shorter prison term was more appropriate for a crime committed under the unique pressures of war. He said that 'obviously it was wrong and everyone in the Royal Marines is quite clear about that'.But he added: 'The Royal Marines are a family and it feels as though a member of the family has transgressed. 'I am sad for the man who did it, in that he probably had a moment of stupidity. I feel for him as I would my own son who might do something stupid.' He said that accepting an enemy's surrender on the battlefield was 'a very, very dangerous time', and told the MailOnline: 'I have no sympathy for the man who was killed but Marine A did the wrong thing by shooting him. Evidence: Footage captured by a camera mounted . on the helmet of a Royal Marine and played during the court martial . proceedings recorded the moment the soldier shot dead the insurgent in . an Afghan field . A foreign field: After a two-and-a-half week . trial, a seven-strong military board found Marine A guilty. His comrades - . named only as Marine B and Marine C - were cleared after nine hours of . deliberations . Recording: The footage recorded on Marine B's . helmet camera showed Marine A, a highly respected non-commissioned . officer, order his men to move the captive out of sight of cameras on a . surveillance balloon . Scene: . The prosecution said a single gun shot was fired into the heavily . injured insurgent's chest at this spot, shown in the video which has . been blocked from release in case it is used for propaganda by jihadi . websites . Audio: 'It's nothing you wouldn't do to us,' a soldier is heard saying in the recording after the shot is fired . 'But I'm not going to stand around bad-mouthing him. I won't condemn him. It is like a member of the family who has broken the law - you don't reject them, but you support them.' Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said that while the action was 'totally unforgivable', it was important to understand the sort of pressure a battle-hardened soldier could find himself under. Dismissing the argument that there should be less understanding for an experienced soldier doing such a thing, he said: 'The more times you do tours in that filthy war, the more pressure there is on you. 'We don't know what sort of pressure he was under, however cool he may have sounded on that tape and how pre-meditated it may have sounded. 'He certainly shouldn't serve any less than five years, maybe 10.' Is this the victim? Inquiries carried out in the . area of the murder have uncovered evidence that the man shot dead could have . been Abdullah Jan Agha . He said he expected the Marine to be looked after by the military community. 'He shouldn't be treated as a pariah. He should not be kicked out of the community as it were. I hope and I'm sure the Marines will support him and particularly his family through the years ahead,' he said.'I don't mean that he should be kept in the Royal Marines; what I am saying is that he should not just be rejected and flung to the wolves as it were. 'I do not mean that he's forgiven and allowed back in. What I mean is that he shouldn't just be spat on and rejected.' Marine A was convicted after footage emerged of him shooting the insurgent at close range in the centre of his chest. As the man convulsed on the ground, Marine A told him: 'There you are. Shuffle off this mortal coil, you c***. It's nothing you wouldn't do to us.' He then turned to comrades and said: 'Obviously this doesn't go anywhere, fellas. I just broke the Geneva Convention.' During the trial, the court heard the marines were on patrol in a 'kinetic' area of Afghanistan on September 15, 2011 when they discovered the insurgent lying seriously injured in a field following an attack by an Apache helicopter. Superiors were informed the man had died from wounds sustained in the gunship attack, in which 139 30mm anti-tank rounds were fired at him. But a year later, footage of the murder - taken from a camera mounted on the helmet of Marine B - was discovered on a laptop by military police investigating unrelated matters. The recording revealed a conversation between the marines before the insurgent was shot. Marine A was overheard asking 'Anyone want to give first aid to this idiot?' before Marine B replies loudly 'No'. Marine C, standing over the insurgent pointing a pistol at his head, is heard asking Marine A if he should shoot the man in the head, a request which is refused as 'that would be f****** obvious'. The marines pretend to give him first aid, he is kicked in the torso by servicemen and soon after shot by Marine A. During the trial, David Perry QC, prosecuting, told the court martial: 'It was not a killing in the heat and exercise of any armed conflict. The prosecution case is that it amounted to an execution, a field execution. Marine A told the court martial he thought the insurgent was already dead when he shot him, and said he did so out of anger, calling it a 'stupid, lack of self-control, (a) momentary lapse in my judgment'. Marine B admitted members of the patrol lied during interviews to protect their comrade. 'We all protected him by telling lies,' Marine B said. 'In my opinion, he had shot an alive, injured insurgent.' Marine A was remanded in custody to be sentenced on December 6. Marines B and C were freed and returned to normal duties.","PM rallies servicemen in speech on the steps of Downing Street .

"By . Steph Cockroft . Parents with potentially dangerous dogs are having their children taken into care while they keep their pets . Children of dog owners are being taken into care while parents keep their potentially dangerous pets at home, it has been revealed. A children's charity has called for action after it emerged that four young children were removed from their homes in just one month over fears they could be mauled by their family dogs. Three of these children are believed to be from the same home in Walsall, West Midlands, while the fourth was a baby from Bristol. Claude Knights from the charity Kidscape told The Sun: 'If dogs are dangerous they should be removed, rather than taking kids from families.' Three other children - a baby, a two-year-old and a five-year-old - were also put in care during the same month by social workers in Leicester because of the health risk posed by dog mess. The newspaper asked three councils for figures on the number of children taken into care during January because of the dangers of dogs. It comes after a series of tragedies this year in which young children have been killed by their family dogs. In February, six-day-old Eliza-Mae Mullane was killed accidentally when she was grabbed from her pram by her family’s pet dog in Pontyberem, south Wales. An inquest into Eliza-Mae's death heard the child was left alone for just 'a few moments' while her mother Sharon John, 42, saw her five-year-old son off to school from the front door. When she returned seconds later, Ms John found Eliza-Mae dead on the floor next to her pram suffering serious 'compression injuries to the skull' that a coroner said caused her 'accidental death'. In November last year, four-year-old . Lexi Branson was also killed when the family dog 'suddenly turned' on her in the lounge of her home in Mountsorrel, Leicestershire. Her . mother Jodi Hudson was forced to stab the animal in order to free her . daughter as she was shaken 'like a rag doll'. The bulldog, which was a stray called Mulan, was adopted by the family two months before the incident. Eliza-Mae Mullane, left, was just six days old when she was grabbed from her pram and killed by the family pet, while Lexi Branson, four, pictured right, was also killed by a bulldog which 'suddenly turned' on her . Earlier this year . Ava-Jayne Corless also suffered horrific injuries when an American pitbull . terrier apparently attacked her while she slept at her home in Blackburn, . Lancashire. The dog was found to be a banned pitbull-type breed and was destroyed by police. Paramedics took her to hospital but doctors were unable to save her life. That same month, a judge demanded . tougher sentences for people who keep dangerous dogs after hearing how a . pit bill terrier maimed four-year-old Carla Cutler in the street. The . young girl was riding her scooter along the pavement and was mauled by . the dog, named ‘Lucky’, outside Gospel Oak Station in Camden, north . London. Lucky’s . owner Hezron Curtis, 35, of Tufnell Park, was sentenced to just over two . years in jail at Blackfriars Crown Court. Just months before the attack the pit bull had savaged another victim Douglas Curtis while he was asleep in bed. Judge Peter Clarke QC ordered Lucky to be destroyed and banned the defendant from keeping dogs for five years. He said: ‘The message has to go out that people who have fighting dogs... that this cannot be tolerated.'","Three children from same house in West Midlands taken into care in January .

"By . Harriet Arkell . With its blazer-wearing spectators, Pimm's and strawberries, Wimbledon has long been a byword for smart English summer style. Despite attempts by players to get round the all-white dress code, the All England Club officials have been quick to clamp down on them - even coloured trim is out if it measures more than 1cm. But for those watching the action this year, it seems, different rules apply. Debenture ticket holders, who pay £50,000 for a five-year ticket, no longer have to adhere to a 'smart but casual' dress code.  Instead, pretty much anything goes - even trainers, as long as they're not too dirty. How they were: Last year, spectators at Wimbledon's Centre Court wore smart blazers, shirts and ties . How they are now: This year, spectators may wear anything apart from ripped jeans or dirty trainers . The traditional smart dress code has been relaxed for 2014, and now only 'torn jeans, running vests, dirty trainers and sports shorts' are deemed unacceptable.  Even shorts are allowed, as long as they are 'tailored'. As a result, spectators have been spotted tieless, in head-to-toe denim, on Centre Court's most exclusive, not to mention expensive, seats. One debenture ticket holder, who asked not to be named, said the relaxing of the rules had ruffled a few feathers in SW19. 'We pay a lot of money for our tickets, and getting dressed up to watch the tennis is part of the whole thing,' he said. 'It's a shame to turn up and see people in jeans and t-shirts sitting along from you.  It doesn't feel right at all, especially as they've just tightened the rules on what the players wear.' Debenture tickets are released for sale every five years, offering a Centre Court seat for every day of the tournament for a five-year period. Dressing down: Holders of £50,000 debentures tickets have a new, relaxed dress code for 2014 . Easy does it: Comedian Ricky Gervais saw no reason to dress up for his afternoon watching Andy Murray . The next batch of debentures will cover the period 2016-2021 and went on sale last month for £50,000 each.  Debenture ticket holders can transfer their tickets during the five-year period to anyone wanting them enough; according to the All England Debenture website, the most recent debenture sale price was £105,500. The loosening of the rules over debenture seats dress code comes at the same time as the introduction of tighter guidelines governing what players wear on court.  No longer can women wear bright coloured pants, as Maria Sharapova did last year. The new rules came after concerns were voiced at sponsors sneaking more colour into their players' outfits to promote their brands. Wimbledon is one of the very few major sporting tournaments not to have major advertising around the courts. Officials there appeared to be hardening, rather than relaxing, their attitude to spectators' dress.  Just two years ago, organisers issued a dress code for members of the All England Club, following concerns that sartorial standards were slipping amongst members. How times change: Mara Sharapova got away with orange knickers last year, left, but it's all white now, right . Photographs of acceptably-dressed members were included in the handbook for the first time, illustrating how to avoid the disgrace of being banned from the clubhouse. It stated: 'The dress standard for gentlemen is lounge suit or tailored jacket, shirt, tie, trousers and dress shoes. 'Ladies are expected to dress to a similar standard.' The other photographs illustrated 'unacceptable dress', and offending items included 'T-shirts, distressed jeans and trainers, bare midriffs, jeans and flip flops'. Strapless tops and shorts were banned, as were 'zipper jackets, casual or scuffed shoes, hoodies, pumps and short skirts'. Not so traditional: These spectators took inspiration from tennis balls for their unusual Wimbledon style . Members were warned: 'The Club's dress standards in the Members' Enclosure will be strictly enforced. 'To avoid any embarrassment please ensure your attire and that of your guests is appropriate.' Founded in 1877, Wimbledon has always been part of the English summer Season when, traditionally, the landed gentry would come up to London for a summer of entertainment. Other events include Chelsea Flower Show, Royal Ascot, and the Henley Regatta. No-one at the All England Club was available for comment on the new debenture dress code today. New rules were introduced this year in a bid to clamp down on sponsors sneaking in bright, branded sportswear. Now every article of clothing - including knickers - have to be white, and that means white, not cream or even off-white. The new rules state that coloured trim around the edge of clothing is out if it is more than a centimetre wide, and they apply even to caps, wristbands, socks, and bandanas. America's Serena Williams, left, and Britain's Naomi Boady, right, made sure they wore all white this year . Some players were outraged at the stricter dress code, saying that white knickers under a short white skirt would go see-through when players sweated. Former tennis star Pat Cash said some female players had to go bra-less after their coloured bras showed through their white t-shirt when they perspired, while he said men had the same problem with navy underpants.","Debenture tickets cover the most expensive Wimbledon seats for five years .

"By . Harriet Arkell . Discovery: A body has been found at the home of Cynthia Beamond, 80, who was last seen on Friday. A man and a woman now have been arrested on suspicion of murder . Police investigating the murder of a grandmother found dead at her home yesterday say her laptop, television and car are still missing and fear it could have been a burglary 'gone wrong'. Cynthia Beamond, 80, was found dead at her semi-detached home in Halesowen, West Midlands, yesterday, two days after relatives reported her missing to police. Today detectives said they had two people in custody on suspicion of murdering the pensioner, one of whom may have been known to her. But they refused to reveal more about how she had died or where the body had been concealed. And they appealed for help in finding her missing property. Detective Superintendent Mark Payne, of West Midlands police, said police wanted to trace Mrs Beamond's silver Vauxhall Astra, and urged anybody who is offered a . 24 inch John Lewis TV or a red Hewlett Packard laptop to get in touch. He added: 'Both of those items are missing from the home.  Officers are with the family who are clearly very distressed.' The detective also revealed that whoever killed Mrs Beamond went to such great lengths to conceal her body that it was not found on an initial search of her home. He said an initial search of her home . found 'forensic evidence' which prompted a second search, during which . Mrs Beamond's body was discovered. He said: 'We believe she may have known one of her attackers, but it is not a family member.' 'What is clear is whoever killed Cynthia went to significant lengths to hide her body. 'The only person who knows where the body was hidden is the murderer, and I don't want to reveal more about that while we have people in custody.' He added: 'Cynthia Beamond's body had been concealed with some care and was discovered after a meticulous forensic search of the property.' A 23-year-old woman and a 32-year-old man are being held by police on suspicion of murder. DS Payne said Mrs Beamond, a mother of two girls and grandmother of two girls, was reported missing by family members late on Friday evening. Police said one possibility they were . examining was that Mrs Beamond may have been attacked in a burglary gone . wrong. DS Payne said: 'Cynthia was a vibrant, outgoing and very friendly lady who lived life to the full.  This is a horrific offence against a vulnerable old lady who lived alone. Inquiry: A police cordon has gone up around the home of Mrs Beamond's home in a quiet street close to the M5 . Missing: Police are appealing for help finding Mrs Beamond's Vauxhall Astra, pictured, registration T419 MDA . 'We are working on the possible . theory that this was a burglary gone wrong.  But it could also be a . murder made to look like a burglary - only the murderer knows that.' Neighbours . said Mrs Beamond was a keen churchgoer who had volunteered with the . West Midlands and Warwickshire Co-workers group, which supported Mother . Theresa's work in India. One resident, who asked not to be named, said: 'However it has happened it's a real tragedy. It is truly despicable. She was an angel, the way she helped out others less fortunate than herself. 'She had two daughters, who had a child each too. You can't even imagine what they must be going through. 'If there's one person who did not deserve this, it is her. She was like a saint.' Scene: Charity worker Mrs Beamond lived at her semi-detached home in Halesowen for more than 30 years . Another . neighbour, Ernest Brasier, who has lived on the road for 12 years, . added: 'It was a tremendous shock when she went missing. 'Her car was gone and they couldn't find it.  She was a lovely woman, I didn't know her very well but she always wanted to talk when she saw you. 'I do know she did a lot of charity work - she used to go to a place where they used to help feed people. 'That was during the day, it closed up at night so it was just a place for people to go during the day time. 'This is a very quiet, very safe place.  I can't think of there ever being any crime here before.' Anyone with information on the car, the registration number of which is T419 MDA, the laptop or the television, is asked to call police on 101.

"By . David Williams . and Nick Fagge In Gyor, Hungary . Straddling a powerful motorbike in his leathers, this is the first picture of the ex-Hungarian policeman named as a suspect in the brutal murder of a former British model and friend of John Lennon at the remote animal sanctuary she ran. The family of Eva Rhodes gave the name of officer Zoltan Peter Horvath to her London inquest – claiming he had threatened to have her ‘eliminated’ – and told how he had once attacked the animal lover before beating her daughter so badly she feared she would die. But on Sunday the shaven-headed 47-year-old former officer dismissed the dead Briton’s family and their allegations, declaring : ‘Eva’s sister is just a mean b****, so is her daughter.’ Suspect: Hungarian ex-policeman Zoltan Peter . Horvath, pictured, denies murdering Eva Rhodes at the remote animal . sanctuary she ran in Gyor, north-west Hungary, despite claims from her . family . In chilling evidence to Westminster Coroner Dr Fiona Wilcox, members of Rhodes’s family alleged they believed Horvath was linked to both the death of the 65-year-old and an extensive cover-up of the killing at the sanctuary in Gyor, north-west Hungary, where her body was dismembered and set ablaze in September 2008. Speaking for the first time yesterday, there was only contempt from Horvath for Mrs Rhodes and her family, mocking them by suggesting the sanctuary – partly funded by donations from the UK and money given by Lennon’s widow Yoko Ono – had been used to run drugs and guns hidden inside dogs. ‘Of course I didn’t kill her,’ he said dismissively. ‘I was representing the law.  I cannot be linked to her death. Celebrity: Animal lover Eva Rhodes, left, was . murdered in Hungary in 2008, and found fame in the 1960s as a model and . socialite. An inquest into her death held in London recorded a verdict of unlawful killing . ‘The only reason this case hasn’t died off yet is because she was English.’ He pointed out that Csaba Augusztinyi, 33, who worked at the sanctuary, had confessed and been sentenced to 13 years behind bars for the killing. Recording a verdict of unlawful killing, Dr Wilcox had said that while she was satisfied Augusztinyi was ‘at least partly responsible’, inconsistencies in evidence supported the belief that ‘others might have been involved’. This belief is strongly held by Rhodes’s sister Judith Majlath – a Nobel peace prize winner ¬– and daughter Sophia Barta. Eva Rhodes pictured in Tuscany (left). The . 65-year-old disappeared in September 2008 from her home in Gyor, near . Budapest in Hungary. Caretaker Csaba Augusztinyi  admitted killing the . former model and socialite . Inquest: Eva Rhodes' daughter Sophia Barta (left) and Eva's sister Judith Majlath (right) at Westminster Coroner's Court during the inquest . The family has called on Scotland Yard to be allowed to investigate the death after the inquest heard of a disturbing conflict in the evidence of investigators  opening the way for Horvath to be potentially questioned by British officers. Horvath insisted: ‘I’m also sure that when the authorities want to hear my side of the story I will be properly notified. But until then I cannot take these accusations seriously.’ The inquest was told that Horvath had never been questioned about the killing and had even taken part in the police investigation. But he stressed: ‘I have been questioned about this Eva Rhodes case so many times and I have had enough of it. I just want to leave it behind me.’ He accused Mrs Rhodes of using her animal sanctuary as a cover to ‘smuggle drugs and guns’ into Hungary from Austria. Friendship: Eva Rhodes became friends John Lennon and Yoko Ono, whose cash eventually helped pay for her animal sanctuary . Beauty: Ms Rhodes was a successful model and actress before moving to Hungary to look after animals . He claimed: ‘I filed reports about Eva’s suspicious activities but my superiors did not let me investigate properly. ‘She was collecting large dogs from the west to rehabilitate them after they were neutered, she claimed, but there was no rehabilitation. ‘Instead she burned the dogs at dawn. ‘How mysterious, they always ended up dying. I was never allowed to investigate. ‘What was she hiding inside the dogs – drugs, guns?’ He said Mrs Rhodes had refused to let him search her car. The cats and dogs sanctuary was funded partly by donations from animal lovers in England and a gift from Yoko Ono . Horrific crime: Ms Rhodes was murdered at her animal sanctuary in September 2008 near Gyor, 65-miles from Budapest. Her body was dismembered and burnt . ‘I stopped Eva in the middle of the night on a back road. She had been driving without her headlights on. She was clearly drunk. There were empty champagne bottles in the car and some big dogs with her. ‘I wanted to see the dogs, whether they were alive, but instead of opening the car, she just drove off. I had to jump out of the way so I wasn’t run over. Again, I was not allowed to investigate. ‘I’m sure there is a whole lot more to this story than what has been made public. But I do not want to get involved with the case ever again.’ Horvath left the police when investigations into the death were on-going – the family claim he was ‘pensioned off’ – and he went to live in Bony, a dust-blown country village off the main truck road to Vienna, near the town of Gyor. Star: Eva Rhodes being chased by the press in London at the height of her fame in the 1960s . Following the break-up of his marriage, he moved to neighbouring Slovakia where he set up home with his girlfriend in one of the many Hungarian-speaking villages on the north side of the river Danube. The pair worked together in a hotel. While he was happy to taunt those closest to Mrs Rhodes, he said nothing about his attack on the grandmother and Ms Barta – or the court ruling against him and legal wrangling that was on-going at the time of the murder in connection with the assaults. Ms Barta, from Chelsea, west London, told the inquest how the policeman had been responsible for a ‘Rambo’ style attack on her and her mother at the sanctuary in 2002. Crime: Caretaker Csaba Augusztinyi admitted killing Mrs Rhodes and setting . fire to her body, but her daughter Judith Majlath believes that the Hungarian . authorities covered up the investigation to protect a local officer . A dispute over a rescue dog had grown, she said, so that at one point the officer had attacked her mother in the courtyard and then turned on Ms Barta when she tried to photograph the assault. She said her head was ‘smashed’ against the wall and Horvath then hit her repeatedly with his baton. 'I crumpled into a heap and he began raining blows on me with his baton - an American baton designed to break bones,’ she said. 'I turned my head and looked at his face and his eyes were that of somebody taking great pleasure in what he was doing. ‘I thought I was going to die.’ Eventually, Mrs Rhodes calmed him, she recalled, but not before he had ‘crushed like a pancake’ a grey kitten with his foot that had been beside her head.’ The remains of Eva Rhodes was found in woods near her home (pictured) It was this incident and his subsequent ‘humiliation’ in court, the family believes, that lead to an on-going feud which ended in death. Last night a furious Ms Majlath hit back at Horvath calling his comments ‘cruel and outrageous.’ ‘It shows the quality of this man that he would say such things about the dead, about a woman who was murdered, butchered and burned on his patch, the very patch he was meant to police. ‘Like others in authority in Hungary, he has questions to answer – he had damned himself, what more does he need to do to the memory of a dead woman, whose only crime was to love animals and be prepared to stand-up to him? ‘With the evidence of the inquest and now these words, surely Hungary and Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who was in London last week given a speech on European Traditional Values, can’t continue to refuse Scotland Yard and Foreign Secretary William Hague’s call for all documents relating to the case to be handed over to Britain.’ She added: ‘Scotland Yard must be called in.  The longer they delay, the more people will ask what Hungary is hiding.’ Mrs Rhodes, attracted the attention and friendship of John Lennon and Yoko Ono in the 1960s when the famous couple were looking to cast an actress in a film project.","Eva Rhodes found dead in 2008 at the animal sanctuary she ran .

"By . James  Nye . An amorous boat captain who had left the helm to have a drunken three-way sex escapade caused a minor security scare at New York's La Guardia Airport on Sunday. Craig Gallo, 51, crashed his boat into the runway lights of the busy hub after descending below deck with James Benenato, 60, and Mary Ann Belson, 60. Galo was charged by the NYPD's Harbor Unit with operating a boat under the influence and Belson was taken to hospital to be trated for a possible broken nose and jaw. Benenato suffered no physical injuries. Drunken sex smash: This is Gallo's boat - which crashed into the side of the runway lights at La Guardia Airport in New York City . The distracted threesome met in a bar in College Point, Queens and neither of the two men had ever met Belson before. Staggeringly, the boat was left impaled on the stanchion for 30 minutes before the Port Authority arrived to investigate. A spokesman for the PA Police Department admitted that security had been breached. He said if those aboard the boat had been 'terrorists with bad intentions, they could have easily succeeded. Crashed: This man is believed to be Craig Gallo - who crashed his boat on Sunday after a drunken three-way romp with a man and a woman . Before the crash: The boat at harbor in New Jersey - where Mr. Gallo lives . 'If they had hand-held rockets, they would have had plenty of time to fire at planes.' However, there were no patrols on that night because the PA Police Department has decided that evening patrols would go in a round of cost cutting measures. 'The boats were purchased with federal money. They are not being deployed 24-7 — as the public would expect them to be,' said Paul Nunziato of the PAPD union. Gallo, who lives in New Jersey and is an employee of a financial firm on Long Island was in his boat when it crashed at the end of Runway 22. Crash scene: The boat hit the runway lights at the end of runway 22 at New York City's La Guardia Airport . Indeed, police said that the three were lucky that the boat did not sink, especially as it took police 30 minutes to get to them. A spokesman for the PAPD said that before the smash, 'a consensual three-way sex endeavor was going on. 'There’s a moral here: If you’re feeling amorous aboard a boat, I suggest you drop your anchor before you drop your pants.’","Craig Gallo, 51, caused a minor security scare at the New York City airport after descending below deck with James Benenato, 60 and Mary Ann Belson, 60 .

"By . Harriet Arkell . A housewife who groomed underage boys for sex by plying them with alcohol and letting them smoke cannabis at her house was sent to prison today. Chantelle Goatley, 36, who sent one boy a Facebook message saying: 'Vodka, weed, me.  What more could you ask for?' was jailed for four-and-a-half-years after being convicted of sex and drugs offences at Reading Crown Court today. Goatley, from Newbury, Berkshire, who had claimed that the allegations made by the two boys, aged 14 and 15 at the time, were lies, was convicted of three of the five counts she faced. Jailed: Chantelle Goatley, 36, was convicted of three sex and drugs offences at Reading Crown Court today . The jury at Reading Crown Court heard that Goatley exchanged messages with one boy on Facebook, including one which said: 'You’ve got 18 bottles of Stella and loads of weed to have. xx.' Minutes later she added: 'Vodka, weed, me. What more could you ask for?' She had been accused of having sex with one boy and performing a sex act on him and on another boy, on separate occasions. However, jurors acquitted her on the two counts of engaging in sexual activity with a child. They found her guilty of allowing her premises to be used for smoking cannabis, of committing an offence with intent to commit a sexual offence and causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity between January and April last year. Prosecutor Matthew Walsh said: 'They were still children and she knew their ages. 'The address she was living at became a popular place for these boys to spend their time, particularly at weekends. 'There was alcohol ready for them to drink, which she bought. There was cannabis there for them to smoke. Goatley sent a boy a Facebook message offering a boy '18 bottles of Stella and loads of weed', jurors heard . Court: Judge Johannah Cutts QC sentenced Goatley to jail and told her to sign the Sex Offenders' Register . 'But there was more to it. This wasn’t just provision of alcohol and cannabis. 'There was a motive behind it. It was grooming, grooming these young boys... because when they were drunk or, to use the common expression, stoned, struggling to function normally, she would be in a position to take advantage. 'The prosecution case is that is what she did. She took advantage.' Goatley was sentenced by Judge Johannah Cutts QC to four years for causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity, 18 months to run concurrently for committing an offence with intent to commit a sexual offence, and six months to run consecutively for allowing cannabis to be smoked in her home. She will also have to sign on to the Sex Offenders' Register.","Chantelle Goatley, 36, from Newbury, was accused of sex and drugs offences .

"By . Louise Eccles . Elizabeth Rose, 25, who has lost an appeal to have her eggs frozen despite facing chemotherapy treatment . An artist suffering from Crohn’s disease has lost an appeal to have her eggs frozen on the NHS before she undergoes ­chemotherapy treatment. Elizabeth Rose, 25, fears that an ­‘imminent’ bone marrow transplantation and chemotherapy to treat a severe form of the disease will cause early menopause and render her infertile. Clinicians at King’s College Hospital, in south east London, applied on her behalf for funding so her eggs could be frozen. But when Thanet Clinical Commissioning Group refused to pay for the £4,000 treatment, Miss Rose took it to the High Court, claiming that its ­decision was ‘unlawful’. Miss Rose, of Margate, Kent, said she was a victim of a ‘postcode lottery’ because the treatment is available to other single women elsewhere in the UK. She accused Thanet CCG of breaking the law by not implementing NICE guidelines, introduced early last year, that egg freezing should be funded on the NHS where medical treatment could affect fertility. Mr Justice Jay dismissed her appeal, claiming Miss Rose ‘has failed to demonstrate any public law unlawfulness’. He said that NICE could not demand ‘an immediate change of policy’ when it brought in new clinical guidelines. However, he said Thanet CCG’s new policy, introduced this month, was in breach of the guidelines because it continued to refuse funding for freezing eggs. Miss Rose’s lawyer Merry Varney said an . urgent application would be made to Thanet CCG to reconsider her case . ‘within a matter of days’. Staff at King's College Hospital, in south east London, applied on Miss Rose's behalf for funding so her eggs could be frozen . Miss Rose holds a degree in fine art from London’s Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design. Since 2012, she has been too ill to work and receives disability ­allowance. She said she cannot afford to fund the egg freezing herself. Thanet CCG said it would consider the full written judgement carefully, working closely with NHS England. ‘If necessary we will review our policy on the freezing of eggs,’ said a spokesman.","Elizabeth Rose, 25, has lost an appeal to have eggs frozen on the NHS .

"By . Steph Cockroft . A couple fear they might have to leave their newborn baby in Georgia due to a delay in getting her a passport because she was born to a surrogate. Nigel and Caroline Griffiths enlisted the help of a surrogate mother after the couple tried unsuccessfully to conceive for ten years. Their 'little miracle' Grace was born in the country’s capital Tblisi on June 16. But when a backlog of applications left the Passport Office in chaos, the pair were forced to apply for an emergency travel document (ETD) to bring Grace back to the UK. 'We just want to bring her home': Nigel Griffiths, 46, from south London, pictured with daughter Grace, fears he and wife Caroline will have to leave Grace in Tblisi, Georgia, . where she was born due to passport office delays . Now the couple - who said they had meticulously followed advice about obtaining a travel document for their daughter -  have been told they face a wait of 16 weeks because of extra checks which need to be carried out in a surrogacy case. But they are also facing a race against time to apply for an order in the UK that legally recognises them as her parents. Mr Griffiths, 46, who is her biological . father, said: 'We just want to bring her home. I . have done a DNA test which proves I am her father so surely I should . just pass on my nationality? I don’t understand why it takes 16 weeks. 'We are just full of worry. It’s ridiculous, really. It’s going to be at least a month (in Georgia) that we hadn’t planned for.' Mr Griffiths, a chartered surveyor, said he and his wife were given the impression they . would be able to bring Grace home within three months at the longest. He has now returned home to Bermondsey, south London, while his 57-year-old wife, who runs a human resources consultancy, is still in Georgia with the baby. Grace was a 'little miracle' for Mr Griffiths and his wife Caroline, who unsuccessfully tried to conceive for ten years . If the situation drags on, they fear they may have to hire a nanny and leave Grace in Tblisi until the application is approved. He described the prospect of missing that deadline to register as her parents as 'unthinkable'. He said: 'This was going to be our last . chance - it was an amazing little miracle. It was amazing (when Grace . was born). I was in tears.' Mr and Mrs Griffiths decided to pursue surrogacy after years of failed attempts using IVF treatment. They chose to have the baby in Georgia because of complicated legal issues surrounding the process in the UK. They paid several thousand pounds for the service and the baby was conceived using Mr Griffiths’ sperm and a donor egg. Mr Griffiths said they had spoken to officials in the British Embassy in Tblisi several months before the birth. He said they were led to believe the application for the baby’s passport would take around six to eight weeks, or maybe 12 'at a push'. Around the time Grace was born, measures were introduced to ease the backlog of passport applications. This included allowing parents or guardians of children overseas to apply for an ETD instead of a new or renewed passport. Mr Griffiths said they went to apply for the ETD at the embassy on Friday but were advised that authorities in the UK had warned it would take 16 weeks to process. He said he had faced problems checking on the progress of the application since returning to Britain. The couple, who followed advice, had to apply for an emergency travel document after the Passport Office was left in chaos. That application has a 16-week wait due to extra tests required in surrogacy cases . He said: 'I rang the passport office on Monday and someone rang me back yesterday saying we haven’t got any application from you. 'We don’t even know if the process has been started. No one tells you anything.' The couple have written to their local MP Simon Hughes to plead for help bringing Grace home. Their letter said: 'The mistakes made are causing needless distress and worry to us both, at a time when we thought we would be experiencing the happiness of family life. 'No one would wish for there to be a negative impact on Grace because of delays caused by inaccurate advice.'","Nigel and Caroline Griffiths from south London used a surrogate in Tblisi .

"By . Lucy Waterlow . A woman who once weighed more than 25 stone is set to prove you can break unhealthy habits and change your life as takes part in the London Marathon on Sunday. Abi Wright, from Rugby, used to overindulge every day on crisps, chocolate and takeaways and could barely walk - let alone run - because of her size. But she swapped her unhealthy diet for one rich in fruit and vegetables and took up running - and hasn't looked back. From obese to athletic: Abi used to weigh 25st, left, now she's 14st lighter and a runner who completed the Royal Parks Half Marathon last October, pictured right with her medal . Keep on running: Abi, left, will take part in this Sunday's London Marathon . Now 14st lighter and tremendously fitter, she's looking forward to this weekend's 26.2mile race. Abi told MailOnline: 'I am feeling very excited but also nervous as this is a massive challenge. My friends and family will be supporting me along the route and I'm raising money for Air Ambulance which is a massive drive too.' As she prepares for Sunday's race, Abi said she hopes she can inspire other people to pull on their trainers and get fit. She said: 'I really hope people can see that hard work dedication and inner strength can get results. 'You . don't need to have surgery, in my opinion is there is only one way to lose . weight and keep it off, it's worked for me and many others. You need to . learn about getting the balance. Healthy food and exercise has enabled . me to get my life back.' Before: Abi used to feast on takeaways and was a dress size 32-34, left. Now she's a size 12-14 . While some of Sunday's runners will be constantly checking their mile splits and hoping to better their personal best time, for Abi, it will be all about finishing and putting her fat days truly behind her. She said: 'When I was at my biggest the London Marathon was never an option. This is why Sunday is so special to me, I . have worked so hard to prepare myself. Over the last few years . I have dedicated myself to turning my lifestyle round and giving my body another . chance. 'My aim for the marathon is to complete the distance, it is going to take all my inner strength I have to get round.' Abi, who is in her thirties, used to weight 25-and-a-half-stone and was a dress size 32-34. The territorial manager for a medical company admitted she had no self-control when it came to food. 'I kept gaining weight . because I couldn't take control of what I was eating. Some people may . have a pair of jeans and they know they've put on a few pounds if they . become too tight so they cut back on junk foods. But I would just get . the next size up in jeans. Fat to fit: At her heaviest, Abi never believed she'd one day be running a marathon. She's completely changed her life after taking up running . 'I tried diets but I couldn't get to grips with them, I didn't have the will power.' It was becoming an aunty to Freya, Finn, and Faron that finally gave Abi the push she needed to change her life. She explains: 'I could barely walk and I . couldn't take them swimming or run after them at the playground because . of my size. I wanted to be an active aunty so I knew I had to do . something to get my life back.' Abi started off by overhauling her diet. Multiple slices of toast at breakfast . were swapped for muesli and she replaced the fizzy drinks she used to . have regularly with water. The nightly takeaways were replaced with healthy homemade meals like fish and vegetables while she ditched chocolate and crisps for fruit when she felt peckish. Abi then started exercising by running - something she had never considered herself capable of before. 'Running was such a big challenge for . me. I was too embarrassed to be seen running on public roads so I went . to a local reservoir and ran there instead,' she revealed. 'Just taking those first . running steps was an accomplishment, it was such an unknown feeling, . like someone trying skiing for the first time. At first I struggled to run a mile but I kept pushing myself.' Inspiration: Abi let her weight creep up throughout her adult life but now she's an active aunty . Challenge: Abi can't wait to take part in this Sunday's London Marathon, cheered on by her friends and family . Her hard work paid off and the pounds fell off. She's now dropped to 11st, a dress size 12-14. As Abi got fitter, she entered races, gradually stepping up the distances so she completed a 5K, then a 10K and a half marathon. After completing the Royal Parks Half in October 2013, she said: 'If someone had told me three . years ago that I would be running a half marathon, I wouldn't have . believed them. I'm not proud of how big I was but I am proud of what I . have achieved now.' But she didn't stop there. Abi then signed up for this year's Virgin Money London Marathon and has been putting in the miles in training to prepare herself for the big day. She's done all the hours of running alone but said she couldn't have done it without the support of her friends and family or those who have followed her journey via Twitter. No longer embarrassed to be seen running, she's blogged about her training for Lunges and Lycra. For those keen to follow in her footsteps, she has the following advice: 'My top tips are set small achievable goals, make sure you have family and friends behind you. Twitter is a great motivational tool you can follow me @abiwrightonit for my daily training and motivation.'

"By . Harriet Arkell . A three year-old boy suffered serious head injuries after a music speaker fell off a Turkish hotel balcony and landed on him as he lay on a sunlounger below. Stanley Burch, from Rainham, Kent, suffered a fractured skull and bleeding to the brain after the incident at the Yasmin Resort in Bodrum. He was rushed to hospital in the resort where he underwent an emergency operation and spent ten days in intensive care before he was allowed to fly home earlier this week. 'He's a fighter': Three-year-old Stanley Burch, from Rainham, Kent, needed surgery after a speaker cut his head . Stanley is now recovering well at home in Kent, where his parents are considering legal action against package holiday organisers, Thomson Holidays. Stanley's father Mitchell Burch, 32, said: 'We were just sitting on the sunloungers when the hotel's speaker fell off the balcony and onto my son's head. 'It was a huge speaker, at least a metre high.  There was a massive cut on his head - it was horrendous.' Mr Burch, a supervisor at Thames Water, added: 'We gave statements to the police out there and we're taking action against the hotel. 'They haven't even apologised yet which I think is disgusting.' Mr Burch who lives with his partner, Stanley's mother Amy Belcher, 29, and their daughter, Rosie, five, is now concentrating on getting the little boy better. 'This was a very frightening experience but Amy and I are glad that our son is out of any immediate danger and we are all back home. Recovering: Stanley was on holiday in the Yasmin Resort in Bodrum with his sister, Rosie, five, and parents . 'We want to concentrate on Stanley and ensuring he recovers fully from his injuries.  Stanley has been amazing throughout this and he is a true fighter.' The family's solicitor, brain injury specialist Mark Gore, said it was too early to say whether Stanley had sustained permanent damage in the accident on 12 June. Mr Gore said: 'This was a nasty accident in which a young child has sustained a head injury and the full circumstances are being investigated.' He said Stanley was off nursery and would not be going back until the new school year in September. Mr Gore added it was possible that Stanley could have suffered permanent brain damage but that it was too early to be sure. He said: 'Luckily Stanley is out of hospital and he's walking around and talking. But he has suffered a serious head injury so it may well have long term consequences. 'He also has a large scar on his head from the operation to repair his fractured skull.' A spokesman for holiday company Thomson, First Choice and Thomson Cruises said: 'We can confirm that an incident took place at the Yasmin Resort in Bodrum. As a result a child was taken to hospital. 'We are working with the hotel to conduct a full investigation to understand what happened. Our resort team offered every possible support and assistance whilst the family were in resort. 'Our Welfare Team based in the UK has also been in contact with the family since their return home and they continue to offer further support.'","Stanley Burch, from Rainham, Kent, was on family holiday in Bodrum, Turkey .

"By . Jenny Hope . An NHS hospital paid £1,800  for an agency nurse to work  a single shift at its accident and emergency unit. The huge amount was for 11 hours work – equivalent to a payment of just over £163 an hour. The £1,800 total is thought to be the highest figure ever paid for a nursing shift in the NHS, although the gap between rates for NHS staffers and agency locums at every level has been widening in recent years. An unidentified nurse was paid £1,800 for one shift at the Maidstone Hospital in Kent . The extraordinary shift payment  was made for a nurse covering the  bank holiday on August 26 last year at the Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust in Kent. One staff nurse at Maidstone Hospital, who asked not to be named, said:  ‘Most of the nurses here struggle by on £25,000 a year or so. ‘That works out at about £90-£100 a day, so when you see someone coming in and doing the same job as you and getting paid what you take home in a month in just one day it makes you  sick to the stomach.’ A Freedom of Information request found the  Maidstone Trust paid out £4.7million to plug staff shortages between January and November last year, including £2.8million on agency nurses. Other data suggests the total NHS  bill for temporary nurses is set to reach £450million at the end of this financial year – a 21 per cent rise on 2011/12. At least one other trust, the Mid Staffordshire Hospitals Foundation Trust, paid almost £1,800 for a specialist nurse to work 13.5 hours in accident & emergency in December 2011. The Mid Staffordshire Hospitals Foundation Trust paid almost £1,800 for a specialist nurse to work 13.5 hours in accident & emergency in December 2011 . NHS rates for staff filling a  similar permanent post in A&E range between £25,528 and £34,189 a year. In most cases nurses are  provided by private agencies, which normally take commission of at least 20 per cent. David Prior, the chair of the Care Quality Commission, admitted that there are some hospitals in England where you would not want to go as a patient . Such agencies usually pay hourly rates of between £25 and £40 to nursing staff, but have to find more to fill empty positions on bank holidays and meet unexpected surges in demand. Agencies advertise their willingness to pay at least twice as much as full-timers receive for  nurses doing shifts at short notice, and specialist skills attract higher rates. Although Maidstone Hospital may have . paid £1,800 to get the bank holiday shift covered, it does not mean that . 80 per cent of the money automatically went to the nurse. The Royal College of Nursing said it . is up to an agency to decide how much it agrees to pay an individual for . working a shift and this may vary according to demand from its . customers.There are now more than 60 . private firms providing nursing and medical staff to the NHS. Doctors . can earn vast sums for shifts, with one agency doctor at Mid Staffs . getting £5,700 for a day’s work in 2010 and many  consultants raking in . around £3,200 for a single shift. Bosses at the Maidstone and . Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust  said the amounts being paid were too high, . but reflected the rate it had to pay to get workers to come in on public . holidays. Other costs at the trust include 21 agency doctors paid in . excess of £1,000 per shift during 2013. A spokesman for the Maidstone Trust said agency workers were drafted in at critical times, such as peaks in A&E use over bank holidays and staff sickness. A recent report by the Care Quality Commission found that the trust had high use of temporary staff in the past, but that it was improving. The Trust spokesman said: ‘We thoroughly agree that agency charges are too high and that is why we are proactively addressing this issue and have been totally transparent with the Care Quality Commission. ‘Reducing agency use will involve international recruitment, and we need an adult debate about this while the training of more doctors and nurses nationally takes effect.’ There are some hospitals in  England where you would not want to go as a patient, the head of the organisation which inspects them said yesterday. Care Quality Commission chairman David Prior said there  was a postcode lottery in standards of care, adding: ‘The quality of care in one hospital can be very different from the quality of care in another.’ He said England probably  had some of the best-led and best-run hospitals in the world, but added: ‘In those hospitals where you would not wish to go, you have a very poor damaged culture where employees feel they can’t raise concerns, where patients are not listened to.’ He said a number of hospital trusts had been identified as inadequate. ‘Barking, Havering and Redbridge is a good example,’ he told the BBC. ‘Heatherwood and Wexham Park would be another one.’ Mr Prior said many such hospitals were good in parts and added: ‘The critical thing that determines whether a hospital is good, bad or indifferent is the quality of leadership.’","Sum was paid to nurse for 11 hour shift at Maidstone Hospital, Kent .

"By . Louise Eccles . Missing: Mami Konneh Lahun, who finished 20th in the London Marathon, disappeared after the race . Sierra Leone’s fastest long-distance runner has disappeared after completing the London Marathon. Police said Mami Konneh Lahun, 24, vanished after crossing the finish line on Sunday in 21st place. The alarm was raised when she failed to return to her accommodation in Greenwich, East London, ahead of her flight home on Monday. It is thought the athlete may have fled to avoid returning to Sierra Leone. It is not uncommon for athletes from developing nations to run away during international competitions or claim asylum. During the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, two-thirds of the Sierra Leone team disappeared. Twenty-one people from the 30-strong team failed to catch their flight home. At the London 2012 Olympics, 82 athletes, coaches and officials claimed political asylum. Police admitted last year that they were still looking for 21 people who had vanished after the Games. Miss Lahun, who was nominated for Sports Personality of the Year in Sierra Leone last year, has won marathons in her own country and neighbouring Liberia. She was the first runner to represent the West African nation in the London Marathon, finishing the race in two hours and 46 minutes. Start: Miss Lahun was part of the elite women's race, pictured here sprinting at the start on Blackheath . Inquiry: The athlete was last seen after crossing the finishing line in The Mall and failed to appear at her accommodation in Greenwich .

"By . Jenny Hope . Thousands of seriously ill cancer patients could be denied treatment under changes to the way drugs are funded on the NHS. Campaigners are warning that proposals from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) will end the priority given to terminally ill patients. They estimate almost 13,000 cancer patients a year who are given life-prolonging drugs might be denied them under the new plans – with the elderly particularly vulnerable. They are urging the Government to tell Nice to approve more treatments, as has been done in Scotland. Campaigners say almost 13,000 cancer patients a year who are given life-prolonging drugs might be denied them under new plans to end the priority given to terminally ill patients - with the elderly particularly vulnerable . Nice, which decides whether new medicines are cost-effective, is changing the criteria used to determine the value to patients and society of approving drugs. Its appraisal committees will have to adopt a more ‘favourable approach’ when considering treatments for people whose conditions involve a ‘high burden’ of illness and where there is a wider impact on society. But the decision to remove ‘end of life’ criteria, which gave special consideration to the seriously ill, has raised widespread concern. Campaigners fear the change could lead to a ‘stealth cut’ in the cost threshold for approval, and the downgrading of treatment for those nearing the end of their lives. Five years ago Nice issued new guidance to allow some dying cancer patients to get costly life-extending drugs on the NHS. The new end-of-life criteria meant drugs formerly regarded as too expensive were more likely to be approved if they could extend life – usually by at least three months. Advisory bodies were told they had to ‘fully consider’ all the benefits to affected patients. The issue was raised following public criticism of Nice’s refusal to fund certain drugs for patients with terminal cancer. It came to a head in 2008,  when the watchdog issued draft advice banning patients with advanced kidney cancer from receiving four life-prolonging drugs available in most other Western countries. The drug Sutent, along with 11 others, has now been approved under the current criteria. Nearly 13,000 patients a year are benefiting from the guidelines. But campaigners claim the removal of end-of-life criteria means there is no certainty that life-extending drugs would continue to be funded. Andrew Wilson, chief executive of the Rarer Cancers Foundation, said the proposed reforms would be a ‘backward step for cancer’. He added: ‘Plans to abolish special rules for drugs used near the end of a patient’s life have been slipped out in the small print of this consultation. ‘They amount to a stealth cut for cancer and could have a devastating impact on access to life-extending drugs, with no guarantee that other changes to the rationing formula  will compensate.’ The reforms mark a shift to a system of value-based pricing that the Coalition Government pledged would allow patients to ‘access the drugs and treatments their doctors think they need’. Nice proposes a new ‘burden of illness’ criteria, described as the loss in quality and length of life, to replace the current end-of-life protocol. It says other factors such as wider social  impact, whether a new technology or drug is innovative, and non-health objectives such as reducing the impact on carers, will be taken  into account. It will do this by measuring the burden of a disease in ‘quality adjusted life years’, and comparing this with the years that people could expect to live without the condition. Experts say this could discriminate against the elderly, as they have fewer years of life left. Societal impact would look at a person’s capacity to engage with society as a result of living with the disease. Leading prostate cancer specialist Professor Jonathan Waxman said: ‘Nice is a monstrous and Kafkaesque bureaucracy that is unanswerable to the public and their doctors. ‘It grows from strength to strength and costs millions and millions of pounds more to run, money that could be usefully spent on the treatment of patients.’ Ben Osborn, Head of Pfizer Oncology UK, said ‘English and Welsh patients are being denied innovative new medicines that improve and extend lives. ‘We fear these proposals could be yet another sticking plaster solution that won’t solve that problem. ‘Government must help Nice by setting a new mandate that frees it to champion innovation for the benefit of patients. ‘Failing to act will create a two-tier health system, where patients in England are denied treatments available elsewhere in the UK.’ Ahead of publication of the draft proposals, Nice said it would not discriminate against the elderly simply because they had had a ‘fair innings’. But a spokesman said it was ‘difficult to say with certainty’ whether the changes would lead to more treatments being approved. Clive Stone with David Cameron during 2012's Olympic relay: The 66-year-old was fought Nice because it refused to approve the new drug Sutent . When grandfather Clive Stone was diagnosed with kidney cancer in 2007, he never dreamed he would spend the rest of his life fighting for the rights of patients. The former bank manager, 66, was plunged into a battle with Nice because it refused to approve the new drug Sutent. The drug rationing watchdog said it was too expensive, even though it had been shown to double survival time to 28 months. Eventually the drug was approved under end-of-life criteria, meaning people with the most severe health needs get priority. But under the proposed changes, there is no certainty that Sutent would be available on the NHS. Mr Stone, who lives near Witney, Oxfordshire, said: ‘If I hadn’t got Sutent I wouldn’t be here today, almost seven years later. ‘Those of us who campaigned, and are still campaigning, against the appalling process cancer patents have to go through to get vital drugs will carry on. ‘If restrictions get any worse more people with cancer will die earlier than they need to.’ Mr Stone, who was awarded an MBE for his services to health, successfully lobbied Prime Minister David Cameron, his local MP, to create a £200million Cancer Drugs Fund for England in 2011. The father of two, who lives alone since his wife died of breast cancer in 2011, said: ‘More than 38,000 patients have benefited, we have made a difference. ‘But I look forward to the time when very ill patients do not have to spend their precious time trying to access effective drugs which are freely available in other countries.’","Campaigners say almost 13,000 might be denied life-prolonging drugs .

"By . Harriet Arkell . Promising PR executive Faizel Vohra, 28, died after being hit by rush-hour traffic on the M6 motorway in Lancashire . A newly-married public relations worker who was worried about his marriage died after stepping into traffic on a busy motorway. Faizel Vohra, 28, had been married just three months when it emerged that a third party was involved and the relationship between him and wife, Zaheda, crumbled, an inquest into his death heard. The account manager from Preston, named in an industry list of top PRs under 30, parked his VW Golf on the hard shoulder of the M6 near his Lancashire home town before deliberately stepping in front of a lorry. He was hit by several vehicles, suffering multiple injuries, and died at the scene, Preston and East Lancashire Coroner's Court heard. When Mr Vohra's mobile phone was recovered, it contained text messages between himself and his wife which revealed a third party had been involved.  The messages indicated that their brief marriage had broken down, and there was 'a clear sense of upset'. The inquest heard that Mr Vohra, who wrote a food blog which featured pictures of him with contestants from the Great British Bake Off, was a high-flying PR executive with a bright future. The Lancaster University graduate married in November 2013 but his boss at Leyland-based MTJ Associates, Anne Jackson, noticed that by February this year his mood had changed. 'He was by nature a quiet, very respectful and very serious employee,' she told the inquest.  'But I just noticed he was a little bit more pre-occupied. She said that on 10 February, the day before his death, she had held a meeting with Mr Vohra to see if she could help him after he said he had family issues 'to sort out'. Ms Jackson added: 'He was very, very upset, physically shaking. It was out of character for him.' But she said that he did not disclose what his problem was. She said: 'I didn't want to make him any more upset. Very shortly after the meeting he picked up a call from a journalist who has asked him how his weekend was and he said ""Yeah great"", and he was back to his old self. 'I offered him more time off, and any support, but he said no. He sent an email after and said thank you for your support and kindness.' The inquest was told that at around 6pm the following day, drivers saw a man stepping out onto the M6 motorway near Preston. In a statement read to the court, wagon driver Christopher Gore, told how he swerved into another lane to avoid Mr Vohra. Mr Vohra, pictured with Great British Bake Off contestants John Waite, left, and Ryan Chong, wrote a food blog . Another truck driver, Stephen Foley, said he noticed the car with the bonnet up parked in the hard shoulder. He saw Mr Vohra make two attempts to step into the traffic before stepping out for a third time in front of Carl Swindlehurst, who was driving a lorry and trailer at 56mph. Mr Swindlehurst told the inquest: 'One minute he was on the hard shoulder, and the next in front of me. He must have moved into the lane when I was very close. There wasn't any time for me to react. 'In a HGV you can't see what is immediately in front. I remember thinking he must have got out of the way. 'He would have had time to leap out of the way. Then I heard a loud thud and I shouted out in shock.' The court heard that Mr Vohra was hit by the passenger side of the lorry before he was struck by a number of cars and another HGV. Jonathon Norris, who had been overtaking Mr Swindlehurst in his van, said that Mr Vohra, 'took two steps out in front of the car and turned towards the wagon.' General view of the M6 motorway in Lancashire where Mr Vohra was struck and killed in February this year . He added: 'He just took two steps out, I heard the bang.' Mr Vohra's Golf was examined but there was no reason for it to have been on the hard shoulder, and the hearing was told Mr Swindlehurst had 'no opportunity to avoid' the collision. PC Craig Booth said he had read recent texts between Mr and Mrs Vohra but the officer was told by Preston coroner, Simon Jones, that he was not to go into specific details. PC Booth said: 'It became clear that there was a third person involved... There is a clear sense of upset, a relationship breakdown, it's clear from the texts. A relationship breakdown between Faizel and Zaheda and a third person involved.' Recording a verdict of suicide, the coroner said: 'We have heard evidence from his employer in regards to Faizel's demeanour and in particular out-of-character behaviour the day before his death. 'He was described as ""very, very upset"" and ""physically shaking"", but unwilling to share with her what the issue was. 'There is evidence of difficulty of the relationship between him and his wife. What is clear, is that there were issues going on with his life that were causing him considerable upset.'

"By . Sarah Dean . Children should not be ordered to stand in naughty corners at school because it's an abuse of their human rights, according to academics at the University of South Australia. The common practise of excluding disruptive students from classrooms, which has been used by 85 percent of teachers in Australia in the last week, has also been called into question by professors at the University's School of Education. Dr Anna Sullivan believes that removing children from classrooms because they are not behaving 'may be a breaching of their rights'. She told MailOnline that the practice is 'not effective and is often used on kids who are already disengaged'. Excluded: Dr Anna Sullivan believes that removing children from classrooms and making them stand in naughty corners because they are not behaving 'may be a breaching of their rights' She said there are two human rights in particular that could be affected by placing children on time out - the right to dignity and the right to education. Dr Sullivan is holding a conference, called the Behaviour in Australian Schools Summit on 16 July, in which academics will come together to challenge the way teachers currently handle behaviour in classrooms with a specific focus on human rights. Dr Anna Sullivan University of South Australia is organising a conference on how teachers handle 'naughty' students in schools . She explained: 'Its intention is to be a bit provocative and ask the tough questions. We have to rethink things' 'One of the most common practices schools use is the step system,' Dr Sullivan said. The step system involves warnings against misbehaving children which escalates into time out if they don't respond. 'Increasingly we're taking kids from the learning environment. Then they disengage and don't have a clue what is happening... it's exacerbating the problem,' she explained. Dr Sullivan said she is not saying to ban things like naughty corners but says teachers shouldn't 'rely on them' as the first solution to an unruly child as they do not fix the problem. She recommends teachers use a positive approach and said that the university's research has shown the best performing schools use  engaged learning. 'It's all about prevention and how do we get the child to engage. We're not saying what schools are doing isn't great work,' she said. Asked how she would handle a child who is screaming and shouting in the classroom she said she would try to 'diffuse the situation and get back on task.' 'You need to question is it because a child has something happen at home? Do they have angers issues? Or maybe the teacher needs to work with the whole group.' The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child consists of 54 articles and is guided by four fundamental principles. It was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1989 and was ratified by Australia in December 1990 but has not yet been incorporated into Australian law. The four key principles are:1. EVERY CHILD, EVERYWHERE: Children should neither benefit nor suffer because of their race, colour, gender, language, religion, national, social or ethnic origin, or because of any political or other opinion; because of their caste, property or birth status; or because they are disabled.2. THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD: Laws and actions affecting children should put their best interests first and benefit them in the best possible way.3. SURVIVAL, DEVELOPMENT AND PROTECTION: The authorities in each country must protect children and help ensure their full development — physically, spiritually, morally and socially.4. A VOICE: Children have a right to have their say in decisions that affect them and to have their opinions taken into account. The focus on children's rights at the conference comes comes as the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child celebrates its 25th anniversary in 2014. Australia's government has committed to making sure every child in Australia has every right under each of 54 Articles in the Convention and must report every five years to the Committee on the Rights of the Child highlighting what they are doing to ensure children's rights are being met. An event listing for the conference on the University of South Australia's website said: 'This conference aims to challenge dominant thinking about behaviour and will examine approaches that respect students' human dignity, treat students fairly rather than equally, and promote humanistic and inclusive policies and practices related to behaviour.' The conference aims to be a 'catalyst for collaboration' between groups that have an interest in behaviour in schools. Professor Bruce Johnson, who will also speak at the conference, told Adelaide Now that 'some of the practices undertaken in schools from a conservative approach privilege the rights of the group over the rights of the individual'. Professor Johnson explained that he wants teachers to treat students 'fairly'. 'You build relationships with kids, you treat them fairly, you talk to them a lot, you don’t cause an escalation over minor things (and) you negotiate with them,' he said. This isn't the first time the practise of putting children in a 'naughty corner' has been called into question. In 2011, a Melbourne education and parenting consultant claimed naughty corners and time out in bedrooms 'shame' and 'humiliate' children. Kathy Walker recommends parents and teachers let the child have quiet time to calm down rather than punishing them. 'Even when this strategy is framed as a request for children to ""sit and think about what they have done and then apologise"", it is inappropriate. A child's bedroom should be a safe happy place of relaxation,' she told the Herald Sun.","Academics at the University of South Australia are holding a conference about children's human rights in schools .

"By . Associated Press . An Alaska National Guard soldier was mauled by a bear while participating in a training exercise at a military base, officials said. The female brown bear was defending her two cubs when it mauled the Alaska Army National Guard soldier on Sunday morning at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, the Alaska Dispatch News reported. The soldier's name was not immediately released. He was listed in stable condition on Sunday afternoon at the base hospital. No other details about his condition were immediately available. A bear (not pictured) attacked a soldier from the Alaska National Guard on Sunday morning as it was defending its two cubs . The soldier was participating in a land navigation exercise, according to Guard spokeswoman Maj. Candis Olmstead. The exercise involves giving soldiers compasses and maps and timing them as they make their way alone to hidden locations on the course. The soldier was going through the woods when he encountered the bear and her cubs late Sunday morning. 'He dropped to the ground, covered his head and remained still,' Olmstead said. The bear approached the soldier, swatting at him and biting him before retreating after about 30 seconds. The soldier blew a safety whistle, alerting medics stationed nearby, Olmstead said. The soldier was not armed at the time of the mauling, and Olmstead said she didn't know if he was carrying bear spray. Jessica Gamboa was mauled by a bear two months ago at the same military base in Alaska . Sunday's attack was the second mauling at the base in about two months. Jessica Gamboa was badly mauled May 18 as she jogged on a trail and encountered a bear and her two cubs. Gamboa, the wife of a soldier stationed at the base, has said she didn't scream or fight during the attack, and the bear left her bleeding in an embankment. She sustained cuts to her neck, arms and legs, a torn ear and neck fractures. She was rushed to a hospital by a soldier who was driving by when he saw her walking down the road holding both hands to her bleeding neck. It was not immediately clear whether the same bear was involved in both maulings.","A female brown bear was defending her two cubs when it mauled the Alaska Army National Guard soldier on Sunday morning .

"By . Sarah Dean . A woman who believed her cat had drowned in a flash food outside her home in Victoria's southwest four-and-a-half-years-ago was reunited with her pet this week by a woman who claimed she could no longer afford to feed him. The woman finally contacted the local council to track down the cat's real owner, Dhenai Veale, through his micro-chip - three years after she originally found Barnie and decided to keep him. Ms Veale first lost her 'beautiful' Barnie after he disappeared while playing in a gutter with her other cat in October 2009. She spent months desperately driving around her neighbourhood every night, calling out his name, in the hope of finding him. Back where he belongs: After going missing in October 2009 Barnie is finally home after a woman returned him to his real owner . Miracle: Barnie the cat has been returned to his rightful owner four-and-a-half-years after he went missing . The 30-year-old mother 'put up flyers everywhere' and 'always had that horrible feeling that he had drowned' since Barnie vanished. 'I had two cats and they were both playing in the gutter. They used to play there every morning,' she told MailOnline. 'It was on one of those days that there was a flash flood. I never saw him come out of the drain,' she recalled on Friday after being reunited with her missing pet. Ms Veale who lives in Bellbrae, on the Great Ocean Road, in Victoria southwest, only just discovered her cat has been living at a woman's home in Heidelberg - over an hour's drive away in Melbourne's northeast  - for the last three years. 'I'm not sure how far he travelled down the drain ... and I'm not sure where they found him. But they live about an hour away and said they found him three years ago,' Ms Veale explained. Amazed: 'I'm just happy to have him back,' Ms Veale, pictured here with her son Dyllon, told MailOnline. Three-year-old Dyllon wasn't even born when Barnie went missing in 2009 . Safe: The black and white cat is back at his home in Victoria with owner Dhenai Veale. He is pictured here tucking into dinner after a shower . Barnie's whereabouts remains unaccounted for from the time he went missing to the time the woman, who is in her fifties, and her daughter decided to claim him as their own pet. 'There is an 18 month time gap between when I lost him and they found him,' Ms Veale said. Ms Veale was reunited with the black and white cat after receiving a phone call from the council ranger in Heidelberg once the woman finally decided to see if the cat had a real owner. 'I was quite shocked. It was quite strange getting the voicemail to say he's been living with a family,' she said . 'They just decided they were going to get him scanned to see if he had an owner. 'I went and got him a few nights ago. She was a lovely lady, she said she had six cats and her partner had passed away and she just couldn't afford to keep them anymore so she rang the council,' a forgiving Ms Veale explained. Besotted: Barnie, seen here being checked over by the vet upon his return, is already loved by Ms Veale's son Dyllon . Check up: The vet told Ms Veale Barnie is facing dental surgery as his teeth are now in a bad condition . 'I went and got my beautiful cat and was thrilled. It's amazing,' she added. Asked what she said to the woman who took her cat, Ms Veale remarked on all of the woman's six cats. 'I just said ""oh wow that's a lot of cats"" and she just said ""yeah I couldn't feed them all"".' Ms Veale did not leave the woman empty handed, in return for giving Barnie back she gave the woman a bottle of champagne. 'I was there for about 15 minutes. I didn't want to just grab him and take him out of that enivornment. I gave her a bottle of champagne and took Barnie away with me,' she said. Ms Veale has now reunited Barnie with her other cat and her three-year-old son Dyllon who wasn't even born when Barnie went missing. Friends: Ms Veale's two cats, seen here one month before Barnie went missing, used to play together in the gutter outside her home every day . Barnie and Ms Veale's pet dog Porchis one month before Barney went missing when flash floods tore through Victoria (right) 'Today is the first day that they've been together. I wanted to wait until I'd taken Barnie to the vet and make sure he was OK. I also have a three-year-old son now so I wanted to make sure he was healthy.' And the former family member has slotted right back into Ms Veale's home as she explained 'my son absolutely loves him'. As for Barnie's health, the vet has told Ms Veale her cat is 'quite overweight' after his four-and-a-half-years away. 'We will have to put him on a strict diet and his dental is not that great. He needs surgery to clear up his mouth,' she said. Ms Veale won't be taking any action against the woman who took her cat as she believes there isn't 'much you can do'. 'They should have got him scanned when they first found him not now. But everyone is different. I'm just happy to have him back,' Ms Veale said.","Dhenai Veale's cat Barney went missing in October 2009 .

"By . Sarah Dean . A devastated homeowner is facing a $100,000 repair bill to her new property after teenagers advertised her address on Facebook, broke in and held a wild party. The 37-year-old woman had only just bought the four-bedroom house - her first family home - and was still renovating it on the day 70 teens destroyed it, breaking windows, doors and putting holes in the walls. 'It's disgusting they have damaged everything,' the mother of one, who didn't want to be named, told MailOnline from outside her wrecked home in Kambah, a suburb of Canberra. Smashed: A female new homeowner is faced with a huge $100,000 repair bill after teens caused reckless devastation to her home in Canberra . 'We just bought the house and were renovating it this week. The woman bought the property on June 2 for $452,000 as her first family home with her husband and 13-year-old son, who was not involved in the party. She is currently renting a home nearby and had been decorating her new house on Tuesday before around 70 hooligans, aged 15-18, threw a party at around 9pm and wreaked havoc throughout the house. Describing the moment she arrived at her new home to discover the destruction, she said the first thing she noticed was the seven police cars outside the house. 'There were broken windows everywhere. They took us through the house. We were just in shock,' she said. Mess: The hooligans sprayed ketchup over the walls in the house on the same day that the walls had been newly painted . Smashed: There is smashed glass everywhere and all of the four bedrooms have been destroyed, with cabinets and curtains left strewn on the floor . Spotless: The house, seen here in photos from the estate agent's website, only needed minor decoration updates when the family bought it and now it is ruined . The family were hoping to move in next week and now have to wait for their insurance company to fix the $100,000 worth of estimated damage. 'Every single one of the rooms is wrecked. Every wall and every window is smashed. There is paint thrown on the deck, it's not pretty,' she said. The woman described how there was alcohol left scattered around the house, including 'cider, beer and bourbon' and 'glass everywhere'. She also said there was 'tomato sauce sprayed over the walls'. Kicked in: Every single wall in the Canberra house now has holes in it since the 70 teenagers tore through the property on Tuesday night . Unrecognisable: The family's new home will now take months of repairs before they can move in. The kitchen units were torn and wires exposed . The woman was shocked to find smashed glass everywhere when police called her to explain there had been a party at her house . The woman described how there was alcohol left scattered around the house, including 'cider, beer and bourbon' and 'glass everywhere'. Tomato sauce was on the floor . 'We only bought the sauce yesterday as we had lunch in the house after we had been painting,' she explained, highlighting how her family's hardwork has been ruined. The woman has no idea who the teens who threw the party are and said she was told by police it was organised on Facebook. She believes the party-goers knew the house was empty after spotting a 'sold' sign outside in recent weeks. 'All the people had scattered when we got here at around 9.30pm,' she said. She urged those responsible to have a 'slight conscious and come forward'. The 37-year-old woman, who does not wish to be named, exchanged on the property on June 2 for $452,000 as her first family home . Devastation: A huge hole was kicked in the toilet door and the bathroom window was also smashed in . Describing the moment she arrived at her new home to discover the destruction the woman said the first thing she noticed was the seven police cars outside the house . Windows were broken, doors pulled off, walls kicked in, light fittings smashed and property in the backyard was damaged, according to ACT police, adding the damage was a 'wanton display of senseless vandalism'. When officers arrived at the property just after 9pm on Tuesday they saw numerous cars parked on the street and a large number of teens fleeing the area. Police are also urging the teens to turn themselves in. The vehicle registrations of several fleeing cars were noted and will be followed up on, police say. 'It would be better for them to come forward than wait for police to come knock on their door,' Sergeant Mark Rowswell said. Pushed over: The teens new the house was empty because of the 'sold sign' outside the house which had been there since June . Destroyed: The house had only just been bought when teenagers caused $100,000 of damage. Police are urging the teens to turn themselves in . Before: Photos of the home on a real estate website before it was sold to its new owner show it in a much better condition . When it was clean and tidy: One of the four bedroom's ensuite bathrooms and one of the bedrooms before the old family moved out .","The house in Kambah, a suburb of Canberra, was destroyed on Tuesday .

"By . Sarah Dean . The former child actress, who exposed her Hey Dad! co-star Robert Hughes of his child sex abuse, is moving on from her home in Texas, USA after urging other victims to come forward against celebrity perpetrators of sex crimes. Sarah Monahan put the San Antonio house she shares with her American husband, Matt Morris, on the market almost a month after Hughes was jailed for at least six years for 10 child sex offences. And last week, she urged other abuse victims to come forward against celebrity perpetrators of sex crimes, in the wake of Rolf Harris being found guilty of indecently assaulting four girls in the UK. The brave ex-actress first spoke out about Hughes in March 2010, when in an interview with Woman's Day magazine she revealed that she was sexually abused on the set of Hey Dad! sometime between 1987 to 1994. Ms Monahan played schoolgirl Jenny Kelly on the sitcom from the age six. Scroll down for video . Moving on: Sarah Monahan spoke out about actor Robert Hughes who abused her on the set of Hey Dad! Convicted: Rolf Harris (left) has been found guilty of of indecently assaulting four girls in the UK. Robert Hughes (right) was sentenced on May 16 to a maximum 10 years nine months with a non parole period of six years for the child sex offences he committed between 1983 and 1991 . The Australian, now 37, is advertising the property on her website. 'It's been a wonderful home for us. I've actually lived there longer than any other house,' she wrote. 'We threw amazing parties there, it's perfect for entertaining. We're sad to leave such a beautiful home, but we know someone else will enjoy it as much as we did,' Ms Monahan, who was born in Sydney and met her husband in Brisbane, added. Hughes, 65, was sentenced on May 16 to a maximum 10 years nine months with a non parole period of six years for the child sex offences he committed between 1983 and 1991. Speaking out last week after Harris was found guilty of indecently assaulting four girls in the UK, she said: 'I know there's several people in Australia who are wondering whether to speak up about others in the industry. You don't have to go public like I did, but please go to the police.' Predator on the set: Judge Peter Zahra said Robert Hughes wandered naked among Hey Dad cast members (above) and that he placed his hand on the bottom of child star Sarah Monahan (right), exposed his penis to her and after one episode grabbed and touched her intimately while pretending to tickle her . 'Let's keep speaking up about these unspeakable acts. Let's teach these predators that they are no longer untouchable. 'When I went public four years ago, it was still taboo to point the finger at a celebrity for having committed a sex crime,' she said. Describing the house which she hopes to sell now that she and her husband have relocated to be closer to her job, she said: 'The house is in the city of Windcrest. It has it's own police and fire departments, with an average response time of 90 seconds. – yep, we know from experience.' Ms Monahan and her husband are making a fresh start away from their 2,400 square foot house in a much smaller home after she became 'fascinated with the tiny house' movement, which advocates living simply in small homes. American home: Ms Monahan and her husband are making a fresh start away from their 2,400 sqare foot house in Texas, USA . 'It's been a wonderful home for us': Writing about the house she is leaving behind, Ms Monahan said she ensured it had an Australian element with a salt water pool . The tiny house movement is a return to houses less than 1,000 square feet, and Monahan has bought one with wheels - similar to an RV - which is built to last as long as traditional homes. Writing about the house she is leaving behind, she said she had ensured it had an Australian element to it despite being located in Texas, USA. 'We changed the pool equipment and now have a salt water pool. I really missed salt water pools from Australia, so Matt upgraded for me. It’s 12,000 gallons of backyard bliss,' she said. When Hughes was sentenced before a packed gallery at the Sydney District Court, Judge Peter Zahra said he had not expressed remorse.

Hughes (left), pictured arriving at Downing Centre Local Court in March, was convicted of 10 child sex offences. Ms Monahan (right) starred as his young on-screen daughter, Jenny . 'His conduct continued over 20 years. [Even] after he was questioned by police in 1986 it continued,' he said. 'The offender took advantage of when he was with victims in social settings in his home or at victims' homes. 'He lacks insight into his offending and he is unlikely to access treatment programs.' Ms Monahan reacted to the news by saying she is 'happy' and that she hopes Hughes now 'realises he's a bad man' Judge Zahra said he had considered the 'substantial effect' of Hughes conduct on his victims who now suffered from constant fear, eating disorders and who lacked the ability to lead normal lives.","Sarah Monahan exposed her on-screen father Robert Hughes' sex abuse .

And his left leg and fingers on one hand have now been amputated due to the severity of his burns. But Mr Manning – a bull-riding farmer from near Dubbo, NSW - has refused to let the crash dampen his spirits and has stunned doctors with his incredibly quick recovery. Miracle man: Jamie Manning, with his wife Karen, has amazed doctors with his progress since he was involved in an horrific car crash in March which left him with terrible burns . Speaking to the MailOnline from Sydney on his first weekend out of hospital in 14 weeks, Mr Manning said: 'People say it was bad luck but my wife Karen and I both look at it as the luckiest day of my life. I could have been at the side of the road for an hour before I was found and burned to death.' He said he is 'taking that positive out of everything' and is not the type of person to 'sit in the corner and sulk'. The crash happened at about 6pm on March 27 during a car journey that Mr Manning used to take every day. But on that day, it changed his life and has led to an incredible survival story which has left doctors ‘amazed’. More... Swimmer mauled by 'Great White' shark at popular southern California beach after the beast escaped from a fisherman . He was only 3km from his house, along the road that he lived on with his family, when he swerved to avoid a truck that was coming round the corner. 'I'd been at work and had a big day. I was heading home when I got a phone call from a mate to give him a hand, so I was driving there when it happened. 'The last thing I remember is driving round the corner and a truck coming on my side of the road and I moved to give it more space,' Jamie said. His car crashed and burst into flames. Jamie was found 'almost straight away' after the crash as there was a car driving behind him. Fight for survival: Jamie suffered 40 per cent burns in the accident and had to have a leg and the fingers on one hand amputated due to the severity of the injuries . High pain threshold: Jamie is a former professional bull rider and he said that the experience had helped with his quick recovery . But, it was 20 minutes before anyone was able to pull him out of the car - a 2000 Ford Falcon ute - because his leg was trapped in the seatbelt. First an elderly man tried to get him out; he had to run to the nearest house to get help. The neighbour couldn’t rescue Jamie either, so they went to the next house along and found a man who was about 120 kilograms who managed to finally free Jamie from the burning wreckage. 'I can’t imagine how brave you have to be to pull someone out of a car that is about to explode and put your own life on the line,’ Jamie’s wife Karen said. And Jamie joked: 'I bought them a pocket knife for next time.' Karen had the shock of her life after getting a 'bad gut feeling' when Jamie was late home from work. She jumped into her car after a friend had phoned and told her there were fire engines and an ambulance going down her road. She was devastated to find Jamie's burning car, believing for a moment that he was still trapped inside it. 'I thought he was dead, I broke down and sat on the road,' Karen said. 'Then a fella that was there said he’d already gone in the ambulance.’ Jamie doesn’t remember much about the crash or the past three months in hospital because of his bleeding on the brain and has only now started to get his memory back within the last two weeks. Karen said while Jamie was in a coma for about six weeks the doctors tried to ‘prepare her for the worst’. ‘I always stayed pretty positive but they were always unsure about is head injuries. I was confident he would be fine.’ Progress: The bull rider was not meant to be out of hospital before Christmas but, with the support of Karen, he can soon be a day patient . When he woke up from his coma, Karen said it took Jamie weeks before he became aware of where he was and she was constantly repeating what had happened so that he understood. ‘Every hour he would need to me to remind him of the conversation, just because of the amount of drugs and the head injuries he had.’ A thankful Jamie added: ‘There wasn’t one moment she doubted I’d come good.’ Jamie and Karen have been together for 21 years after meeting when they were 18 at Tocal Agricultural College, and Karen has spent her every waking hour at the hospital – even relocating their sons to Sydney, with the help of distance education, so they can be together. ‘Karen was by my side from day one. She was there when I woke up, she didn’t leave my side. She’s a very strong woman,’ Jamie said. ‘She told me about when she came across the crash and the car and I felt bad for putting her through that,’ he added. Karen said their children Jedd, 12, Braydon, 10 and Lori, 5, have ‘found it a bit tough as they are country boys and aren’t used to running around in a city with concrete and people everywhere’. What is almost even more remarkable than Jamie’s survival story is his incredibly positive outlook on life. Talking about how things will be different for him now, the burns victim explained: ‘I know it’s going to change my life but I know we’re going to have a happy life.’ Today it takes Jamie about two-and-a-half hours to get ready in the morning as he has to massage his burns. ‘It will take 18 months to two years for the skin to stop contracting… you get lines in the skin you have to massage that all out,’ he explained. His proud wife added: ‘The nurses come in to say it’s time to do something and he’s already done it.’ The couple hope Jamie’s staggeringly quick recovery means he can soon be a day patient at the Graythwaite Rehabilitation Centre in Sydney’s north-west – despite doctors originally claiming he wouldn’t be out of hospital before Christmas. ‘The doctors are pretty amazed. I think it’s the support from my wife and community that’s helped. ‘In rehab they are at a bit of loss at what they can still do for me,’ he joked. However, Jamie does still need to have half a dozen operations for his eyes and face. Devoted: Jamie and Karen met at Tocal Agricultural College, have been together for 21 years and have three sons . ‘I can’t shut my eyelids as they are burnt pretty badly. They need to do more skin grafts,’ he explained. Karen said it’s ‘probably harder’ for her to see Jamie sleeping with his eyes open than it is for him to get to sleep. ‘When he first came round from the coma I only knew he was asleep if his eyes were rolled back in his head,’ she said. Since the accident, Jamie said he’s become ‘more of a family man’ and Karen has noticed how family time is now more ‘precious’ to him. But the former horse racer, who owns about a dozen horses, is keen to get back on his horse ‘as soon as possible’... although he admitted he might have to take it slower now there are ‘two steel rods’ in his back. The former professional bull-rider, who broke a Guinness World Record for the longest time on a mechanical bull with two minutes and four seconds, believes he also has a high-pain threshold to thank for his quick recovery. ‘I used to ride bulls and get knocks from that and then go to work Monday,’ he explained. Jamie's local community has set up the Jamie Manning Recovery Auction and in May raised $65,000 to help cover the costs of modifying Jamie's home to make it wheelchair friendly. Meanwhile, Jamie has his eye on getting a quad bike so he can drive around his farm 'to check on stock and check fences'. 'I'm not going to sit in the house and do nothing,' he said.","Jamie Manning's car burst into flames when he crashed on March 27 .

"By . Sarah Dean . Former Socceroo Robbie Slater has hit out at his ex teammate Craig Foster on Twitter, claiming the sportsman turned presenter has 'ruined the World Cup'. Foster, who has a long-running feud with Fox Sports pundit Slater, fired back telling him 'your thoughts are excretions'. The 45-year-old had just commentated on Australia's 3-0 loss to Spain on Tuesday morning, when Slater slammed him. Fighting: Former Soccerroo teammates Robbie Slater (left) and Craig Foster (right) have had another blue . Foster, who is helping to present SBS's World Cup coverage from Brazil, called out to the Socceroos' fans to get behind the national team, via Twitter. 'Message to everyone that loved Roos is get into a stadium, become A-League member, join the mission, throw your support behind the dream,' he said. But while he presumably intended the tweet to be well received by his 40,000 followers, Slater piped up: '@FTSAUS @Craig_Foster learn how to co commentate! You ruined the World Cup my son! A bit harsh but constructive!' Fired up, Foster replied: '@RobbieSlater17 Rob, your thoughts are excretions. I long ago tired of your intellectual bowel movements. Bit harsh, eminently constructive.' Their Twitter spat started when SBS commentator Craig Foster tweeted for Australian's to support their national soccer team . Robbie Slater hit out at Foster claiming he had 'ruined the World Cup' Foster fired back, saying the thinks Robbie's 'thoughts are excretions' This isn't the first time the soccer stars have had a blue. Their disdain for each other reportedly first began during the 1997 Confederations Cup in Saudi Arabia when they got into a pay dispute. Slater claimed Foster wanted more prize money. And in January 2012, the SBS Chief Football Analyst was labelled a racist by the ex-Blackburn Rovers player. Former Crystal Palace player Foster questioned Melbourne Victory's decision to hire Northern Irishman Jim Magilton, while writing in a newspaper article. Slater responded by calling him a 'racist' and a hypocrite. Dispute: The commentators fell out after the Australia v Spain game during the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil on Tuesday. In this picture David Silva of Spain controls the ball against Matthew Spiranovic of Australia . He raged on Twitter: 'OK here goes. I am sick of the continual attacks and in my opinion racist comments from @Craig_Foster on British people his article in [...] [t]odays sun herald [sic] in my opinion is a racist column and it is beyond me how he continually gets away with these vile articles.' Foster retired from football in 2003 after earning 29 caps with the Socceroos. Meanwhile, Slater, who was born in England and migrated with his family to Australia, won 44 caps for the Australian national team. His final appearance for the country was against Saudi Arabia in the 1997 Confederations Cup, where the pair fell out over the second place winnings. Australia came runners-up to Brazil during the Cup.","Craig Foster is commentating on the World Cup from Brazil for SBS .

"By . Sarah Dean . Fifty years since the Fab Four made their one and only visit to Australia, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr were back in Sydney on Saturday. The Beatles' iconic Abbey Road album cover was recreated in front of Sydney's Opera House by waxwork models, over 10,553 miles from where the band originally posed in London, to celebrate their arrival Down Under. Dressed in swinging sixties garb, the models were placed on a zebra crossing in Sydney harbour - instead of outside Abbey Road Studios. Look who's back: Waxwork figures of the Beatles posed in front of Sydney's Harbour Bridge and Opera House on Saturday . Iconic: The Beatles' Abbey Road album cover, featuring the Fab Four walking across a zebra crossing outside Abbey Road Studios, is one of the most famous and imitated images in the history of music . Abbey Road, released in 1969, was the eleventh studio album by the Beatles and remains their best-selling record. The waxworks of the world's favourite band have just arrived in Sydney from Tokoyo and will be part of an interactive exhibit at Madame Tussauds in Darling Harbour, in the city centre. Madame Tussauds first held sittings with The Beatles in 1964 - the same year that they toured Australia. Of course what was lacking when the waxworks touched down in Sydney on Saturday was the hysterical Beatlemania that occurred when the real Liverpudlian lads arrived in Sydney on 11 June 1964. Long time: It has been 50 years since the band really visited Australia on their one and only tour Down Under . Swinging sixties: Madame Tussauds first held sittings with The Beatles in 1964 - the same year that they toured Australia . The Beatles began their Australian tour in Adelaide on 12 June 1964, when 300,000 people lined the streets from the airport to the city to welcome them. Ringo Starr was hospitalised in the UK when it kicked off so Jimmie Nicol was temporarily hired to stand in as a drummer until Ringo rejoined the group in Melbourne. By the time they were back in Sydney on 18 June, it was Paul McCartney's 22nd birthday, and after the concert a party was held back at the Chevron Hotel. Abbey Road now: Tourists cross the zebra crossing made famous by the Beatles . Beatlemania: On 12 June 1964 a huge crowd gathered outside the Town Hall in King William Street, to welcome the Beatles to Adelaide . Last week, one ardent fan, now 64, revealed they still have a piece of cake from the musician's 22nd birthday bash. The Beatles were not only on their way to becoming the biggest rock band in 1964, they were also the first ever to be featured at Madame Tussauds. For the new touring figures, Madame Tussauds have used a combination of the sitting measurements and additional image research including a number of image references from the 1969 Abbey Road photo shoot. Biggest fans? Hundreds of screaming women met the Beatles with banners and photos in Australia in 1964 . The style of the figures is based on their styling around the time, not long before the band's dissolution in 1970. 'Not only can guests interact with the famous four, but they can also recreate a moment of Beatles history in their very own Abbey Road album cover,' Quinn Clarke, general manager of Madame Tussauds Sydney, said. The waxworks will be in Sydney until September, when they will be flown to San Francisco for the last leg of their tour.

"By . Sarah Dean . Crime writer and model Tara Moss has claimed the 'drug affected' stranger who punched her in Sydney's CBD on Wednesday did not 'target' her specifically. And she has thanked her Twitter followers for their support after she was left shaken and bruised by the random attack. 'As some of you would now know, my afternoon took an unusual turn,' Ms Moss wrote on her official website. Scroll down for video . Tara Moss, seen here in Sydney in 2011, has claimed she was the victim of a random attack in the city's CBD on Wednesday . 'I was punched by a stranger while crossing the road alone on Market Street and Pitt Street in Sydney CBD around lunchtime, near Hyde Park. 'The man who attacked me appeared to be highly agitated and drug affected or mentally unwell, and the attack was brief, random and completely unexpected. 'I do not believe I was specifically targeted for any reason,' Ms Moss said. The incident took place on busy Market Street, near Hyde Park, around lunchtime. Soon after the assault, Moss took to twitter to express her shock and alert fans. The 40-year-old wrote on Twitter that she was bruised after being 'hit by a man in the street'. Ms Moss visited clothes store Jacqui E, who she is a brand ambassador for, before the attack. She posted this picture of herself modelling on Instagram, writing: 'Just freaking out my fellow Jacqui E shoppers at the Sydney City store. As you do.' She approached a police officer on George Street about the incident but did not want to report the attack, police say. 'Was just hit by a man in the street. He's on Market St in dark clothing headed toward Hyde Park. Slim/white. Beware. Suspect drug affected,' Ms Moss tweeted. The model described how the man was wearing 'dark casual clothing, perhaps 6ft, travelling alone'. She added: 'Don't approach as I suspect he is drug affected.' Ms Moss said: 'Have spoken to police who will patrol the area - he fits the desc of a known perp. In the meantime be careful in Hyde Park, CBD area, folks. 'I'm bruising up but fine. Random attack. Police are looking for him. In the meantime be careful in Hyde Park/CBD area.' Tara Moss warned her Twitter followers about the attack . The author of nine novels, who has more than 38,000 Twitter followers, replied to concerned comments from her fans on Twitter saying: 'I'm okay. It was a random attack. Worried about others so speaking to police now.' NSW police told MailOnline they have received 'no formal' report from Ms Moss over the incident. The Daily Telegraph claimed that a police officer was too busy to help Ms Moss, however NSW police told MailOnline that a police officer spoke to her but she did not want to take the matter further. 'Police were dealing with an unrelated matter and were informed of the incident. 'She provided basic details, however she did not want to make an official report. She was provided with a Victim's Card and encouraged to report it,' they said. A police spokesman said police patrolled Hyde Park after the incident but were unable to find the man. Canadian crime writer Tara Moss is currently a PhD candidate at the Department of gender and cultural studies at the University of Sydney . Ms Moss has used the experience to raise awareness to the broader issue of domestic violence. 'I am often reminded that such attacks are rare compared with violence that occurs far too commonly behind closed doors, usually by people known to the victim. 'Incidents that take place behind closed doors do not usually have witnesses, or get such attention,' she wrote. Ms Moss is currently a student in the city, studying for a PhD at the Department of gender and cultural studies at the University of Sydney. She lives about 50km away from Sydney's CBD with her husband Dr Berndt Sellheim and their young daughter Sapphira in the Blue Mountains. She was recently in the spotlight after appearing on the ABC's Q&A program where she broke her silence over her own experience of sexual assault and rape.

"By . Ryan Lipman . and Daniel Mills . and Leesa Smith . Australian DJ Jack McCord, who was living and working in Bali when he suffered horrific injuries in a motorbike accident, has been taken out of an induced coma at Royal Darwin Hospital. After being flown to the hospital by CareFlight on Sunday night, Jack was expected to remain in an induced coma for up to three days for his lungs to recover but was taken off sedation at about 2pm on Monday. Jack's best mate Sean Doyle, who travelled from Singapore to Darwin to be by his friend's side when he arrived, said he had been responding to music clips and voice recordings sent by his family. Family and friends of Sydney man Jack McCord, pictured with wife Hilda, have raised money to pay for a CareFlight to a Darwin hospital from Bali for treatment after serious motorbike accident on Friday . 'I was talking to him and playing voice clips from his relatives for 10–15mins at a time, and he seemed to respond with eye movements as he heard different voices,' he said. 'I also played music that we often play and he would twitch.' He said the doctors said Jack was progressing in the right direction. 'It’s just a question of how fast that happens and that there’s no infection, and things go on the right path with his lungs,' he said. Mr Doyle said Jack was 'still in a bad way' when he saw him in hospital on Sunday night but felt good about his process today. 'The doctors said it could still take a couple of days for him to wake up – so they will reassess tomorrow and hopefully he starts to come around again but it's still quite early days,' he said. Mr Doyle said orthopedic surgeons will look at scans of Jack's hips today to assess the damage and determine if he needs to be operated further. He said depending on the extent of hip damage, Jack might need to be moved to an east coast hospital, likely Sydney. 'Doctors said if there was any issue over night they would call. I didn't get one,' he said. 'That's the full extent of what we know now.' With Jack's family in Australia expected to arrive at the hospital tomorrow, Mr Doyle said his friend's wife was expected to arrive from Bali by Wednesday and is currently obtaining a visa. On Sunday night, Jack underwent an emergency assessment after arriving on the CareFlight, a Royal Darwin Hospital spokeswoman said. In the accident, Jack suffered internal bleeding, a lacerated lung and shattered pelvis and once taken to a Balinese hospital, had plates put into his arm and shoulder, two put into his pelvis and 12 into his chest . Jack arrived at Royal Darwin Hospital about 6pm on Sunday where Mr Doyle was awaiting him. He said at the time that the flight from the Indonesian island went 'as well as could be expected.' 'He was twitching and moving, so that is a good sign,' he said. 'Obviously transferring him back to Australia is a much better option but I've heard (Indonesian doctors) did a fantastic job so that is very encouraging.' Meanwhile, fundraising for Jack's flight home and ongoing rehabilitation costs set up by Mr Doyle continues to tick over and had reached 69,000 by midday Monday. He launched the online fundraiser on Youcaring.com with a 'moving target' of $80,000 for short-term expenses, to ensure Jack could travel to Australia for treatment. He said any more would go towards rehabilitation costs. Mr McCord suffered internal bleeding, a lacerated lung and shattered pelvis after falling from his bike early on Friday morning, Bali time. Mr Doyle said the night spot which Mr McCord works at closes about 3am, and he was found by locals about an hour later. He has had plates put into his arm and shoulder, two put into his pelvis and 12 into his chest while in a Bali hospital. Mr Doyle said there was still no explanation for how the motorbike accident happened and Jack's friends and family were still trying to piece the incident together. Sean Doyle, pictured left, and Jack, pictured right, have been mates for more than 10 years and after learning about the accident, Mr Doyle set up an online fundraising site . 'We know that four Indonesian boys found him and carried him to a local village hospital,' he said. 'They thought he was gone - they couldn't find a pulse. We don't quite know if they revived him.' As Jack's phone was locked, they had trouble contacting his family, including his wife Hilda. Eventually they contacted the bike rental company, which owned the bike Jack was using, and were able to notify his relatives. Jack was then conveyed from the village hospital to a bigger hospital and it was at this point that costs for his treatment quickly started mounting  because Jack is not an Indonesian citizen, Mr Doyle said. 'There had to be a prey-payment made so he could be admitted to hospital... a sworn statement had to be made committing to pay.' Jamie Kaye, a friend of Jack and the musical director of a Balinese club, helped secure the money needed so their friend could be stabilised and operated on. Mr Doyle said that Jack was now at a critical stage in his treatment. 'The hospital (in Bali) does not have the facilities to keep treating him. Day three of his treatment will be one of the most critical, his immune system might reject what's been operated on,' he said. Jack is an established DJ and producer, and has lived in Bali for three years . He also said the reaction and support to the fundraiser had been overwhelming. 'I started it at 3am on Saturday morning - 36 hours later more than $1,000 an hour is coming in. At the beginning it was about $100,' he said. While the two met about 11 years ago while DJing for house music label Hed Kandi, Mr Doyle said the dance music community in Australia and Bali were rallying behind their friend. 'A whole community of people have come together who know Jack. He's very well known in the music scene and the whole community of dance music has really got behind,' he said. 'People from far and wide, the large contributions have come from  his affiliation with him through dance music. Jack, pictured with his young son Ezekiel, is originally from Cronulla, in Sydney . 'The family is gobsmacked and completely touched how everyone has come together to save this guy's life.' Mr Doyle is the godfather of Jack's one-year old son Ezekiel and said his friend's wife Hilda will apply for a visa on Monday so she can travel to Australia to be with her husband. Jack is originally from Cronulla, and currently lives in Petitenget in Bali with his family. Promoter Paul Strange is a friend of Jack and organised a fundraiser event at Kings Cross club Goldfish, in Sydney, on Sunday night. Mr Strange said while he had not set a target for the event, the aim was to 'raise as much money as possible to get him the treatment.' 'I'm just trying to help a mate I've known for 14 years,' he said. 'Every body in the scene is getting behind him - it's been really positive.' He said when the online fundraiser was launched, it reached about $2,000 at 10am Saturday. 'The response has been phenomenal... to what it's at now is amazing,' he said. A fundraiser was also held in a Bali club on Saturday night. The Goldfish's Facebook fundraiser event page said it took more than two hours for Jack to get to very basic medical help after his accident. 'He was taken to hospital unconscious where it was discovered he had shattered most of the bones in the left side of his body,' the page reads. 'He has been in a coma for the past 24 hours, and has just completed eight hours of surgery to stabilise him in preparation for a medivac to Darwin where he will have a fighting chance at survival.' Jack is considered one of the country's top DJs and producers and has garnered attention at an international-level, according to his biography on the Groove Academey. He was also a global ambassador and brand manager for the world’s No.1 house music label Hed Kandi, his bio reads.","Jack McCord, 46, was taken out of an induced coma on Monday afternoon .

"By . Ryan Lipman . Australia's peak consumer body says Foxtel has only itself to blame for record piracy figures after hit HBO series Game of Thrones was downloaded illegally nearly 2 million times after Monday night's finale. Choice spokesperson Erin Turner said Foxtel's exclusive rights deal with HBO to air Game of Thrones two hours after the U.S. on Showcase had effectively forced consumers unwilling to pay for the cable company's monthly packages to seek alternative means of accessing premium content. Game of Thrones' season four finale aired on Monday night, prompting 1.5 million hits on the web piracy hub TorrentFreak in just the first 12 hours after the show went to air in Australia on Monday. 'There needs to be a focus on accessibility and affordability,' Ms Turner told Daily Mail Australia, adding that Choice opposes costly measures proposed by the Federal Government to tackle internet piracy. 'Compared to last year, we could get Game of Thrones on Quickflix and iTunes - now the only option is to have access to Foxtel. We don't want legislation that props up Foxtel's model.' Scroll down for video . The Game of Thrones season finale on Monday night was illegally downloaded 1.5 million times according to figures on TorrentFreak . 'People know there should be more options. I think they (Foxtel) need to start thinking about what people want and at a price that's fair.' 'There's little competition in Australia and Foxtel shouldn't be the only place where people can go to get certain content.' Foxtel confirmed more than 2.5 million subscribe to its services, with about 525,000 watching each episode of the recent  Game of Thrones season. A spokesman said the company considered illegal downloading a major issue. 'Piracy is a serious problem, which undermines the viability of all creative businesses,' he said. 'It’s not just an issue for businesses, it affects the livelihoods of actors, writers, directors, set designers, and everyone else involved in the production of these programs.' The spokesman said the company had introduced 'flexible' ways for viewers to access its programs legally, including as a full set-top box subscriber or through monthly no-lock in contracts. Choice has hit out at Foxtel and the Federal Government for not providing consumers accessible and affordable choice . The company has also made a 'massive investment' by making content available on tablets, mobile phones and other devices, the spokesman said and specifically pointed out the Game of Thrones subscription, which offers showcase and other channels from $35 per month. 'The bundled model is the one used around the world, including by HBO in the USA, without it many channels and programs would become economically unviable. Incidentally, it's the same model used by publishers around the world who put content behind a pay wall,' the spokesman said. Ms Turner suggested one solution to the issue could be Australian access to Netflix, which would allow people to stream media on various devices. 'That's where we have a different position - we don't support illegal downloading. But we encourage people to go around, geo-block and pay for content in another contry at a price that is fair,' she said. 'This money goes to the content producer. 'We're telling the government not to put in polices that lock us into products - consumers need choice that's accessible and affordable.' But she added that the reasons behind piracy also need to be looked at and that policies currently being considered by the government to crack down on illegal downloading will not stop the issue. Foxtel signed a deal giving it exclusive rights to air the smash series in Australia from this year, shortly after it is screened in the US . 'If you want to stop people illegally downloading, you need to get to the root of the problem,' she said. 'You need to look at access and affordability of content in Australia.' Ms Turner said another major factor propagating the problem was the 'Australia tax' otherwise known as international price discrimination. 'We pay up to 50 per cent more for movies, programs and songs compared to the rest of the world - this needs to be addressed,' she said. Being able to access media on different devices including tablets was also something consumers want, but are not often offered, she said. Choice spokesperson Tom Godfrey said while the organisation was critical and does not support illegal downloading, it was pro competition. 'We want to see better competition to access to digital content,' he said. 'We want consumers to pay but to have a choice in what they pay for.' 'We support people who are seeking to legally access and pay for content from around the world.' Choice has also blamed the 'Australia tax' for forcing people to illegally download . The Federal Government is looking at ways to stop people breaching copyright through illegal downloading, by taking action such warning and then fining repeat infringers, reported Zednet. The Foxtel spokesman said it was the responsibility of 'everyone' to tackle the problem of illegal downloading. 'Content owners should make content available quickly and conveniently, Government should put in place a regulatory system that encourages legitimate use and discourages illegitimate use of content,' he said. 'Internet service providers should assist by mitigating, to the extent they can, use of their networks for unauthorised purposes.' He said all parties involved had an obligation to make sure consumers are educated about the implications of unauthorised use of content and how to access to legitimate sources of content. Choice is campaigning to run a full page ad in the national media telling the government not to force costly policies onto consumers and internet service providers that won't even address the root causes of internet piracy. 'The federal government is considering proposals to stop internet piracy: an internet filter or a three-strikes style warning system,' the Choice website states. 'These proposals won't stop piracy but they will make the internet more expensive and slower for everyone, not just people illegally downloading content. 'We support people who are seeking to legally access and pay for content from around the world,' Mr Godfrey said. The organisation is also calling on the government to axe the 'Australia tax' to give consumers the benefits of overseas competition. A spokesman for the Attorney-General George Brandis confirmed the government is actively considering ways to stop online piracy. 'No decision has been made,' he said. During Senate Estimates on May 28 Senator Brandis said the government stated its view on the need for copyright reform during the 2013 Federal Election campaign. 'Unlike the UK, New Zealand, Canada, the United States, France and many other comparable countries, Australia lacks effective protection against online piracy,' he said. 'Australia, I am sorry to say, is the worst offender of any country in the world when it comes to piracy, and I am very concerned that the legitimate rights and interests of rights holders and content creators are being compromised by that activity.' He highlighted the concern of singers, filmmakers and other people affected by their work being stolen through piracy. 'So we want to do something about that,' he said.","Record numbers of Australians illegally downloaded Game of Throne's season final on Monday .

"By . Simon Cable . She certainly shares her older sister’s striking looks. But despite being just 16 years old, it appears that Lottie Moss has also inherited her famous sibling’s penchant for rebellious behaviour and wayward stars. The teenager, who was recently signed up to the Storm modelling agency which represents her half-sister Kate, has admitted having her tongue pierced and swooning over bad boys such as Justin Bieber. The public school girl has quietly delighted in breaking the rules of her Home Counties school by wearing a stud in her tongue after getting it pierced last summer. Model sisters: Kate, 40, and Lottie, 16 attend the Topshop Unique show at London Fashion Week AW14 at Tate Modern last month . In her first interview Lottie discussed her home life with Miss Vogue magazine - a spin-off of the fashion bible aimed at teenage girls. Read the full interview in Miss Vogue . She said: ‘Sticking my tongue out at school is not wise. They’re quite strict about uniform.’ The model, who lives in Surrey with her parents, talked about a collage of photographs on her bedroom wall explaining: ‘It began with quotes then I started sticking up photo shoots from magazines. ‘On the door of my wardrobe it’s just Justin Bieber though. Then there’s a whole zone dedicated to Leonardo DiCaprio - in his Romeo & Juliet phase obviously. And Zac Efron has his own wall.’ Lottie’s father is Peter Moss, who divorced Kate’s mother Linda in 1987, before marrying Lottie’s mother Inga. As a supermodel Kate Moss has built a 26 year career and £50million fortune since she was discovered by a talent scout at the age of 15 while on holiday with her father and brother in 1988. Lottie came to the attention of the Storm modelling agency as a 13-year-old at Kate Moss’ wedding to musician Jamie Hince in 2011. Anna Wintour, Sir Philip Green, Kate Moss and Lottie Moss at Tate Modern . The supermodel’s rather dubious lovers have included hell-raising Hollywood actor Johnny Depp and drug addicted rock singer Pete Doherty. Since then Kate has gone on to have a daughter, Lila Grace, 11, with magazine publisher Jefferson Hack and is now married to Hince, lead singer with rock group The Kills, with whom she lives in north London. Taking over the mantle: The teenager describes her personal style as being as varied as her older sister's . Lottie has vowed to concentrate on her education rather than pursue a full-time modelling career, and is currently studying for her GCSEs this summer. However, she celebrated her 16th birthday by posting her first set of modelling pictures on Twitter in January. Last month she was photographed in the front row of the Topshop Unique fashion show at London Fashion Week alongside 40-year-old Kate, American Vogue editor Anna Wintour and Topshop owner Sir Philip Green. She went on to do her bit for the family business, giving her backing to the high street brand which Kate has designed a new collection for this spring. In the interview Lottie talks of shopping ‘raids’ with her friends in Topshop adding ‘We would ransack it if we could’. The teenager, whose long blonde hair and willowy frame are eerily reminiscent of Kate at the same age, goes on to describe her personal style as being as varied as her older sister - whose eclectic taste has helped build her into a global style icon. ‘Our styles merge together,’ she said. ‘One days it’s grungy jumpers, the next it’s preppy netball skirts.’ And despite her vow to put her educate first, it seems the lure of the catwalk isn’t too far away with Lottie going on to talk about her dreams of matching her older sister’s career success and hopes of modelling alongside supermodel Cara Delevingne - the 21-year-old society model and grand-daughter of former English Heritage chairman Sir Jocelyn Stevens, often referred to as the new Kate Moss. ‘I’d love to walk in the Chanel show.’ she added. ‘That would be amazing.

"By . Sarah Dean . The idea of setting up a dance class for dogs came to her in a 'strong dream' and she has run with it. Dog behavioural expert Faith Wild, who has worked with disobedient pooches for over 20 years, doesn’t use the normal training tools such as food treats  - instead she’s adopted the two-step, a stereo and a dose of David Bowie. The canine therapist, from the Sunshine Coast, Queensland, is set to launch a $175 6-week course for naughty dogs after practicing routines on her own pets at home. Scroll down for video . Faith Hill is the dancing dog trainer, she rescues dogs and retrains them using a musical method. She is pictured here practicing some moves with her greyhound Lolly . Her three-year-old Greyhound Lolly loves to dance to Bowie, while her new small rescue Maltese cross, Moses, prefers an Irish jig. 'We go for a walk with music around the room and see what they like. Dogs actually like music. My dogs like Bowie, Let's Dance, probably because I like it too,' she laughed. Ms Wild, who is a member of Bark Busters Home Dog Training, calls the new classes 'obedience with a twist'. Talking about her idea to start up doggy dance classes, she told MailOnline: 'I dreamt it. I had a really strong dream, I just woke up. 'I used to do obedience classes but they were big and cumbersome and you can't give individual attention.' Faith currently has nine dogs in her care and says they respond positively to being trained through dance . Faith, pictured here with Moses the Maltese calls her methods 'obedience with a twist' Lolly, the greyhound, loves to dance to Bowie, while Maltese cross, Moses, prefers an Irish jig . She said when she turns the stereo on and the volume up the dogs go 'yeehah!' and 'immediately jump into it'. 'The hardest bit is containing their excitement,' she explained. 'It's a set routine and it's set to certain music depending on the dogs. We have to get the right beat for the right dogs.' For anyone worried that dogs aren't cut out for dancing, Ms Wild reassured: 'We aren't getting them to leap in the air or anything like that. They are doing synchronised dances with their owner.' Ms Wild has tried and tested the class on her own dogs and boasted that they are 'really good'. 'They absolutely love it', she said. Dancefloor etiquette will not be overlooked during the classes, the dogs will be taught at bow at the end of the lesson before they resume their normal lives. The main objective of the class is for them to keep in time with their owners. And after the dogs have pranced around Cooroy Anglican Church Hall in synchronised routines with their owners there will be a 15 minute discussion. ‘I teach people to connect with their dog… the by product is you get a really well behaved dog.’ The aim of Ms Hill's classes is to teach the dogs to do a synchronised routine with their owners, teaching them to be in sync with one another . Ms Hill said the idea for the dancing classes came to her in a dream . The hardest part of running a dance class for dogs is that the animals get too excited when the music starts . The Sunshine Coast woman runs six week training courses that incorporate the musical method for $175 .","Dog behavioural expert Faith Wild is offering a $175 doggy dance course .

"By . Sean Poulter . A new instant tanning spray promoted with images of a naked Kate Moss lounging beside a pool is being secretly withdrawn because of safety fears. The company behind cans of St Tropez Instant Tan Wash Off Face & Body Spray has issued a confidential safety recall to high street and online stores. The problem is related to reports of breathing problems among women customers who accidentally inhaled the spray when using it. Scroll down for video . The company behind cans of St Tropez Instant Tan Wash Off Face & Body Spray has issued a confidential safety recall to high street and online stores . The problem is related to reports of breathing problems among women customers who accidentally inhaled the spray when using it. The product was promoted with images of a naked Kate Moss lounging beside a pool (above) The product was launched only weeks ago, while it featured at London Fashion Week where it was used in catwalk shows by the likes of Cara Delevingne. However, a leaked warning from the Global Executive Director of the British brand, Jessica Finch, says spray can versions of the product should be withdrawn from sale with immediate effect. The memo reads: ‘The objective of this communication is to implement a withdrawal of product from retailer warehouse and shelves and to cease selling online.’ It adds: ‘We have recently been made aware of a small number of isolated adverse reactions to the newly launched St Tropez Instant Tan Wash Off Face & Body Spray (100ml) in light/medium and medium/dark. ‘As a result, we have decided to withdraw the product from our customers’ warehouses and on-shelves with immediate effect. ‘We are currently reviewing the composition of the product and conducting a full risk assessment. 'As a precautionary measure, please also remove these two products from online sales.’ The . problem with the product is not spelt out in the warning to retailers, . however a clue is offered in a hard-to-find safety recall notice on the . firm’s website. This states: ‘We have recently been . made aware that a very small number of customers have experienced . inhalation issues with the newly launched cosmetic product, St.Tropez . Instant Tan Wash Off Face & Body Spray… when used under certain . circumstances.’ It advises customers to return it to their retailer to claim a full refund of the £10 purchase price. The recall is highly damaging to the British brand, which is owned by PZ Cussons and a fortune was spent on launching the instant tanning range in September. Kate Moss was central to the launch with photo-shoots and a video on the St Tropez website heralding the new instant tanning product. Speaking on behalf of the company, the 39-year-old, said: ‘St Tropez is a trustworthy brand and people know it. 'It's a natural looking tan. That’s what people want, they don't want something orange and it is really easy to apply yourself. ‘When I've got a tan, it definitely helps with confidence.’ She added: ‘St Tropez do it so well now. They do look natural you don't have to fear that they go streaky and . not being able to get it off.’ Speaking on behalf of the company, Kate Moss, 39, said: 'St Tropez is a trustworthy brand and people know it. It's a natural looking tan. That's what people want, they don't want something orange and it is really easy to apply yourself' The problem with the product appears limited to the spray can version, rather than the lotion form of the product which is just rubbed into the skin. When launching the product, the company boasted that the formula contains RAINMAC technology with silicon-coated pigments, which prevents them from streaking or running. It said this formula ensures that the colour does not run or rub off. Barry Mulcahy, of Recall UK, said the law around product safety withdrawals is a grey area. Currently, regulations state that firms must do ‘everything practical’ to alert consumers, however there is no official guidance as to what this means in practice. Often, companies run advertisements in newspapers - but that has not happened  with the St Tropez product. St Tropez said it has asked retailers to alert customers by putting up posters in stores. Michelle Feeney, the chief executive of PZ Cussons Beauty, said: ‘St Tropez has recently been made aware that a very small number of our customers have  experienced inhalation issues. ‘When concerns are raised about any of our products, we adopt a responsible and proactive approach. Any customers who have purchased the product can return it to their point of purchase for a full refund.’ She stressed that other products in the range are not affected and apologised to customers for any inconvenience.","Company behind cans of St Tropez .

"By . Deni Kirkova . She is one of the most sought-after models in the business, even after 25 years, and any brand would be proud to bag her for a campaign. Now one shoe brand has gone a step further than using Kate Moss as their billboard face, managing to persuade the notoriously reserved model to smile and even speak in their new fashion video. Moss, 39, is seen talking on the phone in the back of a chauffeur-driven car in a clip for American shoe designer Stuart Weitzman. Stuart Weitzman got nonchalant Kate Moss to beam a smile and even speak in their new fashion video . To the soundtrack of the iconic Nancy Sinatra Made For Walking song, Moss is captured turning heads as she walks through the streets of London in a selection of stylish footwear as the face of the brand's autumn/winter campaign. Retro looking over-the-knee styles are paired with one of her trademark shaggy furs, while smart, patent styles are worn with head-to-toe black. The supermodel turns heads as eccentric transvestite beauticians, schoolchildren, kissing couples and elderly fashionistas all stop to gawp at her fabulous self as she struts confidently through town. Moss says 'there's loads of traffic', 'I'm going to walk', and 'see you in a bit' while on the phone .

"By . Marianne Power . Back in 1987, Ian Fordrey was travelling to Belgium by ferry with colleagues. Enjoying a drink in the bar, 6ft 4in Ian was telling a story when he raised his hands in the air. His fingers grazed a ceiling tile which disintegrated at his touch. Captain Catastrophe: Wherever this man goes, death and disaster follows in his wake. Ian Fordrey is a one-man walking calamity . ‘I remember saying, “Blimey, this isn’t very well built. The place is falling apart”,’ says 52-year-old Ian, a driving instructor from southwest London. But he thought nothing more of it until a month later. ‘I was at home and a news flash came on the television. A ferry had capsized, killing 193 passengers and crew. It was the ferry I’d been on: The Herald Of Free Enterprise. ‘I got a cold shiver,’ he says. ‘I didn’t  know what to think, except that this was getting spooky.’ Spooky indeed. For while it’s the sort of anecdote that most would dismiss as mere coincidence, it was by no means Ian’s first close call and it certainly wasn’t his last. The Herald of Free Enterprise sank killing  killing 193 passengers and crew. Captain Catastrophe had sailed on it shortly before it sank . Dubbed ‘Captain Catastrophe’ by his friends, Ian is the kind of man who drives through a town only to have it go up in flames the moment he leaves. He’s someone who picks a restaurant for lunch and watches it explode before his eyes. He’s dodged three train crashes, three plane crashes, two IRA bombs and four major fires. ‘I don’t know if I’m the luckiest man, or the unluckiest,’ says Ian. ‘Disaster has followed me all my life. Every time something happens, I think “Blimey, not again”. It’s relentless. It’s getting to the point where people say Hail Mary and do Signs of the Cross every time I walk into the pub,’ he jokes. His lucky unlucky streak started as a child. On a school trip to Aviemore in Scotland, aged 11, Ian and his schoolmates arrived at their destination only to find they’d been left dozens of phone messages from worried parents. The train directly after theirs had crashed. A year later, on a school trip to Switzerland the same thing happened — the train behind them crashed in the tunnel. ‘If I’d have known how things were going to play out, I’d have gone straight to church and doused myself in holy water,’ he says. Since then Ian seems to have been on a mission to prove that, far from having the proverbial nine lives, he has 99. In 1992, Mr Fordrey had lunch with his ex-wife and a friend at the Sussex Tavern, in London¿s Covent Garden. The following lunchtime the IRA blew it up, killing one person and injuring five others . In 1992, he had lunch with his ex-wife and a friend at the Sussex Tavern, in London’s Covent Garden. The following lunchtime the IRA blew it up, killing one person and injuring five others. Three years later, in 1995, Ian was having flying lessons at Biggin Hill. The day after his lesson he opened the paper to see his instructor and another pupil had been killed — in the same plane he’d flown in. There had been complete engine failure, just one hour after he’d climbed out of the aircraft. This isn’t the only close call Ian has had in the skies. Travelling to South Africa the plane he was flying in narrowly missed landing on top of another plane, which had received erroneous information from air control; while above Denmark he flew so close to another aircraft that it skimmed the plane’s wing. The year after his close call at Biggin Hill, he was working for a motorcycle courier company delivering a package to a company in London’s Docklands before going home. The scene after an IRA bomb explosion at  South Quay in Docklands. Captain Catastrophe missed that bomb by about 20 minutes . By the time he got home an IRA bomb had destroyed the very same building he delivered the parcel to, killing two and causing £100 million worth of damage. ‘I missed that bomb by about 20 minutes — the same thing happened with the Vauxhall helicopter crash (in January last year a helicopter collided with the jib of a construction crane, killing the pilot and one pedestrian). I’d been right there ten minutes earlier. It makes you think,’ he says with masterful understatement. But what on earth does it make him think? The litany of disasters which have dogged Ian read like a Hollywood film script. How does he get his head around the fact that death follows him everywhere? ‘Sometimes I feel as if somebody’s trying to get me — I might have been Attila the Hun in another life,’ he jokes. ‘I don’t know if it’s bad karma that so much stuff happens around me, or good karma that’s keeping me alive. ‘If I was of a more paranoid nature I’d lock myself up in a little shed and promise not to come out until the second coming. I’m not religious at all, but maybe I should be…’ He says he relies on black humour to get him through, but that he feels a level of responsibility for the accidents which follow in his wake. ‘Every time I’m close to another disaster I honestly think: “If I’d stayed at home would this have happened?” he says. Investigators work at the scene of a helicopter crash in Vauxhall, central London. A helicopter crashed into a crane on top of one of Europe's tallest residential blocks killing two people as it burst into flames . ‘I wish it was funny and slapstick but there’s real tragedy and I feel bad and think about it a lot, but what can you do?’ Indeed, if he’d stayed at home, perhaps the Megaro restaurant in Elounda, Crete, would still be standing. Ian and his then-wife were visiting the town in 2006 and were looking for a spot of lunch when they happened upon the Megaro. They looked at the menu and Ian wanted to go in but his wife insisted they walk further into town to eat. They were just 200 yards down the road when she told him to turn around. The restaurant was in flames. There’d been a gas explosion in the kitchen. The chef lost his arm. ‘I just said: “For crying out loud…” and my wife said: “Oh, for God’s sake.” We were both so used to it at that stage.’ ‘Almost all the bad things happen when I’m on holiday,’ he says. ‘So anyone who travels with me has raised eyebrows and a sense of “bring it on”. But, actually, people travel with me because they know they’ll be safe. Nothing actually happens to me or the people with me, we all miss disaster.’ Take the time in 2010 when Ian and his ex-wife flew to San Francisco for a holiday. They drove from the airport to the centre of town, where they went to a bar for lunch. Everybody was looking up at the telly and watching ‘an orange glow’. ‘The little town by the airport, the one we’d driven through an hour earlier, was on fire. The gas mains had ruptured, killed 50 people,’ says Ian. Driving instructor Ian Fordrey of south London is followed by death and disaster wherever he goes . A couple of years later, on another trip to Crete, Ian found somebody in his seat. ‘I’d paid for extra leg room but there was an old man in my seat. I left him there and took the seat next to him instead. ‘Next thing I know his wife, sitting the other side of him, is screaming. The old boy was slumped over and completely grey. The air hostess called out for doctor and one came and dragged him down the aisle where they resuscitated him. Now every time I book a flight I think of what might happen.’ But that doesn’t stop him. ‘I live for my holidays,’ he says. ‘I’m never going to be someone that just sits around.’ And does he worry for the future? That his 99 lives might be up soon? ‘I’m an eternal optimist, despite all the carnage around me. I do live life to the full and I live life for now, that’s the kind of person I’ve always been. I’m not scared of dying but I don’t want to,’ he says. Yet there are some areas of his life which seem immune from this strange disastrous streak. He has never been involved in a car crash, for example. Which is just as well, as he now works as a driving instructor. Does he tell his pupils what they’re letting themselves in for? ‘It’s not my opening gambit,’ he laughs. ‘But sometimes it comes out and their mouth drops open and they go quite pale. I think it makes them pass their test more quickly — they want to get out, sharpish!’ And what about any more travel? Has he got holidays booked? ‘I’m going to Sharm El Sheikh in July,’ he says. You’ve been warned.","Ian Fordrey, 52, sailed on the Herald of Free Enterprise - just before it sank .

"By . Naomi Greenaway . For most mothers, four children and two grandchildren would be enough to keep busy, but for Wendy Archer from Middlesbrough, her real-life brood just wasn't enough. Wendy, 40, was sterilised after her fourth child but subsequently regretted the decision. So she decided to fork out more than £2,000 on four fake babies and their paraphernalia. Despite having two children still living at home, Wendy now spends hours every day dressing, bathing and shopping for her four fake children - and has even splashed out on a real new crib, car seat and Moses baskets for the fake tots. Scroll down for video . Wendy with babies Shyan, Johnson, Alesha and Thomas, which have cost her £2,000 . Who's a pretty boy?: Wendy holding Johnson . Wendy, 40, who is single, said, 'I just love babies - to me they aren’t dolls, the are my babies. 'They are beautiful and I truly love them. I couldn’t be without them now and they even smell like real babies. 'I love all of my children and my grandchildren, but my children have lives of their own now, and my grandchildren go home at the end of the day.' Wendy gave birth to her daughter Kirsty, when she was just 16, and since then has gone on to have three other children, Nathan, 22, Keenan, 15 and Kia, 13. Brotherly love: Thomas and Johnson snuggling up . Shyan (left) and Elisha (right) both seem a little camera shy for their portrait . But after giving birth to Kia, Wendy, who has never had a job, decided to be sterilised. After she procedure, however, she regretted it, and longed to have another baby. So she bought four reborn dolls - Johnson, Elisha, Shyan and Thomas - and now loves being a full-time 'mum' to them. She said, 'There is just something about babies which I love. I love being around them, dressing them and looking after them. 'I just want to nurture and when I had my sterilisation, I felt a great sense of loss that I would never have a baby of my own to nurture again. 'It made me feel really low, and very sad for a long time.' A trip: Wendy strapping Johnson in his real car seat . But Wendy came across Michelle Cairne’s shop Shelley’s Reborn Dolls in Middlesbrough 18 months ago - and after visiting the shop a few times, she finally plucked up the courage to buy her first doll. Wendy said, 'I bought Elisha for £100 and she was simply beautiful. I was in love, and as soon as I cuddled her the feeling of sadness went away completely. 'It was like I had filled a hole in my life.' The dolls are handcrafted by Michelle to resemble real-life babies. Wendy now has now spent £1,000 on four of her reborn dolls, which she treats in the same way she would her own children - and claims to have spent at least the same again on clothes and accessories for them. Thomas looking cute as a button and incredibly real with piercing blue eyes and a little bit of a snuffle in his nose . Shyan surrounded by her enviable wardrobe . She said: 'I have beds, and Moses baskets for each of them, and they take it in turns to sleep in the crib in my room. 'Every evening I change them into their pyjamas and tuck them into bed and every day I change them, give them fresh nappies and put them in their day clothes. 'I know some people might think I’m mad but so many of my friends have been amazed by how happy the dolls can make people. 'When you cuddle them, they feel like a baby, because their heads lull and they even smell like a real baby, because of the fabric softener their clothes are washed in. It is truly amazing.' Happy families: Wendy with babies (left to right) Shyan, Johnson, Thomas and Alesha . Wendy spends as much time as she can with Shelley in her shop, watching how the babies are made and helping Shelley dress the babies. And she even has a car seat for the babies, so when she goes to visit family members her reborn dolls can come too. Wendy said: 'I haven’t taken them out into town yet, but as soon as I get a pram and I can wrap them up I will do. 'I know people are a bit wary of the dolls or think it is a bit mad, but the comfort I get from them makes my life.' Mum Wendy manages to get all four babies to stay still for a photo (left) and demonstrates how she dresses Alesha (right) 'It’s not about companionship, but I love having the dolls which are all mine to look after,' she added. Baby-mad Wendy has used her savings to partly fund the dolls and is still paying off the rest in weekly installments. But she is now looking for a job, to earn enough money to treat herself to more babies. She added, 'They are absolutely beautiful and real works of art. My daughter Kia loves them as well and she will often help me dress the babies ready for bed. 'I have used some clothes for them from when my children were young, but I do like to go shopping for new things for them as well.' She added, 'I would recommend the dolls to any woman, young or old, who loves babies and longs to look after them. 'These dolls aren’t like child’s dollies - there are handcrafted masterpieces, with lifelike eyes, eyelashes and hands and feet. They are perfect. 'They are just like real babies - except without the crying and the sleepless nights - which suits me perfectly.'

"By . Naomi Greenaway . From afar these intricate portraits appear to be painted using the finest of brushstrokes, but take a step closer and the amazing reality is unraveled: they've been carefully crafted out of reels of folded fabric. These jaw-dropping creations by London-born artists Benjamin Shine each contain 10 to 50 metres of tulle pleated, folded and finally ironed in place to create evocatively realistic images. Scroll down for video . London-born artist Benjamin Shine bunches, pleats and folds a single length of tulle into incredible lifelike images . The artist, an alumni of the prestigious Central St Martin’s art school, now based between Sydney and London, explains how he first conceived the idea. ‘It wasn’t until I saw a crumpled ball of tulle on my studio floor that I noticed its potential. 'Pressing it behind glass, various tones became apparent and I began to test out ways to create identifiable images by manipulating the pleats within the single piece,’ he says. Under the microscope: Elizabeth Taylor's portrait (eye shown above) is crefted from one single length of tulle . Now there are 50 tulle portraits spread across the world from Monaco and New York to London. As well as images of legends such as Andy Warhol, Princess Diana and Elizabeth Taylor, Benjamin has also created works of current icons including Obama and Princess Charlene. The Princess Charlene portrait was unveiled at the Oceanographic Museum in Monaco last year and is now exhibited at Monaco's Barclays Building. Benjamin Shine's tulle portrait of Princess Diana - the fabric is bonded to the canvas using a household iron . Obama’s 'Changing States' portrait was unveiled on inauguration day at the New York Museum of Arts and Design and also became the official commemorative image on merchandise sold through Barnes and Noble book stores across the US. ‘The piece is made from a single decommissioned US flag, torn and re-woven into the image of the President, retaining the silhouette of the original flag and with all the pieces from it,’ explains the artist. '""Changing States"" referenced the ideals of hope and change that Obama championed during his 2008/9 campaign. The piece is currently on loan to a private collector in the US,’ Benjamin adds. A princess in the making: The artist starts by bunching 10-50 metres of tulle onto the canvas then moves it around, pressing and pleating into shape to create final portrait . Benjamin’s other wealthy private clients include Arab sheiks, Sir Phillip Greene and his daughter Chloe. But there’s one wealthy woman still on Benjamin’s wish-list. ‘I would love to create a portrait of the Queen,' he says. Left: Benjamin's portrait of Princess Charlene . was unveiled at the Oceanographic Museum in Monaco last year. Right: the . carefully folded tulle up-close . Another private client to own one if these enchanting pieces is ex-model Orly Wolfson whose husband, businessman and philanthropist Andrew (brother of Next boss Lord Wolfson of Aspley Guise), commissioned the portrait as a surprise for her 30th birthday. ‘My reaction when I saw it was, “Wow!”,’ says the stunning mum-of-two. ‘It was an amazing gift.’ Private collector Orly Wolfson in front of her tulle incarnation: The stunning ex-model received the piece as a surprise from her husband on her 30th birthday . And when friends and family see the piece they are equally stunned. ‘People are always amazed by how lifelike it is and wonder how it can be created out of one piece of material,’ she says. ‘A portrait of yourself is very personal but the way Benjamin captured me is spot on,’ adds Orly. ‘But when I look at it I see a piece of art rather than just a portrait of me.’ So can the artist reveal how he creates . magic from scrunched up fabric? Artist Benjamin Shine in action with his trusty tool -- a household iron -- creating his 'Hands of Time' piece . ‘Firstly the uncut length is piled onto a . canvas as a dense voluminous layer,’ he says. ‘Once entirely covered, I . take a deep breath and go for it! ‘I move the tulle around, pressing, pleating and bunching it to form the basic tones and textures. ‘This initial placement sets up the . entire process before I focus on the detail. Then the tulle is bonded to . the canvas using a hot iron,' reveals the artist. ‘I always envisaged building a diverse . body of work with this medium but subsequently became inundated with . portrait commissions!’ he says. The finished 'Hands of Time' piece commissioned for London Design Week . ‘The final piece remains three-dimensional, set back behind glass,’ Benjamin adds. ‘Initially the portraits were simply a . test-bed for the technique -- I felt if I could create an accurate . likeness, then anything else could be possible.' Benjmamin Shine's portrait of Obama (left) woven using an American flag (up-close right) And last year, Givenchy’s creative director Riccardo Tisci also came knocking. ‘Initially I thought he wanted me to create something as a backdrop to a show or for their stores but when I learned he wanted me to create the pieces as clothing, it really pushed the limit,' he admits. The artist crafted this portrait of Andy Warhol, called 'Fame', from 15 metres of fabric . ‘I had to create the detailed faces at a much smaller scale than anything I had done before, but in doing so it opened up a whole new realm of possibility,’ says the artist. The one-of-a-kind pieces were made-to-order from Givenchy’s Haute Couture salons. Another of his most challenging commissions was an installation for London Design Week, called ‘The Hands of Time’ featuring two clasped hands. ‘It was tricky because of its size,’ he explains. Talk about a big pile of ironing: the 36-year-old artist presses this provate commission of a Sheikah . ‘“Hands of Time” showed me the free-flowing nature of the fabric was as interesting as the detail I was manipulating. ‘So the current series I’m now working on explores a more instinctive, looser approach that shifts the focus from the perfected image to the more ambiguous, abstract and expressive form that’s guided by the natural flow of the material itself,’ Benjamin explains. This series of tulle works will be exhibited at Opera Gallery in London, where he currently has some pieces on show. Elizabeth Taylor hanging in the Grace, a private health club in Belgravia London . So how long does it take Benjamin to carefully fold and pleat the tulle into its final incarnation? ‘I tend to work on several pieces at one time so I don’t time them by the hour, but I like to work and live with each portrait for several months. Deciding the colours is a process in itself. ‘Sometimes a colour can has a particular relevance, but most often I will do several tests in different colours before deciding which one works,’ he says. Benjamin's was commissioned by Givenchy to use his method to create haute couture pieces for the brand . Benjamin's work has been exhibited in galleries including New York Museum of Arts and Design, The London Design Museum and The British Crafts Council. Currently the tulle pieces are available through Opera Gallery London and Opera Gallery Monaco and his Elizabeth Taylor Portrait is exhibited at The Grace, a private health club in Belgravia. A more fluid approach give Benjamin's latest works an ethereal quality . Benjamin is now hard at work on his new series as well as other projects. ‘I‘m always interested in creating something new, something people haven’t seen or experienced before, something that inspires the reaction How? or Wow!,' says the artist. Well, wow-ed we certainly are. Details of future exhibition and where my work can be seen will be published on my website www.benjaminshine.com .

"By . Marianne Power . Danger: Fair skinned Marianne was diagnosed with skin cancer as a teen . This glorious weather has reminded me of the summers of my childhood and endless days on the beach, building sandcastles, splashing in the sea and eating egg and cress sandwiches. Miraculously, given that most of my holidays were spent on the west coast of Ireland, I recall lots of sunshine; new freckles that looked as if they were made by a brown felt tip pen and going home pink with sunburn and happiness. They were a time of innocence in more ways than one. Looking back at the pictures of 18 years of childhood beach holidays, it is hard to compute that such idyllic days could one day be blamed for causing a serious risk to my health. I was 18 when I discovered a large, raised, scabby mole on the inside of my left leg. Still blissfully ignorant of its implications, I spent months paying it scant attention, before finally mentioning it to my GP in the August of 1996. 'How long has it been like this?' he asked, not quite looking me in the eye. I shrugged. 'A few months maybe.' 'Has it got bigger? Has it been bleeding? Has it changed shape?' he asked. I told him it had grown, and that after knocking it with a towel the week before, it was bleeding, which was why I'd finally got around to getting it checked out. 'Why didn’t you come sooner?' he asked. 'I didn’t think it was serious,' I said. I was wrong. Ten days later, I found myself being told by a consultant that I had malignant melanoma, the most deadly form of skin cancer. I remember staring out of the window, stunned, as a man mowed the patch of grass in the middle of the car park and the words 'cancer' and 'chemo' hung in the air. Although the doctors could not say for certain whether the sun caused it, they said there was a strong link, especially with my pale skin and red hair. And they explained the exposure during early childhood was the most damaging. Days in the sun: Marianne as a little girl wears a T-shirt to protect her shoulders but it was on her legs that she developed a cancerous mole . My mother squeezed my hand and I bit my lip to stop myself crying. We were both in shock. Our excuse was that this was almost 20 years ago, before the endless sun-safety awareness campaigns began, and the aisles of SPF creams were fully stocked up with factor 50. But now we're so well-informed about skin cancer's deadly link to the sun that, last week, experts suggested parents who still let their children get badly burnt should be referred to social services for neglect. Is this the nanny state gone mad, as some critics have claimed? Not in my opinion. I only wish we'd known as much when I was young. We might have been more careful on all those summers on the beach in Ireland, as well as on our more adventurous trips to Portugal and France. Although Mum tried to cover us up with T-shirts and apply sun cream to stop us from burning, it was only to avoid the pain - she had no idea of the lasting consequences - and her attempts were not always successful. I remember nights spent lying in cool baths to take out the heat of the burn and trying not to scratch my sore, taut skin. Afterwards, my arms and shoulders often peeled. Oblivious: Marianne didn't consider the long term risks when she sunbathed as a 12-year-old . Living with the scars: Marianne had to have a chunk of her calf cut out to remove the cancer . It seems insane now, to think that we had no idea this was the making of a timebomb. Fortunately for me, after surgery to remove a tennis-ball size chunk out of my left calf, doctors were confident they'd removed all the cancer. I didn't need chemo. After five years of regular check-ups, I was given the all clear. 'The agony these children can suffer is . horrendous. With all the advice out there children should not be getting . burned. It's neglect' I was left with a huge scar on my leg, and a small chunk of it is still missing, but I was lucky. I learned my lesson and now spend summer days in the shade, in a long dress and a wide-brimmed hat. I bore anyone who will listen about the dangers of the sun and am grateful that we all know so much more now than we used to. Or do we? During the current heatwave I’ve been depressed to realise that despite non-stop education about the dangers, some people are still stupid when it comes to the sun, even when it involves protecting their children. The other morning I woke up to pictures of Wayne and Coleen Rooney on holiday in Portugal. They were sitting on a beach in the blazing sun, with two-month-old son Klay on their laps. Yes, he was wearing a little hat, T-shirt and shorts, and may have had sun cream on, but I winced to see his pale pink legs, arms and face exposed in that kind of heat. Lesson learnt: Marianne will no longer stay out in the sun like she did as a child . Last week, hospitals reported seeing cases of severe sunburn among children, including babies as young as four weeks old. No wonder campaigners are now calling for social services to step in to look after children's vulnerable skin, if their parents won't. Pat Wade, founder of charity Burned Children’s Club, says: 'The agony these children can suffer is horrendous. With all the advice out there children should not be getting burned. It's neglect. 'In effect, you're abusing that child because you’re not looking after it properly.' I couldn't agree more. With all we know about cancer these days, letting your child get blistering burns is at least child neglect and, at worst, child abuse. Every year, more than 100,000 people in the UK are diagnosed with skin cancer and 2,500 people die from it. The British Skin Foundation warns that by the end of this blazing summer, around 1,250 people in the UK will contract the disease. And it's young people who are most at risk. Cases of malignant melanoma rose more than any other type of cancer in the past decade, to make it the most common cancer in young adults aged 15 to 34. Just one case of bad sunburn as a child or in adolescence more than doubles your chance of developing melanoma later in life. In fact, experts say letting your child stay unprotected in the sun is more dangerous than letting them smoke a cigarette  - just ten minutes can be all it takes for the sun's UVB rays to burn their delicate skin. Be responsible: Sun cream should be applied every two hours . So why are parents still being so irresponsible? Of course, the vast majority of parents do all they can to protect their children. I was recently on a beach in France (wearing SPF 50 under an umbrella) where I saw children wearing those brilliant all-in-one UVA suits, running around looking like little super heroes. Most parents were regularly spraying on cream, but probably not enough of it - though I appreciate it can be quite an undertaking to apply it to wriggly, excitable kids who keep dashing in and out of the sea and won't keep their hats on. According to research, more than half of Britons don’t reapply sun cream every two hours, as experts advise, and 60 per cent say it's because the cream is too expensive. While there's no denying that keeping a family of four covered in factor 50 is not cheap, it is a lot less expensive than it used to be. 'I know I risk sounding miserable when I . warn people to avoid the sun now that it's finally here -  but I just want to urge . caution' Asda has brought out a range of creams that go up to SPF 50 and start at £3.50. They are also campaigning with the British Skin Foundation to make the government drop VAT on sunscreens, which is deemed a 'luxury item' rather than a health essential. And if you really can't afford endless bottles of sun cream, try a T-shirt and light trousers on your kids, or keep them in the shade between 11am and 4pm. As the saying goes, it's only mad dogs and Englishmen who go out in the midday sun. Isn't it time that stopped? Of course, I know I risk sounding miserable when I warn people to avoid the sun now that it's finally here - we all need the vitamin D and pure joy that it brings - but I just want to urge caution. This summer in France I got more relaxed. The sky was cloudy and there was a cool breeze so I didn't put my hat on, and I didn't reapply my cream. Before I knew it we'd been out all afternoon and my face and arms were decidedly pink. I was so angry with myself. Even I have to remind myself of the dangers and when I do, I think about a lady I interviewed a couple of years ago, whose daughter had the same kind of skin cancer as me, also on her leg. She was diagnosed with a malignant melanoma when she was 13 and was dead at 17. Something to think about next time you’re on the beach with your children, telling yourself the sun isn't really that strong. It is. Sometimes fatally so.","Marianne spent long summer days in the sun as a child .

"By . Ryan Lipman . A week after learning the details of how his daughter was gruesomely killed at the hands Malcolm Naden, Mick Peet discovered drama students were making a play about the search for the convicted killer. Previously Australia's most wanted man, Naden spent nearly seven years on the run including months as a fugitive hiding in Gloucester bushland in northern NSW before his capture and arrest in March 2012 and last year sentenced to life in jail for crimes including murdering two women. On Wednesday, Mr Peet was shocked when he learned Gloucester High School HSC drama students are making a play based on the fugitive's time hiding from the authorities. Mick Peet was shocked and angry about drama students' plans to make a play about the man who murdered his daughter Lateesha Nolan . In 2005, Lateesha Nolan, pictured, was reported missing after being strangled to death by Malcolm Naden in Dubbo . 'There's been quite a fair bit of backlash towards it (the play) from concerned people,' he told MailOnline. 'I don't want Naden represented as a Ned Kelly-style person.' 'I was partially in shock when I read about it, it seemed like they wanted to make a comedy about it,' Mr Peet said of his first impressions. The satirical piece aims to 'poke fun at the situation and how people responded but with serious undertone', one of the students involved with the play previously said, as reported in the Daily Liberal. Students also plan to explore the local reaction to the manhunt, how this impacted tourism and the affect it had on popular culture after things such as hamburgers were named after Naden. Mr Peet, of Bundarberg in Queensland, said he was also concerned that students were asking the community to help develop the play's plot by requesting people provide their stories about near encounters with Naden. Lateesha Nolan was reported missing in January 2005, but Mr Peet only just learnt the full extent of Naden's brutality in early June after requesting to read the murderer's 25-page confession including details about how his 24-year-old daughter was strangled to death in Dubbo. Concerned about Naden being glorified, he contacted the school straight away and has since been liaising with them about the play. Mr Peet said he feared the play could glorify Malcolm Naden, pictured after his capture in March 2012, and create the notion he is a Ned Kelly-type figure . Monster: Mr Peet said Naden should not be thought of as a hero after he gruesomely murdered two women . In a return email, the Gloucester High School year 12 drama group assured Mr Peet their intention was not to 'glamorise' Naden. 'We are aiming to expose the the idea that the myth does not resemble the reality,' the email reads. 'Our aim has always been to paint Naden as a monster but in fact the play is about our town's response to his presence in our region. 'The play aims to expose human folly, in this case the idea that a town can be swept up with a romantic notion of a Ned Kelly-type bushman when in fact he is anything but. 'It is not our intention to explore the actual murders that took place other than to refer to the fact that he did indeed commit these heinous crimes.' The email concluded by recognising Mr Peet's and his daughter's bravery. 'With your permission, (we) would like to refer to this aspect of her character in the play.' Mr Peet and daughter Lateesha, as a child, after a fishing trip together . Mr Peet said the play did not 'seem right' to him but he had offered to contribute and work with the students to expose Naden for what he really is. 'I'm dead set against him (Naden) becoming a Ned Kelly character - he was a wanted murderer who killed two girls and got lucky stealing from people to survive,' he said. 'Him being a ""great bushman"", he was just stealing, he would have starved, that's how he survived.' 'I'm trying not to get upset, but never would I think of doing a play about Ivan Milat and all the backpackers killed.' Mr Peet said the play had stirred up memories of the murder and had been 'pretty distressing' for his family and also the family of Naden's other victim Kristy Scholes. Both women were related to Naden by blood or marriage. 'There are two lots of families involved and all the extended family - it's hard, a lot of people just can't hear his name,' he said. Naden spent months hiding from police in bushland in the town of Gloucester, located in northern NSW . Calling the timing of the play too soon, Mr Peet said it was especially raw after he recently spent four hours with police, who travelled from Sydney to Queensland, reading Naden's confession - something he explained to the school in his email. 'I don't want to talk about Naden because he's a criminal. The things I read were like they weren't human. What he did to my daughter is unbelievable, things you never get over and never being found (her body), it's a hard thing,' he said. 'It's hard to believe another human being can do that to another.' 'He strangled her from behind in a car, she put up a good fight for three minutes but what he did after that I cant even repeat it's that horrible. You see horror movies but this is real life - I thought I was reading a horror book.' 'He made a name being hard to catch, but you have to think about these two girls.' Mr Peet said he still held hope that his daughter's body was found. He added that Lateesha should be remembered as the hero after she stood up for young girl, who had been molested by Naden. At the time of Naden's sentencing, Mr Peet read a victim impact statement and described the killer as a 'souless figure'. Mr Peet's ex partner is Naden's aunty, but he said the murderer was barley recognisable when he saw him in court. Students from Gloucester High School, pictured, have explained to Mr Peet their intention is not to glorify Naden in the play .","Lateesha Nolan was gruesomely murdered by Malcolm Naden .

"By . Naomi Greenaway . If you regularly reach for a hangover cure, just be thankful you don't live in Mongolia. Instead of a traditional fry up, you'd be reaching for a glass of tomato juice and pickled sheep eyeballs. That's according to graphic design agency NeoMam in Manchester, which has created a set of infographics describing the strangest hangover cures from around the world. The least offensive is the English eggs, sausages and bacon, which according to the graphic helps the liver replenish lost electrolytes because of its high protein, fat and salt content. Ditch the fry up?: In Mongolia the traditional recipe for a hangover is eyeballs in tomato juice . Hungary: The inforgraphic warns that bird droppings may do more harm than good . The . efficacy of some other countries' traditional cures are slightly more . dubious - including Hungary's traditional cure of sparrow droppings in . brandy. The . caption on the infographic points out that bird poo can introduce . parasites to the body can cause disease. So perhaps best to give that . one a miss. The Ancient Greek recipe of sheep's lungs and owl eggs sounds equally unappealing but apparently has some underlying benefits. These cheap sources of protein may have worked wonders for Alexander the Great and his cronies as the amino acid's in the protein help break down the ethanol in the liver. Another suggestion -- enough to put you off drinking for life -- is Italy's offering of 'pizzle', the private parts of a bull. The Italian 'pizzle' may not sound appealing but comes highly recommended by athletes . It may not sound like something you fancy nibbling on on a Sunday morning but the remedy comes highly indorsed.

The more appealing options, if eyeballs and other interesting body parts aren't your cup of tea, include Namibia's Buffallo milk, a mixture of cream, clotted cream, rum and liqueurs, and New Zealand's traditional serving of mince and cheese pie with chocolate milk. Designer Danny Ashton, whose agency originally created these inforgraphics for their client cheapflights.co.uk, admits he hasn't tried most of these recipes first hand.

"By . Ryan Lipman . Clive Palmer's Palmer United Party will support the repeal of the carbon tax, the billionaire politician announced on Wednesday. With climate change campaigner and former U.S. vice president Al Gore by his side, Mr Palmer said his senators will support the repeal on the condition that the renewable energy target remains until at least 2016 and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and Climate Change Authority are kept, in a press conference at Parliament House . Mr Palmer also outlined plans for an emissions trading scheme with a zero-dollar starting price to be legislated but would only be enacted if Australia's major trading - including the U.S, China, the EU, Korean and Japan - partners did the same, another condition of his support. Scroll down for video . Clive Palmer has announced his Palmer United Party senators will support the repeal of the carbon tax, but he outline a series of conditions including an emissions trading scheme . At the beginning of his address, Mr Palmer said his discussions today with Mr Gore, who narrated the award-winning documentary An Inconvenient Truth and wrote the book of the same name, enabled him to reconsider 'important issues facing all Australians and the rest of the world'. In voting to repeal the carbon tax in the senate and keeping his party's election promise, Mr Palmer said it was not the 'Labor way or Liberal way, it's the right way that's important for Australia and important for the world'. However, Palmer United senators will move an amendment calling for all energy producers to be required by law to pass on the savings from the repeal of the tax to all energy consumers. 'I expect that all senators from all parties will support this amendment,' Mr Palmer said. He said action by his senators will make Australian industry more competitive internationally and that the carbon tax had set a price on carbon much higher than the rest of the world, hence his support for abolishing it. During his press conference from Parliament House, Mr Palmer was joined by climate change campaigner and former U.S. vice president Al Gore . Mr Gore commended Mr Palmer's address as an 'extraordinary moment' for the world: 'In which Australia, the United States and the rest of the world is finally beginning to confront the climate crisis in a meaningful way.' He said Mr Palmer's plans were 'significant' in supporting the world moving to solve the climate crisis and the Palmer United Party supporting the continuation of the renewable energy target, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and Climate Change Authority and reintroducing an emissions trading scheme under his stipulated conditions. 'While I will be disappointed if the immediate price on carbon is removed, because it is a policy which I believe to be ultimately critical to solving the climate crisis, I am extremely hopeful that Australia  will continue to play a global leadership role on this most pressing issue,' he said. He said Mr Palmer's proposals were all 'high effective' in reducing carbon emissions. With that, Mr Palmer announced they had to go to an 'urgent dinner' and left before any questions could disturb the lovely atmosphere. 'We'll be back later', he said. The release of the An Inconvenient Truth book and film in 2006 brought the issue of global warming to the forefront of international agenda. 'Extraordinary moment': Mr Gore commended Mr Palmer for taking action on climate change . Prime Minister Tony Abbott came to office in September 2013 promising to abolish Labor's carbon tax and replace it with a $2.5 billion Direct Action plan. However, from July 1, when the Senate numbers change, the government will need the support of six out of eight crossbench senators to pass the repeal and abolish climate-related bodies. The Palmer United Party, which will have three senators plus the support of the Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party's Ricky Muir, went to the election promising to abolish the carbon tax. Mr Palmer, who will meet with Mr Abbott in Canberra on Thursday, said that remained his party's position but it would come with conditions. Direct Action would be opposed and instead an emissions trading scheme would be legislated, taking effect when Australia's global trading partners put in place similar schemes. Crossbench senators-elect David Leyonhjelm and Bob Day have signalled they will vote to abolish the carbon tax, but it is unlikely they would support an emissions trading scheme. The Democratic Labour Party's John Madigan opposes the carbon tax, and independent Nick Xenophon wants greater government assurances that what replaces it will significantly reduce emissions. Under the existing emissions trading scheme, the carbon price is due to rise to $25.40 a tonne on July 1, moving to a flexible price from July 1, 2015. Labor announced before the 2013 election it wanted to abolish the fixed carbon price and move to an emissions trading scheme in 2014. A spokeswoman for Mr Abbott said the prime minister welcomed the PUP's support in scrapping the carbon tax. 'We're committed to our budget measures and will continue to talk respectfully and constructively with all senators and members,' she said. Federal Environment Minister Greg Hunt, pictured left, and Greens leader Christine Milne have both reacted to Mr Palmer's announcement . Federal Environment Minister Greg Hunt said Mr Palmer's announcement was 'vindication for the government because our plan to deliver genuine savings' by abolishing the carbon tax. 'The Australian people voted for this change, we stood on this change, and now we see the senate is set to accept this change - this is unambiguously good news for Australian families,' Mr Hunt said in a conference shortly after Mr Palmer's. Greens leader Christine Milne said while she was pleased to see the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and Climate Change Authority continue, but she wanted clarity from Mr Palmer about his 'vague' proposal on a price on carbon in light of the current 'working' emissions trading scheme and if this will be supported.","Clive Palmer announced Palmer United Party will support carbon tax repeal .

These incredible pictures show the UK's largest cake installation, created for The Cake & Bake Show, which took place in Manchester this weekend. The jaw-dropping creation took 17 bakers 6,000 hours to make and weighed 750kg, which included 40kg of chocolate. The jaw-dropping cake installation took over 6,000 hours to make and includes an edible goddess, pictured here . 'Welcome to the Jungle' is full of creatures, including a huge croc complete with razor sharp teeth and life-like eyes . And if you were to eat the entire thing, you might put on a tonne or two. You'd be consuming over 3 million calories. The installation, which is being preserved for the next Cake and Bake Show taking place in October this year, includes a life-size baby elephant, a fabulous peacock, leopards, tigers, monkeys, rabbits, hedgehogs and parrots. The life-size baby elephant was cut into by TV chef Rosemary Shrager, Great British Bake Off winner John Whaite and TV baker Eric Lanlard . Show organisers, Kirsty Collings (left) and Maxine Smith tuck into edible flowers in a corner of the cake jungle . There's also a beautiful Hindu goddess and a crocodile with its jaws wide open. It also boasts 1,700 hand-made flowers and 1,700 leaves. The team of bakers who created the project, known collectively as The CakeBomb, made 100 flowers and 100 leaves each. Every tiny detail on the edible work of art is edible including the the grass and tiny bugs. Even the pebbles and the soil are made from chocolate and sugar. Every detail on the cake installation is edible, including these beautiful parrots and the leaves and flowers they're perched on . In fact, it's so true to life there's even a fake elephant poo, which is made from chocolate and shredded wheat and was made from a mould of genuine elephant dropping! So in case you've got a few thousand hours to spare to make your own, here's what you'll need to add to your next Ocado order: 34kg of flower paste, 500kg of sugar paste and 40kg of chocolate.

Vicki has competed in some of the UK's biggest cake-making competitions such as Manchester's Cake International where she scooped the gold last year . However luck has not always been on Vicki’s side as her first competition in Birmingham in 2013 almost ended in disaster when her cake design of a bulldog’s head fell off at the event. Her fast-thinking dad caught the head before it smashed on the floor and even with only half a design she took the silver award and has learned a few tricks along the way. Vicki working on the leopard, which will only be completed on Sunday, just in time for the competiton . A close up of the leopards leg once it has been painted, resting on edible 'mud' Vicki said: 'When I loaded the bulldog cake into the car I noticed that it was slightly cracking so I tried to fill it in but it was getting bigger. 'When I got to the event and the head came right off and my dad managed to catch it in his hand before it landed on the floor. I was absolutely devastated and cried for ages, I was so exhausted and now I would have nothing to show for it. 'I realised where my downfall was as I didn’t use a support for the cake, usually I use dowels, from now on I generally use flat cakes if I can’t use anything to support it.'","Jungle scene cake was created for The Cake and Bake Show 2014 .

"By . Naomi Greenaway . He’s flashed his toned torso in skin-tight briefs for H&M, looked suave in a Jaguar sports car to promote their latest super-sleek model and gazed down at us from many a billboard to promote everything from fashion brands to his own scent. But David Beckham’s latest brand appearance is somewhat less sexy as he gives a cheesy grin on a bottle of Japanese breath freshener. Victoria Beckham's tweet to tell the world about David's quirky new brand association . The above picture was tweeted by Victoria Beckham this weekend with the caption “Genius! Fresh breath Becks!” Perhaps he feels it’s a worthwhile investment given all those fish oil supplements he’s reported to take, which don’t conjure particularly favourable ideas of Becks’s breath. He can't have put his face to this brand just for the cash, because he's certainly not short. He earned more than £16.5 million from personal sponsorship deals last year, in his final full season as a footballer. Beckham how we've become accustomed to seeing him: in the H&M advertising campaign for his Bodywear underwear range . The former England captain retired from playing in May 2013 after five months at Paris Saint-Germain, having left Major League Soccer in December 2012 following more than five years at the Los Angeles Galaxy. The accounts for Beckham’s company, Footwork Productions, showed that turnover rose in 2012 by 10 percent to £16.5 million pounds. Earlier this month he was in China launching the new Jaguar just one day after celebrating wife Victoria's 40th birthday in LA. David Beckham at the Jaguar  F-Type Coupe launch event in Beijing looking his usual dapper self . The 38-year-old former footballer looked his usual dapper self at the 13th Beijing International Automotive Exhibition where he introduced the new Jaguar F-Type Coupe. Beckham showed off a grey tailored designer suit with undertones of blue, and mirrored James Bond as he cooly stepped out of the white sports car. But what’s most delighted his loyal fans of late is his new swimwear collection for H&M. Proving himself to be the very best of models, the 38-year-old sportsman showcased his buff body and tattooed torso as he posed in trunks, swimshorts and boardshorts in a positively smouldering shoot by acclaimed photographer Glen Luchford. Consisting of three different styles, the swimwear extension of the David Beckham Bodywear collection will be available online and in selected H&M stores from May 2014.

Luckily for Victoria, given his latest endorsement, not only does he look good, he smells minty fresh too.","Victoria tweets picture of hubby on bottle of Japanese breath freshener .

"By . Leon Watson . North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un personally directed a series of rocket launches just miles from his country's border with the South, it emerged today. In an apparent act of defiance that puts the face of its leader to actions provoking North Korea's neighbours, the despot gave the order to launch the  barrage. Satellite imagery and photos released by state media show the rockets were fired several miles north of a popular South Korean tourist observatory near the inter-Korean Demilitarised Zone. Scroll down for video . North Korean leader Kim Jong-un (centre) attending a live-fire drill by a North Korean artillery unit near the eastern border with South Korea . Kim uses binoculars as he guides a live-firing exercise in this undated photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency in Pyongyang . The roar of rockets and the burning trails from the Soviet-era projectiles on Monday could be seen rising from clouds of smoke between mountains on the North Korean side, footage filmed by staff members at the observatory showed. It was not immediately clear why North Korea conducted drills so close to the border, but state media has in recent days called the presence of a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier in South Korea a 'sinister interference'. 'They know South Korean officials will report their missile launches so they've decided to seize the initiative and announce it themselves,' said Michael Madden, an expert on the North Korean leadership. 'They'll get themselves into the news cycle, or attach themselves into a story, rather than let South Korea do so,' he said. Kim Jong Un inspects a civil police post under KPA Unit 171 and a post of the third company of the second battalion under the unit guarding the border . The roar of rockets and the burning trails from the Soviet-era projectiles on Monday could be seen rising from clouds of smoke between mountains on the North Korean side . Kim personally gave the order to launch the rocket barrage, reported the North's main newspaper . North Korea routinely fires short range missiles or rockets into waters off its east and west coasts, but state media rarely shows Kim supervising drills so close to South Korea and has only in recent weeks shown the young leader present at short-range ballistic missile and rocket launches. Kim personally gave the order to launch the rocket barrage, reported the North's main newspaper, the Rodong Sinmun. South Korean officials confirmed the reports. 'North Korea fired from a position very close to the DMZ. It represents such a threat to South Korea that even our civilian tourists were able to witness columns of water caused by North Korean shells landing in the sea,' South Korean Defence Ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok said at a news briefing. 'Our government takes the firm stance that we will mercilessly retaliate if North Korea fires missiles or artillery south of its border with the DMZ.' Photos carried by North's main newspaper showed mobile rocket launchers firing projectiles beside an inter-Korean railway that heads into a mountain range which North Korea has declared a special tourism zone and was once open to South Korean tourists. North and South Korea are still technically at war after the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. The rivals are scheduled to meet this Thursday to discuss preparations ahead of the Asian Games, due to be held in the South Korean city of Incheon later this year. Last Sunday, state media showed Kim supervising the launch of two Scud-class missiles, in defiance of a U.N. ban on the isolated country's use of ballistic missile technology. North Korea, whose lone major ally is neighbouring China, has threatened a fourth nuclear test in violation of U.N. sanctions and has test-fired short-range missiles and rockets four times in the past two weeks.","Kim Jong Un personally gave the order to launch the barrage .

"By . Leon Watson . Seattle's first and only legal marijuana store has run out of stock and been forced to shut up shop just three days after opening. Cannabis City, south of downtown, expects to reopen on July 21, according to a voicemail message for incoming callers. The shop is one of a few dozen across the state to receive a license to sell marijuana legally in Washington, where a state law legalizing the sell of recreational marijuana went into effect last week. Now closed: James Lathrop, the owner of recreational marijuana store Cannabis City, pumps his fist in the air before opening the shop on the first day in which retail marijuana sales were legal in Seattle, Washington . The store sold 11 pounds of the drug between opening day on July 8 and the end of the day on Thursday, the shop’s owner told the Tacoma News Tribune. 'We knew it was coming,' said owner James Lathrop. 'We didn’t have any guaranteed additional deliveries.' Twenty months after voters legalized recreational cannabis for adults over 21, Washington state's first few licensed pot shops opened for business last week. The shops catered to hundreds of customers who were thrilled to be part of the historic moment. The state eventually plans to have more than 300 shops operating. Washington is the second state to allow marijuana sales without a doctor's note. Voters in Colorado also legalized pot in 2012, and sales began there January 1. Washington's Liquor Control Board began working right away to develop rules governing just about every aspect of the industry, from what fertilizers can be used to how extracts are produced. Out of stock: James Lathrop, left, the owner of the recreational marijuana store Cannabis City, sold 11 pounds of the drug between opening day on July 8 and the end of the day on Thursday . Nearly 7,000 people applied to grow, process or sell pot in Washington, but fewer than 100 growers have been approved . A crowd waited to buy legal recreational marijuana outside of  recreational marijuana store Cannabis City, on its opening day . But the board has been overwhelmed: Nearly 7,000 people applied to grow, process or sell pot, and those licenses are being reviewed glacially by the board's 18 investigators. Fewer than 100 growers have been approved, and only about a dozen were ready to harvest in time for the market's launch. As for the stores, most first had to get lucky in state-run lotteries for 300-plus retail licenses being issued. Then they had to strike deals to buy product from the growers — in many cases at exorbitant prices. Much of the marijuana being sold last Tuesday cost at least twice the $10 to $12 per gram offered by the state's unregulated medical dispensaries. In Seattle, hundreds of people waited in the warm sunshine outside for Cannabis City to open at noon. Store owner James Lathrop declared it time to 'free the weed' and cut the ribbon — actually yellow police tape strung across the shop's door.","Cannabis City, south of downtown, expects to reopen on July 21 .

"By . Leon Watson . Police in Russia are hunting a babysitter who dumped a toddler in a hair salon after going in for an expensive cut. Marina Kougadova, 24, was hired to look after two-year-old Lena Kouranova long-term after the child's mother Yulia got a new job. Mrs Kouranova, 28, was offered the chance of a six-month contract in the tourism industry and was unable to take the girl with her. But after taking the girl to a hairdressers in the city of Tolyatti in the south-western Russian province of Samara Oblast, Kougadova abandoned her and left without paying. Scroll down for video . Two-year-old Lena Kouranova was left in a hair salon in the city of Tolyatti in the south-western Russian province of Samara Oblast . Hair salon owner Pelagia Yurieva said: 'The little girl sat there quietly while the woman who I thought was her mother was getting her hair done, and when it came to pay, she said she had forgotten her money in her car and would leave the girl with me while she went to collect it. 'It was really surreal when she didn't come back and at 9pm at night I was still sitting there with a girl.' The hairdresser said she had not immediately called authorities as she kept expecting the customer to come back and could not work out what had happened to her. But after two weeks of having her at the salon every day she had reported the matter to police, and social workers had taken the child into care. The head of the custody and guardianship department of the Kirov district, Lyudmila Bobowa, said: 'She was brought to us without any identity papers and apart from her name, Lena, she wasn't able to tell us anything else. The two-year-old girl Lena (left) whose babysitter left in hairdresser for two weeks . Lena's mother was offered the chance of a six-month contract in the tourism industry and was unable to take the girl with her . The child's mother now faces an agonising wait to make sure that she can have her daughter back . 'We immediately tried to find her relatives and to clarify the situation, but it was quickly clear that this wasn't going to go anywhere. 'It was only when we put out an appeal through the media including images that the girl's mother got in touch. 'This was seen by the girl's mother originally got in touch and told us she thought the child was safely with the babysitter. 'She said that she had regularly called the babysitter who had always pretended that the child was well. On the occasions when the mother asked to speak to her, the babysitter always said she was refusing to come to the phone or sleep, which she accepted because of her age. 'The girl is well-groomed, well-developed, and has honestly been looked after. She can even read nursery rhymes and speaks reasonably well for her age despite the fact that she didn't know any more than her first name. 'Our impression was that she was from a good family so we couldn't understand how it was that her mother at abandoned her. The fact that it was apparently the babysitter helps to explain a lot.' The child's mother now faces an agonising wait to make sure that she can have her daughter back after it was revealed officials had already started the proceedings of giving the child out for adoption, and they now need it to consider the application for the mother to have her daughter back. Bobowa said: 'It will probably be okay for to have her daughter back but we still need to go through the paperwork and process a formal application.'","Marina Kougadova, 24, was hired as a long-term babysitter in Tolyatti .

"By . Leon Watson . Nigeria's National Council of State is promising to deliver 'some good news' very soon about more than 200 schoolgirls held captive by Islamic extremists for nearly three months. The council, made up of past presidents, state governors and leaders of parliament, is 'satisfied the security agents know very well where the girls are located,' Governor Godwill Akpabio said. The rescue of the girls was top of the agenda at the meeting yesterday, he said, and 'military authorities also confirmed that efforts were being made and that very soon we will have good news.' Waiting for news: Solome Ishaya, sister of kidnapped school girls Hauwa Ishaya stands outside their family house in Chibok, Nigeria. Some 276 schoolgirls were abducted April 15 from a school in northeast Chibok town . The governor added the question is not whether the girls can be rescued but how to do it without endangering their lives. He said the council, which was addressed by President Goodluck Jonathan and his national security advisers, was left confident that the president and the military are 'on top of the situation.' Tuesday's council commended Nigeria's military and security agents, who have been roundly criticized at home and abroad for their failure to swiftly rescue the girls and to curb an escalating Islamic uprising by Boko Haram that has killed thousands. Some 276 schoolgirls were abducted April 15 from a school in north-east Chibok town. Dozens escaped and 219 still are missing. Last week the Defense Ministry reported the detention of a businessman heading a 'terrorists' intelligence cell' who it said 'participated actively' in the Chibok abductions. Negotiations to free the girls without a fight appear to have stalled, with Boko Haram demanding the release of detained extremists in exchange for the girls. Jonathan has rejected those demands. A screengrab taken from a video of Nigerian Islamist extremist group Boko Haram shows girls, wearing the full-length hijab and praying in an undisclosed rural location . Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau has threatened in a video to sell the girls into slavery and as child brides if his demands are not met. In the video, some of the girls say they have converted from Christianity to Islam. The extremists are believed to have divided the girls into smaller groups being held at different camps and possibly across borders in Cameroon and Chad, where sightings have been reported. There also have been reports that some of them have been forced to marry their captors. Boko Haram has been kidnapping people for more than a year but received international condemnation for the mass abductions of the Chibok girls, which has led to a worldwide movement called #BringBackOurGirls. Boko Haram - which means 'Western education is sinful' - had attacked many schools and killed hundreds of students, some burned alive in dormitories. This year the extremists have launched a two-pronged strategy of bombings in cities and towns and a scorched-earth policy in villages where they kill residents, set huts and shops aflame and steal livestock and food supplies. Hundreds of thousands of people have been made homeless.","Nigeria's National Council of State says military are taking action .

"By . Naomi Greenaway . A family are still desperately searching for a missing mum  after she vanished during a shopping trip near her home in Collinstown, West Dublin, three years ago. Esra Uryun was 38 years old when she disappeared leaving behind her husband of seven years, Ozgur, her then two-year-old son Emin, now five, and her older sister, Berna Fidan. ‘Has someone got hold of her? Has something horrible happened to her? It just doesn't make sense,’ Berna says fighting back tears on tonight’s Channel Four documentary, The Missing. Scroll down for video . Berna Fidan, sister of missing mum Esra Uryun, whom she's searched tirelessly for since her disappearance three years ago . The harrowing programme delves into the mystery of the 2,000 missing people who vanish without a trace in Britain each year. ‘She wouldn't just run off on her own. That child was everything to her. I don't believe she would have taken off and left her baby behind,’ says Berna as the documentary airs touching home video footage of a doting mother kissing her little boy and saying, ‘I love you’. Esra's distraught family is unable to . continue normal life and unable to grieve, but live in hope that they . will one day be reunited. Esra Uryun, 38, has not been seen since leaving her home at Collinstown in a silver Renault three years ago . After Esra’s disappearance, her husband and son moved to London and in a heart-wrenching moment little Emin talks about the mother he hardly remembers. 'She went to the shops by herself. She didn't know the way home, then she got lost somewhere,' he says as he plays at home with his father. Ozgur tries to describe how hard it’s been for his son, ‘I can't understand what's going on. Think about his little brain -- how he's trying to cope with the situation.’ Turning to his own experience he says, ‘You’re always fighting between your heart and your mind. Your heart is saying she's coming back but your logic is saying the probability is getting low.’ An hour after Esra left for the shops that fateful morning, her silver Renault was clocked on CCTV footage in the nearby town of Bray. Since her disappearance Berna has gone to extraordinary . lengths to bring her sister home and has visited Bray fifteen times in the hope of uncovering further evidence. ‘It hurts me to be here, but I keep coming back all the time -- because she's here somewhere and I need to find her,’ she says bravely of her search. ‘I try and block it all out my head and pretend it's not my sister. I hate putting these posters up. I see lamppost with missing dogs and cats and I'm having to put my sister's picture up,’ she says reaching breaking point. The police found Esra’s car abandoned in the town’s parking lot, but there’s no proof Esra herself was the one who drove it there. 'There wasn't a shred of evidence she was ever in Bray because the CCTV footage is so appalling, you can't see who the driver is,’ explains Berna. 'All I want is an answer and that's when I'll be at peace. There’s a baby, who's now five years old, who's growing up without the love of his mum.' Because there’s never been a sighting of Esra since her disappearance, police have downgraded the investigation. The detective leading the search suspects suicide. 'I know she's here somewhere -- I just have to find her': Berna Fedan with a picture of her missing sister Esra Uryun . Blurry CCTV footage showed a female walking from where the car was parked towards Bray Head, a nearby hill. 'I can't say whether that's Esra or not but I can say the CCTV does not pick up that person coming back down,’ the detective explains. But Berna is convinced the woman is not her sister. The detective believes the passing of Esra’s father in 2010 may be linked. ‘It affected Esra more because she was living away from her family,’ he says and adds, ‘In 70 per cent of suicides, there's no note.’ But Berna is far from convinced and continues to publicise her plight. 'What damn proof do they have that my sister's dead? 'How can you commit suicide and no one come across the body in such a public place. It's still a search in my eyes. She could not bear to be away from her son.’ As she prepares to leave Bray, where she will no doubt return, Berna explains, ‘It’s hard coming and it’s even harder going back. She’s my flesh and blood, my only sister. She’d do the same if it was me.’ ‘I know I‘m torturing myself but how can I let it go? With no closure, how can I let it go. It’s impossible,’ she says. Berna continues her search to bring her beloved sister home but, like thousands of families round Britain, a lifetime of uncertainty may lie ahead. Berna Fidan’s search is featured in the Channel 4 series The Missing, which starts today at 10pm.

The ultimate power couple, world footballer of the year Cristiano Ronaldo and Russian supermodel Irina Shayk, have appeared even more glamorous than usual in a racy shoot for Vogue Spain. Real Madrid superstar Ronaldo was styled by Mother Nature for the cover image in Vogue Espana, with Shayk shielding his modesty in front of him wearing a strapless white dress. The shoot by renowned glossy photographer Mario Testino back in March was the first time the pair, neither of course strangers to the front side of a camera lens, have modelled as a duo.

"By . Bianca London . Retired party girls Millie Mackintosh, Suki Waterhouse and Daisy Lowe have swapped cocktails at the Groucho Club and late nights at the Box for early morning work-out sessions, which involve whipping and bear crawling. The IT girls have been hanging out at SBC, which stands for the Skinny B**** Collective, and it's fast become the go-to gym for fashion's most famous fitness fanatics. Run by trainer Russell Bateman, SBC is an elite and intense 50-minute circuits style class run in Baker Street's Fitness First and exclusive Chelsea gym KX. Scroll down for video . Elite new fitness crowd: The Skinny B**** Collective is drawing in fashion's finest faces and whips them into shape in an intense 50-minute work-out session . Russell offers group sessions or one-to-one personal training that aims to help class-goers get lean, strong and fit aesthetics. He designs exercises that speed up metabolism, build fitness and strength and decrease body fat. 'My buddy once said I only trained skinny bitches, hence the name Skinny Bitch Collective was born,' Bateman told MailOnline. 'It was a jokey comment but It stuck in my head. I came up with a catchy name and the rest is history. Famous fan: Bateman likes to challenge the body in ways you wouldn't conventionally see. Millie Mackintosh (pictured) doing upside down burpees against a wall is one of those ways . Just whip it: Model Suki Waterhouse uploaded a video of her in the class to her Instagram account . 'There's nothing skinny about SBC. We are plump with female empowerment and re-education in a world saturated with misconceptions about fitness and health.' Suki Waterhouse is said to love the class, which has attendees crawling on their hands and knees and doing one legged burpees, because it helps her 'release her inner animal'. Bateman, who has been a trainer for eight years and established the SBC project last year, said of his class: 'I fuse traditional movements with more extreme movements and exercises that' you wouldn't have done since a kid. Quirky techniques: Bateman (left) has girls crawling into each other and carrying each other on their backs (right) to challenge their bodies . 'I have girls crawling into each other and carrying each other on their backs. This can challenge the body in ways you wouldn't conventionally see. Millie doing upside down burpees against a wall for example is a strange sight obviously!'. Thanks to his celebrity clientele who can't stop raving about him, Bateman is in very high demand and selective about who he will train. He has a huge waiting list and his Saturday classes are invite-only. 'You have to be a nice person with a good heart and work your socks off - no time for negativity,' he says of the selection process . Model friends: Bateman has joined forces with Danielle Copperman, the nutritionist behind website Model Mange Tout (pictured, left, with model Daisy Lowe) He has recently launched online training classes and diet programmes formulated by Danielle Copperman, the nutritionist behind website Model Mange Tout, who happens to be BFF's with Charlotte Wiggins and Sam Rollinson. SBC's model clients were asked by Stella McCartney to design and consult on her London Fashion Week show, whereby models showcased her designs while running on a treadmill. SBC, where price is on application, has already hosted pop-ups in New York and Ibiza and has big plans for the future. 'Without sounding too up myself, SBC is training the next generation of female icons,' Bateman told Fashionista. 'You’re going to see a lot of our girls fronting campaigns this year and on the screen.' Have more sex, sleep well and move daily. Commit to eliminating . anything that isn't improving the quality of your life. If it isn't . making you stronger it's making you weaker. Eat loads of cruciferous vegetables too as this will help to detox and shift stubborn fat from legs and tummy areas. Skinny Bitch Collective founder and personal trainer Russell Bateman is the go-to guy to hone the coltish physiques: London's stylish model set. I've trained with him a handful of times over the last few months and the man is a fitness genius. To say he works you hard is an understatement but the results speak for themselves. There's no danger of reaching an exercise plateau either as he's continually inventing new methods of torture to mix things up and a single session can have you running against the wall while performing a semi-handstand, executing single leg burpies and primal crawling wearing an exercise band. He's big on the holistic approach too - both in terms of the fuel you put into your body and also in the way he encourages collaboration within the collective - from model Danielle Copperman and her inspired ModelMangeTout recipe blog to hip exercise gear designer Charli Cohen and jewellery-designer-meets-health-writer, Cat Meffan. Y . ou don't have to be uber skinny to join the gang (thought you do need to be invited and possess the right attitude) but if you stick with the SBC programme you soon will be!

"By . Bianca London . Millie Mackintosh is known for looking after her body and often embarks on gruelling juice cleanses to slim down for big events. And it seems that she has been passing on her healthy words of wisdom to fiance Professor Green. The loved up-duo decided to go on a healthy eating regime recently, but it backfired and nearly ruined their holiday. Scroll down for video . Professor Green and Millie Mackintosh (pictured) embarked on a detox when they went on holiday but Millie says it nearly ruined it because they had 'detox hangovers' Speaking to Feelunique.com, Millie said: 'At Christmas Stephen and I were on . holiday and neither of us were happy with our bodies so we decided to go . on this healthy eating plan but we both got that detox ""hangover"", and . it nearly ruined our holiday. 'So for the wedding I’m doing a proper, . sensible good from the inside out plan, working with my friend Maddy. Millie doesn't really look like she needs any kind of detox... 'For me it’s not about losing weight but shifting that bit of puff, those . few inches of bloat.' The glamorous Made In Chelsea star and her rapper beau have instead opted for a sugar-free detox course with expert nutritionist, Madeleine Shaw. 'She’s . an amazing nutritionist and she’s put us on this great programme. It’s . no sugar, as it’s so ageing for the skin and body, but you can have . sweet treats like sugar-free brownies. 'I have 1 ½ cheat . days a week when I have a roast, cooked breakfast and my favourite – . clams and pasta, it’s my weakness,' she said. Millie . says her top tip for slimming down is eating protein for every meal and . in the morning she mixes up frozen berries with chia seed, coconut . water and a vitamin and protein powder. When she is looking for a sweet hit, she blends milk, raspberries and raw cacao together. The reality TV star also shared her beauty secrets and exactly how she gets her infamous dewy glow. She said: 'People . are always really interested in what make-up I use. Even men come up to . me in the street and ask me what foundation I use because their . girlfriend wants to know; it's kind of bizarre. Millie is training hard and eating well ahead of her wedding to Pro Green (pictured, right) but says she still has her treat days and eats roast dinners and cooked breakfasts . 'I swear by tinted moisturiser, I drink lots and lots of water and sleep is boring but it does work. 'My signature look is natural glowy skin, a . defined eye with some lashes, natural wavy hair, and I love a smokey . eye for the evening. 'I always leave the house with mascara on, I feel naked without it and my desert island product would be a hydrating face mask, I use them a lot when I travel and fly and if I'm hungover.' She cites her top products as YSL Volume Effect Mascara, Millie Mackintosh Lashes, L’Oréal eye liner, Benefit You Rebel SPF15 tinted moisturiser, balm cleansers from Eve Lom, Emma Hardie or Darphin as well as face massages and Aromatherapy Associates face oil to beat any signs of ageing. Millie says she is embarking on a healthy sugar-free diet ahead of her wedding . Millie also explains how she was bullied at school because she had bad acne. She said: 'I . used to pretend to be sick and once I didn’t go in to school for three . days. It was hormonal, and over time I realised that I had to treat my . skin gently, not so aggressively. 'Now I keep it clean and treat it carefully and it’s much better, much calmer but I still get the odd breakout. 'Using lavender oil to dab on keeps the bacteria away, and I steer away from anything heavy or too active.' 1. She preps her skin with a hydrating face mask. 'It's all about the skincare, I use this amazing Decleor hydrating face mask,' she says.2. She then applies Guerlain primer. 'Apply with a foundation brush to get that glow lasting all day,' she advises.3. She then uses Shiseido tinted moisturiser and concealer for a light coverage and to even out her skin tone.4. She applies two concealers because she explains how the skin under our eyes is much thinner and we also want to illuminate it. She loves the Stila illuminator.5. She then uses a Benefit highlighter, Watt's Up. 'Apply along the top of your cheek bone and highlight the brow bone too,' she says.6. She completes the look by sweeping Guerlian bronzer over her skin and a Jurlique transcluent powder.","Loved-up duo got detox 'hangovers'

"By . Sarah Gordon . A network of disused underground tunnels, that were once used to transport post across London, have been given the go-ahead to open as a tourist attraction. Mail Rail first opened in 1927 and in its heyday used a series of driverless trains to transport post beneath the capital's streets from the East End's Whitechapel to Paddington in the west. Undiscovered: The public have never before been allowed into the 'secret' tunnels that were used by the Post Office to distribute mail across London . Long forgotten: Old Tube stations and secret tunnels have long intrigued visitors to London, so the abandoned Mail Rail is expected to attract a lot of attention . Mothballed: The Post Office Railway currently lies disused under the streets of London after the network of tunnels were abandoned in favour of road transport in 2003 . Islington Council has approved plans to allow tourists to descend beneath the city and ride the trains that sit below some of the London's most iconic sights. From 2020, visitors will be able to ride the 'secret Tube', departing from Mount Pleasant, in Islington, which was once one of the largest sorting offices in the world. The original track was 6.5 miles long and had a total of eight stations and at some stages narrowed to just 7ft wide. Tourists will ride the miniature trains for a total of 0.6miles, while learning about the history of the Post Office. A world apart: More than 100 years ago the tunnels were approved for use by the Rail Mail trains, but they were abandoned in 2003 . Deeper underground: The miniature trains travelled more than 6 miles across London, with eight designated stops, passing below Oxford Street and just feet away from the Bakerloo Line . Ray Middlesworth, an engineer who has worked in the tunnels, said: 'It's the holy grail for underground explorers - a hidden part of the rail network. Some people called it the Post Office's best-kept secret.' Adrian Steel, director of the British Postal Museum and Archive, added: 'It is a fantastic opportunity that . Islington borough council has given us - the green light to open up . these unique tunnels to the public and reveal the captivating story of . Mail Rail.' See the sights: The development of the 'secret Tube' into a tourist attraction will combine with the opening of a special museum devoted to the history of Britain's postal service . Bright future: The train, which will travel 0.6miles under London, will open in 2020 and will explore the history of the tunnels . A new postal museum will also open on the Mount Pleasant site in 2016, displaying artefacts from British postal history, including telegrams from the Titanic, original evidence from the Great Train Robbery trial and pistols used to defend mail coaches in the 19th Century. The British Postal Museum & Archive (BPMA) still needs to raise £0.5million and will be launching a public appeal later in the year. It is also waiting to hear the outcome of an application for £4.5million . from the Heritage Lottery Fund. The Mail Rail was finally closed in 2003, after Royal Mail built a new hub in Willesden, west London and it was decided it would be cheaper to transport mail by road instead of using the tunnels.","The tunnels first opened in 1927 to service London's Mail Rail trains, but were abandoned in 2003 .

"By . Marc Horne And Ben Ellery . Their tight-knit team spirit has helped them soar to the summit of the Commonwealth Games medal leader board. But it appears some members of Team England may be enjoying Glasgow’s party atmosphere too much. Olympic long-jump gold medallist Greg Rutherford, 27, criticised ‘ignorant athletes’ who have been disturbing his preparations with their noisy antics. Disturbed: Greg Rutherford is hoping he can repeat his London Olympic Games success . Unlike its strictly alcohol-free London equivalent, Glasgow’s games village is designed to allow athletes to let their hair down and enjoy themselves. The £230million hub, in the city’s east end, features a bar, jukebox, beauty salon and thousands of free condoms. There are also a number of chilled cabinets filled with bottles of free champagne. London 2012 star Rutherford yesterday expressed his frustration through a series of Tweets which appeared to point the finger at his England teammates. He wrote: ‘Being in an athletes village is great until the ignorant athletes make more noise than a herd of elephants startled in a china shop. ‘It bloody kills me. I have the noisiest people above me with some serious big feet banging around. 'I think some people are determined to annoy every other athlete around them. Strong words will soon be said.’ His friend and England teammate Bianca Williams expressed sympathy, writing: ‘Me too Greg! It’s so inconsiderate. The door slamming is so ridiculous.’ One of the co-ordinators of London’s Olympic village advised the long jumper to make a formal complaint. Lucy Katan, of the Sport and Recreation Alliance – who managed the arrival and departure of 24,000 athletes and support staff at the 2012 Games – tweeted: ‘Report them to village management. Is the party atmosphere in the athletes’ village the reason why Olympic cycling golden girl Laura Trott failed to pick up a medal in yesterday’s women’s 10km scratch event? The 22-year-old had been favourite but could manage only 11th place. Fellow Olympic team pursuit champions Dani King and Joanna Rowsell finished fourth and 19th respectively. 11th place: Laura Trott failed to pick up a medal in yesterday's women's 10km scratch event . ‘All athletes should respect each other’s preparations right until the last day of the Games.’ The Commonwealth Games Federation insisted athlete rowdiness was not its responsibility and that it was up to English officials to police their competitors. Chief executive Mike Hooper said: ‘Team England manage their team and this is a matter for them. Because of the size of their team they have a specified part of the village that they can control. 'It’s a great environment within the village and we have received absolutely no complaints whatsoever. The tweet that he [Greg Rutherford] made is news to me.’ A Team England spokeswoman stressed it was happy with the Games village and its facilities. She said: ‘We will be reminding athletes to be considerate to each other when sharing a house.’ However, a team insider hinted that the bulk of the disturbance may be coming from athletes who are representing other nations. He added: ‘We are next to South Africa, Mauritius and Wales. Everyone is bordering everyone.’ The world’s fastest man, Usain Bolt, sprinkled his stardust on the Games when he arrived in Glasgow yesterday. However, the Jamaican said he would compete in only this week’s sprint relay and not take part in his favoured 100m race as he is recovering from injury.","Greg Rutherford criticises 'ignorant athletes' disturbing his preparations .

"By . Mia De Graaf . Crumbling into the ground, this is the hauntingly beautiful relic of a church left abandoned for 30 years after miraculously surviving one of the world's most devastating natural disasters. It was hit by the tragic Irpinia earthquake of 1980, which killed 3,000, severely injured a further 10,000, and left 300,000 homeless in the tiny village of Conza, southern Italy. Survivors fled to the countryside five miles away, rebuilt the town there, and never returned. Crumbling: This is the shell of a chapel that incredibly survived the Irpinia earthquake of 1980 in Conza, south Italy, that killed 3,000 and injured 10,000 . Discoloured: The walls which were once painted vibrant blue, red and gold have become marred by dust over the years after villagers fled . But incredibly, the once-grandiose chapel remains as a lasting, haunting reminder of the past. Large swathes of the roof have collapsed, leaving wicker and wood panels where there was once elaborately carved white stone. The vibrant blues and opulent golds that once coated the walls have been marred by dust. Swamped with lumps of brick and splintered doors, one chamber is almost impossible to walk through. And the altar is a shell of the stone monument it once was. Destroyed: The once opulent white stone ceilings have given way, exposing the wicker foundations and wooden eaves, leaving the ground swamped in debris . Stuck in time: These prayer stands may be smashed and coated in a film of cobwebs, but they still offer a glimpse into the history of the village's Catholic heritage . Capturing the eerie structure, photographer Gianluca Tesauro and artist Jorge Mañes Rubio aim to shed light on churches across southern Italy that have been inexplicably abandoned. It is part of a series titled Buona Fortuna, or 'good fortune', which the pair will use to petition for the derelict monuments to be reopened to the public. They said: 'Most churches and chapels were bricked up, waiting for a more than unlikely reconstruction. 'Unfortunately bricks didn’t keep looters away and most of the relics have been stolen. 'Given the great importance and value that these religious symbols have in southern Italy, most figures, santos, madonnas, and paintings have disappeared, leaving behind a significant cultural void hard to replace. Unrecognisable: The altar has been stripped to its bare brick foundations - a dramatic transformation from the opulent style of decorative Italian churches . Looted: Furniture and any remaining items are strewn about the chapel, which has been raided by looters over the past three decades. Photographer Gianluca Tesauro and artist Jorge Manes Rubio want to shed light on the abandoned monument and a number of others across earthquake-hit southern Italy to preserve what is left . 'As artists, we are on a permanent quest for this kind of situations, where our work can contribute in changing the way we perceive these places.' They added: 'At this moment though our interest goes beyond these photographs.

A 14-year-old girl has a rare condition that makes her vomit for hours on end if she gets excited. Megan Harvey has been forced to miss sleepovers, days out and parties for fear of a sickness attack - which can last around 12 hours. And the anticipation ahead of her school prom left her hospitalised for a week. It means that family holidays are a . nightmare - as Megan's condition is triggered by the emotions of . anticipation leading up to an event. The condition, Cyclical Vomiting Syndrome (CVS), emerged as she reached secondary school, when she would be struck be severe vomiting attacks towards the end of every term. Her mother, Jodie Harvey, said: 'We didn't understand why she got so ill in the summer holidays until she was diagnosed with CVS. 'Then we realised it was her excitement about going out and having fun which was making her so sick. 'She goes into a kind of waking coma when she's sick and when she's recovered she can't remember what has happened. 'One year we travelled to Spain by coach for our family holiday - Megan was sick for the entire 12-hours of the journey - it was awful. 'Now I don't let Megan go for parties or sleepovers before we go away - we try and keep her as quiet as possible to prevent the holiday being ruined. 'It can be really upsetting - as a surprise I once booked tickets to go roller skating at the O2 before Christmas. Hospitalised: The condition left her hospitalised for a week due to the anticipation of her school prom . Devastated: Megan and her mother Jodie (right) had already bought her dress for prom when the attack hit . 'After telling her she got so exited that the evening before we were due to go she got sick and we didn't end up going.' Megan, from Belvedere in Kent, even missed her end of school prom due to her severe CVS. She and her mother went shopping for the dress and shoes, arranged the hairdressers and were ready for the big night when a sickness attack hit leaving Megan incredibly ill and unable to celebrate with her friends. Family events to the science museum, a . birthday pamper party and a trip to the races have also been ruined by . Megan's rare condition. Treatment: The schoolgirl must now take a cocktail of drugs to quell her condition, Cyclical Vomiting Syndrome . Mrs Harvey said: 'This summer Megan stayed at a friends house and camped in the garden. There were around 15 girls and again Megan got sick. 'Because she was comatose and vomiting her friends all thought she had got drunk and teased her.

"By . Mia De Graaf . A man who stole £3,500 of charity money from his terminally ill daughter has been jailed. Ashanti Elliott-Smith, 11, suffers from a rare disease that makes her look 80 and will likely not live past 15. She was given the donation from Sussex British Motorcycle Owners Club (SBMOC) in 2010 so she could go for a once-in-a-lifetime trip to swim with dolphins. Scroll down for video . Jailed: Albi Elliott, 44, (pictured with his terminally ill daughter Ashanti) spent £3,500 donated to the family so she could go on the trip of a lifetime in America . But her father Albi Elliott, 44, hid the money from the rest of the family and within two months had spent it - on trips to Tesco. Blasting his actions as 'callous and despicably devious', the judge at Chichester Crown Court jailed Elliott for three years. The court heard Ashanti, who has Hutchinson-Gildford Progeria, was selected by her local biking club in West Sussex to receive a year's worth of charity money to go on her dream holiday. At every event she attended, she was accompanied by her father Elliott, who claimed her mother Phoebe Smith, his ex, was ill or busy. When they were finally presented with the money in December 2010 he told organisers to put the cheque in his name to book the trip. Plight: Ashanti Elliott-Smith, 11, suffers from the ageing disease Progeria and is unlikely to live past 15 . Betrayed: Her mother Phoebe Smith knew nothing about the donation until after her ex-partner had used it . But two . months later, Ashanti and her mother attended an event at the club - and . when organisers mentioned the money, she knew nothing about it. Distraught, Ms Smith told The Sun: . 'Knowing he stole from her killed me inside. To me it's the same as . abuse, and it's heartbreaking for Ashanti to know he has ruined her . wish.' Defending his actions, Elliott told the jury he was saving the money in his mother's safe for Ashanti's funeral. A fatal genetic disease, Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome accelerates the appearance of ageing. It is commonly referred to simply as Progeria, the Greek word for 'prematurely old'. It is caused by a mutation in the gene called LMNA, which produces protein. Children with Progeria are born looking healthy and start showing signs at 18 months. Symptoms include stunted growth, hair loss, weight loss, wrinkled skin, stiff joints, and heart disease. Sufferers commonly die of heart disease at an average age of 13 years old. But when police approached his parents, they said they had not seen their son for four years. He then claimed to have buried the thousands of pounds in his garden. Again, police found nothing. Clive Etherington, SBMOC social secretary, said: 'It is disgusting. We never had any reason to suspect him. 'We met Ashanti in 2009 and we were really moved by her situation. We heard she wanted to go to America so planned a year of events - fun runs, curry nights, quiz nights... anything. 'A lot of the members put a lot of their own money into it. 'Albi brought Ashanti to every event and told us her mum, Phoebe, was ill. How would we know he was lying? He seemed to be looking after her fine. 'On the final day, a 60s themed charity Christmas party, we gave her a big cheque for £3,500, and he asked us to put the name A Elliott on it. 'We hadn't heard anything so in February when Ashanti's mother came to the club we asked her about their plans. It turned out she knew nothing about it. 'It is disgusting, a really sad sad case.' Presentation: This is the moment Ashanti and Albi were presented with the cheque at the biking club party . Organisers said Elliott seemed doting when he and Ashanti's sister Brandy Louse (left) came to the event . Shaken by the experience, the club now refuses to sponsor any individual cases. 'It is really sad. There are so many people that need help that we want to help, but this has scared our members. 'How do we know where our money is going? We want to get the money back and pay for the trip ourselves, but it doesn't look like we can. It is just really, really sad.'","Ashanti Elliott-Smith, 11, has Progeria disease which accelerates ageing .

"By . Leesa Smith . Now that cars are more reliable than ever before – cyclists are going to be the new target for roadside assistance in NSW over the next couple of years as the established Victorian program is closely monitored to develop a strategy. After experiencing a 7.3 per cent drop in roadside job requests last year due to cars breaking down  every two or three years now instead of yearly, the NRMA is planning to reach out to people using bikes to boost their membership numbers. An NRMA spokeswoman said there was a need for diversification within the company’s services but it was a few years away before the cyclist program will be offered. ‘Our database is going to start looking at following people rather than following number plates,’ she said. 'We are not at a stage where we can speculate on premiums - we are watching other clubs and how they roll it out before we do our own strategy, so technically it’s on the cards at some point but we are just not sure of the details or when.'

The NRMA is monitoring groups such as RACV Bike Assist which operates in Victoria where a taxi can be ordered for the member and their bike if the problem can’t be fixed roadside. The membership rates for NSW cyclists is not known at this early stage but the assistance provided for RACV members varies from $33 - $59 depending on whether you take out single or family cover. The company has already broadened its horizons by offering an emergency home assist service with gives members eight visits per year by a tradesperson to fix common household problems such as faulty taps and blocked toilets for $190. Also a Living Well Navigator website will be launching next month for people over 50 to use as an online resource with information including public transport, pension and job as well as a social community forum. 'The need for roadside assistance remains, but we also provide specialised battery replacement , technical support via phone, and at members' homes,' the spokeswoman said.

"By . Leesa Smith . Tasmanian mum Nicole Cowles is hopeful the rising groundswell of support for the legalisation of medicinal marijuana could stop her having to obtain illegally from interstate drug dealers to help the suffering of her daughter Alice Agnew, who is just eight.‘I’m seeing Alice for who she really is – I only saw glimpses of her before,’ Ms Cowles said about the improvement of her daughter since she started taking the liquid form of cannabis four times a day in February to help control her seizures.The family is one of 200 across the country who are forced to import the cannabis from a supplier in Kempsey in NSW which is free of charge but the waiting list is sitting at 1,500 with people desperate to get their hands on the drug to relieve chronic pain and aid with seizures. Scroll down for video . Alice Agnew, 8, pictured in hospital after having seizures when she went off the medicinal cannabis for a few weeks in April . Alice's mother Nicole Cowles said she is getting to know her eight year-old daughter for the first time . This week, governments in NSW, Queensland and Tasmania, where Alice lives, all signalled they would support law reform which would allow chronically-ill patients to take cannabis to relieve their suffering. Clinical trials of medicinal cannabis could happen in NSW, but Premier Mike Baird is waiting on details about regulation and supply before making any commitments. Under a private member's bill to be introduced next month by Nationals MP Kevin Anderson, terminally-ill people and their carers will be legally able to carry up to 15 grams of cannabis. Mr Baird indicated his support after meeting Daniel Haslam, a 24-year-old who in 2010 was told he would only live for a few more months. When asked if he would support a clinical trial, as proposed by the Australian Medical Association, Mr Baird said 'it may well be something we have to do'. I'm open to that,' he told ABC Radio on Thursday. After rejecting a medicinal cannabis trial earlier this month, the Tasmanian government has announced it would be prepared to support the findings of an Upper House inquiry into medicinal cannabis. The renewed push to relax the laws comes as a new poll reveals two thirds of Australian’s support the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes. It’s unlikely there will be any change to the legislation in Victoria with the State government and the opposition admitting they have no immediate plans to legalise the drug . Earlier this month, pregnant mother of one Cassie Batten was questioned by Victorian police over the use of cannabis oil to treat her epileptic three year old son. Ms Cowles (left) said Alice (right) has significantly improved both physically and mentally since taking liquid cannabis . Alice (right) with her brother Josh (left) is interacting more with others . Ms Cowles said the government getting on board with running trials would help save her daughter's life who doesn't get seizures now unless she is unwell. She said the regulation of medicinal cannabis would prevent families being left with no choice but to access the drug - which has the THC removed that gives the high - illegally. ‘There is such a demand that families will end up going out and getting it anyway they can – even from a drug dealer down the road,’ she said. 'There has been an obvious significant improvement in Alice both physically and mentally - she's interacting so much more.' When Alice was taken off the medication for a few weeks in April, she ended up in hospital after having the worst seizures she had endured for quite some time, her mother said. Ms Cowles receives the medicinal marijuana at no charge from Tony Bower who is facing court next week after almost 70 plants confiscated from his property in Kempsey in NSW about four months ago. Ms Cowles (back) doesn't want families to resort to accessing marijuana from dealers off the street . Mr Bower has been charged for breaching his good behaviour bond after he was first charged three years ago for cultivating the marijuana. He could now be facing up to two years in court. ‘If I go to jail – parents are going to watch their children die - I don’t have an option,’ he said speaking of the horrendous side affects children can suffer from anti-convulsion medication including loss of taste and smell and even blindness. Mr Bower said he has about 200 people who he sends the cannabis to with at least 130 of them being children - but his waiting list is as long as 1,500. ‘I mainly only take children now - the quicker you get to them and stop the seizures - they don’t get the brain damage,’ he said. ‘People don’t realise the drugs they put them on straight away have massive side effects – kids can be blind within a couple of days.’","Nicole Cowles hopes growing support for legalisation of medicinal marijuana could stop her having to obtaining illegally for her daughter .

"By . Leesa Smith . When 16-year-old John Dwan picked up a metal object on his grandfather’s property he had no idea that it could have been the end of his very young life. But the boy soon realised after he showed his grandfather Barry Dwan who immediately recognised the object as a World War II mortar shell. The naturally curious teenager dug up the object which was sticking out of the ground and threw it in his ute at the Warwick property near Morgan Park on Tuesday. ‘He knew automatically what it was and put it behind a tree and called the police,’ John told MailOnline. 'I had no idea what it was – I just picked it up and put it in my ute because it looked unusual.’ John Dwan found a World War II mortar shell on his grandfather's property in Warwick and put it in his ute . The young welder said he felt lucky when his astounded grandfather explained the dangers of the bomb. ‘He said it could have blown up me and my ute – he couldn’t believe it,’ he said. In no time at all Mr Dwan’s property near Morgan Park in Queensland resembled a surreal crime scene with at least ten police officers securing the area . The police guarded the mortar shell until two Australian Army officers attended to dispose of the bomb. John and his grandfather watched on as the army officers placed the bomb deep underground and then detonated it. ‘It was really loud and left a big hole about one metre deep and two or three foot wide,’ John said. ‘The army officers showed me photos of bombs and grenades in case I see anymore.’ Both army officers described the blast as impressive and said John was extremely lucky to be alive and to be able to tell his story. When the 16 year-old showed his grandfather Barry Dwan immediately recognised the object as a World War II mortar shell and called the police . His mother Shelly Dwan was very distressed at the thought of what could have happened to her son. ‘I’m absolutely devastated that my son came across something like that – it’s very upsetting,’ she said. ‘John is a very smart boy but he has obviously has never seen anything like this – I don’t think I’ve seen anything like this at my age either.’ During World War II an Australian Army’s detention Barracks was located on the south side of Warwick, east of the New England Highway and north of Flitcroft Street. The Detention Barracks at Warwick were reputedly the scene of violent riots during the war. Two Australian army officers placed the bomb deep underground and then detonated it .","John Dwan found a World War II mortar shell on his grandfather's property in Warwick, Queensland .

"By . Leesa Smith . and Aap . Prime Minister Tony Abbott said the Australian government would not be subjected to 'moral blackmail' when it comes to assessing who is given asylum in Australia following reports nine mothers on Christmas Island attempted suicide in the hope their children would by allowed to stay. The latest claims come as the government finally admitted in the High Court that they had intercepted a ship carrying 153 Sri Lankan asylum seekers in the Indian Ocean outside Australian territorial waters. At the detention centre on Christmas Island, reports have emerged of at least nine Sri Lankan mothers attempting to take their own lives in the past week once told by immigration officials that they would never resettle in Australia due to arriving before July 19, 2013, The Sydney Morning Herald reports. Scroll down for video . Sri Lankan asylum seekers prepare to enter the magistrate's court in the southern port district of Galle on Tuesday . The 41 refugees face court after being handed back to their country by Australia when a boat was intercepted off Cocos Island in late June - although their government declared they would not risk persecution if returned . Maurice Blackburn lawyer Jacob Varghese, who represents 72 asylum seeker babies, said the women were in a ‘state of utter despair’ about the welfare of their children. Mr Abbott said he had not seen the report, but added: ""If true, it is a harrowing tale"". However, he said the government would not capitulate to 'moral blackmail' when it came to border protection. 'This is not going to be a government which has our policy driven by people who are attempting to hold us over a moral barrel - we won't be driven by that,' he told the Nine Network on Wednesday. 'No Australian government should be subjected to the spectacle of people saying ""Unless you accept us, I am going to commit self harm"".' Officials told the High Court that a boat carrying the refugees had been intercepted last week. They are still on the customs vessel in the Indian Ocean outside Australian territorial waters while their fate is decided. The government promised to give three days' notice before attempting to return the group, which includes about 40 children, some as young as two. Meanwhile, 41 asylum seekers who were handed back to Sri Lanka by Australia appeared in court to face charges of attempting to leave the country illegally. Five remained in custody while 27 were granted bail. Nine children were discharged.

Tony Abbott defends Australia's policy of turning back boats after High Court STOPS government handing 153 asylum seekers over to Sri Lanka . Government has returned 41 asylum seekers detained in June to Sri Lanka despite fears their lives could be in danger . The Sri Lankan group was charged for attempting to leave the country illegally with 27 granted bail and five remanded in custody while nine children were discharged . Meanwhile, up to one dozen Sri Lankan mothers have attempted suicide on Christmas Island in the hope that their then orphaned children would get to reside in Australia . Late on Monday, the High Court granted an urgent temporary injunction preventing the return of the 153 to Sri Lanka ahead of Tuesday's hearing in Melbourne, where Commonwealth Solicitor-General Justin Gleeson undertook to give 72 hours' notice before moving them. Refugee rights activist Ian Rintoul said the decision will come as an ‘enormous relief’ to the asylum seekers. ‘It is only a temporary fix, but it's blown a bit of a hole in the government's treatment of asylum seekers,’ he said. The government had previously declined to reveal any details about the boat, citing its longstanding policy not to comment about on-water operations. But Mr Gleeson told the High Court on Tuesday Australian authorities had intercepted the boat 12 miles from Australian territorial waters which meant their future would be determined by the Maritime Powers Act, not the Migration Act. The matter will return to court within 21 days for a directions hearing. There are also 153 Sri Lankan asylum seekers held onboard the Australian customs vessel in the Indian Ocean since being intercepted in the last week .

"By . Leesa Smith . A 21-year-old man who was deported from China arrived in handcuffs at Adelaide airport on Friday night to be charged for bashing his mother to death three years ago. Wei Li,was arrested at Sydney airport on Friday morning after arriving on an Air China flight from Beijing. He later appeared via videolink in a Sydney court which ordered his extradition to South Australia. Li will be charged with the murder of his mother, 41-year-old Emma Mei Tian, before appearing in the Adelaide Magistrates Court on Monday. Wei Li, 21, who was deported from China, arrived in handcuffs at Adelaide airport on Friday night to be charged with brutally bashing his mother to death three years ago . An Australia-wide travel alert was issued by South Australian police for Li who had been named as the murder suspect after the brutally bashed body of Ms Tian was found in her suburban Burnside home on March 19, 2011. However, when federal police called to say the student had turned up at Melbourne Airport, their calls to two SA police mobile phones went unanswered, with the messages not retrieved until the next day, by which time Li had already left the country. Detective Inspector Greg Hutchins admitted on Friday that the disappearance of Li was not handled appropriately at the time. Following a three-year manhunt, Chinese authorities recently advised their Australian counterparts Li was in China without a valid visa and would be deported to Australia. Li's movements in China in the past three years were unknown,Det Insp Hutchins added. Ms Tian's husband, who was in China on business at the time of the killing, was struggling to cope with the news of his son's arrest, he said. ‘On one hand his son will be charged with murder once he arrives back in Adelaide, and on the other hand it was his wife who was murdered - he is finding it difficult at the present time,’ he said. Assistant Commissioner Paul Dickson described the arrest as a significant development. ‘Murder investigations never close and this arrest demonstrates SAPOL's commitment to ensure offenders are held accountable for their actions,’ he said. Ms Tian's body, which was wrapped tightly in bedding, was found by a friend in an upstairs bedroom.

"By . Leesa Smith . In the same week that a family signed a 20-year lease to live on St Bees Island, one woman was so desperate to get off the private oasis that her friends made a huge SOS sign in the sand. The 62-year-old woman fell out of a coconut tree on Thursday and had to be airlifted off the island with spinal injuries after landing on a rock. Her friends made the SOS sign along with a cross and and arrow to help rescue choppers easily locate them on the island just off the coast of Mackay, north Queensland. Scroll down for video . Desperate measures: The injured woman's friends resorted to writing SOS in the sand after she fell from a coconut tree . The RACQ-CQ was so impressed with the forethought of the group that they were praised on Twitter. ‘Landing spot on #StBeesIsland made much easier to find by a big SOS in the sand. 2nd time this has helped this year!’. In April, five people left stranded after their boat broke anchor 30km's north-east of Mackay were also rescued after emergency crews spotted their SOS message written on a sandbank. Meanwhile, the new leaseholders of paradise will be the sole occupants of St Bees Island, which features three sea shanty-style cottages, a 100,000-litre water supply, a power generator and lots of coconut trees. 'There's not a lot to it, it's quite simple,' Mackay and Marina Real Estate licensee Kim Griffiths told Daily Mail Australia. The new leaseholders will be the sole occupants of St Bees Island which is just off Mackay - north of Brisbane . A Gold Coast family signed a 20-year lease for less than $1 million this week . A Gold Coast woman, her son and partner will be moving to the 1,100-hectare island. However the residential lease covers about 4 hectares as the rest of the land is a national park. Mr Griffiths described the couple, in their 60s, as 'quite eccentrically private'. 'They just had the normal reservations in terms of isolation – when living a metropolitan style life you attach yourself to lifestyle habits but I think they're just looking forward to living a simple island life that most of us only fantasise about,' he said. 'They're heading towards the island now and they're bringing up a convoy of boats to potter around on and she's going to grow veggies.'

The island was originally owned by the Bourke family but the surviving holder of the lease took on some partners and formed a local syndicate of businessmen. 'They used it for family holidays for about 5 or 10 years and then they wanted to go their separate ways and so they put it on the market,' Mr Griffiths said. The Gold Coast family were among hundreds of inquiries which were mostly from Australia and New Zealand but also generated interests from Europe and Asia.

"By . James Chapman . and Hugo Duncan . Ministers hailed a ‘major milestone’ last night as official figures showed Britain’s economy has reached a record high – surpassing its peak before the recession. David Cameron said the fact that the economy is now larger than it was before the financial crisis of 2008 was a ‘credit’ to the hard work of British workers and businesses. The pace of economic recovery over the last year has taken experts by surprise, after the worst downturn for at least a century. Scroll down for video . Britain's economy grew by 0.8 per cent in the three months to June, taking the total size of the economy back to levels not seen since before the financial crisis hit in 2007 . It has taken much longer for the UK economy to return to pre-crash levels than it did after recessions in the 1970s and 1990s . The International Monetary Fund, which had already admitted that it was wrong to warn that Chancellor George Osborne’s austerity measures would choke off recovery, this week forecast Britain’s economy would surge by 3.2 per cent this year, outstripping every other major economy in the world. Total output across the UK rose by a healthy 0.8 per cent between April and June – meaning the economy is now 0.2 per cent bigger than it was in early 2008, before the crisis. But GDP per capita – the size of the economy divided by the population – is still 5.5 per cent below the pre-recession peak. Ministers hailed ‘a big day for Britain’ following the deepest slump in post-war history. Gross domestic product – the total size of the economy – crashed by 7.2 per cent under Labour in 2008-09 as the financial crisis took its toll on families and businesses. It has taken more than six years for output to return to its pre-recession peak, bringing the longest downturn for at least 100 years to an end. The Prime Minister said: ‘It is good news that, after all the hard work of the British people, the economy is now bigger than it was before the crash.’ Mr Osborne added: ‘Today we reach a major milestone in our long-term economic plan. But there is still a long way to go – the Great Recession was one of the deepest of any major economy and cost Britain six years.’ Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said: ‘Today is a big day for Britain. The rescue has worked.’ He claimed the economy had been brought ‘back from the brink’ because of the actions of the Coalition. Chancellor George Osborne welcomed the news, but insisted there is still much more work to be done . After repeatedly issuing doom-laden warnings about the dangers of Mr Osborne’s plans, Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls conceded: ‘At long last our economy is back to the size it was before the global banking crisis – three years after the US reached the same point.’ But he added: ‘Wages after inflation are down over £1,600 a year since 2010, housebuilding under this government is at its lowest level since the 1920s and business investment is lagging behind our competitors.’ The recovery has raised the prospect that interest rates – which have been frozen at 0.5 per cent since March 2009 – will rise before the end of the year. ...as RBS profits surge to £2.7billion . More than £2billion was added to the value of Royal Bank of Scotland yesterday after it said the economic recovery had driven a dramatic surge in profits. The state-backed lender was forced to rush out a statement to the stock market a week early because its performance so far this year has been much better than expected. Profits almost doubled to £2.7billion in the first half of the year, compared with the same period last year. This is its biggest half-year profit since it received a £46billion bailout from taxpayers in 2008. The jump in profits drove shares up 35.40p to 364.20p. But this is still some way short of the 500p ‘break even’ price paid for the shares during the bailout. Chief executive Ross McEwan appeared to caution against an early sale of the Government’s 82 per cent stake in the bank, saying that RBS was facing ‘significant conduct and litigation issues that will hit our profits’.","The British economy grew by 0.8% between April and June, ONS says .

"By . Leesa Smith . The first images of the Australian Submarine AE2 wreckage, lost more than 99 years ago at the bottom of the ocean in Turkey, have been captured by a high-definition camera and sophisticated lighting. The roving camera used to inspect the wreck 73 metres below the Sea of Marmara reveals that the submarine is still in surprisingly good condition since being lost to Turkish gunfire from the Ottoman torpedo boat Sultanhisar on 30 April 1915. Since the submarine was found by a Turkish maritime archaeologist in 1996, a joint Australian and Turkish initiative has been in full swing to access the wreckage without disturbing the site and the long process was finally achieved last month. The hatch of the AE2 submarine being opened for the first time in 99 years . The AE2 was found in surprisingly good condition last month after being torpedoed 73 metres to the bottom of the Sea of Marmara in 1915 . A fish sticking its head out of the hatch of the submarine . Divers verified the site in 1998 before Silent ANZAC project began with a team of Australian submariners, scientists from the Defence Science and Technology Organisation and the US Remotely Operated Vehicle designers, SeaBotix. Project leader and Chair of the AE2 Commemorative Foundation, Rear Admiral Peter Briggs said the camera  captured the entire length of the submarine including her forward and aft hydroplanes, rudder and tops of her propellers. ‘The submarine interior is in amazingly good condition, original paint, signalman's sand shoes (plimsolls) still stowed in the flag locker in the conning tower along with the flags and what we believe was the battle ensign used by Lieutenant Commander, Henry ‘Dacre’ Stoker, DSO, 99 years ago,’ he said. RADM Briggs said one of the most significant discoveries of the exercise was a portable Wireless Telegraph pole and antenna wire, the existence of which had long been the subject of discussion of military historians. ‘It is most likely that it was this telegraph which transmitted the message to Army headquarters that AE2 had torpedoed an Ottoman gunboat at Çanakkale,’ he said. RADM Briggs said there were many hiccups along the way as the process was inevitably challenging. The diving team first practiced in 12 metres of water in Corio Bay in Geelong last year and then again in Turkey for three days before the real dive last month . The process was painstakingly slow with the wet diving bell, that transported the two divers down to the sea floor, taking four hours and only allowed the divers 20 minutes to work before going back up to the surface again . The diving team first practiced in 12 metres of water in Corio Bay in Geelong last year and then again in Turkey for three days before the real dive last month. ‘We built a mock-up of the conning tower and its control room and we dropped that on the bottom alongside our ship, which took four days to mobilise, in 12 metres of water and practiced with the Turkish diving team,’ he said. 'Then we took the ship down for 10 days but we lost one day through bad weather.' 'So we had to find the submarine again and then moor the ship with four buoys so it could adjust its position very accurately and let us work on various sites on the submarine,’ he said.

HMAS AE2 was the first Allied submarine to penetrate the Dardanelles strait at 2.30 am on April 25 in 1915 as part of the Gallipoli Campaign, on the morning the ANZAC soldiers landed at Anzac Cove. After five hectic days ‘running amok’, she finally fell to Turkish gunfire from the Ottoman torpedo boat Sultanhisar on 30 April 1915 and was scuttled. All of AE2’s crew were rescued by the Sultanhisar crew before the submarine slid down to the sea floor. The submarine lay unseen until 1998 when she was discovered, intact, in 73m of water in the Sea of Marmara. His Majesty's Australian Submarine AE2 was launched in the yard of Vickers Ltd at Barrow-in-Furness England on 18 June 1913.

"By . James Chapman . David Cameron yesterday urged France to abandon a contract to sell warships to Vladimir Putin. Calling for an economic cold war, the Prime Minister urged other EU leaders to agree tough sanctions against Moscow. He insisted there should be an embargo on commercial dealings with Russian defence, banking, energy and aviation firms. Scroll down for video . Anger: David Cameron vows to bring tough sanctions on Moscow after emergency talks in Brussels . Sanctions: Putin, pictured examining aviation equipment yesterday, was at the receiving end of a stern 30-minute rant from David Cameron on Sunday. He now faces tough embargoes levied by the EU . Ahead of emergency talks in Brussels today, he insisted the EU should also freeze the assets of the Russian president’s allies, whom he referred to as cronies and oligarchs. Mr Cameron told MPs it had been shown beyond doubt that Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 was shot down by an SA11 missile fired by separatists trained and armed by Moscow in a conflict ‘fomented’ by Russia. Evoking the spectre of Nazi aggression in the 1930s and 40s, he added: ‘Those of us in Europe should not need to be reminded of the consequences of turning a blind eye when big countries bully smaller countries. 'We will lose diplomatic and economic security if we do not confront the fact that one country in Europe is now being destabilised by Russia, and if we let this happen, others will follow.' Earlier this year, Prince Charles prompted controversy by likening Mr Putin to Adolf Hitler. Mr Cameron questioned France’s plan to sell Mistral helicopter carriers to Russia, suggesting it was ‘unthinkable’ after the downing of the Malaysian jet. From France with love: This is part of the Sevastopol ship under construction in Saint-Nazaire, western France, for the Russian navy. It was pictued arriving from the Baltic on July 15 . Close: Putin and billionaire Arkady Rotenberg who has been been blacklisted by US sanctions . Asked about France’s plan to press ahead with a £1billion contract, the Prime Minister said: ‘Frankly in this country it would be unthinkable to fulfil an order like the one outstanding that the French have. ‘We cannot go on doing business as usual with a country when it is behaving in this way. 'Russia cannot expect to continue enjoying access to European markets, European capital, European knowledge and technical expertise while she fuels conflict in one of Europe’s neighbours.’ His remarks will embarrass France’s socialist president Francois Hollande, who has refused to intervene to cancel the delivery of the vessels to Moscow, despite pressure to do so from the US even before the downing of MH17. Former Cabinet minister Kenneth Clarke said: ‘If this outrageous [Russian] behaviour is not met with truly effective sanctions, the West faces very grave problems in the next few years from Russian behaviour across the rest of central and eastern Europe, including the Balkan states and the Baltic states inside the [European] Union itself.’ Conservative MP Colonel Bob Stewart, ex-commander of UN forces in Bosnia, said Nato should now position troops in the Balkan republics and Poland. Anne Marie Morris, another Tory MP, suggested Russia should be stripped of the right to hold the 2018 World Cup. Grim cargo: Ukrainian rescue workers remove bagged bodies of the 298 MH17 victims from the village of Grabovo in eastern Ukraine where the plane came down. The area is controlled by pro-Russian separatists . Safety: Emergency workers put on protective gear to handle the victims, many of whom were badly burned . Ed Miliband, in Washington for a brief meeting with US president Barack Obama, said Europe faced a moment of reckoning. ‘We know enough about this disaster to know that this is a moment when Europe needs to show its strength as well as its sorrow,’ he added. ‘EU foreign ministers meeting this week must take the first decisive steps to tighten and extend sanctions, not just against specific individuals, but against Russian commercial organisations, unless and until President Putin ceases all support for the separatists in eastern Ukraine and halts the supply of arms across the Russian border.’ Despite Mr Cameron’s rhetoric, diplomatic sources played down the prospect of a major escalation of sanctions at today’s meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels. It was not immediately known what the Malaysian team would do with the black boxes, but there was speculation they would pass the boxes on to experts with experience of reading the data . A Malaysian investigator, left, takes a black box as it is handed over by a Donetsk People's Republic official in the city of Donetsk . Other member states are said to be nervous about the economic impact of cutting Russia off. Stefan Hedlund, an expert on Russia based at Uppsala University in Sweden, said a full-scale economic confrontation between the West and Russia could be devastating. ‘The Russian economy would be thrown into severe recession, the Ukrainian economy would collapse, and all hopes for a recovery in the eurozone would be put off for several years,’ he said. Last night the UN Security Council adopted a resolution calling for a full and independent investigation into the MH17 disaster.","Embargo defence, banking, energy and air deals, Prime Minister said .

"By . James Chapman . Fond farewell: A relaxed Kenneth Clarke arrives at 10 Downing Street yesterday . Kenneth Clarke, a titan of Tory politics for more than four decades, quit the Cabinet last night with a parting blast over Europe. The minister without portfolio – who has previously served as Chancellor, Home Secretary, Health Secretary, Education Secretary and Justice Secretary – told David Cameron that, at 74, he wanted to become a ‘veteran backbencher’. And he warned Mr Cameron that he intended to campaign ‘vigorously’ for Britain to remain in the EU ahead of the Prime Minister’s promised referendum. Mr Clarke said the case for staying in the EU was ‘stronger’ than ever in a ‘dangerously disturbed’ world and an increasingly globalised economy. His European views – out of step with the prevailing mood of Tory Euroscepticism – are widely seen to have cost him the party leadership, which he stood for on three occasions between 1997 and 2005. The veteran MP for Rushcliffe, who has held office in every Conservative government since 1972, has been joking with colleagues in recent days that he was looking forward to watching more cricket. And he told ITV News last night that he had been ‘demob-happy’ for several weeks. Returning to his beloved cricket, he said he had enjoyed a ‘good long innings’ and confessed that he had spent far more time watching England’s first Test against India at Trent Bridge last week than in his office. ‘I thought I’d do a couple of years in this government. That was the agreement I had with David [Cameron]. I’ve done four and that’s obviously enough, and it makes sense to have a reshuffle,’ Mr Clarke said. Law student: A young Kenneth Clarke at Cambridge University . Minister: In the year he left the Health Department to be Employment Secretary . Chancellor: Outside No 11 Downing Street during his four years leading the treasury . Contender: Enjoying a pint and a cigar as he runs for the Tory leadership . As a ‘life-long addict to politics’, he said he was ‘as keen as ever’ to carry on as an MP and promised to be ‘largely supportive’ of the Government from the backbenches. Mr Clarke, who entered parliament in 1970 and secured his first job as a whip in 1972 in Edward Heath’s government, was brought back to the Tory frontbench in 2009 at the behest of Chancellor George Osborne. He had been on the backbenches throughout the Conservative wilderness years after 1997, not serving under William Hague, Iain Duncan Smith or Michael Howard. His appointment as shadow business secretary was designed to counter Gordon Brown’s surprise decision to bring back one of Labour’s big beasts, Peter Mandelson, to the Cabinet. Last night, Mr Clarke wrote to Mr Cameron telling him: ‘I would wish to retire from ministerial office in your Government’. He said he had ‘greatly enjoyed’ his return in a Government ‘that has had to face the worst financial crisis of my lifetime, and the aftermath of the deepest and longest recession since the war’. He added: ‘I believe that we have saved the country from economic disaster, although we have a long way to go before we have the modern, healthy and competitive economy that the next generation needs. ‘I have always been a radical reformer of public services and I think that people will look back on our achievements in modernising the health service and education service and the welfare system in a favourable way.’ He added: ‘However, I have just celebrated my 74th birthday and I have been doing red boxes at night for a high proportion of my adult life. There are plenty of other able people who could take on the work that I was doing in Government and I think the time has come to return to being a veteran backbencher.’ Mr Clarke gave notice to the Prime Minister that he intends to remain ‘an active’ member of the Commons. ‘My belief in Britain’s membership of the European Union remains as firm as ever and I think the political and economic case is made even stronger in today’s globalised economy and dangerously disturbed world,’ he said. ‘I know that you are quite determined to have a referendum on the subject, in which I will be campaigning vigorously for a vote to keep us in the Union.’ Ben Wallace, Mr Clarke’s parliamentary private secretary, said: ‘He is the most honest politician I have ever met.’","The stalwart politician, 74, told PM he wants to be a 'veteran backbencher'

"By . James Chapman . Overlooked: TUC boss Frances O'Grady believes politicians should stop ignoring 'sensible proposals' to increase secret ballot turnouts . Union leaders yesterday called for Margaret Thatcher’s anti-strike laws to be unpicked to allow ballots on industrial action to take place in the workplace and on the internet. They claimed the reason turnouts in recent strike ballots were so poor was because they have to be conducted by postal vote, with papers sent to members’ homes. TUC boss Frances O’Grady said: ‘Instead of imposing a ballot threshold that not a single MP met in the last election, politicians should stop ignoring sensible proposals to increase secret ballot turnouts at the workplace and online. ‘It is hard to see how an offer to depress living standards for the foreseeable future and stop people doing anything about it will win votes at the next election.’ Mick Cash, acting general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, warned of wildcat strikes if changes are made to balloting laws. ‘If you remove the right to strike legally or make it almost impossible, then workers will, understandably, take matters into their own hands,’ he said. ‘If a majority of workers in a democratic, secret ballot decide to take action as last resort over their safety or jobs but the Government or a judge says you can’t do that because you’ve not reached a threshold or because this is an essential service, it is obvious how workers with a proud militant tradition will react. ‘They will eventually take their own action and you will see highly disruptive wildcat action called at very short or no notice.’ Though yesterday’s strikes were based on ballots held in some cases several years ago, which saw low turnout from members, union leaders insisted their action was ‘valid and lawful’. Business leaders are pressing for a new law setting a target of at least 50 per cent of those balloted having to vote in favour.

"By . James Chapman . and Daniel Martin . Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has told David Cameron he is not going anywhere in a wider than expected Government reshuffle due next week. A string of big names in the Cabinet are expected to be axed or moved in the last shake-up by the Prime Minister before next year’s general election. Some of the older men in the Cabinet dubbed ‘the old lags’ will be sacked or will announce their retirements after long stints in Cabinet. Overhaul: Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has told David Cameron he is not going anywhere during next week's reshuffle. Work and Pensions minister Esther McVey has been tipped for a position . Veteran minister Kenneth Clarke is expected to go, as is Chief Whip Sir George Young and leader of the Commons Andrew Lansley. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles is also said to be vulnerable, along with Environment Secretary Owen Paterson and Welsh Secretary David Jones. The Prime Minister wants to make way for fresh faces, most of them women. Schools minister Elizabeth Truss and Work and Pensions minister Esther McVey are hotly tipped to enter the Cabinet. Mr Duncan Smith has been at the centre . of repeated speculation that he is being lined up for a ‘job swap’ with . Defence Secretary Philip Hammond. Leader of the Commons Andrew Lansley,  pictured left, is expected to go in the reshuffle while one source has suggested Eric Pickles, right, could be the next Chief Whip . Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, pictured, has been at the centre of repeated speculation that he is being lined up for a 'job swap' with Mr Duncan Smith . Allies of Mr Duncan Smith – who is overseeing the most fundamental reform of the welfare state for half a century – said he had no intention of leaving his post. ‘He and Cameron have agreed – he’s not going anywhere,’ said a source. Other rising stars, including backbencher Priti Patel and whip Amber Rudd, are in line for more junior ministerial posts. Nicky Morgan and Penny Mordaunt are also being touted for promotion. David Cameron is expected to put the finishing touches to his cabinet reshuffle this weekend - and it is expected to be more extensive than first though. Here are some of the key figures expected to either make way for fresh faces, move to different departments or climb the ministerial ladder in the shake-up, which will be announced on Monday or Tuesday. Iain Duncan Smith has told allies he has no intention of leaving his post . Iain Duncan Smith . Current position: Pensions Secretary. There have been rumours that he could face the sack following a series of disputes with Chancellor George Osborne. Mr Duncan Smith has told allies he has no intention of leaving the post.

Former Cabinet minister Liam Fox and . former immigration minister Mark Harper are being considered for a . return to Government, sources say. Their names are also in the frame for . a new chief whip. One MP said he expected Mr Pickles to . become chief whip, Culture Secretary Sajid Javid to move to Communities . and Local Government, and Miss McVey to enter the Cabinet at culture. Mr Cameron has been stung by claims that he has a ‘women problem’. The . desire to promote more women is designed to counter this impression and . meet a pledge that a third of government members should be female. Expected to go?

Welsh Secretary David Jones, pictured left, is tipped to go in the Cabinet reshuffle along with Environment secretary Owen Paterson, right . One minister said the reshuffle was being drawn up by the all-powerful Chancellor. ‘This is George Osborne’s reshuffle, as always. 'That creates its own dynamics and its own problems. 'If you are looking at weak links, Lansley is possibly the weakest of all. ‘There are problems with trying to elevate all these women for PR reasons,’ the minister added. ‘Promoting people who have been in Parliament for five minutes into the Cabinet will backfire.’ Of . the prospect of Mr Duncan Smith being shifted, the minister said it . would be ‘hard to turn down defence – a dream job for most’. Rising star: Penny Mordaunt, pictured, is being touted for a potential promotion in the junior ranks . In line for promotion? Priti Patel, left, a member of the Downing Street policy board, could be in line for a step up the ministerial ladder. Elizabeth Truss, pictured right, an education minister, is tipped for a Cabinet post . Mr Duncan Smith has clashed in the past with the Chancellor, who wants to cut billions more from the welfare budget in the next Parliament. Mr Osborne was said to have been behind the botched attempt to move the Work and Pensions Secretary to justice in 2012. Mr Duncan Smith has been under pressure in recent months over delays to his flagship welfare reform, which will combine separate benefits into one ‘Universal Credit’. The reshuffle is expected to take place next Monday or Tuesday, before the Commons summer recess. Possible candidate: Theresa Villiers, Northern Ireland Secretary has been suggested for the role . David Cameron is considering putting forward a woman to take one of Europe’s top jobs. He was said to be looking for a suitable female candidate to be Britain’s next EU Commissioner amid hints from Jean-Claude Juncker, the newly-elected President of the European Commission, that women will get the best jobs. Among possible candidates for the role are Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers and former Sunday Telegraph editor Patience Wheatcroft. There have even been calls for Home Secretary Theresa May to be offered the Brussels role. Miss Villiers was a member of the European Parliament between 1999 and 2005, during which time she served as deputy leader of the Conservative group. If she is given the job she would have to resign as an MP, sparking a by-election in her marginal North London seat. Baroness Wheatcroft, a former financial journalist who was appointed a Tory peer in 2010, may therefore be a safer bet because she would not force a by-election. There have also been rumours that the British Commissioner job could go to Michael Howard, the former Tory leader and Home Secretary while others have suggested Michael Fallon, a minister in the business and energy departments. Others in the frame include Defence Secretary Philip Hammond and Environment Secretary Owen Paterson. The current British representative in Europe is Labour peer Baroness Cathy Ashton, whose job is EU foreign policy chief. Negotiations on which post the UK will be assigned will begin in Brussels on Wednesday, just days after Mr Cameron’s Cabinet reshuffle.","Pensions Secretary insists he is not going anywhere in the shake-up .

"By . James Chapman . David Cameron is set to pack the House of Lords with more cronies and failed politicians despite warnings the number of peers is set to top 1,000. Constitutional experts have warned that handing dozens of political allies and donors is ‘unsustainable’, but Government sources said another list of appointments to the bloated second chamber is due within the next fortnight. Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband will also get the chance to send more peers to the Lords despite criticism of places in the legislature for donors who have handed over millions of pounds in donations. Packed full of peers: David Cameron is set to pack the House of Lords with more cronies and failed politicians despite warnings that the number of peers with the right to sit in the chamber is set to top 1,000 . The list of around 20 new peers is expected to contain at least one Conservative Party donor and around three Labour nominees. Former energy minister Greg Barker, an old ally of the Prime Minister, is among those tipped to enter the Lords – though not until the time of the next general election. Mr Barker, one of the first MPs to back Mr Cameron for the Tory leadership and a dogged campaigner against climate change, surprised colleagues by giving up his job voluntarily in last week’s Government reshuffle and announcing he is to stand down as an MP in nine months’ time. David Willetts, the former universities and science minister, is thought to be another leading candidate to be handed a peerage when he too steps down at the next election. Mr Cameron is also said to have been lining up long-serving Tory home affairs adviser Patrick Rock to enter the Lords before he resigned after being arrested over alleged child porn offences. Mr Rock has now been charged. All three parties have called for a smaller upper house, given that it is now larger than the entire European Parliament. In the world, only China has a larger legislative chamber in the form of the National People’s Congress. Last summer, the three main parties appointed 30 more peers to the Lords, taking its membership to 836 – 200 more than the House of Commons. The extra peers are costing taxpayers an estimated further £1.2 million a year. Tipped: Former universities and science minister David Willetts, left, and Greg Barker, right, former minister for energy and climate change, are expected to be handed peerages when they step down as MPs at the election . Peers themselves complain the chamber is intolerably overcrowded, with members competing for seats in the chamber and office space outside. They complain of a fractious atmosphere and warn that a rapid influx of new peers – particularly former MPs – has had a negative impact on the Lords' traditionally non-partisan ethos and courteous atmosphere. However, Government sources say the Prime Minister will unveil a further list of appointments as part of a coalition deal to drastically alter the make-up of the upper chamber. Tories and the Lib Dems said on coming to power in 2010 that the chamber was unfairly dominated by hundreds of Labour peers. None can be removed unless they die, so the Government says it needs to appoint scores of its own to shift the balance of power and help ensure the fair passage of legislation through Parliament. The last effort to reform the Lords, which would eventually have seen 80 per cent of peers elected and the numbers cut to 450, foundered in 2012 after a rebellion by backbench Conservatives and the refusal of Labour MPs to cooperate. Government sources they will not take lectures from Labour, which they say stuffed the Lords with ‘duds and retreads’ during its 13 years in power. Lib Dem leader Mr Clegg has continued to make appointments to the Lords despite arguing the entire chamber should be abolished and replaced with an elected House. Senior Tories concede that their party’s backbench rebellion against proposals to introduce a few dozen elected peers as a first step towards reform looks more and more foolish, since it prompted the Lib Dems to block separate reforms to Commons constituency boundaries and cut the number of MPs by 50 in 2015. That means the Tories will fight next year’s election on boundaries heavily biased against them, meaning they need a poll lead of seven or eight points to be confident of a Commons majority.","More appointments to the Lords are due within the next fortnight .

"By . James Chapman . and Jason Groves . Michael Howard, 73, has been named as a candidate to be Britain's next EU Commissioner . Michael Howard was named yesterday as a candidate to be Britain’s next EU Commissioner. The former Tory leader, 73, is understood not to have been ruled out as David Cameron prepares to name his choice for the job following months of speculation. Both the Tories and the Liberal Democrats are also tipped to conduct a mini ministerial reshuffle, possibly on Monday. But the Brussels appointment has dominated Mr Cameron’s thinking and yesterday’s Spectator magazine listed Lord Howard, a former Home Secretary, as one of those in the frame. A Government source confirmed he was being considered, but insisted: ‘It remains highly unlikely. His name has clearly been around. The final decision hasn’t been taken.’ Several others touted for the role – including Foreign Secretary William Hague and Defence Secretary Philip Hammond – are said to be out of the running. However in the Cabinet, Leader of the Commons Andrew Lansley and Environment Secretary Owen Paterson are among those still tipped in an announcement likely to come next week. Business and energy minister Michael Fallon, highly regarded by No 10 as being reliable in a crisis, is also the subject of intense speculation. Former Cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell has not been ruled out – though ongoing legal cases surrounding the so-called ‘Plebgate’ affair, which saw him accused of swearing in the presence of police officers at Downing Street, may make his appointment difficult. EU diplomats insist that whoever is selected, Britain may come away empty-handed when EU leaders carve up a package of top EU jobs next week, due to its fierce opposition to Jean-Claude Juncker’s appointment as European Commission president. Foreign Secretary William Hague (left) and Defence Secretary Philip Hammond (right) are among those who are said to be out of the running for the job, which will be announced in the near future . Mr Cameron infuriated other leaders last month by breaking with a tradition of taking decisions by consensus and forcing them to vote on whether Mr Juncker should head the EU executive. Only Britain and Hungary voted no. Yesterday it also emerged that Nick Clegg is considering a plan to catapult his youngest female MP into the Cabinet, in a bid to tackle the Liberal Democrats’ image as a party of the ‘pale, male and stale’. Lib Dem sources claim that Jo Swinson, 34, could be fast-tracked into the Cabinet as early as this month to replace Energy Secretary Ed Davey. An alternative plan is also being considered that would see her appointed as Scottish Secretary following the independence referendum in  September, as part of a wider pre-election reshuffle. Mr Clegg is desperate to be seen doing more to make his top team look more inclusive, following a string of sex scandals – including claims that former party chief executive Lord Rennard made inappropriate advances towards female activists. David Cameron is preparing to name his choice for the job following months of speculation . But his 57-strong group of MPs contains just seven women and no-one from an ethnic minority, limiting his options. One Lib Dem said the lack of diversity was ‘embarrassing’, adding: ‘We used to call the Tories pale, male and stale, but look at us.’ Miss Swinson, minister for consumer affairs, only recently returned from maternity leave after having her first child before Christmas. But Mr Clegg believes she is ready for a front-line role in the run-up to the election. Meanwhile, there were signs last night that Tory Right-wingers are circling the wagons to protect their own in Mr Cameron’s reshuffle. Former Tory Chancellor Lord Lawson urged Mr Cameron not to bow to pressure from green groups to sack the Environment Secretary Owen Paterson, a leading Eurosceptic.","Michael Howard named as candidate to be Britain's next EU commissioner .

"By . James Chapman . The Liberal Democrats are on course to lose a swathe of seats to their Conservative coalition partners at next year’s general election, according to a major new series of polls. A study across 17 crucial Tory-Lib Dem marginal constituencies found that the Lib Dem vote has collapsed so significantly that as many as 15 of the party’s MPs are set to lose to Tory challengers. The Lib Dems are braced to lose more seats to Labour in the north of the country, where their vote has also slumped since 2010. The findings will pile pressure on Nick Clegg, who has attempted to reassure MPs and activists that despite a grim national picture, the Lib Dems are holding up in those seats where they are incumbent, particularly where the Conservatives are the main opposition. The Lib Dem vote has collapsed so significantly that as many as 15 of the party¿s MPs are set to lose to Tory challengers, a new poll has shown . They will also embolden senior Tories who want to kick the Lib Dems while they are down. Lib Dem MPs on the left of the party claim they have been approached by members of the 1922 committee of Conservative backbenchers seeking allies for a plot to try to break up the coalition. Senior Conservatives on the committee, said to be planning to stage a vote on whether the coalition parties should go their separate ways, apparently believe the move would be more credible if it was backed by some Lib Dems too. Research by pollster Lord Ashcroft, a former Conservative deputy chairman, provided the first comprehensive picture of how the two coalition parties are faring in the marginal seats where they chiefly compete against each other. Research by pollster Lord Ashcroft, pictured, provided the first comprehensive impression of how the two parties are faring in marginal seats . The study across 17 Tory-Lib Dem marginal seats found that the vote share for David Cameron’s party was down eight points since 2010 to 33 per cent, but the Lib Dems were down 15 per cent to 28 per cent. The polls found an overall 3.5 per cent swing from the Lib Dems to their coalition partners in the seats since 2010, enough for the Conservatives to unseat as many as 15 Lib Dem MPs if this were to happen across the board at the general election next May. However, there were signs of big regional variations. Swings ranged from one per cent Lib Dem to the Conservatives in Newton Abbot in Devon to 4.5 per cent from Conservatives to Lib Dems in Sutton and Cheam in south London. Lord Ashcroft noted that the Lib Dems are ‘famously tenacious local campaigners’ whose activists have a record of ‘incessant leaflet mongering’. He said the polling ‘suggests that in some places Nick Clegg’s party may indeed defy the national trend’ but ‘according to this snapshot the party risks losing a dozen or more seats to the Conservatives’. Across the 17 seats, six of which are held by the Conservatives and 11 by Mr Clegg’s party, the poll put the Tories on 33% (-8), Lib Dems on 28% (-15), Ukip 18% (+14) and Labour on 14% (+5). The Tories would hold their six marginal seats included in the survey - Camborne and Redruth, Harrogate and Knaresborough, Newton Abbot, Oxford West and Abingdon, Truro and Falmouth, and Watford. Among the 11 Lib Dem seats polled, seven would be won by the Tories: Solihull, Mid Dorset and North Poole, Wells, St Austell and Newquay, Somerton and Frome, St Ives, and Chippenham. MPs whose seats would be lost include Duncan Hames, Annette Brooke, Lorely Burt, David Heath, Andrew George, Stephen Gilbert and Tessa Munt. The Lib Dems would hold three - Sutton and Cheam, Cheadle, and Eastleigh - while the polling resulted in a dead heat in North Cornwall. Across the 17 seats Ukip’s vote share ranged from 11 per cent in Oxford West and Abingdon to 26 per cent in Camborne and Redruth, with just over one in six 2010 Conservative voters saying they would vote for Nigel Farage’s party. Business Secretary Vince Cable's closest ally, Lord Oakeshott, pictured, quit the Lib Dems after it emerged he had commissioned secret polling in Lib Dem seats to show the party would do better without Mr Clegg . Lord Ashcroft said: ‘Ukip are not just a problem for the Tories. Those who voted Lib Dem at the last election were as likely to say they would switch to Ukip (13%) as to say they would switch to Labour (13%). A further 11% said they intended to vote Conservative. ‘The party is literally losing votes right, left and centre. ‘The Lib Dems are in their current position not because of anything Nick Clegg himself has done or not done, but because his party is in government with the Conservatives - a decision endorsed by the whole party through its exhaustive processes of internal democracy. ‘The centre-right coalition already has a left-wing alternative, led by Ed Miliband. Former Lib Dem voters who switched because they were dismayed that the party entered office with the Tories would only consider coming back if the party promised not to make the same decision in 2015, no matter what the election result. ‘Such a declaration is surely unthinkable, or ought to be for a party that wants to have any influence on the nation’s affairs.’ Last month, Business Secretary Vince Cable’s closest ally, Lord Oakeshott, quit the Lib Dems after it emerged he had commissioned secret polling in Lib Dem seats to show the party would do better without Mr Clegg. The former Lib Dem Treasury spokesman, who leaked the poll findings in a botched coup attempt against Mr Clegg, said the Deputy Prime Minister had robbed the party of its ‘roots, principles and values’.","New study looked across 17 crucial Tory-Lib Dem marginal constituencies .

"By . James Chapman . Ed Miliband is facing mounting criticism from within his own top team for ‘wonkish’ policy announcements and a series of embarrassing gaffes. On the day he attempted to woo business with a plan to hand control of £30billion in development funds to the English regions, there was fresh sniping over his leadership. Labour peer Lord Glasman, a one-time policy guru for Mr Miliband, warned the party lacks ‘a sense of direction’ and urged his leader to ‘take a couple of novels rather than think-tank reports as his summer reading’. Ed Miliband will today use another speech to declare that his ‘central mission’ is to ‘rebuild faith in business and politics’ A shadow minister said there had been too many ‘wonkish’ economic announcements that would not connect with real people – such as the devolution of business rates and plans for a new infrastructure commission. ‘Voters just expect governments to do this stuff [on the economy] – they’re not interested in all the wiring of how it works,’ he said. Bemoaning a string of presentational blunders, the MP added: ‘We’ve got people being paid an awful lot of money to get these things right, and they’re not.’ Last weekend, it emerged Labour policy chief Jon Cruddas had been secretly recorded talking about bold ideas being stifled by the ‘dead hand’ of the leadership. And in the Commons, David Cameron seized on Mr Miliband’s ‘misleading’ claim that the Government’s jobs boom has chiefly benefited London. A briefing to journalists included the claim that four in five new jobs since 2010 have been created in the capital. This was repeated by Labour business spokesman Chuka Umunna and business policy architect Lord Adonis, who declared: ‘Four-fifths of net new jobs since 2010 have been in London.’ Labour peer Lord Glasman, a one-time policy guru for Mr Miliband, warned the party lacks ‘a sense of direction’ However, the statistic was taken from a report by the think-tank Centre for Cities using data from between 2010 and 2012. The latest official figures from the Office for National Statistics show just a quarter of new jobs were created in London since 2010, and just a fifth over the past year. Mr Miliband will today use another speech to declare that his ‘central mission’ is to ‘rebuild faith in business and politics’. The Labour leader will also insist Britain must not ‘drift toward exit’ from the EU and ‘cut ourselves off from the rest of the world’. Earlier this week former London mayor Ken Livingstone said Mr Miliband hated ‘trivial’ concerns about his image and would be a great reforming prime minister. His intervention follows that of former leader Lord Kinnock, and is the latest from a Left-wing veteran which may prove offputting to voters in Middle England. Lord Glasman has attempted to backtrack, revealing he said sorry to Mr Miliband for his article in Tuesday’s Financial Times. ‘I’ve apologised for that,’ he said. ‘I did get it wrong. My point is we need a genuine story . . . and I think that’s happening.’ Last night, in another indication of tensions, veteran Left-winger Dennis Skinner was voted off Labour’s ruling national executive committee in favour of former minister John Healey, a loyalist. MPs claimed there had been a campaign to oust Mr Skinner, who was said to have caused irritation by criticising the leadership.","Labour peer Lord Glasman warned the party lacks ‘a sense of direction’

"By . James Chapman . A senior Treasury adviser has claimed he was sacked after blowing the whistle when civil service bosses ‘killed off’ a flagship proposal by George Osborne. David Owen said an employment tribunal had ordered that he should be given his job back but Treasury bosses were refusing to comply. His case fuelled a row over the power of senior civil servants prompted by a leaked document suggesting they are being encouraged to resist the demands of ministers. A senior Treasury adviser has claimed he was sacked after blowing the whistle when civil service bosses 'killed off' a flagship proposal by George Osborne . They were accused of undermining democracy as an official document setting out the job description of permanent secretaries was revealed, suggesting civil servants could pick and choose when they backed their political bosses. Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude criticised the terms used for the recruitment of top Whitehall mandarins, claiming it ‘does not conform with constitutional propriety’. The document, written in 2009 but in use until last week, states that successful permanent secretaries - the most senior official in each department – must ‘balance’ the immediate needs and priorities of ministers with ‘the long-term aims of their department’. They act as ‘a “pivot point” in terms of knowing when to “serve” the political agenda and manage ministers’ expectations, versus leading their department with a strong sense of mission’, the document obtained by BBC2’s Newsnight said. Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude criticised the terms used for the recruitment of top Whitehall mandarins, claiming it 'does not conform with constitutional propriety' Former Conservative minister Nick Herbert said: ‘I think this is an extraordinary document. This is actually beyond a joke. ‘We can’t have a kind of permanent government of an unelected bureaucracy deciding that it has its own long-term priorities which may be different to those of ministers and elected government. ‘And I think this does go to some of the problems that we’re seeing of a civil service which is sometimes resistant to change.’ Mr Owen claims he was overruled by senior colleagues who amended a key piece of policy advice requested by ministers ahead of the 2011 budget. He insists he was adhering to the Chancellor’s wishes by including detail of a tax break for small businesses, which he says enjoyed Mr Osborne’s support, in his paperwork. But his advice was subsequently amended by senior colleagues who allegedly wanted to ‘kill off the policy wholesale’. Managers claimed that David Gauke, a junior Treasury minister, was ‘not keen’ on the proposal and planned to advice the Chancellor against it. Mr Owen said: ‘I flagged a concern. I was worried that some advice to ministers might not be objective – a breach of the civil service code. My managers suggested a review, but it never happened because, completely to my surprise, I was suddenly criticised on other grounds and sacked. ‘This seemed extraordinary: there was no complaint of incompetence, nor misconduct. 'So I resorted to an employment tribunal. Former Conservative minister Nick Herbert said the 'extraordinary document' was actually beyond a joke . 'It confirmed that I had worked well with past managers, that the reason given for dismissal was not the real one, and that I had been dismissed unfairly. It ordered I should be given my job back. ‘My department has refused. It has not appealed against the decision, but the permanent secretary has decided he disagrees with it. He’d rather the department incur whatever sanctions apply than take me back. ‘This is surely extraordinary. A rogue employer might set aside what the British justice system has ruled to be fair, but ought a government department do so? And have public resources, starting with the six-figure compensation payout, been properly spent? ‘I had an unblemished career in the civil service. I spoke out – politely, through the proper channels – and I’m now deprived of my career even though a judge has ordered I be reinstated.’","David Owen said employment tribunal .

"By . James Chapman . Ex-breakfast TV presenter and employment minister Esther McVey leads the charge . Two ministers dubbed the ‘yin and yang’ of Tory women are expected to be big winners in a wide-ranging reshuffle tomorrow. Feisty employment minister Esther McVey and ice-cool schools minister Elizabeth Truss head possibly a dozen women in line for promotion as David Cameron shakes up his team for the last time before next year’s election. Several long-serving male Cabinet ministers branded ‘the old lags’ will make way for new faces. The Prime Minister is determined to meet his target of one third of his ministers being female. The reshuffle comes as a major Parliamentary report out today warns Westminster is still so sexist and out of touch that women are being put off from entering politics. The all-party group for women in Parliament say radical steps are needed to make Westminster more female-friendly, given that only 22 per cent of MPs are women. Mr Cameron told the inquiry: ‘Parliament needs to be more representative of our country – so we need more women in Parliament.’ But shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper claimed the Prime Minister had a ‘real blind spot’ over women and his shake-up was ‘too little, too late’. Miss McVey may replace Ken Clarke as minister without portfolio and take a roving brief that would enable her to be one of the key Tory faces in next year’s election campaign. The Liverpudlian former GMTV presenter has been identified by strategists as one of the party’s most passionate and effective performers. Miss Truss, by contrast, has emerged as potential future leadership candidate through her attention to detail and unflappable manner. Parliamentary private secretary Penny Mordaunt and backbencher Priti Patel (right) are also tipped for the top . ‘Esther and Liz are the yin and yang of the up-and-coming women,’ said one senior Conservative. ‘With Esther it’s all passion and instinct. She is like an unguided missile – you never know quite where she is headed. Liz, on the other hand, projects poise and control. ‘She is still young but people make the Thatcher comparison, and not just because she’s an education minister. There is a touch of the Thatcher steel.’ Other women likely to be promoted include Treasury minister Nicky Morgan, a protegee of Chancellor George Osborne, backbencher Priti Patel and Parliamentary aide Penny Mordaunt. Margot James, Amber Rudd, Claire Perry, Harriett Baldwin and Nicola Blackwood are other women expected to advance. Former culture secretary Maria Miller, who resigned in a row over her expenses earlier this year, said Mr Cameron had a ‘hugely rich talent pool’ of female MPs. ‘People like Harriett Baldwin, who was a leader in her field in the City before she came to Parliament; Margot James – a very successful businesswoman,’ she said. The all-party report said the behaviour of some MPs in the House, particularly at Prime Minister’s Questions, was ‘raucous and ill-mannered’. Several women MPs ‘avoid Prime Minister’s Questions due to the testosterone-fuelled atmosphere in the chamber,’ the report added. It called for new powers for the Speaker of the Commons to be able to decline to call a badly-behaved MP for a named period. Miss Cooper told Sky News’s Murnaghan programme that Mr Cameron has had four years to promote more women into senior positions. ‘There’s only three women in the Cabinet of between 20 and 30 people at the moment and I think this is going to look really like a last minute worry about votes,’ she added. Senior sources also played down suggestions that Mr Cameron might opt at the 11th hour for a surprise woman candidate as Britain’s next EU commissioner. Nicky Morgan, Financial Secretary to the Treasury, and Elizabeth Truss could be on the way up . An announcement on who is to be nominated for the coveted post is expected this week, in tandem with the Cabinet reshuffle. The names of former policy chief Baroness Hogg, Treasury minister Andrea Leadsom and journalist Baroness Wheatcroft were linked to the role, following suggestions a woman might win a more influential portfolio as new EU boss Jean-Claude Juncker seeks to balance his team. He is said to want to create a new ‘commissioner for bureaucracy reduction’ – a post he might hand to the British nominee in a peacemaking gesture. Home Secretary Theresa May’s name was floated by some, but allies say she would tell Mr Cameron ‘to take a running jump’ if offered the position. There has been speculation that Mr Cameron might shift Education Secretary Michael Gove, following a series of public rows with colleagues and senior figures in education and poll numbers showing dismal levels of support for free schools. However, it is not clear where Mr Gove could go, with more senior jobs occupied by ministers not expected to move. Ministers heading for the exit door include chief whip Sir George Young, while Environment Secretary Owen Paterson, Welsh Secretary David Jones and leader of the Commons Andrew Lansley are all said to be vulnerable.","Former TV presenter and employment minster McVey leading promotion list .

"By . James Chapman . and Steve Doughty . Conservative MPs have stepped up a row with Britain’s leading aid charity over its ‘misleading’ assault on the Government’s austerity programme. Ministers are understood to share anger at Oxfam’s campaign accusing the Government of creating a ‘perfect storm’, including ‘benefit cuts’ and ‘unemployment’, which it suggested was fuelling hardship in Britain. Oxfam insisted it had a ‘duty’ to highlight hardship in the UK, but Tories branded its attack a ‘disgrace’ as official figures showed another record increase in the number of people in work. Ministers are furious at Oxfam's campaign accusing the Government of creating a 'perfect storm', which it suggested was fuelling hardship in Britain . They have lodged a complaint to the charities watchdog claiming the campaign breaches laws barring charities from political campaigning. Oxfam’s campaign involves a mock film poster showing a raging sea and black skies, carrying the slogan: ‘The perfect storm... starring zero hours contracts, high prices, benefits cuts, unemployment, childcare costs.’ Conservative MP Priti Patel, a member of the Number Ten policy advisory board, said: ‘Oxfam are behaving disgracefully by misleading the public about Government policies and their political campaigning may be in breach of their charitable remit. ‘They have shown their true colours and are now nothing more than a mouthpiece for left wing propaganda.’ Conservative MP Dominic Raab said: ‘It is sad, when a charity doing such great work abroad to alleviate poverty, becomes embroiled in politically partisan attacks in an attempt to compete with all the other head-in-the-sand left-wing groups and grab a few headlines” Political commentator Tim Montgomerie, former chief of staff to Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, said: ‘I won’t be giving to Oxfam again. I want to help the poorest people of the world, not finance left-wing politics.’ Charlie Elphicke, a Conservative MP, accused Oxfam of engaging in an overtly ‘political’ that was not borne out by the facts. Conservative MP Priti Patel, a member of the Number Ten policy advisory board, said Oxfam was 'behaving disgracefully' ‘My concern is that charities should walk the walk - helping make a difference to people at the front line - not talk the talk - engage in advertising or political campaigning. They should make a difference to people in their daily life,’ he said. ‘I think we can all see the messaging here and what Oxfam is intending to say. My bigger concern in many ways is that a lot of it is not accurate; we have got a government that is reforming zero-hours contracts, we have seen unemployment fall by 400,000, we have seen inequality - the gap between the rich and the poor - falling, we have seen relative poverty falling, and we have seen food poverty falling according to OECD figures.’ Tories also pointed to Oxfam’s links to the Labour Party, notably through its honorary treasurer David Pitt-Watson, who was appointed general secretary of the Labour Party in 2008, but did not take up the post. Mr Pitt-Watson was Labour’s finance director from 1997 to 1999. Jo Cox, a former head of policy at Oxfam, has been selected as a Labour candidate at the next election and is chair of the Labour women’s network. Ben Phillips, Oxfam’s campaigns and policy director, defended the advert, arguing the campaign was not political and that the charity has a duty to draw attention to the hardship ‘suffered by poor people we work with in the UK.’ ‘Fighting poverty should not be a party political issue,’ he added. The Charity Commission said it was considering a complaint about the campaign to determine whether a full-scale inquiry should be launched.","Ministers understood to share anger over Oxfam campaign .

"By . James Chapman . THE arch-federalist in line to win Europe’s top job last night made an extraordinary jibe at David Cameron, suggesting that the Prime Minister does not have the ‘common sense’ to back him. Jean-Claude Juncker declared that he was on course to become European Commission president at a summit this week, appearing to taunt Mr Cameron over his attempts to block him. ‘I am not designated commission president yet,’ Mr Juncker said. ‘If common sense prevails, this will happen at the end of the week – but it seems that common sense is very unequally distributed, so one will have to wait.’ Jean-Claude Juncker, the arch-federalist in line to win Europe's top job, last night made an extraordinary jibe at David Cameron, suggesting that the Prime Minister does not have the 'common sense' to back him . Mr Cameron insists he will fight ‘until the end’ against the appointment of Mr Juncker, the former Luxembourg prime minister, who Britain regards as an ultra-federalist and a roadblock to EU reform. Last night Mr Juncker pledged to offer the UK ‘a fair deal’ in Europe once he is installed in the top job, a decision expected to be confirmed in Brussels on Friday despite Mr Cameron’s objections. ‘Everything is indicating that the European Council can take a decision,’ Mr Juncker declared. The position is usually decided by consensus among the 28 EU national leaders, but it increasingly looks as though a vote may be called. Mr Cameron insists he will fight 'until the end' against the appointment of Mr Juncker, the former Luxembourg prime minister, who Britain regards as an ultra-federalist and a roadblock to EU reform . If this happens, it is possible Mr Cameron will lose by 26 to 2, with only Hungary on his side. As tensions deepened, Britain also threatened to veto a bid by Albania to join the EU unless there are new restrictions on how people can move across the continent. The poor Balkan country was granted candidate status for membership yesterday, but, opening up another rift with other leaders, Mr Cameron insisted he would not agree to it joining the EU unless freedom of movement rules are reformed.","Junckner said that 'common sense is very unequally distributed'

"By . James Chapman . Ed Miliband will announce that, if elected, he would sharply increase jobless handouts for those who lose their job after working for five years or more . Older jobless people would get higher unemployment benefits worth as much as £100 a week under new Labour proposals. But the benefit would be scrapped altogether for young adults from middle class families. Ed Miliband will announce today that if elected, he would sharply increase jobless handouts for those who lose their job after working and paying their taxes for five years or more. He will argue it is wrong that people who have been in work for just two years before they become jobless get the same rate - £71 a week - as someone who has been in work for five, ten or 30 years. So a Labour government plans to give an extra £20 or £30 a week more to those who have been in work for longer periods. The reform would be paid for by extending the period of time people have to be in work to become eligible for unemployment benefit – from two to perhaps five years. At the same time, Labour will end entitlement to adult out-of-work benefits for young people aged 18 to 21 and replace them with means-tested support for training. Those who already have the qualifications they need to secure decent jobs will be excluded. Around 100,000 young people claiming jobseeker’s allowance lack basic skills, but are prevented by benefit rules from training while looking for jobs, Labour says. Mr Miliband wants to make receipt of a new youth allowance – to be means-tested based on parental income – conditional on them entering a training course. The means test means 18- to 21-year-olds with parents earning above a fixed sum - likely to be around £42,000 a year in total household income - will be disqualified from help. Mr Miliband will also encourage local authorities to negotiate cheaper rents with landlords by using bulk contracts. And under proposals drawn up by the Institute for Public Policy Research think tank, councils would also be able to borrow against housing assets to boost local investment in affordable homes. They could set housing benefit levels in their local private rented sectors, would get control over central Government capital housing budget and would be able to set higher rent levels for richer tenants. Mr Miliband, speaking at the launch of a . report by IPPR in London, will say he wants to adopt ‘One Nation welfare . reforms’ which rewards those who had worked hardest or were  ready to . improve their skills without increasing government spending. Miliband will argue it is wrong people who have been in work for just two years before they become jobless get the same rate - £71 a week - as someone who has been in work for five, ten or 30 years (library image) ‘We face an economy where inequality is rising, year after year, and where so many people feel locked out of the chances that previous generations enjoyed. Turning that round is the mission of the next Labour government,’ the Labour leader will say. ‘And we must do so at a time when our country continues to confront a fiscal situation the like of which we have not seen for generations, the result of a financial crash the like of which none of us have ever seen. ‘So we can’t just hope to make do and mend and we can’t just borrow and spend money to paper over the cracks. ‘We must reshape our social security system so that it does everything it can to get people into decent jobs and the world of work not a life on benefits. ‘The perversity of the system means that the one thing we most discourage young people from doing is getting the skills they need for a decent career. The system is telling them that they should sign on for benefits not sign up for proper training but at the same time, it is saying to those who go to university that they are entitled to financial support. Conservative Party Chairman Grant Shapps, pictured, said Labour had opposed every single welfare reform introduced by the Government, including the new £26,000 welfare cap . ‘There can be no better example of a divided country which seems to value the 50 per cent of young people who go to university more than the untapped talents of the 50 per cent of young people who don’t. ‘Business won’t succeed unless we equip them with the skills they need to succeed. Young people won’t succeed unless with the skills they need to succeed. And Britain won’t succeed because it costs the taxpayer billions of pounds in extra welfare spending and lower productivity. We need to be One Nation, not two. He will say that, as a first step, Labour would introduce a higher rate of JSA to those who have contributed over years. This, he will say, would be funded by extending the length of time people need to have worked to qualify. Raising the point of eligibility from two to five years would pay for an increase in the level of contributory JSA by £20 to £30 a week, Labour officials said. This would mean older people who become unemployed and need to sustain their homes while they seek to return to work. ‘It is a principle deeply felt by the British people that people should get something back for all they have put in and not get something for nothing. That’s why people have such commitment to the idea of a proper basic state pension, so that there can be dignity for working people in retirement.’ Mr Miliband will add. ‘We will pay for it not by spending more money in social security system overall, but by extending the length of time people need to have worked to qualify.’ Conservative Party Chairman Grant Shapps said Labour had opposed every single welfare reform introduced by the Government, including the new £26,000 welfare cap. ‘This is just a recipe for more spending on welfare, more borrowing – and more taxes to pay for it. That’s exactly how Labour got us into a mess in the first place,’ he added. ‘Ed Miliband has no economic plan. All he offers is more of the same old Labour, and Britain would have a less secure future as a result.’","Older jobless to get benefits worth up to £100 a week in Labour proposals .

"By . Becky Barrow . and James Chapman . Millions of homeowners were last night warned to get ready for interest rate rises by the end of the year and the introduction of a cap on mortgage lending. Bank of England governor Mark Carney indicated that the first hike in rates for seven years is closer than expected – and is now likely to take place within months. And Chancellor George Osborne, announced the Bank is being given new powers to order a cap on the ratio of mortgage loans compared to borrowers’ incomes or to the value of their house. Announcement: The Bank of England will be given power over how much home-buyers can borrow. Its Governor Mark Carney, pictured, also indicated interest rates could rise within months . Speech: George Osborne announced new powers to cap mortgage loans in the Mansion House speech . Rate: The cap is believed to be between three and three-and-a-half the borrower's salary . The cap is widely expected to be between three and three-and-a-half times the borrower’s salary. As well as acting as an impediment to first-time buyers, the restrictions could affect many of those seeking to remortgage or move house. The interest rate rise is a further blow but Mr Carney tried to reassure anxious homeowners by making clear that interest rate rises will be ‘gradual and limited’ when they do begin. But he pointed out the base rate, frozen at an historic low of 0.5 per cent since March 2009, is expected by economists to rise to 2.25 per cent over the next three years. Mr Carney said: ‘There is already great speculation about the exact timing of the first rate hike. It could happen sooner than markets currently expect.’ Governor: The Bank of England chief tried to reassure homeowners saying increases will be 'gradual' Cost: The Chancellor, pictured, said house prices are still lower in real terms than they were in 2007 - and they were forecast to stay below that peak for some years to come . Pose: George Osborne with Lord Mayor of the City of London Fiona Woolf and Mark Carney. Of interest hikes, the Bank chief said: 'It could happen sooner than markets currently expect' The Treasury and the Bank are keen to . be seen to be alive to the potential risks of a housing bubble, though . Mr Osborne insisted last night there was no evidence that rising prices . yet posed any danger. ‘House . prices are still lower in real terms than they were in 2007 – and are . forecast to stay below that peak for some years to come,’ the Chancellor . said in his annual Mansion House speech. ‘So there is no immediate cause for alarm. Indeed the most recent data shows that mortgage approvals have actually slowed.’ However, Mr Osborne said ‘causes for concern’ were ‘on the horizon’, adding: ‘If London prices were to continue growing at these rates, that would be too fast for comfort. Financiers: Invited guests listen to the speakers during evening's dinner . Guests: Row after row of guests listen as speakers deliver their speeches . ‘Let me spell it out: Does the housing market pose an immediate threat to financial stability today? No, it doesn’t. Could it in the future? Yes, it could, especially if we don’t learn the lessons of the past.’ Mr Osborne dismissed accusations from Lib Dems that he is prepared to risk a housing bubble to fuel a feel-good factor and boost Tory chances at next year’s general election. ‘I’m not going to opt for the easy route of some of my recent predecessors: duck the issues, risk a housing boom, and keep my fingers crossed that it won’t damage the economy,’ he said. The only long-term solution to rising house prices, he said, was to build more homes. He set a target of 200,000 a year. He said councils would be forced to put in place pre-approved planning permissions on brownfield sites, saving developers time and money. The Chancellor also announced that the . Government would change the law to dramatically increase the Bank’s . powers over mortgage lending. ‘I want to make sure that the Bank of England has all the weapons it needs to guard against risks in the housing market. So today, I am giving the Bank new powers over mortgages, including over the size of mortgage loans as a share of family incomes or the value of the house,’ Mr Osborne said. ‘In other words, if the Bank of England thinks some borrowers are being offered excessive amounts of debt, they can limit the proportion of high loan to income mortgages each bank can lend, or even ban all new lending above a specific loan to income ratio. 'And if they really think a dangerous housing bubble is developing, they will be able to impose similar caps on loan to value ratios.’ Business Secretary Vince Cable said he was ‘appalled’ that banks were offering mortgages worth up to five times borrowers’ salaries – and indicated he believed a stable level was ‘three or three and a half times’. Such a limit would render homes unaffordable for most people in much of southern England. The Resolution Foundation think tank estimates that roughly 3.4million households with mortgages – around 38 per cent of the total have outstanding mortgages worth more than three times their net household income. Next week, senior executives at the Bank are due to meet to discuss potential action to control Britain’s booming housing market. Options include forcing borrowers to put down new minimum  deposits, such as 20 per cent, restricting loans which are more than four times a person’s salary and longer-life mortgages, such as 35-year loans.","Mark Carney hinted a hike in interest rates will take place within months .

"By . James Chapman . David Cameron has ordered the Tories not to publicly consider anything but outright victory, but privately a plan is being hatched to do a deal with Democratic Unionists . Senior Tories are secretly preparing the ground for a potential power-sharing deal with unionist MPs from Northern Ireland in the event of another hung parliament after next year’s general election. David Cameron and George Osborne have ordered ministers to say nothing in public to indicate they believe their party is contemplating anything other than outright victory. But privately, many fear the Conservatives are likely to struggle to assemble a majority, though they are increasingly confident that they can remain the largest party. If they again fall short of the 326 MPs needed for an outright win, senior Tories suggest the Democratic Unionist MPs from Northern Ireland could hold the balance of power. Currently, the party has eight MPs, making it the fourth largest party in Westminster. Mr Cameron will face a battle with sections of his party if he seeks to enter another coalition with the Liberal Democrats. He has promised MPs a formal say, and around 40 Tories are thought to be unlikely to back another deal with Nick Clegg under any circumstances. Senior Conservatives are now floating either a so-called ‘confidence and supply’ arrangement, which would mean guaranteeing support on votes of confidence in the Government and Budget measures, or a more formal power-sharing agreement with the DUP. One well-placed source said: ‘The DUP is definitely being wooed. Of course people are thinking about these things.’ A Tory Cabinet minister said a narrow overall victory next year was possible because voters were concluding Ed Miliband is ‘unelectable’, but a second coalition with the Lib Dems was still the most likely outcome. But behind the scenes there was ‘a lot of cosying up’ to the DUP and there was ‘much talk of them helping keep a minority Tory administration in business’, the minister said. Last month, in a sign of the efforts being made behind the scenes, the Prime Minister hosted a lavish reception in the Downing Street garden DUP MPs. The DUP is now said to be already drawing up its demands as the price of supporting the Conservatives in another hung Parliament after next year’s election – likely to include protection from some Government spending cuts. Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers has already signed an agreement with the Northern Irish Executive on an economic development package. It raises the prospect of Nigel Dodds, deputy leader of the DUP and MP for North Belfast, sitting in a Westminster government . Conservative MP Mel Stride, Parliamentary aide to John Hayes, senior Parliamentary adviser to the Prime Minister, said his party should ‘reach out now’ to the DUP. He pointed out that when a similar deal was mooted before the 2010 election, the DUP was said to be demanding a commitment to cancel £200 million of cuts to Northern Ireland’s public sector. ‘More sensible terms should follow from a better relationship with some issues scoped out in advance,’ Mr Stride said. ‘Coalition government has taught us the importance of developing and nurturing connections with other political parties.’ He pointed out that the DUP was the only other party that had backed a Conservative commitment to give voters a say on Britain’s membership of the EU. ‘Both Labour and the Lib Dems have explicitly ruled out a referendum on our membership of the EU. It could just be that an alliance with the other political party represented in Westminster that wants to protect our sovereignty will enable us to deliver on our commitment to renegotiate our relationship with the EU, deliver a historic referendum and govern again after May 2015,’ he added. Around 40 Conservative MPs are reportedly ready to block the idea of a second coalition with Nick Clegg's Lib Dems, if Mr Cameron again falls short of an overall majority . Paul Goodman, editor of the ConservativeHome website, said: ‘Were a 2010-style result to happen, two main options are canvassed – a second coalition, or a minority government.’ But he said there was a third – ‘a confidence and supply arrangement with Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionists’. ‘The province’s MPs have a history of importance in Parliaments in which the government of the day has a small majority, or none at all. Downing Street is certainly eyeing the DUP with interest,’ he added. The Ulster Unionists helped to prop up John Major’s government during the 1990s and Jim Callaghan’s in the 1970s. The prospect of a Tory-DUP deal came as it emerged allies of Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband have met to discuss common ground between Labour and the Lib Dems. The Labour peer Lord Adonis, and Lord Wood, one of Mr Miliband's closest advisers, met Jonny Oates, Mr Clegg's chief of staff and Neil Sherlock, a senior Lib Dem and donor, the BBC’s Newsnight programme reported. The group met for dinner at a London restaurant in April. There is increasing speculation at Westminster that Labour also fears it will fail to win a majority next year and is contemplating a coalition with the Lib Dems. Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable, said to want to be Chancellor in a Lib-Lab government, said yesterday such informal contacts between Lib Dems and Labour were ‘totally sensible’ but not preparations for future coalition.","EXCLUSIVE: Senior Tories examining plan to form a government with DUP .

"By . James Chapman . Another Star Wars movie is to be made in Britain in the latest sign that the force is with the burgeoning film industry. Chancellor George Osborne tonight announced that filming of the latest film - a keenly anticipated spin-off - will begin next year. The recently announced stand-alone Star Wars film will be directed by Gareth Edwards, with filming to take place at Pinewood Studios. A Star Wars spin-off, a scene from 1977 film A New Hope pictured, is to be made in Britain with filming starting at Pinewood Studios next year . The spin-off, a still from 1980's Episode V The Empire Strikes Back, pictured, will be directed by Gareth Edwards. The film-making industry has brought billions to the British economy in the past few years . The Chancellor sealed the deal with Culture Secretary Sajid Javid, on the set of Star Wars: Episode VII, where they met with Lucasfilm President, Kathleen Kennedy and that film’s director, J.J. Abrams. New reliefs have helped attract billions of pounds worth of filmmaking to Britain over the past few years. In the last year alone, over 300 films received tax incentives from the Government. They include films such as Skyfall, Burke & Hare, Hugo, Inception, War Horse, The Iron Lady, The Woman in Black and The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. The Government has offered similar reliefs for quality TV productions. Chancellor George Osborne met with Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy while filming Star Wars: Episode VII, one set in Abu Dahabi pictured, to confirm the deal . The Star Wars franchise was given a dramatic new release of life last year when creator George Lucas sold the rights to Disney in a $4.05billion deal to buy Lucasfilm. Multiple global locations were used between 1976 and 2003 for the production of the first six Star Wars films to provide the setting for alien planets, . Some of the early movies were shot at Ealing and Elstree Studios. The costumes of the stormtroopers, Darth Vader, and C-3PO were made by British craftspeople. The Chancellor said: 'Lucasfilm and Disney’s decision to shoot the Star Wars standalone movie in the UK is testament to the incredible talent in Britain. The filming will take place at Pinewood Studios, pictured. Previous filming for the films has taken place shot at Ealing and Elstree Studios . 'This will mean more jobs and more investment. It is great news for people working at Pinewood Studios, from the set designers to the carpenters. 'As Chancellor I have been determined that we back our brilliant creative industries which is why we have invested in skills and training as well as providing tax relief for films, high-end TV, animation, video games and regional theatre. 'The further changes the government made to the film tax relief at Budget 2014 will support our highly skilled, innovative creative sectors so that they continue to thrive and encourage more films to be made in the UK.' George Osborne sealed the deal with Culture Secretary Sajid Javid, on the set of Star Wars: Episode VII, cast pictured in London. The pair met with Lucasfilm President, Kathleen Kennedy and that film¿s director, J.J. Abrams (front left) Star of the original franchise Carrie Fisher appeared on The Paul O'Grady Show this week. She played Princess Leia in the popular sci-fi films . Kathleen Kennedy said: 'The UK crew that we’re working with on Star Wars: Episode VII is incredible. They’re among the most gifted and passionate when it comes to film and storytelling. 'Star Wars couldn’t be in better hands.' Mr Javid said: 'This is great news for the UK and is further proof of the world-leading position of the UK film industry. 'We have studios, tax incentives and talent, both in front of and behind the camera, which are amongst the very best in the world. Given Lucasfilm’s decision to film another Star Wars movie in the UK, it is clear that the Force is strong here.' Britain has long had connections to the Star Wars franchise - with Darth Vader's costume (pictured) along with those for the characters of C-3P0 and the stormtroopers made in the UK . By choosing the UK, films can benefit from the UK’s film tax relief, which gives 25 percent tax relief on the first £20million of qualifying expenditure, and 20 percent thereafter. Investment in UK-based film production in 2013 was over £1billion – an increase of 14 percent on the previous year. Film tax relief also helped to attract international filmmakers to the UK, with inward investment reaching over £868 million for 2013.","Star Wars spin-off to be made in Britain - with filming starting next year .

"By . James Chapman . Brussels has infuriated ministers with a provocative series of proposals to boost economic growth in Britain – including higher taxes, new levies on expensive homes, and more free childcare. The European Commission acknowledged the UK economy had roared back to life over the past year, but warned of ‘imbalances’ that required action from the Treasury. But Tories highlighted the 'irony' of the advice at a time when the British economy is storming ahead of the rest of Europe, and urged George Osborne to treat it as 'spam in his inbox'. Provocative series of proposals: The European Commission acknowledged the UK economy had roared back to life over the past year, but warned of 'imbalances' that required action from the Treasury . In an assessment of the state of the main EU economies, the Commission identified ‘risks in the housing sector’ as a problem for the UK and backed calls from other international organisations for the state’s Help to Buy scheme to be reined in. The intervention – after voters used . recent European Parliament elections to reject EU meddling – met with a . scathing response in Westminster. One Government source, pointing out UK growth had outstripped European rivals, said: ‘How do you spell irony?’ Dominic Raab, Conservative MP for Esher and Walton, said: 'Having helped bankrupt the Eurozone and delivered the biggest anti-EU election results in history, the Chancellor can be forgiven for treating the Commission's advice as spam when it arrives in his inbox.' Most controversially, the EC floated . the idea of new property and land levies to hit more expensive homes, . suggesting council tax is out of date because it is based on 1991 house . prices. On the public finances, the Commission . said the UK had ‘missed its headline deficit targets’ and called for a . ‘growth-friendly approach’ which prioritised spending on infrastructure . projects. 'The way forward': Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso (pictured) said member states 'must now play their part in seeing these reforms through, even if we know that sometimes they are politically unpopular' Suggesting taxes should go up across . the board, the EC said: ‘To assist with fiscal consolidation, . consideration should be given to raising revenues through broadening the . tax base.’ Angela Merkel has slapped down David Cameron’s efforts to block the election of a Euro fanatic to lead the EU. The German Chancellor (right) indicated she could force through the appointment of  federalist Jean-Claude Juncker. Her comments appear to scupper Mr Cameron’s bid to secure an alternative candidate to be President of the European Commission. Mr Juncker is a former prime minister of Luxembourg and long-standing enthusiast for a ‘United States of Europe’. Yesterday the PM insisted it would be wrong to appoint someone ‘no one has ever heard of’. But Mrs Merkel said: ‘I am working to ensure Jean-Claude Juncker gets the necessary majority in the Council. ‘I am also working to ensure that this decision, even if it is controversial – is made in the European spirit.’ Over the weekend it emerged Mr Cameron warned Mrs Merkel that her choice could lead to Britain’s early departure from the EU. Childcare costs, the Commission . warned, remain among the highest in the EU and should be addressed as . they pose problems for second earners and single parents. It also said the ‘predictability’ of the planning system needed to be increased to encourage development. The ‘non-binding’ recommendations will . be discussed at a Brussels summit later this month. Member states agree . collectively on what each government needs to do to consolidate and . build on signs of economic recovery. Commission President Jose Manuel .

We believe that member states must now play their part . in seeing these reforms through, even if we know that sometimes they are . politically unpopular.’ But Eurosceptic Conservative MP . Douglas Carswell said: ‘I’m afraid what this intervention demonstrates . is that it does not matter who you vote for, the European Commission and . high tax and spend policies win every time.’ Nick de Bois, secretary of the 1922 . committee of backbench Tories, said: ‘The EU economy and the eurozone . are in a desperate battle against high unemployment and a weakened . currency, so it’s bizarre that this unelected, unaccountable Commission . thinks it appropriate to lecture the UK government.’ Business Secretary Vince Cable, who . has also suggested the threshold for Help to Buy purchases should be . reduced from £600,000, will today meet housebuilders to discuss the . state of the property market. And a Bill to introduce ‘tax-free childcare’ will be included in tomorrow’s Queen’s Speech. The Coalition will confirm a commitment to help 1.9million families.","European Commission acknowledges UK economy has roared back to life .

"By . James Chapman . Iain Duncan Smith demanded new rights for Britain to restrict handouts to EU migrants in Berlin today . Iain Duncan Smith opened up a new front in the Tory battle with Brussels last night, demanding new rights for Britain to restrict welfare handouts for EU migrants. The Work and Pensions Secretary made a provocative speech in Berlin in which he hit out at the European Commission for telling us ‘we will have to pay benefits to anyone who comes here from Europe, regardless of their circumstances’, and that doing otherwise is ‘akin to xenophobia’. He said the Government had already banned new migrants from claiming housing benefit and stopped them from getting unemployment or family support until they have been living in the UK for at least three months. Migrants without work are also now required to prove they can speak English and that they will be able to get a job in order to claim. But Mr Duncan Smith said Britain wanted to go further, and demanded ‘the right to say to migrants that we require a much longer record of commitment before you get benefits and shortening the duration of any benefit claim that is allowed’. He condemned EU interference in the UK welfare system as ‘unwarranted and unwanted’ and said it should abandon its efforts to hold up a series of further welfare reforms he would like to make with a ‘constant stream’ of legal challenges. Meanwhile Brussels officials came under attack from senior Tories – even europhile Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg – for ‘lecturing’ Britain on its economic policy, despite growth here far outpacing that of struggling eurozone countries. London Mayor Boris Johnson said the European Commission could ‘take a running jump’ over one proposal for the UK to impose higher property taxes on owners of expensive homes. Mr Clegg said Brussels should concentrate on cutting red tape and regulation for businesses, rather than delivering ‘lectures’ to the UK. Mr Duncan Smith insisted Britain ‘strongly believes that the European Union must change’. Mr Clegg said Brussels should concentrate on cutting red tape and regulation for businesses, rather than delivering ¿lectures¿ to the UK today . He said the Government wanted to end the . ‘absurdity of paying family benefits to workers who have moved country, . yet whose children remain back at home, at a rate that bears little . relation to the level of benefits in the country where the children . actually live’. And he complained that the  EU ‘wrongly cites the freedom of movement as a justification for interfering with our national welfare system,  telling us we will have to pay benefits to anyone who comes here from Europe, regardless of their circumstances… and that to do otherwise is ... akin to “xenophobia”. He added: ‘If we fail to change ...  then we run the risk of damaging the reputation of free movement altogether.’ German Chancellor Angela Merkel reportedly asked the French government if it would put forward Christine Lagarde – who is currently head of the IMF – to be the next president of the European Commission. The appointment would be seen as a great victory for No 10 in its efforts to prevent so-called ‘Mr Euro’ Jean-Claude Juncker from getting the job. Britons pay higher property taxes than people living in any other developed country, according to new figures. Property taxes in the UK represent 4.2 per cent of the country’s total economic output, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development revealed. The average in the OECD is 1.8 per cent. The revelation makes a mockery of European Commission calls for new property and land levies to hit more expensive homes in Britain. The TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘The housing market is already over-taxed. The answer is planning reform, not headline-grabbing wealth taxes.’","IDS hitting out at European Commission during speech in Berlin .

"By . James Chapman . The 'Good Samaritan law' was drawn up after the case Jordon Lyon, ten, who drowned in Wigan after rescuing his sister . Have-a-go-heroes are to be given special protection from prosecution or legal action under a radical ‘Good Samaritan law’ being drawn up by ministers. David Cameron wants to protect emergency workers and the public from legal consequences if they intervene in good faith to help someone in difficulty, the Daily Mail has learned. Similar legislation operates in Australia where it has reduced the potential for  negligence claims against doctors, police and firefighters, as well as ordinary members of the public. A form of the Good Samaritan law is expected to be a centrepiece of next week’s Queen’s Speech, which will set out the Coalition’s plans for the last year before the General Election. The purpose of the law is to prevent people from being reluctant to help a stranger in need for fear of legal repercussions should they make some mistake in a rescue attempt or treatment. ‘It’s about protecting people who act in a heroic fashion. That could include emergency workers, but really it is about anyone who is trying to do the right thing,’ said a well-placed source. The Prime Minister has said the fear of transgressing UK and EU rules sometimes means people ‘stand aside when others need help’. Ministers point to the case of ten-year-old Jordon Lyon in September 2007, who drowned in a pond in Wigan having rescued his young sister after community support officers were told not to intervene as they had not undertaken water rescue health and safety training. And in the inquests into the July 7 bombings in London, evidence emerged that a number of victims remained alive long after three bombs were detonated on the London Underground in 2005. Though it was concluded none could have been saved, the inquest heard some were left to die in pain because of health and safety protocols which left firemen unable to rush in to rescue them. Paramedics were also alleged to have been prevented from helping victims of Cumbria gunman Derrick Bird’s shooting spree in 2010 because health and safety policies meant police held back ambulance crews and rescue helicopters until every shooting scene was cleared. Lord Young, who was Margaret Thatcher’s trade secretary, drew up a report for the Government recommending health and safety law is reined in and Good Samaritans given reassurance in law. ‘If a fireman or a policeman commits an act of heroism in the course of his duty, he can be prosecuted for endangering himself,’ Lord Young told the Mail when his recommendations were published. ‘We all know stories of policemen standing by when people have got into trouble, and have been backed up by their superiors for not putting themselves in danger. It’s a corrosive thing. People believe they mustn’t do something they want to do.’ Ordinary citizens who are trying to help others in Good Samaritan situations must also be reassured that they cannot be sued, he said. ‘We have to make it completely clear to people, if you clear the snow in front of your house, if you stop to do anything to help somebody, you are not liable,’ Lord Young said. Jordon jumped into the pond, pictured above, after police community support officers were told not to intervene over fear of legal consequences - because they had not undertaken water rescue health and safety training . While most people are not so ungrateful to sue someone who tried to help them and administered first aid, increasing numbers of court cases have been brought against Good Samaritans. Specialist insurance is available to healthcare workers to guard against civil claims brought against what is argued to be medical malpractice – incorrectly administering a procedure, or negligence – in situations where they were doing their best to help. As well as Australia, many other countries protect emergency workers and members of the public from being pursued in the courts when they have tried to assist someone in good faith. In France, there is a specific obligation on citizens to help others in distress, and they risk prosecution if they do not. While in Canada, any rescuer who has voluntarily helped a victim in distress is legally protected from being successfully sued  for ‘wrongdoing’.","David Cameron's 'Good Samaritan law' due to feature in Queen's Speech .

"By . James Chapman . Change: Nick Clegg is on the verge of matching Cameron's pledge to hold an in/out vote on Britain's EU membership . Nick Clegg is on the brink of matching David Cameron’s pledge to hold an in/out referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU, senior Liberal Democrats say. The Deputy Prime Minister is understood to be considering a dramatic shift in his party’s position following the Lib Dem wipeout in last month’s European elections. The move would leave Labour dangerously exposed as the only major party opposing a referendum. Senior figures from both the right and left of the Lib Dems, including at least three ministers, are telling the Deputy Prime Minister his position is untenable, the Daily Mail has learned. Thus far, Mr Clegg has refused to back Mr Cameron’s pledge to hold a referendum on Britain's future in Europe by the end of 2017 if he remains in Downing Street, whether or not he succeeds in negotiating substantial changes in our relationship with Brussels. The Lib Dems were branded ‘enemies of democracy’ by Tory colleagues after conspiring with Labour to kill off legislation guaranteeing plans to hold an in/out referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU earlier this year. The Deputy Prime Minister has claimed that the Prime Minister’s promise is against the national interest and risks derailing the economy by creating uncertainty for international investors. He has also dismissed the chances of Britain achieving any meaningful return of powers from Brussels. But the Prime Minister has insisted that a referendum is a ‘deal breaker’ in any future coalition negotiations – saying it cannot be ditched if he fails to win an outright majority and seeks a new power-sharing deal with the Lib Dems. It is increasingly clear that despite his public opposition, the Deputy Prime Minister does not regard blocking a referendum as a priority if his party does enter into a second coalition with the Conservatives. Senior Lib Dems believe embracing a referendum will show that the party, which was beaten into a humiliating fifth place behind the Greens in last month’s European elections, has listened to voters. A source close to Mr Clegg said: ‘We are not indifferent to the message the electorate have just sent us. We will make clear our position on the referendum Bill in due course.’ One option would be to commit to a referendum in the next Parliament but not to the timetable set out by Mr Cameron. Tim Farron, the Lib Dem president, said: ‘I think the British people should be given a say on whether we should be in or out of the EU but David Cameron’s policy is like playing poker with all your cards showing.’ Demands: The Prime Minister has insisted that a referendum is a 'deal breaker' in any future coalition negotiations - and that he would not continue as PM unless a vote by 2017 could be guaranteed . One Liberal Democrat minister said: ‘It is obvious we would agree to hold the Tories’ blessed referendum if we go into a second coalition. So why don’t we get share of the credit for offering one? ‘We called ourselves “the party of in” in the European elections, and we should accept that voters are going to have a say and make the positive case for remaining in the EU.’ Another senior Lib Dem said a shift in position, agreeing to a referendum, would pile pressure on Labour, which has effectively ruled out holding a vote. ‘It would put them in an impossible position,’ the source said. The issue will come to a head within weeks as the Tories reintroduce a Bill committing the Government to holding a vote by 2017 and dare the other parties to frustrate it once again. Mr Cameron insists the vast majority of voters want a say on the issue and has condemned the Lib Dems for refusing to allow Government legislation to proceed. Instead, the Conservatives will back backbench legislation to be introduced by former minister Bob Neill. They did the same in the last Parliamentary session, succeeding in getting a Bill through the Commons but seeing it killed off by Labour, Lib Dem and crossbench peers in the Lords. In a highly unusual move for backbench legislation, a three-line whip – the strongest possible instruction – is to be imposed on Tory MPs, meaning any members of the Government who voted against would have had to resign. Mr Neill, now vice chairman of the Conservative Party, said: ‘One of the first votes I ever cast was on EU membership in the 1970s . Now as I pick up my bus pass I am getting the chance to work with colleagues to secure a referendum for the British people. ‘Britain needs a new deal with Europe and the Conservatives have a plan for change in Europe – renegotiate, reform and put the deal to the British people in an in/out referendum by the end of 2017. ‘Parliament now has the chance to pass my backbench bill and guarantee that the British people have the final say.’","Clegg on the brink of matching Cameron's pledge to hold in-out referendum .

"By . James Chapman . and Jason Groves . Labour was in turmoil last night as senior MPs rounded on Ed Miliband for failing to anticipate the dangers of a Ukip surge. As town hall election results left Labour MPs depressed about their chances of regaining power, Mr Miliband was accused of running a ‘tremendously ill-judged campaign’ marred by gaffes. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said the results were ‘not good enough’. In what was widely seen a dry run for the general election campaign next year, Labour’s vote share was 31 per cent, just two points ahead of the Tories and seven points lower than it managed a year before Neil Kinnock lost the 1992 election. Labour was in turmoil last night as senior MPs rounded on Ed Miliband for failing to anticipate the dangers of a Ukip surge . Pressure on Mr Miliband and the ‘metropolitan elite’ at the top of his party will increase if, as strategists fear, it is beaten by Ukip in European Parliament elections, results of which are due tomorrow. Although Labour made progress in London, it lost huge chunks of its vote to Ukip in northern strongholds such as Rotherham, Sunderland and Grimsby, and failed to win key Middle England swing councils in Tamworth, Thurrock and Swindon. Its gains of nearly 300 fell well short of the 500 that experts said it needed to show it was on course for general election victory. In an ominous sign for Mr Miliband – who insisted he ran a ‘good’ campaign – senior members of the shadow Cabinet, including Mr Balls, Harriet Harman and Yvette Cooper, were said to have complained they felt ‘shut out’ of Labour’s campaign. One insider told the Labour-supporting New Statesman that the strategy to concentrate on Mr Miliband had failed disastrously. ‘It was all Ed, Ed, Ed,’ the source added. Mr Balls called for the party to strengthen its position on issues including immigration and Europe, a key driver of Ukip support. Pressure on Mr Miliband and the 'metropolitan elite' at the top of his party will increase if, as strategists fear, it is beaten by Ukip in European Parliament elections, results of which are due tomorrow . ‘Whether on Europe or immigration or on the economy, Labour has got more to do to show we can deliver the real fair change people want to see,’ he said. John Mann, MP for Bassetlaw, insisted poor results were the ‘fault of Ed Miliband and all the people at the top of the Labour Party’, who had complacently believed a Ukip advance would hit only the Tories. Arguing that Labour’s ‘metropolitan elite excluded ordinary people’, he added scornfully: ‘Some of the pointy-heads at the top of the party thought that Ukip doing well is what we needed.’ On a day that saw all three main parties hit by the Ukip advance: . Yesterday’s results suggested that as things stand, both Labour and the Conservatives will struggle to assemble a Commons majority next year. Ironically, experts said Ukip’s advance could help ensure the Lib Dems remain in government in another coalition. Professor John Curtice, of Strathclyde University, said: ‘Labour’s lead over Conservatives of two points is narrower than last year, and it is narrower than 2012. This is a clear warning to Labour.’ Ed Miliband admitted there was 'a deep sense of discontent' among voters . Ukip last night hailed a ‘tremendous result’ after winning ten council seats in the Labour stronghold of Rotherham. The dramatic result – which saw Ukip  become the biggest opposition group – is a huge blow to Labour in its South Yorkshire heartland, where Ed Miliband is MP for Doncaster North. It will be seized on by the party as evidence that they are as much of a threat to Labour in the North as they are to the Conservatives in South. Ukip councillor and Rotherham branch chairman Cavan Vines said: ‘This will send shockwaves. If you can break Rotherham, the rest will follow.’ Labour MPs . expressed despair at a series of media gaffes by Mr Miliband during the . campaign – including failing to know the price of groceries, forgetting . who was in control of a key council during a visit to the area and an . unfortunate photocall at which he struggled to eat a bacon sandwich. Mr Mann added: ‘Some of the so-called strategists at the top of the Labour party think Ukip doing well is good news because it will damage Cameron. 'Well, they need to get out of their ivory towers and get back into the real world. That was a fundamental error.’ John Healey, Labour’s respected former housing minister, warned Mr Miliband: ‘We need to be clearer, bolder and stronger about the plans we have.’ Labour grandee Tessa Jowell said the basic presentational errors of the campaign were unforgivable. ‘If you are a politician . . . don’t eat a bacon butty when the world’s cameras are on you.’ Graham Stringer, MP for Blackley and Broughton, said Mr Miliband ‘is behind in the personality stakes’ and the party was struggling on economic policy. He added that it was ‘unforgiveably unprofessional’ for the Labour leader not to know the value of his family’s weekly shopping bill when he was running a ‘cost of living’ campaign. Mr Miliband admitted there was ‘a deep sense of discontent’ among voters. ‘You also saw some people turning to Ukip and I am determined that over the next year we will persuade them that we can change their lives for the better.","Labour leader was accused of running a ‘tremendously ill-judged campaign’ marred by gaffes .

"By . James Chapman . Home Secretary Theresa May has emerged as the bookies favourite to succeed David Cameron after taking on the police . Theresa May has been installed as the favourite to succeed David Cameron as her extraordinary confrontation with police leaders was hailed as one of the bravest political speeches of recent decades. Conservative MPs expressed admiration for the Home Secretary’s declaration at the Police Federation conference that a string of scandals has left the legitimacy of British policing under threat. Britain’s former ambassador to the US, Sir Christopher Meyer, told the BBC Daily Politics programme that Mrs May had ‘echoes of Margaret Thatcher’ and had delivered ‘one of the most powerful, courageous and candid speeches by a Cabinet minister I have ever seen’. One senior Conservative woman said: ‘Theresa was already a contender to succeed David Cameron but some of my more boorish male colleagues haven’t taken the idea entirely seriously. That will now change.’ William Hill promptly slashed the odds on Mrs May succeeding Mr Cameron as the next leader of the Tory party, making her 4/1 favourite ahead of the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, the 5/1 second favourite and Michael Gove at 8/1. 'Mrs May's speech to the Police Federation seems to have done her leadership prospects no harm at all,’ said the bookmaker’s Graham Sharpe. Making her annual appearance at the federation’s conference in Bournemouth, the Home Secretary left officers at the conference in stunned silence as she used the speech to upbraid them for often displaying ‘contempt for the public’, and reel off allegations of corruption cases including the Stephen Lawrence and Daniel Morgan murders. She said the federation, which represents 126,000 rank and file officers, and had faced accusations of bullying and a lack of transparency in its accounts, now had to change from ‘from top to bottom’. Officers would no longer automatically become members of the federation, instead having to opt in, the Home Secretary added. He announcement that she was cutting off public funds for the federation was seen as the most aggressive act by central government towards police rank and file since the defeat of the police strike in 1918, nearly a century ago. Public money previously spent on the federation will instead go towards a new scheme called Police First, aimed at attracting university graduates into the force. Former Labour activist Dan Hodges claimed Mrs May had given ‘one of the most incredible speeches delivered by a British politician in peacetime’. He said he struggled to think of a time when a politician had ‘laid it on the line like that’, comparing it to Neil Kinnock’s infamous confrontation of Labour’s Militant wing in 1985. ‘She began in conciliatory tone, remembering fallen officers, and delivering a tribute to the understated bravery of their colleagues and then, without missing a beat, she tore the police service apart,’ he said. ‘Slowly and methodically the Home Secretary read out the charge sheet. Finally a senior politician has told the Police Federation what it needed to hear. 'Whatever issues David Cameron’s party have with the police, they are still the putative party of law and order. 'It was the equivalent of [ex-Labour minister] Andy Burnham turning up to the Royal College of Nursing when he was Health Secretary and telling their delegates, ""Forget all that stuff about you all being angels. Patients have been dying of thirst on your watch, and it has to stop"".’ Mrs May used a devastating speech to the Police Federation to exert her authority over officers . Tory leadership rival Boris Johnson yesterday spent the day on the campaign trail with Mr Cameron in Newark . Ed Owen, former adviser to Labour Home Secretary Jack Straw said: ‘It is the sort of speech I wish in retrospect my former boss had been able to make. He should have done.’ Will Riches, who is hoping to become the Police Federation’s chairman, said he was at a loss to understand the tone of the Home Secretary's address. He said delegates had arrived at the auditorium prepared to agree to reform but were left in ‘anger and bewilderment’. But Sir Peter Fahy, chief constable of Greater Manchester police and vice-president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘I have to agree with a lot of what the home secretary said. A lot of the various scandals have damaged the image of policing. The federation needs to get on with the change agreed yesterday.’ The steely Home Secretary, hailed as 'Britain's Angela Merkel' by her allies, would not countenance any sort of leadership challenge to David Cameron, and has repeatedly stressed her loyalty to him. However, she is understood to regard Boris Johnson as 'faintly ridiculous' and is determined to prevent him becoming leader in the event of the Tories losing the next election.","Tory minister used extraordinary speech to attack police over scandals .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The teenage girl who fell 3,500 feet in a skydiving accident has revealed that she only remembers screaming and then blacking out when she realized that there was a problem with her parachute. Makenzie Wethington, whose injuries included damage to her liver and a kidney, some bleeding in her brain, and a broken pelvis, lumbar spine, shoulder blade and several ribs, spent a about a week in an Oklahoma City hospital before transferring to one in her home state of Texas. 'I remember jumping out of the plane and looking up and seeing that there was a complication with the parachute and so I started kicking my feet like I was taught in the class and I looked up and it still wasn't fixing so I tried to pull the toggles apart,' said Makenzie, who is from the small town of Joshua, said at a news conference at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas. Scroll down for video . Survivor: Makenzie Wethington said that she blacked out and does not remember anything that happened in the three days after her skydiving accident . Optimistic: Doctors expect the 16-year-old to make a full recovery in spite of the fact that she fell more than 3,500 feet on a parachuting trip just over two weeks ago . 'I just was not strong enough to fight off the wind. I just remember screaming and then I blacked out and I don't remember anything after that, for three days after.' 'I know I was scared and I know that there was something very wrong. I think I was focused on how I could fix it and what I could do,' she said, adding, 'I think I went into shock.' The accident happened on January 25 and doctors already have said that they expect Makenzie  to make a full recovery. Dr Seema Sikka, who is treating Wethington at Baylor Institute for Rehabilitation, noted that the 16-year-old is already walking 'a good amount' with a walker and is regularly in a wheelchair while wearing a neckbrace. Miracle recovery: Makenzie, seen here taking her first steps a week after the accident, is now progressing and has been able to walk 'a good amount' with the aide of a walker . Incredible: Miraculously, the Joshua, Texas, teen, pictured, survived the horror fall, baffling doctors at the Oklahoma University Medical Center where she was first treated before being transferred to her home state of Texas . Dr Sikka said she may be released from the hospital in about a week. After that she'll continue to need various outpatient therapies. 'I'm good. I feel good. I'm doing better every day,' Makenzie said. 'I'm very thankful that I can move as well as I can. Her parents agreed to allow her to skydive as a 16th birthday present, and her father jumped ahead of her. Makenzie said she had wanted to go skydiving for years and had convinced her parents to let her do it after learning someone could skydive at the age of 16 in Oklahoma with parental consent. The owner of the skydiving school has said the parachute opened, but Wethington began to spiral downward when the chute went up but not out in some kind of malfunction. Sticking together: Makenzie begged her parents to allow her to go skydiving for her 16th birthday and as part of the deal her father Joe jumped with her, but his parachute did not malfunction . Positive outcome: Makenzie, seen with her mother Holly at the Thursday press conference, said that the incident has made her want to become a trauma surgeon . The owner maintains that Makenzie and other divers were given instruction beforehand on how to deal with such problems. She said she wasn't scared as she jumped. 'I remember getting in the plane and feeling that rush of excitement,' she said. Her father, Joe Wethington, said that when he ran up to her where she'd fallen in a cow pasture, the teenager couldn't catch her breath and had a frightened look on her face. 'Every time she would catch a breath she would just scream and ask me to rub her back,' he said. Makenzie said she's always wanted to be a surgeon, but her experience after being injured has made her want to focus on being a trauma surgeon. When asked if she ever wanted to skydive again, she replied: 'As much as I would like to, I think that my parents and the rest of my family would die if I did. They're against that now.'","Makenzie Wethington is expected to make a full recovery after a skydiving accident broke her lumbar spine, pelvis, ribs and shoulder blade all broken .

"By . James Chapman . Business Secretary Vince Cable tonight attacked the 'utterly reprehensible' behaviour of his close friend Lord Oakeshot - after it emerged he had paid for a poll that showed Nick Clegg was doomed to election defeat. Mr Cable said his friend's bid to topple the Deputy Prime Minister in the wake of the party's European and local elections disaster was 'totally inexcusable'. The Lib Dem Cabinet Minister's decision to name Lord Oakeshott as the source of the damning research came as Mr Clegg was left pleading with his party not to sack him.Mr Cable tonight insisted there was 'no leadership issue' as far as he was concerned. Scroll down for video . Vince Cable moved to distance himself from his friend Lord Oakeshott tonight after confirming that he was behind a damaging poll on the Deputy PM's leadership . Lord Matthew Oakeshott (pictured) is a close friend of Business Secretary Vince Cable. The pair go on holidays together, but Mr Cable . insisted the Lib Dem peer was not his spokesman . Nick Clegg faced growing criticism over his leadership today following last week's disastrous showing at the European and local elections . The dramatic development came after pollsters ICM released the new survey revealing that Mr Clegg could lose his own seat at the general election. It showed that if an election was held now, Mr Clegg would finish third in his constituency - behind Labour and the Tories. More than half of Mr Clegg's constituents thought he was doing a bad or 'very bad' job as Deputy Prime Minister - while around 45% said he was a bad local MP. Meanwhile, almost one in three voters in Sheffield Hallam did not even know Mr Clegg was their MP, the poll found. The poll sparked fury among Mr Clegg's allies who suspected Lord Oakeshott had commissioned the study to topple the Deputy Prime Minister and replace him with Mr Cable. But the Business Secretary released a statement tonight denying that Lord Oakeshott spoke for him. He said: 'Lord Oakeshott's actions are totally inexcusable and unacceptable. I have made it very clear repeatedly that he does not speak or act for me. 'Commissioning and publishing polls without the consent of the Member of Parliament, as in the case of Sheffield Hallam, is utterly reprehensible. 'There are undoubtedly raw feelings in the wake of poor local and European election results. We need to respond in a measured way. 'Public speculation about the leadership is an unwelcome distraction and as I made absolutely clear yesterday there is no leadership issue as far as I'm concerned.' The Deputy Prime Minister appeared more relaxed and happy than yesterday as he played pool with 16 and 17-year-olds at a training centre at St Andrew's Youth Club, in central London this morning . Mr Cable's bombshell statement came after Mr Clegg pleaded with Lib Dem MPs not to 'lose their nerve' and get rid of . him. The . Deputy Prime Minister admitted he had lost the argument over Europe and . immigration with Nigel Farage, in the wake of last week's disastrous . European and local election results. But . the Lib Dem leader insisted he would not quit. He said he wanted to . 'finish the job' and dismissed calls to dissolve the coalition or shift . the party's approach to Europe. Asked . this morning if he was prepared to stand down, Mr Clegg said: 'Look, I . think if I felt or indeed if the whole party felt that changing . strategy, changing leaders, pulling out of the coalition, which is what a . number of these individuals advocate, would deal with the challenge . which the party faces, because of course we face challenges - that's . obviously daft to suggest otherwise - then I wouldn't hesitate to . advocate it. 'But . I think it's so important that particularly at a time when our big . judgments as a party over the last few years, difficult years they've . been politically, are now being vindicated in terms of delivering the . economic recovery that we came to this Government to deliver, delivering . all the things that we've been campaigning on for years. 'I . think that's not the time to start turning inwards when we of course as . a party, as a campaigning party should be talking to the British people . about what we want to do in the future.' Asked later what he would do to win back voters, Mr Clegg reaffirmed his commitment to the Coalition and said it was the 'wrong time to lose our nerve'. He said: 'I don't think pulling out of the Coalition is the answer. We said back in 2010 very, very clearly that we were making a five-year commitment. 'We knew it was going to be tough, not only tough of course entering into a coalition in the first place, but also doing the very downright difficult and controversial things that we needed to do to fix the economy. 'But I think a year out before a general election, exactly at the point, as I say, when those big judgments are proving their worth, would be the wrong time to lose our nerve.' He added: 'I think it's very important that we see that through because otherwise, of course, a lot of people will conclude that somehow the Liberal Democrats are only comfortable in opposition.' Mr Clegg was bombarded with questions from reporters when leaving his home in South London this morning . Asked if he had lost the argument on Europe, Mr Clegg said: 'I totally accept, of course, the verdict of voters last week that we did not win the case that I was putting and my party was putting.' But he added: 'The argument has now started and I hope and believe over time it will be won.' Mr Clegg received support from unlikely sources yesterday - as Tony Blair and David Cameron threw their weight behind him. This morning Downing Street made clear Mr Cameron wanted the Deputy PM to stay on. Meanwhile, former PM Tony Blair said he admired the 'leadership and courage' the Lib Dem leader had shown in power. The backing came with Mr Clegg under intense pressure after his party lost hundreds of councillors and 11 of its 12 MEPs. He has received public support from senior Lib Dem colleagues, but a number of MPs and activists have broken cover to warn he is 'toxic' for voters and must go. A spokeswoman for the Prime Minister was repeatedly asked about Mr Clegg's position at a briefing for journalists this morning. She said: 'This is a strong coalition that is pursuing its long term economic plan.' Pressed on whether that meant Mr Cameron wanted his deputy to remain in place, the spokeswoman replied: ""I think I have said that... 'I've been clear the PM is intent on working with the coalition, with the Deputy Prime Minister to secure the economic recovery and to keep improving the situation for Britain's hard-working families. 'He's focused on working with the Deputy Prime Minister as part of the coalition to deliver on the Government's plans.' Nigel Farage was congratulated during a meeting of the leaders of European Parliament political groups in Brussels today . Quizzed on whether Mr Cameron could work with anyone else if Mr Clegg was overthrown, the spokeswoman said: 'I have not seen anything from either the PM or Deputy PM to suggest that is happening, and they are very much focused on working together and continuing with the achievements that the coalition has made.' Mr Blair told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that he did not think the Lib Dems' decision to campaign in the European election as the 'party of in' had been their main problem. He said: 'To be fair to Nick Clegg - and I don't want to damage him by saying this - I think over the past few years he has shown quite a lot of leadership and courage. 'The problem they have is nothing to do with Europe. The problem they have is very simple. They fought the 2010 election on a platform significantly to the left of Labour and then ended up in a Conservative Government with a platform significantly to the right of Labour. There's not really a cure for that.'","Cable's friend Lord Oakeshott commissioned damning research on Clegg .

Daredevils Marshall Miller, Neil Amonson, Jesse Hall and Jt Holmes are the GoPro Bomb Squad. The group have travelled the world over the last five years, showcasing their talents in disciplines as diverse as paragliding, speed flying, wingsuit cloud surfing, base jumping, and skydiving.

'Scary': GoPro Bomb Squad member Marshall Miller leans out of an aeroplane at the X Games in Brazil . Adrenaline: The GoPro Bomb Squad dangle from the skids of a helicopter and soar above the Alps with only a wingsuit for protection . Their stunts have included dangling from the bottom of a helicopter thousands of feet in the air and base jumping from bridges. 'When you’re dangling from bottom of a helicopter, it’s a pretty amazing feeling, you feel like you shouldn’t be there. Usually the helicopter pilot doesn’t want you to do it but we assure them that it’s fine,' Marshall said. 'It’s actually really scary to climb down on to the skid, so we really like to take people for their first time and watch their face as they do it. If it was a jungle gym it would be really easy to do, but when you’re thousands of metres in the air, it’s a little unnerving!' The full-time thrill-seekers formed the Bomb Squad in 2008 after approaching portable action camera maker GoPro for sponsorship in the hope of turning their extreme sports holidays into a paying job. 'We were all really good friends and jumped together anyway and travelled together,' Marshall said. 'One day we were in Switzerland, staying in a little chalet cabin. We were paying for the trips on our own and two of us started talking and saying ""wouldn’t it be cool if we could somehow do this for a living?"" 'We thought it would be a good idea to approach GoPro and ask them if they wanted to sponsor us – that we would jump at their events. They said yes and each year we have worked with GoPro our relationship has grown and grown.' Sponsorship: GoPro Bomb Squad member Marshall Miller flies upside down in a light aircraft.

But the father-of-two, who lives in Alpine, Utah, with wife Nicole, was happy to give up property deals to pursue a life of high-altitude high-jinx. While the Bomb Squad are all high-performance athletes at the peak of their game, Marshall acknowledges that there is a real element of danger involved when the margin for error is so tiny. 'To fly a wingsuit along the ground for 30 seconds to a minute in the Alps, that’s really scary, but that the stuff I really like,' he said. 'There’s ways to control it for sure, but it’s definitely like you’re on the edge where any mistake you make you don’t don’t just crash, unfortunately you die. 'The other guys are all single, but I have a family, so I’m very aware of the safety aspect of it. This stuff’s really amazing and all,  but I definitely don’t want to die doing it!' Marshall's first experience with a parachute was a base jump off a 500ft tall bridge close to his home, with his wife standing by to film the event and offer moral support. 'I climbed over the rails and my wife . was saying ""Are you sure you know what you’re doing?"" but it all worked . out fine,' Marshall sad. 'I’m not sure if she was more scared or I . was.'

'I’ve had over 10,000 flights in my life, and at least 1,600 jumps,' Marshall added. 'It’s very, very exciting still. 'Every time I go do a demo jump, I have to pinch myself just to remind me that this is really what I do for a job. Every time I walk up to the helicopter I get this feeling of ""Okay, here we go, this is going to be awesome!""' 'Can't believe it': Mr Miller says he has to pinch himself to remind him this is what he gets paid to do .","Marshall Miller, Neil Amonson, Jesse Hall and Jt Holmes travel the world .

"By . Sarah Michael . When David Burder saw a two-man V8 chainsaw on display in New Zealand a few years ago his first thought was: 'I can make a better one'. So the self-confessed rev-head from Whitlands in rural northeast Victoria built his own one-man chainsaw, powered by a V8 engine salvaged from a 1979 Holden Commodore. Mr Burder, 56, is putting his 330kg monster chainsaw on show at the Fieldays agricultural technology expo in Hamilton, New Zealand this week. Scroll down for video . David Burder, from Whitlands in rural northeast Victoria, built a 330kg V8 chainsaw . The chainsaw is on display at the Fieldays agricultural technology expo in Hamilton, New Zealand . His creation is so powerful it can cut through a 600mm diameter hardwood log in 2.5 seconds. Mr Burder, who owns a wood splitter business in Whitlands, spent a year building the chainsaw in his spare time just for fun. 'I'm a bit of a V8 nut, a rev-head you might say,' he told MailOnline. 'It's just a great toy. My motto is ""He who has best toy wins"". Blokes will understand.' The 56-year-old self-confessed rev-head spent a year building the chainsaw in his spare time just for fun .

Most of the components were designed and made by Mr Burder or sourced through suppliers he uses for his business. The most difficult part was finding a suitable gearbox, which he eventually imported specially from Germany. Mr Burder said he had never seen anyone else make a one-man V8 chainsaw, and that his was safer than the two-man machines that are popular in the US. 'It's on a couple of little wheels so you can wheel it round and one person can use it quite safely,' he said. 'If you see the one Americans use, two people have got to pick them up and drop them on the log. If you tripped over all hell could break loose.' The machine is powered by a V8 engine salvaged from a 1979 Holden Commodore . Mr Burder's son Jared, 25, pictured using the one-man V8 chainsaw . The Fieldays expo has over 900 exhibitions but Mr Burder said his show always draws a big audience. 'We get an enormous crowd hanging around and it makes a lot of sawdust,' he said.

"By . Sami Mokbel In New York . Wojciech Szczesny insists Arsenal must forget last season's Barclays Premier League collapse as they look to win their first title since 2004. The Gunners were top of the table for 128 days last term, but a loss of form towards the end of the season saw them finish fourth. However, their poor finish was tempered by May's FA Cup win, their first trophy since 2005. Bigger and better: Arsenal are capable of winning the Premier League, goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny says . VIDEO Arteta expecting great season . And the £30million arrival of Alexis Sanchez has raised hope that Arsenal are finally ready to launch a sustained title assault. Szczesny agrees, but insists the club should not look back at how their championship challenge fell away last season. 'The time is over to reflect on last season's Premier League but we know we are strong enough to go and challenge again,' said Szczesny. 'We went 100 odd days at the top of the league and we believe we can finish top. 'The fact we were top for so long gives us belief, it shows we are good enough to do it. If we can just find that little bit of consistency towards the end of the season hopefully we can finish top. 'We've not lost any of our players, apart from [Bacary] Sagna, but we signed [Mathieu] Debuchy who is a very good right-back. 'We have signed Alexis Sanchez who is a massive player for us and I believe he is going to make a massive impact on the team. 'I think we are stronger and more experienced as well.

Opportunity: Mathieu Flamini says Arsenal can't waste their best chance to win the league title . Mathieu Flamini has echoed Szczesny and urged Arsenal not to waste their 'best chance ever' to win the Barclays Premier League. The Gunners will be among the early season favourites to lift the trophy next year following the arrival of Sanchez. Arsene Wenger's side fly to Austria on Monday for an intense four-day training camp before the Emirates Cup kicks off on Saturday. And midfielder Flamini reckons the Gunners are now well-placed to land their first title since 2004. 'I think now with the squad we have we have a good chance of winning the title, said the Frenchman. 'It could be our best ever chance. The club have shown great ambition with the signings so far and everyone is excited. 'We are stronger now and if we can cut out the mistakes we can do it. I am talking about learning from our experience. 'Perhaps some times last year we lost games too quickly. We have to learn from that.'

"By . Sarah Michael . Senator-elect Ricky Muir fumbled his way through a rare media interview on Sunday, struggling to answer questions about his political party's main topic of interest. The Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party senator, who is set to become one of the most powerful players in Australian politics in less than a month, got flustered while talking about the automobile industry with Channel Seven's Sunday Night. The 34-year-old will be part of a balance-of-power bloc along with the Palmer United Party (PUP) when he begins his six-year term in July. Scroll down for video . Newly-elected senator Ricky Muir got himself into a fluster during an interview with Channel Seven's Sunday night . The Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party senator struggled to answer questions about the automobile industry . On Sunday, veteran Seven reporter Mike Willesee asked Mr Muir to explain what he meant by the 'aftermarket' automobile industry, but the Victorian stumbled with his answer before taking a break. 'There's the aftermarket industry which can be supported ... people that are losing their jobs ... sorry ... can we start that question again?' Mr Muir said. 'There's the aftermarket industry ... which ... um ... sorry, can we go to another question? I've got myself into a fluster. 'The aftermarket industry is the industry that is ... can I go out for a minute?' After a short break, Mr Muir returns, and Mr Willesee advises him to answer questions as if he's talking to someone at a pub. Mr Muir, who has maintained his job at a timber mill ahead of the move to Canberra, also struggles to explain what it means to hold the balance of power in the Senate. Mr Muir, from the Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party, struggled to explain what it means to hold the balance of power in the Senate . Mike Willesee: Do you understand what balance of power means?Ricky Muir: Yes. It's the potential if... Ah, let's say in this case Labor and the Greens, um. It's the power to vote down legislation in the right circumstances.Correct answer: A balance of power (in reference to the Senate) is a position held by a minor party, independent or coalition which means their vote is necessary for legislation to be passed. MW: I don't know what you mean by [aftermarket industry]?RM: The aftermarket industry is the industry, um, that is... [To himself] Take a breath. Can I go out for a minute?Correct answer: The aftermarket automotive industry deals with car parts that are sold to consumers other than vehicle manufacturers (such as Ford or Holden). Aftermarket manufacturers make motor vehicle parts - such as tyres, seats, engines, batteries or brake pads - and sell to car repair shops or directly to consumers. The products are used to replace faulty parts, to modify cars or to maintain the performance of vehicles. 'Yes, it's the potential if, aah, say in this case Labor and the Greens, umm, it's the power to vote down legislation in the right circumstances,' he said. Mr Muir is usually camera shy but he made headlines shortly after he was elected in September last when a video surfaced on his YouTube account allegedly showing him taking part in a backyard kangaroo poo fight. The video has since been removed. PUP leader and businessman Clive Palmer on Monday attacked the Sunday Night program's story as 'biased and churlish'. 'Mike Willesee recorded about an hour of a really serious interview with me about political things and other things but he didn't show any of that,' he told ABC radio. 'He doesn't show you all of the footage. Just selective pieces.' Mr Palmer described Mr Muir as an 'ordinary' Australian. 'He's there because people think he's more in contact with the real world,' the Queensland lower house MP said. The interview with Mr Muir was part of a broader story on the PUP with which Mr Muir, a father-of-five from the Gippsland town of Heyfield, will join forces from next month when the Senate changes over. Jacqui Lambie, a former soldier and the PUP's Tasmanian senator-elect, doesn't hesitate when asked about her favourite weapon. 'Definitely M60 (submachine gun). Its massive firepower. Yeah, when you've got it in your hands,' she said. WA senator-elect Dio Wang said he would vote with his heart even if that means crossing Mr Palmer. Asked if he had stood up to Mr Palmer in the past, Mr Wang replied: 'Not yet, because he has been always right so far. The 34-year-old (pictured with Clive Palmer), from Victoria, will be part of a balance-of-power bloc along with the Palmer United Party when he begins his six-year term in July . 'He is already a great leader.' Come July 1, there will be three PUP senators, including Glenn 'The Brick with Eyes' Lazarus. Mr Muir was elected after securing 0.01 per cent of the primary vote. Mr Palmer is threatening to use his Senate team to block some of the federal coalition government's budget measures. Mr Muir, who will hold the balance of power in the Senate, also struggled to explain what that means .","Ricky Muir fumbled his way through a rare interview with Channel Seven .

"By . Sarah Michael . A great-grandmother who lost a book given to her by her father when she was a child has had the exact copy returned to her after 66 years and a trip halfway around the world. Betty Fowkes, 80, said she felt 'very emotional' about being reunited with the book which her father gave to her for Christmas in 1944 when she was 11 years old – and which still contains the gift inscription he wrote to her. Ms Fowkes' 48-year-old daughter Liz Crooks - who lives with her in St Andrews, north-east of Melbourne - found the copy of the book Magic Australia by Nuri Mass in a New York bookshop by a stroke of luck during a search online. Betty Fowkes (right) said she felt 'very emotional' after he daughter Liz Crooks (left) found a book her father gave to her for Christmas in 1944, which had been missing for 66 years . 'It's connected me dearly with my past again and my dad and it's just blown away all the years that I've lived and taken me right back to that time,' Ms Fowkes told MailOnline. The great-grandmother lived with her parents and two brothers in the Melbourne suburb of Northcote during World War II and times were tough for her family. So when Ms Fowkes was given the book by her father George Wardley - a major during the war - she treasured it. Magic Australia is a story book about two children who travel around Australia learning about their country. 'We didn't have toys in the war years and to be presented with the lovely new book, that's why it made such an impression on me,' she said. In 1948 her family moved from Northcote to Fairfield and the book got lost during the move. The gift inscription Ms Fowkes' father wrote to her when he gave her the book when she was 11 years old . Last month she was listening to the radio when she heard author Nuri Mass mentioned during a discussion about books. The name 'rang a bell' so Ms Fowkes asked her daughter to Google the name and check if she was the author of Magic Australia. Ms Crooks found that this was correct but she told her mother she was mistaken, planning to track down a first edition copy and surprise her for Mother's Day. Ms Crooks found a number of copies at second-hand book shops around the world and on a whim she decided to contact The Austin Book Shop in Queens, New York, because she had been a nurse at Austin Hospital in Melbourne for many years. In the book's condition report it mentioned there was a gift inscription so she contacted the shop to ask for more details. Ms Fowkes, 80, and Ms Crooks, 48, with the book Magic Australia at the home they share in St Andrews, north-east of Melbourne . Three days later Ms Crooks received a reply telling her the inscription read: 'To Betty, from Daddy. Christmas 1944'. Ms Crooks said when she got the email she felt like her heart had stopped. 'I thought ""Oh my god, it’s Mum’s book!""' she said. 'I just thought straight away Mum was going to be so happy.' But Ms Crooks said the fact that she found the right book straight away didn't strike her as particularly unusual. 'I don't expect anything less form the universe,' she said. Ms Fowkes as a child with her war veteran father George Wardley (left) and the book he gave her in 1944 (right) When she told her mother what she had found, Ms Fowkes was shocked and amazed. 'She had so many she could have tapped on to and just something made her do that,' Ms Fowkes said. They ordered the book and when it arrived last month and Ms Fowkes unwrapped the parcel with her hands trembling and tears in her eyes. 'I cried, naturally I cried for a long time. Just the hold of it again, it just felt that it was home where it belonged,' she said. Ms Fowkes wonders how the book ended up in New York after 66 years and she said the book shop had not been able to give her any clues. Ms Fowkes' daughter found the book in a stroke of luck at Austin Book Shop in Queens, New York . 'Lizzie did get in touch with these people to see if they could give us any idea about how they might be arrived by it,' Ms Fowkes said. 'But they didn't show any interest in our interest. 'The only thing we've come up with is that during those days it was war years and there could have been American soldiers here and maybe they saw the book and took it home for their children.' She added that the book is still in great condition, apart from a few drawings in lead pencil which she was able to rub out with bread crusts. 'There's not a page missing, not a page torn,' she said.","Betty Fowkes, 80, reunited with a book her father gave her in 1944 .

"By . Sarah Michael . and Ryan Lipman . Five seals in Victoria have been rescued after their necks became trapped in potentially fatal ropes, thanks to a new marine response unit. Graphic images released on Thursday  show the full extent of the damage caused by the plastic ropes which cut into the mammals' pelts and can cause the seals to die a slow, painful death from infection. The images, taken in December and January, show members of Melbourne Zoo's AGL Marine Response Unit saving the mostly young seals from entanglement. Scroll down for video . Second chance: A seal at Jan Juc, Victoria had a potentially fatal plastic rope caught around its neck and upper body removed by the Marine Response Unit . In the first image the Marine Response Unit is seen rescuing a seal at Jan Juc, near Torquay, after retrieving it in difficult conditions during a rising tide. The second image shows a seal at Chinaman's Hat in Port Phillip Bay suffering because a piece of packing tape was choking its neck. It was rescued and pictured just weeks later happy and back in the wild, with a shaved patch on its head so it could be identified. The fourth and fifth images show seals on the timbers at Chinaman's Hat, with one pictured with a tight rope around its neck. Seals like to pull themselves up onto the timbers to relax in the sun, so it is a place where entangled seals are often spotted. Seals are very curious and they instinctively play with floating objects in the water, such as seaweed. But when they play with floating rope or plastic it can loop around their neck, and they have no way of getting rid of it. A seal at Chinaman's Hat in Port Phillip Bay, Victoria, suffers from a tight piece of packing tape fastened around its neck . The seal that was saved from choking on packing tape was pictured weeks after being rescued back in the wild. It had a shaved patch on its head so the Marine Response Unit could identify it . Local tour boat operators often spot seals that have become tangled in plastic and report them to the Marine Response Unit. Melbourne Zoo vet Meg Curnick, who was involved in the rescue of the seal suffering due to packing tape at Chinaman's Hat, said the operations can difficult because seals duck into the water if humans try to approach them. 'The only way to get hold of that seal is to anaesthetise it and the only way to do that is to dart it with a dart gun,' Dr Curnick said. 'Often they'll shoot it and the seal's first instinct is to go in the water. 'Everyone needs to keep an extremely eagle eye on the animal in the water as it's slowing down and becoming sedated to grab hold of it.' Dr Curnick said the rescues were very tricky and there was a lot of luck involved. A seal at Chinaman's Hat has a rope fastened tightly around its neck . 'Sometimes you'll try and help a seal that's entangled and it's even possible that they will drown which is a horrible, but when the alternative is dying a slow death from infection from cutting wounds it's preferred.' Dr Curnick said young seals often get entangled because they are so curious they inspect a lot of things in the water. But as they grow larger the plastic cuts into their pelts and can cause deadly infection. The new Marine Response Unit was established in October last year and has since responded to more than 200 calls about wildlife caught in trouble. Wild Sea Keeper and AGL Marine Response Unit Coordinator Mark Keenan described the results as very positive for Victorian marine wildlife. 'To be able to respond to so many calls for assistance in our first season has been terrific,' Mr Keenan said. Seals like to pull themselves up onto the timbers at Chinaman's Hat to relax in the sun, so it is a place where entangled seals are often spotted . 'We were able to save five seals from entanglement, but unfortunately there were also a number of cases involving entangled, sick, or injured seals that couldn’t be saved.' At the time of its launch, Environment and Climate Change Minister Ryan Smith said the unit aimed to protect and care for Victoria's 'incredible marine wildlife.' The specialist unit is run of of Melbourne Zoo's Veterinary Department and head veterinarian Dr Michael Lynch said the marine response department had addressed an important need by becoming the state's first centralised point for marine wildlife welfare calls. Most marine wildlife calls are made in spring and summer coinciding with yearling seals being forced by their mothers to become fully independent as they prepare to give birth in November and December. Despite the work of the unit, some animals could not be save because of sickness, injury or entanglement .","Victorian marine wildlife response unit saved five entangled seals .

"By . Sarah Michael . A 16-year-old boy is in an induced coma following a tackle that caused him a serious head injury during a rugby league match in Bathurst on Thursday. Bathurst High School Year 11 student Tyler Horton collapsed off the field during a game against another local school and had to be airlifted to Westmead Hospital. Tyler's sister Emily Horton, 19, was at the game and witnessed the tackle. Tyler Horton is in an induced coma after he went in for a tackle at a high school rugby league game . 'He tackled pretty hard and got up and shook it off but I knew it must have been a bit of a knock because he worked his way to the side line waiting to come off,' Miss Horton told MailOnline. 'I could see he knew something was wrong, he quickly became unconscious and hasn't come around.' Miss Horton said Tyler was taken to Bathurst Hospital where he underwent scans and tests, and he was then was medically sedated and flown to Westmead Hospital. He was later operated on to relieve pressure on his brain. The Year 11 student plays rugby for the Bathurst High School team and he was on the field on Thursday afternoon when he suffered a horrific head injury . 'He's stable and still sedated having more tests and we're just waiting to hear more,' Miss Horton said. 'That's as much as I know right now, we are just lucky to have so many people care and have had unbelievable doctors, nurses and support.' Bathurst High School's principal Geoff Hastings said Tyler hit his head during the second half of the game on Thursday afternoon. 'We're not entirely sure but we think Tyler went into a tackle, it was just part of the normal flow of the game,' Mr Hastings told MailOnline. 'He came off the field and then collapsed.' The teenager's sister, Emily Horton, said he was now in a stable condition at Westmead but was still sedated . A Westmead Hospital spokeswoman told MailOnline Tyler was in a critical but stable condition on Friday afternoon. Mr Hastings said he had spoken to Tyler's parents who were dealing with the situation as best they could. 'Of course as any parent would if their child was hurt playing sport, they're worried and concerned,' he said. 'I think they're focused on his recovery... We've had very positive news about his recovery.' The 16-year-old, who goes to Bathurst High Campus (pictured), was rushed to Bathurst Hospital and then onto Westmead Hospital for further treatment . Mr Hastings said the school had been working with Tyler's schoolmates to help them cope with the news. 'Obviously they're upset, concerned and want to know how he's going, all that you'd expect when your friend's in hospital' he said. 'But they're coping extremely well.'

The 20-year-old woman appeared in Brisbane Magistrates Court on Tuesday charged with child cruelty and leaving her boys, aged two and four, unattended without making provision for their care on May 3 and 4. Police allegedly found faeces smeared on walls, a dead possum in the outdoor play area, rubbish and soiled nappies strewn across the floor and said the children's bedroom had an 'overpowering' bad smell when they searched the Keperra home in northwest Brisbane. A 20-year-old Brisbane woman has been charged with child cruelty after it was alleged her children lived in squalid conditions . Police went to the home for a welfare check on May 3 after a neighbour reported seeing the mother come home in a taxi at 10am, dressed as if she had been out all night, The Courier-Mail reported. Police say the four-year-old son answered the door and allege he smelt of urine. Officers asked for his mother and he went back inside the home. When the 20-year-old woman came to the door she allegedly scolded the boy shouting: 'You do not open the door to anyone … you don't even open the door for police.' The woman told police her children had been watched overnight by her mother and sister but police allege her claim was found to be untrue. Police allegedly found her two young sons covered in faeces after she had left them alone overnight. Pictured is the bathroom in the home in Keperra, northwest Brisbane . The next day police responded to another call from a neighbour who reported seeing the 2-year-old boy banging his head against a window. Police say the four-year-old again answered the door wearing a nappy 'full of faeces'. The woman was found asleep in her bedroom. She was arrested and charged and child protection detectives attended the home. The mother received bail on Tuesday and will face court again next month.

"By . Sarah Michael . Kira Griffiths, 25, received abusive text messages after she used taxi app goCatch to book a ride for a colleague on Tuesday . A Melbourne woman says she fears for her safety after she received multiple abusive text messages from a taxi driver when she failed to get into a ride booked using a smartphone app. This comes as the taxi industry has warned that independent apps which provide direct customer-to-driver contact can leave passengers open to abuse. Kira Griffiths, 25, used taxi app goCatch to book a taxi for a colleague on Tuesday but when she walked outside she could not find the cab, so her colleague walked up the road to get another one. Ms Griffiths then received three text messages and a missed phone call from taxi driver Arif Hameed calling her a number of derogatory names because she wasted his time. 'F***in b****,' one message read. 'I curse you s*** w**** someone will waste ur time like u did mine b****,' read another. Mr Hameed told MailOnline on Thursday he felt his privacy had been violated because Ms Griffiths posted his phone number onto her Facebook page along with his abusive messages. 'Since that day I am getting calls from private numbers and people are abusing me,' he said. 'I have her phone number I can give it to the media too but I won't do that.' Mr Hameed said he knew his actions were wrong but he was upset that Ms Griffiths made him wait. Scroll down for video . Ms Griffiths then received three text messages and a missed phone call from taxi driver Arif Hameed . 'When I went there I gave her a call and she said I'm coming out. Twenty minutes I waited,' he said. 'Our time is important as well. That's what frustrated me I just lost myself for two minutes.' He added that he had tried to apologise to Ms Griffiths via email through the taxi company he works for, Silver Top Taxis Melbourne. GoCatch said the company had blocked Mr Hameed permanently,  and said it has banned more than 500 drivers in the past three months for not meeting professional standards. GoCatch is an app independent from a taxi network, which connects registered taxi drivers with passengers directly by giving drivers passengers' mobile numbers. Ms Griffiths, a sales and marketing assistant, said the experience was scary and she was having trouble sleeping. 'It was such a personal attack on me over such a little thing,' Ms Griffiths told MailOnline. 'He could have been outside ready to go inside because he knew the pickup address. Ms Griffiths said the experience was scary and she had fears for her safety . 'He could come back here. He's seen my face now which is the more scary bit.' Ms Griffith said she was even more worried now because her complaints will see Mr Hameed potentially lose his taxi license and he still has her phone number. 'Thoughts have gone through my mind like that which is not nice,' she said. 'The reason I have those thoughts is because it was such an irrational and unnecessary action [over wasting his time]. 'Because what I've done now is worse, he could do worse than just the text message.' Australian Taxi Industry Association chief Blair Davies, who represents the taxi networks in competition with apps such as GoCatch, said passengers have a right to keep their contact details private. 'It's a flaw in the system which allows their details be available to a driver and for the driver to then be able to harass them,' Mr Davies said. The 25-year-old Melbourne woman has complained to the Victorian Taxi Services Commission . 'And it's good to be able to have somebody like a taxi company who provides a screening point or a booking point.' Ms Griffiths has complained to Silver Top Taxi Melbourne and the Victorian Taxi Services Commission. The Victorian Taxi Services Commission told MailOnline the matter is being investigated. Silver Top did not respond to the MailOnline's request for comment. GoCatch CEO Andrew Campbell said the driver's account had been permanently suspended and the company had apologised to Ms Griffiths. 'The company condemns the actions of this irresponsible driver in the strongest possible terms,' he said. 'We have provided his data and details to the Victorian Taxi Services Commission for investigation and in all likelihood he will never drive a taxi again.' He added  that by reducing anonymity goCatch was making taxis safer. 'For example if you just flagged a taxi on the street and the driver drops you at home and then starts harassing you, you don't know who he is, you have little recourse,' he said. 'But with goCatch we've got all the data and all the details so they can be passed on to the regulators or the police if need be.' Graeme Samuel, chair of the Victorian Taxi Services Commission, said millions of people use apps like goCatch, Ingogo and Uber across the world. 'It's a matter of choice for customers if they want to provide their phone numbers, if they don't they won't use the app,' Mr Samuel said. 'I don't think it's a question of regulators stepping in.'","Kira Griffiths called a 's*** w****' by taxi driver she booked using goCatch .

"By . Paul Newman . Follow @@Paul_NewmanDM . There would be no more symbolic sight than Moeen Ali walking down the pavilion steps at Lord’s next month to make his Test debut for England. It would be a triumph for modern society as well as this hugely talented cricketer. Moeen knows that if that day comes — and there is every chance England will pick him to be their all-rounder against Sri Lanka — he will initially gain as much attention for his physical appearance as his wristy batting and attacking off-spin. That is fine by him. For, with his luxuriant beard to the fore, he wants to be a role model not just for the Muslim community but any young cricketer treading the same path that he did growing up in multi-cultural Birmingham. We have returned to the area in the east of England’s second city where Moeen emerged from a quite extra-ordinary British Asian family. We are here for a StreetChance coaching session and the kids are hanging on his every word. Foot in the door: Moeen Ali hopes to make his Test debut for England against Sri Lanka next month . A tape-ball (a tennis ball wrapped in tape to give it more weight) is used in the playground of the Hodge Hill Sports and Enterprise College, just as it was in the back garden arena that his father and uncle, twins who married sisters, set up for him and his cricketing brothers and cousins. This is about showing that anyone from any background can enjoy cricket. ‘We all played in my family and cricket has always been in the blood,’ said Moeen before joining up with the England Twenty20 squad for their match against Sri Lanka at The Kia Oval on Tuesday. ‘We didn’t really worry about education because we all thought we would end up playing cricket. I think my dad always believed I would play for  England, probably more than I believed it, but it never crossed our minds that we weren’t going to make it.’ The aspiration was always to play for England. Moeen is as proud to come from Birmingham, as he is of following Islam. ‘A lot of Asians I’ve met have said, “Why don’t you play for Pakistan?”, but for me it was always about playing for England,’ he said. Roots: Ali wants more young British Asians to support England rather than India or Pakistan . Role model: The England all-rounder coaches young kids in his home city Birmingham . 'My job as a Muslim is to change all the negativity about Islam' ‘This is my country, this is where I was born. I was saying to (England captain) Alastair Cook the other day that as soon as I land or drive into Birmingham I feel at home. No matter where I’ve been in the world. It’s really special. I like to see the kids in my area wearing England shirts, not Pakistan or India ones. A lot of it comes from the older generations but it’s changing slowly, especially if people like myself and Ravi Bopara are playing for England. I would like to see that change a bit more.’ The beard that is an outward sign of his faith is as important to him as his background. ‘I wear the beard as a label,’ he said. ‘Religion is very important to me. One of my aims is to try to show that you can have faith and play cricket. There can be a lot of negativity and misunderstanding of Islam. ‘I feel my job as a Muslim is to change that and show people what my faith is really like. A lot of what is said and written is ridiculous but that’s life. I just get on with it and try to be as positive as I can.’ On the scene: Ali made his international debut in the Caribbean in a one-day series against West Indies . In the swing: Ali in action for Worcestershire . Those aims stretch to encouraging British Asians to be more inclusive themselves. For Moeen, who named his son born last year Abu Bakr in honour of the first man to accept Islam, believes that they can be as much at fault as traditional English clubs for sometimes not opening their doors to all races. ‘A kid came up to me and said, “Can you recommend a club where I won’t experience racism?”. I told him, “Every club”. People use race and religion as an excuse. I can honestly say there are no barriers if you work hard. ‘I don’t think there’s any prejudice. My club, Moseley Ashfield, welcomed us with open arms and was a great place for a young player to go and learn. It can work both ways. A lot of Asians need to be a bit more open to going out there and giving it a crack rather than having some sort of problem joining a club. They can perhaps presume  prejudice when it isn’t there.’ Moeen insists he has never experienced racism during his career with Warwickshire, Worcestershire and now England. ‘People outside cricket might be surprised just how accommodating every team I’ve played in have been,’ he said. ‘I was really surprised how nice and understanding everyone is. Worcestershire have been unbelievable, which is one of the reasons why I signed long-term. When it’s time to pray they let me and when I need to do stuff, I do it. ‘I’ve never once experienced racism from any other player. You experience ignorance but that’s not the same thing at all and I’m always willing to discuss things. If that helps people learn that there’s nothing to fear from Islam that’s great. I can show these kids here today that you don’t have to change to fit in.’ The predominantly Asian children taking part in the StreetChance session love every minute of their time with Moeen. Values: Ali's beard is a sign that he is very religious and he wants to change views on Islam . ‘My aim is just to try to inspire them to play, even if it is just one kid out there — to try to get them to push themselves and to show them it’s not impossible to do very well at the game. ‘Even when you see someone on TV it’s not quite the same as seeing them in the flesh at something like this. I can meet people and tell them that I came from exactly the same background and did exactly the same things as them at school. I remember Warwickshire’s Asif Din coming to my school and I thought, “This is what I want to do. I want to play cricket”. That’s the message I want to get across.’ It is a message he can get across even more if he plays at Lord’s on June 12. If he does, then watch out for the new mystery spin delivery he has been working on with Saeed Ajmal, a master of the art, at New Road. ‘Saeed is teaching me a few tricks,’ he said. ‘I’ve been working with him and soon I will be ready to show my skills. I’d like to be the first England player to bowl the doosra (a delivery that spins in the opposite direction to the off-break, the off-spinner’s default ball). I’m not far away. I just need to reach the point where I know exactly what’s going to happen when I bowl it. It’s coming out nicely.’ Fine tuning: England trained at The Oval on Sunday ahead of their T20 international against Sri Lanka . In a spin: Pakistan's Saeed Ajmal, pictured playing for Worcestershire, has helped Ali with his bowling . Moeen, who, at nearly 27, has learnt his craft in county cricket, believes there is as much suspicion in England about mystery spin as about Islam. ‘Everybody is bowling it now apart from us but every young off-spinner in this country should be taught how to bowl a doosra,’ said Moeen. ‘It’s happened in other countries for a long time now but we always seem to have a problem with it and somehow feel it’s going to destroy our spinners. We never seem open to these kind of things but we will have to be and I think we are slowly realising that people can’t just bowl orthodox off-spin any more. ‘Our batsmen always struggle against mystery — everybody does — and you have to have it these days or you’re not going to last too long. ‘There are so many different actions out there with people who have kinks and I don’t see why I can’t get away with it. I have asked a lot of people and 95 per cent who have watched me have said they think my action is legal when I bowl it. I’m going to do it anyway and if the umpires call me for throwing they will call me. We shouldn’t be scared of it any more.’ He is an inspiring figure in more ways than one. Moeen Ali was coaching at a ‘StreetChance supported by Barclays Spaces for Sports’ session. Barclays supports programmes such as StreetChance as part of its 5 Million Young Futures commitment to provide the next generation with the skills they need to fulfil their potential.","Moeen Ali wants more young British Asians to support England .

"By . Sarah Michael . Australians have been warned to avoid all demonstrations and large-scale gatherings in Thailand and to monitor developments that might affect their safety after Thailand's army declared martial law before dawn on Tuesday. The surprise announcement in Bangkok intensifies the turbulent nation's deepening political crisis. The military, however, deny a coup d'etat is underway. Troops are patrolling the streets of Bangkok and Thai army chief Prayuth Chan-ocha appeared on all Thailand's TV channels in the middle of the night to order police off the streets of the nation's capital. Scroll down for video . Thai soldiers take up position on a street outside the Centre for the Administration of Peace and Order after soldiers were sent in to seize the centre on Tuesday in Bangkok . Pedestrians stroll past armed Thai soldiers in Bangkok on Tuesday after Thailand's army declared martial law . The army said in a statement that the military had taken the action to 'keep peace and order' and soldiers entered several private television stations in the capital. The military statement was signed by army chief Gen. Prayuth Chan-Ocha. It cited a 1914 law that gives it authority to intervene during times of crisis, and said it had taken the action because on-going mass rallies between political rivals 'could impact the country's security and safety of the lives and properties of the public.' THAILAND IN POLITICAL CRISIS . The move came after a six-month political stalemate, which has involved widespread anti-government demonstrations. Analysts have warned Thailand is on the brink of civil war and 28 people have been killed in clashes across the country. Thailand has been without a sitting parliament since December last year, when then-premier Yingluck Shinawatra refused to bow to pressure to step down but called an election for February in an attempt to ease unrest. Thai soldiers occupy the foyer of the National Broadcasting Services of Thailand television station in Bangkok . Thai soldiers use sand bags to fortify their position in the middle of a main intersection in Bangkok's shopping district . The February elections were sabotaged by the anti-government People's Democratic Reform Committee (PDRC), led by Suthep Thaugsuban. Election officials were unable to schedule a new poll before Yingluck was removed on May 7, after a court found her and nine of her ministers guilty of abuse of power. Thailand's acting prime minister Niwattumrong Boonsongpaisan insisted on Monday that his government will not resign, resisting pressure from a group of senators who are seeking ways to settle the country's political crisis, and from anti-government protesters who are demanding an appointed prime minister. TOURISTS WARNED ABOUT TERROR THREAT . A statement on the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade website posted on Tuesday warns tourists: 'We advise you to exercise a high degree of caution in Thailand due to the possibility of civil unrest and the threat of terrorist attack. You should pay close attention to your personal security at all times.' A spokesman for DFAT said the department understands the country's caretaker government is still in office. Thai soldiers in Bangkok's shopping district. Thailand's army declared martial law on Tuesday to restore order after six months of anti-government protests . Thailand's army declared martial law to restore order after six months of anti-government protests which have left the country without a functioning government . 'We are following these events closely and encourage all parties to resolve their political differences through peaceful democratic processes,' he said. 'The Department will continue to assess the implications of this development for Australian travellers and will update the travel advice accordingly.' Do not travel warnings have been issued for the southern provinces of Yala, Pattani, Narathiwat and Songkhla. SENATORS CALL FOR POLITICAL REFORMS . A group of about 70 senators, most of whom are seen as siding with the anti-government protesters, proposed a framework on Friday that calls for a government with full power to conduct political reforms. Acting Prime Minister Niwattumrong Boonsongpaisan and Justice Minister Chaikasem Nitisiri met with two representatives of the Senate in an undisclosed location Monday to avoid disruption from the protesters. Thai soldiers take their positions in the middle of a main intersection in Bangkok's shopping district . Thai soldiers walk outside the National Broadcasting Services of Thailand (NBT) building . In a statement following the meeting, Niwattumrong said the Cabinet cannot resign because 'it will be negligence of duty and against the constitution,' and insisted he 'can carry out duties and has full authority' as prime minister. The Cabinet has operated in a caretaker capacity with limited power since Yingluck dissolved the lower house in December in a failed bid to ease the political crisis. A new government cannot normally be named until there are elections, which anti-government demonstrators have vowed to block unless political reforms occur first. The Senate, the only functioning legislative body in the country, was seen as the last resort of the anti-government protesters, who are calling for an interim, unelected prime minister to be chosen. A Royal Thai Army soldier stands guard on an overpass outside a major shopping center in downtown Bangkok . WHY YINGLUCK WAS REMOVED . Earlier this month, the Constitutional Court removed Yingluck for nepotism along with nine Cabinet members in a case that many viewed as politically motivated. Protesters said her removal is not enough because she was replaced by an acting prime minister from the ruling party, Niwattumrong. Anti-government protesters say they are making their final push to oust the government and install an unelected prime minister and government. They have promised to call off their rallies if they are not successful by May 26, following six months of street demonstrations in which 28 people have died and hundreds of others have been injured. Thai anti-government protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban is greeted by his supporters during a march in Bangkok, Thailand, on Monday . The protesters on Monday began searching for members of the Cabinet at their residences to pressure them to resign, but did not find any. Labor unions representing about 20 state-owned enterprises vowed to go on strike Thursday to support the anti-government protesters, although several companies, including Thai Airways and the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand, said Monday that they would operate normally. CRISIS STARTED IN 2006 . Thailand's political crisis began in 2006, when Yingluck's brother, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, was toppled by a military coup after being accused of corruption, abuse of power and disrespect for King Bhumibol Adulyadej. Thaksin, a former telecommunications billionaire, remains highly popular among the poor in the north and northeast, and parties controlled by him have won every national election since 2001. The anti-government protesters, who are aligned with the opposition Democrat Party and backed by the country's traditional elites, say they want to remove all traces of his political machine from politics. Thaksin's supporters, known as the Red Shirts, have staged a rally in Bangkok's western outskirts since May 10, raising concerns about possible clashes between them and the anti-government protesters.

Shameem Rahman, a 46-year-old married father of five from Upper Coomera on the Gold Coast, jumped the armed guard after he exited his van about 7.40am on Monday morning to make a cash delivery to the Highland Park Tavern. The two men wrestled to the ground and during the scuffle three shots were fired by the security guard leaving the assailant dead. Shot and killed: Shameem Rahman died after attempted to carry out the armed robbery on a former colleague . 'Traumatic situation': A security guard is consoled by police after opening fire and shooting a former colleague dead during a robbery attempt on the Gold Coast on Monday . Rahman worked at Border Security but was laid off earlier this year and it is believed he was trying to use his knowledge of the firm's security procedures to rob the guard, 47, as he delivered the pub's daily float, The Courier-Mail reported. The 46-year-old wore a motorcycle helmet to hide his face and he pulled a 9mm replica handgun on his former workmate. It was only after police removed the helmet that the guard found out he had killed a former colleague. The security guard's lawyer Jason Jacobson said the man was emotionally and physically injured. 'He's still in a very bad way today,' Mr Jacobson told MailOnline on Tuesday. 'He's getting the appropriate support from medical professionals to deal with the trauma of what he dealt with yesterday.'

Mr Jacobson said the man was bashed to the head with the offender's gun and was involved in a violent struggle. He added that his client was licensed to carry a gun and said he did not expect the man to be charged. Rahman was unemployed and had not been charged with a criminal offence in over 15 years. Police believe he was acting alone. Border Security general manager Leanne Walsh said the company's wishes were with all persons involved and their families. 'We are able to report that whilst our guard was visibly upset and traumatised by yesterday’s incident, he has our full and unconditional support and is receiving counselling and assistance to get through this difficult time,' Ms Walsh said in a statement on Tuesday.

"By . Sarah Dean . and Sarah Michael . The man at the center of a bitter feud between State of Origin coach Laurie Daley and Ray Hadley has denied having an affair with the broadcaster's estranged wife. Assistant Blues coach Matt Parish has maintained his relationship with Suzanne Hadley began after she lodged an AVO against her husband in February. 'I didn't even know Suzanne before that,' Parish told The Daily Telegraph. 'Whatever I am doing, it's my private life. It's being dragged through the mill by him (Hadley),' he added. Matt Parish, pictured here during a coaching stint with the Salford City Reds in the English Super League, has denied an affair with Ray Hadley's wife . Ray Hadley (right) has opened up about his split from his wife Suzanne (left), pictured here at the Australian Commercial Radio Awards in 2006 . On Friday Hadley spoke out about his split from wife Suzanne for the first time, describing it as his 'biggest personal challenge'. The 2GB radio host is  in the midst of an almighty blue with NSW coach Laurie Daley in the lead up to State of Origin, with Hadley accused of trying to have a Blues assistant fired over his relationship with the shock jock's estranged wife. Mr Hadley addressed the accusations on his radio show on Friday morning, saying all he was trying to do was 'get some dignity from a very undignified situation'. 'I've never been one to be overwhelmed by things, but this year has provided me with no doubt my biggest personal challenge,' Mr Hadley said. Scroll down for video . 'At times I've felt like staying in bed and not coming here [to work]. 'Listeners have to understand that despite the fact I'm on the wireless I face exactly the same problems off air as you do every day.' NSW coach Daley says Hadley is attempting to exert his 'influence and power' to have Matt Parish sacked from the Blues' coaching set-up, after the assistant coach was spotted with Suzanne. Hadley phoned NSWRL CEO David Trodden last week and warned him that Parish should be 'more circumspect in matters relating to my wife', The Daily Telegraph reports. The shock jock, pictured here in 2010, described his marriage breakdown as his 'biggest personal challenge' Daley also claims Hadley is trying to 'derail' the Blues' entire Origin campaign, which has already been beset by the Mitchell Pearce controversy. But Daley and Parish were supported unanimously at an unscheduled board meeting held on Monday following the phone call between Hadley and Trodden, according to the Telegraph. On Friday Hadley said he has had one phone conversation with Daley, after Daley phoned him last Tuesday week. 'He was very supportive and offered his friendship, that’s a friendship that has been in existence for almost 30 years,’ he said. 'From my point of view nothing has changed.' Hadley added: 'I've told my former wife previously and repeat today, I wish her well and hope she can find happiness.' Hadley, who leads rugby league talkback show Continuous Call Team, used his 9am to midday slot on 2GB radio station to discuss the Blues, Daley and Trodden three times this week. 'He is using his personal attacks on me on air as a way of getting to Matt Parish,' Daley said. Hadley last night denied having put any pressure on NSW officials to dump Parish from the Origin staff. He has admitted he spoke to Trodden about Parish and his estranged wife, who have been seen together at NRL events. Laurie Daley, pictured here coaching the Blues in 2013, says Ray Hadley is trying to have assistant coach David Parish sacked and derail NSW's Origin campaign . 'I simply asked Dave Trodden to advise Matt Parish to be more circumspect in matters involving my wife,' he said. 'I deny I asked for him to be sacked.' Hadley has been married to Suzanne since 1994. They are currently separated after she applied for an Apprehended Violence Order against him and his policeman son Daniel on Feb 20 and then withdrew it a few days later. Earlier this week Blues halfback Mitchell Pearce was involved in a nightclub row after a woman claimed he approached her on the dance floor at a popular Sydney drinking spot. The woman has declined to press charges over the incident and Pearce has been disciplined by his NRL club the Sydney Roosters but is still expected to be named in the NSW team for the first Origin match on May 28. Ray Hadley, a 2GB shock jock and rugby league commentator, admits he spoke to NSWRL boss David Trodden about Matt Parish and his wife Suzanne .","Matt Parish says relationship with Suzanne Hadley started after she split from her radio host husband .

"By . Mike Dawes . Alastair Cook has once again defiantly stated he wants to remain England captain and is unfazed by former team-mate Kevin Pietersen's assertion he should resign. Cook has faced calls from several former skippers of the national side to stand down, with Pietersen, who was sacked by England in the wake of the Ashes whitewash, the latest to criticise the left-handed opener's leadership. In his column for the Daily Telegraph, outspoken Pietersen wrote that Cook is only in the job because it would be 'yet another PR disaster' for the England and Wales Cricket Board to sack him now.

But even though he has presided over seven Test defeats in nine matches and is going through a dreadful run of form personally, Cook is keen to continue as captain. 'The last three or four weeks, everyone's been saying that. It is no different who else says it,' Cook said. 'I've just got to stay true to myself and say how good it would be if I could get through this as a person, as a player, as a leader and take huge strides from it. 'I'm desperate to carry on because I love being England captain, it's a huge honour.

'The good news in a five Test match series is you've got chance to bounce back and you get judged at the end of the series.

"By . Mike Dawes . Bernhard Langer will take an eight-shot lead into the final round of the Senior Open at Royal Porthcawl. The 56-year-old German began the third round with a seven-stroke advantage over Colin Montgomerie and England's Chris Williams and he tightened his grip with a three-under-par round of 68. Montgomerie had been hoping to exert some pressure on his former Ryder Cup team-mate but after a three-under-par front nine of 32, he ran into trouble after the turn, carding a double bogey on the 10th followed by a bogey in the 11th, before dropping another shot on the 17th when his tee shot ran into unraked spikemarks in a bunker. Leader: Bernhard Langer has an eight-shot lead going into the final round at Royal Porthcawl . Swing: He is taking part in the Senior Open Championship . Atmospheric: Langer walks up the 18th hole during the third round .

Instead, it was Canada's Rick Gibson, winner of the Bad Ragaz PGA Seniors Open earlier this month, who moved into second place on six under par with a round of 66. Langer's eight-shot cushion is a new 54-hole record and it is difficult to imagine him not converting that into a second title to go alongside his victory at Carnoustie in 2010.'I am one step closer,' he said 'I still have 18 holes to go.

"By . Sarah Michael . and Freya Noble . Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop was man-handled by angry protesters and had to be protected by her security team as university students ambushed her over cuts to the tertiary education system in Sydney on Friday. Students from the University of Sydney surrounded Ms Bishop as she walked up stairs to the MacLaurin Hall, chanting 'No Cuts, No Fees, No corporate universities,' while others simply yelled 'shame on you.' The minister's security and police surrounded her, leading her up the stairs and through a set of double doors out of the firing line. Scroll down for video . Minster for Foreign Affairs Julie Bishop was shoved by Sydney University students on Friday unhappy with cuts to higher education . Students were protesting the government's announcement in its budget that universities will be able to set their own fees from 2016 . The MP visited the university to meet the first group of students travelling to Singapore under the government's New Colombo Plan, which sees undergraduates undertaking study in the Indo-Pacific region. Bebe D'Souza from the Sydney University Union told the ABC the minister seemed unfazed by the confrontation. 'Julie Bishop came up the stairs surrounded by police and then all of the students kind of surrounded [her] and the police. The minister quickly made her way up the stairs before she was ambushed . Ms Bishop faced a crowd of protestors chanting 'No Cuts, No Fees, No corporate universities' '[She] kind of just like looked bemused, she didn't look shameful at all, she looked proud of what she was doing.' Earlier on Friday, a similar incident during Ms Bishop's address to audience at the opening of the Australia-China Relations Institute at UTS. A spokeswoman for the minister told The Sydney Morning Herald both Ms Bishop's university engagements on Friday 'proceeded happily.' Security had to restrain students from trying to reach the doors Ms Bishop had just passed through . Security and police surrounded the minister as students yelled 'shame' Authorities had trouble containing the crowd and keeping the doors shut . 'Minister Bishop was at UTS to launch a new Australia-China Relations Institute and at Sydney University to award government-funded opportunities under the New Colombo Plan for 1000 students to study in Asia,' the spokeswoman said. Students chanted the same lines, before the protest later spilled on to Sydney Univeristy. On Tuesday during the budget it was announced that universities would be allowed to set their own tuition fees from 2016, and for the first time students will pay real interest on their HECS debts . Students will pay upwards of $120,000 for university degrees and will face more expensive loan repayments under a deregulated fee system, a leading education expert has warned. More... 'Built on lies': Opposition leader Bill Shorten hits back at Government's tough budget, vowing to protect pensioners and low income earners . Tony Abbott open to 'horse trading' to get his first budget through Senate as NSW rejects $7 charge for public hospital visits . Bruce Chapman, who designed the HECS loan scheme, said changes to university funding in the federal budget would see students paying at least two and possibly three times as much for their education. More than 200 students turned out to oppose student fee deregulation at the University of New South Wales on Wednesday . Professor Chapman, director of policy impact at the Australian National University, said this is likely to see universities increase their tuition fees to international student fee levels, which are currently about three times higher, The Sydney Morning Herald reported. National Union of Students president Deanna Taylor said university fee deregulation was frightening . 'I would be very surprised if they're less than double,' Professor Chapman told MailOnline. 'Roughly speaking the average increase will be 100 per cent or more.' Professor Chapman said the Group of Eight universities would increase the fees as soon as they could 'because they have the market power'. 'The group of eight has wanted this for quite a while and the reason is they know the market will bear it,' he said. 'They're allowed to go up to international charge so that's where they'll go. 'If they think there will be no implications for demand, which I don't think there will be, they'll do it.' The Group of Eight is made up of The University of Sydney, The University of New South Wales, The University of Queensland, The University of Melbourne, Australian National University, The University of Adelaide, the University of Western Australian and Monash University. Professor Chapman said the cost of a bachelor of medical science at the University of Sydney could rise from $24,000 to the international student cost of $120,000. National Union of Students president Deanna Taylor said the changes were frightening. 'And the scariest thing about fee deregulation is that you can't predict how bad it's going to be,' Ms Taylor said. 'It's a devastating outcome for students in rural and regional areas in particular, as well as low socio-economic and indigenous students who already face massive barriers to accessing higher education.' Under budget changes the higher education loans program will also become less generous, and students will have to pay real interest for the first time. Currently the rate at which HECS debt grows is indexed at CPI - 2.9 per cent - which means effectively there is no real interest on the debt. But under the changes the interest rate will be tied to the government bond rate, which is currently sitting at 3.85 per cent. UNSW students held a mock funeral for education as part of their protest, delivering a coffin to the Chancellery Building . 'That's almost a percentage increase overnight,' Ms Taylor said. 'There will be students who will begin their uni degree who won't know what their debt will be.' The government says it will cap the rate at 6 per cent. Graduates will also be made to start repaying the loans once they earn $50,638 from mid-2016, almost $700 less than now. Group of Eight chairman Ian Young said other budget measures would put downward pressure on fees. 'If universities want to charge a premium, they will have to convince students there is a real benefit to what they offer. This will keep us on our toes and force us to innovate,' he told the Herald. Also announced in the budget was the requirement that universities put $1 from every $5 raised from fee hikes into scholarships for disadvantaged students. The higher education loans program is set to become less generous, with graduates made to start repaying the loans once they earn $50,638 from mid-2016 . Funding will also be expanded to cover the funding of all students taking diploma and sub-bachelor courses. It's expected expanding places will lead to the government subsidising an extra 80,000 students by 2018 at a cost of $820 million. Treasurer Joe Hockey said the measures would help improve the quality of university education in Australia. 'Australia should have at least one university in the top 20 in the world, and more in the top 100,' Mr Hockey said while delivering his Budget speech in Canberra on Tuesday. 'The higher education sector is being held back and cannot compete with the best in the world. 'We need to set our sights higher.'","Julie Bishop ambushed at Sydney University over cuts to education .

"By . Joe Strange . Follow @@Joe_Strange . Just like a fine wine, Tim Howard is getting better with age. The 35-year-old proved as much on Tuesday evening when he put in arguably the greatest goalkeeping performance ever witnessed at a World Cup during the USA's narrow extra-time defeat to Belgium in Salvador. He conceded twice in that added 30 minutes, failing to stop Kevin de Bruyne's low strike and Romelu Lukaku's sweeping finish, but he had already won the hearts of a nation with a string of fine saves. VIDEO Scroll down to watch President Obama call to congratulate Tim Howard . Safe hands: USA goalkeeper Tim Howard made a record 15 saves in his country's World Cup defeat to Belgium . Mr Popular: Howard has been lauded as a national hero after his performance in Salvador on Tuesday . Glum: In the end Howard was unable to prevent the USA losing 2-1 in extra-time at the last 16 stage in Brazil . In total he kept Marc Wilmots' side out on 15 separate occasions - a new World Cup record - and almost helped his country reach the quarter-finals of the competition for the first time in 12 years. He has since received a congratulatory telephone call from president Barack Obama and seen a petition for his name to adorn an airport in Washington begin online. While the Tim Howard Washington National Airport is still some way off from becoming a reality, the transformation of the former MetroStars keeper from Manchester United flop to the most talked about player in world football - at least for a night - is complete. Howard began his career at Old Trafford in promising fashion after joining from Major League Soccer for around £3million in 2003, making a decisive penalty save to help the Red Devils win the Community Shield against Arsenal. He continued his impressive form in the Premier League, cementing his place as the club's No 1 goalkeeper ahead of Frenchman Fabian Barthez and Roy Carroll as Sir Alex Ferguson's side chased the title. But the honeymoon period didn't last for long. In the latter half of his first season in England, Howard fumbled a Benni McCarthy free-kick during a Champions League last 16 tie against Porto and allowed Costinha to fire home the rebound. New boy: Howard signed for Manchester United in 2003 but struggled to hold down a starting spot . Defining moment: Howard (right) looks devastated after conceding a decisive goal to Porto in 2004 . On the slide: Howard, pictured here after conceding a goal to Lyon in 2004, made a number of mistakes for United . United were out, Jose Mourinho famously ran down the touchline to celebrate and Howard's confidence was shot to bits. He lost his place in the side to Carroll but did recapture it in time to help secure a comfortable win against Championship side Millwall in the FA Cup final. The American continued his unconvincing performances during 2004-05, dropping in and out of the side as he failed to convince both Ferguson - and the United faithful - that he could be the long-term successor to the legendary Peter Schmeichel. Edwin van der Sar arrived the following summer and immediately went about doing just that. He became a commanding presence behind the Reds' talented back-four and undroppable from Ferguson's first choice lineup. Howard's brief stint in Manchester was effectively over. Fortunately for the ex-North Jersey Imperials star, he had impressed David Moyes enough for the then Everton manager to sign him on loan for the 2006-07 season. He'd be the Toffees' No 1, too. The faith shown in him by Moyes helped reinvigorate Howard's career on English soil. Gone was the nervous, error-prone keeper who appeared unable to cope with the pressure of playing for one of the world's biggest clubs, and in his place stood a man who relished the opportunity to pull on his gloves and perform each week. Faith: Everton boss David Moyes took a chance on Howard after his indifferent form at Old Trafford . On the up: Howard has revived his career at Everton and become one of the club's key players . Big impact: Howard even scored this incredible goal against Bolton at Goodison Park in January 2012 . Howard found his best form under the Scot, helping the Merseyside club qualify for the Europa League, reach the 2009 FA Cup final and consistently challenge towards the top end of the Premier League after making his move permanent a year after signing on loan. Along with Tim Cahill, Mikel Arteta and Phil Jagielka, he is viewed by many Evertonians as one of the most shrewd signings of Moyes' 11 years in charge. Some would even describe him as the club's best keeper since Neville Southall graced the blue half of Merseyside during the 1980s and 90s. That faith was tested in Moyes' final season at the helm when, uncharacteristically, he made a number of errors which cost Everton valuable points in their hunt for fourth place. A weak Kenwyne Jones header was conceded in a draw with Stoke and Fulham's Bryan Ruiz was allowed to score a lacklustre free-kick at Craven Cottage. In total, Howard could be directly blamed for at least five point-costing goals. When Roberto Martinez took over Moyes last summer, it appeared as if Everton's new boss was already planning for life without the veteran in his squad. Fresh start: Toffees boss Roberto Martinez has helped Howard find the best form of his career so far . No way through: Howard keeps out a low effort from Belgium's Divock Origi at the Arena Fonte Nova . Still got it: Howard keeps out an effort from Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud during a 1-1 draw last season . Joel Robles, a player Martinez had on loan during his time at Wigan, was signed from Atletico Madrid on a five-year deal. At just 23 when he signed, the Spaniard looked every inch like Howard's replacement. Fast forward almost a year and the picture is very different. Robles featured in just two Premier League fixtures last season as Howard - now in his mid-thirties - enjoyed his most consistent season in between the sticks. He ended the campaign with 15 top-flight clean sheets, a fifth place finish and a two-year extension on his contract, keeping him on Merseyside until at least 2018. He'll be 39 when his deal runs out. After watching Howard in action over the past year, Everton fans won't have been too surprised to see their player shine on the biggest stage of them all. Incredibly, he seems to be improving the older he gets. If he can continue the trend at club level, a final farewell in Russia in four years' time might not be such a far-fetched prospect for America's latest hero.","Howard made a record 15 saves against Belgium in the World Cup .

After 120 bruising minutes and only a heartbreaking extra-time defeat against Belgium to show for their efforts, it would be easy for both the USA squad - and their legion of fans - to feel distraught after crashing out of the World Cup. The pain of Tuesday night's last 16 tie in Salvador won't have disappeared just yet, but Jurgen Klinsmann and his players have plenty of reasons for optimism following arguably the bravest loss of the tournament so far. As veterans of the international scene Clint Dempsey, Tim Howard and DaMarcus Beasley battled away at the Arena Fonte Nova, America's bright young things were busy putting forward their country's case as serious contenders for Russia in four years' time. Game over: Klinsmann (right) reacts as Belgium staff celebrate in the background . Down and out: USA stars Jermaine Jones (centre) and DaMarcus Beasley (right) look dejected after defeat . Finally beaten: Goalkeeper Tim Howard looks glum after conceding a Kevin de Bruyne goal in extra-time . Julian Green, only 19-years-old and making his first appearance in Brazil, scored with his opening touch to set up a dramatic finish against Marc Wilmots' much-fancied side. And although Klinsmann's men couldn't beat Thibaut Courtois again to force a penalty shootout, they deserve to leave South America with both pride and hope for the future. The impact of the young Bayern Munich forward, who controlled Michael Bradley's pinpoint pass with a brilliant first-time volley to reduce his side's two-goal deficit, gave supporters a glimpse of the country's emerging talent. With talisman Dempsey now 31 and the international career of record goalscorer Landon Donovan seemingly over, Green will be expected to become a major part of Team USA's attacking force. The early signs suggest he's ready to do just that. Born in Florida to an American father and a German mother, the versatile forward was picked up by the Bundesliga giants Bayern in 2010 and made his first team debut as a late substitute in a Champions League tie against CSKA Moscow last November. He represented Germany at various youth levels before being talked into swapping allegiances by Klinsmann, who has focused on convincing a number of players with dual nationality to start wearing the famous stars and stripes. Instant impact: Youngster Julian Green scores a volley to set up a dramatic finish in Salvador . Back in it: Green's strike beats Belgium goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois at the Arena Fonte Nova . Bright future: Green, who plays for German side Bayern Munich, runs off to celebrate his first World Cup goal . Speaking about Green after his side's narrow defeat, Klinsmann said: 'We knew that he was ready. 'He knew that he might get his chance today. It was just phenomenal the way he came in and scored that goal and gets us back. 'We just needed a little bit more. It was fun to watch that kid grow.' And grow he will. Green netted 15 goals in 23 games for Bayern Munich's second team last season, exhibiting his natural ability in front of goal in his first campaign as a professional. He has been linked with a move to Premier League side Tottenham in some quarters, although it is highly unlikely that Pep Guardiola would sanction a permanent transfer for one his club's most promising players. Fortunately for Klinsmann, who wants to stay on as USA boss until at least the next World Cup, Green isn't the only youngster threatening to mark his mark on the international stage for years to come. Big impression: Young defender DeAndre Yedlin (left) was a contender for Man of the Match after coming on . No way through: Yedlin (left), who plays for Seattle Sounders, tackles Belgium striker Divock Origi . Devastated: Seattle Sounders star Yedlin is left on the turf after the USA failed to find an equaliser on Tuesday . DeAndre Yedlin replaced injured right-back Fabian Johnson after 32 minutes in Salvador and, after the excellent Howard in the USA's goal, was easily the game's most impressive performer. The 20-year-old, who reportedly earns just £60,000 a year playing for Seattle Sounders in Major League Soccer, rampaged down Belgium's left-side, giving Red Devils defender Toby Alderweireld his most difficult game of the World Cup so far. Up against the likes of Eden Hazard and Kevin de Bruyne, Yedlin's commitment to getting forward, beating his man and delivering dangerous crosses was a breath of fresh air. His energy levels barely dipped despite his constant forays into Belgium's half and he dealt impressively with the attacking threat posed by Wilmots' expansive side, something noticed by his team-mate Howard. More to come: Klinsmann has reasons for optimism with talented young players continuing to emerge . 'He’s fearless. He gets forward. He’s strong, he’s fast,' said the Everton stopper. '(Eden) Hazard is no cake walk and I thought he handled him really, really well. Obviously, as the team got tired, we opened up, but when you talk about one-on-one, he won those battles.' Klinsmann has proved his credentials as an organiser and man-motivator, but with Green and Yedlin, plus Bradley, Johnson, Omar Gonzalez, Jozy Altidore and Aron Johannsson all coming into their prime or still developing, the future for the national team looks even brighter. Winning the 2018 World Cup may still be a few of steps too far for Klinsmann and Co, but you certainly wouldn't bet against this now football-mad nation continuing their development on the biggest stage.","USA lost 2-1 to Belgium after extra-time in their last 16 tie .

It might be one of the biggest games in the club's history, but Hull's players looked in relaxed mood ahead of their flight from Humberside airport to London for Saturday's FA Cup final. Manager Steve Bruce and his players flew south on Friday afternoon, just over 24 hours before they take on Arsenal at Wembley. Liam Rosenior, George Boyd, Yannick Sagbo and Tom Huddlestone were among the Tigers stars spotted in the departure lounge, while Bruce enjoyed a chat with son Alex before take-off. Onward bound! Hull City's players at Humberside Airport en route to London ahead of Saturday's clash . What's up? Goalkeeper Steve Harper appeared to be having some trouble with the sunshine on Humberside . Belief: Hull boss Bruce has called on his players to cause an upset against Arsenal in the FA Cup final . It's 20 years to the week since Bruce . lifted the FA Cup as captain of Manchester United and memories of that . illustrious day still burn as intensely as ever for 53-year-old. Bruce said: 'We must be rank outsiders, but that's the beauty of the FA Cup. Manchester City were huge favourites last year but Wigan came up and won the thing and that's why, for me, it's the greatest competition. 'For a club like ours to take on the mighty Arsenal has a fantastic ring to it. The club has never been there in its history, so it's a wonderful achievement. But you've got to try to grasp the occasion and enjoy it, because if you're not careful it just goes past you.' Bruce made his cup final debut in 1990 as United edged past Crystal Palace after a replay, and returned as captain four years later to marshal United to a stunning 4-0 final win over Glenn Hoddle's Chelsea. After also captaining United in a 1-0 final defeat to Everton in 1995, Bruce was left out of the side for the 1996 win over Liverpool due to injury. Bruce recalled: 'My first one was in 1990 and it was the showpiece, the pinnacle of the season. There was a clamour of it and I'm reminded of the intensity and of the attention.

'The memories of the FA Cup are the ones you cherish when you've finished your playing career. 'The ones you really remember are your FA Cup days and, believe me, it's far better when you've won one than when you've lost one.' On the face of it, the Tigers are hardly in the best of shapes going into their first final, having rounded off their Barclays Premier League campaign with a run of five successive games without a win. In addition, they are shorn of cup-tied frontmen Nikica Jelavic and Shane Long, and have doubts over a number of players including another striker in Sone Aluko and defender Paul McShane.

For Bruce, the poor end-of-season run which followed the tumultuous 5-3 semi-final win over Sheffield United was more than mere coincidence.

All they've thought about for four weeks is the FA Cup final. 'When you play for your youth team or your district team you want to do one thing - play in the FA Cup final.

The Southampton star has just enjoyed one of the best seasons of his career and is off to the World Cup with England, but some fans feel that his best years could be behind him. With that in mind, Sportsmail looks at five other players who proved that age is nothing but a number after joining a new club in their thirties. On the move: Southampton striker Rickie Lambert is set to join Liverpool for £4million this summer . Gordon Strachan - Manchester United to Leeds 1989, £200,000 . Strachan appeared set to leave Old Trafford for Sheffield Wednesday before Leeds boss Howard Wilkinson convinced him to drop down into the second tier. The Scot, who was 32 when he put pen to paper at Elland Road, proved to be an influential signing as he captained Leeds to the second division title in 1989-90 and became a popular figure among supporters. Strachan helped Leeds finish fourth in their first season back in the top-flight and reach the semi-finals of the League Cup. He was duly voted as the Football Writers' Association Player of the Year in 1991 for his tenacious midfield displays. On the run: Gordon Strachan skips away from Chelsea's Vinnie Jones (right) during a 1991 First Division clash . After signing a new contract, Strachan went on to win the first division title with Leeds in 1991-92 to etch himself into the club's history books. He represented the Yorkshire side for another two-and-a-half seasons before leaving to join Coventry City as a player and assistant manager. Influential: Strachan captained Leeds to the First Division title after leaving Manchester United at 32 . Gary McAllister - Coventry City to Liverpool 2000, free transfer . McAllister was snapped up on a free transfer by Gerard Houllier in the summer of 2000 after his contract at Coventry came to an end. At 35, some fans questioned his suitability to fit into Liverpool's dynamic starting XI. Those doubts didn't last for long. The Scot shone in the heart of the Reds' midfield and his experience proved instrumental as Houllier's side won three cups in 2001. Spot on: Gary McAllister scores a penalty in Liverpool's dramatic 5-4 UEFA Cup final win against Alaves in 2001 . McAllister scored Liverpool's opening penalty in their shootout victory against Birmingham City in the League Cup final, before coming on as a substitute to help turn a one-goal deficit into a dramatic 2-1 win against Arsenal in the FA Cup final. In the UEFA Cup final the following week, McAllister scored once and played his part in three more goals as Liverpool sealed a memorable 5-4 triumph against Alaves in Dortmund. He stayed at Anfield for another season before joining Coventry as player-manager in the summer of 2002. Experienced: McAllister helped Liverpool win three trophies during their memorable 2000-01 campaign . Teddy Sheringham – Portsmouth to West Ham United 2004, free transfer . After just one season at Portsmouth, Sheringham made the decision to drop down to the Championship and link up with Alan Pardew at West Ham. Then 38, the former Manchester United striker defied his age to score 20 league goals and finish as the division’s third-highest scorer. Sheringham’s impressive form helped the Hammers finish sixth and they secured promotion back to the Premier League with a 1-0 victory against Preston North End in the play-off final. Back of the net: Teddy Sheringham scores West Ham's equaliser in a 3-1 win against Blackburn in 2005 . The ex-Tottenham forward agreed a new contract with the club and managed seven top-flight goals in 31 appearances as the east London club stayed up. Sheringham also helped his side reach the FA Cup final against Liverpool in 2006, but his successful spot-kick in the penalty shootout was in vain as the Reds emerged victorious. The former England star managed one more campaign in the Premier League with West Ham before dropping back into the Championship for a final season at Colchester United. Danger man: Sheringham's goals helped West Ham win promotion back to the Premier League in 2005 . Brad Friedel – Aston Villa to Tottenham Hotspur 2011, free transfer . Following a successful three years with Aston Villa, Friedel opted to move south and join Tottenham on a free transfer in June 2011. The American stopper immediately became Spurs’ first choice keeper despite being 40, appearing in every Premier League game during his first season at the club. Harry Redknapp’s side finished fourth in the league with Friedel in between the sticks and reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup before being thrashed by Chelsea 5-1 at Wembley. Safe hands: Brad Friedel (left) has proved to be an excellent signing after arriving on a free transfer in 2011 . The former Blackburn keeper retained his place when Andre Villas-Boas took charge in the summer of 2012, but was gradually removed as the club’s No 1 after the arrival of France No 1 Hugo Lloris. At the age of 43 Friedel made nine appearances last season and kept three clean sheets. His current contract at White Hart Lane is due to expire next month, although he has been offered a new deal. Still going strong: Friedel has been offered a new deal with Tottenham at the age of 43 . Christophe Dugarry – Bordeaux to Birmingham City 2003, loan . Signed on loan from French side Bordeaux in January 2003, Dugarry proved to be an inspired acquisition as he helped Birmingham avoid relegation from the Premier League. The French World Cup winner, who was 31 when he moved to St Andrew’s, netted five goals in just four matches to save Blues from the drop. With his individual style and willingness to run at opposition defenders, Dugarry endeared himself to supporters and earned his status as a cult hero. Magician: Christophe Dugarry bends in a free-kick against Southampton at St Andrew's in April, 2003 . He joined the club permanently in the summer of 2003 but couldn’t replicate his initial impact, scoring just once in 15 appearances before leaving by mutual consent and joining Qatar SC. Dugarry hung up his boots in 2005 and has since been inducted into Birmingham’s Hall of Fame.

Roberto Martinez believes the introduction of a new division containing Premier League B teams is the perfect way to improve the fortunes of England's national side. The Everton boss has backed the idea of League Three - a fifth tier consisting of young teams from top-flight clubs - which was suggested by FA chairman Greg Dyke following a commission into the failings of the Three Lions. Despite opposition from some quarters, Martinez, who began his career playing for Real Zaragoza's second string, is convinced of the advantages that a Spanish style B team system would bring. Perfect: Everton boss Roberto Martinez believes a new 'League Three' would aid England's national side . Top table: FA chairman Greg Dyke (second from right) wants to introduce Premier League B teams . When asked whether Dyke's proposal could work in an interview with the Followtonians podcast, Martinez said: 'One hundred per cent. 'I first experienced B sides as a player. The B sides around France, Germany, Holland and Spain give the younger players an advantage. That's unfortunately where the English players are suffering when you go into European Championships and international games. You haven't got that first team experience. 'The B sides will work. The problem is how you're going to set it up and what parameters you're going to use. Young players need to play first team football, that's why we send our players out on loan and we see real benefits. 'The problem is that you can't control their way of playing or how you want them to be educated towards playing in the first team. The B sides are the answer.' Benefits: Martinez insists players need first-team football and that is why youngsters are currently loaned out . Under Dyke's initial plans, Premier League B teams would be allowed to play in the newly created League Three or the Conference. Promotion and relegation could be achieved across four divisions from League One downwards, although B teams would be restricted from making it up to the Championship and would not be permitted to play in the FA Cup. Martinez, who has afforded English duo Ross Barkley, 20, and John Stones, 19, plenty of playing time this season, admits that the rules concerning a new B team system would be key to its effectiveness. 'Will it work? It would depend on the small details,' Martinez said. 'What league is going to be set and whether promotion is going to be allowed. Are they going to play in cup competitions? Those minute details will be the difference between it being a success or not. 'But in terms of the development of young players, it's exactly what we need.' Foot on the ball: Martinez believes the plans are exactly what is needed to improve young English players . Former Brentford chairman Dyke has also expressed concerns about the amount of foreign players being granted work permits to play in England, with the commission recommending that those with non-EU visas should not be allowed to join clubs outside of the Premier League. Martinez is less convinced by suggestions that signing non-English players is the problem, particularly given Everton's desire to compete at the highest level on a relatively modest budget. He said: 'For us, it's about having good players. Whoever we sign in terms of the foreign market, Ross Barkley will play. 'We need to produce good players, but good players from abroad can be positive influences. I'm not too keen about restricting numbers in that respect.'","Roberto Martinez backs plans to introduce Premier League B teams .

Sometimes the simplest solution is best and so it came to pass that a change of footwear helped stop Novak Djokovic skidding out of these Championships. For two-and-a-quarter hours he slipped and stumbled, complaining about his trainers as he blew a one-set lead — losing the next two 6-3, 7-6 to Marin Cilic. At one stage, in the third set tiebreak, he lunged for a drop shot and got tangled in the net. The biggest fish in the draw didn’t look like he was worth keeping. Then came a signal to Boris Becker in the coaching seats and down came a new pair of shoes. He found his footing, his backhand and, more significantly, distracted himself for long enough to win the final two sets 6-2, 6-2. On the slide: Novak Djokovic had trouble with his footing against Marin Cilic . Footwear: Djokovic called for a change of shoes to get back in the match . ‘Maybe with the shoes it was just a mental thing,’ he said. ‘Whatever, it worked.’ What is in no doubt is the top seed will need to tighten up his act for his semi-final against Grigor Dimitrov. Normally so composed, it was surprising to see the Serb riled by the noise drifting into Court No 1 as Andy Murray’s defence of his title ended in the central arena. ‘I think both of us thought it was too much in a way,’ said Djokovic. ‘With Andy losing in straight sets, it was obviously a result that all stadiums, even on Court One, wanted to see. I said to the chair umpire, “Let’s just stop the match, put it live on the big screen and let’s watch it until they’re done. It’s going to be better for all of us”.’ With every groan, he got more agitated. His backhand, normally so effective, lost its direction, while Cilic emerged from an attack of nerves in the first set to dominate with huge groundstrokes. Going the distance: Djokovic needed five sets to beat Cilic . But in winning the third set he committed the error he felt turned the match in Djokovic’s favour. He had just broken the No 1 seed for 6-5 when he followed through on a smash and hit the net with his racket in the first point of his service game. He went on to lose his serve, which seemed academic when he won the tiebreak 7-4, but the effect lingered. ‘That changed the momentum around,’ said Cilic. ‘I ended up using too much energy for that third set. Mentally, as well.’ Then came the new shoes, a bit of silence outside and, ultimately, the turnaround as Djokovic broke serve twice in each of the fourth and fifth sets. At times he was brilliant, dominating the rallies and reading Cilic’s much-improved serve. But the concern will be that he has not regularly reached the levels he is known for. If there are any chinks in his armour it is likely Dimitrov will find them. One to beat: Dimitrov is the form player on grass this Championships . Djokovic said of the Bulgarian: ‘The fact that he hasn’t lost a match in the grass court season this year says enough about his quality. Also winning against Andy on grass. ‘I’m sure many people look at him as a potential Grand Slam winner. Maybe here, maybe in the Grand Slams to follow. His game has improved a lot. ‘A new wave is able to challenge the best and contend for Grand Slam titles.’ With that, he was asked about those shoes. ‘I have to think about that,’ he said. ‘If they’re lucky, I’ll wear them.’","Djokovic beat Cilic in five sets in quarter-final on Court No 1 .

The oldest swinger in town proved this week that he can still find his way around a golf course, embarrassing along the way a few of the younger generation who might want a place in his US Ryder Cup team. The seven shots that separated Tom Watson’s fourth-round score from that of Tiger Woods will, in likelihood, be used as a stick to beat 14-time major winner. But that would be unfair, albeit only to the 64-year-old. His brilliant, crafty round of 68 deserves recognition in its own right, proving as it did that the five-time winner of golf’s oldest major can still do damage from way back in the fairway. VIDEO Scroll down for highlights . Still got it: Tom Watson has proved at Hoylake this week that he can still hit with the best . Old master: The 64-year-old hit a final round 68 at The Open . The fact he does it with such a smile on his face makes it all the more regrettable to the neutral that next year’s Open at St Andrews will be his last. There won’t be another extension for a man who, having passed the entry cut-off of 60 years old, has received two rules exemptions to get him this far. Those were sentimental decisions and a fair recognition of his extraordinary second-place finish in 2009, but a greater truth is that this golfer is still too good – and popular - to be pensioned off. When the end appeared nigh, in the gloom of St Andrews in 2010 as he missed the cut in front of a small crowd, he fought back by making the cut in three of the next four years, including this one. In 2011, he was 22nd. ‘That was just a really good day,’ he said yesterday, after his four-under-par round left him on one over for the tournament. ‘Yep, I enjoyed that.

His gallery was one of the biggest of the day, as usual. ‘Terrible shot, Tom,’ laughed one old stager in the crowd after Watson found the green with a brilliant fairway wood at the 17th. Watson laughed back. Moments earlier, when he balanced on the edge of a bunker at the 16th and chipped sublimely along the contours to three feet, there was one of the biggest roars of the day. He claimed his fourth birdie of the round, tipped his hat and moved on. ‘Great play, Tom,’ said a young boy in full golf gear. ‘That’s very kind, thank you,’ came the reply. He remains a gentleman of the game, impeccable in his behaviour. When a group of teenagers oddly took to mocking his hair at the 18th, he smiled and walked on.

His drive had split the fairway. ‘I think, if I’m not mistaken, that I did not miss a fairway today,’ he said afterwards, before correcting himself. ‘Sorry, I missed it on 11.’ Wood missed four.

"By . Riath Al-Samarrai . Follow @@riathalsam . Last September, a tennis coach got on a plane for Los Angeles and started a two-day conversation that might just give the men’s game the shake-up it’s been waiting for, and might just cause Andy Murray a sleepless night. That coach was Roger Rasheed, a former Aussie Rules footballer and known gut-buster, and the prodigy he spoke to was Grigor Dimitrov, the then 22-year-old from a tough street in Bulgaria who had grown tired of his own hype. ‘He phoned me one day,’ Rasheed told Sportsmail. ‘I had watched him since he was 16. I had seen what he has to bring, his abilities. We agreed to meet.’ VIDEO Scroll down to watch Grigor Dimitrov save a fainting ball girl during his tennis match . Ready: Grigor Dimitrov thinks he is ready to break the mould after growing tired of his own hype . Return: Dimitrov has changed his opinion since 2011 and now wants to get rid of the Baby Fed label . Big hit: Dimitrov proved too flamboyant for his own good at times and had his controversies . Mats Wilander, the seven-time Grand Slam winner, tells Sportsmail what he makes of Grigor Dimitrov. 'I see Dimitrov as a Slam winner,' he says. 'The improvements he has made in the past year are obvious, though it wasn't obvious he would take the step up. 'I'd say he is at the front of the new players coming through. 'He is like a raw Roger Federer - not as polished but he has an excellent all-round game on all courts. 'He is a threat to Andy Murray and the rest already.' Dimitrov was the teenage star with the elegant style who in a three-month period in 2008 won the junior events at the US Open and Wimbledon. His former coach Peter Lundgren, who had once mentored Roger Federer, had said that at 18 he was further up the curve than the Swiss who won the lot. That’s where the Baby Fed tag came from; Dimitrov was flattered and quite liked it. ‘It’s great to hear,’ he said in June 2011. ‘I can hear this all day, put a ringtone on my phone, but you can’t compare the greatest player of all time to a dude that is 64 in the world.’ By the time Rasheed got on a plane in Australia, Dimitrov had won zero senior titles and the Baby Fed label annoyed him. He had reached the top 30 — and unwittingly played a part in a feud between Maria Sharapova and  Serena Williams, having dated both — but a player with that all-round game was deemed to be underachieving. He had all the shots but was often too flamboyant for his own good and he had been fined €2,000 in 2010 for shoving an umpire at a Challenger event. Comparison: Dimitrov has often been called 'Baby Fed' after Swiss master Roger Federer . Loosening up: Federer has a hit on the practice courts on the Middle Sunday of the Championships . Chilling: Federer talks to his coach Stefan Edberg during practice at Aorangi Park on Sunday . There were also suggestions that his fitness was not what it could be, a point underlined by Ivan Lendl last year: ‘That guy comes out so hot but we know he can’t sustain it. If he could he would be No 1 in the world.’ Perhaps those words were in his mind when he picked up the phone to Rasheed. ‘He saw he needed to make some legitimate changes,’ said Rasheed, who had worked with Lleyton Hewitt, Gael Monfils and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. ‘I have strong philosophies on what sort of people I want to work with — people with a genuine fuel for life. I flew to LA from Australia. We spoke a lot over two days before I flew back. 'I always ask “What do you want out of this?” Straight out he says he wants to be the No 1 player in the world. Right answer.’ Dimitrov has since won his first four senior titles. On Friday he twice fought back from a set down to beat Alexandr Dolgopolov in a five-set match. Shape: There were suggestions of Dimitrov's fitness and Ivan Lendl said he knew 'he can't sustain' Change: The best way for Dimitrov to respond to criticism of his fitness and attitude was on the court . His interviews have been dominated by his mentions of Rasheed and his new-found ability to endure fights that reach the later rounds; his irritation has been obvious when questions then turn to  Sharapova and that Baby Fed nickname. ‘I think it’s time for everyone to kind of come up with something better,’ he said on Friday. ‘I’m proving myself not only as a player but as a person outside of the court.’ That person, it is said by those around him, is desperately competitive, a man whose lifelong refusal to drink alcohol has bemused a woman even as driven as Sharapova. Much of it boils down to his upbringing as the only child of an ambitious tennis coach father, Dimitar, and a mother, Maria, who played high-level volleyball. By five years old he was playing matches. He describes home, a remote area in Haskovo, as being in a ‘tough neighbourhood — there was a lot of poverty’. Partner: Dimitrov and girlfriend Maria Sharapova out and about enjoying the London sunshine . On the march: French Open champion Sharapova has cruised through the first week of the Championships . Roar: Rasheed thinks 'it's time for everyone to kind of come up with something better' than Baby Fed . VIDEO Wimbledon: Day 6 roundup . Rasheed said: ‘His family are genuine, hard-working people, respectful people who respect  everyone. He is a copy of them. They respect the king and they would respect the person who picks up the garbage on Sunday. ‘The work ethic is very important. You have to understand how hard he had to work to come through like he did. ‘Bulgaria is not somewhere where you have a pool of players to compete against and push you on. He found a way to do it without that. ‘He has that drive. I’ve seen what he’s about when he trains. We have pushed him to some pretty  unstable points — that’s a hard place but a great place. But he has a look in his eyes. He loves it. It’s what he wants.’ Change: Rasheed says Dimitrov is hard working and respectful, much like the family life he comes from . The upshot is a place in the fourth round against Leonardo Mayer, the world No 59, then he faces a quarter-final against Murray if all goes to script. He beat the  Wimbledon champion earlier this year and it is a potential tie that fascinates observers of the game. No sport cries out for a new wave of champions quite like tennis; no player from that group of possible contenders carries quite the same weight of expectation as Dimitrov. The question is whether his time has come. Is it? Dimitrov needs to make his chances count and the question is whether his time has come .","Grigor Dimitrov wants to get rid of 'Baby Fed' branding .

Then Hawkeye was clapped into life and from the tightest of margins came a second chance for a wildcard teenager who survived nine match points to spring one of the biggest shocks of these Championships. On the other side of the net, Richard Gasquet, the 13th  seed, was shaking his head in disbelief. He knows a thing or two about teenage hype but — much like this match, in which he took a two-set lead and then lost 3-6, 6-7, 6-4, 7-5, 10-8 — his has been a story of talent not quite fulfilled. Richard Gasquet suffered a shock as he lost to Kyrgios in round two . Kyrgios celebrates a famous victory over Richard Gasquet . It’s anyone’s guess how far a prodigy can go in tennis, but already Kyrgios is racking up the endorsements. His first came from Andy Murray earlier this month,  when he labelled the 19-year-old ‘the next big Aussie star’. And Gasquet weighed in on Thursday night, saying: ‘He can be a top-five player and he can win a Grand Slam.’ The signs so far are more than encouraging for a player who remains outside the top 100 at 144, but who has made astonishing progress since  he decided five years ago to shelve thoughts of a career in basketball in favour of a sport he disliked when first introduced to it. ‘My mum brought me down to the local tennis centre in Canberra when I was seven and I wasn’t keen,’ he explained. ‘I didn’t want to play it. But I guess it wasn’t a bad choice.’ Gasquet congratulates Kyrgios after he beat him on Thursday . He has since acquired the junior title at the Australian Open,  the junior doubles title here and  yesterday took his first serious scalp from the elite. He did it with the fuel of a singing and dancing contingent of  Australians, a backing he encouraged with fist pumps and screams. When Kyrgios saved the first of those nine match points in the fourth set, he beat his chest and pointed at the noisy 10 or so fans in green and gold shirts. When he successfully challenged the fifth-set call made against his second serve at 6-5 Gasquet, advantage Gasquet, those Australians in the crowd responded with a rendition of the theme tune to the Rocky films. Day to remember: Kyrgios plays a return to Gasquet during the clash . He was spared by  millimetres in that instance, and then survived a further three match points in a wonderful finale. ‘We all know his potential,’ said Gasquet. In the ambitious mind of Kyrgios, the plan is for that potential to take him to world No 1, as he was in the juniors. ‘My goal is to become the best,’ he said. ‘It’s a long journey. This was my biggest career win.’ And a win which he followed immediately with a trip to the gym and thoughts of the 20-year-old Jiri Vesely, whom he faces in the next round after his fellow  wildcard knocked out Gael  Monfils, the 24th seed. The winner is likely to face Rafael Nadal for a fairytale opportunity in the fourth round.Meanwhile, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga emerged intact from a fourth straight day of play as he survived a major scare against Sam Querrey. Longest match: It took Kyrgios 233 minutes to defeat the Frenchman . Much like his first-round match against Jurgen Melzer, the 14th seed’s clash went to five sets and was split across two days. He resumed his second-round tie at two sets apiece and 9-9 with  Querrey serving, but the Frenchman battled through to win 4-6, 7-6, 6-7, 6-3, 14-12.

He guided Swansea to the Capital One Cup in 2012-13 – his first season in charge – and was rewarded with a two-year deal in February 2013 on improved terms. But, with the club’s form and results dipping as they juggled domestic and European football, Laudrup was sacked following a run of six defeats in eight Premier League fixtures. He recently agreed a settlement with Swansea chairman Huw Jenkins on the remaining 18 months of his contract. Sources close to Laudrup claim he has had ‘many offers’ since he was replaced at Swansea by Garry Monk. Lekhwiya were only founded five years ago, but have won the Qatar Stars League three of the past four seasons. Their chairman, Sheik Abdullah bin Nasser bin Abdullah Al Ahmed Al Thani, is from the Qatari ruling family. Eye for a player: Laudrup signed Spanish striker Michu from Rayo Vallecano for £2million .

It started with a twinge for one and ended with a whinge for the other, but two British players scored impressive victories on the opening day of the Aegon Championships at Queen’s Club. For James Ward, there was a fine straight-sets win over Blaz Rola, followed by a rather testy complaint in his press conference about questions on the subject of female coaches. Then there was Dan Evans, Britain’s No 2, who later in the afternoon pulled off a significant upset in the first round by knocking out Jurgen Melzer, a top-10 player three years ago. More impressively, Evans' win came against the backdrop of pain in his left knee that has lingered for nine months and will require a lay-off from the game after Wimbledon. Perfect start: Great Britain's Dan Evans celebrates victory over Jurgen Melzer in the first round of the Aegon Championships at Queen's Club .

Melzer, 33, pressed home his advantage, breaking early . in the third set. But . Evans first levelled and then excelled as the match went into another . tiebreak. He forced an early mini-break with a delightful backhand pass . down the line and led 5-2 when Melzer shanked a forehand into the . stands.

On the run: Evans stretches to make a forehand return on a sunny afternoon in west London . Solid start: James Ward plays a backhand on his way to a straight-sets win over Blaz Rola at Queen's . ‘It was a good . win,’ said Evans. ‘I played well, I took my chances when I needed them . and fought back from a break down in the third. It was a good day.’ Having . previously received punishments — including the cutting of his funding . in 2008 — from the LTA over his behaviour, Evans has apparently turned a . corner with a string of impressive results, such as a run to the last . 32 at the 2013 US Open. He added: ‘Obviously Wimbledon is where you want to win the matches because there are more points there. ‘Second, third, fourth round of Wimbledon would be pretty good.

Samantha's article . yesterday became a worldwide internet sensation and her . fiery response to her critics posted online earlier today, in which she says her 'detractors . have simply proved my point,' has again provoked a deluge of online . comments. Admittedly, not all were supportive with . many people saying she was 'delusional' and 'against feminism,' while others accused her of being . deliberately provocative. Some users however, rode to her defence and said she had a right to freedom of expression and several people said 'at least she is honest about her views.' The comment on today's article which received the most red arrows - meaning users did not like it- was from Christine in Salt Lake City, U.S. She wrote: 'This women has what every women wants !! SELF ESTEEM!!! Every women should be able to look at themselves as the most beautiful women in the world .You go girl!!!!' The comment which 8,240 users deemed a positive with green arrows was written by Rebs, in Dublin, Ireland. She wrote: 'We don't dislike you for thinking you are beautiful, that's fine. It's your arrogant deluded attitude that is annoying.' Samantha's original article and her response have been our two most read stories on the MailOnline for the past two days - gaining nearly 8,000 comments on the site between them and still growing. Today she stated: 'While I've been shocked and hurt by the global condemnation, I have just this to say: my detractors have simply proved my point. Their level of anger only underlines that no one in this world is more reviled than a pretty woman.' She adds that she isn't surprised Victoria Beckham has moved to Los Angeles as, as, in Samantha's words: 'She knows better than anyone how your looks can be used against you in Britain — here we reward false modesty instead and gang up against anyone who isn't suitably self-deprecating.'

Internet storm: Samantha, who lives with her French husband Pascal Rubinatin the Dordogne, could have had no idea what a reaction her piece would provoke . This chart shows how the search term 'Samantha Brick' exploded into life on Twitter today . Yesterday the top-rated comment . following her first piece was from Annie, in Toronto, Canada, who was . awarded an astonishing 18,000 'green arrows' from fellow readers for . saying Samantha needs a 'reality check'. But there's no doubting people found her tell-all interesting - since the confessional piece was published yesterday Samantha's story has racked up more than 1.5million hits on our site. The story has also been picked up and commented on by dozens more around the world as interest in it spread across the internet. It has been used on . everything from the The Daily Telegraph and The Independent's websites in the UK to . ABC News in the U.S. and fashion magazine Stylist. On Facebook nearly 50,000 shared it with their friends and at one point yesterday the story was the second top trend on Twitter as millions of people talked about it online. Samantha . was more discussed than James Murdoch quitting BSkyB, free ice cream . and all the other big news stories of the day and a spoof Twitter . account was also set up to poke fun at her. So what was it that got people so het up? BBC DJ Lauren Laverne posted a series of tweets about Samantha's article . Many of the comments alluded to Samantha's claim that women feel threatened by her. Speaking from her home in the Dordogne, France, Samantha . told the Mail: 'I'm not smug and I’m no flirt, yet over the years I've . been dropped by countless friends who felt threatened if I was merely in . the presence of their other halves. 'If their partners dared to actually . talk to me, a sudden chill would descend on the room. The Stylist magazine wrote a piece entitled 'We don't hate you Samantha Brick' in defence of the Daily Mail writer . She also said: 'While I’m no Elle . Macpherson, I'm tall, slim, blonde and, so I'm often told, a . good-looking woman. I know how lucky I am. 'But there are downsides to . being pretty — the main one being that other women hate me for no other . reason than my lovely looks.' These led to a strong of negative comments, but not all the reaction was against her. Figures show Samantha's story was the second top trending topic at one point today after 'Dear Nicki' India Andrews, from Los Angeles, California, said on MailOnline: 'You can't account for other people's reactions . to you. 'I'm smart, and I've intimidated people in a conversation . unintentionally many times or engendered jealousy in students during a . class unintentionally as well. 'Just live your life, and if someone tries . to get into your face about it, say ""okay"" and go about your life like . normal. 'Don't try to engage them in a conversation about it. My . experience is that you can't change their minds or their feelings.' In another of the best-rated comments, Alan Smyth, from Middlesbrough, said: 'Obviously a truly gorgeous person both . inside AND out. 'How sad to see the trolls sniping at her from 'neath . their gloomy bridges, they can NEVER touch her however! Sail on serenely . beautiful Ms Brick you deserve to laugh in the face of the jealous . beasts.' On Twitter, Sally Bercow, the reality TV star and the wife of Commons speaker John Bercow who is no stranger to being controversial herself, said sarcastically: 'I don't think I have had an Easter card. Ever. I bet Samantha Brick has had thousands...' BBC DJ Lauren Laverne posted a series of tweets about Samantha's article asking: 'Why do people WRITE articles lies this? And why am I reading it?' In an editorial entitled 'We don't hate you Samantha Brick' Stylist magazine also made its point. TV illusionist Derren Brown was one of a number of celebrities who took to Twitter after reading the story . It said: 'We believe Samantha Brick has had some unfortunate experiences with friends and colleagues, but this article is just another example of women attacking women - the very thing Samantha complains about. 'We're proud when our friends look their best and, we imagine, so are you. It's genuinely pleasant to watch a colleague light up when you compliment her skirt, or to walk into a room and see your closest friend looking just perfect. 'Think of the joy we all get from seeing a woman we love as a happy, sparkling bride. Let’s treat each other with generosity: let's celebrate.'","Samantha Brick provoked a strong reaction yesterday when she tried to explain why women feel threatened by her, while men lust after her .

"By . Joe Bernstein . Little did Marion Bartoli and Andy Murray realise when they celebrated their Wimbledon titles at the Champion’s Ball last year that they would soon have something else in common - coach Amelie  Mauresmo. Mauresmo was in Bartoli’s corner when she unexpectedly won Wimbledon as a 125-1 outsider at the age of 28, and now she has been handpicked by Murray to help him retain his singles title at SW19 in a week’s time. It is a decision that has caused shockwaves throughout the sporting world - the first time a leading men’s player has appointed a woman to be his coach. But Bartoli, able to give a unique insight into how the 34-year-old works, believes it is a move that will allow Murray to cope with the added pressure of being the first Briton to try and retain the men’s singles title at Wimbledon since Fred Perry in the Thirties. Happy times ahead: Andy Murray's decision to appoint Amelie Mauresmo as his coach was brave but not surprising says last year's Wimbledon champion Marion Bartolli . Before and after: Mauresmo took over coaching Bartolli (right) just months before her Wimbledon win, just as the French coach has done this year for Murray . Bartoli says: ‘I think it was an extremely brave choice by Andy because it’s the first time it’s happened. But I am not surprised by it because Andy is so smart and he’s never been afraid of taking risks. ‘It’s the right decision. Amelie was an important reason why I became a Wimbledon champion. ‘One of her main strengths is how she is able to deal with stress and transmit positive energy to her players. She has experience of winning Grand Slams herself. She is able to give great tactical advice without being in your face all the time. She’s got the presence where she doesn’t have to speak too often but when she does, you automatically listen.’ Bartoli only appointed Mauresmo to replace her father as main coach four months before last year’s Wimbledon and the impact was immediate. ‘She didn’t like me getting ready for each match too early,’ Bartoli says. ‘We’d do a little bit on tactics the night before, she’d ask how I was feeling about my game, but generally it wasn’t anything intense. Then 25 minutes before the match, the real warm-up began and you become this competitive tennis player.’ For those who worry that Mauresmo might be too austere for Murray’s quirky sense of humour, Bartoli assures us the Frenchwoman is a relaxed figure away from the public gaze, a bit like Murray’s previous coach Ivan Lendl who was a joker off-court while maintaining his stonewall persona when the cameras were on him watching matches. Calming influence: Bartoli, celebrating her 2013 Wimbledon final win with Mauresmo, has sung the coach's praise . Bartoli adds: ‘She really is a lot of fun. Our thing we’d do was to mimic pieces of dialogue in famous French films. It was all spontaneous, and would keep the tension away.’ Pyschologically, Mauresmo’s input was most keenly felt 12 months ago when Bartoli came through a rain-interrupted quarter-final against America’s Sloane Stephens. At one point, they were off court for two hours, Bartoli winning the key points when they resumed, one a 27-shot rally on her way to a 6-4 7-5 victory. ‘Amelie just kept me relaxed, assured me I was playing well, that if I kept the ball in play, I’d win,’ explains Bartoli. ‘Looking back, it was a big part of my success. Murray’s decision to have a woman in charge of his preparations will be one of the most-scrutinised stories of Wimbledon, particularly after his early exit at Queen’s. Australian player Marinko Matosevic spoke for the sceptics last week when he said: ‘For me, I couldn’t do it (appoint a female coach) since I don’t think that highly of the women’s game.’ Ladies in his life: Murray's girlfriend Kim Sears (right) shares a laugh with Murray's coach Mauresmo . It’s ironic that France is at the centre of a new era in sport when it’s not historically been regarded as a bastion of women’s liberation. French Ligue 2 football team Clermont Foot appointed a female coach, Helena Costa, as their manager in May – the highest-profile club ever to do so. Now, a Frenchwoman Mauresmo has been entrusted with Murray’s Wimbledon chances. ‘The message is extremely positive,’ says Bartoli. ‘I am very proud to be French at a time when our country is getting more women involved in sport.’ More modestly, Bartoli can’t say whether her own experiences with Mauresmo helped persuade Murray to appoint her, though it should be pointed out Bartoli is good friends with the player’s mother, Judy. While Murray will begin his Wimbledon defence a week on Monday, Bartoli will be a spectator, having decided to retire after winning her maiden Grand Slam. She has been invited into the Royal Box on Tuesday. ‘Last year was a happy time - an amazing feeling of fun,’ she recalls. Something she hopes Mauresmo can transmit to Murray this year.
