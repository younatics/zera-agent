"By . Jennifer Newton . This mischievous little fox couldn’t resist sneakily biting his sibling’s tail as they played together in the sun. The adorable images show the young cubs teasing each other as they roll around in the grass and chase after one another as they enjoyed the bright weather in Bakersfield, California. The pictures of the San Joaquin kit foxes were captured by physician and photographer Peter Pieslor after he spent hours observing the fox family. One of the foxes decides to nip at the tail of one of his siblings as they play around on the grass . Got it!: The mischievous fox can't resist grabbing his sibling's tail and then teasing them . The cubs came out to enjoy the early afternoon sunshine with one cub deciding to put his sibling in their place . The pictures of the San Joaquin kit foxes were captured by Peter Pieslor in Bakersfield, California . The 66-year-old from Thousand Oaks, California, said: ‘This family consisted of a mother, father, and their litter of six adorable fox pups. ‘In these photos, the pups were around one to two months old and were social and mischievous. ‘These little foxes were chasing each other to ultimately snip at the tails of one another. The kit fox can be found in the states of Nevada, Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico as well as western Texas and south-eastern California . Mr Pieslor said the cubs were around one to two months old and were social and mischievous . The cubs take a rest after a tiring time of play-fighting and rolling on the grass . ‘I did wonder if this activity was related to a pecking order that was being established or whether it was practice to bring down prey, although, at their young age, this cheeky behavior would have been purely playful.’ The kit fox is a fox species of North America and can be found in the states of Nevada, Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico as well as western Texas and south-eastern California. Watching the cubs from just 30 feet away, Mr Pieslor was able to capture the photographs of them as they happily played together. The foxes displayed some very human behaviour by teasing each other, just like most brothers and sisters . The family of foxes consisted of a mother, a father and six adorable fox pups . Mr Pieslor was able to capture the photographs of the foxes from just 30 feet away . He added: ‘The cubs came out in the early afternoon for about an hour and a half, and then they returned to the den for several hours before playing again for around two hours. ‘I have had a very positive response from viewers, as people seem to love the playfulness of the pups, playing and teasing each other like all siblings do. ‘I felt pure amazement at being able to capture the whole family together; their antics were non-stop and unpredictable the whole time. ‘The behavior of the fox pups reminded me a lot of the types of things that you see from young children in a park - we aren't that different after all.’","Young fox pup was spotted biting his sibling's tail as they played together .

"By . Adam Duggan . New footage has emerged from last Friday’s violent clashes in the Ukrainian port city of Odessa, showing a man wearing medieval armour in a bid to protect himself in a violent riot. The pro-Russian protester could be seen dressed in knight’s armour and covering his neck in chain mail. Meanwhile, Ukranian nationalists on the other side of the protest were filmed gathering nearby rubble, throwing it to the ground so that it shattered into smaller pieces that could easily be thrown.

Smashing rubble to throw: Pro-Ukrainian nationalists are seen picking up smashed rubble to throw at pro-Russian separatists . The protesters could be seen smashing rubble, one man even using a pick to break it into smaller pieces. The smaller missiles were then hurled towards the pro-Russian separatists. The clash then became so violent that one man, wearing a balaclava and draped in a Ukrainian flag, yelled: ‘Calm down! Don’t touch the cops!’ Breaking up: A young female Ukrainian nationalist is seen throwing large pieces of rubble into smaller pieces to throw .

Crowds began to gather around the already packed ambulances, with ambulance officers unable to even let them into the vans. There was little medics could do beyond putting antiseptic ointment on the men's wounds and covering them with bandages. At one point a group of rioters took an injured protester to an ambulance – only to discover the ambulance was full of already injured men.

Against the backdrop of a more peaceful protest up the road, one woman pointed to teenagers and said: 'Have a look on what they’re doing.’ ‘They’re screaming filthy words while they haven’t achieved anything in their life.’ Many of the protesters at the more violent of the two protests appeared to be younger men, a lot of them dressed in football jerseys.

The protests were a precursor to the violent riot that erupted at Odessa’s Trade Union Hall, where 46 people died. Many were killed in a fire that erupted at the trade union building, after a pro-Ukraine march led to violent clashes on the nearby streets. In an attempt to boost confidence in the Kiev-based central government, an elite national guard unit were sent to patrol the streets. Odessa’s police chief was fired following the violent clash. The Ukrainian government also fired Odessa’s acting governor on Tuesday – replacing him with Ihor Palystya, a member of parliament.

Fiery clashes: Groups of rioters drive into a smokey haze, caused by Molotov cocktails being hurled by the opposing sides . Ukrainian authorities are blaming Moscow for the unrest that is gripping the nation’s east. The pro-Russians are calling for greater autonomy from Kiev’s central government, with some favouring separatism or even re-joining the Russian Federation. Anti-government movement leaders say they are planning to hold a referendum for eastern regions of Ukraine on Sunday. Russia and Ukraine met with European and U.S. leaders in Geneva on April 17, signing an agreement calling for the dissolution of Ukraine’s illegal military formations. Both Russia and Ukraine are now accusing each other of having broken the agreement, which has done little to quell the mounting conflict in eastern Ukraine.","Suited-up protester seen in footage from last Friday’s riot in Odessa .

"By . Leon Watson . Premier League's Chief Executive Richard Scudamore is reported to have sent a series of sexist emails . The boss of the Premier League has been forced to apologise after it was revealed he sent a series of crude sexist emails, in which he also mocked 'female irrationality'. Richard ­Scudamore, who likes to be seen as a champion of equality within the game, exchanged the messages with senior colleagues. They were revealed by the married 54-year-old's former PA, who received them automatically when she was working for the League last October, the Sunday Mirror reported. In one message, Scudamore mocked a former girlfriend saying he called her 'double decker' because she was 'happy for you to play upstairs, but her Dad got angry if you went below'. In another, the father-of-five told a lawyer friend who works on behalf of the Premier League to keep a woman colleague they nicknamed Edna 'off your shaft'. He also forwarded a 'male fairy tale' joke sent to him from a friend about a prince who was proposed to and said no, then lived happily ever after and 'banged skinny big t****d broads'. In one sleazy email exchange the lawyer . bragged to ­Scudamore: 'Have spent all day fending Edna off my graphite . shaft. She is terribly relentless isn't she?!' Scudamore, who has been chief of the Premier League since 1999, replied: 'Terribly! Must keep her off your shaft... graphite, sausage meat or flimsy . sponge.' Scudamore, who lives with his wife Catherine in a £1.8million home in Cirencester, Gloucestershire, has been at the forefront of promoting the growth of women's football and said the league strives to be at 'the leading edge' of the 'whole equality agenda'. Season finale: Scudamore in attendance at Manchester City's match against West Ham . Pensive: Scudamore looks to have things on his mind as he takes his seat at the Etihad . Richard Scudamore, Premier League chief executive, is a married father-of-five who lives in Cirencester, Gloucestershire . He will be at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday in anticipation of Manchester City winning the Premier League for the second time in three seasons. In a statement issued to MailOnline, he apologised saying sending the emails was an 'error of judgement'. He said: 'These were private emails exchanged between colleagues and friends of many years. 'They . were received from and sent to my private and confidential email . address, which a temporary employee who was with the organisation for . only a matter of weeks, should not have accessed and was under no . instruction to do so. 'Nonetheless . I accept the contents are inappropriate and apologise for any offence . caused, particularly to the former employee. It was an error of . judgement that I will not make again.' Scudamore, 54, has been chief executive of the Premier League since 1999 . In November Scudamore announced that the . Premier League and The Football League were joining forces with Sport England to provide new grassroots . women's and girls' football sessions for 14 to 25 year olds. He . said: 'The aim of this programme is to increase participation in women . and girls' football, and Premier League clubs are in a unique position . to do that. 'Not only . can they attract participants through the power of the badge, but . critically, they can deliver a quality coaching experience. Clubs will . be able to build on the success of Premier League 4 Sport, which was a . trailblazer for Sport England's satellite club strategy, to get more . individuals than ever playing our national game.' Richard Scudamore, chief executive of the Premier League, leaves FA Headquarters in 2007 . But following the exposure of his emails, campaigners for equality in sport have hit out at Scudamore. Kick It Out, the sport's equality and inclusion campaign sponsored by the Premier League, told the Sunday Mirror that ­Scudamore's behaviour was ­unacceptable. A spokesman said: 'Every employing organisation should have a disciplinary code covering staff conduct, and follow due process at all times when there is an allegation of sexist behaviour.' Shadow Equalities Minister Gloria de Piero told the paper: 'No one should use deeply offensive language like this. Football is a family game, with many women supporters, players and referees. It's time to kick sexism out of football.' Conservative MP Tracey Crouch, a ­qualified FA football coach and manager of a girls' youth team, suggested the language he used could damage the women's game. Ms Crouch said: 'It's disappointing at a time when he's trying to encourage more women to play football that he is using derogatory terminology like this. 'It's a difficult environment for a woman to be involved in, either as a player or an official, and, while most people have thick skins, it's important that somebody who is promoting the women's game shouldn't be using this sort of language.'","Scudamore likes to be seen as a champion of equality in football .

"By . Brendan Carlin . A UKIP activist who called for all immigrants to be sent home is set to fight a key Commons seat for Nigel Farage’s party. The party is poised to name controversial Lincolnshire councillor Victoria Ayling as its parliamentary candidate for Great Grimsby, which is narrowly held by Labour. The move comes after The Mail on Sunday revealed how former Tory Mrs Ayling had been caught on camera calling for all immigrants to be repatriated, saying: ‘I just want to send the lot back.’ Scroll down for video . The Mail on Sunday exposed how Victoria Ayling, left, said on video that she 'wanted to send the lot [foreigners] back', photographed beside UKIP leader Nigel Farage . Her former husband has also claimed that she was once a member of the far-Right National Front, but she has denied the allegation. Last night, Labour said Mrs Ayling’s selection would completely undermine Mr Farage’s boast  last week that ethnic minority  voters would be flocking to support his party. Labour MP Ronnie Campbell said: ‘Moves like this make a mockery of Nigel Farage trying to appeal to the ethnic minorities. ‘UKIP people say one thing but do another. It’s hypocrisy.’ Last December,  this paper exposed how Mrs Ayling,  described by a party insider as a ‘Farage filly’ for the way she was fast-tracked after defecting from the Tories. She made the inflammatory comments on immigration after leaving the Conservative Party. In a 20-minute video filmed in 2008, she talked about restricting  the number of foreigners coming in  to the country, before saying: ‘I just want to send the lot back but I can’t say that.’ Nigel Farage, pictured, held an election rally in London featuring black and asian supporters . She added: ‘We must basically repatriate those that shouldn’t be here.’ At the time, Mrs Ayling, 54, claimed that her remarks had been taken ‘out of context’. Now she is poised to be named as UKIP’s candidate for the marginal Labour seat of Great Grimsby – which she fought at the 2010 election as a Tory. Four years ago, she came within 714 votes of a shock victory against Labour veteran Austin Mitchell, who is standing down next year. Mrs Ayling was unavailable for comment last night. However, earlier this year, she spoke . openly about her ambitions to become an MP and denied any suggestion of . racism in her remarks on immigration. UKIP . has been beset by a series of embarrassing claims by party members in . recent weeks, including one who said comedian Lenny Henry should . emigrate ‘to a black country’. But last week . Mr Farage used a rally in London with black and Asian party candidates to deny claims  his party harboured racism. In . a separate development yesterday, UKIP switched tactics by launching a . poster campaign to win blue-collar votes from Labour ahead of next . week’s European elections. The anti-Brussels party sought to mimic Ed Miliband’s ‘cost of living’ campaign by claiming EU membership put an extra £400 on UK household food bills. The campaign, funded by Eurosceptic millionaire Paul Sykes, came amid UKIP claims that it would now squeeze the ‘soft’ Labour vote in the same way it has attracted former Tory supporters. A party spokesman said the decision to switch the attack on to Labour was taken by Mr Farage and key aides at a strategy meeting last week. The move was based on research showing that given the party had already ‘eaten deep’ into the Tory vote, traditional Labour supporters represented the ‘biggest, softest’ section of voters left to be squeezed in the final ten days of the European campaign. Mr Farage said: ‘Despite these being European elections, Labour and Ed Miliband do not want to talk about Europe. They have nothing to say apart from the fact that they won’t trust the people to decide if they wish to be governed from Westminster or from Brussels.’","Mail on Sunday revealed UKIP candidate calling for all immigrants to be sent home .

"By . Judith Woods . and Dan Bloom . A millionaire lawyer dubbed the Diva of Divorce is drawing up one of the most important pre-nups of her career - her own. Ayesha Vardag represents tycoons and royalty and was a key player behind a 2010 ruling which made all pre-nuptial agreements binding in British courts. Now the mother-of-three is planning her own lavish wedding to her fiancé, the astrophysicist turned finance guru and fellow millionaire Stephen Bence. Flamboyant but cautious: Ayesha Vardag with her fiancé Stephen Bence in her office. The pair will wed in a plush Westminster Cathedral ceremony next month - and have drawn up a pre-nup agreement . True to form, their opulent, romantic ceremony in Westminster Cathedral next month will be preceded by something far drier - a complex legal agreement. She told The Mail on Sunday's You magazine: 'Stephen and I are both multimillionaires in our own right. 'We know what is fair and we didn’t want to be subject to the whims of the court. 'I will be giving him an interest in my firm and he has already facilitated for me to have an interest in his firm, which is how we are reflecting our connectedness to each other's working lives.' Ms Vardag, a flamboyant character who drives a red 1984 Mercedes convertible, lives with Mr Bence and their five children from previous relationships in central London. They have been portrayed as a perfect . picture of romance - and she even has a £20,000 Harry Winston peridot . and diamond engagement ring to prove it. Power: Ayesha Vardag holding the agreement with her husband-to-be next to her classic red Mercedes . But the lawyer is no stranger to marriage break-up in her own life. Her sons Jasper, 18, and Felix, 17, . are from her first marriage, while nine-year-old daughter Helena is from . a subsequent relationship. Mr Bence, meanwhile, is the father of ten-year-old Edward and Susanna, eight, both also from life before his current fiancée. Influential: Ms Vardag, right, leaving the Supreme Court with heiress Karin Radmacher . But the top lawyer's own experiences pale in insignificance compared to some of the clients she has represented. Ms Vardag worked on Michelle Young's seven-year battle with her estranged tycoon husband Scot, who she claimed had hundreds of millions of pounds stashed away in secret accounts. Ms Young - who wanted £300million - . branded a £20million settlement 'disgraceful' and vowed to keep fighting . in what was branded one of the bitterest battles in British history. The . lawyer has also been representing a former Miss Malaysia beauty queen . seeking Britain's biggest ever divorce payout of £500million. Pauline . Chai demanded the settlement from her husband of 44 years, the Laura . Ashley retail tycoon Khoo Kay Peng - one of the richest men in Malaysia. In March a judge criticised the vast amount the pair had already spent on legal fees, reportedly more than £1million. The amount Ms Chai is seeking is thought to have dropped as she now claims her husband's fortune is £440million. In 2010, meanwhile, Ms Vardag worked on a historic case that changed the law on prenuptial agreements. Heiress Katrin Radmacher won a ruling in the Supreme Court that the prenup . she drew up in Germany to protect her £100 million fortune from her French-born . husband was legally binding. The . process saw Lord Justice Thorpe call for a greater legal recognition of . the agreements, saying: 'In future cases broadly in line with the . present case on the facts, the judge should give due weight to the . marital property regime into which the parties freely entered.'

"By . David Kent . Cardiff owner Vincent Tan says he will consider changing the club's colours back from red to blue - if they can win promotion back to the Barclays Premier League. The Malaysian businessman was behind the controversial decision to dispense with tradition and change the Bluebirds' home kit to red, but appears now to be prepared to at least think about reverting back. Cardiff were relegated last weekend after a turbulent first season in the Premier League, with manager Malky Mackay dismissed in December and his successor Ole Gunnar Solskjaer unable to keep them up. Ups and downs: Cardiff owner Vincent Tan has had to watch the club get relegated from the Premier League . Tan has now said that should they bounce back to the top flight, he might be prepared to concede on the club's colours, having believed a change to red would make them more marketable overseas, especially in Asia. 'I would like to focus on getting back to the Premier League and after we are there I will definitely agree to sit down and find a solution - maybe we can have a compromise,' he told the BBC. 'I am not a quitter. I will stay until we get ourselves up and then we will see whether we can work out this colour change and compromise. If we can, maybe I will stay for a long time.' Red and dead: Cardiff's relegation was confirmed last weekend as they lost 3-0 at Newcastle . He added: 'Let us get back to the Premier League first and after we are there I assure fans, the Supporters' Trust and all of them, that I will sit down with them and we will find a solution that I hope will be satisfactory for all - for them and for me also. 'We would like to work closely with the fans. We will try to engage and meet as often as we can. 'Our chairman (Mehmet Dalman) will have constant dialogue and whenever I can I will join them.' Tan has also rejected his image as a 'villain' after reaching a settlement over the sacking of Mackay. Happier times: Tan with former owner Malky Mackay before he sacked the Scot earlier this season . The Scot and his former head of recruitment Iain Moody both released statements on Friday announcing that they had reached settlements with Cardiff and also issued apologies for any offence they may have caused to Tan. 'For legal reasons I cannot comment on the detail,' Tan said. 'But I'm pleased that finally we have a closure on this matter and suffice to say he is dropping all litigation, all claims against us. 'I'm pleased with the result and I'm also pleased that he has publicly apologised. I said before, one day some people will apologise to me for what they have done. 'Some people made me out like the villain. I'm supposed to be the Bond villain, but actually I'm James Bond.'

"By . Adam Lee Potter . and Nick Constable . The Berlin Wall came down almost 25 years ago. But in one leafy corner of Middle England, the Iron Curtain lives on. A 300ft-long fence, thrown up by millionaire farmer Alan Brunt to keep dog-walkers off his land, has led to a bitter showdown with locals who treasured their strolls across the wild meadow. Yesterday they gathered to make their first public protest at what they say is now a grim, metal corridor reminiscent of a Gulag prison boundary. The six foot high fence that has been erected along a field in Frome, Somerset. The fields known locally as the Rodden Lake Stream Meadow have been used by families . Opponents are demanding that Mr Brunt – who bought the field at Frome, Somerset, eight months ago – rethinks the height and appearance of his 6ft-high spiked fence. He says he is merely trying to protect and contain his stock, prevent dog fouling and keep scooter-riding youths from using it as a racetrack. However, it appears the former haulier and beef farmer woefully underestimated the thwarted fury of Middle England’s ramblers when he erected the fence over the Easter Bank holiday. Last autumn the meadow was bought at auction by local businessman Alan Brunt for £210,000 . The six foot high fence in Frome, Somerset allows a small corridor for ramblers to walk through . Wind turbines and solar panels are one thing. But obstructing the views of a muddy track said to have been used for three generations amounts to a declaration of war. As Scotland’s William Wallace almost said, they can take our lives but they will never take our footpaths. Owner: Alan Brunt (pictured) bought the meadow at auction for £210,000 last year . Ruth Knagg, who heads the opposition, has battled for months to persuade the 64-year-old farmer to lease the land – Rodden Lake Stream Meadows – back to the community. She and a host of fellow residents had previously raised £100,000 to buy it at auction, only to be blown away by Mr Brunt’s bid of £230,000. The 48-year-old charity fundraiser said: ‘People have been walking across these fields for 50 years. The local primary school used to come here on field trips, but no more. ‘I really don’t understand why he’s done this. He says he wants to grow hay and graze his beef cattle but why make it look like a Gulag? ‘If he really wants to keep dogs off, what’s wrong with a good old-fashioned barbed wire fence?’ Mr Brunt, who recently sold his haulage business, bought the 29-acre plot last September after the previous owner – who had happily allowed open access  – died. Mrs Knagg – who has walked here for 20 years – added: ‘We were all pleased when Mr Brunt bought the land because he was bidding against a property developer. ‘But, of course, now we all fear that he will one day develop this land. Why else spend a quarter of a million pounds on it? ‘The tragedy is that this was one of the last great, green spaces in the town – these fields were the green lungs of Frome and now they’re lost to us for ever. Mr Brunt won’t even talk to us any more and we are powerless – it’s so frustrating. ‘Mr Brunt told me he bought the land as a means of keeping his money safe after he sold his  haulage business. ‘We fear he may plan to develop the land at some point but, to be honest, it’s not that well suited to building houses on. ‘There are power lines overhead and the train track runs alongside. But it’s a lovely place, full of wild flowers, that we all hold dear.’ Dozens of locals yesterday braved torrential rain to picket the fence, including Dave and Briony Clark, their eight-year-old son Ted, and two-year-old labradoodle Ramsey. The couple have walked here every week for 13 years. Plumber Mr Clark, 53, said: ‘In the old days we’d probably have turned up with pitchforks – now our worst weapon is a dog whistle. Anger has erupted over metal fencing in Frome, Somerset installed across wildlife meadows that were at the centre of a public campaign last year to save them . ‘But if this chap didn’t think he was doing something wrong,  why put the fence up almost overnight, in secret? And this thing is just hideous. ‘No one in their right mind would think that open fields are the place for threatening metal spikes that belong in a military prison. ‘He has ruined this lovely place. And for what? A few bundles of hay and a dozen cows.’ Architect Terry Pinto, 48, added: ‘This is a beautiful landscape and the most alien thing you can imagine has utterly ruined it.’ Wine merchant Jason Yapp, 46, has also been walking here for 13 years. He said: ‘It’s a disgrace. The fence is an eyesore, a scar on the landscape that has no business here. ‘As well as putting up the fence, Mr Brunt has demolished a beautiful hedgerow. ‘The community is up in arms. We all need to protect our green, open spaces. There is absolutely no need for a high-security-style fence in open countryside. What next, razor wire? My children have played here happily all their lives. This man has destroyed a thing of beauty.’ Town clerk Paul Wynne, 50, said: ‘I went to see Mr Brunt when he first bought the fields to see if we could reach some arrangement. ‘We had managed to raise £100,000 so we thought we might be able at least to buy half of the land but he turned us down flat. I don’t know why he wants so much land – 29 acres is a huge area to graze cattle on and there’s no money in hay.’ Mr Brunt bought the land after Mendip District Council rejected a bid to protect the area by Mrs Knagg’s action group Save Open Spaces. The group attempted to register the open pasture as a community asset, which also failed. The group then asked Mr Brunt to keep the walkway clear but his response was to erect the fence, insisting walkers stick to the designated path. Mr Brunt claims he built the fence to protect his livestock from the risk of disease posed by dog faeces – and to protect dogs and walkers from his cattle. He told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I chose the design for health and safety reasons. If I’d used wood or wire, people would have just cut it or knocked it down. Then I would have animals wandering on to the road and railway line. The truth is that walkers have been trespassing on that land for years. If they had cared for it properly I might not have needed a fence like this. ‘But they allow their dogs to mess everywhere and me and my staff have to work in it. ‘I thought, “They don’t look after it, so I will.” I went to the footpath people and asked if I could put a fence up and they said it was my right, so I did. ‘We’ve also had people camping rough on there and taking on mopeds and scooters late at night. It has been horrendous for the local residents but we have now sorted the problem out.’ And one resident last night welcomed the fence. Jean Dredge, 80, whose garden abuts the entrance to the path, said Mr Brunt was a ‘saviour’ who had restored peace to the area. She said: ‘It’s been lovely to walk out of my door these past few weeks and not be confronted by piles of dog mess. ‘Neither are we woken up at 6am by people slamming their car  doors and shouting good morning to each other.’","Businessman Alan Brunt bought the 29-acre plot for £280,000 last year .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . David Batt pretended to be homeless to scrounge money off generous shoppers while actually living in a £230,000 house . A beggar who pretended to be homeless so he could scrounge money from shoppers actually lived in a £230,000 village home, a court has heard. David Batt, 34, would lay in doorways in Maidstone, Kent, pretending to be homeless so sympathetic shoppers would hand over their spare change. But the man actually lives in a two-storey semi detached property worth £230,000 in an attractive village, a court was told. Batt’s deceit was exposed when he appeared before Maidstone Magistrates' Court accused of begging for the third time in just nine months. He was caught with £19 in small change on King Street in the town last month. The man then gave his address as a housing association property in Yalding - which is around seven miles outside the town centre. Batt pleaded guilty to begging in court today and was fined £35. He was also ordered to pay £85 costs and a £20 victim surcharge. Batt, who was convicted for begging in . August and September last year, refused to comment on the latest . addition to his criminal record. Maidstone town centre manager Bill Moss said Batt was well known locally. He said: 'This man is a habitual nuisance to residents, customers and workers in the town centre. 'He has spent many months begging and received huge sums of money from local people. 'This man sees begging as an easy way of making money.' Mr. Moss added: 'The big disappointment is that the court has not dealt with him more seriously. 'A £35 fine will soon be afforded from money he will scrounge in a few short hours.' Batt's lies were exposed when he gave his address in court as this semi-detached property in Yalding - seven miles out of the town . Neighbour Brian McAuley, 49, today branded Batt a 'lazy git'. He said: 'I always see him around, cycling on his bicycle. He doesn't look like he needs to beg for money - he looks absolutely fine. 'He lives with his mum and she must be at her wit's end. 'I think he's a lazy git and he should get a job. There's plenty of work in the farms around here. 'But he's obviously made a lifestyle choice to sponge off other people.' Mike Fitzgerald, 76, the chairman of the Maidstone Day Centre for homeless people, said Batt was 'clearly a very good actor'. Batt would lie in doorways along King Street, Maidstone, pictured, to scrounge money off shoppers . He said: 'We are pleased that action has been taken against this man. It's a shame because people around here are very generous and this guy gives genuine homeless people a bad name. 'I've seen him begging before and I asked him why he wasn't going to the day centre. He claimed they didn't want him there, which I found strange. 'He was a very convincing homeless person because of the way he sat and acted. He's clearly a very good actor.' On his Facebook page, Batt boasts about a trip to the hairdressers, saying: 'Had ma hair dun 2day in im well chuft wiv it'. He is also pictured holding a rifle and riding a gleaming motorbike. The man has appeared in court three times in the last nine months for begging.

"By . Belinda Robinson . Tragic death: Kayaker Gareth Lockyer, 34, was found dead in the River Usk in Powys . An exhausted kayaker who drowned after becoming trapped underwater was overheard muttering ‘I’ve got nothing left,’ before he died his girlfriend told an inquest. Gareth Lockyer, 34, from Warwick was paddling along the swollen River Usk, near Brecon, South Wales when his kayak capsized, tipping him into the water. The Kayak-enthusiast had been enjoying a day out on the river in February with his girlfriend Emma North but became separated from the group he was with at Llangynidr, near Crickhowell, on Sunday lunchtime. The safety strap attached to his leg became snagged on the trunk of a fallen tree, dragging him under the surface. Rescuers found his body at 11.20 GMT the following day in the swollen waters of the River Usk. During an inquest into his death in Brecon, his distraught girlfriend told how Gareth struggled to free himself from the safety strap in the fast flowing river. She said: ‘I called to Gareth to keep swimming and Gareth got really close - then I heard him say 'I've got nothing left'.’ His family said he had never visited the Crickhowell section of the River Usk before, but was excited about going to Wales. Before his death, the 34-year-old University of Nottingham engineering graduate had been . warned about keeping the safety strap under his life jacket. But he had wanted to be able to grab it quickly to help others in trouble.

"By . Alexis Parr . The Marchioness of Worcester has turned Miss Marple after a valuable statue of a pig went missing at a society party – and was last seen in the company of a convicted fraudster. The £8,000 bronze was auctioned last month at a fundraiser for Tracy Worcester’s animal welfare charity, Pig Business, held at London nightclub, 41 Mayfair. It was bought by Matthew Unger Brown, who was last seen jumping into a taxi with it. Stymied: This £8,000 pig statue went missing after being auctioned to known conman Matthew Unger Brown who was seen getting in a cab with it, but now claims it has disappeared . But Unger Brown, 29, is a serial conman who, the Marchioness says, paid with an ‘uncashable’ cheque. Unger Brown, meanwhile, claims he hasn’t got the pig, saying he may have left it in the taxi. Now the Marchioness  – who starred in the 1980s TV detective series CATS Eyes –  has launched an investigation, searching CCTV footage to establish the truth. She said: ‘I’m giving him a month to sort it out – either return the pig or come up with the money.’ Tracy Worcester says Mr Brown paid with an 'uncashable' cheque and has now launched an investigation . A statement issued by Unger Brown’s lawyers said: ‘He categorically denies he behaved fraudulently’ and that he ‘lawfully purchased’ the pig. In 2004, he admitted deception charges after posing as an aristocrat to get a credit card, running up bills of thousands of pounds.","Pig statue sold in charity auction to Matthew Unger Brown last month .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Britain’s least used railway station recorded just eight passengers last year. The total for Teesside Airport station, is even lower than the previous year, when 14 people passed through it. There are just two trains a week, on Sundays – the minimum required by law to avoid closure. Not needed: Less than 10 passengers passed through Teesside Airport Station in 2013. There are just two trains a week - both of which arrive on a Sunday . So remote . and underused is the Teesside Airport station that even the local airport's website ignores it - despite it being less than a mile from the terminal. The . airport claims that: 'Darlington Train Station is the nearest train . station to Durham Tees Valley Airport, located just 7 miles away.' A Northern . spokesperson said: 'The parliamentary service which calls at Durham . Tees Valley Airport station is one which is specified in our franchise . agreement. 'The line . between Darlington and Middlesbrough has attracted a growing number of . passengers over recent years, however the Airport station on the route, . has not enjoyed the same success.' Forgotten: Just two trains stop at Teesside Airport station a week - the minimum required by law. Both of the trains are on a Sunday . 'We support proposals to relocate the station, as part of the wider Tees Valley Metro development, to better serve the needs of rail /air passengers,' the spokesperson added. 'We are already working with partners involved on initial stages of the scheme including the opening of a new station at The James Cook University Hospital and improvements at other stations on the route.' The station, which was opened in 1971, has two platforms. When the airport changed its name in 2004 to Durham Tees Valley Airport, the station's name remained the same. The neglect of so many of Britain's smaller stations underlines how many areas are under-served by the railway network despite having their own facilities for trains. It is easier for train operating countries to run 'zombie' services on lines they no longer wish to serve properly, as closing stations requires a lengthy consultation process.","Less than 10 passengers passed through Teesside Airport Station in 2013 .

"By . Dan Bloom . and Kieran Corcoran . He's the president who has ridden a horse topless, hugged a polar bear and 'found' (fake) Greek vases while scuba-diving. Now Vladimir Putin is at it again - playing ice hockey with sporting legends in front of thousands of apparently adoring fans. But the Russian premier, 61, was not without a little help - he missed several goals by a whisker, leaving his celebrity teammates to give the puck a gentle nudge in the right direction, before finally hitting home on his own. Scroll down for video . Sports star: Vladimir Putin triumphed in a game of ice hockey in Sochi . First attempt: The Russian president takes a shot at the goal (left) – but it bounces away. A team-mate to the left of the net (right), catches the rebounding puck and taps it into the goal. Putin is said to have scored five assists . Bold attempt: On his next attack (left), Putin flicks the puck towards the net… but he puck clatters against the crossbar of the goal (right) without going in . Deadly approach: Putin flies down the middle of the rink (left), and takes another shot at goal - and scores when the puck smashes into the back of the net (right) Sporting the number 11 jersey, Putin returned to the Winter Olympics host city of Sochi today for the All-Russia Festival of Night Hockey League. Joining the 'NHL Stars' team, the premier took a break from crisis talks with the West about his annexing of Crimea to play alongside retired former Soviet hockey legends, including Vyacheslav Fetisov and Pavel Bure. At least two of his team-mates were Olympic medal winners, including Aleksey Kasatonov, who won two golds for the Soviet Union in 1984 and 1988, and Valery Kamensky, who also took gold in 1988. His opponents, meanwhile, were reportedly amateurs. Even so, the 62-year-old premier's teammates were apparently eager to help him. In at least two attempts, Putin just missed the goal, but the puck went in after a gentle tap from another player. Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu and the head of Tatarstan Republic, Rustam Minnikhanov, were both at the festival for the league, which was created in December 2011. It began as a casual event for over-40s but has grown and this year was attended by 108 teams including from 11 other countries. Putin took part in a gala match between amateur hockey players in a successful games for the Russians - who topped the table ahead of Norway, Canada and the USA with 33 medals. Sadly for Putin, however, his side was knocked out by Finland at the quarter-final stage. But the upbeat president reportedly told the crowd: 'There . are no winners or losers here. This is a friendly game. 'It’s a show and . everyone enjoyed it. All this [the Night Hockey League] was invented to . give an additional boost to the development of sports and physical . culture.' Victorious: A proud-looking Putin bumps fists with his amateur rivals . Adoration: He was also seen shaking hands with ecstatic members of the crowd . According to state broadcaster The Voice of Russia, the President 'netted six goals and five assists'. The bold claims are, as yet, not fully confirmed. It is the latest in a long line of macho publicity stunts by the Russian president, who last took to the ice in January, shortly before the Winter Olympics in Sochi. On a horse: The Russian president was pictured in this macho pose while travelling the Siberian mountains in 2007 .

One more bizarre report last year suggested he was inviting the boy band Boyz II Men to a Moscow gig - to boost the country's birth rate. And in 2011, a spokesman was forced to admit that a scuba-diving exhibition in which he 'found' the remarkably intact remains of two 1,500-year-old Greek vases was staged. The remains, the spokesman said, had been found by archaeologists and placed there in advance.","Russian president took to the ice at All-Russia Festival of Night Hockey League in Sochi wearing number 11 shirt .

"By . Jennifer Newton . Federal police in Brazil are threatening to go on a nationwide strike during the World Cup in a row over pay and working conditions. Officers staged a protest rally yesterday outside the Rio de Janeiro concert hall where national team coach Luiz Felipe Scolari was announcing his squad for the tournament. They carried an inflatable white elephant to complain about the high costs that hosting the World Cup, set to begin on June 12, has brought to Brazil, which already has a struggling economy. Federal police protesting for better pay and working conditions while on strike in Rio de Janeiro . President of the federal police union, Andre Vaz de Mello said: ‘We gave all possible deadlines. ‘If we don't see a government response to change things, we will stop working during the World Cup.’ At Copacabana Beach, others on strike lined up footballs with red crosses on the sand, showing photos of victims who have been killed or injured in gunfights in the city's supposedly ‘pacified’ slums. Protests are also said to have taken place in Brasilia and Fortaleza among other cities. The latest 24 hour strike takes place just a month after federal troops were forced to restore order on the streets in the north-eastern state of Bahia, when police staged a walk out. This officer wears a skull mask and a T shirt which reads 'SOS Federal Police. Restructuring now!' Those on strike staged a rally at the same venue where Brazil's coach was announcing his squad for the tournament . The opening game of the 2014 tournament will take place in Sao Paulo, where impoverished Brazilians are living illegally on land near the stadium, blaming the arena's construction for rent increases that have drove them out of their homes. Approximately 5,000 people who invaded the private land say rising rents are a result of World Cup real-estate fever in the neighbourhood around the stadium. ‘We are not against the World Cup,’ insisted Rita de Cassia, a 35-year-old nurse who says her landlord doubled the rent on her one-bedroom house nearby, driving her family out of their home. The tents and shacks belonging to the Brazil Homeless Workers' Movement in Sao Paulo . ‘We are against how they are trying to belittle us. They are giving priority to soccer and forgetting about the families, about the Brazilian people.’ She joined the thousands of others in a group called the Homeless Workers Movement, which has been helping the families set up the tents. Robson Goncalves, one of the movement's leaders overseeing the occupation dubbed ‘The People's Cup,’ says he doesn't know who owns the land that measures about 37 acres (150,000 square metres). Approximately 5,000 people who invaded the private land say rising rents are a result of World Cup real estate fever . The city of Sao Paulo is said to have a housing deficit of 230,000 homes, with many waiting for a government funded property . He said it has been abandoned for two decades, and noted that no one has claimed it since the families began squatting on it last weekend. ‘Ever since they started building that stadium, property owners started overselling. This area is really becoming affordable only to the upper class,’ Mr Goncalves said. Sao Paulo mayor Fernando Haddad has told local media he's studying how to register the land so the families could move there legally.

"School children as young as four have been moved after it was feared rats had invaded classrooms. Forty reception pupils, aged four and five, had to be moved from St Joseph's Catholic Primary, in Wallasey, Merseyside, after reports of rodents. Three classrooms had to be closed after staff at the school suspected the pest problem on Tuesday, and informed Wirral Council. Kelly Cotton, (centre), was forced to keep her daughter Lexie, four, (right) home from St Joseph's Catholic School in Wallasey, Merseyside when she heard about the rat scare, pictured with her youngest daughter Isla, 18 months . Mother-of-two Kelly Cotton, 23, kept her five-year-old daughter Lexie off school because of the alleged rat problem. Ms Cotton, from Wallasey, said: 'The whole school needs cleaning inch by inch, not just the ones in question. 'Who’s to say they havnt spread across the whole site?' Forty children have had to be temporarily relocated from their classroom at St Joseph's Catholic Primary School in Wallasey, Merseyside after the rat scare . 'I’m not taking any chances they should be closing the school and having every single room treated. 'Me and plenty of other mums aren't sending our kids back until we’re satisfied it’s clean enough. 'Apparently they knew about the rats before Easter but they’re only doing something about it now. 'They had a terrible OFSTED report last term so this rat scandal will make them look even worse.' Ms Cotton said that her and 'plenty of other mothers' were keeping their children away from school until they were sure it had been properly cleaned . The 40 pupils have been relocated to a local nursery - while another 20 children affected will be moved to other classrooms in the school. Wirral Council said the headteacher and staff were making 'every effort to reduce disruption for the children'. Pest controllers deep cleaned the affected rooms and 'pest-proofing' measures had been put in place, it said. One parent said: 'My fear is that they could get bitten or catch something. 'I haven't had anything from the school, it's all just playground rumours. 'Some people are saying it's just droppings, others are saying they've seen rats.' Another parent said: 'The health and safety professionals have been in and cleaned up the whole area. 'They only found three juvenile rats, which I think have come in from a piece of grassland by the school.'It is expected youngsters relocated will not be able to return to their school until early next week.

Headteacher Kathryn Vernon said: 'We are working closely with Wirral Council after evidence of rodents was seen on school premises. 'We are unsure whether there is still a problem as no vermin have been seen since we reported the issue. 'Wirral Council Pest Control have up to this moment found no evidence of rats. However mouse droppings have been identified, so it is important that we investigate properly and act on any advice given. The situation is being kept under review.

A man with suspected mental health problems who is being sought by police after his mother was found stabbed to death could be armed with a murder weapon, officers fear. Detectives are warning the public not to approach Peter Holboll, 44, who is being sought following the death of his mother Tamara, 68, in Camden, north London, earlier today. Ms Holboll’s body was found in a burnt-out flat by firefighters who were called to a blaze in Lawford Road, Kentish Town, at around 5.15am. Detectives are now hunting her son Peter, who is believed to suffer a psychological illness, following her death. Detective Chief Inspector Russell Taylor, of the Metropolitan Police's Homicide and Major Crime Command, said he ‘could not exclude’ the possibility that Holboll was armed with a murder weapon. DCI Taylor said: ‘I need to locate him. I don't want people to approach him and put themselves at risk. ‘Mental health is one of the things we are looking into, we are engaging with our partners and agencies to build up as full a picture as we can for Peter. ‘We are very concerned for him and for the public.’ Firefighters were called to the blaze which broke out in a ground floor flat in the residential area, where houses sell for £1.5million, in the early hours of the morning. London Fire Brigade said three women, a man and a baby from separate flats on the first and second floors of the building were all rescued by crews after they managed to escape to the roof. DCI Taylor said firefighters then found the body of Ms Holboll, who had been stabbed, and alerted Metropolitan Police which sent officers and a force helicopter to the scene. He said: ‘It would appear that the victim had a number of knife wounds although we are awaiting the results of tests.’ He confirmed Peter Holboll had been staying at the address before the attack but did not give any indication if he had left sheltered accommodation. Tamara Holboll's body was found in a burnt-out flat by firefighters who were called to a blaze in Lawford Road, Kentish Town, at around 5.15am . He said: ‘The early indications are he is a local man and he frequents the local area, I have had nothing to suggest otherwise. ‘There were other people within the address who were brought out by the fire brigade. ‘It was fortunate that the fire was noticed at the point it did before it became truly established and they were able to get out.’ DCI Taylor said officers were looking at the history of the mother and son and what contact they had had with police in the run up to the murder. According to locals, an ambulance was seen at the house yesterday. A London Ambulance spokesperson said they had been called to ‘reports of a person unwell’ at 2.45pm and treated a man at the scene before taking him to hospital. However, the ambulance service could not confirm if the patient was Holboll. Police are investigating the circumstances surrounding the murder, as well as the cause of the fire, and have set up an incident room under DCI Taylor. The property has remained cordoned off for most of today . Police have launched a murder investigation after the body was found following a house fire in Lawford Road, Camden, this morning. Forensic experts have been working at the scene to collect evidence today, above . Holboll is described as a white unshaven male, between 5ft 10ins to 5ft 11ins tall, with lank black hair and wearing a green T-shirt and brown trousers. Police said that, if seen, he should not be approached and members of the public should dial 999 immediately. The incident has shocked neighbours in the street, who were awoken this morning by firefighters arriving at the scene and a police helicopter circling overhead. One neighbour said: ‘We’ve heard a woman who lived five doors away had been killed and then someone tried to set fire to the flat. ‘But she lived on the ground floor, there are two flats above her with a woman and a small baby trapped on the top floor.’ Another neighbour, who did not want to be named, described Holboll as ‘troubled’. They said: ‘We are worried he’s still in the area, the police helicopter came back around lunchtime and hovered around for a while. 'He might be lurking nearby and we now have a description of what he was wearing to look out for him. ‘He was a troubled guy, she had a lot of trouble with him. He had serious mental issues and they were due to visit the Crisis Centre nearby on Leighton Road. The incident has shocked neighbours in the street, who were awoken this morning by firefighters arriving and a police helicopter circling overhead. Forensics have been collecting evidence at the scene today, pictured . ‘He was living in some kind of sheltered accommodation near Tottenham Court Road but he’d always sit on the doorstep chain smoking one cigarette after another. ‘He would never say hello, and always looked unkempt with scruffy hair. ‘The police are here so hopefully we will be safe.’ Dr Zara Jay, a clinical psychologist who used to live above Ms Hoboll, said: ‘I heard from a neighbour that there had been an episode before I moved in in 2004. ‘An ambulance and police had been called to the flat, something had happened in there that had a mental health flavour to it, but I didn’t know if it was for him or for her. ‘He kept himself to himself, you would occasionally get a grunt from him in the corridor when you came and went and happened to bump into him. ‘He’d usually be smoking a cigarette on the doorstep. I never diagnosed him formally, but I have been told there were some issues there.’ Police are investigating the circumstances surrounding the murder, as well as the cause of the fire, and have set up an incident room under DCI Taylor. London Fire Brigade, which sent four fire engines, 21 firefighters and several officers to the scene, said it was working with the force to help investigate the blaze. London Fire Brigade, which sent four fire engines, 21 firefighters and several officers to the scene, above, said it was working with the Scotland Yard to help investigate the cause of the early morning blaze . A spokesman said: ‘The fire damaged the ground floor flat where sadly a woman inside was pronounced dead at the scene. ‘A man, three women and a baby from flats on the first and second floors were trapped on a flat roof at the back of the house because of the fire below. ‘The Brigade’s 999 control officers gave them fire survival guidance until crews arrived to bring them down to safety using a ladder. ‘One of the women was taken to hospital suffering from smoke inhalation. ‘The cause of the fire is under investigation by the Brigade’s fire investigation unit and the Metropolitan Police.’ Police said no arrests had been made in connection with the murder and said formal identification of the body had not yet been carried out. A post-mortem examination is scheduled to take place tomorrow. Anyone with information about the incident should call the incident Room on 0208 721 4868 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A grandmother has been hit with an £80 littering fine for feeding birds in a seaside town. Rose Rodell, 68, was given the fixed penalty notice while feeding peanuts to pigeons in Sidmouth, Devon. The pensioner started feeding the birds three years ago when she noticed two lost homing pigeons, and has not missed a day since. Rose Rodell, from Sidmouth, Devon, has been feeding peanuts to seagulls and pigeons in the resort for the last three years but was only handed a fixed penalty notice for her actions this week . Rose Rodell, 68, left, has been handed a fixed penalty notice for feeding birds in the town, right. East Devon District Council decided to take action following 'many calls' about her encouraging them to return to the area . She said she will now stop doing it but is refusing to pay the fine. ‘I’ve never been told not to feed them,’ she said. ‘I’ve always been advised about the birds but not told not to do it. 'The council knows I feed them, and a council officer watched me before pouncing and fining me for littering. ‘People who know me know I never litter, and I always sweep up. 'The lady who fined me was very abrupt. It saddened me to get the fine, because I’m worried the homing pigeons will suffer now.’ Sidmouth is one of three East Devon towns to employ a falconer to stop seagulls nesting in built-up areas . Rose Rodell said she would stop feeding the birds but would not pay the fine. The council said it had already warned her not to feed birds and said she was ‘well aware’ of the issues caused by seagulls in the town centre . East Devon Council has previously brought in falcons to rid the area of seagulls which have attacked residents. The authority said the gulls are attracted by food left for the pigeons. A . council spokesman added that they had spent ‘thousands’ on tackling . bird problems and their efforts were undermined if people fed them. The local authority said feeding the birds attracts vermin and seagulls to the area and said methods to dispel seagulls from the area were undermined by people like Mrs Rodell who continue to put food out for them .","Rose Rodell handed fixed penalty notice for feeding birds in seaside town .

"By . Steph Cockroft . A bride-to-be stole more than £500,000 from work to fund a secret online gambling habit - so she could live a lifestyle of luxury with her unwitting fiancé. Charlotte Darwen, 26, from Leigh, Greater Manchester, appeared to have it all with her two young children, a string of expensive holidays and a forthcoming wedding to her childhood sweetheart at a lavish Tudor country mansion. The mother-of-two also drove a new car, had put down a deposit on a house and regularly attended star-studded charity balls wearing designer clothes and jewellery. Charlotte Darwen, 26, from Leigh, Greater Manchester, has been jailed for three years after stealing more than £500,000 from her employer to fund a luxury lifestyle . Darwen (right) pictured arriving at Minshull Street Crown Court with her fiancé Harrison James (left), 26, where Darwen pleaded guilty to fraud by abuse of position after stealing the money to fund a gambling habit . But unbeknown to her friends, family and 26-year-old fiancé Harrison James, Darwen was propping up her extravagant lifestyle by fleecing her employers - and then secretly gambling the money away on online betting games. Darwen made more than 350 payments into her personal bank account worth more than £500,000 while working at motor claims firm Action 365 in Stockport, Greater Manchester, a court was told. At a hearing at Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester, the court heard how the stolen money was the equivalent to 12 staff wages at the family-run company, where Darwen started working in 2007 as an assistant to the finance director. The company has since had to lay off several staff and now has almost half the workforce, the court heard. The mother-of-two made more than 350 illegal payments into her bank account from company funds . Darwen, whose stealing was said to have had a 'devastating effect' on those who trusted her, was jailed for three years after pleading guilty to fraud by abuse of position. The court heard how Darwen had legitimately won £330,000 from betting sprees and had earned nearly £38,000 from her £15,000-a-year post. But she had secretly paid £508,120 from company funds into her account since 2011, by creating false invoices and credit notes. She had also blown nearly £420,000 on gambling sprees alone. The fraudster had also frittered away chunks of her winnings on luxuries, including a trip to Wembley and sports dinners and concerts where she got herself pictured with cyclist Sir Bradley Wiggins and singer Ronan Keating. She spent £5,000 on cosmetic surgery, £10,000 towards a car and a £48,000 deposit on a house, the court heard. And the mother-of-two also used the money to go on holiday in Majorca and Florida, posting photos from the lavish holidays on her Facebook page. The string of false transactions came to light in December 2013 during a company audit. Prosecutor Kim Irvine said Darwen was asked about the transactions, after it was discovered that 352 payments had been made into her account. She said: '(Darwen) said she was sorry and explained that she had a gambling habit and tended her resignation. 'She had even made a transfer whilst on maternity leave when she came into the company for a ‘keep in touch day’.' The fraudster, pictured here with her fiancé, used the money to fund a lavish lifestyle, including paying for a forthcoming wedding at a Tudor country mansion . She also went to star-studded events and concerts where she met celebrities such as singer Ronan Keating (left) and also frittered away the money on designer clothes and jewellery (right) Facebook photos also show Darwen enjoyed a string of luxury holidays, which were unknowingly paid for by Action 365, the firm in Stockport, Greater Manchester, where she was paid £15,000 per year to work as an assistant . Darwen’s total income from August 2010 to 2013 had been £823,618, the court heard. Miss Irvine said: 'Money was spent far beyond the defendant’s means. 'There were luxury holidays, £49,000 had been put down as a deposit on a house, £5,000 went on cosmetic surgery. Darwen was due to marry her childhood sweetheart in a lavish ceremony. The wedding has now been cancelled but the couple are still together, the court was told . 'There was an Apple computer, clothing, jewellery, a deposit for a lavish wedding, concerts and sporting events. £10,000 went towards a car. 'She told police she did have a gambling addiction and admitted stealing to support it.' In a statement Eleanor Lumsden, finance director at the company, said the thefts had left her 'absolutely devastated'. She said: 'Miss Darwen was someone I trusted and she had abused her position. The total loss of money was a testament to how devious she has been.' The court heard that the company could not keep staff in work and had to make a large number of redundancies which Mrs Lumsden said 'may not have had to' happen. She added that the fraud had affected 'a large number of people'. The company, which once employed 300 staff, now only employs 170. Darwen has since been attending Gamblers Anonymous. Her wedding to Mr James, whom she has been with since they were 19, has been cancelled but . the couple are still together. In mitigation, her counsel Edmund . Haygarth said: 'This is one of these cases where someone is relieved . that they were caught and rather regret they hadn’t been caught earlier. Darwen posted a series of photos on her Facebook profile, showing her lapping up the extravagant lifestyle - while the struggling company from which she stole was forced to lay off staff . 'She was trusted by people she regarded as friends and quickly regretted what she did. The judge told Darwen, who has since been receiving help for her gambling, that her actions had a 'devastating effect' on the people who trusted her . 'Her relationship with her long-standing boyfriend had its ups and downs and they were due to be married last month. The wedding was called off but they are now back together. 'Money was spent on luxuries most working people would not be able to afford so easily. She was also taking out payday loans - sometimes when she had a win she frittered the money away. 'This was not just sheer greed - she felt unable to control the urge to gamble. She said she feels worthless, she has let her family and boyfriend down and employers. 'She was friendly with some of the people who suffered because of her actions. She feels she has betrayed the good upbringing she was given.' Passing sentence Judge Maurice Greene told Darwen: 'You got involved in a spiral of gambling, stealing money then using it and getting into more debt. Both you and this company has suffered as a result. 'What you did has had an almost devastating effect on this company, members of the company, staff - people who trusted you.' After the case Detective Constable Andy Devonshire from Greater Manchester Police said: 'While many people have been tightening their belts just to make ends meet, Darwen fleeced her company to fund the kind of lifestyle she thought she was entitled to. 'She didn’t put in extra shifts or study for qualifications to pay for it - she just siphoned it off the very people who were paying her wages. 'She managed to buy a new house, enjoy holidays and even paid for cosmetic surgery. She has blamed her amassing of a small fortune on a gambling addiction. 'While it is true she spent a considerable amount on gambling websites, her addiction was by no means restricted to games of chance. She was also clearly addicted to what you might call retail therapy.' After the court case, neighbours living near to Darwen and her fiancé spoke of their shock. One elderly neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: 'It is such a shock about Charlotte - I had no idea what she had been doing. £420,000 on gambling sprees . £5,000 on cosmetic surgery . £10,000 on a new car . £48,000 on a house deposit . Thousands on designer clothes and jewellery . Thousands on a deposit for lavish wedding at Tudor manor house . 'I always used to take packages and parcels in for them when they were out. I did it all the time. They had big parcels from Next and Very. 'They always had parcels being dropped off although most of the time they didn't pick them up so I had to remind them. 'Soon I just stopped taking them because there wasn't enough room in my small porch. 'I did notice that her car did change a while back and she got a fancy bronze Nissan.' The neighbour added: 'She was the most unlikely woman to steal money on this scale. I know her wedding had been called off and that she said she had been staying at her father's. 'She had always been really happy and had lost loads of weight in anticipation for the wedding. 'She was just a happy lady, an unlikely lady to do something like that and Harry was really nice. I just feel terrible for the children.' Another neighbour said: ''All we saw was a woman wanting to play the perfect middle class wife. She seemed to have it all but it just shows how appearances can fool us all.'","Charlotte Darwen, 26, stole from work to fund her online gambling habit .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . A Tory MP claimed expenses for condolence cards to send to the families of dead constituents. Caroline Dinenage claimed £3.95 for a pack of three 'sympathy cards' new records published by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority reveal. The Gosport MP filed the expense claim under 'hospitality' and insisted the claim was fair. Tory MP Caroline Dinenage replaced Sir Peter Viggers - who was notorious for his duck island expenses claim - in the safe Conservative seat of Gosport . The 42-year-old backbencher insisted she did not need to pay for the cards because she sent them in 'her capacity as an MP', according to the Telegraph. Miss Dineage's spokesman said she sent the cards for 'consolation or condolence' when a 'formal letter wouldn’t be appropriate'. But the revelation sparked anger - with one MP suggesting that she did know the difference between work and ordinary manners. John Mann, the Labour MP for Bassetlaw, said: 'This is the old problem of people not differentiating what they should be doing personally and what they should be doing professionally.' Treasury Select Committee member John Mann has been a long-term critic of MPs abusing the expenses system. He attacked Miss Dinenage for forgetting the difference between what she should do professionally and what she should do anyway . He compared the scandal to the when MPs claimed expenses for Remembrance Sunday wreaths. In 2009, the Telegraph, revealed that Boris Johnson, Ed Balls and former Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy all claimed for the cost of a Remembrance wreath . A spokesman for Miss Dinenage told the Telegraph today that Miss Dinenage did not pay for the cards herself because they were sent in 'her capacity as an MP'. He added that they often contained other 'information or correspondence'. 'They are cards that are used for correspondence with constituents when a formal letter would not be appropriate – consolation or condolence,' he said. 'There needs to be something in Caroline’s capacity as an MP [for when] a formal letter wouldn’t be quite right. 'Over the past couple of years we have had constituents that have passed away – if someone has raised this with Caroline when Caroline is corresponding with them then when a formal letter wouldn’t be quite right it’s a card to send instead. 'It is sort of in her formal capacity as MP. It’s when something that needs to be done, it isn’t just a note of sympathy – it won’t just be a personal note. There will be something in her role as an MP, some information, some correspondence in there that isn’t the card.' Miss Dinenage succeeded Sir Peter Viggers as Gosport MP. He sparked controversy when he claimed £1,600 for a floating duck island. At the time she described surrounding expenses scandal as a 'nightmare'.","Gosport MP Caroline Dinenage put £3.95 pack of cards on expenses .

"By . Steph Cockroft . A husband who lashed out with an axe while angry at his wife has been spared jail - so the couple have the opportunity to reconcile their marriage. Axe-wielding Richard Naisbitt, 52, from Stockton, County Durham, missed hitting his wife by inches after telling her he planned to 'unleash hell'. Naisbitt had previously followed his wife to where she was staying, threatened to set the house on fire and told her he would see her 'in the afterlife', after she tried to end their 18-year marriage. Richard Naisbitt, 52, from Stockton, County Durham, was spared jail at Teesside Crown Court, above, after wielding an axe while he was angry at his wife . But Naisbitt was spared jail at Teesside Crown Court by a judge who thought there might be a chance of the pair making up. Recorder Mark McKone handed Naisbitt a suspended sentence, saying he did not want to 'prevent the marriage reconciling' by putting the defendant behind bars. He said Naisbitt - described as a law-abiding, hard-working man - had been punished enough from the four months he had spent in jail on remand for the crime. He told the defendant: 'What you did was out . of control and unpredictable and your wife must really have feared for . her own life. She must have been terrified. 'I’m satisfied the suspended sentence order will make sure there’s no re-offending. 'Clearly I don’t want to prevent the marriage reconciling if that is at all possible.' Naisbitt, who had six previous offences including an assault, admitted affray against his wife. The court heard the incident took place after his wife had tried to end the couple's relationship. But her husband refused to take no for an answer. He threatened his wife and followed her to the family member's home where she was staying. The former bricklayer told her he would see her 'in the afterlife', before driving off saying 'you'll be sorry'. Then, on January 18, his wife returned to their marital home with a friend to pick up her pets. Prosecutor Rachel Masters said the defendant armed himself with an axe and a screwdriver and started shouting at his wife. The court heard he shouted: 'I’m going to get all of you one by one.' 'Clearly I don't want to prevent the marriage reconciling if that is at all possible,' Recorder Mark McKone . He then threatened: 'I’m going to unleash hell. Lock me up if you like. I don’t care. I’ll just hit the gym and get big and get the lot of you', the court was told. Naisbitt then hit the axe into a . door frame, missing his wife by inches. In court, the victim made it clear her husband was . not trying to hit her. She said her husband had never hit her, but his drinking made him aggressive. Naisbitt told police he had little memory of what happened because he was drunk. The court heard he had been sectioned in 2008 for depression and had not been taking his medication for two years. Defence barrister Paul Newcombe said Naisbitt was in a very emotional state. He said the man did not consider himself to have a drinking problem but he hit the bottle when he had problems, which led to 'mayhem'. The court heard Naisbitt had been remanded in custody for four months since the incident. He had not seen his wife in that time. Mr Newcombe said: 'He doesn’t know whether it’s over.' Recorder McKone gave Naisbitt an eight-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, with a one-year supervision order. He warned the defendant not to knock on his wife’s door, but did not impose a restraining order.","Richard Naisbitt, 52, from Stockton, swung an axe while angry at his wife .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Lib Dem minister Jenny Willott said she avoids going to Prime Minister's Questions whenever she can . Lib Dem women's minister Jenny Willott today launched a stinging attack on Parliament and her own party for being too male-dominated and excluding women. She declared she hates Prime Minister's Questions with a 'total passion' and warned the 'horrifically long' hours make it difficult to be a mother on British politics. The Business Minister, who attends Cabinet on women's issues. also lifted the lid on the 'massive rows' she has had with senior Lib Dems about the failure elect more female MPs. Commons Speaker John Bercow sparked controversy last month after claiming that women MPs have stopped attending Prime Minister’s Questions because of the rowdy atmosphere. Today Miss Willott said she backed Mr Bercow, and tries to avoid the weekly clash whenever possible. She said: 'I think ultimately we do need to change the culture of this place, because... this is not an attractive job prospect if you are looking at it from the outside. 'The hours are horrifically long, you get shedloads of abuse, you're dealing with the Chamber where if you watch PMQs - and I know the Speaker got a lot of criticism for saying women walk out and don’t enjoy participating. 'I hate PMQs with a total passion. I only sit in there if I absolutely have to. I absolutely hate it and it says an awful lot about the way the House operates that it is seems from the outside, not a particularly attractive prospect to go in.' Miss Willott was speaking at the launch of the Asda Mumdex, which examined the views of 11,000 mothers who shop at the supermarket with a year until the general election. It found half of mothers think a female MP would do a better job of representing their needs than a male MP, and 72 per cent think policies are focussed on men. Miss Willott condemned the lack of women in politics, and singled out the Lib Dems for criticism. She added: 'We need more women in politics. The number of MPs in parliament who are women is absolutely shocking. It’s massively male. And the number of those of us who have small kids is even smaller.' She said she first stood for Parliament in 2001 and was 'very taken aback at how few women there were standing in seats that were winnable'. 'I have been having massive rows with my colleagues in the Liberal Democrats ever since about the need to do about getting more women standing for the party. 'There’s a massive lack of women standing and putting themselves forward and getting elected, to be honest in all parties. 'Labour has done much better than either the Liberal Democrats or the Conservatives, but still there’s a need for more women.' Miss Willott said she hates Prime Minister's Questions with a 'passion' and revealed she has had rows with senior Lib Dems about the lack of women in the party . Commons Speaker John Bercow claimed last month that women MPs were avoiding the weekly clashes between Ed Miliband (left) and David Cameron . Labour has 86 female MPs compared to 169 men, while the Tories have 48 women and 256 male MPs. The Lib Dems have just seven female MPs out of a total of 57 and Nick Clegg has been criticised for having more men with knighthoods on his benches than women. In an interview last month Mr Bercow said the culture in Parliament, particularly at PMQs, means many women are put off by the ‘histrionics and cacophony of noise’. Mr Bercow suggested that ‘seasoned parliamentarians’ boycotted the frequently boisterous sessions out of embarrassment, while other women did not want to take part in the session because it was ‘so bad’. He said: ‘I think it is a big deal. I think it is a real problem. A number of seasoned parliamentarians, who are not shrinking violets, not delicate creatures at all, are saying, “This is so bad that I am not going to take part, I am not going to come along, I feel embarrassed by it. ‘People with a lot to contribute are reluctant to engage because they think that the histrionics and cacophony of noise are so damaging as to cause them to look elsewhere. 'But I’m sorry if some of those people are lost to the chamber because they think, “I’m not going to take part in that atmosphere”.’ However, Tory defence minister Anna Soubry, who sits on the back row of the green benches among the ‘awkward squad’ of MPs, warned that Mr Bercow was perpetuating ‘old fashioned’ views of women by singling them out.","Business minister reveals she avoids clashes between party leaders .

Mr Balls, who now faces the threat of losing his licence, bumped into another car when trying to turn his car round 'in a tight spot' in his constituency. Ed Balls attempted to perform a 'seven point turn' in this street, but crashed into another car . Shadow chancellor Ed Balls has a long record of motoring offences - including speeding, talking on a mobile and, now, failing to stop after a bump . Last month's bump was the fourth time in recent years that Mr Balls has landed himself in trouble behind the wheel. In 2013, he received three points for driving through a red light on the Embankment near Westminster in London. The same year he was caught speeding in his constituency in West Yorkshire. He was clocked driving at 56mph in a 50mph zone. Mr Balls paid a . fine and attended a speed awareness course rather than accept penalty . points. And in 2010, the Labour heavyweight admitted 'stupidity' after being caught talking on his mobile phone while driving. As . a cabinet minister at the time, he was fined £60 and given three points . on his licence - although these points have now expired. But instead of alerting the owner of the damaged black Peugeot 306, Mr Balls drove off. He said that he had no idea he had caused any damage. Pictures at the time showed Mr Balls’ ageing Ford Mondeo estate clearly showing scratch marks on the bumper, but his spokesman insisted they were the result of police taking a paint sample from the vehicle. At the time West Yorkshire Police confirmed officers were making inquiries into a ‘fail to stop collision’ on Saturday, April 5. ‘Damage was caused to the front offside wing of a parked black Peugeot 306. Enquiries are continuing,’ a spokesman said. The Peugeot’s 32-year-old owner Dan Rowley – who has never voted – said he did not realise there was damage until the following day. Mr Balls said he only found out that he had damaged the other motor when he was contacted by officers a week later. Mr Balls today claimed the police had no choice but to charge him and insisted he accepted it fully. He revealed that he would be getting points on his licence as a result. A spokesman told MailOnline that he could receive between five and 10 points. On his blog today the Shadow Chancellor wrote: 'I’d been turning our car round in a tight spot in the narrow private drive beside the Labour rooms in Morley where I park all the time. 'Another car was parked close by and I was aware the two bumpers touched. But I had no idea any damage had been done until the police got in touch a week later. 'As soon as I was aware any damage had . been done I immediately took full responsibility for any damage caused. I’ve been in touch with the owner to apologise for the inconvenience . and to  pay for the repair to the marks on the parked car’s bodywork. Ed Balls is one of the most divisive politicians in Westminster. David Cameron regularly picks him out during Prime Minister's Questions . 'The . police have to do their job. Once I’d confirmed I knew the bumpers had . touched, their standard approach is to proceed to charge as they expect . people to stop and check. 'I . fully understand and accept that, so of course I will be accepting the . charge. While I had no knowledge at the time that any damage had . occurred, I accept their view that I should have checked. Getting points . on my licence will be a blow – but that’s the way it works.' The scrape was caught on CCTV camera and Balls's registration number was traced after the Peugeot's driver spotted some damage the following day. Mr Balls revealed last month that he had been issued with a 'notice of intention to prosecute' by the police over the 'fail-to-stop collision'. The offence could land Mr Balls with a fine of up to £5,000. In the most serious cases, offenders can be hit with a jail sentence of up to six months. Last month Sergeant Adrian Wright, of West Yorkshire police, said: 'We received a report on Sunday 6 April of a fail-to-stop collision on Commercial Street, Morley, which is reported to have happened the day before on Saturday 5 April. 'Damage was caused to the front offside wing of a parked black Peugeot 306. Inquiries are ongoing.' Today a West Yorkshire Police spokesman insisted they were still consulting with prosecutors and no formal decision had been taken to proceed. Mr Balls could potentially have to appear before magistrates even if he admitted the offence. While he could be banned from driving it is unlikely as he currently only has three . penalty points on his licence. If he was stripped of his licence he faces a mammoth trip from his Yorkshire constituency. He would have to take the train from Morley to Leeds before changing for London. Once in the capital, around three hours later, he would have to take the tube to Westminster. During the week he could either catch a lift to work with his wife - the Labour MP Yvette Cooper - or get the bus to Monument from his home in Stoke Newington, north London. He would then have to change onto the District Line to Westminster.","Labour shadow chancellor reveals he will be prosecuted by police .

"By . Darren Boyle . Cycling legend Sir Chris Hoy has struck gold in the property market after selling his luxury home for almost £900,000. The six-times Olympic gold medallist used the grand barn conversion as a base for his training at the velodrome in Manchester. Sir Chris, 37, lived at the five-bedroomed property with his lawyer wife Sarra but they decided to sell up last year after he quit competitive cycling. Sir Chris, and his wife Sarra bought the five-bedroom barn conversion for £765,000 in 2009 . The six-time Olympic champion used the luxury property as a base while he was still training competitively in Manchester . Sir Chris Hoy and his wife Sarra made more than £100,000 profit on their Cheshire barn conversion which they have just sold for almost £900,000 . The couple bought the former farm building on the Mere Hall estate in Knutsford, Cheshire, for £765,000 in 2009. Property records show that it has now been sold to an Ian Fenton for £870,000 - giving the cyclist a £105,000 profit. It is thought Sir Chris, from Edinburgh, could be planning a permanent move back to Scotland but his representatives have refused to confirm this. The house, just a few hundred yards from a golf resort, includes a reception hall, and open plan drawing room, a dining room and sun room. It is decked out in wooden panels and also boasts five double bedrooms, three bathrooms, a study, a garage and professionally landscaped gardens. Among the features in the luxury property are this amazing state-of-the-art kitchen . It also features an amazing open plan living area and plenty of natural light from the massive windows . Sir Chris had previously announced that he would like to return to Scotland after he finished cycling competitively describing Edinburgh as his 'home' At the time the property was put on the market last November, estate agent Stuart Rushton said: 'It is a very nice house in a much sought after area. 'The house was part of a group of farm buildings which were sold off around 10 years ago and converted into a small development of houses. 'The property is in a leafy suburb and is within good commuting distance of Manchester, it’s very popular. 'The property itself is very well presented and has been finished to a very high specification.” Speaking last year, Hoy told how his heart was still in his home city despite living down south for more than a decade. He said: 'Home is Edinburgh, even though I’ve been living in Manchester for 15 years. 'I’ll be back in Edinburgh for the festival this summer because I like stand-up. 'We would love to come back to Scotland eventually. 'The fact I’m no longer training full-time and based in the velodrome means we’re a bit more flexible.' Sir Chris said since retiring from competitive cycling, 'it was nice to spend some time with Sarra', left . He added: 'It’s just nice to spend time with Sarra, put her first as opposed to cycling for a change. 'It’s a luxury to be able to dedicate yourself wholly to one another.' Sir Chris won his first Olympic medal in Sydney in 2000 when Team GB finished second in the team sprint. He claimed his first gold four years later in the kilometre time trial in Athens. At the 2008 Games in Beijing, he won three golds in the team sprint, keirin and individual sprint. He was named BBC Sports Personality of the Year in 2008 and was awarded a knighthood in the Queen’s New Year honours list. Sir Chris won two more golds at London 2012 to overtake Sir Steve Redgrave as the Briton with the most gold medals . A spokesman for Sir Chris declined to comment.","The cycling champion bought the house in  Cheshire for £800,000 in 2009 because it was close to his training base .
The five-bedroomed property is just a short stroll from the local golf club and is on the Mere Hall Estate in Knutsford .
The gold medalist made a £100,000 profit from his four year investment after retiring from competitive cycling .
It is now thought Sir Chris may return to Scotland with his wife Sarra after expressing a desire to return to Edinburgh ."
"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Time-pressed parents on the school run who have dodged traffic wardens, puddles and the disparaging looks of other mums face a new obstacle at the schoolgate: rosette-wearing Labour candidates. Ed Miliband’s party has urged wannabe MPs to target mothers outside schools in a bid to woo swing voters ahead of the general election. Senior figures believe face-to-face chats whiling dropping off or picking up children are more effective than relying on more modern techniques like Facebook and Twitter. Labour leader Ed Miliband, pictured at Ravensthorpe Community Centre in Kirklees, believes he can win the election through door-to-door campaigning . Labour enjoyed a strong lead over the Tories among women for the early years of the coalition, but in recent months the gap has narrowed. David Cameron’s so-called ‘women problem’ was exposed by a study last year which showed female voters had turned against the Tories for being out of touch and too posh. The cash-strapped Labour party now admits it cannot compete with the multi-million spending of the Tory party, and instead will seek to focus on grassroots campaigning. In particular, this will include sending candidates and activists to woo mothers outside schools. Yvette Cooper, Labour’s shadow women’s minister, said the tactic could prove more effective than the rush to campaign online. It comes as Labour's latest web attack ad on VAT rises backfired, because most food is excluded. Shadow women's minister Yvette Cooper said most political parties are not good at using social media . Speaking at an event on women in politics, she said: ‘I think social media is really important, and political parties aren’t great at it and are learning. ‘It means not just Facebook, it’s also about standing at the schoolgate and talking to mums as well. ‘I just wouldn’t underestimate face-to-face contact. We are just trying to go and stand at the schoolgate and you see a lot of people going by, a lot of people in a hurry but there are also people who just want to talk about  something that they are worried about. ‘Politicians should always go to where people  are, rather than expecting people to come to where politics is.’ Labour's lead has been cut to just one point in the latest YouGov poll for The Sun, putting Mr Miliband's party on 35 per cent and the Tories on 34 per cent. Among women, Labour is ahead on 37 per cent with the Tories on 33 per cent. But among men, the Tories are ahead on 35 per cent to 34 for Labour. Miss Cooper was speaking at the launch of the latest Asda Mumdex survey of 11,000 mothers who shop at the supermarket. It found just one in 10 mums think politicians have their best interests at heart. But in boost for Mr Miliband, it showed 65 per cent of mums want action to impose limits on energy prices. Labour's new attack on the Coalition accused Nick Clegg and David Cameron of acting together to hike the cost of the weekly shop. But most of a family's everyday food bill is VAT free . Labour has promised to freeze bills for two years if it wins the election in May 2015. A Labour party spokesman said: ‘We do have a strong ground operation in each of our target seats. It is people out and about talking to the public, trying to explain face-to-face. ‘While the Conservatives might outspend us, we can out-campaign them. That level of door-to-door, street-to-street talking takes place day-in-day-out. ‘We will talk to mums and dads face-to-face wherever we find them, be it in the workplace, in shopping centres, be it at the schoolgate.’","Party claims face-to-face campaigning is more effective than Facebook .

Some Chinese believe sheep are meek and babies born in that year will grow up to be followers rather than leaders. According to superstition, the children are destined for heartbreak and failed marriages. Chinese couples are in a race against time to have a child in the Year of the Horse instead of 2015's 'dreaded' Year of the Sheep. The Lunear New Year this year, which was celebrated in January, above, marks the Year of the Horse . Like all animals in the Chinese zodiac, the horse sign comes imbued with characteristics, such as vitality, loyalty and adventure. The year of the horse is generally considered an auspicious time. Health professionals say many patients have inquired about early delivery via Caesarean section to ensure a horse-year birth. It has also been noted that fertility consultations have spiked in recent months. The Year of the Sheep begins on February 19, 2015, so the window for conception closes around the end of this month. Some people in China believe sheep are meek and babies born in that year will grow up to be followers rather than leaders. Many couples are desperate to conceive in 2014 - the Year of the Horse - and thousands around the world celebrated the Chinese New Year earlier this year, above .","Many couples believe Year of the Horse brings luck to those born during it .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A man stabbed his neighbour in a fight over a Barbie doll. Father of three Murat Ahmet lashed out after his daughter was accused of stealing the toy. Ahmet, 35, stabbed his 39-year-old neighbour in Braunau, Austria, leaving him in need of hospital treatment. He claimed: 'I wanted to protect my family'. Dispute: The stabbing took place after one man's daughter was accused of stealing the doll (file photo) The incident occurred when Ahmet and family returned home from a friend's wedding. When they returned a child was waiting by the driveway for them to return. The child asked Ahmet's daughter whether she had seen her missing Barbie, and the girl replied that she hadn't. A short while later both sets of parents came outside, prompting the two families to argue. Both went back inside their homes, but Ahmet went back to knock on the other family's door. He claimed it was outrageous that his daughter was accused of stealing, and after the argument escalated he was stabbed. A spokesman for the Upper Austrian Police said: 'We are investigating and he faces serious GBH charges. It could have been a lot worse if the stab wounds had been elsewhere.' The neighbour was hospitalised but has since been released and is expected to make a full recovery.","Murat Ahmet stabbed his 39-year-old neighbour in Braunau, Austria .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . Up to 49 per cent of British travellers who have never visited France think it is excessively expensive, according to a survey by Post Office Travel Money . British travellers appear to have made their minds up about France - even if they have never been across the Channel. Up to 49 per cent of people who have never visited the country feel it is excessively expensive, according to a survey by Post Office Travel Money. And of those who have been to France, only half believe it represents good value for money. The survey was carried out on 2,085 UK adults who had holidayed in a range of destinations across the globe. Turkey was found to be the best value-for-money destination - followed by mainland Spain, Greece and Portugal. Based on perception rather than actual visits, Bulgaria was seen to offer the best value - with Turkey, mainland Spain and Croatia also considered reasonably priced. But Dubai was ranked bottom of the list, with only 38 per cent of British travellers deeming it a good value-for-money destination. In terms of the destination to which most people would return, Turkey was voted top. Around two-thirds of travellers who had visited the country before declared they would go back. And 63 per cent of the people surveyed said they would return to mainland Spain. But - on a value-for-money basis - only 29 per cent would go back to Dubai, a third would return to France and just 40 per cent would make another trip to Italy, the survey found. Turkey was found to be the best value-for-money destination, while Dubai was ranked bottom of the list based on perception rather than actual visits. Above, the Burj Al Arab Hotel in Dubai (left) and Antalya in Turkey (right) Researchers also discovered that despite setting aside an average of £552 in spending money, most travellers go over their budget by around £242. Andrew Brown, of Post Office Travel Money, said: 'Our new research shows the extent to which value is a determining factor in destination choice. 'Holidaymakers can best arm themselves with information that will help them to make informed decisions about value by monitoring exchange rates to see where sterling has strengthened most this year.'","Up to 49% of people who have never visited France think it is too pricey .

"By . Associated Press . GM food must carry a label, politicians in the American state of Vermont have decided. It is the first US state to make labelling a legal requirement. The legislation, which is to come into force in 2016, was welcomed as a ‘momentous decision’ by campaigners concerned about the health and environmental impacts of ‘Frankenfood’. Several other US states are now considering following Vermont’s lead. From mid-2016, Vermont will require all food that has been genetically modified to be clearly labelled . The Vermont law takes effect in mid-2016, but opponents said shortly after the bill signing that they would file a lawsuit. The Grocery Manufacturers' Association said government has no compelling interest in warning consumers about GMO foods. Another obstacle to the state law looms in Congress as Republicans work on a bill that would forbid states from passing and enforcing laws requiring GMO labeling. Critics of GMO foods consider them environmentally suspect and a possible health threat. But many in the food industry say the food is safe, the technology boosts food production, and its use is less environmentally harmful than traditional farming methods. In signing the legislation, Shumlin asked for support Internet-wide, announcing the launch of a new website to help the state raise funds toward a court battle with agribusiness or biotech industries. 'We are asking people all across America, and all across the great state of Vermont, to go to (the website) and make a donation, so that we can win the Vermont food fight fund fight not only for Vermont, but for America,' Shumlin said. Meanwhile, the Biotechnology Industry Organization said in a statement that scientists and regulators worldwide recognize that foods made from genetically modified crops are safe. Industry insiders argue GM food are safe, and allow farmers to produce more crops on less land with less water . 'And these same GM crops have enabled farmers to produce more on less land with fewer pesticide applications, less water and reduced on-farm fuel use,' BIO Vice President Cathleen Enright said. In Congress, a House bill proposes voluntary labels on GMO foods. The bill would require the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to create the guidelines for the labels. About 300 people gathered on at the Statehouse to celebrate Vermont's decision to take on big industry. After speeches by state officials and others, there was live music and Vermont-made Ben & Jerry's ice cream. 'I'm so proud of the state I live in,' said 11-year-old Brigid Ambrust of West Hartford, who started a letter-writing campaign to persuade legislators to pass the law. 'I feel this is a wonderful step toward a healthier world and I'm so glad Vermont is the first to take it.' Maine and Connecticut have previously passed laws requiring labels on GMO foods, but their laws don't take effect unless neighboring states follow suit.","Vermont has become the first US state to require labelling on GM foods .

"By . Wills Robinson . Terrified tourists watched helplessly as a pride of deadly lions pounced on a buffalo. But during the vicious attack, the animal miraculously managed to escape. Eleven lions targeted and attacked the buffalo in Tanzania, while 12 safari vehicles full of astonished passengers surrounded them. Despite a relentless attempt by the predators to wrestle it to the ground, the buffalo was somehow able to break free from their grasps. Photographer Scott MacLeod first spotted the pride while they used the shade of the 4x4s as protection from the heat. However, the group were soon on the move when they caught sight of the herd. Describing the start of the attack, Mr MacLeod said: 'The lions roused themselves and moved on towards a herd of buffalo in the distance. Two of the strongest females padded stealthily towards their prey as a third lion circled around behind. 'The other lions waited, and watched. After a 20-minute standoff, the largest buffalo made a run for it and was soon caught'.

"By . Jenny Wood . Middle class shoppers are increasingly turning away from traditional supermarkets and embracing discount retailers such as Aldi, Lidl and even £1 shops in their efforts to bag a bargain. So it’s little wonder that Tesco, which has seen its market share fall to a ten-year low, is rolling out ‘pound zones’ in 300 stores to try to win back their custom. But how do Tesco’s £1 buys compare to Poundland’s? JENNY WOOD finds out... Jenny Wood attempts to find whether Tesco's £1 offerings are better than Poundland's . COTTON WOOL . Tesco: Johnson’s Baby, 75 cotton balls . You may not get that many cotton wool balls for your pound at Tesco; however, the supermarket’s offering is a big-name brand, and the quality shows. 5/5 . Poundland: Allura, 125 soft cotton wool balls . These feel a touch more synthetic and scratchy on my skin than Tesco’s offering. They are about half the size, too, meaning you end up using twice as many. 3/5RAZORS . Tesco: SuperMax Confidence 3 for Women (two-pack) With a comfortable curved handle and handy slip-on cover, these glide well over the skin, leave my legs nice and smooth and should last several uses. 4/5 . Poundland: EnergiFlex Triple Blade Power (four-pack) It’s a close call — or should that be shave? These work just as well as Tesco’s, but although there are twice as many, they’re slightly harsher on my skin. 3/5 . PARACETAMOL . TESCO: Panadol Original tablets (pack of 16) You’ll find this well-known brand in Tesco’s pound zone — and at a price that won’t give you a headache. 4/5 . Poundland: Galpharm Paracetamol capsules (pack of 16) These contain exactly the same amount (500mg) of paracetamol as Tesco’s, and the only difference is the packaging. 4/5 . Tesco has announced a new £1 range to put it in direct competition with Poundland . TISSUES . Tesco: Softy tissues (ten-pack) These decent tissues are as good as my usual buy, Kleenex, in terms of volume, size and thickness. Left my nose nice and soft, and at this price, not to be sniffed at. 5/5 . Poundland: Kleenex Original (ten travel packs) A big name brand and great quality — ideal for stashing in your handbag or pocket. There’s no need for me to pay £1.50 for a pack of six like I usually do. 5/5 . PREGNANCY TESTS . Tesco: 1st Aid pregnancy test (two-pack) With the average High Street chemist charging over £8 for a test, this is an incredible bargain and worked perfectly well for a pregnant friend who tested them for me. 5/5 . Poundland: FirstVue One-Step pregnancy test (two-pack) Slightly less basic than the Tesco version, and when tested by the same pregnant friend, this kit worked perfectly well, and quickly. Why spend more?  4/5 . WASHING-UP LIQUID . TESCO: Zingy washing-up liquid (1 litre) Not particularly thick or overly-bubbly, the large bottle looks great, but you’ll probably end up using more than if you’d forked out for a more expensive brand. 2/5 . POUNDLAND: Cussons Morning Fresh 675ml (2 for £1) This is a great deal — you end  up with 350ml more liquid than at Tesco, and it is a recognisable brand-name. Cut through the grease on my dishes a treat. 3/5 . But as our survey shows, for £1 bargains Poundland is still the best . FABRIC CONDITIONERS . TESCO: Comfort Pure (13 washes/455ml) Yet another big-name brand from Tesco, this is good quality stuff that gives great results. However, it’s a really teeny bottle. 3/5 . POUNDLAND: Cussons Morning Fresh Concentrate Fabric Conditioner (30 washes/1L) We could have bought the same brand as we did in Tesco, as well as this larger bottle from Cussons, which smelt similar and left my clothes feeling almost as soft. I usually use Comfort but would be tempted to switch. 4/5 . WASHING-UP BRUSH . Tesco: Bella Brush . This has good quality bristles and the sheer silliness of the design — it looks like a lady in a glamorous dress, whose short, spiky hair forms the bristles — should make you smile when you’re elbow-deep  in suds. 3/5 . Poundland: Starwash 2 washing-up brushes . The bargain retailer also sold Bella brushes, but these were a bit more effective, if not as exciting. The bristles are a slightly different shape, letting me get into the nooks and crannies of my dirty dishes more easily. 4/5 . STORAGE CONTAINERS . TESCO: Home Connection collapsible food storage container . Top marks for the innovative collapsible design, which folds up almost flat when not in use. Unlike the Poundland containers, it also clearly states that it’s safe to put in the microwave and freezer. 4/5 . POUNDLAND: Kitchen Corner food containers (five-pack) With a wide selection of tubs and containers, Poundland beat Tesco hands-down, yet the quality is a little basic, with slightly thinner plastic. At these prices though, who’s to quibble? 3/5 . PEELERS . TESCO: Home Connection comfort-grip peeler . A traditional shape with a chunky, easy-grip handle, this is nice and sharp, and made light work of my potatoes. I can’t believe I paid £10 for my John Lewis peeler when this is exactly the same! 4/5 . POUNDLAND: Kitchen Corner vegetable peeler . Available in several bright colours, with an almost identical handle, this comes with a protective blade cover for when it’s not in use. A nice touch, especially considering I have a toddler who likes nothing better than trying to get hold of sharp objects. 4/5 . BATTERIES . TESCO: Kodak AAA batteries (ten-pack) Going head-to-head with the same product, you get two fewer batteries at Tesco and only size AAA was available. 3/5 . POUNDLAND:  Kodak AAA batteries (12-pack) As well as a bigger packet, the discount store also sold other sizes, too, including popular AAs. More power to them, then. 4/5 . BIN BAGS . TESCO: Tuklok 20 refuse sacks . A bit thin and liable to tear, but are more than 15cm longer than Poundland’s. The clever ‘tuklok’ has a hole punched in the top at the side, through which you tuck the rest of the bag to keep it shut, minimising spillage. 3/5 . POUNDLAND: Tidy Z 40 refuse sacks . You get what you pay for with cheap bin bags, and they are usually, well, a little bit rubbish. These are fairly thin, so you may need to double up. 2/5 . DEHUMIDIFIER . TESCO: Jumbo-size scented dehumidifier . Suitable for all areas of the home this contains beads which draw in excess moisture from the air to stop damp, mould, mildew and condensation. This claims to last up to six weeks and has a lovely fresh fragrance. 5/5 . POUNDLAND: Green Jem jasmine scented hanging dehumidifier . This works in the same way as Tesco’s dehumidifier, but is designed specifically for wardrobes — removing moisture from clothes to prevent mould — and only lasts up to three weeks.  4/5 . TEA BAGS .

"By . Rob Draper . Follow @@draper_rob . After trying 55 players over 22 games, Roy Hodgson is set to gamble on youth when he names his England squad for the World Cup. Sportsmail take a look at the 23 players set for a place on the Three Lions' plane to Brazil this summer. GOALKEEPERS . Joe Hart . Age: 27 Club: Manchester City . Caps/Goals: 39/0 . Tournaments: 2010 World Cup; Euro 2012 . Verdict: Recovered from the early season downturn in form. Jolt of being dropped seems to have returned him to previous high standards and he has been crucial to City’s title bid. Safe hands: Joe Hart will start in goal for England after recapturing his form for Manchester City . Ben Foster . Age: 31 Club: West Bromwich Albion . Caps/Goals: 6/0 . Tournaments: None . Verdict: Roy Hodgson says that he does not chase retired England internationals — but he did so with Foster, wooing him back from exile to bolster his goalkeeping options. Foster made his debut in 200, retired from international football in 2011 but returned in February last year. John Ruddy . Age: 27 Club: Norwich . Caps/goals: 1/0 . Tournaments: None . Verdict: A choice between Ruddy and Celtic No1 Fraser Forster, 26, who also has only one cap. Both seen as good tourists but Ruddy edges it despite a difficult season for Norwich which ended in relegation even before today’s game with Arsenal. Selected for Euro 2012 but broke a fingerand missed out. In reserve: Norwich's John Ruddy should just pip Celtic's Fraser Forster to a place on the plane . Glen Johnson . Age: 29 Club: Liverpool . Caps/goals: 50/1 . Tournaments: 2010 World Cup; Euro 2012 . Distance covered in 2013-14: 168.2 miles . Verdict: Much depends on him, with Spurs right-back Kyle Walker injured. Needs to provide speed and energy going forward as well as defensive solidity. Gary Cahill . Age: 28 Club: Chelsea . Caps/goals: 22/2 . Tournaments: None . Distance covered in 2013-14: 184.1 miles . Verdict: Hugely improved this season, he was outstanding in the Champions League. He now needs to transfer that form to the World Cup. Missed out on Euro 2012 after breaking his jaw. In form: Gary Cahill has excelled for Chelsea this season and looks guaranteed to start in Brazil . Phil Jagielka . Age: 31 Club: Everton . Caps/goals: 24/1 . Tournaments: Euro 2012 . Distance covered in 2013-14: 144.8 miles . Verdict : Born in Manchester of Polish descent, Jagielka is solid at club level but the hamstring injury that blighted the second half of his season will be a concern. Opponents will feel England’s defence is vulnerable. Luke Shaw . Age: 18 Club: Southampton . Caps/goals: 1/0 . Tournaments: None . Distance covered in 2013-14: 205.9 miles . Verdict: The key decision for Hodgson — and he is veeringtowards the 18-year-old. Can even expect to play at times as England may want to rest Baines for a game. On the plane? Phil Jagielka (left) and Luke Shaw (right) could both be on their way to Brazil . Leighton Baines . Age: 29 Club: Everton . Caps/goals: 22/1 . Tournaments: Euro 2012 . Distance covered in 2013-14: 191 miles . Verdict: Finally England’s first-choice left back, having edged out Ashley Cole. Left athome in 2010 — having been named in the provisional squad — because Fabio Capello wrongly thought he was too introspective and would be homesick away from family. Phil Jones . Age: 22 . Club: Manchester United . Caps/goals: 9/0 . Tournaments: Euro 2012 . Distance covered in 2013-14: 146.6 miles . Verdict: Will be selected, with John Stones ready to come in if the shoulder injury doesn’t respond totreatment quickly enough. On the run: Leighton Baines is now England's No 1 left-back after ousting Ashley Cole . Chris Smalling . Age: 24 . Club: Manchester United . Caps/goals: 10/0 . Tournaments: None . Distance covered in 2013-14: 128.4 miles . Verdict: Not progressing as he should, his form has been marred by United’s poor season. But provides covers at centre-half and right-back. Made his debut against Bulgaria in September 2011. Steven Gerrard . Age: 33 . Club: Liverpool . Caps/goals: 109/21 . Tournaments: Euro 2000, Euro 2004, 2006 World Cup, 2010 World Cup, Euro 2012 . Distance covered in 2013-14: 203.9 miles . Verdict: A last tournament for the man who was an emerging star at Euro 2000. Reinvention as a holding midfielder has been hugely beneficial for England. Captain fantastic: Steven Gerrard, now 33, will skipper the Three Lions in South America . Jordan Henderson . Age: 23 Club: Liverpool . Caps/goals: 8/0 . Tournaments: Euro 2012 . Distance covered in 2013-14: 230 miles . Verdict: Transformed this season, his energy and tactical discipline make him natural starting partner for Gerrard, replicating their club link up. Went to Euro 2012 after Lampard’s injury. Jack Wilshere . Age: 22 Club: Arsenal . Caps/goals: 15/0 . Previous tournaments: None . Distance covered in 2013-14: 126.7 . Verdict: Once the jewel in the crown of England’s youngsters; now critiqued by Paul Scholes as a player not developing. Hodgson believes in him despite another season dogged by injury. In favour: Roy Hodgson is a big fan of Jack Wilshere, despite the Arsenal man suffering an injury-plagued season . Ross Barkley . Age: 20 . Club: Everton . Caps/goals: 3/0 . Tournaments: None . Distance covered in 2013-14: 174.9 miles . Verdict: A stunning goal and all-round performance against Manchester City seems to have tipped the balance as Hodgson opts for youth and vitality. Raheem Sterling . Age: 19 . Club: Liverpool . Caps/goals: 2/0 . Tournaments: None . Distance covered in 2013-14: 154.6 miles . Verdict: There are few surprises in World Cup football now but having only just broken through and never played in the Champions League, Sterling may shock a few opponents. Presumably not Liverpool team-mate Luis Suarez, though. Form player: Raheem Sterling has enjoyed an outstanding campaign in Liverpool's dynamic midfield . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain . Age: 20 . Club: Arsenal . Caps/goals: 14/3 . Tournaments: Euro 2012 . Distance covered in 2013-14: 43.2 miles . Verdict: At his best a key player, shining in the Maracana last year. Can also play holding midfield. His current groin injury and the fact he has completed just three games this season count againsthim. Adam Lallana . Age: 26 . Club: Southampton . Caps/goals: 3/0 . Tournaments: None . Distance covered in 2013-14: 249.9 miles . Verdict: Will start for England, representing an extraordinary rise in the past 18 months. Can be a key player either at wide left, wide right or behind the centre-forward. Likely to move to Liverpool. Fresh blood: Southampton's Adam Lallana has impressed during his three caps for England . James Milner . Age: 28 . Club: Manchester City . Caps/goals: 45/1 . Tournaments: 2010 World Cup, Euro 2012 . Distance covered in 2013-14: 117.8 miles . Verdict: Looked to be disappearing off the England radar but his key role in City’s title run-in sees him retained and increasingly likely to play a key role off the bench . Frank Lampard . Age: 35 . Club: Chelsea . Caps: 103/29 . Tournaments: Euro 2004, 2006 World Cup, 2010 World Cup . Distance covered in 2013-14: 130.6 miles . Verdict: Hodgson values him as a stable presence on and off the pitch. Plenty in the tank after an in-out season and will play at times to ease strain on Gerrard. Still got it: Frank Lampard should be fresh after playing less games for Chelsea this season . Wayne Rooney . Age: 28 Club: Man United . Caps/goals: 89/38 . Tournaments: Euro 2004, 2006 World Cup, 2010 World Cup, Euro 2012 . Distance covered in 2013-14: 190.4 miles . Verdict: For once, there are no injury worries going into a major tournament. England are less dependent on him now but he remains a vital part of the team. Rickie Lambert . Age: 32 Club: Southampton . Caps/goals: 4/2 . Tournaments: None . Distance covered in 2013-14: 197 miles . Verdict: A popular member of the squad, at 32 he gets his reward for the journey through the backwaters of football. Has never missed a penalty, so look out for him warming up in readiness for a 119th minute substitution. Rise: Rickie Lambert has gone from working in a factory to the brink of England's World Cup squad . Daniel Sturridge . Age: 24 . Club: Liverpool . Cap/goals: 10/3 . Tournaments: None . Distance covered in 2013-14: 142.1 miles . Verdict: One of the reasons for renewed optimism in England; a natural goalscorer with genuine pace who has flourished at Liverpool under Brendan Rodgers. Danny Welbeck . Age: 23 . Club: Manchester United . Caps/goals: 21/8 . Tournaments: Euro 2012 . Distance covered in 2013-14: 101.9 miles . Verdict: Distrusted by David Moyes but his ability to track back when wide left, as well as add speed and technical ability to counter attacks means he will play — and maybe even start against Italy. Versatile: Hodgson is a fan of Danny Welbeck's ability to play out wide and through the middle .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . A woman allegedly raped by disgraced former BBC broadcaster Stuart Hall (pictured) told a court today she is haunted by a recurring nightmare of the attack . A woman allegedly raped by disgraced former BBC broadcaster Stuart Hall between the ages of 12 and 15 is haunted by a recurring nightmare of his attacks, a jury heard. The woman told Preston Crown Court she suffered from terrifying dreams about the attack based on the memory of what happened to her. She denied the prosecution's claims the memory was 'a dream' - saying 'It absolutely categorically happened.' The woman later compared her experiences to . that of Jodie Foster, who played a gang rape victim in the film The . Accused, the court heard. The . woman, referred to as Girl B, told a therapist: 'I remember watching . The Accused... I threw up with the violence. Her pleading for it to . stop. That has stayed with me.' Hall, who was in his 40s at the time, was said to have forced his tongue in her mouth and repeatedly told her 'You’re special' as he raped her. Hall has already pleaded guilty to indecently assaulting her when she was 13. The former It’s A Knockout presenter . claims, despite that assault, he went on to have a consensual sexual . relationship with her in the years that followed. The alleged victim's mother convinced her . daughter to stay silent - fearing her father might 'kill' the Hall in . revenge, the court was told today. Hall, 84, has pleaded not guilty to 20 allegations of rape and indecent assault between 1976 and 1981 against two young girls. He . was jailed last year after he pleaded guilty to 14 offences of indecent . assault against 13 different girls, aged nine to 17, at the same court . and was jailed for 15 months, subsequently increased to 30 months at the . Court of Appeal. The trial continues. The court has heard how the alleged victim was working at a stables at the age of 12 when the TV celebrity - a family friend - turned up unannounced on a motorbike. He took her to a corner of the stables, pushed her up against the wall and then raped her, she said. Crispin Aylett QC, defending Hall, asked her: 'Might you have seen the defendant arrive on a motorcycle and what you are telling us about it now is something that has come to you in a dream?' She replied: 'You are completely incorrect. It is a memory that I dream about and a very, very vivid memory.' Mr Aylett said: 'This incident didn’t happen at all.' She said: 'It absolutely categorically happened.' Explaining the dreams, she said: 'It’s a recurring dream I have had all my life. In fact, I would change that word to nightmare. 'It’s a memory that haunts me. It wakes me up and it has done many times.' Mr Aylett said: “'here are times when you dream things that have never happened.' She replied: 'I think, if this had happened to you, you know it would have happened.' Hall, pictured outside court for a previous hearing, is alleged to have attacked Girl B - telling her she was 'special' as he raped her. The alleged victim categorically denied in court today the attack was a dream . Girl B became interested in a career in television and Hall invited her to his then workplace at the BBC studios in Manchester’s Piccadilly. She later visited another studio at Oxford Road in the city. Hall is said to have raped her at both locations. Mr Aylett asked the complainant: 'Did you ever say to the defendant ‘I would rather not have sex today’?' She said: 'No, it was not a relationship. I did not have a choice. I was not asked. I was not invited to comment.' The barrister went on: 'Did you ever do anything or say anything to indicate that you did not want to have sex?' Girl B replied: 'I didn’t want it to happen. It did happen. I felt guilty. I felt responsible. I felt it was my fault.' She conceded that he did not frighten her and was charming. He would tell her that he loved her and how special she was, she said. Mr Aylett said: 'Did you not rather like that?' She said: 'No, absolutely not then. It was hideous.' Mr Aylett said: 'Or now?' She said: 'The whole thing was extremely unpleasant. At that age and at that time you have to get through it the best way you can. 'I made that choice. I did not spend time thinking about anything else apart from just getting on with it and, frankly, surviving it.' She added: 'I would say he was very successful at getting what he wanted.' She said she did not specifically ask to go to the BBC. Preston Crown Court, pictured, heard how the alleged victim's mother persuaded her to stay quiet about the attack - saying her father would 'kill' Hall if he found out . The court heard that she told the police 'everyone at the BBC looked up to him (Hall)'. She said the usual pattern of behaviour from Hall was that they would drink champagne in between him going on screen - him drinking the best part of a bottle. She said: 'Stuart drank a lot. The best part of a bottle of champagne would be a glass for most people.' The court heard that Hall and the complainant went on to have intercourse at a flat. Mr Aylett asked her if it was the case that they 'made love' there rather than at the BBC when it was 'more hurried'. Girl B replied: 'Made love is just insulting... it was not a relationship. We did not ever make love. Certainly not from my side.' The jury was told that Hall and the complainant had discussed their sexual contact after it emerged that the defendant had abused other young girls. She said: 'He said ""You are different, it was not the same with any of the others"" and I was ""special"". 'I said ""But you have done this to these girls"".' Peter Wright QC, prosecuting, asked the witness: 'At any time, has he (Hall) ever apologised to you?” She replie he had not. Hall, 84, has pleaded not guilty to 20 allegations of rape and indecent assault between 1976 and 1981 against two young girls. The trial continues . Mr Wright continued: 'At the time when there has been any discussion between you in terms of what he had done, what was his reaction or demeanour?' She said: 'In recent times, remorseless.' Earlier, Mr Aylett asked the complainant if she intended to make a claim for compensation in relation to Hall’s admitted indecent assault on her. She replied: 'I have given absolutely no thought to making a compensation claim. Getting through this is my first thought.' Mr Aylett said: 'You are not ruling it out?' The witness said: 'I am not ruling it in. I don’t know what the process is.' Mr Aylett repeated: 'You are not ruling it out?' She replied: 'I find it very insulting at this moment in time to answer that question. 'It has taken an awful long time to choose to do this.' One of Hall’s 13 victims whom he admitted indecently assaulting last year was next to give evidence. She had been a friend of Girl B in their childhood. It is said she was abused on the same occasion at a dinner party when Hall indecently assaulted Girl B when she was aged 13. The woman, now in her late 40s, was 'stunned' and 'helpless' when Hall targeted her in a bath. As he abused her, he would say 'You’re beautiful and gorgeous' over and over again, the court heard. She said she confided in Girl B the next morning. She told the court: 'I told her what had happened to me and she told me he had gone into her room and did things to her.' She said the victim's mother told her not to tell anyone about the alleged attack in fear of what her husband might do to Stuart. The woman, who cannot be named, said she, Girl B and another teenager found a bottle of Martini, got drunk and ended up being sick. She said: 'I was undressed by Girl B's mum but she left the bathroom and Stuart lifted me into the bath. 'He then touched me intimately more than once with his finger and also touched my breasts. 'He lifted me out of the bath and into a towel on the floor and proceeded to touch me again in an intimate part of my body. 'I was shocked, stunned and paralysed by his conduct. I was feeling helpless by it. He told me I was beautiful and gorgeous and kissed me on the lips.' The jury heard that when Girl B's mother returned to the bathroom she asked why the door was locked and Hall let her in to finish dressing her. The next day she told Girl B what Hall did - and Girl B then told her how Hall had also indecently assaulted her as she lay drunk in bed. But when they both told Girl B's mum, she urged them to keep it to themselves fearing her husband's reaction if he found out what Hall did. The witness added: 'We spoke to her (Girl B's) mother the next day but she was concerned that we didn't say anything in case it caused trouble and in case Girl B's father killed Stuart.'

"By . Alex Miller . Liverpool face a ‘Group of Death’ next season on their return to the Champions League, with the Anfield outfit faced with the prospect of a group including Real Madrid and PSG. Brendan Rodgers’ side will be seeded in Pot Three as a result of a four-year exile from the competition that has lowered their UEFA ranking — and as a result will be handed a tough group. Trouble ahead: Liverpool face a Champions League group of death next season . Liverpool will also be drawn against a second seeded team, which include French champions Paris SG, Italian champions Juventus and Borussia Dortmund. Monaco and Roma lie in wait as two of the sides in Pot Four. The easiest draw Liverpool can expect would be against the likes of Porto from Pot One and Swiss champions Basel from Pot Two. Back then: Liverpool haven't been in the competition since 2009-10, where they exited at the group stage . Manchester City have been forced to tackle Groups of Death in their three seasons in the competition, but will find themselves elevated from Pot Three to Pot Two next season owing to their progression to the knock-out stages of this year’s Champions League and Manchester United failing to qualify for the tournament next season. As a result City will avoid another second seeded side. However the Premier League champions-elect are facing a £50million fine and restrictions on their Champions League squad size and a wage limit for failing UEFA’s Financial Fair Play rules. It is believed a Champions League squad reduction could see the club restricted to using between 18 and 21 players. A normal squad size is 25.

"By . Matthew Morlidge . Follow @@MattMorlidge . 'I watch him a lot and try to do the same things that he does,' Adnan Januzaj told Inside United of his infatuation with former Manchester United star Cristiano Ronaldo. And judging by their stats from their debut seasons at Old Trafford, the youngster's statement may just be more factual than first thought. For the duo scored an identical number of goals in their first full campaign at the club, as well as sharing almost identical records in other fields. Identical: The similarities are there, but will Januzaj (left) live up to his potential like Ronaldo (right) did? World class: Cristiano Ronaldo grew to be a United and eventually a world great . The statistics provided by Opta are from Ronaldo's 2003/04 season, and Januzaj's breakthrough campaign under David Moyes. Like Ronaldo, Januzaj has arrived as a youngster from foreign shores, eager to kick on and hold down a first team spot. But he has some act to follow. Upon signing Cristiano Ronaldo from Sporting Lisbon in 2003 for over £12million, Sir Alex Ferguson knew straight away a legend was born at Old Trafford. In his . autobiography, Ferguson described first seeing Ronaldo as ‘the biggest . surge of excitement and anticipation I experienced in football . management’. Goes down easy: Januzaj has been criticised for play acting on several occasions this season . Silverware: Ronaldo celebrates scoring the opener against Millwall in the 2004 FA Cup final . Stepovers and tricks followed on a Premier League bow against Bolton, with fans already in awe of their new Portuguese son. It was Ferguson who brought Januzaj to Manchester in 2011 from Anderlecht, but he never featured under the empowering Scot, only first impressing under countryman Moyes. His full debut at United - away at Sunderland in November - produced two goals and a man of the match award. A fine start, but their would be few supporters who would think the now fully-pledged Belgian can match the almighty career of Ronaldo. The . 18-year-old has hardly featured in recent months, and perhaps similarly . to Ronaldo, been criticised for falling to the ground too easily. Like for like: Ronaldo's first season is almost identical to Januzaj's first campaign at Old Trafford . Fan favourite: The Old Trafford crowd recognised Ronaldo's quality and potential straight away . Much to prove: Januzaj still has some fans to win over, and the new manager, too . The difference is, however, that Januzaj has picked up a staggering six yellow cards this season, all for simulation. Ronaldo has described himself in the past of being 'sent by god' to play football, but is somewhat ordinary statistics from his first season show that pressure should not be put on Januzaj so early in his career. If Louis van Gaal is to come in, a manager famed for overseeing progression of youth, the teenager could go on to forge a successful career in England. But after his first year, Ronaldo then went on to score 80 times in his next 167 league appearances for United, as well as a staggering 177 in 165 La Liga games for Real Madrid. That is the challenge Januzaj faces. On top of the world: Ronaldo won the Balon d'Or this year after Lionel Messi's dominance . Mega man: Ronaldo left after six years of service, and Januzaj will no doubt be hot property as well .","Ronaldo scored the same number of goals as Januzaj has in his first season .

Though Rodgers has vowed to fight until the final whistle on Sunday, he has conceded Liverpool’s hopes of winning their first title since 1990 have almost been extinguished after only taking one point from their last two games against Chelsea and Crystal Palace. But wherever Liverpool finish this campaign, Rodgers is aware that improvements need to be made to the squad during the summer and believes the fact they can guarantee Champions League football will give them a considerable lure. Top target: Adam Lallana (right) is wanted by Liverpool this summer . Liverpool did not sign anyone in January but their scouts have identified a number of targets, including Southampton’s Adam Lallana and Cardiff defender Steven Caulker, as having the potential to improve the squad and take the club forward. ‘The work has been on-going for a little while now, especially since we consolidated a place in the Champions League,’ said Rodgers. ‘I think we are a real attractive proposition to players through Europe. We are right on the football map now but we have got work to do. ‘We will see how quickly we can get things done. I meet regularly with the recruitment boys. For them and their status when they are going to games in Europe, meeting agents and watching players, it has been great (being in the Champions League already). ‘But we have to work hard to make the right decision for the right type of player to come in here. But there is no doubt it helps you a great deal. Last year we spoke to a number of targets but (missed out as) they wanted Champions League football.’ There is little doubt Liverpool’s lack of depth – players to change games – has proved costly this season, compared to a City side he has described as “having the highest wage bill in the history of sport”. Defensive rock: Steven Caulker is another name on Liverpool's shortlist . ‘The players we brought in last summer were young and for cover,’ he said. ‘Now we need to bring in starters. One of the things watching the Manchester City game the other night, they bring on (Stevan) Jovetic, who scores – £23million; Fernandinho £29million and (Alvaro) Negredo £20million. ‘That level of player to bring into the game is massive for you and this year the reality is we’ve been unable to do that.’ Rodgers has admitted the draw at Crystal Palace on Monday night, when Liverpool shipped three goals in nine minutes after leading 3-0, was the 'lowest he has felt in football' but he believes the chastening experience at Selhurst Park will actually help his side progress. ‘Sometimes I will say something after the game but I said nothing,’ he said. ‘I had my own thoughts and watched the game again on the way back before I went home; we’ve spoken this week and look to move on. There is a great deal of learning will come out of that game. It’s a great reference point. ‘But this is only the beginning for us. I hear about how other teams will improve next season but I think we will improve dramatically. Even people like Steven Gerrard will improve dramatically next season. We are really excited about the future.’ Man with the plan: Brendan Rodgers (right) is preparing to launch a spending spree this summer .","Adam Lallana and Steven Caulker are among Liverpool's top targets .

"By . Joe Bernstein . Ryan Giggs has advised incoming Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal to retain the influence of the Class of 92 when he takes over. Giggs, Nicky Butt, Phil Neville and Paul Scholes face uncertain futures at Old Trafford with Van Gaal’s appointment expected to be announced this week. Though Giggs is in no rush to sort out his own situation — he would prefer to spend his summer holiday before deciding whether he wants to continue playing — he thinks United would be better off keeping at least some of their famous old boys around. Scroll down for video . Big job: Louis van Gaal has much work to do when he takes over at Manchester United . Season of woe: Last year's champions Manchester United have slumped to seventh position in the league . ‘I would say there are definitely more plus points than there are minuses to keeping them,’ said Giggs. ‘With what the lads bring, and knowing the culture and history of the club and how it’s run, it can certainly be a plus. But ultimately it is down to the new manager. It’s a decision for him to consider.’ United’s board will let Van Gaal choose whether to keep the Class of 92 on board. Sir Alex Ferguson was keen on their involvement and appointed Butt as reserve-team manager before he retired. His successor David Moyes brought ex-United favourite Phil  Nevile back to the club as a coach and put Giggs on the staff as well, even though he continued to play. When Giggs became interim manager, he asked Scholes to help, too, and the quartet of ex-United players will be in the dugout for Sunday's final game of the season at Southampton. But retaining them is a risk for Van Gaal. As Moyes found out, they exert a powerful influence on the club and the Dutchman could come under pressure from fans if he loses games while Giggs is standing on the sidelines. Helping hand: Giggs (right) insists the Class of 92, including Butt, Phil Neville and Scholes, can aid Van Gaal . Giggs will consider becoming a manager elsewhere if he is not offered a playing contract and talks with Van Gaal about staying on the coaching staff do not go well. ‘I honestly don’t know what I’ll do next season. It’s something I haven’t experienced before and I’ll go away, chill out and make a decision,’ he said. ‘I’m lucky that I have a lot of options. 'If you really think about it, it could be a sad time but also an exciting time as well. Over the last couple of years I’ve had inquiries to go somewhere. But not in the past couple of weeks. ‘I’m open to so many things but I’ve got to seriously think about it, and that’s what I’ll do — whether to still play, whether to stay here, whether to go somewhere else, whether to chill out for a year and take a step back, as I’ve been in football since I left school. ‘Managing another club would be strange but I’ve got a little taste of management now and what I’ve been through in the last couple of weeks is a pretty good apprenticeship. I’m around next week and go away on Friday. It’s around that time when I’ll start  thinking about it. ‘I could get pushed next week on telling them what I want to do but from my side I’m not in a rush.’ Don't go! Fans hold up a banner begging their beloved player/manager not to retire at the end of the season . Van Gaal’s arrival will mark the end of an era at United after 28 years of Ferguson, his ‘Chosen One’ Moyes and Giggs. The Dutchman has no previous Premier League experience and Giggs said: ‘When it’s pre-season and there is a new manager, different methods and something you’re not used to, maybe it will be strange.’ Giggs’s reluctance to rush into a decision is taken on the advice of Ferguson, who thinks you act with a clearer mind after a post-season holiday rather than in May when you are exhausted from a long season. Van Gaal may be presented this week so he can then concentrate on taking Holland to the World Cup. He will get funds to revamp the squad and has been linked with his former Bayern Munich stars Thomas Muller and Toni Kroos, as well as Southampton’s Luke Shaw and Paris Saint-Germain striker Edinson Cavani.

"By . Jonathan McEvoy . If Lewis Hamilton wins the world championship, he can send the cheque to me, c/o of the Daily Mail.For, . lo and behold, his bulldogs Roscoe and Coco have been confined to . kennels. They will not be here at the Spanish Grand Prix, on the . instruction, it is said, of Niki Lauda, his boss at Mercedes. We . remember the cries of criticism when we gently nudged him to the view . that going around with a couple of dogs was not the sort of thing that a . first-rank sportsman did. Leave them at home, we urged, for your own . good. So . indignant were Mercedes at the comment - well-intentioned though it was . - that they banned this newspaper from Hamilton’s press briefings. Taking the lead: Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton walks with his dog in Monaco . But here, ahead of the Spanish Grand Prix, the fifth race of a season that Hamilton is dominating with the brilliance of his driving, this admission came. ‘The first load of races (Australia, Malaysia, Bahrain, China) were just so far for the dogs to travel. ‘I imagine it’s a bit than having kids to move around - all these jabs you have to get the dogs, the passports. It’s just been simpler to have them with my family. At the moment, it’s just me and my trainer.’ The one-eyed Lewis fans saw the suggestion that he keep his dogs at home as some serious insult. It was not. It was a suggestion made to help the most talented driver of his generation - the fastest driver in the world, possibly of all time - at a time when his then then new team, Mercedes, exercised no control over him to his own detriment. Had Lewis’s father, Anthony, been in control of him there is no way he would have countenanced the notion of dogs being carted around the world as if they were Louis Vuitton luggage. Brilliant: Lewis Hamilton has won three of the first four races this season . Focused: Hamilton sits in his car in the garage during practice ahead of the Spanish Grand Prix . It is a firm belief here that Hamilton’s . behaviour last year was a transitional phase: he was trying to find out . who he was after years in the narrow tunnel of McLaren’s tutelage and . his father’s massively controlling influence. Mercedes hailed the . extravagance of Lewis’s behaviour as a sign of his greater maturity. It . was not. It was his rebellion against a strait-jacket. What we see . now in Hamilton this year - 12 months and more after his move from . McLaren to Mercedes - is perhaps getting close to a settled position. He . is freer of mind and more relaxed in his own skin. Hamilton is doing . what he has always done: drive sensationally well. But despite having . won the last three races, he is trailing Nico Rosberg by four points. A . mechanical failure at the first race in Australia cost him in the . standings. He was brilliantly dominant again on Friday in practice. He was fastest in both sessions, on the first time occasion nine-tenths . of a second ahead of Jenson Button’s McLaren and then half a second in . front of his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg. Setting the pace: Lewis Hamilton was fastest in both sessions on Friday . ‘It’s been a great day . today and I’m happy to be back in the car after what feels like quite a . long break,’ he said. ‘I can feel the positive step forward that we’ve . made with the car, so a big thank you to everyone back at our factories . for all of their hard work since China. ‘I’ve not had such a good . Friday for a very long time. It’s very difficult to overtake in . Barcelona so we will do everything we can to qualify as high as possible . tomorrow. Position is everything. ‘But really it is all about the . race and looking after those tyres. Finally, it’s great to see so many . fans here today enjoying the action in this beautiful weather.’ After . his blazing start, Button slipped back to sixth fastest in the . afternoon, his McLaren less than wonderful. He said: ‘The afternoon . was where we expected to be. This morning was good and we were quicker . than expected. I don’t think it’s anywhere near as good as it looked . earlier. ‘This morning we looked a lot quicker, maybe because of . temperatures and fuel loads.’ Never mind fuel loads, or indeed anything . else. Unless Lewis Hamilton’s Mercedes blows up, he is on for victory . here. The dog-less star is simply way, way, way ahead of everyone.","Lewis Hamilton's bulldogs Roscoe and Coco have been confined to .

"By . Michael Wade . Follow @@MichaelWade_ . Marouane Fellaini has blamed injury for a below-par first season at Manchester United, but promised that the club will see the best of him next season. Fellaini was a deadline day signing from Everton for £27.5million but failed to live up to his hefty price tag as the Premier League champions failed to defend their crown and qualify for the Champions League. The midfielder injured his wrist in a Champions League match against Shakhtar Donetsk on only his third appearance for United, an injury which eventually required surgery in December and kept him out of action until February. Struggle: Marouane Fellaini endured a tough first season at Manchester United after joining from Everton . Improvement: But the Belgian midfielder says he will be fully fit and back to top form next season . But the Belgium international, who will play for his country at the 2014 World Cup this summer, is convinced that he will return to Old Trafford fully fit next season and prove that he is worthy of a place in the United team. Fellaini told the Daily Telegraph: 'I need to be fit to be good. Even when I am injured I can play but the fitness is not the same. I was injured for three months and that was a difficult moment for me. 'When you arrive in a new team you want to play, you want to stay with the team and when you can’t play it is difficult to see the team – even off the pitch. 'When this season finishes I will start with my preparation for the next year and it will be good.' Fellaini was signed for United by David Moyes, who he also spent five seasons under at Everton, and has backed his former boss to return to football quickly. He has also urged United fans to give United time to rebuild after this season's failure, but is confident that whoever is appointed to replace Moyes will be capable of turning the club back into challengers for top honours. Fellaini added: 'I learnt a lot from him and for that I am very grateful. It was a shame things didn’t work out for him at Manchester United but David is still a great manager and I’m sure he will be back in football very soon. Whoever becomes the next manager, they will bring fresh philosophies to help the players achieve what the fans want. 'The supporters and the people have to give us time. I know we can win in one game against any team. But when you play for Man United you need to win every game. I have never won a trophy in England. I will work hard, the club will work hard, and the new staff will work hard to win trophies. As players we must take responsibility for our performances and it is up to us to help the new manager turn United back into a team capable of winning the title.'

"By . Joe Bernstein . Matt Le Tissier names his five England penalty-takers for a potential World Cup shoot-out with the same authority as he once despatched his own spot-kicks. ‘No 1, Rickie Lambert,’ says the Southampton legend, whose record of 47 successful penalties from 48 attempts qualify him as an expert. ‘It’s not Southampton bias. His penalty record is awesome — impeccable. ‘Leighton Baines at No 2, good technique. Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard, three and four. On the spot: Rickie Lambert has never missed a penalty during his time at Southampton . Expert: Former Southampton star Matt Le Tissier, pictured here celebrating scoring a penalty against Newcastle, only missed one of 49 penalties in his career . ‘Steven has scored a lot of penalties this season, so he’ll be confident. I know Frank has missed a few, but he’s experienced and the sort of lad who would want to stand up and put himself in that position. No 5, Adam Lallana.’ But the records show that Lallana has never taken a penalty for Southampton mainly due to Lambert’s perfect record. ‘I’ve never seen Adam take a penalty,’ said Le Tissier. ‘But with his ability and attitude, I’d be pretty confident.’ Lambert faces a fight to even get into Roy Hodgson’s squad when it is announced on Monday, with Jermain Defoe and Andy Carroll also being backed to be England’s fourth striker. While his penalty record will not be the decisive factor, it surely gives him an advantage with England having crashed out of six of the last 10 tournaments in shoot-outs. Deadly: Everton's Leighton Baines, pictured here scoring a spot-kick against Manchester United, is a candidate to take England's penalties in Brazil . Mixed record: Chelsea's Frank Lampard (left) has missed a number of penalties in recent years . It might have been different had Le Tissier played in the Euro 96 semi-finals or 1998 World Cup tie against Argentina, but he only won eight caps and none in a World Cup or European Championship. England’s misses have come in all shapes and sizes. Remember Chris Waddle’s spacebound blast at Italia 90 or David Batty’s weak effort versus Argentina at the 1998 World Cup? David Beckham skied the first spot-kick against Portugal at Euro 2004. Jamie Carragher came up with a new one at the 2006 World Cup against Portugal, smashing the ball in before the referee signalled he could take it. He missed his ‘real’ attempt.

Rio Ferdinand fears Manchester United might have repeated the mistake they made in allowing Jaap Stam to leave by letting Nemanja Vidic join Inter Milan. Ferdinand's centre-half partner, 32, will join the Italians on a free transfer this summer, 13 years after Sir Alex Ferguson made a call he later regretted in offloading Stam to Lazio. Former United manager David Moyes has previously described Vidic's move as 'the right decision for club and player', but Ferdinand said: 'Only time will tell if Manchester United regret allowing him to leave. Deja vu: Rio Ferdinand (right) thinks Manchester United may regret letting Nemanja Vidic (centre) leave . 'Obviously . Jaap Stam played on for quite a few years at a good level after he left .

But he stressed the importance of Roy Hodgson and the future United manager not attempting to tame the volatile striker. Ferdinand . said: 'He has always limped into a tournament, he has always had . problems injury wise. 'If you get a fresh Wayne Rooney going into a . tournament, like we saw in Euro 2004, when he was young and fresh with . no injuries, you saw a guy who frightened teams to death.

'I . have no worries about him dealing with that. I would rather see Wayne . Rooney sent off once or twice a season because I want him to keep that . fire in his belly.

Tries from Tom Varndell and Charlie Davies gave the visitors a 13-0 lead . England prop Alex Corbisiero made his injury comeback in the 53rd minute . Saints will face arch rivals Leicester Tigers at Franklin's Gardens on Friday in their semi-final battle . By . Rob Wildman . England prop Alex Corbisiero made his long-awaited return in a memorable match which saw Northampton concede 13 points before racing to their record Premiership win. Corbisiero appeared in the 53rd minute after Northampton had overcome that early shock to seal second place in the Premiership and a home semi-final against Leicester on Friday night. The loose head, who has not featured since last November due to a knee injury, proved his fitness to face Leicester and may yet be joined by another England front-rower in Dylan Hartley. Running riot: George North scored twice as Northampton Saints thrashed London Wasps 74-13 . Hartley, who has not played since Leicester’s last visit here in March because of a shoulder injury, is said by Jim Mallinder, Northampton’s director of rugby, to be ‘improving by the day.’ Corbisiero ran on to a huge cheer from the Northampton fans who have not seen him play since October for his club. Mallinder added: ‘Alex loved it to be back on the pitch. He’s worked hard to get back and it’s brilliant for us that we have him as an option. ‘His selection is one of a number of options across the team. A lot of players have put their hands up to face Leicester. Diving over: Phil Dowson (bottom centre) also scored a brace as Northampton won at Franklin's Gardens . ‘We are physically and mentally in good shape and know Leicester will be very strong as they have a good record against us.’ Northampton scored 74 points without reply after going 13-0 down to early tries for Wasps by Charlie Davies and Tom Varndell. The best rugby came before half-time when Northampton scored four tries in a 16-minute spell combining forward might and some excellent counter-attacks. While Phil Dowson powered over from a line-out drive, Northampton’s swift handling brought tries for wing George North, fly half Stephen Myler and centre Luther Burrell. The one-way traffic continued after half-time to the embarrassment of Wasps. They were also not helped by sin-binning offences for No 8 Nathan Hughes, in the 33rd minute, and near the end of the match for captain Chris Bell. Scrum-half Lee Dickson scored twice for Northampton while North and Dowson also collected their second tries. Other scorers were full-back Ben Foden, wing Ken Pisi and substitute Tom Stephenson. On the ball: Stephen Myler (right) scored 14 points as Saints set-up a semi-final clash vs Leicester Tigers . The avalanche of scores left Dai Young, Wasps’ director of rugby, furious at his team’s display. ‘That was an embarrassment,’ he admitted. ‘There is no shame coming to Franklin’s Gardens and losing but to lose by that score is unacceptable. ‘That was our first team squad and we were just not good enough,’ Young added about a selected team which was below full strength. Back with a bang: England prop Alex Corbisiero (right) made his injury comeback for Northampton on Saturday . While Young rested some key players, . including England’s Joe Launchbury who was a second-half substitute, he . cringed at the final score. Wasps must now pick themselves up for a two-leg play off against Stade Francais to settle the final place in the next season’s newly-constituted European Champions’ Cup. Both finished seventh in their respective leagues. Mallinder was also a little surprised at the final score. ‘I was slightly worried when went 13-0 down but that was partly down to us because we were not accurate enough. False hope: Wasps' Charlie Davies (centre) try gave them a 13-0 lead before they were routed by Saints . ‘But what was pleasing was how we came back to dominate. We’ve got our home semi-final - that was our target. ‘Some of the young lads have put their hands up which was very encouraging. ‘The win gives us confidence but we won’t read too much into it. Wasps sent a weak side because they have their focus on next weekend in Europe and we are not daft enough to think anything else,’ he said bluntly.","Northampton Saints run in 11 tries as they thrash London Wasps 74-13 .

"By . Yvonne Swann . Anne Reid said that meeting her idol gave her a new found confidence after the death of her husband . The day that changed my life was 3 July 1986, when I went to see American actress and singer Barbara Cook at London's Donmar Warehouse. For anyone who doesn't know her work, Barbara is a huge star in America and a Tony Award winner. Last year President Obama made her a Kennedy Center Honoree, a distinction she shares with the likes of Fred Astaire and Meryl Streep. I'd seen her on TV and thought she was amazing, but going to her show that night changed my life in so many ways. I became an obsessed fan and followed her around for the next 11 years until I finally got to meet her. Any time she was in England I went to see her, and I was so inspired by her singing that I began taking lessons. She influenced my lifestyle too. After my husband died I'd been a bit nervous about travelling on my own, but because I wanted to see Barbara perform I started to fly to New York. Then, in 1997, my lovely friend Thelma Barlow, best known as Mavis Riley on Coronation Street, invited me to Anthony Hopkins' New Year's Eve birthday party at the Bombay Brasserie in London. I couldn't refuse when she told me Barbara would be performing her cabaret act! At last I was introduced to Barbara and got to know her. The following year I saw her again at the Donmar, and she invited me to New York to see her perform at the Café Carlyle and join in the wonderful party afterwards. What a glorious trip that was, and Barbara and I have been great friends ever since. She sends presents to my grandchildren and I now go to New York most years to see her. Through Barbara I've met the most amazing people. For example, one New Year's Day I was invited to her apartment in New York for a dinner party, and she said, 'I've placed you next to Stephen, because I thought you'd like that.' I said, 'Oh lovely, Stephen who?' And she replied, 'Stephen Sondheim, of course!' Can you imagine how thrilled I was! After meeting, Anne Reid and Babara Cook became lifelong friends . Barbara and I also went to Paris together one year - we went to the opera and wandered round the city linking arms while Barbara told me all about working on Broadway with Robert Preston and Richard Rodgers, and honestly I just thought I'd died and gone to heaven. And another thing - where I live now is a direct result of knowing Barbara. The photographer Mike Martin, who took all her photographs, became a friend too, and when I was looking for a flat in London he said, 'There's one going in the block next to me.' The singing lessons I took when I was a fan, but not yet a friend, have also changed my life. I now do my own cabaret act, singing and telling stories about my life. Barbara gave me some good advice when I started, and a high point for me was singing Bosom Buddies with her on stage at the English National Opera when she came over to do a charity event a few years ago. So seeing Barbara Cook on stage all those years ago really was absolutely life-changing. Happily she loves Last Tango In Halifax and can't wait for the second series to be televised in the States in June. Anne sings at the Newbury Spring Festival on 19 May.

"By . Lizzie Parry . Are you consumed by a fear of dirt and germs, obsessed with washing your hands? Do you repeat certain actions a set number of times or worry that your home may be burgled or ravaged by fire? If so, you could be among one of the millions of people worldwide battling Obessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). OCD is a chronic mental health condition associated with obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviour. A sufferer is compelled to carry out repetitive actions or mental acts. To take the OCD test click below . Often they feel they need to carry out their compulsion in order to prevent their obessession from becoming true. For a sufferer obsessed with a fear of being burgled, they may feel compelled to check and re-check the locks on their doors and windows multiple times before being able to leave the house. It is one of the most common mental health disorders, affecting between 1 and 2 per cent of the population, according to the charity OCD Action. A test used by the Channel 4 show Embarrssing Bodies asks how you would react to a set of circumstances. It was developed by Dr Wayne Goodman of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine. It features 25 key questions to give an insight as to whether a person is at risk of developing the condition. Examples include: 'Are you over concerned with keeping objects (such as clothing, shopping, tools) in a perfect order, or arranged exactly?' and 'Do you repeat routine actions a certain number of times or until it just feels right?' So far . 83,327 people have taken the OCD test, with 28 per cent of men scoring . in the highest at risk category and 36 per cent of women found to be in . the highest at risk category. People living in northern England and Northern Ireland show the highest incidence of OCD. Those . in the 18 to 30 age bracket were at the highest risk of suffering OCD, . with those aged between 56 and 60 found to be at lowest risk. People . working in the food, drinks and retail sectors were more prone to the . condition, while IT workers were least likely to suffer OCD. A test to establish whether you are at risk of developing OCD will be discussed on the Channel 4 show Embarrassing Bodies. So far of the 83,327 people who have taken the test, 28 per cent of men and 36 per cent of women scored in the highest risk category, while those living in northern England and Northern Ireland were shown to be most likely to suffer the condition. Those aged between 18 and 30 are most at risk of OCD, while people in the 56-60 age group are less likely to suffer the condition . The 25-question quiz asks people how they would react to a series of circumstances to establish whether they are at risk of developing OCD . OCD is categtorised by four stages, obsession, anxiety, compulsion and temporary relief. A . sufferer will become overwhelmed by a constant obsessive fear or . concern, such as the possibility they will contract a serious illness . through contact with germs. Their . thoughts will develop into an anxiety and intense stress causing them . to develop a pattern of compulsive behaviour in order to reduce anxiety. That behaviour will inspire temporary relief from the anxiety but the obsession and anxiety will return, and the cycle begins again. A form of psychotherapy, known as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), can be successful in treating OCD. With the right treatment, OCD can be managed very effectively with a likely reduction in the severity of the symptoms, helping achieve a good quality of life. In some cases, treatment can lead to a total cure. The results of the tests will be discussed on tonight's episode of Embarrassing Bodies, on Channel 4 at 8pm. The test assesses how much time a person spends each day consumed by their obsession, and how hard it is for you to control the compulsion. The results of the test are set to be discussed live on the Channel 4 show Embarrassing Bodies .","25-question quiz asks if you worry about keeping items in perfect order or if you repeat routine actions .

"By . Lizzie Parry . When you order a takeaway online you subconsciously select more food to feast on, major food retailers have revealed. Perusing a menu from the comfort of the sofa on a touchscreen tablet or mobile phone encourages a hungry diner to order more food, compared to those ringing in their requests. While on the phone, customers tend to stick their 'usual' order, when presented with a full and tempting menu online, appetisers, side orders, fizzy drinks and desserts creep in. And retailers have noticed people are more likely to try new dishes they would never have thought about ordering. Ordering takeaways online encourages customers to order more food giving them the chance to peruse the full menu boosting the number of add-ons and side dishes . In the U.S. a staggering 40 per cent of all Domino's orders are made online, the pizza chain revealed . Pizza chain Domino's has revealed a staggering 40 per cent of its U.S. sales come from orders made through desktop computers, smartphones and tablets. And last week the firm introduced its new iPad app, designed to further boost sales. Domino's spokesman Chris Brandon, told Co.Labs, that the major benefit from customers ordering online is the rise in extras and side orders. 'With Domino's before, you only needed to know a phone number and to think of your regular order or pizza order,' he said. 'Now that we have sandwiches, specialty pizzas, chicken, all these additional products and desserts, it increases sales.' Mr Brandon said online orders also tend to be more accurate, with a smaller margin for mistakes, previously often the result of staff taking orders over the phone in noisy stores. Online orders tend to be more accurate, encouraging customers to come back for more food . And that, he says, boosts customer satisfaction encouraging people to come back for more. 'There are 34 million ways to make a single Domino's pizza, and a lot of conditions can get lost in translation. Digital ordering can take care of a lot of that,' he added. A further benefit for tech-savy food outlets is designing apps and features to entice younger customers. The Domino Pizza Tracker and the chain's 3D modelling feature in the new iPad app helps retain a younger market. And the information gathered by the firm through digital orders, allows the company to discover 'over-performing stores' that could be split in two and helps target specific areas based on ethnic eating habits.","40 per cent of Domino's orders in the U.S. are made online .

"By . Lizzie Parry . Beardilizer aims to give folically-challenged men a boost, promising to boost facial hair growth through its mix of nutrients and vitamins . Never mind balding treatments - now there's a 'fertiliser' which promises to boost beard growth. The supplement, called Beardilizer, is aimed at follically-challenged men desperate to grow facial hair but struggling to achieve anything more than stubble. The product claims to promote the growth of facial hair by stimulating follicles, resulting in a thicker, more luscious beard to match those sported by George Clooney, Brad Pitt, David Beckham, Ben Affleck and Superman actor Henry Cavill. It was launched after it became fashionable to have a beard - and it has been such a hit that around 1,000 bottles are apparently flying off the shelves every day. Beardilizer is made from a blend of vitamins and minerals that its makers claim nourish facial hair follicles. Users are recommended a dosage of three capsules a day for between one month and six months. A one-month course of the supplement, which is made entirely from natural products, costs £28.90 and can be bought in the UK online. The product was the idea of Laurent Cohen, whose Florida-based company has been making health and beauty products for 12 years. Mr Cohen, 42, said: 'We have been in the health and beauty business since 2002 and we are always looking for new, innovative products. 'In the past few years having a beard has become very cool and we noticed there wasn't anything on the market to help those who struggle to grow one. 'In 2011 we started working on a formula for a supplement to stimulate beard growth. Actor and director Ben Affleck is among the Hollywood stars who have made beards fashionable again . Using the Beardilzer supplement could help men cultivate impressive facial hair similar to that sported by Brad Pitt (left) and Superman actor Henry Cavill (right) Beardilizer contains a range of vitamins and nutrients that are known to promote hair growth. Vitamin C boosts collagen production, which surrounds the hair strands, protecting hair from breaking. Biotin is a water soluble vitamin of the B complex which promotes hair and scalp health. Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) helps the body produce keratin - a protein in the hair. Vitamin A is needed by the body to create sebum, an oily substance created by our sebaceous glands to provide a natural conditioner for a healthy scalp. 'Facial hair follicles are different to hair follicles on your head and if you nourish them with good nutrients you can get brilliant results. 'You can't fight genetics, and Beardilizer is not like a magic wand you can wave and grow a beard overnight. 'But after four weeks of taking it you will definitely start to see results, and after two or three months you will be very happy indeed. 'Beardilizer is made from totally natural ingredients. 'We stand by its quality and there have been some great results. The feedback has been tremendous. 'Sadly it doesn't work the same on head hair, otherwise I'd be a millionaire by now!'

"By . Chris Paine . This extraordinary artwork gives a whole new meaning to the phrase 'my body is a temple'. Body paint artist Trina Merry spent around nine hours painstakingly painting the 17 naked models and forming them into a living, breathing temple. The work was released by Trina to promote her partnership with charity Beyond the Four Walls - an organisation that works with young women in Nepal to help improve their lives. 'Body art is the most traditional art form - it's the most ancient art form known to man and pre-dates even cave paintings,' the 34-year-old said. 'I enjoy the human-to-human intimate connection.' Scroll down for video . Start of a big project: Models practice their positions before being painted . It took the models nine hours in total to be painted . Trina began making body art in 2006 and . took it up full time in 2011 - her temple structure was displayed at . WORKS gallery in San Jose, America in March. Despite being posed up for only 20 minutes, some of the models found being a naked human canvass a little intimidating. 'Some people are uncomfortable when they are first nude in front of others,' added Trina. 'I try to be gentle and talk through things with each person and work with their levels of comfort so they feel safe. 'But when you're in a room full of 16 other nude people you get over your fears pretty quickly. 'It becomes more normal to be the nude person than the one with their clothes still on, so peer pressure works in my favor in those instances.'

"By . Sarah Griffiths . A competition for school children has been launched to design a British-inspired, balanced meal for Major Peake (pictured) to eat during his mission to the ISS . The International Space Station may be 230miles (370km) above the Earth, but British Astronaut Tim Peake will still be able to get a taste of home thanks to a new competition. Next year, he will begin his journey into space to spend six months on the ISS and will be able to dine on a meals created by school children – with the help of a famous chef. The UK Space Agency has launched a competition for children between the ages of seven and 14 to design a British-inspired, balanced and exciting meal for Major Peake to enjoy during his mission. The winning contestants will work with Heston Blumenthal to transform their ideas into real space food that will be blasted the astronaut’s temporary home. They will also be invited to an event that will include a live link-up with Major Peake during his stay on the ISS. ‘This is a great opportunity to get people thinking about nutrition and healthy eating,’ Major Peake said. ‘I’m really excited that I’ll be able to eat a “Great British Space Dinner” onboard the space station and for me it will be a very special link back to planet Earth!’ ‘I think that by blending the creativity from the competition and Heston’s expertise we can produce something that is not just fun, healthy and tasty but also food that will be really important for the future of space travel.’ Scroll down for video . Dinner time: To enter the competition, children have to take account of healthy eating principles as well as the constraints of space to design a British meal that can be packaged and preserved for the long trip. Here, astronauts show off their floating dinners aboard the ISS . A competition to name Major Peake's first mission to the ISS closed last month. It was part of a long-held tradition in which the public choose mission names every time a European astronaut goes into orbit. Previous mission names have included ‘Marco Polo’ for the Italian Astronaut Roberto Vittori and ‘Odissia’ for Belgian Frank de Winne. Major Peake, 41, said: ‘The ISS is a cutting edge research laboratory that is pushing the boundaries of what is scientifically, technically and humanly possibly. ‘My six month stay onboard mankind's outpost in space is going to be both challenging and incredibly exciting. ‘The scientific experiments conducted will be wide ranging, covering areas such as medicine, human physiology, core science and material science.' The winning entry, which has yet to be announced, will be incorporated into a logo. Major Peake told BBC News that food on the ISS was not as 'nice as it could be' and while it is nutritious, it is often 'lacks taste and texture'. 'You don't want a mushy paste. You want something with texture and a crunch to recreate some of the memories of eating food on planet Earth,' he said. To enter the competition to design a more satisfying meal, children have to take account of healthy eating principles as well as the constraints of space to design a British meal that can be packaged and preserved for the long trip. There will be a winner from the primary level category and for secondary level children. Mr Blumenthal said: ‘I’m unbelievably excited to be designing a delicious meal for Tim to enjoy in space; there are some real challenges ahead, things aren’t quite the same up there! ‘I’m really looking forward to seeing some incredible suggestions by the kids, and getting started on creating something that Tim will love up there in space.’ Lots of the food that is sent to the ISS is dehydrated and packed in vacuum bags so it is small and light. The crew mix up their food with water and often suck it straight out of the packets with straws. As well as lacking texture, the food often seems bland to astronauts as they lose their sense of smell and therefore their taste. This happens because blood flows to their heads in zero gravity and makes their faces swell up, blocking their noses. Not renowned for its food: Lots of the food that is sent to the ISS (pictured) is dehydrated and packed in vacuum bags so they are small and light. The crew mix up their food with water and often suck it straight out of the packets with straws . Before joining the Esa astronaut corps in 2009, Major Peake was a helicopter pilot and a test pilot. He was assigned his mission in May 2013 and has been training non-stop to be part of Expedition 46/47 to the orbital outpost. He is following a long line of British explorers and scientists, from the North Pole and the Nile to the Himalayas and now to outer space. 'As a former test-pilot I believe that knowledge is gained when we explore the boundaries of what is technically and humanly possible,' Major Peake said. The winners of the competition will play a small part in British space history as Major Peake will become the first British astronaut to visit the International Space Station as well as the first official Briton in space. A team of judges, which will include Major Peake, Heston Blumenthal and experts from the British Nutritional Foundation, will select the best entries from both the primary and secondary school age categories. They will be looking for fun and healthy menus that excite Tim, have an element of Britishness, and have the potential to be transformed into a space dinner that could be flown to the ISS. Entries must be submitted by noon on June 30 to the UK Space Agency. There is a set of educational resources to accompany the competition entry form, which can be downloaded from the UK Space Agency’s website.

"By . Kieran Corcoran . and Sophie Jane Evans . Leonardo da Vinci could have pioneered the world's first 3D image by painting two similar portraits of the Mona Lisa, it has been claimed. The Renaissance artist produced two almost identical copies, which when viewed next to one another would create the impression of depth, according to German art researchers. The effect would reportedly be similar to superimposed images used today to create the . impression of three-dimensional drawings, which are often viewed with . red and blue tinted glasses. Artworks: Leonardo da Vinci could have pioneered the world's first 3D image by painting two similar portraits of the Mona Lisa - the famous Mona Lisa at the Louvre (left) and the 'Prado Mona Lisa' (right), it is claimed . The extraordinary theory was revealed in a paper by Claus-Christian . Carbon and Vera Hesslinger, according to the Huffington Post. It relies on a similar painting to the Mona Lisa - unveiled in 2012 . - being produced by the artist himself rather than a student, as has . been theorised. The researchers analysed the copy, called the 'Prado Mona Lisa', at the Museo del Prado in Madrid, Spain, as well as the famous portrait of Mona Lisa that hangs at Paris's Louvre museum. They discovered there was a slight perspective shift between the artworks - with the painter (or painters) having created them from different vantage points. Difference: German reseachers discovered there was a slight perspective shift between the artworks - with the painter(s) having created them from different vantage points of around 2.7 inches in horizontal distance . These points measured around 2.7 inches in horizontal distance - which is similar to the average distance between a person's eyes, they found. 'When I first perceived the two . paintings side by side, it was very obvious for me that there is a very . small but evident difference in perspectives,' Mr Carbon, of the University . of Hamberg in Germany, told Live Science. 'This is particularly clear if . you observe the chair on which La Gioconda sits: In the Prado version, . you can still see the end of the end corner of the chair at the . background of the painting, which you cannot see in the Louvre version.' Copy: The theory relies on the 'Prado Mona Lisa' being produced by the artist himself. The difference in vantage points is reportedly 'particularly clear' if you observe 'the end of the end corner' (circled) of Mona Lisa's chair . He said this was because the painter of Prado Mona Lisa - supposedly, da Vinci himself - had been positioned more to the left than the creator of the Louvre artwork. The researchers then cited the manner in which our eyes perceive objects at varying perspectives, before sending individual, flat images to our brain to be translated into one three-dimensional picture. Using this notion, they concluded that the two paintings, when viewed together, could present the first stereoscopic image in the world. Study: The researchers used a red-cyan anaglyph to combine the two paintings of the Mona Lisa (pictured) The researchers added that they had used a red-cyan anaglyph to combine the two portraits - and it had backed their theory that the finished product portrayed depth. But they admitted it was impossible to know whether the stereoscopic masterpiece was a coincidence, or whether da Vinci had knowingly created it as part of a science project. Three-dimensional? They claimed the finished product (pictured) backed their theory that the paintings, when viewed together, portrayed depth . As well as creating artworks such as 'The Last Supper' and 'The Vitruvian Man', da Vinci is also renowned for his work in the fields of anatomy, geology, mathematics and literature, among others. He was one of the greatest anatomists the world had ever seen - with his intricate knowledge of the human body demonstrated in a collection of notebooks which he filled with detailed studies of organs, bones, vessels and muscles. In February this year, it was revealed that Italian art detectives are a step closer to identifying the lady behind the artist's famous Mona Lisa portrait. DNA tests are underway on bones that may belong to a Florentine noblewoman, named Lisa Gherardini, who is widely believed to be the model for the painting. Historian Silvano Vinceti has taken samples from a skeleton in Sant’Orsola convent near Florence and is comparing them to DNA from the bones of some of Gherardini's confirmed relatives. If a DNA match is made, Professor Vinceti will make a 3D reconstruction of Gherardini's face from the skull, as well as details in da Vinci’s Mona Lisa painting. The results from the analysis should be ready by May or June, the professor told the Wall Street Journal. Lisa Gherardini is thought to have posed for the painting between 1503 and 1506. Leonardo da Vinci is best known for his stunning artwork but the Italian Renaissance painter had many talents. He . was also a sculptor, architect, musician, mathematician, engineer, . inventor, anatomist, geologist, cartographer, botanist, and writer. The . Mona Lisa is his most famous and most parodied portrait while his . painting of The Last Supper is the most reproduced religious painting of . all time. Leonardo's . drawing of the Vitruvian Man is also regarded as a cultural icon - being . reproduced on items as varied as the euro coin, textbooks, and . T-shirts. Only around . fifteen of his paintings survive because of his constant, and frequently . disastrous, experimentation with new techniques, and his chronic . procrastination. Leonardo is also revered for his technological ingenuity. He . conceptualised a helicopter, a tank, concentrated solar power, a . calculator, and the double hull, also outlining a rudimentary theory of . plate tectonics. Relatively . few of his designs were constructed or were even feasible during his . lifetime, but some of his smaller inventions, such as an automated . bobbin winder and a machine for testing the tensile strength of wire, . entered the world of manufacturing unheralded. He . made important discoveries in anatomy, civil engineering, optics, and . hydrodynamics, but he did not publish his findings and they had no . direct influence on later science.","Renaissance artist painted two similar images of Mona Lisa, it is claimed .

"By . Emma Innes . In an incredible act of generosity, a mother offered to act as a surrogate for her ex-husband’s new wife. Julie Brackenbury, 34, offered to carry Rebecca Hankins’ baby after the 33-year-old was left infertile by cervical cancer treatment. Julie, who had previously been married to Rebecca's husband, Scott, even went through gruelling IVF treatment to have the couple’s embryos implanted into her womb. Julie Brackenbury (left) offered to carry Rebecca Hankins' baby after the 33-year-old (right) was left infertile by treatment for cervical cancer. Julie was the ex-wife of Rebecca's husband, Scott . Rebecca told MailOnline: ‘Julie is a very motherly sort of person and we had grown quite close. ‘She understood my need to be a mum. But, despite this, I was mind-blown when she offered to be our surrogate.’ Rebecca, from Stamford in Lincolnshire, and her husband, Scott, had been trying for a baby for a year when she started to suffer bleeding after sex. The veterinary nurse, who was desperate for a child, visited her doctor who told her that she had a polyp which was probably responsible for the bleeding. She had the polyp removed but, devastatingly, tests revealed it was cancerous. At the age of just 27, Rebecca was diagnosed with cervical cancer. At the age of 27 Rebecca was told she had cervical cancer and that the treatment would leave her unable to carry children. Before starting treatment she had some of her eggs harvested and had some embryos frozen . When Julie (pictured with her son Louis) heard about Rebecca's situation, she offered to act as a surrogate. She went through two rounds of IVF to have the frozen embryos implanted into her womb . She said: ‘I was devastated, but it was more the fact it would leave me childless, than the cancer itself, that worried me.’ Rebeccca had to have chemotherapy and radiotherapy as well as surgery to remove some of her lymph nodes. As a result of the radiotherapy she was told she would not be able to carry a child and would go into early menopause. She was desperate to have a baby so she delayed her treatment to allow her to harvest some of her eggs and freeze some embryos. Tragically, both cycles of the treatment failed and Julie (pictured with her new partner, Luke) did not become pregnant with Rebecca's baby . She says . that no one wanted her to do this as everyone, including her doctors, . felt it would be better for her to start treatment immediately. Despite this, she delayed her treatment for a month to enable her to have the procedure carried out. She said: ‘For me there was so point having cancer treatment if I couldn’t have a baby so there was no question about it.’ Once Rebecca had recovered from her cancer treatment, she started to look into her fertility options. Incredibly, at this point Julie, who has five of her own children, offered to be a surrogate. She said: ‘Watching them go through cancer was hard and I got close to Rebecca. ‘The thought of them not being able to have a baby was awful and it was the thought of what I could give them at the end that made me want to do it.’ Julie, who lives in Peterborough, added that she wasn’t worried about the thought of having to hand the baby over once it was born as it wouldn’t be hers genetically and she had worked it out in her mind. Eventually, in 2010, Julie went through two round of IVF during each of which she had two of Rebecca’s embryos implanted into her womb. Tragically, neither of the IVF cycles worked and Julie didn't become pregnant. Rebecca said: ‘It was devastating when the pregnancy test was negative. ‘I collapsed in a heap the second time as I knew I had no more frozen eggs to try. Rebecca said: 'It was devastating when the pregnancy test was negative. I collapsed in a heap the second time as I knew I had no more frozen embryos to try' ‘I was grateful for everything she had done.’ Julie added: ‘It was dreadful, it was awful – it really was heart-breaking. ‘She took it hard but she was strong with it. ‘I felt really responsible and I felt I was letting her down.’ She added: ‘It didn’t really matter that the father would have been my ex-husband – it did raise a few eyebrows though.’ Rebecca and Julie are still friends and Rebecca has now been given the five year all clear from her cervical cancer. However, sadly, her marriage to Scott broke down as she wanted to look into adoption and he didn’t. She now has a new partner, Mark, and the pair are considering adoption. Since the failed IVF treatment, Rebecca has broken up with Scott (pictured with his son, Louis) and she had her new partner, Mark, are now looking into adoption . Rebecca said: ‘A baby would be the ideal situation as I would like the experience of having a baby but we would consider a child of any age. ‘I would love to have two eventually.’ Rebecca is holding a Night In fundraising event to raise money for Macmillan Cancer Support as the charity supported her when she was ill. The charity’s Night In idea sees people have friends round for an evening and they each donate what they would have spent on a night out. Rebecca said: ‘I want to give something back to the charity that helped me. ‘A lot of women don’t talk about female cancer and Macmillan gave me useful advice and emotional support.’ Rebecca will be hosting a Night In for Macmillan on Friday 16th May. The event is simply about having friends round for a catch up, a laugh and something to eat and drink. A Macmillan spokesperson said: 'The beauty of it is that you don’t have to train, get sweaty or even have to hassle people to sponsor you. 'Everyone just gives what they’d have spent on a night out and the money goes to help people keep on living life during and after cancer.'

"By . Mia De Graaf . She is currently a favourite to win the contest after years of failed attempts to bring Eurovision back to the UK. But Prime Minister David Cameron has admitted he has no idea who Molly Smitten-Downes is. It is hardly a promising sign for the 27-year-old - whose own music teacher even says she won't win tomorrow's contest. Scroll down for video . David Cameron froze when he was asked to name the UK's Eurovision entry, Molly Smitten-Downes (right) Molly, who will perform her song Children . Of The Universe in Copenhagen on Saturday night, is going into . the contest with the best odds Britain has had for years. However, Cameron froze when asked if he knew who was representing the nation. 'The awful thing is, you've got me there, I don't,' he admitted in an interview with BBC Radio Suffolk. He added: 'Is Terry Wogan still doing it? He was great, wasn't he? He still is great.' Former host Sir Terry Wogan gave up the job in 2008 and was replaced by Graham Norton. Asked whether he would be joining millions of TV viewers in watching Eurovision tomorrow, Mr Cameron said: 'Probably not, if I'm absolutely honest.' David Cameron confessed he will not be watching tomorrow night's contest, held in Copenhagen, Denmark . Molly, singing Children Of The Universe, is going into the contest with the best odds for years . Doubts: Despite strong support for Molly in her hometown of Leicester (right) and a good reception from Europe, her singing teacher Noel Henry (left) said she would be 'lucky' to finish inside the top 10 . The UK is hoping to improve its fortunes . after two woeful years when veteran acts Engelbert Humperdinck and . Bonnie Tyler were chosen and languished towards the bottom end of the . voting table. Unfortunately, Molly's singing teacher at Our Lady’s Convent School in Loughborough is not so confident. Noel Henry, 54, said: 'I don’t think Molly will win unfortunately because I think the competition is too political. 'I think whoever sang for the UK would not stand a chance of winning but I certainly hope to be proved wrong with Molly. 1. Sweden (11/4) 2. Netherlands (3/1) 3. Austria (7/2) 4. Armenia (5/1) 5. UK (9/1) 6. Hungary (12/1) 7. Ukraine (14/1) 8. Greece (20/1) 9. Denmark (25/1) 10. Norway, Spain (33/1) 'I think if she comes in the top ten then that will be an incredible achievement and I wish her all the best of luck. 'If I could talk to her before she goes on stage I would just tell her to be herself and enjoy herself.' Britain, like France, Luxembourg and Sweden, has won the contest five times and finished runner-up on a record 15 occasions. Only Ireland has won it more times, with seven successes since Eurovision started in 1956. In 1967, Sandie Shaw took the title for the UK with Puppet On A String, followed two years later by Lulu with Boom Bang-a-Bang. It took another seven years before Brotherhood Of Man performed Save Your Kisses For Me in 1976 and brought the accolade back to the UK. In 1981 Bucks Fizz won with Making Your Mind Up. And the last time Britain was crowned winner was in 1997 with Love Shine A Light by Katrina And The Waves. Before 1998, the nation only finished outside the top 10 twice. Since then, however, the entries have been branded a 'national joke', finishing towards the end of the table year after year. In 2003, 2008 and 2010, the acts finished last. Worst result ever: The UK has had a turbulent few years, receiving no votes at all for Jemini in 2003 . Bonnie Tyler hoped her strong European fan base would boost the UK's chances but she came 19th . Molly Smitten-Downes has had her chances of winning cut dramatically after it emerged almost no radio station around Europe is playing her song . Every year, we write off our Eurovision song contest entrant as a no-hoper. But this time round, it seems we have even less of a chance than usual. Molly Smitten-Downes has had her chances of winning cut dramatically after it emerged almost no radio station around Europe is playing her song. The 27-year-old, who will take to the stage in Copenhagen tonight with her ballad Children Of The Universe, is suffering from a media blackout in all of the key voting blocs, figures reveal. It has not been played once in the past month in Austria, Belgium, France, Hungary, Italy, Norway, . Poland, Romania and Switzerland, according to the UK’s official airplay compiler Radio Monitor. In others, such as Estonia, Iceland, Latvia and Lithuania, it has been played only a handful of times. In Britain the track has been played 2,346 times in the past 28 days, though most stations have played it only once or twice and it failed to make the Radio 1 playlist altogether. And many radio listeners say they have never heard of Miss Smitten-Downes, who has been plucked from obscurity to represent us by the BBC. Last night Ladbrokes had her odds at 9/1, with Sweden’s Sanna Nielsen the 11/4 favourite to win. Third favourite is Austria, whose contestant is a bearded transvestite  who performs under the name  Conchita Wurst. Miss Wurst, the alter-ego of 25-year-old Thomas Neuwirth, has upset some of the other countries taking part, notably Russia. But the singer said: ‘It’s just strange that a little facial hair causes that much excitement.’ Jemini's rendition of Cry Baby in 2003 received no points at all. Molly will be the last act to perform on the night, with Eurovision experts saying it is a good position because the song will still be fresh in the memory as voting begins. She landed her place in the final because the UK is one of the competition’s five big players who, along with the host nation, get an automatic place. However Ireland, which has often performed well in the contest, have not been so lucky, with their entry, Kasey Smith, crashing out in the semi-final stages this week. Austrian drag act Conchita Wurst - the 'bearded lady' - has got through to tomorrow’s finale, which will be broadcast live by BBC1. Bearded lady: Austria's entry Conchita Wurst has gained a strong following in the run up to the competition . Molly’s effort has so far failed to resonate with music buyers at home, with the song likely to achieve number 34 in the singles chart, according to latest figures from the Official Charts Company. However, even that lowly placing is better than the past two efforts, with Tyler’s 2013 song failing to chart and Engelbert Humperdinck’s entry the year before only making it to number 60. Bookmaker Hill is predicting the biggest year yet for betting on the contest as it predicts more than £1 million will be placed in stakes. Spokesman Rupert Adams said: 'We have never seen so many bets on the Eurovision Song Contest - records could be broken and there is even a chance we will see a UK winner.' Veteran singer Englebert Humperdink took a stab at the elusive title in 2012, but finished in 25th place . Since 1999, the UK has automatically qualified for the final, along with France, Spain and Germany, as they are the contest's biggest financial contributors. However, the nation has since finished last three times. In 2003, Liverpool duo Jemini received no points for their song Cry Baby. Andy Abraham only received 14 points in 2008, coming last. And Josh Dubovie crashed into bottom place with That Sounds Good To Me in 2010, which only merited 10 points. Since then, big names have tried their luck at the title, but success has eluded them. Boy band Blue managed to clamber up to 11th place with I Can in 2011, scoring 100 points. But in 2012, veteran singer Englebert Humperdink finished 25th with just 12 points. In 2013, Bonnie Tyler did little better, finishing 19th with only 23 points. Many claim it is not the acts but the rules - and European politics - that have led to the UK's demise. Only two British acts (Jessica Garlick, 2002, and Jade Ewen, 2009) have made it into the top five since the official body ruled countries do not have to sing in their native language. Isolated from the rest of the continent, and notoriously sceptical about the EU, many feel the UK has been boycotted by mainland Europe. In 2008, Sir Terry Wogan alluded to the politics that go in to voting, saying 'it is no longer a music contest'.","Molly Smitten-Downes, 27, is third favourite to win the contest tomorrow .

Gateshead are a win away from a return to the Football League after a 54-year absence as they prepare to face Cambridge United in the Skrill Premier play-off final at Wembley a week tomorrow. Gateshead official Jeff Bowron explains why the FA Commission’s proposed changes make their remarkable comeback story even more unlikely... I felt sick when I heard about the proposals. Totally deflated. It’s very, very worrying for a club like Gateshead and I really hope this is not allowed to happen. Plan B? FA chairman Greg Dyke has proposed to restructure lower leagues by introducing Premier League B teams . English football is all about the 92 League clubs, as well as the 15 or so professional clubs in the Conference. And yet this feels like the Premier League is just wagging its tail again. It’s all right for the Premier League and Championship because these new B sides won’t be allowed promotion above League One but it’s a different story for the rest of us. We have waited 54 years to get back into the Football League. Now it feels so near they want to dilute and weaken the achievement. Just our luck. They’re talking about B teams but what they mean is reserve teams. Say we do go up and we get the chance to play away at a club like Portsmouth, FA Cup winners not so long ago. That would be a massive game for Gateshead. But under these proposed new rules we could be forced to play West Bromwich Albion reserves instead. What’s that about? And how competitive are these B teams going to be? Surely Everton B aren’t going to care about getting three points in the same way as Gateshead would if we went to Plymouth or AFC Wimbledon in League Two, for example. Bundles! Gateshead players celebrate  during their play-off semi-final victory over Grimsby Town . And who is going to watch them? Clubs . like ours are supported by people in the area; people for whom Gateshead . really means something. There’s history and tradition there. Where will they even stage their games? They’ll probably have to borrow non-league grounds. You’re just weakening the league from all different angles.

"By . Associated Press . Flanked by bargain-priced displays of women's wear and patio lighting, President Barack Obama came to a Wal-Mart store in Silicon Valley on Friday to praise new steps by businesses and communities to deploy solar energy. The President was showcasing efforts to combat climate change that don't rely on a disinclined Congress. But in choosing the giant retailer as . the backdrop for his announcement, Obama also triggered a backlash from . labor unions and pay equity advocates who say low wages paid by Wal-Mart . fly in the face of Obama's vaunted push on pay equity. Scroll down for video . President Barack Obama poses for a photo after speaking at a Walmart store in Mountain View, California on Friday . 'What . numbskull in the White House arranged this?' former Labor Secretary . Robert Reich, who served in the Bill Clinton administration, said on . Facebook. Obama said more . than 300 companies and state and local governments have pledged to use . solar technology, and he unveiled his own executive actions aimed at . increasing energy efficiency with a goal of reducing U.S. reliance on . carbon fuels. The two tracks underscored Obama's . strategy of sidestepping Congress to advance his own agenda, but they . also illustrated the limits of his reach in a bitterly divided . government. 'The commitments . we're announcing today prove that there are cost-effective ways to . tackle climate change and create jobs at the same time,' Obama said at a . sprawling Wal-Mart store in Mountain View. President Barack Obama speaks at a Walmart store in Mountain View, California, on Friday . The solar effort will power the equivalent of 130,000 homes, the White House said, while Obama's administrative actions could reduce carbon pollution in an amount equal to taking 80 million cars off the road for one year. The White House also announced that long-delayed energy efficiency standards for walk-in coolers and freezers have finally been completed. Ticking off a list of economic and environmental benefits he attributed to solar technology, Obama cast the commitments as part of a broader campaign to reduce American energy dependence, create jobs in renewable energy and lower heat-trapping emissions blamed for global warming. 'This is what you call a win-win-win,' Obama told about 250 store employees as he wrapped up a three-day swing through California focused heavily on raising money for Democrats in advance of November's midterm elections. Obama announced new steps by companies, local governments and his own administration to deploy solar technology . Tweaking the mostly Republican opponents of his energy policies in Congress, Obama lamented that lawmakers have 'not always been as visionary on these issues as we would like.' That's why he's seizing opportunities this year to act unilaterally to advance those goals, Obama said. 'Unfortunately, inside of Washington, we still have some climate deniers who shout loud,' Obama said. 'But they're wasting people's time on a settled debate.' His policies unable to generate momentum in Congress, Obama has increasingly gone outside the federal government to press his agenda. He has won commitments from colleges and universities to expand access to more students; he has created innovation hubs that link businesses and education institutions; and he has drawn attention to companies and state and local governments that have increased pay for workers. President Barack Obama waves after speaking at the Walmart store . Still, that choice of tactics has severely limited what Obama may be able to accomplish, a reality the president acknowledged the night before as he spoke to donors at a fundraiser in La Jolla benefiting House Democrats. 'Regardless of how hard I push, regardless of how many administrative actions I take, we're not going to be able to go where we need to go, and can go, and should go unless I've got a Congress that's willing to work with me,' Obama said. The White House said it chose Wal-Mart because the company has committed to doubling the number of solar energy projects at its stores, Sam's Clubs and distribution centers. The Wal-Mart location he visited gets about 15 percent of its power from solar panels. Wal-Mart's president, Bill Simon, said. Obama is the first president to visit one of the chain's warehouse stores.","Pay equity advocates say low wages paid by Wal-Mart fly in the face of Obama's vaunted push on pay equity .

"By . Sami Mokbel . Follow @@SamiMokbel81_DM . The Norwich players liked Chris Hughton, but knew results weren't good enough. There was a feeling . among some members of the squad that a change was needed. But when it came, they didn't expect Neil Adams, a man who had no senior football management experience, to be Hughton's replacement. Needless to say, the change hasn't worked and Norwich now face a summer of transition. Seb Bassong, Leroy Fer and Gary Hooper are among those who want to leave this summer. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Neil Adams talk about the disappointment of relegation . Gone! Chris Hughton was sacked by Norwich late in the season when they already looked in trouble . There will be more who will look to leave; England keeper John Ruddy one of those whose future is now shrouded in uncertainty. Let's go back to Hughton's sacking on April 6. It's funny how words can come back to bite you on the backside. Here's an example. 'We will stay up - but we've made this change with that in mind,' said Norwich chief executive David McNally in explaining his decision to sack Hughton and replace him with rookie boss Adams. Oh dear. Only a miracle can save the Canaries from returning to the Championship now. They have to beat Arsenal on Sunday, hope Stoke defeat West Brom at the Hawthorns  - and then hope for a 17 goal swing. For all intents and purposes, Norwich are relegated. But who is to blame? Hughton can take a share, as should the players. But McNally's contribution shouldn't be under estimated. The man to come back? Celtic are interesting in buying back striker Gary Hooper from the Canaries . Wanting out: Sebastien Bassong (left) and Leroy Fer also want to leave Carrow Road this summer . And the players know it, too. Certain members of the Canaries squad have been left bewildered at the utter indecision from McNally over the past 12 months and believe he has contributed significantly to their downfall. The first real doubts over Hughton's reign emerged towards the end of last season. Despite leading Norwich to an excellent 11th place in their second season back in the top-flight, the Canaries board were not happy. A lack of goals and what was perceived as a negative style of play were causes for concern despite their healthy league position. McNally even canvassed opinion from the playing squad about Hughton's reign last April - with the majority of them providing a healthy reference of their manager. Nevertheless, since then Hughton had been fire fighting; keeping the wolves from his door at a game at a time. The club were privately planning for life without Hughton. Norwich legend Malky Mackay - who was manager at Cardiff at the time - was a favourite among the Canaries hierarchy. If there had been a realistic chance of luring him away from Wales, then McNally would have jumped at it. Black tie day: David McNally made the decision to get rid of Hughton so late in the doomed season . It was hoped the signings of attacking talent such as Ricky van Wolfswinkel, Nathan Redmond and Hooper would help Hughton build a more expansive and attacking team. But their fears over negative tactics re-surfaced again following a disappointing start to the season that saw them score just six goals in their opening nine Premier League games. McNally was ready to pull the trigger, but a 3-1 win over West Ham in November saved Hughton.Another dreadful run of one win and just five goals in 11 matches put Hughton's job on the line once again in February. But this time the club's doubts over Hughton were laid bare for all to see following McNally's now infamous BBC interview where he admitted a plan was already in place should the club decide to sack their manager. Out of his depth? Neil Adams was handed an unenviable task of taking over from Hughton last month . Another win, this time over Tottenham yet again saved Hughton's job - but just one win in the next six games was enough for McNally, as he finally wielded the axe. But the question is: why did it take a year for the club to bite the bullet and sack the former Newcastle boss? The board were obviously unconvinced, as were supporters who gradually started to turn on Hughton. In confirming Hughton's sacking in in April, McNally said: 'If we go down will I resign? That would be a matter for me to discuss with the board. I'm aware of my responsibilities.' Indeed, you are partly responsible for taking Norwich down.","Gary Hooper, Leroy Fer and Sebastien Bassong keen to leave Norwich .

Richard Scudamore is unlikely to face calls for his resignation from within football after the leaking of private emails left the Premier League chief executive facing accusations of sexism. Scudamore has been forced to issue a public apology after a former personal assistant went to a Sunday newspaper with emails, intended only for close friends, that contained a number of crass, puerile sexist jokes. There was also a steady flow of criticism on Sunday, with Dame Tessa Jowell among those to condemn one of the most powerful men in the game. Season finale: Scudamore in attendance at Manchester City's match against West Ham . Pensive: Scudamore looks to have things on his mind as he takes his seat at the Etihad . But the FA declined . the opportunity to join the chorus of disapproval - despite the Premier . League’s opposition to Greg Dyke’s England Commission proposal for B . teams - and other senior figures in the game have chosen to back him. Karren . Brady, the West Ham vice-chairman and one of the most prominent women . in football, contacted Scudamore on Saturday night to offer her support, . assuring him that in 20 years she has never considered the 54-year-old . to be sexist. Aware on . Friday that the story was going to be published, Premier League . officials contacted their stakeholders on Saturday to warn them of the . potential storm. Scudamore was due to appear on Sportsweek on BBC Radio 5 Live on Sunday morning but withdrew for ‘legal reasons’. Even so, Scudamore - at the Etihad on Sunday for Manchester City’s encounter with West Ham - had to face a barrage of criticism. Richard Scudamore, Premier League chief executive, is a married father-of-five who lives in Cirencester, Gloucestershire . Jowell accused Scudamore of . undermining support for women’s football. ‘His championing of women’s . football, and women’s football coming of age, is undermined by this,’ she told Sportsweek. The former culture secretary and Olympics minister added that the comments were ‘incredibly disappointing’ and . ‘unacceptable’, saying: ‘You can’t have one position publicly and then be . laughing privately.' Jowell continued: ‘In the world of . social media and email, there is no public and private. ‘I . think what Richard needs to reflect on, and I think he’s a decent man, . is the disconnect between what he thinks privately and what he has tried . to achieve publicly. ‘I . hope his public commitment to women’s sport will prevail and he will be . mortified by this, as indeed he should be.’ In his statement, . Scudamore said the comments were made in ‘private emails exchanged . between colleagues and friends of many years’. ‘They . were received from and sent to my private and confidential email . address, which a temporary employee who was with the organisation for . only a matter of weeks, should not have accessed and was under no . instruction to do so,’ he said.

"By . Becky Barrow . The average cost of a home in ‘prime’ areas of London will be more than £2million by the end of next year, a report by one of the capital’s leading estate agents predicts today. The report, from the estate agency Marsh & Parsons, says: ‘Jackpot prices are fast becoming the norm [in the capital].’ House prices in London have jumped by more than a quarter over the last year. Average London house prices are set to break the £2million mark . For example, the average three-bedroom home in a ‘prime’ area of London has risen by nearly £270,000 over the last year, equal to around £5,100 a week, to an average price of £1.67million. Prime London is not just the most exclusive areas, such as Kensington, Chelsea, Notting Hill and Little Venice, but includes places such as Barnes, Battersea, Balham and Clapham. Peter Rollings, chief executive of Marsh & Parsons, said: ‘Smart buyers can earn more money from their house in a year than by going to work in a very well-paid job.’ Unlike their job, the money that they make by selling their home is tax-free, as long as it is the only property that they own in the UK. At present, the average home in a prime area of London, of any size, is worth £1.5million. But the average price will ‘exceed £2million by the end of next year’, if prices continue to rise at their current pace of 4.3 per cent every three months. Average house prices in the capital have jumped by a quarter over the last year . A separate report found the number of first-time buyers who are crippled by negative equity has fallen sharply around the country. Negative equity is when the size of your mortgage is larger than the value of your home. Of the 364,000 young people who bought for the first time in 2007, the year that house prices peaked, just 22,000 remain in negative equity, according to Countrywide, the property firm. In 2008, it found nearly two-thirds of first-time buyers were in negative equity after the value of their homes typically dropped by £30,000, but the number of victims has dropped from 60 per cent to just six per cent today. Those who live in the North East remain badly affected, followed by those in Yorkshire and Humber and the North West. In London, the East, the South East and the South West, less than one per cent of first-time buyers are in negative equity, according to Countrywide. Meanwhile, the scale of house price rises in the capital has raised fears of a bubble that the pace of growth is unsustainable. Official figures reveal homeowners who live in south-west London have nearly £30billion of mortgage debt, more than the total population of Wales. Overall, the Council of Mortgage Lenders found homeowners with a postcode which begins SW owe a total of £29.4billion, compared to only £28.6billion in the whole of Wales. Lucian Cook, director of residential research at the estate agency Savills, recently warned: ‘Let’s be clear - this level of house price growth in London is not sustainable. 'Prime' areas of London, where prices are highest, include places like Battersea and Clapham, not just the traditioanlly wealthy boroughs such as Chelsea and Kensington . ‘It will have to slow.’ But Mr Rollings insisted it is ‘difficult to see how prices can fall while demand for property remains so high.’ He said the demand for homes is 20 per cent higher than the same time last year, while the amount of properties being put up for sale is 25 per cent lower. A separate report predicts the average home in London will be £331,000 next year, which is over the current inheritance tax threshold of £325,000. The tax is charged at 40 per cent on everything over this threshold. The problem will spread to the South East a few years later, with the average home in this affluent region going over the crucial threshold in 2019 when the average price reaches £340,000. Patrick Reeve, managing partner at Albion Ventures, a venture capital investor, said: ‘Rising house prices have been welcome news for many, but there is a downside in that many more homeowners will be liable for inheritance tax. ‘It is no longer the very wealthy who are affected by this tax and it is becoming increasingly important, particularly for homeowners in London and the South East, to take action to reduce their liability.’ The Marsh & Parsons’ report said the number of foreign buyers is dwindling but there has been a ‘huge surge’ in the number of UK buyers buying a prime London home. Between February and April, UK buyers represented nearly eight in ten of all buyers.","House prices in London have jumped by a quarter over the last year .

In order to perform the operation, held under the supervision of a doctor, he cut a metre-long gash from his neck to his thigh, and filmed it on a camera. Incredibly, he underwent the entire procedure without any form of anaesthetic. Body of work: In order to perform the operation, He Yunchang performed under the supervision of a doctor, he cut a metre-long gash, from his neck to his thigh, and filmed it on a camera . The scarred way: He wears the rib in his studio in Beijing, left, before showing the scar he got when performing the artwork . Chinese blogger and art consultant Mélanie Wang described the oeuvre, called 'One-Meter Democracy', on her blog. She wrote: 'Before the execution of this operation, there was a pseudo-democratic voting procedure.' 'According to the artist Ah Chang [sic], the vote was under the guise of a democratic process to decide whether he was going to perform his work or not … the result was 12 votes in favor of the work and ten against, with three abstentions.' That's when the gruesome procedure began. Body tension: He said the work, called 'One Meter Democracy' was intended to highlight the 'tension between the individual and the state' in China . Public vote: He named the work 'One-Meter Democracy' after cutting a metre from his neck to his thigh after asking 25 people in the room to vote on whether he should do it or not . 'Artistic performance can be distinguished from everyday life only when it is given a certain intensity,' he said after the performance. 'I want my work to move people.' He added that the work was designed to highlight the 'tension between the individual and the state' in China. Born in 1967, He is now one of China's leading performance artists, known for performances designed to test his strength and endurance. Previous works include casting himself inside concrete for 24 hours, trying to ‘cut a river in . half’ with his own blood while suspended from a crane. Strong art: Born in 1967, He is now one of China's leading performance artists, known for performances designed to test his strength and endurance . He says: 'I feel that China is a very complex society, one in which it is important to use your body and your intellect so you can stop and face its reality' He says: 'I feel that China is a very complex society, one in which it is important to use your body and your intellect so you can stop and face its reality. 'Highlighting the body in this way, as separate, is also important because, historically Chinese people have not endowed the physical body with value, rather they have valued the spirit of the Chinese people, as a collective. 'Contemporary China is much more individual in its thinking, so it’s a pull between the two. By putting pressure on an idea about myself (my intellect) and my own body, I can make it into something much larger.'","He Yunchang is one of China's most famous performance artists .

"By . Travelmail Reporter . A football-mad boyfriend cut short a romantic holiday in Mexico with his girlfriend - to fly back home to play for his village pub team. Chris Jones, 26, from Cardiff, borrowed £1,100 from his mum to get on a plane to make the 5,000-mile trip home halfway through the dream trip. The delivery driver was on a two-week holiday to Cancun with girlfriend Sarah Walker when he discovered his team had been picked to play at a Premier League stadium. Dream holiday: Chris Jones, who plays for Max United, cut his Mexico trip short to play for his team . Stunning location: The trip to Playa del Carmen was the couple's first holiday for six years . And Chris had to tell Sarah, 25, he was blowing the whistle on their first holiday for six years. Chris said: ‘Luckily for me Sarah knows I am obsessed with footie - she was fairly understanding. ‘But it was a bit tough telling her I wanted to leave the sun-kissed beaches of Mexico to fly home to Cardiff for a match.’ The pair had saved up for the romantic all-inclusive holiday in Playa Del Carmen. They spent the first week sunbathing, jet skiing, strolling along the palm fringed beaches and eating in top restaurants. Big match: Football-obsessed Chris said he wouldn't miss the chance to play for his team at Cardiff City Stadium . Long way home: Chris had to ask his mum for the £1,100 to pay for the flights back to the UK . But Chris checked his Facebook page and discovered his team Max Utd had been picked to play at the Cardiff City stadium. Chris is the club's top scorer with 23 goals this season so he knew he had to be there. He said: ‘I would describe myself as obsessed with football - I play every Saturday and Sunday and then five-a-side twice a week. ‘If I had missed this I would have been gutted - of all the players in the club it probably means more to me than anybody. ‘To play in a premiership standard stadium is a dream come true.’ Chris couldn't afford the air fare home but his mum Lesley Jones, 47, offered to pay - forking out for a return trip because it was impossible to buy a single. The couple took a nine-hour flight back to Gatwick Airport and were back in Cardiff ready for the kick off against pub side. Dream destination: The couple had booked a two-week trip to Cancun, which was cut short . Chris, of Tonypandy, near Cardiff, said: ‘Sarah was a bit upset but she is alright about it now. ‘But she warned me she'll be bringing it up again in future, she got a lot of credit.’ Sarah said: ‘We were having a great time in Mexico but I know how much football means to him. ‘The weather we had was really good but it was changing when we left and looked like rain, so it worked out well.’ Amateur clubs in South Wales were asked why their team deserved the unique opportunity to play at the 27,000-seater Cardiff City Stadium Max United and pub team the Maltsters Arms won the chance to play each other. Chris's mum Lesley Jones, 47, said: ‘I knew he would want to come back and play but he's always been football mad.’","Chris Jones left Mexico after a just a week with his girlfriend .

"By . Carol Driver . A terminally ill woman was evicted by police from a holiday villa, after the travel company failed to inform her it had cancelled her booking. Lorraine Beasant was on a family trip to Mallorca – her last before her latest round of treatment for cancer – when she was forced to leave the five-bedroom property on the first night. The 57-year-old, who was on holiday with her husband, Mike, her three grown-up children and friends, booked the £1,450-a-week break through Villa Parade in 2013. Nightmare holiday: Lorraine and Mike Beasant were evicted from their villa during a family break to Mallorca . Luxury villa: The five-star property which the Beasants were evicted from in northern Mallorca . However, the company failed to tell Mrs Beasant she was no longer able to stay in the property, only sending her an email the day before her April 12, 2014, booking, which she did not read. The 10 adults arrived at Villa Moncho - chosen because it had a downstairs bedroom so Mrs Beasant would not have to carry her medical equipment up stairs - gaining entry at about 2pm by using a code which was provide to them by Villa Parade. However, neighbours alerted the Spanish owner, who called the police, who arrived later that evening. Mrs . Beasant told MailOnline Travel: ‘We were having a barbecue when the owner and the local police turned . up at about 9pm. My son came in and said “I’m sorry to do this mum, but . we’ve got to move out”. ‘It was a shock. It really upset me to be evicted hours after arriving.' Family break: Mr and Mrs Beasant, bottom right, were holidaying with friends and family in Mallorca . Popular destination: The Beasants were staying in Port de Pollenca in northern Mallorca . The . property owner – who did not want to be named - claims he cancelled his . contract with Villa Parade in November 2013. He said he had no knowledge of Mrs Beasant's booking and called the police to help with translation. Mrs . Beasant, who has been told she has up to six months to live without treatment, said: 'We didn't see the email from Villa Parade as we were travelling. ‘They knew we would be, so why they tried to contact us on that date is beyond me. ‘It was to be the last holiday with my children before my treatment, which is going to be horrendous. ‘Because my children live all over the UK, it was incredibly important to get this holiday together.’ Downstairs bedroom: Inside the villa Mrs Beasant booked with Villa Parade . Five-star property: The Beasants had booked Villa Moncho to accommodate their large party . Mrs Beasant's family was moved to a nearby villa through Villa Select, booked through Villa Parade the day before the party was due to arrive in Mallorca, but it didn’t have a downstairs bedroom. She said: ‘I was ill during that week because I had to deal with the stairs all day, and when you’re on oxygen… that was upsetting. ‘I have emailed Villa Parade about the situation, and they said they would look into it and come back to us within 28 days.’ Jason . Kelly, a spokesman for Villa Parade said: ‘This matter is currently subject to an investigation in conjunction with ABTA and we are unable to make further comment at this time. 'Villa Parade would like to stress that they did try on four separate occasions to contact Mrs Beasant by phone to explain that the villa had been changed to a new property, but they could not get a response and on April 11, an email was issued stating that an alternative property had been arranged for her. 'Mrs Beasant however, arrived at the original villa, which, at the time was still being occupied by the owner. 'Shocking': Villa Moncho in northern Mallorca from where the Beasants were evicted . Family destination: The beach of Puerto Pollensa near to the villa the Beasants booked with Villa Parade . 'Villa Parade can confirm the Mrs Beasant was moved to the new property later the same day. 'As a . small independent villa operator, Villa Parade always put its customers . first. And, as members of ABTA and ATOL, Villa Parade works tirelessly . to ensure we provide the high standards expected by our customers, and . the rules and regulations required by ABTA and ATOL.

"By . Emma Innes . When Gemma Wood was just 25, she started to notice bleeding every time she went to the toilet. She repeatedly visited her GP and expressed her concern that she was suffering from bowel cancer. On three occasions over six months, the doctor told her she was too young to have the disease. Scroll down for video . Gemma Wood (pictured, right, with her best friend Beth), 28, was diagnosed with bowel cancer after nine months of being told by doctors that she was too young to have the disease . Shockingly, nine months after she first developed symptoms, further tests revealed she was right - she was, indeed, suffering from the cancer which normally affects people over the age of 65. Ms Wood, from Rutland, told MailOnline: ‘I thought I had cancer and that was my biggest fear but the doctor said I was too young. ‘Despite the GP, I was still worried and it was always at the back of my mind. ‘I was told it was piles and I did believe the doctor in a way - I thought I would just have them removed.’ Ms Wood, who plans events and weddings at her family’s golf course, started to notice bleeding when she went to the toilet in January 2011. She also noticed that she was losing weight gradually and her stomach became uncomfortable. Before she was diagnosed, Ms Wood went to her GP four times suffering from bleeding when she went to the toilet, weight loss, fatigue and stomach pains . Ms Wood (left as a bridesmaid at her best friend Beth's wedding) had to have chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery after the cancer was finally diagnosed . Initially, she believed that her weight loss was down to working hard and being on her feet all day at work. However, by July she was starting to feel tired and her stomach was painful at night. Between January and July Ms Wood, who is now 28, visited her GP three times. On the first occasion the doctor asked her what she believed was wrong with her and she said she thought she had bowel cancer. Bowel cancer is cancer which starts in the large bowel. It is sometimes also called colon cancer or rectal cancer. Symptoms include blood in the stools, a change in bowel habits, abdominal pain and unexplained weight loss. As the disease progresses, it can also cause fatigue and breathlessness. Bowel cancer is the third most common type of cancer in England and there are about 40,000 cases diagnosed every year. Approximately 72 per cent of bowel cancer cases occur in people who are over 65. People who are older, who eat a diet low in fibre and high in fat, those who are overweight and those who take little exercise are most at risk. People who smoke and drink a lot of alcohol, as well as those with a family history of the disease, are also at increased risk. Source: NHS Choices . However, the doctor dismissed her concerns saying she was too young. At first, she was told she had piles and was given treatment for this but it failed to stop the bleeding. By the time she returned to the doctor, she had also developed acid reflux so she was given medication for this but that also failed to help. Finally, at the end of the summer, she returned to the doctor for a fourth time and an internal examination revealed some old blood. As a result, the doctor referred her to a specialist thinking she might have Crohn’s disease. Ms Wood had a procedure during which a camera was used to look at her bowel. She said: ‘As soon as the doctor put the camera in, she went very serious. ‘She said she had found a polyp – I could see it on the screen and it was horrible. ‘The lady went to get a second opinion and the doctors said it was something they only see in the over-50s. ‘Even so, at this point I still just thought it was a polyp that would have to be cut out.’ Ms Wood was quickly sent for an MRI and CT scan at Peterborough City Hospital and was given the results a week later. She was told that she had bowel cancer but that it had not spread. She told MailOnline: ‘I was – I can’t really explain it – I got really angry and shouted at my parents that I knew I had cancer and no one believed me.’ Ms Wood was advised that she would need to start treatment as soon as possible but that she could, firstly, have some of her eggs harvested and frozen as the treatment would leave her infertile. After much deliberation, she turned down the offer as she wanted to get on with the treatment. Ms Wood (second from right with friends during a charity run) has been left with a stoma bag and has also been told that she will not be able to have children because of the treatment she received . She had three months of chemotherapy followed by five weeks of radiotherapy. She then had a break from treatment to regain her strength before having surgery to remove the lower part of her bowel, including the tumour. As a result, she has been left with a stoma bag - she had to have an ileostomy which is a surgical procedure to link the end of the small intestine to an opening in the abdomen. She now has to connect an external bag – a stoma bag - to the opening to collect waste products. Following the surgery, she had to have another three months of chemotherapy and she was only given the all clear in December 2012. She now has to have check-ups every six months but this will soon change to every two years if everything goes well. Her surgeons have also explained that her cancer was not caused by her diet or lifestyle and that they are also unable to find a genetic cause. Ms Wood has now been free of the disease for more than a year but continues to have regular check-ups . They say she was probably just very unlucky. She said: ‘I am angry that it took so long for me to get the diagnosis and I don’t see that GP any more. ‘But, I can see that doctors don’t expect young people to have cancer – let alone bowel cancer. ‘I think that if people are bleeding they should always be checked out.’ She added: ‘Now it is like the cancer never happened to me – looking back it is like it happened to someone else. ‘But, now I really do think more about what I put in my body and I do think twice about drinking. ‘I just try to be happy – that is the main thing in life because you don’t know what is around the corner. ‘It gives you a massive wakeup call and now I try not to do things I don’t want to do but to focus on things that make me happy and that don’t make me stressed.’ For more information about bowel cancer, visit the Bowel Cancer UK website. More than 40,000 people are diagnosed with bowel cancer in the UK every year and it is the UK's second biggest cancer killer. About 15,700 people die of the disease every year in the UK - that is nearly one person every 30 minutes. If caught at its earliest stages, 93 per cent of patients will live for more than five years. However, in 91 per cent of patients it has spread further by the time it is diagnosed. A recent study by private health insurer AXA PPP healthcare revealed half of British people have ignored worrying symptoms such as lumps, pain or bleeding. It also showed that 48 per cent of men are unable to name a single symptom of bowel cancer. The research also revealed that one in three adults have turned down an invitation to take part in a screening programme and a third say they are too embarrassed to get checked. Dr Gary Bolger, AXA PPP healthcare’s chief medical officer, said: 'When dealing with bowel cancer you can’t underestimate the importance of early diagnosis. 'We need to increase people’s understanding of the disease and encourage them to see their GP if they show signs or symptoms of the disease.'

"By . Katie Nicholl, Mail On Sunday Royal Correspondent . There have been jousts, sieges, Royal audiences and endless State banquets. But never before in its 900-year history has Windsor Castle thrown open its gates to the million-watt razzmatazz of the world’s most successful fashion mogul. On Tuesday night, Windsor’s medieval halls and Georgian salons will be crammed with an astonishing gathering of Royalty, rock stars, Hollywood celebrities and wealthy philanthropists, invited to a star-studded party sponsored by American designer Ralph Lauren. Prince William will host the charity fundraiser, but without Kate, pictured here in a Lauren dress . Ready for razzmatazz: Windsor Castle is throwing open its gates to the world's most successful fashion mogul, Ralph Lauren and a host of celebrities . The event, hosted by Prince William, aims to raise awareness of London’s Royal Marsden cancer hospital – one of Princess Diana’s favourite charities. Guests will include supermodels Kate Moss and Cara Delevingne, Oscar-winning actress Cate Blanchett, Harry Potter heroine Emma Watson and Sherlock star Benedict Cumberbatch. It is expected that most of them will turn out in Ralph Lauren creations. Notable by her absence will be the Duchess of Cambridge, who reluctantly turned down an invitation to attend. She is a fan of Ralph Lauren, and has been seen in his blazers and dresses, but sources say she and William want to keep their charitable projects separate in order to spread their influence as wide as possible. William became president of the Royal Marsden Hospital in 2007 and is keen to enhance his philanthropic profile. Princess Diana, escorted by fashion designer Ralph Lauren during an event at the National Building Museum in Washington DC in 1996 . His backing for Mr Lauren’s connection with the Marsden will be seen as his picking up the baton from his mother – who was also the hospital’s president. The Duke, who is said to have personally asked the Queen for permission to host the gala dinner, is expected to give a brief welcome and address in which he will thank Mr Lauren for extending his philanthropic work to the Marsden. Mr Lauren is one of the world’s richest men. His company is the ‘Official Outfitter’ for the Wimbledon tennis championships and his personal association with William and the Marsden will see him take a further step into the upper reaches of British society. A source close to Mr Lauren said: ‘This is a big deal for him. To be teaming up with British Royalty puts the brand and the Lauren family on a different footing.’ An official spokesman for Mr Lauren said: ‘It’s a very important night. Mr Lauren has not met the Duke before and he is over the moon about it, and very excited.’ Guests at the party will include actress Cate Blanchett, pictured left at the film premiere of 'Babel' in 2006, and model Kate Moss, pictured right . Windsor's medieval halls and Georgian salons will be crammed with a gathering of Royalty, rock stars, Hollywood celebrities and wealthy philanthropists, invited to a star-studded party sponsored by American designer Ralph Lauren . The spokesman added: ‘He has spent a long time looking for the right cancer-related philanthropic mission. This is an opportunity to develop that work. ‘He had a special relationship with Diana and he is looking forward to meeting William.’ The 74-year-old fashion designer, who is also a global supporter of breast cancer research, rarely leaves America, but will fly to London with his wife Ricky, and their three children, David, Dylan and Andrew. David is married to Lauren Bush, the grand-daughter of former US President George Bush Snr and niece of George W Bush. After a three-course  dinner, singer Emeli Sande will serenade guests for the finale of the evening. Guests have been warned that security will be tight and have been asked to leave mobile phones and cameras at home.","Windsor Castle to host star-studded party sponsored by Ralph Lauren .

"By . Tim Shipman, Deputy Political Editor . Ed Miliband was accused of caving in to a ‘stitch-up’ by the Unite union yesterday as its candidates dominated the party’s list of  prospective MEPs. Candidates who are backed by Unite, have worked for Unite or are members of Unite secured the top slot in ten of the 11 regional lists of Labour candidates for the European elections next May. That means that the vast majority of the party’s representatives in Brussels will owe their success to the union, run by hard-Left firebrand Len McCluskey. Pressure: Labour leader Ed Miliband faces claims of a union 'stitch-up' after the party's list of candidates for next year's European elections was dominated by union-backed wannabe MEPs . Labour’s deputy leader Harriet Harman . boasted that the slate of almost 70 candidates ‘come from all walks of . life and from all different communities across the UK’. But two-thirds – 46 – have union links and 25 of those have ties to Unite. In every case where existing Labour . MEPs were standing down or Labour has no MEP – the most contentious . selections – a Unite candidate came top. They include Clare Moody, a . political officer for Unite, who was involved in the British Airways . strikes and had a desk in Downing Street under Gordon Brown. Links: Judith Kirton-Darling a former Unite official, and Labour MP for Birmingham ErdingtonSion Simon, who said he had always been a Unite member . Others are former Unite European officer Judith Kirton-Darling, and Unite member and former Labour MP Sion Simon. MEPs are elected on a list system, . with the number elected from each party’s list dependent on the . proportion of votes they receive in each region. That means that only . the candidates near the top of the list are likely to get elected. On its website the union claims that . after the 2009 poll ‘Unite now has eight MEPs in Brussels out of a total . of 13 UK Labour MEPs’. Number one: Unite national officer Clare Moody, who had a desk in Gordon Brown's Number 10, topped the list in the South West . The selections mean that if Labour . were to do as well next year as they did in 2009, the number of MEPs . linked to Unite would increase to 11 out of 13. And if Labour gains seats, as it might, in the South West and the West Midlands, Unite candidates would be the beneficiaries. The announcement fuelled controversy in the Labour Party that unions have forced out strong local candidates. Under Labour rules the candidates are . initially selected by a regional panel on which the unions and local . party bosses hold half the seats each. Only then do party members get a . chance to vote on where they would like them on the list. In the South West one candidate who . failed to get on the shortlist has accused Unite of imposing an . all-women shortlist to ensure the success of Clare Moody. She is ranked number one on the list ahead of former MEP Glyn Ford, who is also a Unite member. In London – where Unite-backed MEP . Claude Moraes is ranked number one – Anne Fairweather, who topped the . poll among London members in 2009, was not even allowed to stand by . Labour apparatchiks. Her treatment prompted Peter Watt, . Labour’s former general secretary, to complain: ‘The feeling is that as . she has a pro-business background she was blocked by the trade unions. It really is a stitch-up. ‘The regional panels are supposed to . be balanced between local parties and trade unions but in reality many . of the local party reps are really trade union placemen and women. 'So . many of the panels are pretty much controlled by the trade unions. Powerbase: How Unite boasts about have 'Unite's MEPs' including several standing for election in 2014 . ‘The trade unions have then used their power to select who they want and block those that they do not.’ Lord Mandelson has warned that trade unions wield an ‘absolutely disgraceful’ influence over the selection of candidates. A leaked Unite document earlier this . year boasted that the union was ‘working hard to ensure that good . progressive candidates are high on the list.’ Boast: Unite General Secretary Len McCluskey has pushed for more union influence over candidates . Judith Kirton-Darling tops the list in . the North East, while the top two selections in the West Midlands are . both Unite members, former MEP Neena Gill and Mr Simon. He is a close friend of Tom Watson, . the former Labour campaign co-ordinator who resigned amid claims that . Unite sought to stitch up a Parliamentary selection in Falkirk for his . office manager Karie Murphy, a close friend of Mr McCluskey. Mr Simon says on his website: ‘I was always a Unite MP, just as I have always been a Unite member.’ Only in the East Midlands where Glenis . Willmott MEP, a former GMB official, is top did Unite fail to secure . the top spot – and in that case Unite member Rory Palmer was second. Tory party chairman Grant Shapps said: . ‘While Ed Miliband hides away in his French bunker, Unite continues its . audacious takeover: they are buying Labour policies, pushing Ed . Miliband around, and today’s revelations show the top candidate in more . than 90 per cent of Labour’s MEP candidate lists is in Len McCluskey’s . pocket. ‘These candidates are former Gordon . Brown aides and strike-organisers. Even senior Labour sources are . calling it a “union stitch-up”. ‘It’s the same old Labour Party, and . if Ed Miliband cannot stand up to Len McCluskey, he’s too weak to stand . up for hardworking people.’ A Labour Party spokesman said: . ‘Labour’s European candidates were selected in a ballot of individual . party members – they, and they alone, made the choice.’","Claims of a union take-over despite pledge to water down union links .

"The business executive who executed his family before setting their rented home ablaze had not complained about any financial difficulties, his father-in-law said today. Darrin Campbell, 49, was found dead alongside his wife Kimberly and teenage children in a Florida mansion. The financial expert is believed to have systematically shot his family in the head with a .40-caliber handgun before starting the blaze at the home of former tennis star James Blake. His wife's devastated family spoke out as CCTV emerged of Campbell buying an 'exceedingly large' amount of fireworks and gas canisters in the days before the house went up in flames. Scroll down for audio and videos . Executed: Police revealed today that Darrin Campbell, left, shot wife, Kimberly, right, in the head with his .40-caliber handgun he bought last year. He killed his two children in the same way . 'Perfect': Kimberly's father told MailOnline that his daughter hadn't told him about any financial troubles that may have pushed him to breaking point. The Campbells had moved to the property two years ago to be nearer the private school Colin, 19, pictured left at prom and right on the baseball field, attended with his sister, Megan . Tragic: Megan, 16, pictured left and right, . attended Carrollwood day school. She had just won an award days before the murders. Friends as well as relatives have expressed utter shock over the killings . Shocked friends and family still coming to terms with the four deaths are mystified why Campbell would have gone on such a deadly rampage. 'I am hearing all the gory details and I can't believe it,' said Gordon Lambie, his father-in-law. 'Did he have financial worries? Not that I was aware of. I talk with my daughter all the time and she had never said anything before. 'All I know is that I have lost my family, my daughter, my grandchildren. It is all too much.' Mr Lambie, 84, who lives in Michigan, added that he was too frail to travel to Florida to find out more details. 'I am looking after my wife and have my own health problems. I can't believe what I am hearing.' Investigators are pouring over Campbell's bank accounts and financial records to see if they provide a clue to what pushed him over the edge. After almost 18 months out of work he landed a job six months ago as Chief Operating Officer of a digital storage company in Tampa. He had previously held senior positions with several south Florida companies but no longer for more than three years with any of them. Haunting video: A surveillance video has emerged showing Darrin Campbell dressed in a dark-grey T-shirt and shorts buying a pile of fireworks last Sunday . Evidence: The surveillance footage was recorded inside the store Phantom Fireworks . The firecrackers seen in Campbell's shopping cart in the video were reportedly used to start a fire in his home Wednesday . Business as usual: Store clerk Michael Muti (right) who handled the transaction Sunday recalled that Campbell seemed 'normal and chatty' Star rental: The Campbell's rented the home from tennis star James Blake, left. Campbell, right, had had a serious of high-profile and senior jobs in various industries. He had apparently been out of work for a year but had recently secured another good job six months ago as the COO of a digital storage company in Tampa . In many other previous murder-suicides financial or marital problems have been cited for the reason the killings taking place. Family members said Campbell and his 51 year old wife had a 'strong marriage'. Campbell's mother Mary said they had 'everything to live for' and were a perfect family. The investigation is likely to focus on Campbell's financial situation. Local realtors estimate Campbell would have been paying $6,000 a month to rent out the 5,000 sq ft home from former tennis star James Blake. The family moved into the rented home so that the children could be near to their private school after selling their previous $750,000 home for a profit. He also had school fees for son Colin,19, and daughter Megan,16, of more than $35,000 a year. At a press conference on Friday, Hillsborough County Sheriff's Col. Donna Lusczynski said the sheriff's office had not been investigating Campbell before the killings and did not know of any other agencies that may have been investigating him. Campbell had no criminal record before his death. Investigators confirmed they looking into the family's finances and going through records found in the home, Lusczynski said. but a search of public records shows no sign of financial strain on the family. Meanwhile, A surveillance video was released late Thursday showing Darrin Campbell dressed in a dark-grey T-shirt and shorts placing stacks of fireworks into a shopping cart at Phantom Fireworks. The firecrackers that Campbell bought reportedly surrounded . the bodies and apparently started the fire that engulfed the two-story, . five-bedroom home. Remains: This aerial photo shows the burned out home owned by James Blake on Thursday, May 8, a day after it was set alight . Sinister: Fireworks were found strewn around the house and police say an accelerant - probably the gas canisters he bought - were used to start the blaze . Fire: The blaze was so ferocious that firefighters could not get in to examine the grisly scene until the next day . The nine-minute silent clip depicts the married father of two emptying his full cart at the cash register.

"By . Charlie Lankston . When it comes to dealing with embarrassing little brothers, Prince William knows a thing or two – after suffering the headline grabbing antics of the party-loving Prince Harry. So he may well be dishing out some sage advice to his wife the Duchess of Cambridge about how to cope after this set of pictures emerged of her brother at play. The madcap snapshots prove that James Middleton, 26, has a wicked sense of fun that would no doubt appeal to Harry – but which may well have other members of the Royal Family, not least Kate, recoiling in horror. His 'n' hers: James Middleton, pictured left with sister Kate, is on his best behaviour in a smart jacket as he attends a function, but, right, is transformed in a navy-blue polka-dot dress for a party at Edinburgh University .

One picture shows James looking the worse for wear in the ski resort of Tignes, apparently dozing on a nightclub pole. Another sees him at a freshers’ party at Edinburgh University striking a pose in a navy-blue polka-dot dress that could almost have been taken straight out of Kate’s wardrobe. Most of the pictures demonstrate James’s love of action and the outdoors, a fondness shared by Kate and their sister Pippa. And he is clearly not shy, as  the snaps of him emerging from the sea prove. Pole position: James is in need of a little support, left, during a holiday in the French ski resort of Tignes.

In times gone by, the photographs may have been seen as immensely compromising for a Royal in-law, yet like all well-connected young people these days, James has lived most of his adult life through the lens of social media websites such as Facebook, where images of parties, holidays – and embarrassing moments – are stored and freely shared. But are James’s carefree days already over? He is dating socialite Donna Air, 34, who has a daughter, and friends say that he has matured rapidly and is focusing hard on making a success of his baking company, Nice Cakes. At least Kate knows that her brother can be  relied upon to behave in a totally respectable and mature way when needed – he performed a perfect Bible reading at her wedding in 2011.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . A senior Labour MP today launched a devastating attack on party leader Ed Miliband’s faltering leadership. Former minister George Mudie broke ranks to accuse his leader of failing to set the agenda and raised serious doubts about the party's hopes of winning the general election. He added that he had no idea what Labour’s policy was on vote-winning areas including, education, welfare and the NHS. Trouble at the top: Labour leader Ed Miliband is under pressure to make a bigger impact . Mr Mudie’s decision to speak out publicly echoes growing private concerns at senior levels of the party that Labour is failing to make an impact on voters. In one poll this week Labour was just three points ahead of the Tories, a lead which Mr Mudie might not ‘withstand’ a major battle during the general election campaign. Questions have also been raised about why the party has failed to capitalise on David Cameron and Nick Clegg going on holiday at the start of the summer recess. In a devastating interview Mr Mudie said he was ‘deeply worried’ about the Opposition's prospects at the general election, admitting that he did not know its policy on welfare or education. Mr Mudie, who was one of the first MPs to call for Tony Blair to quit, said Mr Miliband is 'always cocooned' by people around him and suffers from a 'bunker mentality'. He also suffered from being 'young', the battle to defeat his brother David in the leadership election and the influence of trade unions. The former education minister told BBC Radio 4’s World at One: ‘I have difficulty knowing what we stand for now. ‘We are 18 months away from an . election thinking that we will put out a document on all these major . items and the public will say “Oh great”. ‘At the moment, the Government are setting the agenda, making the weather and we're responding to it.’ He warned the last two Labour leaders did a better job of dominating the political landscape. ‘Tony Blair and Gordon Brown never did that... We're not setting any agenda, we're responding to the Tories.’ Mr . Mudie, a close ally of Mr Brown, said to get back into power Labour had . to ‘demonstrate to people that we are relevant to their lives’. If the party was not ‘offering something different’ people would ‘stick with what they have got’, he warned. ‘There . has to be and there is some concern that the lead we have in the polls, . first of all is not firm enough, big enough,’ he added. ‘Will it withstand a general election discussion? Worried: Labour MP George Mudie attacked Mr Miliband's for the party's confused stance on key issues . ‘But the real thing is, do you know, because I don't, know our position on welfare, do you know our position on education, do you know our genuine position on how we'd run the health service? ‘If you're not getting a clear enough message to me, and to some of my colleagues, what are you, what kind of message do you think you're putting out there? ‘I remember before we won, 1992, the five years to 1997, this place was bubbling, we were energetic, we were at them, we thought we had all the answers. ‘We're not at them and we're slightly hesitant and we're slightly confused and I deeply worry about that.’ Sadiq Khan, Labour's shadow justice secretary, hit back insiting Mr Miliband had been doing 'heavy lifting' to prepare for government. He told the BBC: 'We haven’t got the luxury that George had between ’92 and ’97 of being out of power for 18 years. 'That means learning the lessons, but doing the heavy lifting. And what you’re right to remind me of, is in two and a half years, as a new leader - you’re not the Prime Minister - you need to make an impression on the British public pretty swiftly. 'And that’s what we’re seeking to do by setting the agenda.' But Conservative Party Chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘This is all starting to sound very familiar. ‘Ed Miliband offers weak and directionless leadership to an increasingly restless Labour Party. ‘If he is too weak to  control his own party or stand-up to union barons, how can he possibly stand-up for the hardworking people of Britain? As the senior and respected Labour MP George Mudie says himself, ‘why would you vote Labour?”’","Ex-minister George Mudie says no-one knows what the party's policies are .

"By . Simon Walters . Speaking out: Four years into his premiership, Mr Cameron has spoken for the first time about his darkest moments, distant memories and preference for trash TV . It is an issue which can bring even the happiest couple close to blows: who controls the television remote control. And it is no different when David Cameron and his wife Samantha sit down in front of the box in their Downing Street flat. He has revealed that he does what millions of men do: grabs hold of the remote and channel hops from one ‘rubbish’ programme to another. And Mrs Cameron does what millions of women married to such men do: stomps off in exasperation. In one of his most candid and intimate interviews since becoming Prime Minister, Mr Cameron has told The Mail on Sunday that: . In the interview with Mail on Sunday Editor Geordie Greig, Mr Cameron confesses to the ‘annoying male habit of channel-surfing’ on the TV. ‘I watch a lot of rubbish,’ he admits. ‘I love murder mysteries and things like that on a Sunday night to escape from it all.’ Asked who controls the remote, him or Samantha, he pleaded guilty: ‘I drive her mad because I sometimes watch more than one thing at a time, and then she’ll leave the room.’ However, Mr Cameron is rather more strict when it comes to what his three children, Nancy, six, Elwen, seven and Florence, three, do for entertainment. Off duty: The Prime Minister with his family including Ivan, left, who died in 2009. Mr Cameron blasts those who try to search for a 'silver lining' to the tragedy that shook his family in the year before the last election . They are banned from having video games, mobile phones or tablets (though they are allowed to use their parents’ iPads ‘from time to time’) and on weekend mornings are banned from watching TV. ‘I try to get them away from the Disney channels to watch nature programmes,’ he said. ‘We try to limit screen time. We have rules. At the weekend: no television in the morning. We don’t do morning TV – they should be doing something.’ The rules seem to be working. He says Elwen ‘plays a lot of football and rugby’ and had tried his hand at DJing at a friend’s party, while Nancy was taking part in ‘an amateur opera.’ Similarly, traditionalist Mr Cameron has avoided telling them about ‘twerking,’ the provocative dance made famous by pop star Miley Cyrus, who previously starred in the children’s TV series Hannah Montana. Traditionalist: Mr Cameron revealed he refuses to give his children mobile phones or music and video gaming devices. He will also try his best to keep them from discovering what 'twerking' means . ‘My children are too young. Luckily they haven’t connected this lovely Hannah Montana, who is now this person twerking.’ But . he may be fighting a losing battle: they have already noticed swearing . in pop songs. ‘They say, “Daddy, that’s the bad this or that word.” They . are very conscious of that and they don’t approve of swearing. ‘They are quite right – the artists are wrong to swear, although I can’t say I totally live by those rules myself.’ The Prime Minister reflects more sombrely on the deaths of his father Donald in 2010 and his disabled son Ivan in 2009, venting his frustration with those who told him ‘some good’ could come out of such a tragedy. Talent: Cameron, seen eating breakfast at Camp Bastion, also revealed he played the drums at Eton . ‘Even though Ivan was very disabled and very ill, it was all just a total shock. We had no idea he was going to suddenly die in the way he did,’ he said. ‘But the person who says to you, “There’s a silver lining to all this,” or “Some good will come of all this,” you actually want to thump. ‘It’s the most annoying thing anybody can possibly say.’ Reflecting on his own childhood, Mr Cameron praised his favourite teacher at Eton, the ‘wonderful’ Michael Kitson who ‘woke me up to the excitement of history’ And he revealed a modest, musical talent: he had played the drums in a school band – and ‘once stood in for someone in a jazz band, for one night only’. He also talked about his religious beliefs, saying: ‘I’m a classic Church of England member, but part of its strength is the fact that it doesn’t ask us to sign up to too much of a canon...but I’ve always found the teachings of Jesus and the Bible quite useful as a sort of handy guide. ‘But there are plenty of other guides you could use. I find this one works for me.’ David Cameron has taken a swipe at Jeremy Paxman following his claims that the Prime Minister was a ‘complete idiot’ for the way he plans to mark the centenary of the First World War. The Newsnight host has said he is ‘troubled’ over Mr Cameron’s plans to ‘celebrate such a calamity’  – and has denounced Education Secretary Michael Gove for calling the conflict ‘just’. Now Mr Cameron has criticised Mr Paxman’s book on British history, saying he preferred a work by Jan Morris, which salutes our military victories. Conflict: David Cameron's plans to mark the centenary of World War One were branded 'idiotic' by Jeremy Paxman. But he has hit back by dismissing the Newsnight presenter's book, Great Britain's Great War . And in his interview with Mail on Sunday Editor Geordie Greig, the Prime Minister used near-identical language to his political and personal confidant, Mr Gove to describe the First World War. Mr Cameron said: ‘We should be clear that World War I was a war fought in a just cause, that our ancestors thought it would be bad to have a Prussian-dominated Europe, and that is why they fought. ‘One can read the poems of Wilfred Owen and find them extremely moving but still understand why Britain went to war in 1914 and what the consequences would have been had we not.’ Mr Paxman – whose latest  book Great Britain’s Great War describes the conflict as the point where Britons realised their future ‘would never be as grand as their past’ – criticised the description, ‘a just war’ when Mr Gove used it, saying: ‘I’m not sure it’s a helpful phrase.’ Mr Cameron, who for Christmas gave each of his eight godchildren a copy of Robert Graves’s ‘brilliant’ war book Goodbye To All That, was speaking two weeks before Mr Gove rounded on Left-wing academics for using fictions such as Blackadder to ‘feed the myth’ that WW1 was ‘unpatriotic’ and  a ‘misbegotten shambles’. His words came weeks before Michael Gove attacked Left-wing academics and Blackadder for 'feeding a myth' Mr Cameron has another dig at Mr Paxman when he says said he had recently read two books on the Empire: one by Jan Morris and one by Mr Paxman. ‘Jan Morris’ book was much better,’ he said, bluntly. It is the latest exchange in a war of words between both Tory politicians and Mr Paxman that stretches back nearly a decade. The tension was most obvious in a 2010 interview when Mr Paxman asked Mr Cameron six times if  he would raise VAT, and sneered: ‘People look at you and George Osborne and see two immensely privileged young men with a glint in their eye.’ Gig: The Prime Minister and his wife Samantha recently 'sneaked' into a concert at Shepherd's Bush Empire to see Scandinavian sisters Johanna and Klara Soderberg as First Aid Kit . The Prime Minister has revealed how he and his wife Samantha recently ‘sneaked’ into a concert by an obscure Swedish folk duo. And he admitted it wasn’t the first time they had joined the audience at the Shepherd’s Bush Empire in London. ‘There’s quite a good way of sneaking in there,’ he said. The latest visit was to see Scandinavian sisters Johanna and Klara Söderberg, pictured left, who perform as First Aid Kit. Mr Cameron, who has previously claimed to be a fan of rock bands The Smiths and Coldplay, says in today’s Event magazine: ‘I’ve got into a bit of a countryish thing.’ First Aid Kit, whose sound is defined by melancholic harmonies and wistful lyrics, have yet to break into the mainstream – although they have gained a significant following online, attracting more than four million YouTube views. Aptly for their new fan, their tracks include one titled Blue – although it’s a downbeat number about a depressed woman mourning the death of the only man she ever loved and unlikely ever to be adopted as a party anthem. Samantha Cameron is also a fan – once telling fellow musicians Mumford and Sons about their work. Johanna and Klara Söderberg – 23 and 21 respectively –  come from the Stockholm suburb of Enskede and say their music is influenced by their activism on issues including environmentalism, Guantanamo Bay and the ultimately successful campaign to free Russian punk band Pussy Riot. David Cameron’s music tastes have come under fire from some musicians, with The Smiths’ Johnny Marr even ‘forbidding’ him from listening to their songs. But the PM insists The Smiths are still played regularly at home.","Traditionalist Cameron banned children from phones and weekend TV .

"By . Steph Cockroft . Hollywood smile: The Duchess of Cambridge opted for orthodontic 'micro-rotations' to give her the perfect smile . The old saying goes that you're never fully dressed without a smile. But it now seems it's not so much about the smile as the teeth beneath it. According to a top social scientist, where we now stand in society is becoming increasingly dependent not on our education or our upbringing - but on the state of our gnashers. Malcolm Gladwell, the writer behind David and Goliath, says teeth are becoming the new benchmark of inequality. According to the writer, those with bad teeth are also given a lower chance of success - because they are 'denied' certain 'entry-level' jobs. He told the Times: 'That's kind of the way we're moving as the gap between the fit and the . unfit grows. 'The teeth thing and the obesity problems are the same: they . are symptoms of the same set of inferences that are being drawn. 'I think those kinds of physical characteristics - that's completely the next wave of discrimination.' The comments follow an increasing trend of celebrities and reality TV stars paying to have work done to their teeth. The range of work includes tooth whitening using bleach, veneers and even implants in which titanium spikes are put into a person's jaw. Experts fear that while those with  money can pay to . give themselves sparkling Hollywood smiles, those from poorer . backgrounds can not afford to give their teeth the same treatment. Results from the Government's Health and Social Care . Information Centre also seem to back up Mr Gladwell's comments. Victoria Beckham is just one of a number of celebrities who had work on their teeth once they were famous . Statistics from the centre show one fifth of hospital admissions for . dental treatments in 2011 were for patients from the most deprived 10 per cent of . the population in England. The . figures also show that there were three times as many patients aged . between 0 and 29 having treatment than those aged over 60 - when teeth . are traditionally in worse decline. A poll conducted last year by VisionCritical also found that people see whiter teeth as an indication of wealth. The survey showed that people with whiter teeth were thought to earn £10,000 more on average than they actually did. Sparkling . teeth also made them look up to five years younger and improved their . employment potential by 10 per cent, results showed. Eddie Crouch from the British Dental Association also told the paper there was also a noticeable gap between middle-class teenagers able to afford to have braces fitted while those from deprived areas could not get the same treatment. He said: 'Huge numbers of those kids that are referred to us from socially-deprived areas can't have the treatment they need because their overall standard of dental health is too poor.'","Social scientist Malcolm Gladwell says bad teeth can hamper social mobility .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . 'Firestorm': Birmingham City Council CEO Mark Rogers predicted a 'serious' response from Ofsted's forthcoming report . Schools in Birmingham under investigation for their involvement into an alleged 'Trojan Horse' plot to force religious extremism into children's education have been warned to expect a 'bloody firestorm'. Headteachers from the schools affected by simultaneous investigations from Ofsted, Birmingham City Council, and the Department for Education were warned by the local authority that a forthcoming report would have 'serious implications' for the schools in question. The chief executive of Birmingham City Council told those present that the investigation - prompted by allegations of an extremist Islamic takeover in the city's schools - that the Government would use a forthcoming report as a stick to beat them with. Mark Rogers said: 'In early June that [Ofsted] report is made, published in the public domain and some kind of bloody firestorm will occur. 'The Secretary of State's [Michael Gove's] response will then repeat that firestorm as he decides what to do about that report'. In the recording, acquired by the Telegraph, he went on to say the document will have 'serious implications for all of us', implying that the Government could intervene over the way the investigated schools - a mixture of academies and council-run schools - are run. He added: 'We're not stupid - we know that this might provide a platform for the Secretary of State to put some further structural proposals on the city council'. According to the newspaper, Mr Rogers went on to criticise the head of Ofsted, whom he said would deliberately focus on radicalisation and extremism in schools. Under investigation: Park View school, pictured above, is being investigated over the plot - which headteachers fear could spread . The Bradford Muslim Education Forum has run events involving alleged Birmingham plotter Tahir Alam, who heads the governing body at the city's Park View school . He also attacked Education Secretary Michael Gove, saying he did not expect his 'firestorm' response to be 'moderate and considered'. However, the meeting heard that the council's own investigation had so far not discovered any evidence of extremism. The recording comes a week after the headmasters' union said that 'concerted efforts' had been made to infiltrate the Birmingham schools - which could even spread to other cities. The general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers said some teachers were being appointed because of their Muslim faith rather than their skills. There was also evidence of ‘pressure’ being brought to bear on heads to adopt ‘certain philosophies and approaches’. Inquiry: On Wednesday, the names of 18 schools at the centre of the alleged 'Trojan Horse' plot were revealed in a list by Birmingham City Council. Above, one of the schools, Gracelands Nursery School in Sparkbrook . Under investigation: The allegations came to light earlier this year. Above, Adderley Primary School in Saltley . Speaking ahead of the union’s annual conference in Birmingham, he said: ‘We ourselves have concerns about what has been going on in and around half a dozen of those schools. ‘There have been things going on inside our schools which would make some of us feel uncomfortable.’ Meanwhile, it was claimed that dozens of teachers pushed out of schools by an alleged Islamist takeover plot are too afraid to speak out because of gagging orders. Birmingham MP Khalid Mahmood said at least ten teachers told him they were made to sign agreements offering cash in return for their silence. Ofsted is now inspecting 21 schools over the plot - whereby Muslim extremists infiltrate state schools and run them according to Islamic principles. Birmingham City Council is also investigating 25 schools. A spokesman for the council said it could not comment while the investigations were taking place.","Meeting of headteachers was told there would be 'serious implications'

It is predicted that there could be a miniature Lego figure for every person on Earth in 2019. According to a mathematical online comic, Lego has been making its little people at such a rate that they will outnumber the human population by the end of the decade. At the end of 2006, the company announced there were four billion miniature figures in existence, being played with by children across the planet. A physics graduate from Massachusetts, who is behind the web comic Xkcd.com has calculated that the predictions for the global population and predictions for the number of Lego Figurines will match up in 2019 and the plastic people will go on to out-number humans. If the predictions are correct, there will be almost eight billion people and the same amount of Lego figures calling Earth home in 2019. Lego said in 2008 that it has made 400 billion Lego bricks since the company began, which is enough for 62 each for every person in existence at that time. The first Lego figurine went on sale in 1978 and since then, billions have been produced, making them the world's biggest population group, according to the company.","The Chrome app is designed to be played on Android smartphones, tablets and computers .

"By . Steve Robson . Spared prison: Ayan Hadi, the wife of white Muslim convert Richard Dart, admitted failing to give police information about his terrorist plot . The wife of white Muslim convert Richard Dart who was jailed for terrorism offences has admitted failing to provide information that might have helped police arrest and prosecute him. Ayan Hadi, 31, pleaded guilty to the offence at the Old Bailey today. Her husband Richard Dart was jailed for six years in April with two co-conspirators Jahangir Alom and Imran Mahmood for planning acts of terrorism. Hadi was also arrested and charged at the time for failing to disclose information which might have led to his prosecution. But . she was pregnant during her first appearance at court and her lawyer . said any trial hearing would have to take her due date into account. Dart's brother Robb Leech, who first . brought the convert's views into the . spotlight in his television documentary My Brother The Islamist, . revealed that Hadi gave birth to a baby girl weeks before he was . sentenced.

'Now . healthy with a life full of possibilities ahead of her, she will need a . father and someone to guide her through the world. My only hope is that . when Rich gets out, his little daughter will be his calling.' Today Hadi, from Acton, west . London, pleaded guilty to withholding information about her husband and . will be sentenced on August 16. Mr Justice Sweeney warned that she could also be jailed. He told her: 'All sentencing options remain firmly open.' Former BBC security guard Dart refused . to stand when he was sentenced in April, saying: 'I don’t wish to stand up. I . believe ruling and judging is only for Allah.' The . court heard that Dart and Alom travelled to Pakistan to try to get . terrorist training, and took advice from Mahmood, who had already . visited the country. Dart, a . son of teachers, also discussed bomb-making with Mahmood, and military . repatriation town Wootton Bassett as a potential target. Jailed: Richard Dart was sentenced to six years in prison for planning acts of terrorism in April . Police . discovered fragments of text on his laptop that revealed that the pair . had used the computer to have a 'silent conversation' to avoid possible . surveillance bugs - opening a Word document and taking it in turns to . type, then deleting the text.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Nick Clegg has been challenged by his own party to ‘shame’ Tories and Labour into ending grubby party funding deals with big donors. The Lib Dem leader is warned not to ‘bottle’ the chance to reform rules on how political parties raise millions from wealthy businessmen and union barons. But Mr Clegg is expected to repeat his call to Ed Miliband and David Cameron to return to the negotiating table to return public trust the party politics. Pressure: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said it was up to the Conservatives and Lib Dems to return to the negotiating table to overhaul party funding . Talks on overhauling donations have . repeatedly collapsed, but the latest round of donors given seats in the . House of Lords has reignited calls for an end to the perception that . honours are traded in exchange for cash. Mr Clegg, along with David Clegg and Ed Miliband, was accused of 'polluting Parliament' by giving party donors seats in the House of Lords as a slate of 30 new peers was unveiled. The list of 14 new Tory peers included big money donor and JCB boss Sir Anthony Bamford, whose family has given some £2.5million to the Tories, and Conservative treasurer Howard Leigh who has given £37,682 since 2011. Mr Clegg appointed 10 new Lib Dem peers, including major donor James Palumbo, founder of the Ministry of Sound nightclub, who has boosted party coffers by almost £700,000 including £80,000 since the start of this year. Another Lib Dem donor becoming a peer, Rumi Verjee, has given the party £770,000 since May 2010. He becomes Lord Verjee. Today Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott called on Mr Clegg to stop the next election being bought with ‘dirty money’. Bottle: Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott urged his leader to act on removing 'dirty money' from politics . He said the Deputy PM should not give . the Tories a veto on the issue, claiming there is a House of Commons . majority in favour of reforming party funding. Lord Oakeshott told BBC Radio 4's . Today programme that he wanted to see a £5,000 cap on political . donations and tougher rules around election campaign spending. In a direct challenged to his party leader, Lord Oakeshott said: 'I am now saying: Nick - you are in charge, show some leadership, don't bottle out. You, Nick, are in charge of party funding and frankly we do not need agreement from all three parties to do it. ‘There's a long history of this, we've been quite close to agreement, and the Conservatives have vetoed it. ‘The reason is the Conservatives have the big money. Labour at last are facing up to it, Ed MIliband is actually being brave taking on the unions. ‘There is a majority in this House of Commons, I'm sure, for party funding reform but we cannot afford to give the Conservatives a veto on it, as indeed with the House of Lords reforms. ‘Nick Clegg has been very firm in the past and the recent past on it so now, Nick, this is your chance. Liberal Democrats who are appalled, all of us, by this behaviour, we're now saying to you, Nick, please take a lead, call in the other two parties, talk to them about it and shame people into doing it. ‘We still have 18 months to go, we can stop the next election being bought with dirty money as previous elections have been.’ Peerages: Former Labour fundraiser Jon Mendelsohn (left), a lobbyist who co-founded firm LLM Communications, and Ministry of Sound founder and Lib Dem donor James Palumbo are to join the Lords . Donations: Tory donors Howard Leigh (left) and JCB boss Sir Anthony Bamford have been given peerages . Last month Mr Clegg revealed that the latest attempt to reform party funding had stalled without agreement. Tories refuse to back curbs on big money donations while individual. But in recent weeks Labour leader Mr Miliband has moved to suggest he will water down his party’s links with the unions, risking up to 90 per cent of the levies paid by millions of members. A source close to Nick Clegg said: 'Lord Oakeshott is quite right to say that the whole way political parties are funded needs top-to-bottom reform. 'Nobody has tried harder than Liberal Democrats in Government to make this happen but, as so often before, the vested interests in both the Labour and Conservative parties have scuppered reform. 'A cross-party deal has always improved impossible because Labour would not give up their union funding; and the Tories would not give up big donations. 'If Labour and the Conservatives are serious about reform, we would be the first round the table because we remain convinced that all parties, including our own, need to change the way that they are paid for in order to restore public faith in politics.' Yesterday Mr Clegg blamed Labour and the Conservatives for blocking attempts to reform the House of Lords. Speaking on his radio phone-in, he said: ‘I would be delighted to not be sitting here not talking about appointments at all, if only the Labour and Conservatives had let you and everybody else listening to this show have a say on who goes into the House of Lords. ‘I think the whole thing should be scrapped and we should have an elected House of Lords. ‘But given we don’t I am appointing  people who I think will be good Liberal Democrat peers, sharing the values of my party in the House of Lords,’ he told LBC 97.3.","Party leaders face claims of trading honours for millions in donations .

"By . Helen Pow . Toronto mayor Rob Ford has declared 'rehab is amazing' and that it reminds him of 'football camp' as he vows to return fighting fit to 'kick butt' in October's election. The embattled mayor, who is on a leave of absence to tackle his drug and alcohol use, said he feels 'great' and is benefiting from the self-imposed exile. There are meetings with 'eight people in a group,' he told the Toronto Sun from his mystery treatment center Tuesday. And later 'there is a meal before we have some one-on-one sessions.' 'It reminds me of football camp. Kind of like the Washington Redskins camp I went to as a kid,' he said, adding 'I am working out every day and I am learning about myself, my past and things like that.' Where are you? Rob Ford is pictured above on May 1, a day after he announced his leave of absence. He has now spoken out about rehab, calling it the best thing he ever did . There's no timeline for his return to office, but Ford has assured his supporters he'll be back in time to gain re-election later this year. 'Of course, I am coming back and I am going to kick butt,' he told the newspaper. 'I will be on the ballot for mayor in October, guaranteed, and I will do well.' He joked 'on October 28 there will be no need to change the locks. There will be no need to clean out my office because I am coming back.' Ford said the rehab center treats 'addictions to alcohol and other things' and is 'worth every penny.' After a week of being clean and sober, the mayor said he's starting to come to terms with what has happened over the past year but he said he is hopeful he can right his wrongs. 'At first, I was mad. I was mad at myself and saying, ""Why me?""' he told the Sun. 'But then I realized it could have been a whole lot worse.' He said the very public fall from grace was possibly what he needed to shake him into action. 'I do feel bad about what happened, but it might have been the best thing that happened because I am working on getting better.' Getting help: The mayor is seeking treatment for alcohol addition. Pictured above arriving at his home early Thursday morning after announcing his leave of absence . Ford refused to reveal the name of the treatment center he's checked into, out of respect for the other patients, and he wouldn't even confirm it was in Canada. He said the decision to check himself into rehab came on April 29 - the morning after he was taped in an apparent intoxicated state at a city pub. He said he woke up and 'I told Dougie, ""I am going away"" and then started looking up rehab and treatment centres.' Ford told the Sun his family knows where he is and he's been speaking to his children regularly, though they don't know why he's getting help. He said the past week has been tough but he described going into rehab as the 'best decision' he has ever made and said he wishes he'd done it sooner. 'I said to myself, ""Am I going to try to cover it up for the rest of your life or deal with it and go to professional help?""' Ford recalled. 'I decided to get help.' The media has been speculating as to the crack-smoking mayor's whereabouts since he announced his leave of absence last Wednesday. He reportedly got on a private plane bound for Chicago but he was turned away at the border, the Globe and Mail reported. Neither . Ford's brother Doug Ford or his lawyer Dennis Morris will say where exactly the mayor is, but insisted Tuesday he is seeking treatment as . promised. Ford was last seen leaving his house the morning of May 1 to board a private plane at Buttonville Municipal Airport. He landed in Chicago but never formally entered the U.S. Back to drugs: Ford's announcement follows the emergence of yet another video showing him smoking what appears to be crack. A still from the new video released by the Globe and Mail, above . 'He . voluntarily withdrew his application to enter the USA,' Ray Norton, . Canada's Consul General in Chicago, told the Globe and Mail. Norton . added that Ford 'was not declined entry, per se'. Norton didn't learn about the incident until after the fact, when he was notified by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol. CBP . spokesman Kris Grogan wouldn't comment on Ford's application, because . of the privacy act, but pointed out that foreigners attempting to enter . the U.S. can be barred on the grounds of 'criminality, security reasons . and documentations, among dozens of others'. Morris wouldn't comment on where the plane went after Chicago, since he wasn't on board. He maintains that Ford is in rehab, but when asked where, Morris said: 'I think it is close to Timbuktu.' 'The . bottom line is he's in rehab, he's getting rehab and he'll be there for . a number of weeks - and that's the answer. It's not like he's at a . baseball game in Los Angeles or something,' Morris said. Doug Ford wouldn't even say which country he was in. He previously announced that Ford was seeking treatment at one of the best facilities in North America. 'The most important thing, everyone who is concerned if he's in rehab, the answer is yes. As for his whereabouts that's personal and that should stay with Rob,' Doug Ford said. But that's not enough for politicians in Toronto, who are demanding answers for Ford's whereabouts. Infamous: Since the original crack video scandal, Ford has been the center of scandal after scandal. Pictured at a news conference with wife Renata (left) on November 14 . 'The mayor should explain where he's . going to be and how long he anticipates being there,' Councillor Giorgio . Mammoliti told the National Post. 'I think everybody will leave him alone if he does that.' 'Right . now nobody in this city believes him and trusts him on any of this. If a . plane landed and he didn't get off, he better tell this city where he . is going for treatment.' While the U.S. has barred foreigners from entering the U.S. before for noted drug use, such as when celebrity chef Nigella Lawson wasn't allowed to enter from the UK because she admitted to taking cocaine in a court case, Ford was allowed into the country as recently as March for an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live. But that was before news broke of yet another tape in which the mayor appears to be smoking crack-cocaine. The same day Ford announced his leave of absence, the Globe and Mail published screen grabs of a new video which shows Ford smoking the illegal drug at his sister's house on April 26. Ford made headlines last year when another group in Toronto was trying to sell a different video of Ford smoking crack, and he refused to step down. The new video also corresponded to reports that Ford got drunk at a Toronto bar Sullie Gorman's on April 28, making lewd comments about mayoral competition Karen Stintz.

"By . Sam Webb . The original pencil drawings for the prototypes of the temporary mobile ports - the Mulberry harbours - which played a crucial role in the D-Day landings in 1944 are to be sold at auction. The secret wartime plans, designed and drawn by the Welsh engineer Hugh Iorys Hughes in 1942, are being offered by an anonymous American collector and are expected to raise between £40,000 and £60,000 at the Second World War sale at Bonhams in New York on June 5. The makeshift harbour was one of the greatest military achievements of all time and its development was even described by Albert Speer - Hitler's architect and armaments minister - as 'genius'. The original plans for the Mulberry harbour invention that allowed the Allied invasion of France on D-Day are expected to fetch £60,000 at auction. They were designed by Welsh engineer Hugh Iorys Hughes . Hughes came up with the earliest prototypes. His plans were drawn up during an intensive seven-week period, from June 17 to August 6, 1942 - two years before D-Day . The makeshift harbours in action during the Normandy landings in June 1944. They enabled the Allies to land troops, vehicles and equipment on French soil without having to capture a port first . The Mulberrys were a response to the need of the Allies to find a port large enough to accommodate the huge amount of supplies required to support an invasion of mainland Europe. A Bonhams spokesman said: 'Aware that capturing an existing port in France was next to impossible, Hughes first proposed the idea of floating harbours to the War Office during 1941. 'His brother, a Royal Navy commander, brought the idea to the attention of senior staff and by that route to Winston Churchill. 'The Prime Minister was favourably inclined to the idea having proposed something similar as a member of the war cabinet during the First World War.' In May 1942 - fully two years before the D-Day landings - Churchill issued a directive to Admiral Mountbatten: 'Piers for use on beaches. They must float up and down with the tide. 'The anchor problem must be mastered. Let me have the best solution worked out. Don’t argue the matter. The difficulties will argue for themselves.' A Bonhams spokesman said: 'These documents contain the origins of the simple but devastatingly effective idea which transformed the Allied invasion of Europe in 1944. It took over two years to turn the concept first into plans and then into prototypes which, under conditions of great secrecy, could be rigorously tested' Hughes devised two types of device, codenamed 'Hippos' (concrete caissons that could be anchored in as pierheads) and 'Crocs' (steel roadways linking them together) The . spokesman added: 'The Mulberry harbours made possible the initial . landings at Normandy and the continued supply of troops during the . Allied invasion that turned the tide of the war. The enemy’s perspective . on their value is especially revealing. 'At . the Nuremberg Trials, Albert Speer, former Nazi minister of armaments, . was forced to admit that the Germans’ costly, two-year effort to . construct Atlantic defences had been ""brought to nothing because of an . idea of simple genius"".' Hugh Iorys Hughes was chosen to head the project and the plans going on sale, drawn up between June and August 1942, are the basis of what eventually became the Mulberry harbours deployed in May 1944 in time for the June invasion of France. The documents are Hughes’ own retained 1:44 scale copies, described by him as ‘proposed landing jetties’. Albert Speer (right, pictured here with Adolf Hitler) was forced to admit that the Germans¿ costly, two-year effort to construct Atlantic defences had been ""brought to nothing because of an idea of simple genius""' Remains of Mulberry Harbour B at Arromanches (Gold beach) in Normandy, used by the British and Canadians during WW2 . The plans drawn up over seven weeks and were finished by August 6th, 1942. The project test near Hughes’ home town of Conwy in North Wales was so secret almost a thousand men working on it were unaware of its true purpose. The finished prototypes were subsequently towed to . another secret test site in south-west Scotland. There, Hughes’ efforts . were integrated with prototypes developed by two other teams. The . work at Garlieston, Wigtownshire in Scotland included development and . testing of breakwaters, the idea for which came from engineer Robert . Lochner. He had noticed while having a bath that when he made waves on one side of the flannel, on the other side the waters were calm. The Mulberry harbours were completed by May 1944 and successfully launched with the use of tug boats soon after. Their purpose was to ease and speed up the unloading process so that Allied troops were supplied as they advanced across France. They were, as Churchill later wrote, 'to form a principal part of the great plan'. Each of the two artificial harbours was made up of about six miles of flexible steel roadways that floated on steel or concrete pontoons. The roadways were codenamed 'Whales' and the pontoons 'Beetles'. The ‘Whales’ ended at giant pier heads that had legs that rested on the seabed. The whole structure was protected from the force of the sea by scuttled ships, sunken caissons (a type of pump used in marine engineering) and a line of floating breakwaters. They were comprised of a staggering amount of material - 144,000 tonnes of concrete, 85,000 tonnes of ballast and 105,000 tonnes of steel. During D-Day operations, Mulberry A was installed at Omaha Beach, for American invasion forces, while Mulberry B was set up at Arromanches (Gold Beach) for the British and Canadians.Only two weeks after D-Day, a massive storm destroyed Mulberry A. Mulberry B also sustained some damage, but was reinforced to keep it operable at least until the end of October. Mulberry B was left open until November 19 and Hughes was involved throughout, making adjustments and reinforcements. In that time this harbour landed 2.5million men, 500,000 vehicles and four million tonnes of goods.","Mulberry harbours were floating ports that allowed mass troop landings in the aftermath of D-Day .

Louis van Gaal is set to be confirmed as Manchester United’s manager on Wednesday and will bring his extensive Dutch backroom staff with him to Old Trafford. The 62-year-old will be joined at United by former Holland striker Patrick Kluivert, goalkeeping coach Frans Hoek, fitness coach Jos van Dijk and analyst Max Reekers. However, their arrival means the club’s famous Class of 92 face uncertain futures. The roles for interim manager Ryan Giggs and coaches Nicky Butt, Paul Scholes and Phil Neville are up in the air, and they may be forced to take on junior roles or - in the worst-case scenario - move on altogether. New boss: Louis Van Gaal will be appointed as Manchester United manager next week . Undecided: Ryan Giggs and the Class of '92's role next season is not yet known . It is expected that Van Gaal’s appointment will be announced after United have played their final home game of the season against Hull on Tuesday night. Giggs has helped provide stability in the 10 days since David Moyes’s sacking; he has impressed with how he has handled the role of caretaker manager and thrived with the responsibility but it is unclear how he will fit into the Van Gaal set-up. Butt would be expected to move back to his role in charge of United’s Under 18s yet less certain is what lies in store for Scholes, who is not on a contract, and Neville, who was brought back to Old  Trafford by Moyes last summer. Of the quartet, Neville is arguably the most vulnerable. Goalkeeping coach Chris Woods could also go given Van Gaal’s preference to work with Hoek. Though Van Gaal is very much his own man when making decisions, he is also someone who pays attention to club history, which suggests he would be willing to work closely with Giggs or Butt. Danny Blind, another Van Gaal ally, will not be making the move to Manchester as he is set to continue with Holland after signing a new contract with the Dutch football federation. Own team: Current Holland assistant Patrick Kluivert could come to Old Trafford with Van Gaal . Investment: Van Gaal will be given money to spend after United failed to qualify for the Champions League . Incoming: Physio Jos Van Dijk . Keeping tabs: Video analyst Max Reckers . Controversy? Van Gaal wants goalkeeping coach Frans Hoek to join but Chris Woods has performed well . Meanwhile, United fear Wayne Rooney has suffered another injury setback after the striker limped out of training on Thursday and was sent for a scan. It is unclear if the problem is connected with the injury he suffered in the Champions League match against Bayern Munich at Old Trafford a month ago when he chipped a bone in his foot and required a painkilling injection to play. United will assess the 28-year-old’s condition today before deciding if he can face Sunderland at home on Saturday. However, with United having  little left to play for in their remaining three games, they are unlikely to risk Rooney if there is any doubt about his fitness. The England striker will also be reluctant to take any chances with the World Cup looming after going into the last two tournaments under an injury cloud. PATRICK KLUIVERT - First team coach -  Age 37Legendary Dutch striker who shot to fame as a member of Van Gaal’s European Cup-winning side with Ajax in 1995, when he scored the winning goal against AC Milan in the final at the age of 18. He teamed up again with his mentor at Barcelona in 1998. Following his retirement in 2008, Kluivert was recruited by Van Gaal to coach his strikers at AZ Alkmaar, and  then appointed as an assistant when he took charge of the Dutch national team in 2012. FRANS HOEK - Goalkeeping coach - Age 57One of Van Gaal’s longest-serving and most trusted lieutenants, the former FC Volendam goalkeeper has worked at Ajax, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and the Dutch national team, and has overseen the development of the likes of Edwin van der Sar, Pepe Reina and Victor Valdes. Hoek has written various books on the training methods of goalkeepers. JOS VAN DIJK - Physiotherapist - Age 57Another senior member of Van Gaal’s backroom team who has worked with him in Spain, Germany and Holland, and is trusted with full responsibility for the medical department. MAX RECKERS - Chief analyst - Age 34The Dutchman first worked with Van Gaal at AZ Alkmaar and then followed his boss to Bayern Munich, where he spent the next two years as his chief anaylst, a role he has subsequently carried out for the Dutch national team under Van Gaal since 2012.

Labour MPs have called for  Ed Balls to be demoted following claims that he has ‘lost his mojo’ after falsely forecasting the economy would get worse. Senior party sources say they  are alarmed by growing criticism of the Shadow Chancellor by his own backbenchers. It follows Tory taunts that  Mr Balls made a major blunder by predicting cuts would prolong the recession. He is also struggling to respond to increasing evidence that the economy is on the mend. One MP said: ‘Balls used to throw his weight around in Shadow Cabinet meetings and ignore Ed Miliband when he spoke. 'Now Balls is totally out of sorts. He doesn’t say much at Shadow Cabinet meetings and when he does, he is the one who is ignored. He has lost his mojo.’ A veteran Labour MP added: ‘For years Balls has walked around Westminster with a swagger.  Only a fool predicts what the economy is going to do because no one really knows. 'He has become a liability and must be replaced if we are to have economic credibility.’ However, replacing the Shadow Chancellor would not be easy. Possible successors such as high-flyers Chuka Umunna and Rachel Reeves are still considered too inexperienced, while respected  former Chancellor Alistair Darling is spearheading the campaign  to keep Scotland within the UK. In a further sign of Mr Balls’s diminishing power, Shadow Foreign Secretary Douglas Alexander has delivered a public rebuke to him for cosying up to  Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg. He said: ‘If Clegg wasn’t at the Cabinet table, we wouldn’t have had the bedroom tax, the rise in tuition fees or the mistakes we’ve seen in economic policy.’ Potential candidates: Possible successors such as high-flyers Chuka Umunna and Rachel Reeves are still considered too inexperienced to replace Ed Balls .","Senior party sources alarmed by growing criticism of Mr Balls .

"By . Mail On Sunday Reporter . Raising a glass: Rosdeep Kular enjoys a drink at a social occasion . Self-confessed social butterfly Rosdeep ‘Rosie’ Kular has enjoyed the company of a mixed band of friends since her marriage broke down in 2009. She recently launched a mobile beauty business and has attempted to juggle a career with looking after five children, all under the age of 10. But the 33-year-old also has a love of partying, which has taken her into a world far removed from her respectable upbringing as the daughter of a local doctor. Photographs on her Facebook page show the woman nicknamed the ‘dancing queen’ posing with a number of friends, including Mohammed Abdi, 25, who died in a shooting in Edinburgh last year. The day after his murder, Ms Kular posted a picture of herself with Mr Abdi, who was often seen at her flat in the Drylaw area of Edinburgh. According to neighbours, he sometimes took her children to school. Taken in a pub or club, he is seen in the photograph with his arms protectively around her, while she looks happy and relaxed. Mr Abdi, whose father was an Imam at the Edinburgh Central Mosque, died on May 26 last year. Six men deny his killing and are set to stand trial in April. It is clear Ms Kular enjoyed playing up to her party-loving image, claiming in one online profile: ‘Just me, myself and I….oh yeah, with a brood of five monsters, six if you count the man indoors!’ She also jokes: ‘Work full time which is a bit crapiola but it’s got to be done eh!’ Yesterday, the parents of her estranged husband, Omotoso Adekoya, who is originally from Nigeria, revealed they had reservations about her party lifestyle. They claim Mr Adekoya objected and it led to a separation – although they remain married. In Nigeria, Ms Kular’s mother-in-law, Yetunde, said that Rosie now has an as-yet unnamed partner. Yetunde admitted she had concerns about the marriage, which took place in Glenrothes, Fife, in July 2004. Posing: Rosdeep Kular in a glamorous mode, showing off a tattoo on her right arm . She said: ‘I witnessed the wedding but at first never agreed with it. Omotoso insisted so I had no choice.’ She added she initially liked Ms Kular as she was a ‘well-groomed lady’. But her opinion changed because ‘she liked going to clubs and getting drunk. She always wanted to go out to parties. Omotoso never allowed it – and that’s why she left.’ She said Mr Adekoya, the father of the three eldest children, came to the UK to study. It is understood he now runs a taxi firm. Mikaeel and his twin sister, Ashika, were born in Kirkcaldy in May 2010, after the couple’s separation. But they have had no contact with their Pakistani father. Relaxed: 'Rosie' pictured on a swing in a playground . Ms Kular was brought up in a detached house in an upmarket part of Edinburgh. Her father Gurbux, who was from India, died aged 43 when she was in her teens. Her mother, Harjinder Kular, 60, is a retired doctor who still lives in a large detached home, with a Jaguar and a Volvo parked in front of the property. She has remarried twice, most recently to Dr Bangarpet Krishnaswamy, 69, a GP originally from Bangalore, who also develops properties in Scotland. He is the director of East Neuk Healthcare, which owns a 40-bed nursing home in Anstruther, Fife.Yesterday friends said they were shocked that Ms Kular was being questioned – and found it hard to believe that she could harm  any of her children. One man, who asked not to be named, said: ‘When I was DJ-ing in a club she used to show up every week – but I’ve not seen her out in three or four years. ‘On Facebook a lot of people are asking why others are claiming she’s done this or that.’ The mother-of-five was said to be friends with Mohammed Abdi, who was shot and killed in Edinburgh last year .

"By . Steph Cockroft . A mother and father who spent five weeks crafting a magical treehouse for their children have been ordered by council chiefs to rip it down - because it does not have planning permission. Remco Bosma, 38, and his wife Sylvia, . 37, lovingly built the 12ft wooden playhouse after their children - Nick, seven, Anouk, five and Jack, three - begged for the secret hideaway. The couple spent £750 on fence panels and corrugated material before building the den in a weeping willow tree in the back garden of their home in Crowland, Lincolnshire. Sylvia Bosma, 37 - who is pictured with her children Nick, seven, Anouk, five and Jack, three - has been ordered to rip down the treehouse in Crowland, Lincolnshire, because it does not have planning permission . But just days after the project was finished, the couple received a letter from the council saying the treehouse needed planning permission - because it had a 'raised platform' and was more than 11ft high. South Holland District Council - which said it had received a complaint about the structure - ordered the family to either dismantle the treehouse 'in its entirety' or to apply for retrospective planning permission. Mr Bosma said: 'My kids will be devastated if the tree house has to come down. 'I will feel very bad tearing it down too. When you spend such a lot of time building something you become very attached to it. 'The kids saw a tree house earlier in the year and said to me that they would like one. So I went out and bought some fence panels and corrugated materials for the roof. The Bosmas spent five weeks and £750 creating the magical hideaway for their three children. But the council sent the family a letter just days later saying it had received a complaint about the structure . The council told the family it had to either tear down the treehouse or apply for retrospective planning permission . Council chiefs said a building in a garden would not usually need planning permission - but this one needs permission because it has a 'raised platform' and is more than 11ft high . 'I spent loads of my spare time up that tree and the children were over the moon with the results, the absolutely adore it. 'When the letter came I was surprised. I just did not realise you would need planning permission for a tree house.' The Bosmas have now submitted a retrospective application to the authority but face an anxious wait as to whether or not they have to rip down the precious treehouse. If the council rejects the planning application, it will have to be torn down. South Holland District Council said it had received a complaint about the treehouse, even though Mr and Mrs Bosma said noone had complained to them . Mr Bosma said: 'I had a chat with my wife and we decided to put in the planning application immediately. 'It has been over a month now and I still have no idea when we will find out the result. 'I just don't really want to think about how they will react to the news if we do have to bring it down - it would break their hearts.' Mr Bosma said the children were over the moon when the treehouse was completed and will be heartbroken if it has to be torn down . Mr and Mrs Bosma were also shocked that the council had received a complaint, even though noone had come to them first with concerns. The couple spent five weeks constructing the 12ft triangular structure and finally completed the project in March. A spokesman for South Holland District Council said: 'A member of the public contacted us about the tree house. 'We sent a letter to Mr Bosma to inform him the structure did require planning permission. 'He has now submitted a planning application which will now be considered.' The decision is expected to be made next week.","Remco and Sylvia Bosma built the treehouse in Crowland, Lincolnshire .

"By . Joel Christie . The watchful eye of a young woman who was doing dishes has been credited with preventing a well-planned family and high school massacre in Minnesota, authorities say. Chelsie Schellhas was standing at the sink of her home in Waseca on Tuesday night when out of the window she noticed a tall young man slip into the storage facility next door. 'He shut the door and normally we see people come here and it doesn’t take them 10 minutes to open a storage shed, so I called it in,' Schellhas told CNN. And she was right - once police arrived, they discovered the unit was being used to make an arsenal of explosive devices, which would eventually lead them to a cache of seven guns and six bombs, along with the materials to make more. Instinctual: Chelsie Schellahas was doing dishes at her kitchen sink when she saw would-be killer John LaDue, 17, acting suspiciously at the storage facility next to her home. She called police on instinct and her gut was right . Deadly plan: John LaDue was allegedly planning to kill his family before embarking on a massacre at Waseca High School that involved home-made bombs and guns . LaDue was allegedly making explosives in a storage unit at this facility in Waseca, Minn., but his plans to use the devices were thwarted when a nearby resident, Chelsie Schellahas, noticed him entering the unit on Tuesday night and called police . Some of the bombs were allegedly found at this playground as snow melted around Hartley Elementary School playground in Waseca, Minn, in March. John LaDue, 17, has been arrested for plotting to kill his family and massacre students at a Waseca school . John LaDue, 17, a local honor student, has allegedly admitted to an elaborate plan he had hatched to kill 'as many students as he could' as part of a personal commemoration of the Columbine High School massacre, which occurred on April 20, 1999. Schellhas told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune the teen was cutting through her backyard when she first noticed him. 'He walked through the puddles when there was a perfectly good road he could have walked on,' Schellhas told the paper. 'It just didn’t seem right to me because we see people come and go with their trucks, and they don’t come on foot and cut through people’s back yards.' 'It was like he was blatantly trying not to be seen,' she continued. 'That’s why I thought it was odd.' LaDue took 'some time' before opening the door, appearing to be breaking in, Schellhas explained. Able to see into the locker, she noticed shopping bags and trash that 'didn't look right'. He then closed it behind him, cops said, and Schellhas called 911. Officers responding to the storage locker around 7:30 pm immediately noticed a significant amount of bombs and bomb making materials, police said. 'I thought it was odd': Chelsie Schellahas said her gut instincts told her to call police when she saw John LaDue in the storage facility next to her house on Tuesday night . Caught: John LaDue was charged with four counts of attempted murder, six counts of explosives possessions and related property damage charges . LaDue has since been charged with four counts of attempted murder, six counts of explosives possessions and related property damage charges. He is being charged as a juvenile, said prosecutor Brenda Miller. LaDue first planned to kill his father, mother and sister, police said. After their slayings, the teen planned to set a fire, which would act as a diversion to tie up emergency responders as he carried out his main plot at the school. He'd planned to set off 'numerous bombs' during the lunch hour at Waseca Junior/Senior High School, then kill the school resource officer, police said. Then he'd unleash gunfire on students until police officers arrived, allegedly planning to let them kill him. The teen's cache in the storage locker contained only pieces of the puzzle. Police got a search warrant and at 10:30 p.m. arrived at LaDue's home, where he lived with his family. Behind that door lay bombs he had finished at the storage unit, numerous guns and ammunition, police say. LaDue had also detailed his plan in a journal. Police allegedly found an arsenal of seven guns, along with bombs and other materials, at this house where John LaDue lived with his family in Waseca . A bomb squad removed all recovered explosives and destroyed them by controlled detonation at a local airport. LaDue’s . arsenal included an SKS assault-style rifle, a .22-cailber rifle and a . Baretta handgun, according to the paper. He planned to use the .22 to . kill his family because it makes less noise than the other firearms. ‘A great catastrophe and tragedy was averted,’ Waseca Mayor Roy Srp said. 'I’m . very disturbed by the amount of items he had,’ said Waseca Police . captain Kris Markeson, later adding that ‘he intended to do a great . amount of harm ... the amount of thought and preparation he put into this, it’s very, very complete.' 'It was apparently first written in the . notebook June 24, 2013, and while the semantics of the terror plot were . tweaked over time, the original idea remained in tact - to kill his . family, the school liaison officer and as many students as possible,' the . court documents revealed. it is not known how LaDue, a minor, managed to obtain the firearms. LaDue was described as shy and an outcast, but someone who still had friends and was not bullied.","John LaDue planned to kill 'as many students as he could' in a commemoration of the Columbine massacre .

"By . Simon Cable Showbusiness Correspondent . Once it plied the waters of Europe, carrying coal from port to port.These days, Vega IV’s cargo is rather different. It includes a home cinema system, . state of the art kitchen and walk-in dressing room – not to mention a . fully stocked cocktail bar. The 130ft Dutch barge, built in 1959, has been transformed into a ‘floating penthouse’ moored on the Thames. And if you happen to have £1.65million idling in the bank, it could be yours. Luxury liner: Gone is the barge that lugged coal from port to port. Now, 64 years on, Vega IV has been re-purposed as an opulent 'floating penthouse' High living: The barge is on the market for £1.65million. It offers a luxury lifestyle but is cheaper than similar properties on land. Most London houseboats cost less than £100,000 . Shaken, not stirred: When the river is calm, owners can entertain in their state of the art cocktail bar. The barge is expected to be use as an entertainment venue rather than a home . Its . other luxurious features include under-floor heating, a 40in HD . flatscreen television, a rainfall shower and a hanging fireplace. If that wasn’t enough, the lucky . owner will have their own butler on call 24 hours a day, with room . service offered by the nearby five-star Hotel Rafayel. As you might expect, the property is being marketed towards the capital’s wealthiest businessmen and celebrities. Floating house, floating fireplace: The unique hanging fireplace in the corner of the living room is just one of the barge's novelty features. It's quirky extras, including an on-call butler, have peaked the interest of singer Bryan Adams and explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes . Small print: There is no stamp duty or mooring charges on the barge, which is moored in Battersea, South London. Owners will have to pay a £3,000 charge every year to Port of London Authority and and annual service charge of £7,500 . No expense spared: The barge has been imported from Holland, Belgium and France and takes between seven and ten months to fill out. The boat has three double bedrooms and an outdoor terrace . Singer Bryan Adams and explorer Sir . Ranulph Fiennes are among those said to have made enquiries. The vessel . is moored at Oyster Pier, a new development in Battersea, South London. Vega IV is the first boat to have been refitted so far, and there is space at the harbour for nine more vessels. Prospective buyers can have their craft tailored and designed to their own specifications. Developers say they expect the boats . to be used mostly as entertaining spaces rather than homes. Owners will . be able to use the hotel’s gym and beauty salon and will even be granted . the use of a neighbouring heli-pad. The first boat has three double bedrooms and 2,300sq ft of internal space, with its own outdoor terrace. It also comes with a working engine, . which can reach a top speed of 10mph. The barges themselves, which are . being sold through London estate agent Bective Leslie Marsh, are . imported from Holland, Belgium and France, and take between seven and . ten months to fit out. There is no stamp duty or mooring . charges, although owners will have to pay a £3,000 Port of London . Authority charge each year, plus an annual service charge of £7,500. Chris Atherton, manager at Oyster . Pier, said: ‘The challenge was to design houseboats to appeal to the . prime central London market. ‘The boats are the floating . equivalent of luxury penthouses, but they cost a fraction of the price . of what a similar type of property on land would cost. Room with a view: The owner can watch the world go by from their spot on the Thames. Prospective buyers can have their craft designed and tailored to their liking . Prototype: The 2,300sq ft barge comes with an on-call butler, with room service offered by the nearby five-star Hotel Rafayel. This is the first of nine models moored in Oyster Pier . There is almost no limit to what people can create. Whatever they want in their boat, we can try and make it happen. ‘There has been a lot of interest, . not just from people who wan  to use them as homes to live in, but . from people who simply use them as spaces to entertain their guests.’ Most houseboats and barges in London cost less than £100,000.","130ft Dutch barge is moored in Battersea, South London can be used as an entertainment venue .

"By . Daniel Mills . An Australian rugby league player has become the first player banned for inappropriate use of social media after a gay slur was posted on his Twitter account. Grayson Goodwin, 24, was given a 26-week ban for the tweet 'Gay refs shouldn’t be allowed to ref because they r so s***' which appeared during an NRL game on March 21. It appeared for only a few minutes, but was retweeted 30 times by followers, and followers of followers. Banned: Grayson Goodwin pictured right with suspended NRL player Blake Ferguson. Goodwin has received a 26-week ban for a gay slur directed at homosexual referee Matt Checcin . The ban has effectively ended any hope of the 24-year-old playing in the NRL ever again. He admitted to it having ended his career. 'My career has been ruined and I can’t play at all,' the 24-year-old said. More... Don't worry, the PLANE has a parachute!

Rachael Finch joins celebrity mums spending their special day walking for charity in Sydney . Goodwin, who plays for lower-tier club the Cabramatta Two Blues, told the NSWRL a friend tweeted the message when he went to the toilet and he removed it when he returned. It was posted during a game officiated by openly gay referee Matt Checcin and one in which his brother was involved in. But NSWRL Officials did not accept the testimony of the unnamed friend, who appeared at a hearing telling them he was the one who posted the tweet. Goodwin was later informed, via a letter, that he would not be eligible to return to the game until September 20. He told NSWRL officials the tweet was only live for eight minutes before deleting it. 'I opened my account and saw the Tweet and deleted it straight away,' Goodwin told the Daily Telegraph. Unprecedented: A friend of Goodwin admitted to posting the tweet but NSWRL officials still decided to suspend the player . 'I told my mate off and I forgot all about it. The post was only up for eight minutes.' The friend was a the hearing with Goodwin and took responsibility for the tweet. “He stood up and told them what had happened,” Goodwin said. In a bizarre twist, the Daily Telegraph reported that it was directed at openly homosexual referee Matt Checcin who used to baby sit Goodwin as a child. He said it was 'ironic' that he had been given a career ending ban for a tweet about a man he has the utmost respect for. Meanwhile Goodwin's ban is yet another sour note for the sport of rugby league after allegations of racism during a recent Under 20's State of Origin fixture.

"By . Ian Ladyman . Follow @@Ian_Ladyman_DM . Two days before what would appear to be his inevitable coronation as a Barclays Premier League winner, Manuel Pellegrini sat behind a desk in a Portakabin at Manchester City’s training ground and stuck rigidly to a favoured formula. ‘It is a normal game,’ Pellegrini said on Friday. ‘Just one more game. After the finish on Sunday I will tell you what I feel.’ Friday afternoons with Pellegrini never tend to be very exciting. Rarely, if ever, does he tell anyone what he really feels. Even his players claim not to know much more than they absolutely need to. Control: Manuel Pellegrini looked relaxed during training with City on the verge of the title . Preparation: Manchester City face West Ham at the Etihad in their final game of the season . Champions elect: City need just a point against West Ham to win their second title in three years . THE TITLE . If West Ham win at the Etihad, Liverpool can pip Man City by beating Newcastle at Anfield. EUROPA LEAGUE . Hull qualify through the FA Cup and fifth-placed Everton are in. Tottenham will get the final spotwith a point against Aston Villa. If Spurs lose, Man Utd can pip them with a win at Southampton. IS THERE A BONUS PLACE FROM FAIR PLAY LEAGUE? No. Only the top three nations in UEFA’s Respect rankings get an extra Europa League spot. Norway, Sweden and Finland will receive that honour. PREMIER RELEGATION . Norwich still have a mathematical chance ofsurvival but need to beat Arsenal and hope West Brom lose to Stoke with a 17-goal swing in the Canaries’ favour. ‘It’s hard to really get to know him,’ said a source close to one of City’s English players this week. ‘He’s . just a nice bloke. His training is straightforward, nothing  amazing. But he just gets the job done and lets the players do theirs. ‘What . is important to them is that he is straight. He is approachable and if . you ask him a question, you get an answer. Too many managers bulls**** . players or, even worse, ignore them. You don’t get that with Pellegrini. You get an answer and — even if it’s not the answer you want — the . players appreciate that.’ If . Friday press conferences and weekday training sessions are nothing to . get excited about under Pellegrini, Saturdays and Sundays tend to be . different. One more point at home to West Ham United tomorrow will bring City their second title in three seasons. The . London club know all about City’s power. Already this season, City’s . threshing machine has brought them 12 goals in three games against Sam . Allardyce’s team. Pellegrini’s football has been expressive, aggressive . and relentless. It is the way City football director Txiki Begiristain . de- manded it to be when Pellegrini was hired last summer. ‘That was . absolutely a prerequisite,’ said a club source. The football flies in the face of Pellegrini’s character and demeanour, though. Hungry: Liverpool will be ready to pounce should City slip up on the final day of the season . Party time: A 4-0 win over Aston Villa on Wednesday put Manchester City on the brink of the title . Changes: Pellegrini has steadied the ship at the Etihad after a poor last season under Roberto Mancini . City should be pleased to see Martin Atkinson in charge. In his first Premier League game City won 3-0 at home, he was in charge when they won the 2011 FA Cup final and when they won the League Cup in March. But he allowed Michael Owen to score the 96th-minute winner in the Manchester derby — a 4-3 thriller in 2009. He . claimed he was ‘a dog’ as a player and had to completely and . deliberately change his character in order to bring about the calm that . now personifies him. Whatever . the case, when he arrived at City last July, Pellegrini soon realised . he was inheriting a dressing room badly in need of soothing. ‘Manuel . wasn’t hired because of his calm or because he is a nice man,’ another . club source told Sportsmail this week. ‘He was hired for his reputation . as a coach. ‘Having said that, he had done his research before he arrived. He knew what had happened last season.’ It’s hard to assess Pellegrini’s impact on City without mentioning his predecessor Roberto Mancini. It is necessary context. The . Italian was a successful City coach and popular in some quarters. None . the less, the dressing room he left behind was fractured and one of . Pellegrini’s clearest triumphs has been to apply some glue. The end: Mancini was popular among fans after guiding City to the title in 2012 but left last season . ‘Even . the best players could feel like s*** under Mancini,’ said a dressing . room source. ‘For example, David Silva signed a new contract at the . start of last season and reached the end talking about leaving. That was . how bad it got. Even Yaya Toure got fed up. ‘Pellegrini . put a stop to that. He doesn’t scapegoat players. Dressing room . b******ings aren’t really his style. We never really get them now. We . just go out and play.’ If all this sounds too simple, that is because it . is. However, . Pellegrini’s ability to drag something approaching the best from the . playing squad built in part by Mancini has been fundamental to progress . and Silva  hinted at that in an interview he gave in the run-up to Sunday’s game. ‘Having . Manuel here has helped me personally,’ said the Spanish international. ‘It’s been really good for me. He’s made it a happy place and has . changed our style of play, too. You see that in the way we play, attack . minded, lots of goals. Silverware: Pellegrini lifts the Capital One Cup after City beat Sunderland in the final at Wembley . Rejuvenated: David Silva is happy with Pellegrini's appointment after become disillusioned under Mancini . ‘His . calmness has been obvious and it really helps us at difficult moments. It’s nice to have that calm attitude around you when things get tough.’ If good coaches can be identified by an ability to improve players then there is evidence in Pellegrini’s favour. Players . like Edin Dzeko, Aleksandar Kolarov and Samir Nasri have taken steps . forward this season and even those written off by some supporters — such . as Javi  Garcia and Martin Demichelis — are ending the season well. That is down to subtle  handling, at least in part. Players . left out of the team, meanwhile, have benefited from some honesty. One . of Pellegrini’s biggest calls was to drop Joe Hart for a month in early . winter. In World Cup season it could have demoralised the England . goalkeeper. ‘Joe . came back from that a better goalkeeper,’ revealed a source close to . him. ‘He was disappointed and hurt but Pellegrini explained the reasons . honestly and clearly. Joe had little choice to accept it and deal with . because it was all up front.’ On . arriving at the club, Pellegrini soon established a reputation as a . measured coach who talked but also listened. Living in the nearby . football enclave of Hale, the 60-year-old plays the occasional round of . golf and has now brought his wife Carmen to join him, something he had . never done in a decade working outside South America. Decisions: Joe Hart was dropped for a month after a number of mistakes, but has turned his form around . Shake it off: Alan Pardew confronts Pellegrini during a game against Newcastle in January . There . have been some hiccups this season. Defeat by Barcelona in the . Champions League at the Etihad Stadium prompted a rather embarrassing . attack on the Swedish match official. ‘Within half an hour of that he knew what he’d said was wrong,’ said the club source. Briefly . an old adversary, Jose Mourinho, threatened to interrupt progress as . Chelsea dismantled City on their own turf and, just for a few days, . Pellegrini allowed himself to be pulled towards a public argument with . the Portuguese. Pellegrini . soon reverted to type, though, and the incident that perhaps best . summed up his approach in the rather frenetic, emotional world of the . Premier League came at St James’ Park in January when Newcastle manager . Alan Pardew called him a ‘f****** old c***’ on the touchline. Pardew subsequently wrote to Pellegrini to apologise, something the City manager never publicised. It . was Pellegrini’s reaction after the game that said most about him, . though, when it was explained to him in Spanish exactly what Pardew had . called him. ‘Is that all?’ Pellegrini smiled, with a raised eyebrow. ‘I have been called much worse.’ West Ham will have the fate of the Premier League title in their hands, but can they pull off a shock at the Etihad? WHY THEY CAN... West . Ham have a habit of doing well on the last day of the season. In 2006 . they denied their sickness-stricken rivals Tottenham a place in the . Champions League with a 2-1 home win and in 2007 Carlos Tevez’s goal at . Old Trafford ensured the club escaped relegation on the final day. City should beware a Sunday roast. They have lost six league games this season, and four of those came on a Sunday. WHY THEY CAN'T... West . Ham do not travel well to the blue half of Manchester. In their last 25 . away games at Man City, they have won just twice, drawing three times . and losing a whopping 20 games. 1 - Man City have lost just one of their last 13 Premier League matches against West Ham. They have won nine and drawn three. City . don’t so much have home advantage as home domination. They have won 49 . points at home this season, more than any side, and they have a . phenomenal goalscoring record at the Etihad. 12-1 . - After three games this season, one in the league and two in the . League Cup semifinal, Man City are beating West Ham by an aggregate . score of 12-1. Don’t bet against them extending that score-line on .

"By . Jack Doyle . Lord Justice Leveson's report into hone hacking did not mention blue-chip companies . Police are refusing to publish  the names of law firms, blue-chip companies and celebrities accused of hiring private investigators to break the law – to protect their ‘human rights’. The Serious Organised Crime Agency has a list of those accused of paying private eyes to dig for information, including using illegal means such as phone hacking. But yesterday it emerged that the agency, dubbed Britain’s FBI, is suppressing the names, claiming that to publish them might breach the Human Rights Act. It cited Article 8, the right to a private and family life. The agency also claimed that publishing the list could damage the firms’ commercial interests by tainting them with guilt. Last night one Tory MP called for the heads of Soca to be sacked if they continue to block the release of the list. And senior MPs who are investigating the scandal criticised the agency for its lack of transparency. Labour’s Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, wrote to Soca to ask for ‘all the information Soca holds on private investigators and their links with the police and private sector’. He said: ‘Soca has indicated that it is prepared to give the client list to us in confidence. This has still not been received. It is a disappointment that this is yet another document the committee has had to receive in secret from Soca.’ He added: ‘In view of the public interest, openness and transparency may be the only way that the public can be reassured that no one is above the law and [that] Soca have done all they can to address this issue.’ Mr Vaz said he will write to the leading 100 legal firms and every firm in the FTSE 100 to ask them if they have ever commissioned private investigators and for what. Labour's Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs . Select Committee, wrote to Soca to ask for 'all the information Soca . holds on private investigators and their links with the police and . private sector' On June 24 he wrote to Sir Ian Andrews, the chairman of Soca, to ask him to ‘provide the committee with a list of clients who hired private investigators to break the law that Soca is aware of’, setting a deadline of June 28. In a letter dated July 12, published on the committee’s website on Wednesday, Sir Ian – a former Ministry of Defence mandarin – said publishing the information could ‘substantially undermine the financial viability of major organisations by tainting them with public association with criminality’. The evidence has now been ‘formally classified’, he added. Detailing his reasons, he said there was a ‘lack of certainty’ over whether the investigators’ clients had ‘guilty knowledge’ and were aware of what was going on. And he said naming them could undermine their right to a private  and family life under the Human Rights Act. He also cited the ‘possible prejudice which any publication might have on ongoing criminal investigations and future regulatory action’. He wrote: ‘This reflects the fact . that the information it contains, if published, might prejudice . individual security or liberty, impede the investigation (or facilitate . the commission) of serious crime or substantially undermine the . financial viability of major organisations by tainting them with public . association with criminality.’ The list of clients stems from a . Metropolitan Police investigation codenamed Operation Millipede which . led to the jailing of four  private detectives in January last year. How the Daily Mail has reported the issue since June (above and below) The court heard personal information was ‘blagged’ by private investigators who impersonated targets while phoning banks, building societies and telephone companies. But no details of the men’s alleged clients came out in court. Last month it emerged that a Soca report into private investigators that was submitted to the Leveson Inquiry – but not mentioned in Lord Justice Leveson’s report or published on the inquiry website – alleged widespread misbehaviour by businesses other than the media. The confidential document, codenamed Project Riverside, contained intelligence material on the wider use of private investigators outside the media.

Rob Wilson said in a letter to Home Secretary Theresa May that it is entirely unacceptable for Soca to put its own reputation and commercial interests before its duties to the public . One hacker reportedly said that 80 per cent of his client list was blue-chip companies and high-profile individuals, with the rest relating to the media. Questions have been asked on why little apparent action has been taken either to disrupt this trade in information or to target those paying for it. They are reported to include a corporate giant, a celebrity broadcaster, a media personality and a wealthy businessman.

Backbench Tory MP Rob Wilson called for both Sir Ian and Mr Pearce to be sacked if they continue to block the release of the list of names. The MP for Reading East said in a letter to Home Secretary Theresa May last night: ‘It is entirely unacceptable for Soca to put its own reputation and commercial interests before its duties to the public in tackling serious criminality. ‘Many people will rightly see Soca’s actions as an abuse of the Official Secrets Act and the Human Rights Act. It appears that Soca is in danger of losing its way in taking the decisions it has. ‘Tackling serious and organised crime is an incredibly important function in a civilised country. It will be difficult for the public to have confidence in Soca while it appears there is one law for the rich and powerful, and another for the rest.’ Scotland Yard’s continuing investigations into newspapers are expected to cost nearly £40million by the time they conclude in  April 2015.","Police refused to publish names of companies accused of hiring private eyes .

Murdering the CEO of America's largest investment firm wouldn't be enough to quench the 'blood lust' of big bank's fiercest opponents, Bill Clinton allegedly told Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner. Geithner recalled the conversation in an interview with The New York Times Magazine earlier this week. ' ""You could take Lloyd Blankfein into a dark alley and . slit his throat, and it would satisfy them for about two days. Then the . blood lust would rise again,"" ' Geithner says Clinton told him.

They are pictured here at The Clinton Global Initiative America meeting in June 30, 2011 . During the 2008 financial crisis the U.S. government gave out billions of dollars in loans to banks deemed 'too big to fail' including Goldman Sachs through the Troubled Assets Relief Program, TARP. Goldman Sachs came under scrutiny from Congress and several federal agencies afterward for predatory lending practices that contributed to the financial and housing crises. Geithner, who worked in various positions at Treasury during the Clinton administration, served as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York during the first half of the financial crisis. He is one of three government officials, along with Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernake and former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, who is also a former Goldman Sachs CEO, credited with formulating TARP. Congress passed TARP in the final months of President George W. Bush's presidency. Geithner assumed responsibility for implementing the unpopular program when the became Treasury Secretary in January 2009 at the start of Barack Obama's presidency. 'People think we gave the banks this free gift of hundreds and hundreds . of billions of dollars, using the taxpayers’ money that we would never . see again,' Geithner explained to a group of Harvard students recently. 'We are going to earn, all in, a couple hundred billion dollars.' 'Much of the dominant view about the strategy is the inverse of the truth.' Goldman Sachs and the other too big to fail banks have since repaid their government loans and are once again turning a profit. Geithner left his post in 2013 after serving as Treasury Secretary throughout Obama's entire first term. He now works at a private equity firm.

"By . Rebecca English . Updated: . 04:22 EST, 7 July 2011 . The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge made an unscheduled visit today to a town almost entirely reduced to ashes by forest fires less than two months ago. Some 40 per cent of Slave Lake in Northern Alberta was razed when ground when it was hit by a wildfire on May 15. Fortunately there were no deaths in the town, named after the First Nations People there known as the Slavey. Witnessing the devastation: William and Kate are shown around Slave Lake by a group including the town's mayor after making an unscheduled stop at the town which was devastated by fire . Gutted: The Royal couple examine the remains of a burnt out car destroyed during May's fire . Destroyed: Prince William looks at the twisted remains of a car that was caught in the fire . Wreckage: William and Kate examine a piece  of damaged metal from the fire with Ed Stelmech (left) and City Reeve Denny Garratt . But the damage was extensive and forced the complete evacuation of Slave Lake's 7,000 residents - the largest such displacement in the province's history. The inferno began as a forest fire 15 kilometers outside town.  Firefighters battled to keep in under control and had thought they were winning the fight when the wind turned violent and gusts of up to 100 km per hour whipsawed glowing embers overhead and on to homes and businesses which quickly ignited. Most of the destruction happened in . the south-eastern section of town - where half the homes were consumed . by flames -  as well as the mall, town hall and many downtown . businesses. Face to face: Kate talks to local residents and Canadian fans at Slave Lake where 372 homes and 300 apartments were destroyed by fire this May . Edgy: Kate was wearing the same navy designer . blazer she wore to depart the UK, her favoured pair of skin tight jeans . and Pied A Terre black wedges with a cream ruffled chiffon shirt . Colourful display: Most of Slave Lake's residents turned out to catch a glimpse of Kate and William . Almost all . 7,000 residents were evacuated from the town, with hundreds going to . evacuation shelters in nearby towns including Edmonton. The Duke and Duchess flew into the town on Wednesday on a government Challenger jet. The couple stepped off their jet and were greeted by a small line of dignitaries. Picture perfect: Fans used their cameras to capture their memories of the day, while Kate appeared to take something from one member of the crowd . Fans of all ages: The Duchess talks with an elderly lady in her wheelchair, while William's younger supporters gave him this pink cuddly toy . Royal wave: Prince William salutes the crowd that had gathered to see him and his wife in the town . Kate was wearing the same navy designer blazer she wore to depart the UK, her favoured pair of skin tight jeans and Pied A Terre black wedges with a cream ruffled chiffon shirt. William was smart but casual in jeans and a blazer. The couple immediately headed off in a mini bus to see the devastation first hand and meet with displaced residents. The request to tour the devastated . town came directly from the royal couple, said Kevin MacLeod, Canadian . secretary to the Queen. Steady on:  A flight attendant offers Kate, wearing A Nude Burberry shirt and J Brand jeans, a hand as her and William board a Seaplane bound for Blachford Lake at the Old Town Float Base on Tuesday . All aboard: Once arrived at the lake William and Kate went for a paddle with Fort Smith's village elder Francois Paulette . But it was kept under wraps until the last minute to ensure their presence wouldn't disrupt any relief efforts in the region. ‘It . wasn't a last-minute decision,’ he said. ‘Their overwhelming concern . was that they did not want a public announcement early on for fear that . it would somehow detract from those people who are now putting in place . all the reconstruction efforts.’ William . has made a point to visit disaster torn regions in the Commonwealth, . notably Christchurch, New Zealand, hit by an earthquake in February. Chat: The Duke and Duchess meet with a group of residents whose homes were destroyed in the fire . The sign says it all: Two residents of Slave Lake welcome Prince William and his wife to their town . We love you: Most of the town turned out to see the couple, with fans also making placards to welcome them . Special guest: Even a resident's corgi turned up to meet William and Kate . The Duke and Duchess spent an hour and a half touring areas of the town which were affected by the fire and visited Northern Lakes College, where they met with emergency services personnel from the fire brigade, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the medical response team. Their Royal Highnesses also had a private meeting with families affected by the disaster, still reeling from their loss of their homes and livelihoods. Most of Slave Lake's residents turned out to catch a glimpse of Kate and William. Families stood in the baking sunshine outside the town's Northern Lakes College waving flowers, posters and balloons. Banners read ‘We love you for coming’ and ‘Welcome Will and Kate’. Arrival: The Royal couple leave their jet after touching down at Slave Lake airport ahead of their visit to the town . Meet and greet: The Duke and Duchess are welcomed by dignitaries after their arrival in Slave Lake . Unscheduled stop: Prince William and Kate pose at Yellowknife airport before their flight to Slave Lake . Recycling her clothes: Kate wore the same navy . designer blazer she chose to depart the UK, her favoured pair of skin . tight jeans and Pied A Terre black wedges with a cream ruffled chiffon . shirt. At the front of the crowd was Maria Sharpe, 28, who lost most of her possessions when the devastating fire struck. One of the only mementos she has left of her home is a photograph taken on Royal Wedding day when she and her friends had a party to celebrate Kate and William tying the knot. She brought the picture to show the royal couple. Maria said: ‘This picture is special to me because it is a reminder of my home. ‘It was an awful thing to happen. ‘But in some ways it turned the community into a family. Preparing to depart: A Canadian Air Force member salutes the Duke as he and wife board their Challenger jet for the flight to Slave Lake . Caring: The Duchess chatted with six-year-old Riley Oldford who also  presented her with a bouquet of flowers before her departure . Please to meet you: Prince William speaks to Riley and tries to shake his hand . ‘And being gathered here with everyone today to meet Kate and William to welcome them here brings us even closer. ‘We heard a few rumours they might be coming but to actually have them here is incredible.’ Denise Camarneiro, 40, her husband Mario, 50, and their two children Nikita, 10, and Tyler, 12, had their home completely destroyed in the fire. Denise said: ‘Ours was the third home to burn down. ‘We were told by authorities we had ten minutes to evacuate and we left with just the clothes on our backs and our three dogs and our guinea pig. Suits you, Sir: Canadian soldiers load clothes belonging to Prince William onto their jet . Same rules for everyone: A sniffer dog exams the luggage before it is loaded onto the jet used by the Royal couple . ‘At the time it feels like the worst thing that can ever happen to you. ‘Soon we will have been homeless for two months. ‘Having Kate and William take time out of their schedule to come here is such a boost for this community. ‘They seem very compassionate. ‘Kate reminds me a lot of Diana.’","Couple visit Slave Lake, where 40 per cent of the town was destroyed by fire in May .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . A Michigan school district has withdrawn its efforts to fire a teacher over a video showing an autistic student stuck in a classroom chair and instead is suspending her for a year. Nicole McVey reached for her cell phone . when the 11-year-old boy, who has Asperger's syndrome, became caught . through a chair at Oaktree Elementary School in Goodrich, Michigan. The video was recorded in November and released to a TV station in February. In it, the boy is shown with his head and arms stuck in an opening in the back of the chair. Scroll down for video . Distressed: A video recorded by a teacher shows a student with Asperger's syndrome mocking a boy, 11, who had become stuck in a chair while the head teacher chimes in. They then sent the video to other staff . McVey and Principal Michael Ellis . then taunted the fifth-grader, according to . Patrick Greenfelder, a lawyer for the boy's family. Ellis has since resigned, but McVey had been fighting the district's efforts to fire her. The Goodrich Area Schools board was to meet in closed session yesterday evening to consider the settlement with McVey. According . to Greenfelder, McVey can be heard questioning the boy in the video . about how he got stuck before asking: 'Do you want to get Tasered?' The . boy is told that a maintenance crew is on the way to help and . Greenfelder has said Ellis is heard saying it's really 'not an emergency . in their book'. Hearing: The school board had voted to seek to fire McVey in February but she now just be suspended for a year without pay . McVey . apologised to the boy's parents in a letter obtained by The Associated . Press news agency, which is not identifying the boy or his parents. McVey wrote that 'there are no excuses or reasons or explanations for what happened'. 'I . made a significant mistake,' her letter goes on to say. 'You need to . know that throughout this time my heart and my gut have told me that I . was wrong.' McVey has spent 14 years in the district, which is about 40 miles northwest of Detroit. 'While . words will never be able to take away what happened, they provide the . only means that I have to request your forgiveness for betraying your . trusts in me, and to let you know that I am truly sorry,' her letter . says. 'I hope that you know I am not a bad person, but one who made a very bad series of choices on that day.' Support: Many parents at the board meeting in February said they thought McVey was a great teacher . Greenfelder said in February that the boy suffered broken blood vessels in his eyes while trying to escape from the chair. The . video came to light after a staff member responsible for reporting . bullying got ahold of it and informed administrators, said Greenfelder. After administrators saw the video, the Goodrich School Board voted to accept Ellis's resignation and seek to fire McVey by filing tenure charges. But the decision has upset some in the Goodrich school community, and numerous parents attended a board meeting with signs in support of McVey. 'I know she is supported by the community, the other teachers, the staff, I have learned a lot from her and I support her fully,' said Leanne Ruediger, a substitute teacher whose children attend the school. 'I believe that Nicole's intentions and motivations are always in the right place.' Scene: McVey has been suspended from Oaktree Elementary School in Goodrich, Michigan since February and will be now undergo a period of retraining before being allowed back into the classroom sometime in 2015 . Another parent added: 'There's no way that Mrs McVey ever bullied any child in that class.' They added that the word 'Taser' does not refer to a stun gun in the classroom context, but when you take two fingers and use them in a tickling motion on someone's side. The parents of the boy said they were upset by the support she had received and said they did not like the use of the word Taser. 'Our son did nothing wrong, but yet this seems to be another case of blaming the victim,' they added. They are considering a lawsuit. McVey is on paid administrative leave while private tenure hearings debating her future at the school take place.","Nicole McVey filmed boy on cell phone when he got stuck in classroom .

"By . Ryan Gorman . MLB Network analyst Mitch Williams was tossed from a youth baseball game for profanely berating an umpire in front of horrified children and parents, witnesses said. The former Major League Baseball pitcher known as ‘Wild Thing’ during his time with the Philadelphia Phillies reportedly called the umpire a ‘motherf****r’ during his furious ranting in front of children only 10-years-old. Multiple witnesses told Deadspin Williams was coaching his son’s Cal Ripken youth team Saturday during a tournament in Maryland when things went south. Tossed: Former Phillies pitcher Mitch Williams (pictured throwing out the ceremonial first pitch before a 2008 playoff game) was ejected from a youth baseball game for swearing at an umpire . Wild Thing was said to have been griping about balls and strikes the whole game – from his perch behind first base. His complaints led to several arguments on the field that eventually culminated in his profanity-laced blowout after he ‘shouted something to a parent in the stands about getting that umpire fired,’ sources told the site. Another parent in attendance said the confrontation was ‘a train wreck,’ and that Williams had to be physically separated from the unnamed umpire. ‘He went nuts. He got into the umpire’s face like it was the Major Leagues.’ He then refused to leave the field and caused a 10 minute delay that led to him being banned from the entirety of the tournament, said the site. Williams eventually left the field but remained behind home plate to watch the rest of the game, said another witness. There were no further incidents. He lives in infamy: Williams famously gave up the World Series-winning bottom of the ninth inning Game 7 home run to outfielder Joe Carter #29 of the Toronto Blue Jays in 1993 . The Phillies ace then took to Twitter to defend his actions after being taunted by a fan. ‘To set the record straight. I was thrown out for laughing at a call. Then the [umpire] threatened to fight me. Said pick a time and place,’ Williams tweeted. ‘For those that think I'm making this up. It is on film... and when he threatened me [one] of my coaches came out and put his hands on him,’ continued Williams. Williams also swore that archived video would vindicate him, but that footage was nowhere to be found – it is curiously the only game in the entire tournament not able to be viewed online. ‘It started in the 1st [inning], the ump yelled at the opposing coach, then yelled at me. I asked why r u [sic] yelling at me I haven't even met u [sic] yet,’ he continued. Cal Ripken baseball has not yet publicly commented on the incident, and league officials were not immediately able to be reached by MailOnline. The MLB Network has also remained silent about the incident. Williams’ ban was lifted, but his son’s team did not win the tournament.","Mitch Williams reportedly argued balls and strikes with the umpires the whole game before the epic blowout .

"By . Dan Bloom . The jailed doctor who helped the CIA track down Osama bin Laden has been dealt another blow after death threats forced his lawyer to quit. Campaigners for Dr Shakil Afridi claim Pakistan has pursued him on politicised charges ever since he took DNA from the terrorist leader, allowing the U.S. to shoot him dead. Now Dr Afridi's lawyer has quit the case after receiving a 'final warning' from Islamic militants. Vital: The U.S. has hailed Dr Shakil Afridi (pictured) as a hero for collecting Osama bin Laden's DNA from his remote hideout. But the doctor has been in Pakistani jails since he was stopped at the border days later . Campaign: Friends and supporters of Dr Afridi say he has been pursued by the Pakistani government because officials were embarrassed and angered by the killing of bin Laden. Left: his brother Jamil Afridi . 'They have warned me to either . quit the case or be ready to face the dire consequences,' said the lawyer, Samiullah Khan Afridi. 'My family and I are under severe threat.' The . U.S. has put intense pressure on Pakistan to free Dr Afridi, who is not . related to his lawyer, despite the fact he has denied helping the CIA. But the lawyer said this pressure had only made his situation worse. Pakistan . and the U.S. were locked in a diplomatic rift over the killing of bin . Laden, because officials were angry at the Americans for carrying . out the mission themselves on foreign soil. Some . U.S. figures, meanwhile, questioned how bin Laden had managed to hide . for so long in plain sight and raised the possibility that he was . sheltered by elements in the Pakistani forces. Hiding in plain sight: The terrorist leader lived in this fortified compound, sending messages via couriers . Peaceful: A shepherd with goats near the hideout of the Al Qaeda leader, which was stormed in May 2011 . The . U.S. has hailed Dr Afridi as a hero, saying the doctor ran a fake . vaccination programme which allowed forces to identify the Al Qaeda . chief. He was stopped at a . border crossing days after U.S. Navy SEALS stormed bin Laden's Pakistan . compound and shot him dead in May 2011. Pakistan . arrested him and jailed him for 33 years for treason - over charges . which the authorities insisted were unrelated to the bin Laden case. Terrorist: Osama bin Laden was shot dead . He was convicted of providing money and medical treatment to Islamic militants in Khyber . tribal region. But the claims were denied by both his family and militants, and a retrial was ordered. In March this year a court in Pakistan . reduced his sentence to 23 years on appeal. While . the appeal was ongoing, however, Dr Afridi faced what campaigners said . was further persecution - when he was charged with the murder of one of . his own patients in hospital.. It centred on the death of Suleman Afridi (no relation) in 2005 and was allegedly brought by the man's mother. 'She . stated that he operated on her son at a hospital in Khyber Agency even . though he was not a surgeon, and that caused (her son's) death,' one . official said. The lawyer's departure came after a suicide bombing killed five people yesterday in the north western city of Peshawar. The . blast targeted refugees who were standing in line on a football pitch . waiting to register with the government, a police official said, and . injured another 12 people. In . the Bajur tribal region on the Afghan border, meanwhile, two roadside . bomb blasts killed a Pakistani soldier and wounded four yesterday. No . one immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks, which are the . latest in a string of bombings which have killed thousands of people. Suicide bombing: A blast killed five people and injured 12, including the child pictured, as refugees from rebel fighting lined up on a football pitch in Peshawar yesterday to register their details with the government .

Pakistan's Taliban have killed thousands in their fight to overthrow the government and install a harsh brand of Shariah law. Nawaz Sharif, the Pakistani prime minister, has made . negotiations with the militants a centerpiece of his government policy . since he took office last summer, but no deal has been struck.

"By . Lydia Warren . A woman who pretended to be an heiress to a $100 million fortune and allegedly scammed businesses out of thousands of dollars is finally facing sentencing after years of lies. Nydia Neubauer, 66, could get decades behind bars when she is sentenced in Bucks County Court, Pennsylvania on Tuesday for swindling companies out of more than $100,000 in jewelry, real estate, clothes and car rentals. She pleaded guilty in December to charges including identity theft, bad checks and forgery - a decade after she first hit headlines for similar scams in New York City, such as ordering expensive furs or pledging eye-watering sums to charities that she then failed to pay. Locked up: Nydia Neubauer, 66, will be sentenced on Tuesday for allegedly pretending to be an heiress (right in her passport photo) as she scammed local businesses out of hundreds of thousands of dollars . Under a series of aliases, she allegedly tricked socialite and philanthropist Denise Rich and the nephew of fashion . Tommy Hilfiger and was still under investigation when she was arrested in 2010. After leaving New York City, she had moved to Bucks County, where residents did not know of her past scandals, and convinced them that she was a millionaire widow. Among her victims was Linda Jagiela, who owned a car service in Marlton and provided Neubauer a driver for any route she needed. Jagiela told the Philadelphia Inquirer that she found Neubauer eccentric - like many of the wealthy clients she catered to - but that she had no reason to doubt her. She said that Neubauer traveled with a maid and two dogs, and often spoke about her numerous homes and celebrity friends. But Jagiela soon learned she would never be paid for her service; Neubauer used a credit . card from a British bank with a deferred payment date and checks bounced. She eventually lost $3,500. Charged: Neubauer, pictured after her arrest in September 2010, has remained in jail because she was unable to post bail. She faces decades behind bars when she is sentenced - but will likely get less . Neubauer was arrested in September 2010 in Belmar, New Jersey when she failed to pay for dinner. She was transferred to Bucks County, where she has been since last year after failing to post bail. Jagiela said she will be at the sentencing to make sure she goes to jail. Victim: Linda Jagiela's car service was allegedly scammed out of $3,500 by Neubauer . 'I'll probably keep an eye on her for the rest of my life,' Jagiela said. If not, 'she will do this again and again and again'. Bucks County Assistant District Attorney Jay Karsch told the Inquirer that Neubauer had not appeared like a typical criminal. 'Here's somebody who apparently [claims to have] a lot of money, whose husband died and left her $100 million or so,' Karsch said. 'So, she wants to buy jewelry? Sure, I'll sell her jewelry.' Last year, she pleaded guilty to 10 . counts of access device fraud, 10 counts of theft of services, three . counts of forgery, two counts of theft by deception, one count of . identity theft and one count of knowingly issuing bad checks. At the time, she told the judge, her family had raised about $85,000 of the $190,000 she owed. She could face dozens of years in prison when she is sentenced, the prosecutor said, but she is likely to get less. In the New York cases, she had allegedly written a series of bad checks and asked to borrow credit cards before disappearing, Page Six reported. She was eventually thrown out of a hotel after trying to pay with a credit card in a different name. Acquaintances told the New York Times in 2002 about her questionable manner, such as the way she dressed or how she would often say she was friends with people who did not know her. Among them, Phyllis Keitlen, a fundraiser for Denise Rich's charity, . claimed Nydia pledged $150,000, but 'when we tried to cash . the check, she stopped payment'. 'When I went after her, she gave me . false wire transfer numbers twice,' she continued. 'It was completely unfair what . she had done to Denise, whose daughter died of leukemia.' At the time, Neubauer responded: 'The people around me all wanted money. I spent a large amount of money... All these people came in like sharks... I felt pressure. 'Most of the checks did bounce. I can't deny that... I'm sorry the situation happened. It is my fault. But I never could believe these people were so devious.'","Nydia Neubauer pleaded guilty last year to charges including forgery and could get decades behind bars when she is sentenced on Tuesday .

"By . Joel Christie . An online community of shoplifting bloggers who brag about their 'hauls' and exchange advice on how best to steal from stores has been exposed, with the network quickly dubbed 'the internet's Bling Ring'. The once-under-the-radar 'lifters' - who have been likened to the seven L.A. teens who were charged for stealing from celebrity homes and immortalized in Sofia Coppola's Bling Ring - blog anonymously under names like Klepto Princess and Cash or Card and use hashtags such as #lifting and #fivefingerdiscount to link in with each other. The group were outed by a fellow blogger called We-unhallowed, who noticed the trend quietly percolating on Tumblr and decided to publish a list of the screen names involved. 'I've heard our and their generations called ''entitled'' but it's articulated really well here when you read their text posts about how they steal because they ''deserve nice things'',' she wrote, listing over 20 lifting accounts. Scroll down for video . #Haul: An underground network of mostly-girls and young women who boast about their shoplifting exploits online have been exposed, calling themselves 'lifters' The network of bloggers take to sites like Tumblr to post their 'hauls', which is the gaggle of stuff they have been able to lift. Seen here are expensive labels like Prada and Marni . The lifters blog anonymously and many feature disclaimers on their sites saying what they do 'is not true' in order to cover their tracks . One lifter said the lifter community has been bubbling for two years . Users are also fond of bragging about how much their collective 'haul' is worth by adding up the price tags of each stolen item . The lifting community have been likened to the seven L.A. teens who were charged for stealing from celebrity homes and immortalized in Sofia Coppola's film The Bling Ring . But while some of the group have lapped up their web infamy, others have hit back at the 'bratty' Bling Ring comparison. Stealer Moon, who was one of the bloggers named on the We-unhallowed list, said the assumption all those in the lifting community are 'white, well-off spoiled teens' was wide of the mark. 'I think the amount of girls who are white in this community are maybe ten or less, if that,' told Dazed. 'Many of us are young adults, many of us have jobs and work hard and still don't make ends meet.' Stealer Moon, who described herself as a Hispanic art school student, said the lifting community had been around for two years and contains about 100 active users. Other bloggers I spoke to estimate that there are only around one hundred active lifters in the community – the others are just curious onlookers. Stealer Moon said she struggled to find a part-time job while her parents covered her college loans and housing and turned to stealing 'from companies I was sure it wouldn't really hurt'. Before the lid was lifted on what they were doing, members of the network would share methods and stories with each other on how they steal, such as how to remove security tags using magnets and hooks, as well as what stores were easier than others. According to an expose on Jezebel, a variety of stores, from Macy's to Pac Sun and Ultra, were mentioned. The amount of stock boosted in one go is refereed to as a 'haul', and lifters would post pictures of their haul, along with how much it all cost, onto their blogs. Not limited to clothes: A heap of 'hauled' food - including packets of sushi - and other products sit atop a Chanel scarf . Lifters appear to have joined the community from all over the world, from major American cities to the midwest, from Australia to the UK . A stash of underwear and some clothes are posted to Tumblr . Make-up and accessories are a major part of the lifting community . 'Total damage since April 2014: $366.35' one wrote recently. Tumblr said they have no guidelines when it comes to posting shoplifting, but said they would cooperate should there be an investigation. 'Posts depicting potentially illegal activity may not, in and of themselves, violate our policies,' a spokesperson told Jezebel. Many of the Tumblr sites have shut since the list was made public on Wednesday, out of fear that, like the Bling Ring of burglars, they would be caught. 'It's really hard to wrap my head around the fact that I've gotten away with so much in the past few days,' one user, Lux Steals, wrote. Lifters say that once you get used to having free products and goods, its almost impossible to stop taking them . 'I feel extremely powerful, but at the same time, I feel like I'm going to be caught any second. I guess I don't make the most confident of shoplifters.' Another, Lil Lifter, wrote: 'sometimes im really afraid that the shoplifting community will be outed and become like a viral joke on the internet or something. 'imagine the embarrasment (sic) if you are identified and everyone at school/work and your neighbours (sic) and family finds out. 'hopefully it will never happen and im just being paranoid.'

"By . Ryan Gorman . The NBA wants the Sterling name scrubbed from Clippers ownership, at least according to superstar LeBron James. The Miami Heat forward said Sunday that no players want to play for either Donald Sterling, estranged wife Shelley Sterling, or any other member of the family. ‘As players, we want what's right and we don't feel like no one in his family should be able to own the team,’ he told the Miami Herald following an afternoon practice. Get out: Miami Heat forward LeBron James insists no players want to play for the Clippers if a member of the Sterling family controls the team . James’ comments came at about the same time an interview aired on ABC News with Shelley Sterling saying she’d fight to keep her ownership stake in the Clippers intact even if Donald Sterling is forced by the league to sell his half. ‘I will fight,’ she told Barbara Walters. ‘To be honest with you, I'm wondering if a wife of one of the owners, and there's 30 owners, did something like that, said those racial slurs, would they oust the husband? Or would they leave the husband in?’ James strongly criticized Sterling after the now-infamous recordings of him ranting racial slurs at V Stiviano were made public last month by TMZ and Deadspin. NBA commissioner Adam Silver last week banned Donald Sterling from the NBA for life and suggested he sell the team, but wife Shelley Sterling has been an outsized presence at the team’s home playoff games since. An owner’s committee voted only two days later to expedite the sale of the team and the league appointed former General Motors executive Dick parsons to run the team until it is sold. Donald Sterling has said he would fight any attempt to sell his interest in the team, and James said the league is up to the challenge. ‘At the end of the day, this is going to be a long litigation when it comes to that,’ James said. ‘This guy who's owned the team since the '80s is not going to just give the team up in a day. So we understand it's going to be long, but we want what's right.’ Donald Sterling bought the Clippers in 1981, he is the league’s longest-tenured owner.","The superstar forward said no member of the Sterling family is suitable to own the Clippers .
His remarks came at about the same time Shelley Sterling vowed to fight to keep her 50 per cent ownership stake in the team during a televised interview ."

Ginny Doyle, 44, was associate head women's basketball coach and Natalie Lewis, 24, director of basketball operations, are presumed dead after their balloon struck power lines and burst into flames over Caroline County, Virginia. The pilot of the doomed airship has been identified as Daniel T. Kirk, a retired U.S. Army officer with 30 years of flying experience. Investigators say Mr Kirk, the owner of Captain Kirk Starship Adventures, tried desperately to save the balloon after it caught fire. He opened to top vent to stop the fire from sending the craft even higher and took other emergency maneuvers before the basket and its three passengers separated from the from balloon and plummeted to Earth.

She had recently gotten engaged. Her parents flew to Richmond . from their home in Buffalo, New York, on Saturday. Doyle . tweeted earlier in the day that their takeoff was initially scheduled . for the morning but pushed back due to fog before later writing 'getting . ready to go up' only minutes before she died when the balloon she was . in burst into flames. The two women were originally supposed to liftoff in one of three balloons scheduled for a 6.30 a.m. voyage, Doyle said on Twitter. That trip was delayed until around 4.00 p.m. because of heavy fog. Doyle posted pictures Friday morning of her and Lewis in a hot air balloon that was tethered to the ground. The flight was not allowed to go up because of the fog. 'Getting ready to go up!' Doyle tweeted at 3.45 p.m. along with a picture of her and Lewis in front of the balloon that would eventually take their lives. At the University of Richmond, student athletes, faculty and administrators were in mourning. Two weekend baseball games were canceled and the university stopped commencement Saturday for a moment of silence to remember Doyle and Lewis, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reports. Awaiting her final ride: Doyle pictured alone in front of the hot air balloon's basket . Dead too soon: The 24-year-old Lewis shown not long before dying . Daniel T. Kirk executed several emergency maneuvers in an attempt to save the doomed balloon, investigators say . 'Words cannot begin to express our sorrow,' Richmond's athletics direction Keith Gill said in a statement. 'We are all stunned by the tragic news. Our thoughts and prayers go out to their loved ones.' The pilot of the doomed balloon was Daniel T. Kirk, his father Donald Kirk confirmed to NBC News. Kirk was a retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel, Donald Kirk said, who had been flying hot air balloons for 30 years and owned Captain Kirk Starship Adventures. The elder Kirk said he had gone up with his son more than 40 times and that Friday's crash was 'just a freak accident.' Horrified onlookers Friday heard the women screaming for help as they desperately jumped from the basket to escape the flames. 'Help me, help me, sweet Jesus, help. I'm going to die. Oh my God, I'm going to die,' witnesses reported hearing one of them scream as the basket and balloon separated. Lewis' remains have not yet been found, but her parents have arrived from Buffalo, New York, to help in the search effort despite teams suspending operations until Sunday due to darkness, the paper reported. 'The search continues for our beloved daughter and we remain hopeful and ask for your continued prayers,' parents Patricia and Evan Lewis Sr. said in a statement. The doomed flight was part of a VIP event Friday night meant to kick off the first balloon festival in the region in decades, according to the Times-Dispatch. 'Because of . the time that has transpired since the hot air balloon crash Friday . evening and the fact that we have not been able to make any contact with . any of the three occupants that were in the hot air balloon we are now . transitioning from a rescue operation to a recovery operation at this . time,' State Police spokeswoman Corinne Geller said Saturday morning. Fiery crash: This hot air balloon carrying at least three people caught fire mid-flight and went down in Virginia . Frantic: The pilot reportedly started taking the necessary security precautions like trying to open the top of the balloon because the fire would cause the balloon to travel higher faster . Before the split: At one point after the explosion, the basket and the balloon separated . Under investigation: Heidi Moats, a National Transportation Safety Board investigator, briefed on the recovery operation Saturday afternoon . The discovery of the second body came a few hours after the press conference. 'Just before midnight we were able to locate one of the occupants. 'We . do know who was on the - the two passengers and the pilot- we have been . in contact with their families overnight but at this point we are not . going to identify which one of those occupants has been recovered.' Heidi Moats, a National Transportation Safety Board investigator, briefed on the recovery operation Saturday afternoon. The names of the individuals have not been officially released, but local newspaper The Henrico Citizen has reported that the two passengers were members of the University of Richmond women's basketball coaching staff. The team's website names the male head coach and five female assistant coaches. The . incident took place at around 8pm at the Meadow Event Park in Caroline . County - the site of the Mid-Atlantic Balloon Festival. An . eyewitness reported seeing one or two balloons drifting into power . lines and bursting into flames in the skies over Carmel Church Road. Three . balloons took off at the same time and the first two had no issues with . their landing, but that wasn't the case for the third. 'As . the third balloon made its descent, it made contact with a live . utility wire. That in turn sparked a fire with the hot air balloon,' Ms . Geller said. Final moments: Festival goer Nancy Johnson posted this image on her Instagram account showing the explosive balloon (far left) before the fire . Desperate: The balloon that caught fire was the third in a group of three that were due to land at a festival but after the other two made safe descents, the third balloon hit a utility wire and caught fire . 'The . fire spread quickly the pilot of the hot air balloon, based on witness . accounts and the other pilots who were on the ground, began doing his . various safety maneuvers and trying to manage the fire.' She . said that witnesses saw the pilot 'try to open up the top of the . balloon which is standard procedure because the added heat and intensity . of the fire will actually make the balloon rise faster so he was taking . every effort he could to manage and extinguish the fire.' People who were present at the event recalled seeing some passengers leaping from the basket. 'According . to witnesses they say they heard an explosion and it was after that . that the basket and the balloon actually separated,' Ms Geller said. 'We are still in the process- and we spent all night- searching for the wreckage, the basket, the balloon.' Carrie . Hager-Bradley said she saw the balloon in flames on her way home from . the grocery store and heard people yelling, according to WWBT TV. Search continues: Virginia State Police spokeswoman Corine Geller (left) said that the search went on through the night with helicopters (right) and will continue through Saturday with the aid of hundreds of state troopers . 'They were just screaming for anybody to help them,' the station quoted her as saying. ‘We saw black smoke coming from an object,’ eyewitness Cole Holocker told NBC News. ‘Couldn't tell what it was. We thought it might be exhaust from a . helicopter around the base and then, when we came close to it, we could . see it was a balloon.’ The . 18-year-old college student added that he saw the structure of the . balloon collapse before it plummeted to the ground, landing behind the . tree line. Festival goer Nancy Johnson posted a photo on her Instagram account showing the ill-fated balloon right before the fire. Some hot air balloons landed . safely in Debra Ferguson's yard, she was quoted by The Free Lance-Star . of Fredericksburg, Virginia, as saying. She said one of the men in the balloons pointed up at another still in the air and said he thought it might be in trouble. Investigators gather near a farm in Virginia as they were searching for missing hot air balloon on Friday night . 'As soon as we looked up, the thing blew up right there,' the newspaper quoted Ferguson as saying. ""All I heard was, ""Oh my God, Oh my God,"" and all you saw was the top of the balloon still flying, but all of the basket was gone. All of the flames just disappeared. ... It was like a match — poof — and then it was gone.' Caroline County resident Paula Dustin said she and her family and a friend were watching the balloons inflate and take off when they saw one in the distance that appeared to be in distress. 'We saw a glow, and you could tell the bottom of the balloon was in flames,' Dustin was quoted by the newspaper as saying.","Two passengers and the pilot were on board at the time of the Friday evening crash outside of Richmond, Virginia .

"By . Leon Watson . The notorious king of New York’s Club Kids who was jailed for murdering his drug dealer has told how he feels nothing but 'shame and disgust' at his crime. Michael Alig, whose life was portrayed by Macaulay Culkin in the 2003 movie Party Monster, was freed last week after serving more than 17 years in prison. Alig, now 48, who masterminded some of the most extravagant parties of the early Nineties, pleaded guilty to bludgeoning the winged drug dealer Andre 'Angel' Menendez to death in 1996. Scroll down for more . Michael Alig, the notorious king of New York’s Club Kids in the late 1980s who went to prison for murdering his drug dealer in 1996, has been freed on bail . Michael Alig and James St James. The pair masterminded some of the most extravagant parties of the early Nineties . He then poured bleach into his mouth, dismembered his body with knives and disposed of his corpse in the Hudson River. 'Eighteen years on, looking back at the person I was, I feel nothing but shame and disgust,' he said in an interview with the New York Post. 'I . was a selfish junkie who killed another human being. But that's not the . Michael Alig I am today, or the Michael Alig I was before I became an . addict: the misfit from South Bend, Indiana, who came to New York in search of acceptance, opportunity and a whole lot of fun.' His accomplice, roommate Robert Riggs, otherwise known as 'Freeze', was also sentenced to 10 to 20 years in prison after he confessed to manslaughter. Originally from Indiana, Alig moved to New York in the early 1980s to attend Fordham University but later dropped out and became involved in the New York underground club scene as a promoter. Even before his conviction, Alig and his fellow Club Kids had grabbed national attention for their outrageous Manhattan dance parties that showcased sex, rampant drug use and over-the-top costumes. Macaulay Culkin's portrayal of Alig assisted his cultish rise to international fame, particularly in London . Party Monster, the 2003 fiction account of Alig's life starred Macaulay Culkin as infamous NYC club promoter Michael Alig, right, and Seth Green as his friend James St. James . Drug dealer Andre 'Angel' Melendez was brutally murdered and his body dismembered by Alig and Robert Riggs . The story of Alig's rise and fall was . first told in the 1999 book Disco Bloodbath written by his best friend . and fellow Club Kid James St James. The book detailed St James’ friendship with Alig and how it fell apart as Alig's drug addiction worsened and ended after the death of Melendez. It later became the basis for Party Monster, the 2003 fiction account of Alig’s life starring Culkin and Seth Green as St. James. Parole officers allegedly denied Alig parole in 2006 after watching the debauched movie. A cult hit, the film has helped maintain interest in Alig and despite nearly two decades behind bars he has 11.7K followers on Twitter. According to his blog 'he has had many offers of work, and even more requests for interviews and shows.' His social media accounts were maintained by a friend while Alig was inside, although he has tweeted several times since his release on Monday morning. ‘Just narrowly escaped being re-arrested for having my release filmed but we’re ok and in (sic) our way to nyc! #narrowescape,' he tweeted of his departure from prison. 'Happy to be free and so grateful for this second chance. Can’t wait 2C @JSJDarling at dinner. #frenemy.'

"By . Julian Robinson . First time buyers usually prepare themselves for a leap of faith when their dream property comes on the market. But a Chinese estate agency brought a whole new meaning to the phrase 'jumping at the chance' when it launched a bizarre marketing ploy. A sales office in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, held a standing long jump event, giving buyers various discounts depending on how far they were able to leap. On your marks: A house buyer limbers up ahead of his standing jump in a bid to knock hundreds of pounds off the price of his home . A man leaps through the air from a standing jump at a sales office in Nanjing, China as he looks to get the biggest possible discount from the estate agency . Touchdown: a man gets ready to plant his feet after taking on a standing jump. A leap of between 2m and 2.5m would net contestants  8000 Yuan (£760) The further the buyer jumped the bigger the discount they received. For a discount of 5,000 Yuan (£474) the buyer had to jump 1.5m to 2m. For a saving of 8000 Yuan (£760) the jumping distance was between 2m to 2.5m and for a distance of 2.5m you could expect a 10,000 Yuan (£950) discount. Champion jumpers who managed more than 3m could look forward to 20,000 Yuan (£1,898) off the price of their property. House buyers gather to take part in a standing jump at an estate agents in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province with the promise of big discounts for long leaps. 300 people took part in the event, with most saving hundreds of pounds . But the largest discount available on the day was 100,000 Yuan (£9,496) which required a distance of at least 4m. According to the sales office 300 buyers took part and most people secured a 5,000 to 8,000 Yuan discount. Meanwhile, a few got a 10,000 Yuan discount and one person doubled this by knocking off 20,000 Yuan with one giant leap.","China estate agency offers discounts based on standing long-jump ability .

"By . Francesca Chambers . Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel said today he is 'open' to reviewing the U.S. military's policy on transgender service in the military. Hagel called the issue 'complicated because it has a medical component to it,' while indicating that the department tasked with overseeing the nation's armed forces is willing to reconsider its ban. 'I do think it continually should be reviewed,' Hagel said. 'I'm open to that, by the way. I’m open to those assessments.' U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel says he is 'open' to reviewing the military's policy on transgender service - something that the armed services do not currently allow . Transgender troops have quietly been calling on the military to remove its ban since the government repealed its Don't Ask Don't Tell Policy that disallowed gay and lesbian individuals from serving in the military. After Hagel spoke at a Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Pride . (LGBT) pride event at the Pentagon last summer, those in favor of . lifting the ban hoped it was a sign of progress on the issue. But nothing changed in the months after. The . Department of Defense's current policy is to allow transgender people to . serve in civilian positions, but not in the armed services. The military cites medical reasons as the cause for disbarment. A March report commissioned by former U.S. Surgeon General to Bill Clinton Jocelyn Elders on behalf of San Francisco State University's Palm Center posits that 'there is no medical reason for the ban. Elders says the ban 'expensive, damaging and unfair . barrier to health care access for the approximately 15,450 transgender . personnel who serve currently in the active, Guard and reserve . components.' The report estimates that if the military allowed individuals wishing to undergo sex changes to stay in the service, it would affect approximately 230 members of the service and 'would place almost no burden on the military.' Each sex change operation would cost the government $30,000, it says. Former . Navy SEAL Team 6 Chris Beck, who now goes by Kristin Beck, has proposed a . pilot program that would give service members in the process of . changing their sex a year to complete the emotional and physical transition in return for two years of additional service. The report had no visible effect on military policy when it was published. ''At this time there are no plans to change the department's policy and . regulations which do not allow transgender individuals to serve in the . U.S. military,' Defense Department spokesman Navy Lt. Cmdr. Nate Christensen said. Hagel's remarks to ABC News on Sunday may signal that the military has shifted positions on the issue. 'Every . qualified American who wants to serve our country should have an . opportunity, if they fit the qualifications and can do it,' Hagel told ABC's Martha Raddatz. 'This is an . area that we’ve not defined enough.' If the U.S. changed its policy, it would join a host of other countries that allow transgender individuals to serve, including Great Britain, Canada, Israel, Spain and Sweden.","The U.S. military does not allow transgender individuals to serve in the military .

The boys' frantic parents found the toddlers and called 9-1-1. Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said it appears as though the adults in the house had lost track of the boys - the father of one of the boy's was in the house watching a movie upstairs as one of their mothers was downstairs.

Judd told reporters that the father who was upstairs thought the boys were downstairs, while the mother thought they were upstairs.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A second woman has been charged in the 2006 cold case murder of an Oklahoma teenager who's body was discovered only days after his high school graduation. Dayna Marie Hargrove, 27, was arrested Friday for her alleged part in the death of Jarret Clark. She was booked into Wagoner County Jail on conspiracy to commit first degree murder, murder in the first degree, conspiracy to commit conspiracy after the fact in first degree murder, and being an accessory after the fact, KJRH reports. Arrested within a week of one another, Courtney Manzer and Danya Marie Hargrove face first degree murder charges in the 2006 cold case death of Jarret Clark . Clark, an 18-year-old Broken Arrow High School student, was found dead in Fort Gibson Lake. The medical examiner listed his cause of death as drowning, according to News On 6. Authorities discovered that Clark had sustained several blows to the back of his head before drowning. Another man, Anthony Scott Wallen, later admitted to the beating. It's believed that after Clark was unconscious, Miller parked in a 'lookout position' while co-conspirators put Clark's body in a pickup truck then sent him into the lake. Jarret Clark, 18, had only just graduated high school a few days before his body was discovered in Fort Gibson Lake . Miller later lied to investigators about Clark being intoxicated and exactly who was at the campsite. The case lay dormant until earlier this week when Courtney Manzer, 24, was arrested and charged with first degree murder.

"By . Julian Robinson . Mauricio Melendez has seen his conviction for first degree murder overturned after a judge ruled his lawyers gave ineffective assistance . A Las Vegas man facing a life sentence for murdering his wife has seen his conviction overturned – after a judge ruled that his trial lawyers were ineffective. Mauricio Melendez was initially found guilty of first degree murder with a deadly weapon after his wife Chennel was found with a bullet wound to the head in a Las Vegas apartment in 2008. But even though Nevada Supreme Court affirmed the conviction in August 2011, a district judge has agreed that the performance of the 40-year-old’s lawyers at the time means the trial was ‘unfair’. In a written decision, District Judge Abbi Silver said: ‘Taken as a whole, the performance of trial counsel fell below any objective standard of reasonableness to such an extent that it rendered the verdict unreliable and the trial unfair.’ When police were called to a flat near Tropicana Avenue and Markway Avenue in Las Vegas on August 7, 2008, they found 33-year-old Chennel Melendez dead on a sofa. Melendez was represented by Christy Craig and Scott Coffee from the County Public Defender's Office during his 2009 trial, according to the Las Vegas Review Journal. He later filed a petition claiming his attorneys had given him ineffective counsel having conceded his guilt a trial. District Judge Silver added: ‘In her opening statement, Ms Craig assured the jury that the death of Chennel Melendez was an accident, and that there would be absolutely no evidence of motive or evil intent. ‘(Melendez) proclaimed his innocence, testifying that the shooting was accidental. However, Mr. Coffee, in his very last statement to the jury, conceded his client’s guilt, telling the jury they should convict him of manslaughter.’ She said that explaining to the jury that Melendez was guilty of manslaughter ‘undermined’ the credibility of the defence case. Clark County Court where District Judge Abbi Silver has ruled that the verdict in the trial of Mauricio Melendez was 'unreliable' And she added that the defence team should have used an expert at the trial to support the claim that it was an accidental shooting. Scott Coffee, who has spent 20 years in the Clark County Public Defender’s office, told the Review Journal that his team always maintained the shooting was unintentional and that lawyers often had to change their strategy during trials. Public Defender Phil Kohn described the two lawyers as ‘excellent’ adding that they were prepared for the trial. Melendez will stay in custody while prosecutors appeal the District Judge’s ruling.","Mauricio Melendez convicted of first degree murder after wife found dead .

"By . Joshua Gardner . and Associated Press . Six women filed suit against San Diego's The Rock Church on Thursday, saying they were sexually harassed at a drug and alcohol recovery program associated with the megachurch. The lawsuit says the Rock offered counseling and housing to women in a program led by David Powers, who is accused of repeatedly fondling residents and making lewd sexual advances and laying atop at least one of the recovering drug addicts as she slept. ‘They’ve gone there to seek healing and what they get is a sex fest,’ attorney Irwin Zalkin, who’s helping represent the women, told NBC San Diego. ‘I mean, that’s really what this place is -- it’s a cesspool of sex.’ Accused: David and Tina Powers run several San Diego drug rehab facilities and were accused in a civil suit filed Thursday of turning their sober living homes into a 'cesspool of sex' Among the six plaintiffs are former Powers employee Andria Donovan (left) and former patient Jaycee Peacock, who both claim to have been repeatedly groped and harassed by the born again Christian . 'I was terrified if I told anyone I wouldn¿t be able to complete my treatment': 20-year-old recovering heroin addict Taylor Peyton of Ohio first filed the suit and alleges that Powers harassed her repeatedly in the months leading up to January, when she claims she left Soledad House after Powers penetrated her vagina with his fingers . The lawsuit names The Rock Church, David Powers, Powers’ company ABC Sober Living and Powers’ wife Tina Powers and seeks damages for sexual battery, sexual harassment and other claims. Plaintiff Taylor Peyton, a 20-year-old who entered ABC Sober Living’s Soledad House for heroin addiction in September 2013, says that Powers’ lewd behaviour began almost immediately. The two of them were alone in a golf cart when Peyton says the then 54-year-old program leader asked if she could feel the ‘sexual tension’ between them. ‘I literally just ran out of the golf cart. I didn’t know what he was talking about,’ the Ohio native told BuzzFeed. Peyton alleges that the harassment escalated until Powers began to come into her room, lay on her sleeping body, and grope her breasts and buttocks. She claims she finally parted ways with the rehab center and its leader when Powers 'penetrated her with his fingers, then put her hand on his penis and asked her to stimulate him,' according to BuzzFeed. Megachurch: Powers' company ABC Sober Living has close ties with The Rock Church, a 12,000 member megachurch founded in 2000 by former San Diego Charger Miles McPherson, who is not named in the suit. The Rock Church has admitted no wrongdoing and distanced itself from Powers since the suit was filed . If the accusations of Peyton and her five fellow plaintiffs are to be believed, Powers has a years-long history of this type of behavior. ‘As soon as I arrived, David began making inappropriate comments to me. Soon enough, he was slapping my butt and walking into the room when I was naked,’ Jaycee Peacock, who entered Soledad House in July 2012, told NBC San Diego. ‘David made disgusting sexual comments and found a way to touch me every single day that I was there,’ Peacock said. Peacock and Peyton are joined in their suit by former patients Hannah Paul, Jane Roe and Mary Catherin Grayson as well as a former employee of Powers' Andria Donovan. David Powers denied the allegations in a length statement that says, in part: . ‘At the end of January 2014 a female resident with mental health issues alleged that while she lived in a facility other than ours that one of our principals imposed himself on her in a sexual manner. We categorically deny this allegation. ‘We take things of this nature very seriously and we have always had a zero tolerance for this type of behavior. We have been helping people get sober for 17 years and this is the first time a rumor of this kind has ever come up.’ 'David made disgusting sexual comments and found a way to touch me every single day that I was there,' claims Peacock . Jaycee Peacock, Taylor Peyton, Hannah Paul, Jane Roe, Mary Catherin Grayson and former Powers employee Andria Donovan are suing David and Tina Powers, their company ABC Sober Living and 12,000 member The Rock megachurch in a civil suit that claims the Powers created a 'cesspool of sex' out of their string of sober living homes in San Diego. All accused parties have denied wrongdoing. The suit claims the following: . Source: NBC San Diego . It’s possible the resident the statement refers to is plaintiff Jane Roe, who claims that in September 2011 she awoke to find Powers’ employee Fred Murray groping her thighs and calves. Roe claims that when she alerted Tina Powers of the issue, she threatened to expel Roe from the program. Court documents also allege that Tina and David Powers would have sex with their bedroom door open while hosting women in their home. The Rock Church said the accusations are troubling but that none of the alleged behavior occurred on its property or by anyone under its authority. The church said it stopped referring women to Powers' ABC Sober Living after learning of the allegations Monday. The Rock was formed in 2000 and says about 12,000 people attend its Sunday services. It is led by founder Miles McPherson, a former defensive back for the San Diego Chargers, who is not named as a defendant. The lawsuit filed in San Diego Superior Court names Rock Church Ministries, ABC Sober Living and David and Tina Powers as defendants. It says the church's ""Rock Recovery Ministry"" featured Powers' residential treatment programs. An October 2009 video posted to YouTube by the church names David and Tina Powers ‘Rock Heroes’ for that month ‘for their outstanding dedication, sacrificial service, and faithful evangelism.’ San Diego police conducted an investigation involving Powers and a woman and decided against pursuing criminal charges, said Lt. Mike Holden, who declined to name the woman. Tina Powers is also named in the lawsuit and is accused of threatening to expel a woman who voiced concern over the alleged harassment at one of the San Diego sober houses. The suit also claims she and Powers had sex in their bedroom with the door open while hosting women at their home .","Taylor Peyton, Andria Donovan and Jaycee Peacock and three other women allege that David Powers is a serial sex abuser in the civil suit .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A woman who scaled the heights of the male-dominated boxing profession before quitting in the face of derision over controversial calls in two world championship bouts has denied taking bribes in exchange for making ‘unpopular decisions’. Thrice-divorced, 65-year-old grandmother Cynthia Jo ‘CJ’ Ross spent more than 30 years working as a boxing judge before walking away from the sport she loved late last year. She is currently living alone in the Nevada desert after her fiancé died and is trying to rebuild her life. During her impressive career she worked her way up through the ranks from officiating amateur boxing program to world championship bouts in Las Vegas. Thrice-divorced, 65-year-old grandmother Cynthia Jo ¿CJ¿ Ross spent more than 30 years working as a boxing judge before walking away from the sport she loved late last year . Her first professional fight was in Reno in 1992 and when her third husband’s job moved them to Vegas not long after, it provided her with the perfect opportunity to work more fights with better fighters in the boxing-mad city. Ross was assigned her first title fight in 1999 and by 2012 had worked nearly 500 fights over 20 years including at least 65 bouts competing for a championship belt. ‘I took my time going through the ranks,’ she told Buzzfeed. ‘I was never one to push or to ask for anything.’ Then in July 2012 her glorious career suffered a knockout blow from which it never really recovered. Ross was asked to judge a WBO welterweight title bout between Filipino champ Manny Pacquiao and American challenger Timothy Bradley at Las Vegas' MGM Grand. Pacquiao, the only fighter in the sport’s history to win world titles in eight divisions was heavy favorite, while Bradley was a 7-2 underdog. Ross was hounded by the boxing press and via fans on social media sites for her controversial scoring of the June 2012 fight between Timothy Bradley, right, and Manny Pacquiao, left . The fight went the distance and the pundits were all agreed that Pacquiao appeared to have done more than enough to win despite slowing in the later stages. Instead Pacquiao famously lost his belt to Bradley after a controversial split decision. Everyone was left stunned after two of the judges – including Ross - scored the bout 115-113 to the unbeaten Bradley, while the other handed the win to Pacquiao by the same score. The fallout was harsh for Ross. As well as being hounded by the boxing media she received personal attacks on social media. Angry fans found her Facebook page and she was sent disturbing photos of the butt of a gun and of a cigarette with a bullet in it. Despite the harassment, Ross still stands by her decision to award the fight to Bradley, rather than fan’s favorite Pacquiao. ‘There was more noise for Pacquiao throughout the fight, so you would expect them to be disappointed,’ she said. Floyd Mayweather Jr. said 'What the f**k is this?' in the ring after the announcer read Ross', far right, scorecard . Boxing is a sport beset by stories of mob involvement and gambling through the years. Questions were asked of the apparently bizarre decisions of the judges, but no evidence was ever found that Ross was on the take. In fact, Francisco Valcarcel, president of WBO, told BuzzFeed that Ross ‘was very professional and she was very good.’ In spite of the uproar that surrounded Ross’ decision, she returned to the ringside and over the next 15 months, she judged 37 fights, 10 of them with a championship at stake. The came the fight that was to finish of her career once and for all. In Sept 14, 2013, she was assigned a championship bout between Floyd ‘Money’ Mayweather - boxing’s biggest draw and the world’s highest-paid athlete in the world - and undefeated challenger Saul ‘Canelo’ Alvarez. Again the match went the distance, but this time Ross was on her own in scoring it as a draw, while the other two judges - and most observers - had judged it a decisive win for Mayweather. No sooner was her scoring made public, than a tidal wave of vitriol was unleashed upon Ross. Manny Pacquiao of the Philippines, left, defeated Timothy Bradley, right, in a recent rematch of their WBO welterweight title match . The fighter himself couldn't contain his dismay at Ross’ decision. ‘What the f**k is this?’ he said in the ring after the announcer read Ross’ scorecard. Alvarez himself said, 'I recognize that he beat me.' Alvarez’s promoter, Richard Schaefer of Golden Boy Promotions, called Ross’ scorecard a 'disgrace.' ESPN analyst Teddy Atlas raised the question that perhaps foul play was to blame. ‘That criminal, that corrupt … incompetent, whatever you want to call her,’ he told SportsCenter. ‘This is the second time she’s done this.’ ‘It speaks to the corruption of the sport,’ he continued. ‘The criminals will be rewarded.’ Two days later, Ross sent an email to the Nevada Athletic Commission informing them that she planned to leave the sport indefinitely. 'I will be taking some time off from boxing but will keep in touch,' she wrote. A friend claims that Ross was victimized because she was a woman working in a male-dominated profession . Again no evidence has ever been uncovered that lends any credibility to Atlas’ comments. Since quitting the sport, Ross has been spending time at her modest home in Pahrump, Nevada, where she moved after her third marriage ended in divorce in 2004. She had been engaged to be married before her fiancé suddenly died in 2009. 'What money?' she asked, when interviewed by Buzzfeed. 'Where’s this trail of money at? There isn’t enough to pay me off, even if it was millions.' 'I was pretty disgusted by the whole thing,' said Nick Zagala, a close friend. 'They were just piling on. And I think it’s totally because she’s a woman.' Shortly after the Mayweather debacle, she was also laid off from her job leading a workout class at a local gym. Ross, who enjoys wide-open . spaces and outdoor activities, now spends most of her time alone with nothing to do in the wilderness. 'I think I’m getting tired of the desert,' she told Buzzfeed. 'I’m going crazy here.'","Cynthia Jo 'CJ' Ross spent more than 30 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Ap . A Hawaii island oral and cosmetic surgeon with 27 formal complaints - including a man's death and a woman in a coma - is no longer allowed to practice in the state. Dr. John Stover voluntarily revoked his license and agreed not to be involved in any medical or dental procedures in Hawaii ever again. The Hawaii Medical Board voted to accept the settlement. Banned: Dr. John Stover has had 27 complaints filed against him in Hawaii - including complaints for the deaths of two people . Voluntary: Stover voluntarily turned over his licenses and agreed to not conduct any medical or dental procedures - the vote just made it official . 'The vote was seven in favor with one abstention,' Hawaii Medical Board Chairman Dr. Danny Takanishi, Jr., told Hawaii News Now. Meanwhile, former patient Kristen Tavares remains in a coma after a wisdom teeth extraction. Her father, Joe Tavares, said he's glad Stover won't work in Hawaii again. Another complaint against Stover involves the death of Curtis Wagasky. Wagasky, 52 at the time, was a homeless, disabled veteran who died three days after he went to Stover to have one tooth removed in December of 2012. An investigation conducted by HNN revealed that Wagasky had no serious previous medical problems before he went to Stover to have his tooth pulled. Closed for business: Stover closed his three dental practices in early April, including his Hilo office (pictured) Victim: Homeless military veteran Curtis Wagasky went to Stover to have one tooth pulled - he died three days later . Stover wrote in his report that Wagasky had become uncooperative, so he gave him an additional sedative. HNN says a former staff member in Stover's office claims that Stover knew Wagasky should not have been given the additional sedative - but he did it anyway. Wagasky died three days later - and because he had no family advocating for him, his death went univestigated; no autopsy was performed and there was no police report. Even though Stover closed his three offices on the Big Island last month, patients can still file legal actions against him. Waiting game: Kristen Tavares remains in a coma after she went into cardiac arrest during a routine dental procedure with Stover . Tragic: As her two children grow, Tavares remains in a coma . State Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs spokes­man Brent Suyama said it will be difficult for Stover to obtain a license anywhere else. The license revocation will go into a national registry. 'I would hope some people may take comfort in the fact that he is unable to practice any longer,' Suyama said. 'If something happens to your family members or yourself, I think it's difficult to feel any vindication in the regards. However, this does end this licensee's practice.'","One of Dr John Stover's former patients - a mother of two - remains in a coma .

"The prime suspect in the grisly 2004 murder of a 21-year-old performing arts student claims his alleged victim speaks to him from beyond the grave, as he maintains his innocence. In a bizarre interview Dimitry Sheinman told the New York Post that Juilliard student Sarah Fox loves him and is angry that her 'real killer' hasn't been caught. The young woman disappeared while jogging through Inwood Hill Park. Her strangled, naked body was found six days later, propped up and surrounded by two dozen yellow tulip petals. Residents suspected Sheinman because he regularly patrolled the park with his unleashed Rhodesian ridgeback, starting fights with people. Sinister: Dimitry Sheinman, pictured, was the prime suspect in the grisly 2004 murder of 21-year-old Sarah Fox . He became the 'No. 1 suspect,' after he told investigators he had a vision of the killer and offering up details that were never released publicly. However, investigators couldn't find any evidence linking him to the murder so he was never charged. He was now lives in Cape Town, South Africa with his wife and two daughters. According to The Post, a picture of Fox stares up from under the glass tabletop at his comfortable home. From the grave: He claims Fox, pictured, speaks to him from beyond the grave, as he maintains his innocence . 'You know when people ask, ""Does she communicate with you?"" Of course she does! Who else would she communicate with?' he told the newspaper. 'Let me show you the bastard now - I'm sorry, Sarah - you see, Sarah wants this guy's blood, but the tension energizes the table. She just f***ing wants his blood, man. 'Sometimes I walk by and she winks at me, you know. And she knows: ""I know exactly what you're doing, and I love you."" 'Right now she just looked at me and made a bunch of faces. She knows what's going on. I can't speak for her, but she knows exactly what's going on.' He then showed The Post a picture of the 'real killer' whom he told police about in 2012 after having a new vision of Fox's death. 'He's very scared. He's scared of me. I've never communicated with him directly but ... he's a disgusting, revolting man,' Sheinman said. 'Do I like him? Not much. He's a f***ing a**hole.' Investigators dismissed the suspect he named, because they'd already interviewed him and ruled him out. They still believe Sheinman is the culprit. 'I think it's him. There's no real doubt that it's him, but we haven't proved it yet,' said a police source close to the investigation told The Post. The 49-year-old moved to South Africa in 2006 and now works as a psychic healer. 'I don't do anything because I'm nice. I'm not nice,' Sheinman told The Post. 'I see healing as a selfish . activity because it makes me feel good. I have no choice but to heal. It . is what's been chosen for me. I have no choice but to heal; otherwise . I'd probably have to hurt people.' Investigation: An investigator looks for clues at the crime scene . Funeral: Lorraine Fox, center, along with family members and friends mourn the death of Fox's daughter on June 2, 2004 . Sheinman recalls falling 'into a trance' while detectives at the 34th Precinct station questioned him in 2004 and he saw the crime play out. 'At first I couldn't understand. I was confused. I was trying to help the police with their investigations, and then they began treating me as a suspect,' he said. 'I used to believe in the police, and in the state, but this showed me how useless everything was. The whole investigation was a f***ing mess.' His wife, Jane, told the newspaper that her family has been rocked by the allegations. 'They’ve treated us so terribly. The impact on our family has just been ... and for the girls!' she said, adding that she hopes their daughters, aged 8 and 11, can lead 'normal lives' in their adopted home.","In a bizarre interview, Dimitry Sheinman said that Juilliard student Sarah Fox loves him and is angry that her 'real killer' hasn't been caught .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Most family disputes don't make headlines. But most families don't have the last name of Guggenheim, and most disputes aren't over an art collection forth tens of millions of dollars. But that's exactly what's about to play out in a French courtroom after descendents of eccentric, millionaire art collector Peggy Guggenheim decided to sue the Guggenheim Foundation - to which Peggy left her vast collection of expensive art - over claims that the foundation is not honoring the wishes of the deceased heiress. Essentially, the family feels the foundation is cheapening the collection by allowing other artists to display their collections at an Italian palazzo in Venice that was left to the foundation as part of the collection. Dispute: The center of the dispute is this palazzo in Venice Guggenheim left to the Guggenheim Foundation . The palazzo is actually home to the tomb of Peggy Guggenheim - and 14 of her dogs. The last straw for the family appears to have come when the foundation put the names of Rudolph and Hannelore Schulhof on an entrance to the palazzo that also has the name of Guggenheim - and dogs with names like Cappuccino and Sir; Guggenheim's 'beloved babies,' according to the New York Times. The Schulhofs are the parents of Guggenheim Foundation trustee Michael Schulof, who included some of his family's collection with Guggenheim's at the Palazzo Venier dei Leoni in Venice. As is: The family claims the collection was to stay as it was when Guggenheim owned it, and the addition of names and artwork go against her wishes . 'They are totally disrespecting my great grandmother’s legacy,' Guggenheim's great grandson Sindbad Rumney, 27, told The Independent. 'Basically… . if you have [enough] money and you have a collection, you can show it . at the Peggy Guggenheim in Venice.' Guggenheim left her collection - at the time worth about $40 million - the the foundation in 1975, four years before her 1979 death. The family claims that the collection was given to the foundation on the condition that it stay together and not be altered in any way - not only does the family claim that pieces of the collection cannot be sold, they also claim pieces can't be added to the collection. According to the family, of the 181 pieces currently on display at the palazzo, 75 are from the recently added Schulhof collection. Eccentric: Peggy Guggenheim is the daughter of Benjammin Guggenheim, who left her a $2.5 million inheritance when he died in the sinking of the Titanic . Additionally, the family also accuses the foundation of desecrating Guggenheim's grave because her tomb is in the palazzo in what is now a 'sculpture garden' that is often used for cocktail parties. What once was Guggenheim's grave is now 'The Nasher Sculpture Garden' - named after Texas billionaires Patsy and Raymond Nasher. Rumney's mother, art writer Laurence Tacou, told Paris Match that the foundation was using the Venice palazzo as 'an extraordinary cash machine' and that it should be turned over to a non-profit committee. The foundation, however, claims there were no specific demands made by Guggenheim about how her collection was to be used. Memorial: The names of some of Guggenheim's dogs - like Cappuccino and Sir - can also be found at the palazzo . '[Our] efforts have only honoured, preserved and enhanced the memory and . reputation of Peggy Guggenheim,' Betsy Ennis, a Guggenheim . spokeswoman, told The Independent. Why is a dispute over something in Italy being resolved in a French court? As the publication explains, 'Like any good family quarrel, this one goes back a long way. The French . judicial system declared itself competent to intervene when two . “branches” of the Guggenheim family last fell out 22 years ago. Seven of . Peggy Guggenheim’s Paris-based descendants have now asked the French . courts to intervene again.'","The family claims a palazzo Peggy Guggenheim donated to the Guggenheim Foundation isn't being used as the heiress intended .

"By . Tara Brady . Inception-style lucid dreams can be induced by applying a specific frequency of electric current to sleepers' brains, a study has found. Lucid dreams involve a state of heightened awareness that allows the sleeper to recognise the dream and control what happens within it. A similar concept was explored in the hit movie Inception, starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Dreams involving a state of heightened awareness were explored in the movie Inception starring Leonardo DiCaprio . People who have lucid dreams talk of 'waking up' within a dream and being able, for instance, to fly at will or manipulate the imaginary world around them. In the new study, researchers tested 27 participants with no previous experience of lucid dreaming over several nights. After three minutes of uninterrupted Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep - the sleep phase when most dreaming occurs - a weak alternating electric current was applied to their scalps. The scientists targeted the frontal and temporal brain regions where high-frequency 'gamma' brainwaves had previously been associated with lucid dreaming. Stimulation at a frequency of 40 hertz both raised gamma activity and induced lucid dreaming . A few seconds after the brain stimulation the volunteers were awakened and reported having lucid dreams. Stimulation at a frequency of 40 hertz both raised gamma activity and induced lucid dreaming. It also correlated with specific aspects of lucid dreams, such as insight - realising you are dreaming - control over the dream plot, and dissociation from the dream's protagonist. Writing in the journal Nature Neuroscience, the team led by Dr Ursula Voss, from the JW Goethe-University in Frankfurt, Germany, speculated on the use of lucid dreams to help victims of post-traumatic stress disorder who are plagued by nightmares. 'Promoting gamma oscillations during REM sleep in post-traumatic stress disorder with re-emerging nightmares might trigger lucid dreaming and eventually enable active changes in dream content,' said the researchers.","Lucid dreams allows the sleeper to control what happens .

The 47-year-old, who has nine daughters and ten sons ranging from three to 26 years old with her husband Jim Bob, 48, writes in her blog for TLC that she spends an average of $3,000 a month on groceries. On her family's website she details some of the money-saving meals she likes to rustle up including Broccoli Casserole, Poor Man's Pizza and Three Bean Chilli. Keeping it cheap: 19 Kids and Counting star Michelle Duggar has revealed that she sticks to a $5 per person daily food budget in her bustling household . To save on shopping, Mrs Duggar says she shops for ingredients at discount stores, warehouse clubs and co-ops. She mainly buys in bulk, stocking up once a month on staples including butter, cereal and oats. She will return every three to four days to purchase fresh produce. 'You can save thousands of dollars by doing just that,' the devout Christian matriarch notes. Although she maintains a close rein on the purse strings, Mrs Duggar says she used to be much stricter. Inside the Duggar's pantry: To save on shopping, the family shop for ingredients in bulk at discount stores, warehouse clubs and co-ops . Form an orderly queue! Due to the large size of their family, the Duggars have a deli counter in their kitchen . Just a year ago she was spending around $2,000 every month on food. However, higher food prices meant she had to up her spending. Growing children were another factor. She humorously writes: 'Our boys have grown a lot and they have hollow legs. Josiah, Jedidiah, Jeremiah, and Jason are all tall and lanky. 'I jokingly say every two hours we have to fill up those hollow legs to make them grow a few more inches.' When there are family get-togethers there are even more mouths to feed as Mr and Mrs Duggar also have three grandchildren, from their eldest son, Joshua, 26, who married Anna in September 2008 and moved out of home.

Thanks to keeping a close eye on their finances the Duggars -  who will mark their 30th wedding anniversary this July - pride themselves on living debt free. Along with watching what they eat, the couple shop for clothes at thrift stores, scour Craigslist for furniture, and have never brought a new car. Mrs Duggar concludes: 'I'm willing to wait for a little bit to buy things we need. We've already decided we won't go into debt to buy things. 'If our couch wears out, I know I've got $65 to spend on a couch and we’ll look around.

The Duggars first entered the spotlight in 2008 on TLC's show 17 and Counting - a series which followed the life of Michelle and Jim Bob and their then 17 - now 19 - children. The family is conservative Christian and has strong beliefs about issues such as contraception, home-schooling, and spending very little time on the internet or watching TV. They are considered representative of the Quiverfull movement which 'teaches that children are God’s blessing and that husbands and wives should happily welcome every child they are given.' Addressing their critics, Mr Duggar once said: 'People think we are overpopulating the world [but] we are following our convictions.' He and his wife announced last year that they were actively trying for another child before their 50th birthdays.","The devout Christian spends an average of $3,000 a month on groceries .

A 41-year-old anime voice actor and drama teacher from Houston started a sexual relationship with one of his 16-year-old students and when police caught on, he took her to Las Vegas and married her - with her mother's consent, police say. Investigators believe Ilich Guardiola was trying to cover his tracks when he took the girl and her mother to a quickie wedding in Nevada - one week after the teen told police that she and her teacher were 'in love.' Guardiola was arrested Thursday at his apartment in Spring Valley, Texas - in front of his new teenage bride. He cannot . be prosecuted for any sexual contact that he had with the girl after . they were married - it's a legally binding union. However, police believe he also he and the girl were together before they were married. Officers stopped Guardiola for speeding on April 14 with the girl in his car. He said he was simply taking her home. But . her story didn't match up. She eventually told officers that she and . Guardiola were 'in love' and that they had had sex at his apartment at . least two times. When officers confiscated Guardiola's phone, they found multiple text messages between the two, including one in which the girl told him 'I love having sex with you.' Guardiola recently directed and starred alongside his teenage lover in a production of the children's play 'Freckleface Strawberry' He is a teacher, director and actor at the Houston Family Arts Center - a community theater organization whose mission is to provide 'a safe and encouraging environment that fosters creativity, respect, personal growth, and character development' for children and teens. In March, Guardiola starred alongside the girl in the children's theater . production of 'Freckleface Strawberry.' He also directed the play. The girl's mother told police she knew Guardiola was with her daughter - but said he was only supposed to be giving her a ride home. However, . according to court documents, she was present in Las Vegas when . Guardiola married her 16-year-old daughter eight days later on April 22 - despite an age . difference of 25 years. Children as young as 16 are allowed to marry in both Texas and Nevada - so long as they have the permission of a parent. Police told KHOU-TV that the mother agreed to the marriage because she was afraid that reporting the relationship would hurt her daughter's future acting career. Life imitating art? Guardiola voiced an anime character in the show Air Gear that had a young girl as a lover . In addition to his job as a drama teacher, Guardiola is a well-known voice actor for English translations of Japanese anime. He has played minor roles in several animated movies and TV shows, including One Piece and Area 88. In one role, he voiced an older character who had seduced a young female companion. Guardiola has been married twice before. His first wife, Kaytha Coker, told MailOnline she ended her marriage of seven years to the actor because she suspected he had been unfaithful. She said Guardiola called her several weeks ago and asked for the phone number of a brother-in-law, who is an attorney. He told her that he had been stopped by the police taking a student home and that the officers had seized his phone. 'He didn't think they could do that,' she said.

"By . Damien Gayle . Scroll down for video . The Spanish fight bulls for sport, but in Switzerland the cows are more likely to duke it out between themselves. These pictures show cows clashing at the grand final of Switzerland's 'Combats de Reines' ('Battle of the Queens') competition in Aproz, in the western Canton of Valais. Unlike bullfighting - where humans fight bulls, often to the death - the Swiss spectator sport pitches cows against each other in a bovine battle for supremacy. Locking horns: Two cows fight during the traditional annual 'Combats de Reines', in Aproz, Valais, Switzerland . Although the formally organised events began less than 100 years ago, cow fighting is said to be an ancient tradition in Switzerland. The fighting cows are drawn from the feisty Eringer breed, common in Valais, which are robust and possess the singular characteristic of fighting among themselves for supremacy within the herd. Comparatively small-bodied, brown and black-coated and with curved white horns, the cows are these days bred specially for combat, rather than milk or meat. Their horns are blunted before . competition, so the fights are mainly a contest of pushing and shoving, . with losers determined by the first cow to back down. It's the Moo-FC: Thousands of spectators look on as Daisy and Bluebell duke it out in the arena . The fighting cows, always females, are drawn from the feisty and robust Eringer breed, common in Valais . Still, despite their competitive instinct, it can sometimes be difficult to provoke the usually placid cows into combat. Once in the arena, they often need prodding, and even then they are sometimes more interested in chewing the cud or exploring the daisies. If a cow refuses to fight, she is eliminated. But other times all the cows will fight at once, in a cacophony of mooing, stamping and locking horns. However, unlike the notorious Spanish equivalent, blood is rarely spilt. Despite their competitive instinct, it can sometimes be difficult to provoke the usually placid cows into combat . Winners are awarded special cowbells and are crowned 'Queen' and the winner of the grand final dubbed 'Queen of queens'. It's a coveted prize; the pinnacle of a breeder's career. The achievement will not only earn them local fame, but also secure a bumper fee of up to ten times the going rate for any calf born to the winning cow. But despite the plaudits, and cash, up for grabs, breeders admit its not really possible to train the cows how to fight. All they can do is feed the animals and make sure they stay in good shape. 'The rest is up to the cows - fighting is in their blood. They love it,' says one.","Cow fighting is a Swiss tradition, but arranged fights began last century .

Centerville police officer Jeremy Veach thankfully had time to hit the ground before the oak could harm him too badly, though an inch or a few seconds difference could have meant his life. 'I heard a couple cracks,' Veach recalled. 'A very loud pop. In hindsight, I had time to think, ""Holy cow, a tree is falling.""' Freak accident: Centerville, Iowa police officer Jeremy Veach had a brush with death during a routine traffic stop Wednesday when a 30-foot oak fell on top of him out of nowhere. Here, Veach can be seen just before the tree toppled after pulling the car over for driving without headlights . 'I heard a couple cracks, a very loud pop. In hindsight, I had time to think, ""Holy cow, a tree is falling,""' said Veach, who's seen here hitting the pavement to get out of the tree's crashing path and then, at right, as the tree is right on top of him . 'Fortunately for me and unfortunately for the owner of the vehicle, it absorbed a good portion of the impact,' said Veach . The shocking footage released by the Centerville PD and posted to YouTube by the Daily Iowegian shows precisely how close a call it was. 'It’s a wonder he’s not dead,' Veach's Chief of Police Tom Demry told the Iowegian. Veach had only just pulled over the vehicle for driving without headlights when accident occurred. Footage shows the tree come out of nowhere in winds that hovered around just 10MPH and completely shatter. An area resident said the tree showed no signs of disease. 'I was picking tree bark out of my ears, out of my hair. I mean it just exploded tree crumbs everywhere,' Veach said. Shaking it off: Veach appears confused in the moments after the tree fell as he calls for help . Here Veach stands beside what's left of the oak that nearly did him in. It was cut down completely shortly after the incident . While the officer managed to escape with his life intact and only what appeared to be a slight limp, the vehicle he stopped was not as lucky. 'Fortunately for me and unfortunately for the owner of the vehicle, it absorbed a good portion of the impact,' he said. The car was totaled, reports KFOR, but Veach didn't wind up giving the driver a ticket after he climbed to his feet with a little help from a passerby. 'That’s the one true way to get out of a ticket,' joked the officer. 'You know, everyone asks police officers how you get out of a ticket. If a tree falls on you, you’re probably going to get off.'

"By . Adam Duggan . There are fresh calls to raise Australia’s drinking age from 18 to 21, with the rate of alcohol-fuelled violence increasing among young Australians. The Medical Journal of Australia report claims that young people who engage in binge drinking during early adult years are putting themselves at a greater risk of alcohol-induced brain impairment. Authored by four academics from leading Australian universities, the report cites new evidence that increasing the legal purchasing age of alcohol will reduce instances of youth alcohol-related harm. Cause for concern: The Medical Journal of Australia have released a new report calling for the legal drinking age to be raised to 21 . Citing an increase in alcohol-attributed hospitalisations and the normalisation of binge drinking among Australian youth, the group are calling for the prioritisation of prevention. Analysing evidence gathered between 1970 and 1975, when the legal drinking age was dropped to 18 in Canada and several Australian states, the report claims that car crashes involving 18 to 20-year-old drivers increased by 10 per cent. In some cases, the trickle-down effect also meant higher instances of alcohol-related car crashes among 15 to 17 year olds. Evidence relating to the trickle-down effect shows that people aged a few years below the legal drinking age can easily obtain alcohol from older siblings or friends. Angling for action: The increase in alcohol-attributed hospitalisations are a key concern for the four Australian researchers calling for the legal drinking age increase . Meanwhile, the positive impact of a drinking age hike can be seen in data that came out of the US when the drinking age was raised across all states. In 1984, the US government passed legislation to raise the drinking age federally by withholding highway funding to states that would not raise the drinking age to 21. Once the drinking age was raised, evidence from 17 states found an average reduction of underage crash involvement of 16 per cent. 260 youths aged 17-19 surveyed . Similarly, the flow-on effect of the rise meant less people were drinking in adolescence and consequently, developed less harmful drinking patterns as adults. The report cites a 2010 Schoolies experience questionnaire of youth aged 17 to 19 as evidence of the normalisation of binge drinking culture. Acknowledging that their hard-line approach may not go down too well with politicians and alcohol companies in Australia, the researchers also propose alternative policy options. Less challenging options include increasing the drinking age to 19 or 20 years old, so as to remove the legal purchasing of alcohol from high school students. Another option proposed is limiting the types and amount of alcohol that can be purchased by young people, as in Norway or Sweden.","Binge drinking teenagers putting themselves at risk of brain impairment .

But . one young creative has pushed them to a whole new level. Cutting-edge artist Millie Brown, who shot to fame as the girl who drank coloured milk and regurgitated it over Lady Gaga on stage, has embarked on her most challenging work to date. Wilting Point, as her work is called, sees the British performance artist enclosed in Hatbox, a gallery space at Refinery Hotel in New York, removed from the outside world for 168 continuous hours. Scroll down for video . A work of art: Millie Brown's latest performance sees her enclosed in  a gallery space removed from the outside world for 168 continuous hours surviving on only water . Surrounded by a carpet of freshly-cut flowers, Brown is currently lying in complete isolation immersing herself in a meditative state and surviving solely on water for the entire seven days. Speaking about the challenge, which began on Friday and forms part of NYC's Frieze Art week, the 27-year-old said: 'I wanted to create a performance that embodied the transience of life. 'I wanted to eliminate all the distractions from my daily reality in order to focus on the impermanence and fragile beauty of our existence.' Withstanding the physical discomfort and inevitably entering into an altered mental state, Brown will apparently use this fast to 'enable herself to explore the depths the mind can reach, once physical comforts and limitations have been removed'. Finding fame: Millie shot to fame when she drank coloured milk and regurgitated it over Lady Gaga in her music video, Exorcist Interlude . Her toughest challenge yet: Surrounded by a carpet of freshly-cut flowers, Brown wants to immerse herself in a meditative state . The public are being encouraged to follow the evolution of Brown's performance both in person, where she can be glimpsed from the sidewalk through the window of Refinery Hotel's Hatbox, and via VMAGAZINE.COM, where the performance is being live-streamed 24 hours a day. Speaking to the magazine about the inspiration behind her performance, she said: 'I always strive to push through my own physical and mental barriers. I think it’s important to experience everything you can, on every end of the spectrum. 'I believe it’s important to make yourself uncomfortable and learn to separate mind and body in order to reach a raw, primal state of being.' A spokesman B-eat (Beating Eating Disorders) said: 'The artist here is making a choice. Purging is often an extremely secretive behaviour, something that an individual will do anything to hide from others and there certainly are negative health impacts related to purging in this way.'

But despite the regular . retching, Millie insists it doesn’t affect her health. She said she . maintains a healthy vegan lifestyle and always leaves a one month rest . period between each performance. The vomiting visionary . began experimenting with her unique style back in 2005 and has since . gained commercial success by regurgitating onto the dress of pop singer, . Lady Gaga, in a controversial music video. Millie can be seen vomiting shimmering turquoise liquid over the . singer in Lary Gaga's pop music video, Exorcist Interlude, and starred on stage with her. However, Katy Perry isn't a fan. As she kicked off her tour in Northern . Ireland, fans were treated to a video montage of her sticking her finger . in her mouth and spitting up blue and green paint, in what could be . perceived as a mocking nod to Gaga's infamous vomiting performance at . SXSW. The video showed Katy vomiting the paint over herself and the walls. It was similar to Gaga's performance with Millie at the Doritos Bold Stage at Stubb's BBQ earlier this year. Born in England to Bohemian parents . and spending much of her youth in Spain and the South of France, it is . clear where Millie’s maverick tendencies originated. Aged 13 and unable to relate the French children of her neighborhood, Millie befriended local street punks.

Out of this world: NASA astronaut Rick Mastracchio delivered a commencement speech from inside the International Space Station . 'I was trying to figure out how to make this speech different than all the other commencement addresses that are given each year,' Mastracchio said in the video. 'And then I realized: I'm in a weightless environment, so maybe I should give this speech in a different orientation,' he said before making a flip. 'I probably have the best job on and off the planet,' he later said. Mastracchio said he was inspired to become an astronaut after the Challenger disaster in 1986 - and got the job in 1996 after nine years of applications and three interviews. He said the during the interim, he worked as a developer at the Johnson Space Center, completed a second master's degree, and even earned his pilot's license. Flipping out: At the end of his speech Mastracchio even flipped upside down while wearing a UConn hat and cheering 'Go Huskies!' Mastracchio then told the Class of 2014 that in order to become an astronaut or achieve other types of big goals, it requires near-daily hard work and perseverance. Mastracchio also took time in his speech to tell the graduating students' families and friends to be 'impressed' with their accomplishments. After congratulating the Connecticut students on their hard work, Mastracchio showed school pride when he put on a UConn baseball cap and said 'Go Huskies!' as he did another flip, referencing the school's athletic teams.","NASA astronaut Rick Mastracchio delivered a pre-recorded address for students graduating from the University of Connecticut's School of Engineering .

"By . Sam Webb . Whitney Berridge, 15, died last month from a drugs overdose. It is believed she was struggling to cope with the aftermath of her mother's death two years ago . A 15-year-old schoolgirl is thought to have committed suicide because she was unable to live without her mother who was found hanged at her home two years ago. Toxicology tests show that Whitney Berridge, from Basingstoke, Hampshire, died from a drugs overdose. She became ill during a birthday party for another   child at her home on April 19 and died later in North Hampshire Hospital. She suffered from Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, a condition that can cause the   heart to beat abnormally fast. Whitney's death - which is not being treated as suspicious by the police - came nearly two years after her mother Shanie was found hanged on May 6,   2012, at her home in the Popley area of the town. Yesterday her distraught grandmother Mary Gibbons, 55 - who agreed to the heart-breaking decision to switch off her life support machine - said: 'We knew she was unhappy and thinking of her mum all the time.' When asked if Whitney took the overdose because she could not live without her mother, Ms Gibbons added: 'I think it was - I think so. She found it difficult (without her mother). We knew she was unhappy. 'I am not sure (if she could not accept why her mum did it.) She did not get over it. It was near enough two years to the day.' She said Whitney was a 'bubbly, happy girl' who had been 'close to her mum'.  She added: 'They worked on her for four hours but they were fighting a losing battle.' Hundreds of people gathered in Basingstoke's War Memorial Park on Monday April 28 to remember the teenager on what would have been her 16th birthday. They let off pink balloons, as it was her favourite colour . Flowers wre laid at the base of a tree to commemorate the popular teenager . Whitney had been staying with her aunt Leigh Ann O'Leary since her mother's death.  Ms O'Leary, 27, told the Basingstoke Gazette the death of Whitney's mother hit the teenager hard and she had been trying to get counselling for her. 'Whitney and her mum were very close,' she said. 'It was the relationship you always want with your mum. When Shanie died, Whitney died with her.' She added that Whitney had initially been in a good mood on the day she died but her demeanour changed after she received a text message. - Whitney's aunt Leigh Ann O'Leary . Ms O'Leary went upstairs to see if she was OK and the teenager said she was fine. Later on she discovered her niece face down on the floor.  She said: 'I called her three times. I tapped her arm and she didn't answer.' Whitney had been preparing to sit her GSCE exams at the Everest Community Academy and she was expected to achieve good grades. A statement from the academy described Whitney as 'an extremely popular student with both staff and students'. It added: 'She loved to sing and her bright, bubbly personality will be sorely missed.' An inquest at Basingstoke into Whitney's death was told toxicology tests showed she died from a drugs overdose. North East Hampshire Coroner Andrew Bradley adjourned the inquest until July. Hundreds of people gathered in Basingstoke's War Memorial Park on Monday April 28 to remember the teenager on what would have been her 16th birthday.

"By . Hugo Gye . A barmaid says she is so scared of her wardrobe that she has to turn it away from her bed in case something jumps out. Kirstie Hughes, 20, can't even face looking at wardrobes in shops after being traumatised in childhood by a terrifying horror film. She now refuses to watch even beloved children's films such as The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Monsters Inc. and E.T., because they all feature wardrobes. Fear: Kirstie Hughes is terrified of wardrobes after watching a horror film as a child . The phobia first arose when she was 10 years old, and it was not until last year that she summoned up the courage to buy a wardrobe herself. 'There was a scene in a film I watched and a boy was dragged into a wardrobe and ever since I have been scared of them,' Miss Hughes said. 'Old wardrobes like the one in Narnia are my biggest fear, they just look really creepy. 'I have to walk straight past the wardrobe aisle in big furniture stores.' After she bought her first wardrobe, Miss Hughes, from Merseyside, painted it white so it would 'look less scary'. And she keeps it facing away from her bed because of her irrational fear that something might jump out. Caution: Miss Hughes checking inside her wardrobe to make sure there is no danger . 'I use drawers as much as I can to avoid using them and I have to have my bed facing away so I don't have to look at them,' she said. A few months ago, she thought her worst nightmare was coming true when she heard scratches from the inside of a wardrobe at her boyfriend's house. 'I was staying at my boyfriend's house and I didn't know but his cat had got into his wardrobe,' she said. 'I could hear scratching coming from inside it and I just froze up and couldn't move. 'It took me a while to go back in his room because I was that freaked out, it was horrible. 'My friends and family just laugh at me and think it's a bit strange - nobody takes it seriously, they think it's a joke, but I do genuinely have a phobia of wardrobes.' Avoid: Miss Hughes refuses to watch films such as Monsters Inc. (left) and The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (right) She added: 'Even though I am still terrified of wardrobes I've had to force myself to get one because I was literally going through three sets of drawers a year due to breaking them because I have that much stuff. 'It was my boyfriend who got me them because I couldn't bear to go shopping to look for some. I only agreed to have a wardrobe if it was painted white so they looked less scary. 'It still terrifies me now if I hear a bang or a strange noise I automatically think it's coming from the wardrobe.' Phobia of wardrobes is so rare that it does not even have a scientific name. Psychiatrists say that while the most common fears are claustrophobia, agoraphobia and fear of flying, it is possible to become scared of anything. The usual treatment for a debilitating phobia is behavioural therapy, which aims to reduce the patient's anxiety by helping them get accustomed to the thing they are scared of. In the most extreme cases, patients can be prescribed anti-depressants to help them deal with their fears. Kirstie Hughes is not the only person whose life has been affected by an unusual fear of an everyday phenomenon. Last month, shop assistant Mike Amess admitted that he had a crippling phobia of reality star Kim Kardashian. He said that his condition started after he watched her notorious sex tape as a teenager in an attempt to stop himself being gay. Melissa North, a 22-year-old student, has a phobia of cheese, and breaks out in a cold sweat when she gets too close to it. Problems: Mike Amess, left, and Faith Watson, right, also struggle with upsetting phobias . She says she finds it difficult to go to the supermarket, because she is desperate to avoid the cheese counter. Faith Watson, from Suffolk, has a problem which is even closer to home - her fear of loud noises means she can't stand hearing her boyfriend eat. After receiving an official diagnosis of misophonia, she is now rebuilding her life and launching a career as a model. Jo Collins, who works in a bar, is frightened of the music of Elvis Presley, which causes problems when well-meaning punters put him on the jukebox. And mother Lindsay Broom is worried that her daughter will become a lover of the Muppets, as she has a phobia of all puppets and refuses to have them in the house.","Kirstie Hughes watched a horror film featuring a wardrobe as a child .

"By . Mark Duell . The Crown Prosecution Service was today accused of ‘making a fool of the courts’ after the trial of four teenagers was abandoned because of an email blunder. Toby Roberts, 18, Christopher Wicks, 19, Malik Aljerrari, 19, and Sofyan Aljerrari, 18, were due to stand trial at Bournemouth Magistrates’ Court in Dorset over an alleged theft of a pair of sunglasses. While the prosecution spent four months building its case, the alleged victim found his sunglasses and it turned out that they had simply been lost rather than stolen. Hearing: At Bournemouth Magistrates' Court (file picture) in Dorset, furious magistrate Martin Simms blasted the Crown Prosecution Service for the blunder and said the case being brought to court was 'unacceptable' The police updated the CPS via email but due to a ‘human error’ no-one saw the message and the prosecution continued for three more months at an estimated cost of £5,000. The four defendants had no idea of the misunderstanding and appeared for trial as scheduled. It was only then that a CPS solicitor explained that the case should have been dropped in January. Furious magistrate Martin Simms blasted the CPS for the blunder and said the case being brought to court was ‘unacceptable’. Addressing the defendants, he said: ‘You are free to go as there is no case to answer - however, we will make our feelings felt strongly on the records. ‘In the interests of justice we can only apologise for the length of time you have been bouncing backwards and forwards.’ John Reynolds, representing Sofyan Aljerrari, said: ‘This was known a long time ago and nobody bothered to tell the court. In that sense the court has been made a fool of. It is utterly ridiculous.’ Communication breakdown: Dorset Police updated the CPS via email but due to a 'human error' no-one saw the message . Chris Wicks, 40, the father of Christopher Wicks, said the ordeal had left his son ‘distressed’ and described the proceedings as ‘a waste of taxpayers’ money’. He said: ‘The whole thing caused Chris a lot of stress. He was really worried about it. He was supposed to join the Army but couldn’t do because the trial was hanging over him. ‘The whole family were quite distressed. To then find out there was no evidence against him and that the Crown Prosecution Service had known that for months is unbelievable. ‘It’s a total waste of everyone’s time - let alone thousands of pounds of taxpayers’ money.’ Mr Roberts, of Poole, Mr Wicks, of Bournemouth, and the Aljerarri brothers, of Bolton, Lancashire, were arrested on September 30 after they were allegedly seen breaking into cars in Poole. They were found with a pair of sunglasses matching those missing from one of the cars. Attending a preliminary hearing at Bournemouth Magistrates’ Court in December, they denied the charges. The following month the alleged victim, who lives in Spain, changed his statement after finding his sunglasses. But the blunder wasn’t revealed until the . defendants returned for a two-day trial on April 28. A CPS spokesman . blamed the mistake on ‘human error’. She said: ‘On January 31, Dorset Police . received the information from the alleged victim that he was in fact in . possession of his glasses, which were identical to the ones found on the . suspect and that he wished to change his statement. 'The whole thing caused Chris a lot of stress. He was really worried about it. He was supposed to join the Army but couldn’t do because the trial was hanging over him' Chris Wicks, 40, father of Christopher Wicks . ‘The police communicated to us this information via email and due to a human error this was not immediately picked up until the file was reviewed in preparation for the trial on April 16. ‘We immediately emailed the police of our intention to discontinue the case once we were no longer satisfied that there was still sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction. ‘We then requested the police to provide us a statement from the alleged victim confirming that he had found his glasses. ‘The statement was only provided to us on April 25 and as a result we offered no evidence. ‘We fully recognise that this case should have been reviewed once we received the information from the police at the end of January, we are now looking at our process to ensure that this error does not happen in the future.’","Four teenagers were due to stand trial at Bournemouth Magistrates' Court .

"By . Leon Watson . More than half the stores that featured on the BBC's Mary Queen of Shops show have closed, it was revealed today. In the programme, screened on BBC2, 53-year-old retail expert Mary Portas tried to turn around ailing small businesses. But an investigation has found that nine of the 16 featured have shut. Scroll down for video . Makeover: Juliet and Chris Porter (left and right) with Mary Portas (centre) during a 2010 episode of Mary Queen of Shops. Their shop is the latest to close . The Sun on Sunday reported that some shops were sold while others have been replaced in the High Street by giants such as Tesco. The latest casualty was bankrupt general store Clealls of Corfe, which opened in Wareham, Dorset, in 1881. The owners Chris and Juliet Porter, who also lived there, were forced to shut it this year after financial collapse. She encouraged the couple to sell . high-quality local produce and put on a successful tasting event at the . store, with Mr and Mrs Porter handing out meat snacks and wine to . customers. However, last month Mr Porter questioned whether Ms Portas understood their customers' likes and dislikes. He said: 'We were in trouble when Mary got here and it never really picked up when she left. 'Mary didn't make herself popular in the village. She has some good ideas but she thinks everyone comes from Hampstead Heath. Closed: Clealls of Corfe shut this year after the owners went bankrupt . &lt;br/&gt; . 'She wants to have everyone sat there drinking lattes with top quality stock. We kept on telling her, we had a different customer base. 'We might have a few really rich people, or DFLs - down from Londons - as she called them, but then we had rural workers on £9,000 a year. 'Many people can't afford that. It's nice getting locally produced meat but you go to a supermarket and get a chicken for two quid or come here and get a breast of chicken for nine quid."" He continued: 'When she left, we certainly didn't have enough choice and the locals would say that - ""you used to sell this"", ""you used to sell that"".' The couple are living in temporary council accommodation, having sold their London home to buy the shop seven years ago. Mr Porter said: 'In the end we lost everything, we were made homeless and lost our jobs.' Tasting event: Juliet Porter (right) hands out lamb snacks to a customer as Mary Portas (centre) looks on . New start: Chris Porter (centre) offers a Clealls customer some locally produced pork during Mary Queen of Shops . Shut down: The general store's website now carries a message that it is no longer in business . The couple also claimed that Portas's revamp of Clealls was cheaply done and not fit for purpose. Mr Porter explained: 'The original refit they've done on the shop was disgraceful, they used metal shelving that bent when you put three bottles of wine on it. 'When they wanted to do the follow up a few weeks later to show how things are going, I told them if they didn't come and fix the shop I would go to ITV to see if they would do a makeover show on the mess up. 'You couldn't run a business the way they'd left it. They sent down some carpenters who put some new shelves up for us - they didn't mention that on the show.' Mrs Porter, 47, added: 'It was on the premise that it was going to change our businesses. What they promised and what we got were very different. 'They ran out of finances on day two and were looking for builders in the village to help white wash the shop.' Mr Porter said: 'They don't want to spend any money on you. They used doors as shelves - its then quite easy to get someone trendy to say ""that's the new trendy look"". 'It's about Mary shouting at you. That's what people want, to come in and say how bad everything is to start with and then at the end get a smile out of you and say ""look what I've done"".' But they also point to competition from Tesco and bad weather over essential summer months as reasons for their business going bust. In summer 2011, tourists were put off by weeks of rain and the following year, Tesco began delivering to the area's campsites. Mr Porter said: 'There are 10 major campsites around the village and they all signed up to have Tesco deliver to your tent. 'That had a major impact - our business relied on the campsite. During the summer we would see the campsite people every day, maybe twice a day. 'They would come in the morning before going to the beach and come in on the way back.' Ms Portas pointed out that there are many factors that affect a shop's success. She told MailOnline: ‘This was a shop [Clealls of Corfe] that was losing £6,000 a week when I went in to help. 'I'm so sad to see it close, but over four years all kinds of factors affect sales and it's a case of constantly trying to adapt to survive on today's high street.' Her spokesman, David Wood, added that were it not for Ms Portas's help, the shop might have closed even earlier. He said: 'Losing £6,000 a week would drive any business under ground in minutes, but they kept going for another four years, so something must have worked. 'We don't give people on the show rules, it's just advice - and they could have done something else in the four years since they met Mary.' The BBC declined to comment.","Investigation finds that nine of the 16 featured on the show have shut .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Sacked: David Lowe, who has 32 years' service with the BBC, lost his job for playing The Sun Has Got His Hat On . The sacking of a veteran BBC DJ for accidentally playing a song featuring the N-word has been condemned as ‘unfair’ by David Cameron and Boris Johnson. The senior Tories leapt to the defence of David Lowe for his treatment after broadcasting a 1930s recording of The Sun Has Got His Hat On. Prime Minister Mr Cameron said the case ‘looked a bit odd’ while Mr Johnson said the Corporation’s treatment of the broadcaster was ‘utterly disgraceful’. Critics have compared the decision to oust Mr Lowe to the treatment of Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson using the N-word in a leaked clip from the show. Mr Lowe lost his job after he played a recording of the song by Ambrose & His Orchestra on his Sunday night show on Radio Devon. The version includes the line: ‘He’s been tanning n****** out in Timbuktu, now he’s coming to do the same to you.’ It is understood that only one person complained and that Mr Lowe, who was unaware the word was in the lyrics, planned to apologise to listeners on his next programme. However he was prevented from doing so by bosses who asked him to ‘fall on his sword’. Today Mr Cameron joined the chorus of disapproval aimed at the the way Mr Lowe had been treated. He told ITV’s Good Morning Britain: ‘The word in question is awful and unacceptable and people shouldn't use it. ‘I don't run the BBC so I have to be careful but it does seem in this case where if he really didn't know what was on the record, it does seem slightly unfair. ‘And as I understand it the BBC have talked about taking him back on again... Well as I say, I don't know all the facts of the case but from reading the papers like everyone else, it looked a bit odd,’ the Prime Minister said. Prime Minister David Cameron said the treatment of Mr Lowe was 'unfair' while London Mayor Boris Johnson said it was 'utterly disgraceful' Innocent: Mr Lowe played a 1932 version of the son, performed by Amrbose & His Orchestra, on a Sunday night golden oldies show . Meanwhile London Mayor Mr Johnson said Britain was living in a ‘Boko Haram world’, in reference to the terrorist network that kidnapped over 200 schoolgirls in Nigeria. Boko Haram forbids Muslims to take part in any political or social activity connected to Western society and has killed more than 1,500 people this year. In his Daily Telegraph column, Mr Johnson wrote: ‘In our own modest way, we live in a Boko Haram world, where it all depends on the swirling rage of the internet mob, and where terrified bureaucrats and politicians are borne along on a torrent of confected outrage. ‘There is no consistency in the outlook of the Nigerian maniacs: they use weapons produced by the very capitalist system they claim to deplore, for instance. ‘There is certainly no logic at the BBC. They should restore Mr Lowe to his job - if he will take it - and the entire BBC board should go down to Devon to apologise in person, and at their own expense.’ Jeremy Clarkson, shown filming for Top Gear, when it is alleged he used the n-word but kept his job . He added: ‘Their treatment of this man is utterly disgraceful.’ The BBC has offered him his job back, but Mr Lowe said he declined because his departure caused him so much stress and flared up a medical condition he suffers from. A BBC spokeswoman said the corporation admitted the discussion about Mr Lowe's future ‘could have been handled better’ and said the ‘door remained open’ should he want to return.","David Lowe, 67, lost his job after he played a recording of the song .

"By . Wills Robinson . The highest paid Legal Aid barrister in Britain raked in nearly £700,000 of taxpayers’ money last year even though many lawyers refused to work because of a drop in fees. John Rees QC earned a staggering £675,798 and is one of four barristers who received more than £500,000 in 2013, despite protests over a £2billion cut in public-funded legal aid which has caused many barristers to shy away from complex cases. He specialises in fraud, has represented a number of alleged murderers and child abusers and is one of 20 lawyers who shared fees of nearly £8.5 million representing defendants. Protests: Twenty of the country's top lawyers shared £8.5million in taxpayer-funded fees, despite many barristers refusing to work because of a cut in their fees . The . government proposals have sparked angry protests by members of the legal profession and has led to the collapse of a high-profile fraud . case. Among the top . earners was Lewis Power QC, who recently represented traveller Tommy . Connors who was convicted of keeping vulnerable men captive and forcing . them to work. Connors, 53, . was jailed for eight years, and his son Patrick, 21, for five, at Luton . Crown Court last May, after being convicted of servitude, compulsory . labour and assault charges. The . pair, from Bedfordshire, deliberately targeted men on the streets or in . soup kitchens and promised them food and lodgings, but subjected them . to shocking abuse. Mr Power QC, who represented Connors Sr, received £372,664 from legal aid during 2012/13. Nigel Power QC earned £399,925 for his work defending a number of high-profile cases. One of his recent clients was . Christopher Curran, who was cleared of the murder of pensioner Glynis . Solmaz, who was choked to death while he burgled her home. Curran . admitted conspiring with three others to burgle Ms Solmaz's home in . Wrexham, North Wales, last February, to steal £40,000 cash. Mr Power . represented Curran who was jailed for four years at Mold Crown Court in . November, while one of his accomplices, Alexandros Wetherill, was . convicted of murder. Anger: The £2billion cut in legal aid has seen the fees lawyers have paid for some cases slashed by up to 30 per cent. But many are still receiving huge taxpayer-funded payouts . John Rees QC earned nearly £700,000 in taxpayer-funded legal aid last year . John Rees QC is based in Cardiff, and was the highest-paid Legal Aid barrister in Britain last year, raking in £675,798 . He specialises in serious crime and has worked on a number of high-profile fraud cases, which normally garner the highest legal aid fees. He was educated at Jesus College in Cambridge and received a 'Blue' in boxing. In 2011, he represented Cardiff City player Craig Bellamy after he was arrested for assault. The Welsh striker was found not guilty. He has also defended solicitors who have been accused of defrauding the legal aid system or private clients. A section called 'quotations' includes . one from an unknown client saying: 'If he murdered his wife, John would . be his first port of call.' Another says: 'His commitment, dedication, painstaking preparation and mastery of detail make him second to none in complex, serious fraud cases.' Earlier in the month the trial of five defendants accused of a land bank fraud collapsed because barristers could not be found to defend the complex case at Southwark Crown Court, on the lower rate. Last night Nigel Lithman, chairman of the Criminal Bar Association, accused the Ministry of Justice of producing misleading figures to portray the profession as ‘universally wealthy’. He said: ‘The earnings of 20 people continue to be published in a misleading way, namely including 20 per cent VAT, whilst excluding the substantial expenses that attach to the Bar and ignoring the fact that these fees may well reflect two or even three years' work. These figures continue to be published in a way that applies to no other professions. ‘The purpose can only be to portray the profession as universally wealthy, whereas the Government recognises that an average take-home pay is in accord with the national average and is below £28,000 per annum.’ The Ministry of Justice said: ‘We have one of the most expensive legal aid systems in the world and these kind of costs are exactly why we had to make changes. ‘We have reduced the cost of a small number of the longest running criminal cases by 30 per cent - just one of these cases recently cost more than £8 million in legal aid. ‘We want to ensure the limited money we have for legal aid is concentrated on those cases and people who need it most.’","John Rees QC, who has defended high-profile fraud cases, raked in £675,798 .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . The popularity of Labour policies is being undermined by the fact just a quarter of voters think Ed Miliband is up to the job of being Prime Minister, a damning new poll reveals. His plans to freeze energy bills, take on private landlords and consider renationalising the railways are backed by more than 60 per cent of people. But in a fresh sign of the Labour leader’s image problem, just 14 per cent think he is a strong leader and many remain wary of handing the keys to Number 10. The latest YouGov opinion poll shows how voters back many of Labour's flagship policies . Fewer than a quarter of voters think Mr Miliband is up to the job of being Prime Minister . Mr Miliband will use a major speech tonight on health in an attempt cut through on a key issue to voters. But a new analysis by pollsters YouGov reveals that while his policies are popular with the majority of voters, Mr Miliband fails to impress. The flagship promise to freeze gas and electricity bills for two years was unveiled by Mr Miliband at last year’s Labour conference. It is supported by 69 per cent of voters, with 17 per cent opposed – a huge margin, according to a YouGov poll. A recently-announced Labour plan aimed at the so-called Generation Rent to take on landlords is also popular. Some 63 per cent of people back the idea of making standard tenancies last for three years and limiting the amount by which landlords can put up rents, only 19 per cent are against. Taking on . the railways is also popular. Mr Miliband has hinted that he is in . favour of the state running more lines in the UK, a move backed by many . of his MPs and the unions. Sixty per cent of those surveyed back renationalising the railways, with just 20 per cent opposed. Last week Mr Miliband promised a crack down on ‘ghost homes’ bought up by wealthy investors which then stand empty. Labour would impose council tax premiums for properties which stand empty, an idea supported by 54 per cent of people. However, none of this backing policy-by-policy is reflected in support for Mr Miliband. Mr Miliband's boast that he more intellectually confident than Mr Cameron was rejected by voters . Only 14 per cent think he is a strong leader. Just 26 per cent think he makes it clear what he stands for and only 23 per cent say he is up to the job of Prime Minister. The Labour lead in the headline polls also remains at between one and seven per cent. YouGov’s Peter Kellner said: ‘Given the popularity of Miliband’s recent proposals, and the publicity he has gained for them, he and his party ought to be gaining ground. They are not. ‘Miliband has so far failed to convert enthusiasm for his policies into support for his leadership.’ Mr Miliband is said to be losing the battle on ‘valence’ issues identified by political scientists, including competence, honesty and strength of character. ‘Parties and their leaders can announce the world’s most popular policies; they will still lose if voters think they aren’t up to the job of governing Britain, or won’t keep their word, or will duck tough choices,’ Mr Kellner added. In an interview last week Mr Miliband boasted of having more intellectual confidence than David Cameron. The claim risked backfiring because he actually got a worse degree than Mr Cameron. In fact, 50 per cent of people think Mr Cameron is more intellectually confident, while just 22 per cent said the same of Mr Miliband.","New poll reveals problems with the leader could be holding Labour back .

"By . Lucy Crossley . For many they are a key part of the World Cup build up, but it has been claimed pupils have been banned from swapping Panini football stickers in their school playground because 'it's annoying for teachers'. The collectables, featuring stars such as Christiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, and Neymar, have reportedly been blamed for a number of playground bustups between young football fans. It has been claimed that teachers at Battyeford . Primary School in Mirfield, West Yorkshire, became so fed up as their . pupils' desire for the stickers reached fever pitch that they have . banned them from the playground. Craze: Pupils have been banned from swapping Panini football stickers in their school playground because 'it's annoying for teachers', it is claimed . 'Pupils were getting into fights and teachers were getting annoyed,' childminder Lisa Davies-Unger, 47, who looks after children at the school, told The Sun. 'It's a distraction so I suppose that led to the ban.' However, a spokesman at the school said children had not been banned from . bringing the stickers to school, and were even encouraged to swap the . stickers as part of a school club. 'There is no ban on children bringing stickers into school,' he said. 'Children are welcome to bring in their stickers and they are doing so with the blessing of staff. We even have a special club where children can get together and swap them in their free time.' Panini, which has the exclusive rights . from FIFA to produce and sell the tournament's official sticker album . expects this year's edition to be the most popular yet, with billions . sold before and during this year's competition. Rules: Teachers at Battyeford Primary School in Mirfield, West Yorkshire, deny children have been banned from bringing stickers to school . Collection: Panini, which has the exclusive rights from FIFA to produce and sell World Cup official sticker albums expects this year's edition to be the most popular yet . Already 40million of the packets, which sell for around 50p, have been bought - and no doubt swapped - worldwide. And last week it was reported that a teacher in the Columbian city of Bucaramanga had been accused of confiscating stickers from pupils, and using them to complete his own Panini album. According to local media a 13-year-old boy reported seeing the teacher in the staff room filling his album with the stickers taken from children. Last month Panini had to reassure fans in Brazil that there would not be a shortage of stickers after thieves hijacked a van containing 300,000 of them. Football stickers are popular around the globe . Collectible football cards and stickers have been swapped by young football fans since the late 1880s when they were frequently found inside cigarette packets. Italian company Panini started selling packets of football stickers in the 1960s and in 1970 produced its first World Cup album to tie in with that year's tournament in Mexico - selling the stickers outside of Italy for the first time. Football stickers took off in the UK in 1978, when the World Cup was being held in Argentina. A 1980s market research survey revealed that more than 90 percent of boys aged between nine and 11 had bought at least one packet of football stickers. And by the 1990s collecting stickers was a full blown phenomenon, with girls and boys alike eagerly trading 'shinys' as they tried to complete the set. In 1994 multiple re-prints were needed for sticker company Merlin's first official Premier League collection, such was the demand. Last November, 29-year-old Portsmouth . fan and comedy writer Adam Carroll-Smith made headlines when he tracked . down the six players whose faces were missing from his 1996 Merlin . Premier League Album. It . took him six months to trace Keith Curle, Stuart Ripley, Scott Minto, . Gary Penrice, Philippe Albert and Lars Bohinen, visit them and take . their pictures to fill in the gaps in his album, documenting his efforts . in his book Six Stickers: A Journey To Complete An Old Sticker Album. Every year Panini prints more than a billion stickers, and as well as football stickers also print ranges featuring cartoon characters such as Peppa Pig and bands including One Direction. In the 2013/14 season Topps, which has owned the rights to Merlin since 1995, celebrated the 20th anniversary of the official Premier League Sticker collection. Topps also produces Match Attax, a trading card game which also features Premier League stars.","Claims collectible World Cup stickers have been behind playground fights .

"By . Darren Boyle . It was a time of great change as Britain had finally shed its post-war austerity and looked forward with a new confidence and prosperity. These photographs, taken around London in 1964, show a city and a country undergoing a dramatic transformation. The year was one of major upheaval in British history. National Service had been abolished in 1960 but the final troops involved on their compulsory military tour of duty were not sent home until the end of December 1963. Unlike their fathers and grandfathers, teenagers in 1964 were not facing the prospect of a European war and increasing living standards allowed them a disposable income. A Notting Hill party in 1964, around the time the first carnival took place, drawing a crowd of just 500 people. The year saw momentous changes in British culture, as these pictures demonstrate . A couple's happy day captured in Brixton, South London, during 1964 with the bride enjoying a glass of wine before cutting the elaborately decorated cake . January 1964 saw the first broadcast of a revolutionary new music show on the BBC, Top of the Pops. It represented the start of a cultural shift with British acts heading across to the United States and topping the charts. For these young people, recently dubbed teenagers, Bob Dylan . described the situation pretty accurately when he sang 'The Times They . Are A-Changin', released in January 1964. In . Britain, the Conservative government of Alec Douglas Home was replaced . by Labour's Harold Wilson, who promised to bring the country into the 'white heat' of the technical revolution, winning with a majority of just four seats. It was the year that the Beatles appeared on the Ed Sullivan show, the Rolling Stones launched their eponymous debut album and the Kinks from Muswell Hill had the hit 'You Really Got Me'. In Brixton, South London, an elderly woman pumps coins into a one-armed bandit in an amusement arcade while smoking a cigarette, oblivious to the photographer standing a few feet away . Social change: A short distance from the amusement arcade a group of people stand in line waiting for a bus . In . London, the culture of the city was changing rapidly, less than a . generation after the first immigrants aboard the Empire Windrush arrived . on Tilbury Docks. Areas . such as Brixton had become very popular with some of the immigrant . communities, while across in Notting Hill, the first August bank-holiday . carnival was held. It now regularly attracts more than two million . visitors to the city but in 1964, just 500 people are thought to have . attended. The new communities brought with them a new culture, music and cuisine, but official moves were being made to restrict the numbers of . people coming from the former colonies with a succession of Commonwealth . Immigration Acts. But as these photographs show, the cultural make up of Britain was changing for ever. These west African women are shopping for fruit and vegetables in a Brixton market stall . Unlike their parents, many children went to school with the sons and daughters of immigrants from the Commonwealth . Among the major developments in 1964, it was the year that Britain finally abolished the death penalty although on August 13, 1964 Gwynne Owen Evans and Peter Anthony Allen were executed for the robbery an murder of John Alan West on April 7, 1964. As plans were being made to abolish the death penalty, Moors Murderers Ian Brady and Myra Hindley were in the middle of their killing spree. Meanwhile, the large number of . immigrants moving to Britain from the Commonwealth caused some concern . and led to a succession of restrictions being imposed, particularly due . to the political instability of some former colonies such as Kenya. Some . politicians feared that without restrictions large numbers of . Commonwealth citizens would move and settle in Britain for a better . life. This picture was taken at Epsom during the Derby in 1964. It was won by Irish horse Santa Claus. It shows a tic-tac man and punter studying the form sheet . One of the most iconic images of the era are the humble NHS glasses now coveted by hipsters in skinny jeans with fixed gear bicycles in Dalton . But it was not just the young children at school who began mixing. The new immigrants brought their own culture with them and opened venues, such this underground club in Cable Street in London's East End . A man in a Brixton barber reads about the 1964 bout between Cassius Clay and Sonny Liston. Mr Clay was soon better known by the name Muhammad Ali . In 1964, young couples looking for a new home could look at the average house for £3,360. At the time the average wage was £18 a year meaning that a house was only three-and-a-half times the annual wage of £960. Interest rates during the period were 5.5 per cent. If the price of a house seemed reasonable, then a loaf of bread was a positive bargain at the cost of just 5p while a football fan would buy a season ticket for about £8.50. The pre-match pint would only cost between 8-10p in 1964. In the cinema, Sergio Leone reinvented the western with A Fistful of Dollars and a brooding Clint Eastwood, while Michael Caine starred in Zulu. Sean Connery returned as James Bond in Goldfinger while Stanley Kubrick mocked the spy thriller genre with Dr Strangelove. Musical fans in 1964 had a few highlights as well with Mary Poppins and My Fair Lady. Some things in London change very little - as shown by these glamorous women shopping in Oxford Street on the hunt for the latest styles . However, in Spitalfields, things seem to have been kept in a time warp with butchers serving traditional cuts in the same manner they have done for more than a century . Internationally, Jack Ruby is sentenced to death for murdering Lee Harvey Oswald, who assassinated US President John F Kennedy. Ruby's conviction is later overturned and he dies before he can be tried a second time. The Warren Commission rules that Oswald acted alone when he murdered the president. The United States was getting more heavily involved in the Vietnam War and in South Africa, Nelson Mandela is sentenced to life in prison for his opposition to the apartheid regime. Malta also declared independence from Britain in 1964. Meanwhile, outside Spitafields, a man who could have been the inspiration for Steptoe and Son pushes his pram along the street while a young girl looks disinterested . At the time when Daihatsu started importing its first cars into the British market, and were greeted with raised eyebrows, but over the next 30 years Japanese cars became a common site on British roads . 1964 was also the year with the Forth Road bridge was completed and considered a major engineering triumph. The British and French government signed an agreement in 1964 that a tunnel should be built between England and France and it should be completed by the end of the decade.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Sponge puddings are enjoying a revival as one of the nation’s favourite desserts after decades of declining sales. Food experts say the surge in popularity is thanks to new varieties with modern flavours such as Swiss chocolate and salt caramel. Demand for sponge puddings, which have been around since the 18th Century, has soared by 60 per cent at Tesco which now sells nearly 10 million a year. A classic sticky toffee and sponge pudding with custard . Pret a Manger last week announced it was selling almost 9,000 pots of porridge a day . Among the new family favourites are Tesco's Swiss chocolate sponge . A Tesco spokesman said: ‘An evolution in flavours means that the sponge pudding has won back the hearts of British shoppers.’ The classic sponge and treacle pud became one of the most popular desserts during the Victorian era. Sales reached their peak in the middle of the 20th Century when they became available in tins.However, the puddings were pushed out of favour by fancier foreign desserts in the 1980s. Last week, Pret a Manger announced that retro-food porridge was it's biggest seller, with almost 9,000 pots being sold every morning. Pret a Manger said its £2.35 ‘porridge pots’ were its bestselling item last year, selling more than 3.2million pots in the UK, equal to around 8,800 every day. With just 243 calories in each 300g pot - compared to 616 calories in its All-Day Breakfast Roll - its porridge is also one of its more slimming options for breakfast. Pret has only been selling porridge since 2010, and its popularity has surged recently. Sales rose by ten per cent last year, compared to 2012, even managing to beat the previous bestseller - bananas - into second place in the 2013 league table of Pret’s most popular foods. Such is its enthusiasm for porridge that it has specially trained ‘porridge chefs’ to make its breakfast bestseller. It is stirred ‘gently but continuously’ until it is cooked to avoid lumps, and must be removed immediately from the heat when it is ready to stop it from becoming too gloopy.","Tesco has seen sales of sponge pudding jump by 60 percent over past year .

"By . Tara Brady . A teenage beauty queen who suffered 25 per cent burns to her face and body after she was seriously injured in a freak explosion has taken to the catwalk to compete in a top beauty contest. Plastic surgeons performed three skin graft operations on Lucy Morgan after a can of flammable liquid blew up in her face on March 9 this year while she sat next to a bonfire with friends. Miss Morgan frantically tried to dampen the fire but by the time a friend had used a blanket to stop the burning she had suffered horrendous burns and her tights had disintegrated. Inspirational: Lucy Morgan at the Miss Leeds beauty contest held in Leeds, West Yorkshire, on Saturday night . Despite the injuries, the 19-year-old became a contestant in the glamorous Miss Leeds contest on Saturday night and made it to the final ten. Miss Morgan did not end up in the final three, but she said just making it to the competition was 'quite an achievement' for her. Wearing a floor length white gown, her right hand and arm covered by a long black glove, the student said she took her inspiration from acid attack victim Katie Piper. Former model and TV presenter Piper suffered horrific facial injuries after an ex-boyfriend arranged to have sulphuric acid thrown in her face. Plastic surgeons performed three skin graft operations on Lucy Morgan after a can of flammable liquid blew up in her face . Since the attack she has established a charity, the Katie Piper Foundation, aimed at raising awareness of the plight of victims of burns and other disfigurement injuries. Miss Morgan, of Harrogate, North Yorkshire, said: 'Katie Piper is my role model, she had her own problems in life but went on to help other people in their lives. 'She is a great inspiration to me.' Despite her injuries, the 19-year-old became a contestant in the glamorous Miss Leeds contest . Achievement: Lucy made the final ten competitors in Saturday night's contest held in the city's Baracoa Luxe Bar . Emotional: Lucy Morgan who earlier this year suffered burns to 25 per cent burns to her face and body . Speaking after the contest, keen horserider Miss Morgan said she wasn't disappointed with her placing. 'Just making it here is a massive personal achievement for me. I hope it shows other people that if you have scars or disability you don't have to hold back in life.' She added that she now wants to set up a charity called the Phoenix Trust to help others. Miss Morgan said: 'The accident happened just a week after I won my place in the event and, sitting in pain in my hospital bed with my anesthetised body covered in bandages, I thought it was an impossible dream to take part. 'My world had been turned upside down in an instant.

"By . Ted Thornhill . A dog owner has told of her frantic battle to save her pet from a 15-foot python that had coiled around it – using a pocket knife. Courtney Link saved her dog, Dexter, from the enormous snake by stabbing it in the head, after punches she’d unleashed on the serpent failed to make it loosen its grip. Mrs Link was walking Dexter with her husband in Hong Kong’s Sai Kung West Country Park last weekend when the terrifying encounter took place. Recovery: Dexter received deep bites from the python . Desperate: A British ex-pat dog walker in Hong Kong has told of her frantic battle with a python after it coiled around her pet dog . Well-exercised: Dexter (left) out on a walk with another dog before the python attack . Saved: Mrs Link found Dexter as a stray puppy, close to death, and said that he means the world to her . Dexter ran out of sight at one point – and a few moments later the pair heard  ‘frantic barking and a strange gurgling noise’, according to The South China Morning Post. To their horror, they found a huge Burmese python coiled around Dexter’s head, neck and body. Mrs Link, a British expatriate, desperately punched the snake repeatedly, but to no avail. Then her husband handed her his pocket knife. Mrs Link, who runs a care service for animals called The Pet Nanny, said: ‘Dexter was starting to weaken and he eventually stopped struggling altogether. At that point we really thought we had lost him. So when I suddenly saw the snake's head, I just started stabbing furiously.’ Dedicated: Mrs Link runs an animal care service . Weapon: Mrs Link used a pocket knife similar to this to fend off the snake, which was coiled around her dog's head, neck and body . This had the desired effect and the reptile slithered away. Dexter, who weighs around three and a half stone, was left in a state of shock and suffered deep bite wounds, but has now made a full recovery and is back to his energetic self, according to Mrs Link. Luckily for Dexter, his owner had recently completed an animal first aid course and put her skills to use in the immediate aftermath of the attack. She told MailOnline: 'Dexter is incredibly special to us as I found him as a stray puppy very sick, emaciated and close to death. 'He is also my first dog, a life long dream to have a canine companion. He has transformed my life and motivated me to become a Canine CPR Emergency Responder in case I needed to save his life one day. I completed this course in the UK in March 2014. So amazingly well timed.' The python is a protected species in Hong Kong and Mrs Link said she only stabbed the one that attacked Dexter as a last resort. Adult Burmese pythons usually grow to around 15 feet in length, with the biggest ever recorded, in Florida, being 18 feet. They favour rats and mice, but will take pigs and goats – and even alligators. Researchers, meanwhile, have discovered something new about Burmese pythons - the snakes are really good at finding their way home. Size matters: University of Florida staff next to the longest Burmese python ever recorded - which measured 18 feet, eight inches . Researchers caught six pythons in South Florida's Everglades National Park, implanted radio transmitters under their skins and released them up to two dozen miles from where they were captured. Surprisingly, the snakes found their way home within months. According to research being published in the journal Biology Letters, the pythons slithered with a purpose instead of moving randomly across the wetlands. It's unclear how the snakes mapped their routes. The discovery about pythons' unusual navigational abilities doesn't immediately help Florida's wildlife agencies trying to curb the python population in Florida wetlands. The tan, splotchy snakes are notoriously hard to spot in the Everglades even when tracked with transmitters.","Dog in Hong Kong park attacked by Burmese python while out on a walk .

"By . Dan Bloom . A cash-strapped council has been criticised for handing a rugby team at least £750 for a weekend jaunt to the south of France. It is thought officials in Cumbernauld, North Lanarkshire, have been offering the £50-a-head subsidy for several years despite savage budget cuts. The biennial tour sees players take a 24-hour bus ride to their twin town of Bron, where they enjoy 'festivities' before a match against Bron's rugby club. Controversial: The money was paid to support the town of Cumberland, North Lanarkshire (file photo) The grants were exposed this week and came despite North Lanarkshire Council axing 700 staff over three years to meet £62million of budget cuts. The total handed to the club is likely to be higher than £750 (one grant per player), as council officials were unable to say what amounts were given out in previous years. Rugby club president Jim Cochrane insisted the cash, which is for travel expenses only, showed the council's commitment to Cumbernauld. But the handouts were criticised by an Scottish National Party councillor and a taxpayers' campaign group. Eben Wilson, of Taxpayer-Scotland, said: 'Rugby clubs are private organisations and should survive or fail on their own efforts. Twin town: The bus trip every two years is to Bron (pictured), near Lyon in the south of France . 'It's not a good idea to start subsidising them, because there is no end to the number of people who might want support. 'Taxpayers want their taxes spent on public services, not private trips.' North Lanarkshire councillor Tommy Cochrane, from the SNP, added: 'We need to find exactly where this money is being sourced from. 'All council spending should be focused locally rather than being taken out of the region. 'If the council is having to make cuts, then we should be very careful where we're spending money.' Cumbernauld RFC began making the 1,000-mile in 1983 and the tours have been a tradition since then. The Scottish and French clubs alternate who hosts the matches, playing an away match in one year and a home match in the next. Picturesque: A country park in Cumbernauld. The council said the cash was to help cover travel expenses . The club's president Jim Cochrane insisted the council's support showed its commitment to the town. 'The council have been supporting us for years,' he said. 'I'll be the first to admit that I was surprised, in these days of cuts, that they were still able to offer the money. 'It is absolutely great of them, and shows that they haven't lost sight of the strong links between two sporting organisations and value what the club are doing in maintaining these links.' A council spokesperson added: 'Cumbernauld has a long standing twinning agreement with Bron and we are proud of the education, business and sporting links. 'Since 1983 annual exchange visits have taken place between the Cumbernauld and Bron Rugby clubs. 'The council is happy to support this and offers £50 to each participant from Cumbernauld to assist with their travelling expenses.'","Officials in Cumbernauld, North Lanarkshire, topped up rugby team's kitty .

"By . David Mercer . Hundreds of dangerous dogs were destroyed last year after being seized by police, new figures have shown. Some of the country’s biggest forces reported a rise in the number of dogs seized under the Dangerous Dogs Act, including banned breeds and those which attacked people and other pets. Animal charities have called for 'drastic changes' to dangerous dog laws ahead of changes set to be enforced on Tuesday, which will make it possible for owners to be prosecuted for dog attacks on private property. Friends arrive to place floral tributes near the scene where 14-year-old Jade Anderson who was savaged to death by four dogs - believed to be two bull mastiffs and two Staffordshire bull terriers . It follows the death of 14-year-old Jade Anderson who was savaged by four dogs - believed to be two bull mastiffs and two Staffordshire bull terriers - as she was visiting the home of a friend near Wigan, Greater Manchester, in March last year. Freedom of Information (FOI) responses obtained by the Press Association from police forces in England, Wales and Scotland found a number of forces recorded a rise in how many dangerous dogs they seized. The country’s second largest force, West Midlands Police, revealed that the number of dogs seized under the Dangerous Dogs Act had risen by 50% compared with 2011. The force seized 412 dogs in 2013, up from 360 in 2012 and 275 in 2011. A total of 181 dangerous dogs were destroyed last year, compared with 159 in 2012 and 138 in 2011, West Midlands Police said. Elsewhere, Lancashire, Avon and Somerset, Surrey, South Wales, North Wales, Warwickshire, Cleveland and Gwent Police all reported a rise in the number of dangerous dogs seized last year. Japanese Tosa is one of the animals banned under the Dangerous Dogs Act along with Fila Brasileiro and Dogo Argentino . However Scotland Yard revealed a fall in the number of dangerous dogs seized last year. Britain’s biggest force said 585 dogs were seized under the Dangerous Dogs Act in 2013 and 95 were destroyed. This compared with 777 dangerous dogs seized and 103 destroyed in 2012, while in 2011, 499 dogs were seized and 110 were destroyed. Greater Manchester Police said it seized 198 dogs under the Dangerous Dogs Act in 2013, compared with 203 in 2012 and 190 in 2011. Sixty dangerous dogs were destroyed in 2013, compared with 66 in 2011 and 85 in 2011, GMP said. Breeds banned under the Dangerous Dogs Act include any pitbull types, Japanese Tosa, Fila Brasileiro and Dogo Argentino. Dogs Trust charity said it had been arguing for 'drastic changes' in dangerous dog laws and claimed other legislation did not go far enough to tackle irresponsible dog owners. A spokeswoman for the charity said: 'We do not consider breed specific legislation to be effective and would like to see it repealed. 'We have become increasingly aware of the issues caused by ‘problem’ dogs or, more accurately, their problem owners. 'We believe that, in many cases, dangerous dogs are a social issue, rather than exclusively a ""dog"" problem. 'Crucially, non-legislative interventions to influence irresponsible owners and better educate the public are needed. 'Dogs Trust is encouraged by the Government’s commitment to improving dog control legislation. However, the charity does not believe that the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act goes far enough in tackling the various problems surrounding irresponsible ownership in the UK. 'There is a clear need for a fundamental overhaul of dog legislation.' An RSPCA spokesman said: 'The RSPCA is opposed to breed specific legislation. As an animal welfare charity we believe the law needs to focus on the actions of the owners at the root of the problem, rather than the types of dog. 'To focus on a specific breed or type of dog is to miss the problem itself. You can only legislate for the actions or inactions of humans (the owners) and not the dog. A spokesman for the Association of Chief Police Officers declined to comment ahead of upcoming changes to dangerous dog legislation.","Greater Manchester Police seized .

"By . Ted Thornhill . Pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine ignored a public call by Russian President Vladimir Putin to postpone a referendum on independence, declaring they would go ahead on May 11 with a vote that could lead to war. Denis Pushilin, a leader of the self-declared separatist Donetsk People's Republic, said on Thursday that the ‘People's Council’ had voted unanimously to hold the plebiscite as planned. ‘Civil war has already begun. The referendum can put a stop to it and start a political process,’ he told reporters. Scroll down for video . Change of heart: Putin, pictured during a wreath laying ceremony at the Kremlin, said that a referendum in eastern Ukraine should be postponed . The announcement coincided with a sharp change of tone from Moscow, which had signalled a pullback from confrontation on Wednesday with Putin's call for the vote to be delayed and a declaration that troops were withdrawing from Ukraine's border. Russian markets sank on the news, and in Kiev, officials promised to press on with their ‘anti-terrorist campaign’ to retake control over the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk regardless of the rebels' decision on the vote. Putin’s remarks have been a ploy to avert further sanctions from the West. It’s possible that he may have publically called for the referendum to be postponed, while privately encouraging it. Gamesmanship: One analyst said Putin would have known that his request for the referendum to be postponed would be rebuffed . Claim: Pro-Russian activist leader Denis Pushilin, who is co-head of the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic, pictured here during a rally in Lenin Square in Donetsk, has said that the referendum will halt a civil war . At the ready: Soldiers from the National Guard of Ukraine fire weapons on a training firing field outside Kiev . Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet Western leaders for the first time since the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis when he attends a World War Two anniversary in France next month, the Russian ambassador to Paris said on Thursday. U.S. President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel are among those due to attend the June 6 ceremony in Normandy to mark the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings that helped turn the tide of the war against Nazi Germany. Ambassador Alexander Orlov confirmed Putin's planned attendance in comments to BFM television, after France's president and defence minister both said the Russian leader - accused by the West of destabilising neighbouring Ukraine - was still welcome to come. 'I have told Vladimir Putin, as representative of the Russian people, that he is welcome to attend the ceremony,' President Francois Hollande said. Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian went further, saying that cancelling Putin's invitation would be a historical insult. 'It is in the order of things that (Putin) should be there,' he told BFM. Moscow's relations with the West have worsened dramatically since Ukrainians toppled their pro-Russian president in February and Russia responded by annexing Ukraine's Crimean peninsula and massing troops on the country's eastern border. The United States and European Union have imposed sanctions on dozens of Russians, and leaders of the Group of Seven leading nations pulled out of a summit with Putin next month in Sochi, where Russia hosted the Winter Olympics in February. Political analysts said Putin may have expected the rebels to go ahead with the referendum, showing that they were not under his orders. By distancing himself from a process that will not be recognised by the West Putin may also be hoping to avoid further sanctions as their effect begins to be felt in Russia. Maria . Lipman, an expert at the Carnegie Center think-tank in Moscow, said . Putin would have known that his request for the referendum to be . postponed would be rebuffed. ‘But . this can be used to show that the people in Ukraine's east are not . Russians, take no orders from Russia, that Russia exercises no control . over them because they only do what they want to do,’ she said. ‘He . has also distanced Russia from the referendum, which has a completely . unclear status and will not be recognised by the West.’ Russia's defence ministry said Nato were misleading the world about the armed confrontation between Moscow and Kiev. It said the pro-Western Ukrainian government had assembled 15,000 troops on its border with Russia. Nato said that it has not seen any evidence of Russian troops being pulled back from the border. 'I have very good vision but while we've noted Russia's statement so far we haven't seen any - any - indication of troops pulling back,' Nato Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said in a post on Twitter. Nato has accused Moscow of using special forces in the separatist takeover of mainly Russian speaking eastern Ukraine after annexing Crimea from Ukraine in March. Russia admitted its troops had been active in Crimea after initially denying any role there but says it is not involved in eastern Ukraine. The ministry said it had asked the West to stop ‘cynically misinforming’ the international community. The rebel decision to go ahead with the referendum appeared to have wrong-footed the West. The European Union said shortly before the announcement that it was waiting to see whether Putin's words would be followed by deeds and that the plebiscite ‘would have no democratic legitimacy and could only further worsen the situation’. At the same time, the Russian ambassador to Paris said Putin, who had been shunned by Western leaders since the Crimean takeover, would join them in a ceremony to mark the 70th anniversary of the Normandy landings in World War Two. Britain's attempts to isolate Russia risk being undermined by former cabinet member Lord Mandelson, who is listed as a confirmed attendee of the St Petersburg International Economic Forum, organised by Putin. Moral support: Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk, right, shakes hands with Ukrainian soldiers at a block post on the road at Slovyansk . One analyst said that going to the event, which the Foreign Office doesn't expect any UK ministers to attend, could make Lord Mandelson look like a 'Kremlin lackey'. Dr Andrew Foxall, director of the Russia Studies Centre at the Henry Jackson Society think tank, told the Telegraph: 'If the West is to demonstrate that Russia is isolated because of its actions in Ukraine then boycotting the forum is an important step.' The referendum has become seen as a vital step by many in Ukraine's industrial east, fired up over what the rebels, and Moscow, call the ‘fascist’ government in Kiev. Controversial: Lord Mandelson has been accused of being a 'Kremlin lackey' for accepting an invite from Putin to attend a summit in St Petersburg . Putin's call for its postponement was intended to open the way to negotiations on cooling down a crisis that has led to dozens of deaths in clashes between troops and separatists in eastern Ukraine and rival groups in the southern port of Odessa. Putin said on Thursday it was Kiev's ‘irresponsible politics’ that had caused the crisis. Artyom, a rebel at a roadblock in the rebel-held eastern town of Slaviansk, said of the referendum decision: ‘This is great news. We need to have our say.’ In a further shift towards a confrontational stance, Putin oversaw test launches of military rockets during training exercises held across Russia on Thursday, the day before celebrations of the anniversary of its World War Two victory. The West has accused Russia of using previous military exercises to build up forces along the border with Ukraine after the ousting of former Moscow-backed president Viktor Yanukovich in February.","Putin said that the eastern Ukraine referendum should be postponed .

"By . Jennifer Newton . Nearly 300 schoolgirls kidnapped in Nigeria by Islamist militants could be released in exchange for jailed comrades, a former negotiator has reportedly said. The group snatched the girls from their boarding school in Chibok in the lawless Borno region in the north of the country. A former mediator who once brokered peace talks with the group has told the Telegraph he believes the video, where Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau threatens to sell the girls as slaves, shows he plans to use them as ‘bargaining chips’ rather than kill them. Scroll down for video . A grab taken from a video obtained by French news agency AFP which shows the leader of Islamist group Boko Haram, Abubakar Shekau (centre), vowing to sell hundreds of captured schoolgirls as sex slaves . Shekau (centre) claimed responsibility on Monday for the abduction of more than 200 schoolgirls during a raid in the village of Chibok in northeast Nigeria last month . Shehu Sani says he believes that the footage, released on Monday, was an attempt to persuade the Nigerian government into a prisoner trade. He told the newspaper: ‘From my knowledge of the group, to have him saying that he will sell them is proof that this issue can be resolved. ‘The group is most likely to want to attach some kind of conditions to the girls being released, such as the freeing of some of their own prisoners.’ The brazenness of the kidnap has shocked Nigerians, who have been growing accustomed to hearing about atrocities in the five-year-old Islamist insurgency in the north . In the video, the Boko Haram leader is seen dressed in combat fatigues standing in front of an armoured personnel carrier and two pick-up trucks mounted with sub-machine guns. He then declares: 'I abducted your girls. I will sell them in the market, by Allah.' Shekau then takes a swipe at democracy, Western education, efforts for Muslims and Christians to live in peace and rails against non-believers in Islam.

Militants are said to have gunned down groups of unarmed civilians and set fire to a number of buildings, including a police station, during the rampage in Borno State.

On Tuesday it was reported that British Special Forces were on standby to help in the rescue effort to free the missing girls. The director of Special Forces has told the Foreign Office that UK personnel could support the Nigerian armed forces with drones, intelligence, military planning or even join a rescue. However, top brass are reluctant to take part in a raid after the botched SBS mission in which British construction worker Chris McManus, 28, was executed by his Nigerian kidnappers in March 2012. The White House has also branded the kidnapping an ‘outrage and tragedy’ and the State Department said the US would send a ‘co-ordination cell’ including military personnel and law experts to Nigeria.","Shehu Sani says the girls are being used as 'bargaining chips'

"By . Steph Cockroft . A 'bold initiative' which will see drivers banned from overtaking cyclists on designated 'cycle streets' could be introduced in cities throughout the UK in a bid to reduce the number of road deaths. The proposed move would introduce a new 15mph speed limits on certain roads, where cyclists would also be given priority over motorists. Under the government plans, police would be able to issue a £100 fine or three penalty points to any drivers who flout the new rules. Scroll down for video . The introduction of 'cycle streets', proposed by the Department for Transport, would see bicycles have priority over motorists on dozens of roads across the UK . The scheme, which is being mooted in an attempt to reduce deaths among cyclists, is likely to be introduced in London, as well as the Government's 'cycle cities' - Manchester, Birmingham, Newcastle upon Tyne and Oxford. It is the latest move in a string of measures attempting to reduce some of the 19,000 injuries which are caused to cyclists on the UK roads each year. The scheme, which has been championed by . the roads minister Robert Goodwill, has been laid out in a consultation document issued by . the Department for Transport. In the document it says: 'This is a bold initiative, which is being considered by some of the cycle cities and London, possibly including a ban on overtaking on lightly-trafficked roads where cycle flows are high. 'Subject to any scheme trial, this prohibition could be accompanied by an advisory speed limit of 15 mph is being considered by some of the cycle cities and London, possibly including a ban on overtaking on . lightly-trafficked roads where cycle flows are high'. 'Cycle streets' are already widely used in the Netherlands and . Germany to give priority to cyclists over motorists on minor streets. But in the Netherlands, cycle . streets are only used where cyclists outnumber motorists by two to one, a situation rarely seen in Britain. Other measures included in the consultation include creating pedestrian and cycle zones where they are currently known as ‘no motor vehicles’ zones. It would mean cyclists are allowed in areas where cars are banned. The consultation also proposes introducing a new priority crossings for cyclists. The scheme is likely to be introduced in London and the UK's so-called 'cycle cities', which include Manchester, Birmingham, Oxford and Newcastle upon Tyne . Under the plan, cycle routes would be placed . next to zebra crossings markings, forcing drivers to give way to . cyclists when crossing between cycle lanes. The consultation on the document ends next month, meaning the scheme could be implemented before the general election. Over the past few years, several other measures have been developed in a bid to increase road safety for cyclists. Last year, a new electronic laser device that creates a bike lanes for a cyclist was unveiled by Hammacher Schlemmer, a company based in the US. Last year, the Cyclist's Virtual Safety Lane - an electronic laser device which creats a bike lane in the dark - was unveiled by Hammacher Schlemmer, a compnay based in the US . The Cyclist's Virtual Safety Lane, which is the same size as a deck of cards, mounts to the rider's saddle post and uses a laser to project two lines either side of the bicycle. The tiny device is visible under headlights or streetlights and gives motorists an indicator of where the cyclist is. The red . lane begins at the bike's seat and extends past the rear wheel - giving . drivers a clear sight of the space they need to allocate to the cyclist. Earlier this year, new bike lights designed by behavioural scientist and keen cyclist Crawford Hollingworth that display the international symbol of the cyclist were hailed as a major breakthrough in road safety. Research carried out by the University of Oxford suggests the bike symbol distinguishes cyclists from the blizzard of lights that streak the roads up and down the country. The Greater London Authority is also building super cycle highways around the capital, to reduce congestion and increase safety on the roads. Four of the 12 planned super highways have already been built. Over the last decade, cycling has grown in London alone by 70 per cent. On major roads, the number of cyclists has increased by 173 per cent. This still only translates to two per cent of all journeys and falls short of many other UK and European cities. But road safety is still a key factor. Between 2006 and 2011, the number of cycling casualties rose by half. Cycling accounts for 20 per cent of deaths and serious casualties on the roads.","Under Government proposals, existing roads would turn into 'cycle streets'

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . It looks as though it’s lying in wait to sting unsuspecting beachgoers. But in fact this giant jellyfish is harmless to humans – and a long way from home. Usually found in the Atlantic or the Mediterranean, the creature was spotted by wildlife photographer Steve Trewhella in Portland, Dorset, and is one of ten seen recently along the south coast. Experts say there could be an influx of these barrel jellyfish – up to 3ft 2in in diameter – over the next few months due to warmer weather. 'Invasion': The latest in a string of barrel jellyfish sightings has been reported on a beach in Portland, Dorset. Above, wildlife photographer Steve Trewhella poses with the enormous creature, measuring 3ft in diameter . Richard Harrington of the Marine . Conservation Society said: ‘Although this species is harmless … we still . advise the public not to touch them.’ It comes just days after a jellyfish the size of a dustbin lid was sighted on the island by dog walker Suzanne Sheldon. Following her discovery, Ms Sheldon, 47, said: 'It was at least three feet in width and was very bulky too. It was the largest jellyfish I had ever seen.' Experts have warned that there could be an influx of the sea creatures as the weather warms up. Enormous: Experts have warned that we could see an influx of the sea creatures as temperatures soar to 20C toward the end of May. Above, the jellyfish which was spotted by the 49-year-old photographer, from Wareham . Washed up: Mr Trewhella believes the huge creature was washed ashore during strong winds and high tides . Forecasters expect high pressure to take hold later in May - sending temperatures soaring above 20C. In recent weeks, up to 10 barrel jellyfish have been spotted washed up on beaches around the South Coast. High numbers: In recent weeks, up to 10 barrel jellyfish have been spotted washed up on beaches around the south coast. Left, the jellyfish spotted by Mr Trewhella and, right, local Julie Hatcher poses with another jellyfish . Mr Harrington added: 'This is an Atlantic species and are sometimes found washed up but we still advise the public not to touch them.' But Mr Trewhella believes the creatures have come ashore because of strong winds and high tides. 'It's not that unusual to see jellyfish, they aren't particularly common in Dorset but we do see them every once in a while,' said the photographer. 'Jellyfish are a form of plankton, and the warm weather means we might see an increase in the levels of plankton. Another finding: It comes just days after a jellyfish the size of a dustbin lid was sighted on a beach in Portland . 'This is something that occurs around this time every year and it is known as the plankton boom. 'However, it is not the warm weather that causes jellyfish to wash up, instead it's the wind and tides that leave them stranded on beaches. 'I think we will see more strandings because of the on-shore winds and the tides, but people should be careful not to touch them.' 'Very bulky': Dog walker Suzanne Sheldon, who discovered the creature, said it was 'at least three foot in width' Barrel jellyfish - Rhizostoma pulmo in Latin - are often known as dustbin-lid jellyfish because of their enormous size. They are commonly found in the north east Atlantic, Adriatic, and Mediterranean sea and are prey to leatherback turtles. Experts have warned that some of the jellyfish can sting and anyone affected should seek medical attention.","Latest in string of barrel jellyfish sightings reported on beach in Portland .

"By . Mark Duell . Injuries: Mother-of-three Kate Stone, of Cambridge, thought she was going to die after the attack . An academic today revealed her miraculous survival - and how she has been scarred for life - after a stag impaled her throat with its antlers. Kate Stone thought she would die after being gored in Lochailort in the Scottish Highlands, which saw doctors put her into an induced coma and perform two operations on her windpipe. Medical experts said the 44-year-old University of Cambridge electronics researcher was lucky not to have been paralysed from the neck down. Dr Stone said: ‘It's a miracle I survived - especially when you consider that if a car hits a stag, the car's usually a write-off. But I believe it was part of my path in life - and part of that path was that I survived. I suppose I could wallow in what's happened, feel sorry for myself and ask “Why me?”, but I don't see the point.' Dr Stone was holidaying at the end of last year when a startled stag charged towards her. It knocked her over, impaling her throat. She added: ‘I was never attacked. The stag got spooked, ran and I just happened to be in the way. I didn't feel any pain, but looked down and saw a lot of blood and I was gurgling and struggling to breathe. My initial thought was I was going to die - but on reflection it was probably more traumatic for my friends, watching and helpless, than it was for me.’ Within 40 minutes, she was off to hospital in Fort William. She was then airlifted to be treated by specialists at Southern General in Glasgow. The antler had gone through Dr Stone’s airway, fractured her neck, smashed her throat, damaged the nerves to her vocal cords, carried on through her oesophagus and hit her spine. But it stopped just short of her spinal cord, which was something of a miracle considering it almost severed a main artery, which would have caused Dr Stone to bleed to death. A fraction deeper and there was a chance she would have been paralysed from the neck down. Doctors put Dr Stone into a coma and operated on her windpipe. She added: ‘I woke up a week later - but I wasn't myself until about a week after that.’ Close: A fraction deeper and there was a chance she would have been paralysed from the neck down . Dr Stone, who has three children, said that the worst thing was the mental experience rather than the physical recovery. She . added: ‘People think when you wake up from a coma, you go straight back . to normal. But I had crazy hallucinations which carried on after I woke . up. In fact, it took over a week for me to get sane again.’ Her . vivid hallucinations morphed voices and sounds she could hear on the . ward into characters and scenarios in her head and she became trapped in . a world which blended the fictional with the real. She . added: ‘It was a very scary and dark time. Like a recurring bad dream. I . was acting like a crazy person, trying to reach out to touch and talk . to people who weren't there. ‘I . felt like I was losing my mind - and my sister thought I was going . nuts. All sorts of bizarre stuff was going on, from surgeons trying to . replace my brain to Snoop Dogg hiding in the toilet.’ Fortunate: Medics said the electronics researcher was lucky not to have been paralysed from the neck down . As the strong painkillers wore off, Dr Stone began to come round. But months later she still finds herself haunted by the bizarre 'trips'. 'It was a very scary and dark time. Like a recurring bad dream. I was acting like a crazy person, trying to reach out to touch and talk to people who weren't there' Kate Stone on her hallucinations . ‘I have flashbacks and nightmares,’ said Dr Stone, who spent much of her recovery at her sister Claire Bee's home in Dundee. ‘People think I made a miraculous recovery - and physically I did. But the mental scars will take a lot longer to heal.’ After her initial operations, Dr Stone had to learn to walk, talk, write and even eat again. But it was a welcome challenge for the . child of a continent-hopping engineer father, who spent her younger . years ‘in the company of bears in Yosemite, with monkeys in the garden . in Brunei or having picnics in the Oman desert’. ‘I faced it head on,’ she said. ‘When . the doctors said they were transferring me to the ward, I was determined . I'd walk out with my head held high, rather than be wheeled in a chair. Location: Dr Stone was holidaying in Lochailort, a remote hamlet in the Scottish Highlands, at the end of last year when a startled stag charged towards her. The incident happened near the gate (pictured) ‘The first day, I needed three people to . help me out of bed. I took two steps on the spot, then vomited. The . following day, I walked the length of the ward. It took all my strength . but I was determined. 'My initial thought was I was going to die - but on reflection it was probably more traumatic for my friends, watching and helpless, than it was for me' Dr Stone on the incident itself . ‘With my voice, I got vowel sounds back initially, then had to learn how to breathe when speaking. Even now my voice is still croaky. But every time something came back, it was like being given a gift. ‘It's only after losing the things you take for granted that you realise how lucky you are.’ Until just a few weeks ago, Dr Stoneneeded to be fed through a nasogastric tube, but the dedicated vegan is now back on solids. She has lost a stone, but claims she is back to her 'perfect weight'. Last week, Dr Stone returned to living and working at her print company Novalia in Cambridge, which she continued to run from her hospital bed - holding conference calls on Skype.","Kate Stone thought she would die after incident in Scottish Highlands .

But the only thing in the skies over Merseyside was an aircraft sent by Manchester United fans mocking Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard over his lack of league titles. Cruel Manchester City fans also thanked Steven Gerrard for his slip at Chelsea which cost Liverpool a vital game, followed by an unlikely draw against Crystal Palace when the Merseyside team were three goals up with 20 minutes left in the game. While Manchester City fans decided Steven Gerrard should be reminded of his unfortunate slip against Chelsea which derailed his league dreams . Manchester City fans ran onto the pitch at the end of the game to celebrate their league victory . A young Liverpool fan is comforted as he can barely watch his team after they blew their best ever chance of winning the Premier League . After dropping those five points, Manchester City started today's game knowing that all they needed to do was avoid defeat and they would be crowned champions. Fans in Anfield and Manchester had portable radios to keep track of the score in the other game. When word reached Manchester that Liverpool defender Martin Skrtel had scored an own-goal, the stadium erupted. Minutes later, Manchester City scored, leaving Liverpool an impossible task. Even two late Liverpool goals were too late as City were cruising to an easy 2-0 victory. Sergia Aguero holds aloft the Premier League trophy after his team's 2-0 victory against West Ham .

"By . Mark Duell . In such a data-rich world, it’s often a struggle to wade through the numbers and work out what they are telling us - especially when it comes to London. But two researchers have tried their best to crack this problem after spending two years trying to map the capital’s social and political dividing lines. The University of Oxford professors have used size-based maps to bring to life statistics as diverse as the rise in bankers and the fall in hedgehogs. Distribution: This map shows where bankers tend to live within London, with a large number around Canary Wharf and in Kensington and Chelsea . Hedgehogs: There were 1,272 sightings of them in Richmond-upon-Thames last year, but none in the City and only five in Kensington and Chelsea . Shapes and sizes: These maps show the increases in the value of housing in England last year, compared to what was sold in 2012 - with a huge rise in London . Danny Dorling and Benjamin Hennig have made 300 maps for the London Mapper project, two more of which show unemployment and air pollution. And there are huge gaps, such as the life expectancy difference between Hackney and the West End being the same as England and Guatemala. Their graphics are distorted according to the numbers - so higher house prices in Westminster than Enfield will mean that area is far more stretched out. The hedgehogs map shows London boroughs resized according to recorded sightings by the Greenspace Information for Greater London group. Capital gains: This reference map shows all the boroughs of London with their individual colours given by the University of Oxford researchers . Diversity: This map shows net household weekly income in the capital after tax, based on ward-level estimates, with the higher values in darker colours . Educational achievement: This is the capped GCSE point score for pupils across London in 2010, with blue and green representing the highest levels . There were 1,272 sightings of them in Richmond-upon-Thames last year, but none in the City and only five in Kensington and Chelsea. Other animal sightings which have been mapped by the researchers include peregrine falcons, stag beetles, muntjac deer, reported The Observer. Professor Dorling told the newspaper: ‘These maps are like fancy pie charts, and if something is twice the size of something else it is obvious. ‘We probably have more quality data [on London] than anywhere else. That's partly because the British are obsessed with collecting numbers.’ Children in poverty: This map shows the percentage of dependent children receiving child tax-credit and in out-of-work families. Red and orange are the worst areas . Ages: This life expectancy graphic shows how things are much better for people living in Kensington and Chelsea (over 82), while it can be less than 77 in East London . The map of property prices shows an enormous increase in London between 2012 and last year, compared to other areas of England and Wales. This was over a period when the total value of housing in Kensington and Chelsea jumped by £1billion, and in Westminster by £921million. Another interesting figure was the number of Jews in parts of London – 54,000 just in Barnet, but only 9,000 south of the River Thames. And a map which shows where bankers tend to live within London, with a large number around Canary Wharf and in Kensington and Chelsea. Professor Dorling added: ‘There is an incredible increase in capacity to understand abstract concepts, images and maps, generation by generation.’","Graphics distorted according to numbers, so higher house prices in Westminster means that area is stretched out .

"By . Steph Cockroft . As the debate rages on in the US about what is most to blame for the nation's obesity problem, a new film is claiming the real danger behind the epidemic is sugar. Fed Up, a film released in the US this week, predicts 95 per cent of Americans will be overweight or obese in the next two decades, unless something is done to tackle the so-called hidden sugars which appear in everyday foods. Producer Laurie Davies - who was also behind the 2006 film Inconvenient Truth which studied the myths surrounding global warming -  warns in the film that one third of adults will also have diabetes by 2050, as our brains become increasingly dependent on sugar. Scroll down for video . Fed Up, a film which looks into the approach to dieting and weight-related health problems , pictured above, says sugar and not fat is to blame for the rise in obesity rates . In the film, one of the interviewees Dr Mark Hyman, chairman for the Institute for Functional Medicine, says sugar is a 'fundamental problem' which noone is talking about. He said: 'The message has been pushed onto us: it is your fault you're fat. Forget about it.' Dr David . Kessler, a former Food and Drug Administration commissioner, goes one step father, predicting that the obesity crisis fuelled by sugar will end up as 'one of . the greatest public health epidemics of our time'. 'We are toast as a country', he tells the film. The expert comments come after researchers behind the film found that, of the 600,000 food items in the US, a staggering 80 per cent have added sugar. The film . claims fast-food chains and the makers of processed foods add more sugar to 'low fat' foods to make them more palatable. Dr Mark Hyman, chairman for the Institute for Functional Medicine, tells the new film that sugar is a 'fundamental problem' which noone is talking about . But the . truth about how damaging this can be for a person's health has remained hidden behind supposedly-healthy food labels - because manufacturers need to rely on sugar to make their food, the film claims. According to Gary Taubes, an author interviewed for . the film, blaming willpower for obesity - as has been the way for several years - is a 'crime'. 'Your brain lights up to sugar just as it does with cocaine and heroin, meaning you are going to become an addict' Instead, the film claims that obesity could be started by the human brain's reaction to sugar. The human brain 'lights up to sugar just as it does with cocaine and heroin', according to one expert. It means people who are unwittingly eating sugar will become addicted to the ingredient. Michael Pollen, writer of the book The Omnivore's Dilemma, also tells the film that, by not implementing laws to stop so much sugar being used, the government is 'subsiding the obesity epidemic'. According to the film, the . problem means early-onset diabetes - a condition associated with . exposure to cane sugar and corn syrup - will be a medical condition in one in . three Americans by 2050, if current rates continue. In two decades, 95 per cent of Americans will also be overweight or obese, according to the film. A study of the brain shows that humans react in the same way to sugar as they do to cocaine which causes addiction, the film says . The idea that sugar, rather than fat, causes both obesity and diabetes has been gaining support among diet and health experts for the past few years. In January, . an alliance of doctors and academics described sugar as 'the new . tobacco', blaming it for a range of health problems and early death. Fructose is found in fruit, sucrose (table sugar) and in high fructose corn syrup. It is a simple sugar and is sweeter than glucose. Sucrose (the sugar that we commonly add to food) is made up of 50 per cent glucose and 50 per cent fructose. High fructose corn syrup (containing more fructose than glucose) commonly replaces sucrose in the US food industry because it is both sweeter and cheaper. In the UK, it can also be labelled as ‘glucose-fructose syrup’ or ‘HFCS’. Because it causes a lower blood sugar spike than sucrose or glucose, and therefore has a low glycaemic index, manufacturers are allowed to claim that fructose is ‘healthier’ than the other two. But some scientists claim the problem with fructose is twofold. Firstly, there is no hormone to remove fructose from our bloodstream . (unlike glucose, which stimulates insulin production). It is therefore left to the liver to . remove it. When the liver is overwhelmed it converts fructose to . liver fat, which ups our chances of developing insulin resistance (a . precursor to diabetes), hardened arteries and heart disease. Secondly, . fructose suppresses the hormone leptin, which tells you when you’re . full. In other words, your brain lets you consume it without limit. A US study last year carried out by the University of California found that for every 150 calories of extra sugar people had each day, the prevalence of diabetes in the country rose by 1 per cent in the population. Mark Bittman, a columnist for the New York Times, supports this point, telling the film how junk food companies are acting like 'tobacco companies were 30 years ago'. The claims about sugar come after some scientists say illnesses that typically show up in the obese are also apparent in those who have average weight. Scientists claim this must be due to exposure to sugar. But efforts to curb the sugar industry have largely failed. In the US, . the Bush administration threatened to withhold funding to the World . Health Organisation in 2003, if it published nutritional guidelines which suggested no more than 10 per cent of calories per day should come from . sugar. Campaigners are now calling for health warnings on some foods, as well as equal advertising time to marketing fresh fruit and vegetables. They also want voluntary agreements to reduce sugar content. The problem is particularly apparent in low-fat . versions of foods such as yoghurts, fizzy drinks and spreads, in which natural sugars are swapped for sugar substitutes. But many other leading scientists say there is not yet enough evidence to prove sugar has the harmful effect some campaigners are claiming. Sugar Nutrition UK said the World Health Organisation published a review last year that found that any link between diabetes and body weight was due to over-consumption of calories and was not specific to sugar. Barbara Gallani, of the Food and Drink Federation, an industry group, also denied sugar was responsible for obesity. She said the industry already provided clear information on sugar levels to consumers, using figures and colour-coded labels. In Briton, the typical person consumes 12 teaspoons of sugar a day and some adults consume as many as 46. The film, produced by Laurie David, former wife of Seinfeld creator Larry David, is narrated by TV journalist Katie Couric. It was released this week in America.","New film Fed Up warns it is sugar and not fat which is causing obesity .

"By . Sam Webb . A grandfather who was given just two years to live after being diagnosed with leukaemia is in remission - just weeks after taking a new 'miracle' drug that could give new hope to millions of cancer sufferers. Douglas Clarke was one of just 100 patients across the world chosen to try the new anti-cancer treatment. Doctors put the 59-year-old forward for the drug trial while he was waiting for a life-saving bone marrow transplant from his brother. Just three weeks into the trial the dad-of-three was told he was in remission and could live for another 30 years. New lease of life: Douglas Clarke with his wife Kerry Clarke and his son Bradley. Mr Clarke is in remission from cancer after trying an experimental drug . Today, Mr Clarke, who lives in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, with his wife Kerry, 42, and their son Bradley, nine, said he felt like he had 'won the lottery'. He said: 'Thanks to this miracle drug I feel brilliant. A weight has been lifted off my shoulders. 'I was the guinea pig - but I couldn't have asked for a better treatment. 'This treatment could be used for everyone who has leukaemia as an alternative to the bone marrow transplant. 'I now have to take these tablets for the rest of my life. It has given me another 30 years of my life instead of the two-and-a-half the doctor said before I took the drug. ABT-199 is currently in the second phase of development but medics hope it will go on the market. 'My family has kept me going throughout. This whole thing has made me look at life differently. 'When they told me I was in remission it was like winning the lottery. I've had a lot of support and I just can't believe the results.' Douglas, who works as a caretaker at a golf club, was diagnosed with Chronic Lymphonic Leukaemia (CLL) in 2011 and was preparing for a bone marrow transplant this year. But he was offered a life-changing chance to take part in a trial of the new ABT-199 anti-cancer drug at The Christie Hospital in Manchester which started last month. The trial saw grandad-of-four Douglas take four tablets a day every day until he reached the maximum dosage. And remarkably, after just three weeks his swollen lymph nodes had reduced and his bone marrow had returned to normal - killing off the leukaemia. Douglas, who has two sons Shane, 40, and Adam, 32, from a previous marriage, added: 'I was working at the golf club in 2011 when I had a twinge in my back. 'So I went to the doctors and when I was there I asked them to take a look at some lumps on my neck. 'I had a blood test and was referred to hospital and they did tests and scans and told me I had CLL. 'I had chemotherapy which put it in remission for 18 months but then I noticed the lumps were back at the end of 2012.They referred me to a consultant in Birmingham to talk about a bone marrow transplant and we found my brother Keith was a perfect match. 'The consultant said if you don't have the bone marrow then I can give you just two years to live. 'I could've had the bone marrow but because of the tests on my brother it was going on and on and then they offered me the trial in Manchester. 'After just three weeks the consultant said he couldn't even feel the lymph nodes and said he can guarantee I am in remission. Mr Clarke was one of just 100 patients across the world chosen to try the new anti-cancer treatment . 'It felt like a great big lump of concrete has been lifted off my shoulders.. I don't think we've come down yet. 'It (the trial drug) gives hope to people that it can eradicate the process of going through a bone marrow transplant.' Douglas' wife, Kerry, said she feels 'very lucky' her husband took part in the trial. The catering supervisor, who has two daughters Katie, 21, and Tanisha, 18, also from a previous relationship, said: 'I was a bit sceptical about the drug at first but after the first week I could see it was working so I tried to support him.' Just three weeks after starting the drug his swollen lymph nodes had reduced and his bone marrow had returned to normal - killing off the leukaemia . She added: 'When we were told he was in remission I just burst into tears. I was so happy. Now we are trying to get back to normality. We haven't been able to go on holiday for the past three years so we are looking forward to that.' The drug has been manufactured in Australia to treat CCL sufferers. It is currently in the second phase of development but medics hope it will go on the market. Consultant haematologist Doctor Adrian Bloor, who has been overseeing the trial at The Christie, said the drug was so successful that he had cured patients in just an hour. ABT-199 switches off the Bcl-2 protein, allowing the CLL cells to die naturally and making them susceptible to chemotherapy, so it is more effective in killing cancer cells. The drug has been manufactured in Australia to treat CCL sufferers. It is currently in the second phase of development but medics hope it will go on the market. In a clinical trial in Melbourne last year, people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia who had an extremely poor prognosis achieved an 84 per cent response rate and the bone marrow cancer was cleared in 23 per cent of people. Anthony Steele, the Leukaemia Foundation of Australia’s Head of Support Services, said: 'This drug means people with an incurable cancer, who undergo many periods of intensive treatment, periods of remission and with an expectation that the disease will relapse, now have hope that a treatment will be made available to end this life-long cycle.' He said: 'We are one of a few centres in the world trialling it and it has been spectacularly successful, so much so that it caused quite a few problems at first. 'We even had a couple of patients die from taking it because their bodies could not cope with it. So we did have to go back to the drawing board. 'It came as a big surprise in terms of how spectacularly effective it was. It was outstanding and is a miracle drug. 'We have seen patients who have taken the drug and in just one hour they were clear of the disease. It is overwhelmingly effective. 'This drug has really transformed what we believed we could do. 'It would be very difficult for us to achieve what we have with other readily-available treatments, so there will be a lot of enthusiasm to try to get this on the market.'","Douglas Clarke could live for another 30 years thanks to ABT-199 .
He said being given all-clear was 'like winning the lottery'
The drug could revolutionise leukaemia treatment across the world ."
"By . Leon Watson . A British poker ace who disappeared from Spain after allegedly stealing more than £2.5 million from investors is living in fear that hitmen are coming to kill him at his bolthole in Berkshire. Playboy Nigel Goldman, who is being investigated by authorities in Spain and the UK, fled his Costa del Sol mansion in November. His whereabouts were then exposed when a newspaper tracked him down to a modest house in the picturesque village of Kintbury, where he lives under the alias Howard del Monte. But the 56-year-old, who counts James Hewitt and Sir Mark Thatcher among his social circle, is now convinced gang bosses want him dead. Scroll down for video . Fearing for his life: Nigel Goldman, from Birmingham, who is wanted by Spanish police after vanishing from his luxury Costa del Sol mansion amid a major cash probe . Goldman, who drove a red Ferrari, has been found living in a modest home in the picturesque village of Kintbury, Berkshire under the alias of Howard del Monte . He told The Sunday People: 'There is a bullet out there with my name on it. A guy came to the door a few days ago but I refused to open it. 'He shouted that I was ""a dead man"" and from an upstairs window I saw him pull a gun out of his pocket. 'It was terrifying. I know he was sent to murder me. I called the police but he drove off ad high speed before they arrived.' Goldman said he now fears someone will come back to 'finish me off'. Goldman is being investigated by the Guardia Civil and Action Fraud, the UK's fraud and internet crime reporting centre. Earlier . this year the only trace of Goldman since he vanished in Marbella was a . text message to a former employer three weeks ago which read: 'I did not set out to be a thief.' Spanish police were probing claims that the broker from Edgbaston in Birmingham, left people empty handed and unable to access their bank funds. Nigel Goldman, who is being hunted by police for allegedly stealing from investors, was found living in a semi-detached house in Berkshire . From the Costa del Sol to Berkshire: Nigel Goldman is being hunted by police for allegedly stealing more than 3million euros from investors . Goldman's lavish lifestyle seems to have been scaled down with his Ferrari being replaced with a Vauxhall Zafira . Police were unable to trace him after they received complaints about his . Tangier-based company, International Financial Investment. Ex-pat newspaper The Olive Press, based in Spain, tracked Goldman  down using details on his eBay account Bensons Emporium. He uses the site to buy and sell coins, stamps and antiques. It was reported his lavish lifestyle seems to have been scaled down with his red Ferrari being replaced with a Vauxhall Zafira. But a neighbour said: 'Everyone in the village knows he's Goldman, whatever name he goes under.' Geoff Whitton, originally from Cornwall, is trying to locate €20,000 he says he handed to Goldman.The 49-year-old writer said: ‘If he's a legitimate businessman, why hasn't he contacted me? 'I gave €10,000 in May, 2012, and €10,000 two months later. Goldman made me a profit for two months, then a loss for the same amount. Goldman is said to have moved in the same social circles as cad James Hewitt (left) and Sir Mark Thatcher . 'For the next one-and-a-half years, I was in limbo. He'd say, ""Just trust me and you will receive a profit in October 2013"".' Goldman, who enjoys swigging champagne and smoking expensive cigars, has a history of dishonesty, in his own book, 'High Stakes: How I Blew £14 million' published in 2006, he confesses being sent to prison twice for fraud. A review on his book reads: 'Goldman seems to show little remorse - and more than a little contempt - for the victims whose money he lived off so handsomely.' Despite his past, Goldman is claiming that he, and others, have been duped this time and believes his brokers were running a Ponzi scheme with everyone's money. From the Costa del Sol to this sleepy Berkshire village Kintbury . A Ponzi . scheme is an investment operation that pays returns to its investors . from existing capital or new capital paid by new investors, rather than . from profit earned by the individual or organisation running the . operation. Goldman . has admitted in writing to owing as much as £658,000 (€800,000). However a lawyer acting for investors who claim to have lost cash is . stating that he is chasing €3 million, a figure rising daily. Flashy Goldman made his name at some of the world's biggest poker tournaments around the world, winning thousands. Lawyer . Antonia Flores, said: 'So far we have spoken to victims in Almeria, . Malaga and Jaen. In our most recent estimate it looks like reaching €3 . million. 'The first thing he did right was openly admit to all his wrongdoings and say he paid for it and was a new man. 'That . was a success. People could not talk about his past, people actually . felt sorry for him. It is large scale, police have not yet issued an . arrest warrant, but they are not far from doing that.' Goldman . offered investments in a host of commodities including bullion, stocks . and shares although he is not a regulated financial advisor due to his . criminal convictions. Roger Parks, a neighbour and friend of Goldman said that he even tried to get him to invest, although he chose not to, he said: 'I have known him for 35 years. 'When he showed me the prospectus for International Financial Investments at his palatial rented home in Elviria a few months ago, I couldn't stopped laughing. 'By the way, has anyone else noted the initials of his company spell IFI, as if ""iffy""?' A spokesman for Action Fraud confirmed complains had been lodged with the organisation about Goldman. If those complaints are upheld, information gathered will be passed to either the Metropolitan Police or Fraud Investigation Bureau.","Nigel Goldman, 56, went on the run after police in Spain launched probe .

"More than half of British homeowners say they cannot find a tradesman they trust, a survey shows (library image) British homeowners are not doing maintenance and repair work because they cannot find builders and other tradesmen they can trust, according to a survey. Finding trusted tradesmen has become such a problem that housing stock could be in a state of disrepair across regions of the UK, the Homeowner Survey from the HomeOwners Alliance and TrustMark found. More than half of homeowners (58 per cent) said they had difficulty finding a trusted builder to help with repairs or improvements, with 12 per cent of these people not doing the work and 26 per cent delaying the project. Some 40 per cent carried out the repairs or DIY themselves, 27 per cent did only the essential work and 28 per cent used tradesmen they were uncertain about. HomeOwners Alliance chief executive Paula Higgins said: 'Doing repairs, maintenance or improvements to your home are some of the biggest challenges homeowners face, and they find it far more difficult than it should be to find a reliable builder or tradesman to help them. 'For many it is quite rightly a major cause of concern - we have all watched those TV shows about cowboy builders and how your dream can turn into a nightmare. 'What is particularly worrying is that desperate homeowners are finding it so difficult to find good builders that they resort to delaying work, or simply not doing it all. 'The difficulties of getting good builders mean our national housing stock is ending up in a state of disrepair, affecting the lives of millions of householders.' Liz Male, chairwoman of the government-endorsed TrustMark 'find a tradesman' scheme, said: 'A nation of homeowners is at the mercy of leaflets through the door or findanyoldbuilder.com websites because they don't have a network of local tradespeople they can turn to. 'The price we pay are homes lacking TLC, an ever-deteriorating housing stock and the financial burden of £1.9 billion a year paying to fix botched jobs by tradesmen who were just not qualified to do the work. 'This is a ridiculous situation when we know there are so many excellent tradespeople out there who are totally committed to doing quality work and excellent customer service.'

"By . Mark Duell . A grandfather of seven spent three years thinking he could die at any time - after being wrongly diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. Hospital porter Roger Mollison, 66, of Dundee, was warned he had just nine months to live after tests appeared to show he had developed lethal mesothelioma, caused by exposure to asbestos. He gave up his job and began chemotherapy in the hope of surviving. And in the following months he tried to make the most of the time he had left by spending it with his children and grandchildren. Hospital porter: Roger Mollison (pictured with his granddaughter Caitlin Mollison) was warned he had just nine months to live after tests appeared to show he had developed lethal mesothelioma . One of his biggest fears was not living long enough to see his son get married. But he survived to attend the ceremony, and to see two new grandchildren and two great-grandchildren born. Then, in March - almost three years after the original diagnosis at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee - he found his ‘cancer’ of the lungs was actually another non-life-threatening, asbestos-related condition. Mr Mollison, who is also a father of two, said: ‘I've spent almost three years fearing I'd die any time and my family have suffered horribly. I prepared to not be around for much longer. ‘And [I] went through the awful feelings that go with that. Then I was shocked to the core when they told me the original lab results were wrong and I'm still trying to come to terms with it. ‘It is wonderful to know that I am not dying but I have lost all confidence in doctors and don't know if I ever will regain it.’ Mr Mollison began suffering breathing problems several years ago. He was admitted to Ninewells before being referred to a specialist who performed a biopsy. Suspected mesothelioma was diagnosed - with exposure to asbestos in a previous job as an insulation engineer cited as a probable reason. Mr Mollison believed he was to become one of the 2,000 UK men whose lives are claimed by the disease each year. Victims are normally expected to live between six and 18 months. Told he could die at any time: Mr Mollison gave up his job and began chemotherapy in the hope of surviving . He was even visited by palliative care nurses who advised on how best to spend what time he had left. He agreed to undergo chemotherapy, and stunned staff in the oncology ward with his progress. Almost all people who undergo chemotherapy experience side effects. Some are as follows: . Other possible side effects include bruising, bleeding, mucositis, loss of appetite, dry skin, memory and sleep problems, sexual issues, diarrhoea, constipation and depression . Mr Mollison said they labelled him ‘their best patient’ after discovering he was regularly going cycling in between treatment sessions. The correct diagnosis only emerged after Mr Mollison instructed his lawyers, Digby Brown, to prepare a claim for compensation against the insurers of his former employers. They sent him for fresh tests after becoming suspicious about the length of time he had lived since the diagnosis. The second opinion confirmed Mr Mollison was ‘unlikely to have mesothelioma’. He said: ‘When I turned up for treatment staff at the oncology ward kept telling me I was their best patient. ‘My disease had not progressed to the end stage they expected and the truth only emerged when my lawyer questioned the diagnosis.’ His family say the ordeal of being told their husband, father and grandfather had only months to live has had a ‘horrendous’ impact. His wife Liz said: ‘We are hugely relieved Roger is not desperately ill but devastated about what we all went through. Surely these hospital tests should always be checked and rechecked.’ His solicitor Euan Love, of Digby . Brown, said: ‘The original pathologist said Mr Mollinson had . mesothelioma which is caused by asbestos. But our independent . pathologist's opinion says it is unlikely he does. ‘He . has other asbestos related conditions not immediately life-threatening. It has been extremely traumatic for him and indeed his family. Treatment: Mr Mollison began suffering breathing problems several years ago. He was admitted to Ninewells Hospital in Dundee (pictured) before being referred to a specialist who performed a biopsy . ‘We are discussing ways to resolve his case and obtain compensation for the asbestos-related conditions he does have and for what he has had to endure since his original diagnosis.’ Mr Mollison admits he is bitter about having to give up his hospital job after working there for six years. 'It is wonderful to know that I am not dying but I have lost all confidence in doctors and don't know if I ever will regain it' Roger Mollison . He said: ‘I loved my job and would have stayed on much longer. However, the terminal diagnosis made me give it up because I had so little time left to spend it with my family. ‘My daughter, Lynsey, and son Neil, were heartbroken and struggled to accept that I was dying. ‘We now have to tell people that I no longer have this death sentence and everyone is just as stunned as us. It is a huge struggle to take it all but we have to move forward and cope.’ He has been supported throughout by Asbestos Action Tayside charity. An NHS Tayside spokesman said: ‘Due to patient confidentiality, we cannot comment on individual cases. We would encourage Mr Mollison to contact us so we can look into his concerns further for him.’","Hospital porter Roger Mollison was warned he had nine months to live .

"By . Leon Watson . Premier League's Chief Executive Richard Scudamore is reported to have sent a series of sexist emails . The boss of the Premier League was involved in a series of sexist email conversations in which women were referred to as 'g***' and 'female irrationality' was mocked, it was revealed today . Richard ­Scudamore, who likes to be seen as a champion of equality within the game, exchanged the crude messages with senior colleagues. They were revealed by the married 54-year-old's former PA who received them automatically when she was working for the league last October, the Sunday Mirror reported. In one message, Scudamore mocked a former girlfriend saying he called her 'double decker' because she was 'happy for you to play upstairs, but her Dad got angry if you went below'. In another, the father-of-five told a lawyer friend who works on behalf of the Premier League to keep a woman colleague they nicknamed Edna 'off your shaft'. He also forwarded a 'male fairy tale' joke sent to him from a friend about a prince who was proposed to and said no, then lived happily ever after and 'banged skinny big t***** broads'. In one sleazy email exchange the lawyer . bragged to ­Scudamore: 'Have spent all day fending Edna off my graphite . shaft. She is terribly relentless isn't she?!' Scudamore, who has been chief of the Premier League since 1999, replied: 'Terribly! Must keep her off your shaft... graphite, sausage meat or flimsy . sponge.' Scudamore, who lives with his wife Catherine in a £1.8million home in Cirencester, Gloucestershire, has been at the forefront of promoting the growth of women's football and said the league strives to be at 'the leading edge' of the 'whole equality agenda'. In a statement issued to MailOnline, he apologised saying sending the emails was an 'error of judgement'. He said: 'These were private emails exchanged between colleagues and friends of many years. 'They were received from and sent to my private and confidential email address, which a temporary employee who was with the organisation for only a matter of weeks, should not have accessed and was under no instruction to do so. 'Nonetheless I accept the contents are inappropriate and apologise for any offence caused, particularly to the former employee. It was an error of judgement that I will not make again.' Richard Scudamore, Premier League chief executive, is a married father-of-five who lives in Cirencester, Gloucestershire . Scudamore, 54, has been chief executive of the Premier League since 1999 . Richard Scudamore, chief executive of the Premier League, leaves FA Headquarters in 2007 . In November Scudamore announced that the . Premier League and The Football League were joining forces with Sport England to provide new grassroots . women's and girls' football sessions for 14 to 25 year olds. He said: 'The aim of this programme is to increase participation in women and girls' football, and Premier League clubs are in a unique position to do that. 'Not only can they attract participants through the power of the badge, but critically, they can deliver a quality coaching experience. Clubs will be able to build on the success of Premier League 4 Sport, which was a trailblazer for Sport England's satellite club strategy, to get more individuals than ever playing our national game.' But following the exposure of his emails, campaigners for equality in sport have hit out at Scudamore. Kick It Out, the sport's equality and inclusion campaign sponsored by the Premier League, told the Sunday Mirror that ­Scudamore's behaviour was ­unacceptable. A spokesman said: 'Every employing organisation should have a disciplinary code covering staff conduct, and follow due process at all times when there is an allegation of sexist behaviour.' Shadow Equalities Minister Gloria de Piero told the paper: 'No one should use deeply offensive language like this. Football is a family game, with many women supporters, players and referees. It's time to kick sexism out of football.' Ruth Holdaway, CEO of the Women's Sport & Fitness Foundation, said: 'Sexism of any kind is deplorable. To see someone in the upper echelons of sport thinking it is okay to refer to women in this way, in private or otherwise, is utterly appalling. 'Let alone someone who has publicly supported the case for equality. There are so many people working within the industry who are trying to make a difference, to help change the landscape and the future for women in sport. 'To have someone in such a senior role talking about women in this way is unbelievably disrespectful and ultimately, hugely damaging.' Conservative MP Tracey Crouch, a ­qualified FA football coach and manager of a girls' youth team, suggested the language he used could damage the women's game. Ms Crouch said: 'It's disappointing at a time when he's trying to encourage more women to play football that he is using derogatory terminology like this. 'It's a difficult environment for a woman to be involved in, either as a player or an official, and, while most people have thick skins, it's important that somebody who is promoting the women's game shouldn't be using this sort of language.'","Richard ­Scudamore likes to be seen as a champion of equality in football .

With fourth place already secured, the Frenchman's attentions are firmly on his side's trip to Wembley and the chance to end the club's nine-year trophy drought. Speaking to arsenal.com, Wenger said: 'We go there to try to win the game. We want to finish on a high, we want to get 79 points and make it as tight as possible at the top. 'If you get to that level it shows you're ready to fight for the title again. From that basis we want to build on for next season and get over 80. 'Also, in preparing for the FA Cup final, it's important to feel that you play well in the game before.' Norwich head into Sunday's game effectively relegated, although Wenger believes the Canaries could make an immediate return to the top-flight. He said: 'They have a good squad, they have these parachute payments that allow you to at least live comfortably in The Championship so they have the chance to come up. 'I like Norwich because they always play good football and play with a good spirit. They are a team who deserves to be in the Premier League.'

"By . Mike Dawes . Jenson Button took to his bike with fiancee Jessica Michibata ahead of this week's Spanish Grand Prix. The British racer faces an uphill challenge to end McLaren's losing streak, which now stretches to 22 races – their worst run since 2004 –  on Sunday. But Button appeared in good spirits taking a 'selfie' as he and his model partner hit the road on two wheels. Say cheese: Jenson Button was all smiles with fiancee Jessica Michibata ahead of this week's Spanish GP . Button's compatriot Max Chilton meanwhile is hoping Marussia can finally break their points duck. With the team now in their fifth season in the sport, and after 81 races, the Banbury-based marque have yet to trouble the scorers. But the Marussia cars will be sporting considerable upgrades which Chilton would like to believe can propel him into the top 10. 'In the points? It's going to be hard, but we've quite good updates here, so I'd like to think we've a better chance than we had in the first few rounds of the year. We've got to hope they work,' said Chilton. Thinking man: Max Chilton believes Marussia can target a points finish at this weekend's race in Spain . 'Our car this year is quite impressive. In China I was following the likes of (Felipe) Massa and (Kevin) Magnussen. Through the corners I was not losing a huge loss of time on the overall lap. 'We've a pretty good car, and these updates should help.' The fact Chilton could closely match a Williams and a McLaren speaks volumes for Marussia's progress, even if he did finish an additional lap down on the duo come the conclusion. 'It shows how far we've come. This year we've made a good step. It's definitely promising,' added Chilton, who has finished all 23 races in which he has so far competed. 'You look at the car now and it looks a lot more impressive than in previous years. 'With this upgrade, I'm sure it's the same amount as the top teams bring to every single race, but for us it is a good step forward.' Picture perfect: The Circuit de Catalunya will play host to the fifth round of this year's championship . Crucially from Chilton's personal perspective the 22-year-old has scored the two 13th places - in Australia and Bahrain - that means Marussia are currently 10th in the constructors' championship. That, in turn, is keeping happy Chilton's personal sponsors who have helped him acquire his seat with the team. 'It's been a good start, not the dream start, but at the end of the day we're 10th, and that was our aim coming into the season,' said Chilton. 'It's certainly good on my side of the garage because my sponsors like me to do well, and I've scored the two 13th places which have counted for the team. 'Jules (team-mate Bianchi) did it last year, but for me to have finished well twice in four races is all good so far.'","Jenson Button took the selfie prior to this week's Spanish Grand Prix .

The left-back is valued at £30million and is a candidate to be named in Roy Hodgson’s England World Cup squad on Monday having made his international debut earlier this year. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Luke Shaw serenaded by Southampton fans . Talks: Luke Shaw will discuss his future with Southampton after the final Premier League game of the season . So far, Shaw has put speculation about his future to the back of his mind to concentrate on playing for Southampton but with the season drawing to a close, he doesn’t want a summer of uncertainty and is now seeking clarification from his current club. Chelsea and Manchester United are expected to lead the bidding for the young defender who has already played 66 first-team games even though he doesn’t turn 19 until July. Liverpool, Manchester City and Real Madrid also have an interest in Shaw, who is believed to be keen on a new challenge though he will want to be confident of playing regularly at any club he joins. The teenager has shown huge loyalty to Southampton in recent years, making a name for himself as one of the brightest talents in the country in the process. Wanted: Shaw, pictured challenging Wayne Routledge, is high on the radar of both Man United and Chelsea . But with England's elite clubs, in particular Chelsea and Manchester United, in the market for left-backs this summer, there is a feeling that this will be the summer he finally departs. The urgency to sign Shaw is unlikely to be as intense beyond the summer transfer window if Chelsea and United sign alternative left-backs, an issue that his advisors are aware of.

A bill of £30million will also be due for their new training ground and director Han Hofstetter has admitted: ‘It is a burden that has to be covered and will be covered.’ An added complication is the future of manager Mauricio Pochettino.

Rik Sharma: Another disgraceful goal for Real Madrid to conceed, and that's Charles' second of the game.

Brilliant play the young stopper, former Blackburn and Man City frontman Santa Cruz looked to be clean though on goal and perhaps should have done better. Koke is replaced by Adrian Lopez. Atletico frontman Villa receives the ball at the back post and shoots towards goal but Malaga goalkeeper Caballero gets his angles spot on to tip the effort over for an Atletico corner which, after a brief scramble, Malaga clear. Eliseu receives a yellow card for time-wasting after taking an age to take a throw-in with 39 minutes still to play. Malaga, five points above the drop, are themselves desperate for the points as they bid to climb away from the relegation zone.

Real HAVE to win tonight to stand any chance of catching their local rivals but are behind against Celta Vigo. 1. Atletico Madrid 892. Barcelona 863. Real Madrid 84 . Rik Sharma: Real Madrid have been pathetic so far and that goal sums up their display. Sergio Ramos was wandering on the edge of his own box and was robbed by Charles, who rounded Diego Lopez and smashed home with aplomb. Raul Garcia leaps highest to get his head to the ball in the opposition area but can only direct the ball wide. Atletico are really pushing for an opener but perhaps nerves are getting to them a little... Koke gets on the end of Juanfran's cross from the right but drags his effort wide. Rik Sharma: The closest we've come so far is a header from Charles after 30 minutes, getting on the end of a scooped ball into the box but nodding over the crossbar. Arda Turan is correctly yellow carded for going down far too easily in the box. The Turkish midfielder went down theatrically depsite the fact Malaga's Ignacio Camacho didn't appear to touch him. No place for that in football.  That was scandalous! With no goals to report on so far the top of La Liga currently looks like this... 1. Atletico Madrid 892. Barcelona 863. Real Madrid 85 . Messi dribbles past the Elche defence and fires a shot at goal but his effort is deflected and goes out for a corner which comes to nothing. Rik Sharma: Still a soporific affair at Balaídos and Celta Vigo have shaded the game.

Hodgson has told those players bound for the World Cup in Brazil to take a break this week, to rest and recharge their batteries after a long season. Rooney has been nursing a slight groin injury through the end of the season and has not played since Manchester United’s win against Norwich on April 26. Looking good: Wayne Rooney and wife Coleen at the Manchester United player of the year awards last week (left), ahead of the World Cup this summer where Rooney will be expected to shine for England . Hard working: Rooney has enjoyed a strong season personally for United, despite the club's struggles . He is not considered by Hodgson to be a doubt in any way and England will to have their talisman hungry to show what he can do when they arrive in Rio. 'If it's up to Wayne and wanting to do it, there's no doubt,' said Hodgson. 'We have nothing to fear with Wayne in that respect. Revealed: England manager Roy Hodgson (centre left) announced his World Cup squad on Monday . Time to shine: Rooney has endured a succession of injury-hit and frustrating tournaments with England . 'I'm more than happy for the players to forget football for a week and get mentally prepared for the weeks ahead, but Wayne has decided to take some physios with him and continue his programme so, when we meet up on the 19th, he'll be able to join in straight away. 'He has the attitude and desire. Has he got the ability? Yes he has. Let's hope he can show the form that makes Wayne Rooney what he is.' Since making a huge impression at Euro 2004, Rooney has failed to sparkle in big tournaments for England. His first World Cup in 2006 was preceded by injury fears and ended in a red card and he was subdued in South Africa four years later. At Euro 2012, he was banned for the first two group games. Hodgson was quick to play down fears that Rooney would again be carrying an injury into a major tournament with England and revealed his only slight concern was over the striker's United team-mate Phil Jones. 'We wouldn’t have selected anybody in this 23 if we seriously thought we’d be on tenterhooks with regards to his fitness,' said the England boss. 'The only one I’d say that seriously still poses a question is Phil Jones. His shoulder injury was a week ago. Everyone tells me and my research tells me that it’s a three week injury to be back fit and playing but we can’t guarantee that and as a result John Stones will be his replacement if we are not confident he will be fit.'","Wayne Rooney has been named as part of England squad for the World Cup .

Roy Hodgson will use celebrated psychiatrist Dr Steve Peters for his own mental preparation at the World Cup finals — and is hoping his players are open-minded enough to follow suit. Peters has worked with Liverpool this season and has been enthusiastically endorsed by the likes of Sir Chris Hoy and Victoria Pendleton after his work with the British Olympic cycling squad. He will join the England squad in Portugal next week and remain with them throughout the World Cup. ‘I’d like to think the players will be open to it,’ said Hodgson. ‘We’re not obliging players to see him. He’s there. I’m sure the Liverpool players will tell the others how they interact with him and what he does for them. Useful: Steven Gerrard (left) and other members of the Liverpool squad have worked with Dr Steve Peters this season . Wise words: Psychiatrist Dr Steve Peters will travel with the England squad to the World Cup . Option: England players including Daniel Sturridge (centre) will get the chance to speak to Dr Peters in Brazil . ‘I’m sure, as a result, a few of the other players will come up and say: “That’s interesting, I’d like him to have a chat with me, too”. Steven Gerrard and Raheem Sterling are two Liverpool players who will also be in Hodgson’s squad and have spoken about Peters’ role. And despite a week in which his most high-profile clients — Liverpool and Ronnie O’Sullivan — suffered significant setbacks, Peters is highly respected in the sport world. Although Hodgson insists that his role will not just be about converting penalties, Peters is likely to address that issue with players. ‘I’m not thrusting Steve Peters on the players,’ said Hodgson. ‘If we win or lose on penalties, it won’t be because Steve has joined us. ‘But there may be a penalty taker who has spent a bit of time with him, who takes a better penalty. But it’s not his responsibility at all.’ Peters’ work is explained in a book called the Chimp Paradox, in which he encourages people to understand how anxiety works in their mind, and explains that, for many people, their first response is an emotional one — similar to that which a chimpanzee might make. Hodgson added: ‘He will have a lot more work to do with me because at my age, unfortunately, my inner chimp has become very mischievous,’ said Hodgson. Faith: England boss Roy Hodgson believes Dr Peters will benefit his squad in South America . Been there, done that: Wayne Rooney is no stranger to World Cup heartbreak with England . ‘The difficulty is always when you read psychologist’s books, it’s not difficult to accept what they’re  saying and to see the sense and benefits in it. ‘The problem is when you’re in real life: can you find the right behaviour pattern that’s required at the time? That’s the difficult thing. ‘As Steve is always very quick to point out, our first reaction is always emotional and then the human side kicks in. He may help us control that emotional side better than we can. ‘I’ve always thought people like Steve Peters — who are close to teams  — can do as much of a job with the coaching team as they can with the players, because we have  a big influence on the players. ‘If they can help us get the right mind-set to say the right thing at the right time — take the pressure off whenever we can, put the pressure on when it’s necessary — that in itself would be beneficial. I have an open mind to it all. I’m looking forward to hearing what he’s got to say.’ Experienced: Dr Peters has worked with with sportspeople including Victoria Pendleton and the Team GB cycling team . Impact: Dr Peters has helped Brendan Rodgers and Liverpool mount a title challenge this season . Sven Goran Eriksson has said his biggest regret with England was not taking a sports psychiatrist with him to the 2006 World Cup finals to help the team cope — especially with penalties. Hodgson says that it would have been remiss of him not to take advantage of Peters’ expertise. ‘I was fortunate enough to be put in contact with him and found out he was a massive England fan and would be more than happy to help out in any way he could,’ said Hodgson. ‘I read his book, which I found fascinating. I know he’s done excellent work with Dave Brailsford, at  British Cycling, who is a friend of mine and told me a lot about him, and at Liverpool, with Brendan Rodgers and Steven Gerrard in particular. Mistake: Former Three Lions boss Sven-Goran Eriksson regrets not taking a sports psychiatrist to the 2006 World Cup . Relationship: Raheem Sterling (left) has worked with Dr Peters at Liverpool this season . ‘When he was prepared to make himself available, I’d have been very foolish not to take advantage of that. But there’s no pressure on him whatsoever. ‘He already works at Liverpool with some of the players, so I’m sure they’ll talk to him when he’s around, just as they do at Liverpool. I’ve got a very curious group of players, an open-minded group of players. ‘I wouldn’t be at all surprised if quite a few others wanted to come and speak to him and find out what he’s got to say — how they can better prepare mentally for matches.’","Psychiatrist Dr Steve Peters will work with England at the World Cup .

"By . Ian Parkes . Lewis Hamilton served up a psychological hammer blow to Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg with victory in the Spanish Grand Prix. It was Hamilton's fourth successive win, and the team's fourth consecutive one-two. This race, however, is likely to be one that will hurt Rosberg for some time ahead of Formula One's blue riband event in Monaco in a fortnight. Thumbs up: Lewis Hamilton was delighted with his maiden Spanish Grand Prix victory on Sunday . Although Hamilton was clean away from pole, the 29-year-old grumbled often throughout the race, complaining about oversteer, the back end of the car sliding out, graining on his tyres, his strategy, how much time he had lost to Rosberg in the pit stops. At times it was a nervous, tetchy Hamilton behind the wheel, whereas Rosberg appeared to drive serenely behind as he managed the gap to his championship rival. To give the German his shot at victory, Mercedes altered tyre plans from the first stop onwards, and as the race reached its denouement Rosberg reeled Hamilton in. Champagne moment: Hamilton (centre) celebrates his fourth consecutive F1 win on the podium . But despite finally managing to get within a second late on, Rosberg ran out of laps and not once had a crack at making a pass on Hamilton, who ultimately won by just 0.6 seconds. It means for the first time since June 2012 Hamilton now leads the drivers' standings, moving three points ahead of Rosberg who must be wondering what he has to do to triumph again. Hamilton also has history on his side because on every one of the 19 previous occasions a driver has won four in a row he has gone on to claim the world championship. As wins go, Hamilton's first in Spain, this one was crucial as he said: 'It means everything to me. Getting my first grand prix win here after being in the sport eight years, it's very difficult to put the feeling into words when you have a result like this. 'Never have I had a car like this, nor a gap like this to anyone before. 'But I know I wasn't fast enough. Nico was quicker, I struggled with the balance, but fortunately I was able to keep him behind. 'I really had to rely on my engineers a lot more to give me the gaps and try to find where I could find time, also with my settings as I was moving them up and down, really trying to find extra time.' Closely-fought: Hamilton (left) finished ahead of team-mate Nico Rosberg (right) by just 0.6 seconds . Despite the rivalry between the duo - and there was undoubted tension in the green room before they went on the podium as barely a word was exchanged between them - Hamilton insists they can remain friends. 'We've been racing together for a long time, so I don't see why not,' remarked Hamilton. As for Rosberg, he concurred, although his body language perhaps said different as he commented: 'Definitely yes, because we've been through this before. 'It's not the first time, and even back then we had discussions, debate, but always.... life goes on. You discuss it and life goes on.' Rosberg is determined Hamilton will not make it five wins in a row in Monaco, a race the former won from pole last year. 'Second place, I'm still close in the championship and with many more races to go,' said Rosberg. 'I'll be heading to Monaco where I'll put in a massive effort to go one better, to repeat the win from last year.' Massive effort: Rosberg is determined Hamilton will not make it five wins in a row in Monaco . Mercedes' dominance was such that Daniel Ricciardo finished 49 seconds adrift in his Red Bull, but at least this was a legitimate podium for the Australian who was disqualified from his home race in March. As for Ricciardo's team-mate Sebastian . Vettel, the reigning four-times champion conjured his best drive of the . season to put behind him a torrid weekend hit by gremlins, finishing . fourth after starting 15th. Williams' Valtteri Bottas was fifth, whilst Ferrari, winners here last year with Fernando Alonso, had to settle for sixth and seventh, with Kimi Raikkonen passed by the Spaniard just over two laps from home. Romain Grosjean hauled Lotus into the points for the first time in a problematic campaign with eighth, with Force India duo Sergio Perez and Nico Hulkenberg ninth and 10th. That left McLaren out of the points for the third successive race, with Jenson Button and Kevin Magnussen 11th and 12th, while Max Chilton was 19th in his Marussia.","Lewis Hamilton secures fourth successive win in Spanish Grand Prix .

"By . Bianca London . A woman has given a new meaning to the phrase 'hair raising' thanks to her ability to hang from the ceiling by only her, yes you guessed it - hair. Anastasia IV, real name Joanna Sawicka, is the only person in the UK to practice the ancient art of hair hanging and makes a living from her strong locks. She even holds the Guinness world record for lifting the heaviest weight with her hair but needs 2 bottles a day of conditioner to keep her super-strong barnet in tip-top condition. She even has it insured for £1m. Scroll down for video . Now THAT's hair raising! Anastasia IV, 26, from Poland, is the only person in the UK to practice the ancient art of hair hanging and holds the Guinness world record for lifting the heaviest with her hair . Her unique talent emerged when she decided to give up studying biochemistry in London and join a circus show. Anastasia, 26, said: 'The idea of running away to the circus was romantic. I had no idea I would end up doing something so crazy. But I've found my calling and it feels fantastic!' Although she originally came to the UK from Poland to study, when she met her then-boyfriend now husband, also a circus performer known as Hannibal Hellmurto, in a North London pub she gave it up to join him. It wasn't long before Anastasia was lying on beds of nails and sword swallowing but within two years she was looking to find her own niche act and chanced upon the ancient act of hair hanging. Thought to be a tradition practised by Chinese men, the art of hair hanging was almost forgotten before Anastasia started her training. Ouch! In the circus world, the skill is confined to families who pass their secrets about the tradition down through generations and it's a rather painful skill . Mad skills: Anastasia even managed to pull a 2.5 ton car 20 metres down London's Shaftesbury Avenue using her hair - but needs 2 bottles a day of conditioner to keep her super-strong hair in tip-top condition . Wow! Her husband and two helpers have to plait her wet hair in a specific style to make sure that her weight is distributed equally . It took months of effort for her to manage to hang from her hair and much like the training of an elite athlete, it often brought her to tears. Since then, she has spent four years perfecting her act and now when she's performing for captivated audiences all over the country she can spin so fast her face becomes a blur, all while hanging by the strands on top of her head. She even managed to pull a 2.5 ton car 20 metres down London's Shaftesbury Avenue using her hair. In preparation for performances with the Circus of Horrors, her acrobat team, she undergoes a lengthy hair care regime lasting an hour and a half. Her mane needs to be brushed thoroughly as any knots or tangles could weaken the rope-like structure her hair becomes. Her husband and two helpers have to plait her wet hair in a specific style to make sure that her weight is distributed equally and the strength of each hair, which can hold up to 100g, is being made the most of. Preparation is key: Her mane needs to be brushed thoroughly as any knots or tangles could weaken the rope-like structure her hair becomes - and she conditions it up for 6 times per day . Remember us? Anastasia, cente, and fellow acrobats, The Circus of Horrors, made it to the semi-final of Britain's Got Talent in 2011 . During a tour, Anastasia has to condition her hair five times a day: like most people first thing in the morning, then once in the middle of the day and then another bout just before she starts a show. As soon as she finishes a performance she reconditions, leaving it to soak in for an hour, and then it's the last thing she does before she goes to bed. Anastasia said: 'To be suspended by your hair feels exactly how it looks. It is definitely not a pleasant act to learn and can be painful at times. 'But I've been doing it for four years now and it feels more like a sensation now rather than pain. 'The first few times I tried hair hanging it was quite scary but it also felt fantastic. It is the closest a person can get to actually flying as you are lifted by your head. 'Unlike in other more classical aerial acts your hands and feet are absolutely free and you are not holding on to anything. It's exciting. 'It's also really special. Hair hanging is not something you can learn in any circus school - the secrets of plaiting the hair are passed down generation to generation. 'Thankfully I don't have any split ends!' Hair hanging is when a performer is suspended by their hair and performs acrobatic poses . Rumour has it that it originated in South America or China . A single strand of hair can carry up to 100 grams . In the circus world, the skill is confined to families who pass their secrets about the tradition down through generations . The hair must be tied to the rig so that the weight of what they're carrying is evenly distributed .","Anastasia IV holds Guinness world record for pulling 2.5 ton car with hair .

But since then Connie has gone from strength to strength performing in front of sell-out crowds to an army of fans across the globe. Now a teenager, she is preparing to tour Asia again in the summer in front of thousands in South Korea, Malaysia and China. She has attracted over a billion views on her YouTube channel - which boasts more than 600,000 subscribers. That's more than X Factor winners Leona Lewis and Joe McElderry. Connie lives with her family and attends a local school, only performing during Christmas, Easter and summer holidays.

Today Sharon, a full-time mother, said: 'She's come a long way - she's a teenage girl now but she's remained so grounded. 'She can now play the piano and play the guitar and her dedication has paid off - she is massive in Asia, we just cannot believe it. 'Her school life is still important and she is doing really well and we only perform in holiday times and she's never been in such demand. 'She's a megastar in Asia but over half of her YouTube views, which are well over a billion now, come from the US. Connie first melted the hearts of the nation as a gap-toothed six-year-old in 2007 . Connie wowed judges Simon Cowell and Amanda Holden, who were very impressed with her . 'Maybe that's what is next for her - you just never know she might crack America. I'm so proud of her. 'Hopefully . Simon Cowell realises now he perhaps shouldn't have let her go but . we're not bitter, it was probably the right decision at the time. 'We are very thankful and amazed how far she has made it just by herself and we want her to keep her feet on the ground . 'She is turning into a teenager but doesn't really show an interest in boys yet, well not that she's telling me anyway.' Connie has more than 158,000 Twitter followers and most recently played to sell-out crowds in South Korea.

Connie, who has a brother Joshua, 20, and a sister Mollie, 19, said: 'Hopefully in the future I will be doing my own songs and I'm practising my instruments all the time. 'My friends at school are just normal, they treat me the same as everyone else, I don't really know if I'm famous or not. 'I think it [what happened with Simon Cowell] was the right choice, I was too young to do a lot of stuff at that time. 'I still watch Britain's Got Talent, I liked Attraction [Hungarian dance group who won last year], I thought they were amazing. 'Their audition made me cry. I think it doesn't matter where you come from as long as you can enjoy it. 'I am going to Asia again in July and December. They do give us lots of nice hotels and look after us so I love going there. 'I hope one day I can be as big a pop star like Taylor Swift or Demi Lovato.' Fans queue for Connie's autograph before her concert at the Blue Square Theatre in Seoul, April 26 .

"By . Amanda Owen . Amanda Owen, 39,  juggles looking after 1,000 sheep with bringing up her SEVEN children and running a 2,000 acre sheep farm . Strangely, the job of 'shepherdess' didn't crop up when I was discussing career options with the teachers at my urban comprehensive. Nor did 'hill farmer/mother/midwife/tractor driver/cook/cream tea maker/drystone wall builder/all-round dogsbody'. So how did a townie like me end up looking after 900 sheep and seven children on one of the most isolated farms in the Yorkshire Dales? I swapped the bright lights for the hills when I was 19 years old. My mother had always hoped I might go for a job with Marks & Spencer in my home town of Huddersfield or, better still, become the next Jerry Hall (I'm 6ft tall). But, inspired by the Yorkshire vet James Herriot, I'd set my heart on working with farm animals. After qualifying as a veterinary nurse I started out as a jobbing farmhand in the Lake District. I didn't earn much, but I loved it. For the first time in my life I remember thinking, 'I've got to where I want to be.' Best of all, my new job introduced me to two of the things I love most in the world: my husband, Clive Owen, and Ravenseat Farm, the most beautiful place on earth and my home for the past 17 years. When I say it's beautiful, I mean it. Yes, it's bleak, it's remote (the nearest hospital is more than two hours away, of which more later) and the wind drives rain into the very fabric of the building. When the electricity and water are off we live like the farmers who built the place centuries ago, carrying water from the river and cooking on a fire. But it's the best place to rear children and animals - I can't imagine living anywhere else. Not that I particularly appreciated its beauty the first time I saw it one murky night in October 1996. I'd been asked by a farmer I was working for in Cumbria to drive the 20 miles or so to Swaledale in Yorkshire to collect a ram from a friend of his. As I pulled up in the farmyard at Ravenseat a barking sheepdog emerged from the darkness, followed by a pool of light from the house and a man's voice. 'Ga an' lie down,' shouted the voice. I assumed the command wasn't for me and, sure enough, the dog slunk away. 'Away in, mi lass, and I'll get t'kettle on,' the man said to me. Amanda lives with her husband Clive and seven children in North Yorkshire . And that was it. There was no great feeling that I'd met my destiny; no instant romantic attraction. And yet I now know it was the defining moment of my life. Clive and I got married in the summer of 2000, four years after we'd first met. I wore a wedding gown in gold shot silk - a white meringue wasn't my style, and anyway, it wouldn't have been practical. As it was, I could take the hoop off my dress and feed the calves between the reception and the party. Nothing stops on a farm - not even for a wedding. We didn't go on our honeymoon for a week. It was shearing time, and that took priority. When the last sheep was clipped we set off for Ireland, stopping off at bed and breakfasts en route. By the time we came home I was pregnant with our first child. I'd hoped to give birth at home - after all, I reasoned, I delivered calves and lambs, how difficult could it be? I soon found out when I had to be rushed to hospital 60 miles away for an emergency Caesarean. Although we didn't know it then, it was the shape of things to come. Because it takes an ambulance an hour to get to us, three of our seven children were born in laybys and another at an Army garrison between our farm and the hospital. Amanda was inspired to work on a farm by Yorkshire vet, James Herriot . It was an unconventional start for them, and I suppose their lives have continued that way. I don't take my children to playgrounds or the swimming baths, but they have a great outdoor life and, I hope, an idyllic upbringing in other ways. They eat properly, rarely watch TV and have lots of freedom. For a while their favourite activity before the taxi to school arrived was pig riding - seeing how long they could stay on the back of a cavorting pig was, for a little while, a seriously competitive business. The Tamworth two, as we called the pigs we had at the time, took it all in good sport and seemed to relish flinging them off into the mud. I was relieved, though, when the pigs became part of breakfast itself, instead of a breakfast-time challenge. A day out for me is unusual, but sometimes I have to go. Once, when Clive knew I had to have a scan at hospital, he said, 'You wouldn't tek some sheep to Arthur's field, would yer?' Being an idiot, I said yes. So there I was, trying to park a long-wheelbase Land Rover with a triple-axle trailer on the back and 45 sheep in it, in a hospital car park. I did three circuits, couldn't find anywhere to put it, so pulled into an ambulance bay. I was sure I'd get clamped, but clearly everybody who saw it thought there must have been a terrible agricultural emergency. Why else would anyone park a trailer-load of bleating sheep in a hospital car park? Nobody said it would be an easy life, but I love that we're filling Ravenseat with people. We have the children, we have guests staying in our shepherd's hut and walkers stopping for a break in the sunshine to eat the cream teas I offer in the summer. During the shooting season we see parties come up through the farmyards and out on to the moor, a real cross-section of people from beaters to the well-heeled set: Elle Macpherson looking splendid in tweed, and one time even Prince Charles. And then there are the James Herriot tourists - we once had a delightful Japanese couple intent on seeing a ewe giving birth. Luckily, one of the ewes showed signs that a lamb was imminent, and out came our visitors' video cameras. Then the unusual noises began: agonised groans from the sheep coupled with an eye-popping strained expression. I was beginning to feel uncomfortable, but my visitors thought everything was normal and kept filming. Alerted by the dreadful noise, my husband came rushing in. 'Just keep smilin',' he whispered. 'I 'aven't a clue what the problem is.' We knelt down and realised two lambs were coming at the same time, jammed like a cork in a bottle. 'Turn t'owd girl around, away from t'camera,' hissed Clive. 'We're not guaranteed to 'ave a happy ending.' But to a round of applause from our visitors, two healthy lambs were born and the couple said it was one of the most amazing things they'd seen. For me, it was just one of the daily miracles in my unpredictable but endlessly rewarding life as a Yorkshire shepherdess. Even after all these years, I find myself catching my breath at the splendour of it all. I have a lot to thank James Herriot for. The Yorkshire Shepherdess by Amanda Owen (Sidgwick & Jackson, £16.99) is out now.","Amanda Owen swapped the city for the country when she was 19 .

"By . Roger Dobson . Exploding head syndrome may sound like a made-up condition - in fact, it's a real . and frightening medical disorder, and one that a study suggests is . surprisingly common. People with exploding head syndrome (EHS) hear loud noises when going to sleep or on waking up. The . type of noise can vary from explosions and fireworks to slammed doors, . the sound of a gun firing, an enormous roar, shouting, thunder or a . crack of lightning. The noises start suddenly and last for a few . seconds. Before hearing the loud noise, one in ten also has visual . disturbances, such as seeing lightning or flashes. These are similar to . the auras some people have before a migraine headache. People with exploding head syndrome (EHS) hear loud noises when going to sleep or on waking up . 'In contrast . to migraine, visual symptoms are brief - typically a single flash,' says . Dr Nicholas Silver, a consultant neurologist at the Walton Centre NHS . Foundation, Liverpool. Exploding head syndrome may also cause a mild . headache and sensations of heat; other symptoms include a jerk or . 'jumping' limbs at the same time. While some have only one attack in . their life, others experience up to seven a night. They may come and go . over weeks or months, though for some they occur almost daily for . years. It can lead to sleeping problems and worse: an attack may . cause temporary tachycardia - a faster heart rate than normal - and . palpitations. In the longer term it can also lead to panic disorder, . depression and catastrophising, where patients misinterpret symptoms as . signs of more serious conditions, such as a stroke. 'I have . assessed patients reporting apprehension who avoid sleep during chronic . bouts of EHS,' says Dr Brian Sharpless, an assistant professor  of . psychology at Washington  State University. 'It can be very frightening . and scary for those who do not know what is happening.' It can lead to sleeping problems and worse: an attack may cause temporary tachycardia . And a study . published in the journal Sleep Medicine Reviews suggests that the . disorder may affect as many as one in ten people at some time during . their life. 'It has been claimed that EHS is rare, but preliminary . data does not appear to imply rarity,' says Dr Sharpless, who led the . study. The disorder is known to be twice as common in women and . typically affects the over-50s, though it has also been reported in . children as young as ten. Quite why it occurs is not clear. One . theory is that it is caused by ear problems, especially those affecting . the eustachian tube, which links the middle ear with the back of the . nose and throat. Problems here can affect air pressure in the middle ear, which can cause the perception of sounds when there are none. Exploding . head syndrome is also linked to rapid withdrawal from certain drugs . such as benzodiazepines, given for anxiety or sleeping problems, or . anti-depressants called selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors. However, . Dr Sharpless says the most likely explanation  is that there is some . kind of temporary blip in the nerve cells of the brain during the switch . from being awake to sleeping. When we go to sleep, the brain . orchestrates a switching off of various regions responsible for . movement, vision, sound and so on. It's thought that EHS occurs because . of a delay in this shut-down, resulting in a burst of activity - this is . perceived as loud noises and flashes of light. Yet even though it was identified 150 years ago, researchers say EHS remains little known. 'It . is an entirely benign and non-threatening condition,' says Dr Silver. However, lack of awareness means it's often misdiagnosed, as . 'night-time' epilepsy, thunder-clap headaches - sudden, severe pain that . peaks within 60 seconds - or nightmare disorder, where people often . wake with detailed recall of frightening dreams. It is also . misdiagnosed as migraine, cluster headaches - severe pain on one side, . often behind the eye - and post-traumatic stress disorder flashbacks. 'Because . a diagnosis of EHS does not occur to a lot of doctors, it is not . uncommon to see patients having investigations to rule out disorders . such as subarachnoid haemorrhage (sudden bleeding around the brain) or . epilepsy,' says Dr Silver. Patients may be given scans  or even a . lumbar puncture - where a needle is used to remove spinal fluid to check . for subarachnoid haemorrhage. 'My main concern is the lack of . recognition of this disorder among the public, but also possibly among . the medical profession  as it does not feature highly in standard . textbooks on medicine or neurology,' says Dr Silver. He stresses the . importance of educating doctors who have not come across EHS - 'so . patients with this syndrome are not put through probable unnecessary . scans or lumbar punctures'. 'As with most neurological conditions, . diagnosis relies on taking a good history from the patient and excluding . more worrisome possibilities.' For without a diagnosis, people with EHS will also miss out on receiving proper treatment. The good news, says Dr Sharpless, is that while EHS can be scary, it is generally harmless. 'Any . problems tend to be because of the way people react to episodes, such . as misinterpreting them as indicative of  a more serious condition, or . avoiding sleep.' Most patients simply require reassurance. 'I find . lifestyle advice, for instance avoiding caffeine before bed, is all they . need,' says Dr Silver. There are drug treatments that may be . effective, including the antidepressant clomipramine, calcium . channel-blockers and anticonvulsants - typically used for epilepsy - . though it's not clear how these work. 'Drug treatment is reserved for those with frequent symptoms,' says Dr Silver.","People with EHS hear loud noises when going to sleep or on waking .

"By . Lisa Buckingham . Fatima . Ahmed always ensured that her daughter had not one, but two asthma . inhalers at primary school. Saarah was diagnosed with severe asthma at . just three months old, and her mother knew how quickly her attacks could . escalate, and that she needed her inhaler within seconds. When . Saarah was 11, she had an asthma attack just as the school day was . finishing. Fatima wasn't worried, as she knew she'd immediately be able . to get one of inhalers - one was kept in reception, and the other in her . daughter's classroom. 'I . came to pick Saarah up from school and knew straight away that she was . at the beginning of an attack,' recalls Fatima, 36, a full-time mother, . who lives with her husband Parvez, 41, a shop manager, Saarah, now 13, . and son Deen, ten, in London. Fatima Ahmed (L) and daughter Saarah, 13, (R) who had an asthma attack at school . 'She was pale and blotchy, and I could hear her wheezing. She'd been too shy to say anything to her teacher.' What . Saarah needed was her reliever inhaler - these usually come in a blue . container and contain salbutamol, which quickly relaxes the muscles . surrounding the narrowed airways to make breathing easier (this is . different from preventer inhalers, taken daily, which contain low-dose . steroids to build up protection by reducing long-term inflammation in . the airways). Fatima . asked for the inhaler kept at reception. But renovation works meant the . inhaler had been locked in a cupboard for safekeeping. The deputy head . had a key, but she'd gone home. Saarah's . wheezing was getting worse. Fatima asked the receptionist to fetch the . second inhaler from her classroom. Thirty minutes later, he returned and . said it was nowhere to be found. By . this point, someone had alerted the deputy head, who'd returned to . school to unlock the cupboard and get the other inhaler, but Saarah was . now struggling to breathe. 'I always remain outwardly very calm as it keeps Saarah calm, but inside I felt a rising panic,' says Fatima. 'Her . wheezing had become severe and I knew she needed to get to hospital . because it's happened many times before. It's five minutes away, so I . drove her there. She was treated in A&E and then transferred to . intensive care, where she had asthma drugs through an intravenous line.' Saarah's inhalers weren't accessible . She . adds that Saarah spent the next four days in hospital. She went . straight back to school when she came out, but had to take it easy and . her dose of oral steroids was temporarily increased. It's . a common story, says the charity Asthma UK. A child has an asthma . attack at school and needs their inhaler, but for some reason it's not . accessible. Secondary school children can carry their own inhalers, but even that doesn't guarantee access. 'A . worrying 86 per cent of children say they have been without their own . inhaler because they have forgotten, lost, broken or run out of it,' says Kay Boycott, the charity's chief executive. The . ideal solution would be for schools to hold a spare emergency inhaler . in their first-aid kits, but it's illegal to do so because it's a . prescription-only medication. With . one in 11 UK children having asthma, it's a pressing issue. Asthma UK . has been campaigning since 2011 to get the law changed to allow schools . to hold a spare inhaler. As . Kay Boycott explains: 'The equivalent of a classroom of children die . because of asthma every year. We know it could really make a difference . because more than two-thirds of children with asthma in the UK have had . an attack while at school.' The . school environment has many potential triggers for an asthmatic child, . adds Deborah Waddell, a clinical lead nurse for the charity. These . include exercise during PE lessons or break time, sudden changes in . temperature (going from a warm classroom to a cold playground), . exam/test stress, and wood dust or glues from woodwork lessons. Prescription-only medication can only be administered to a named person, . which has prevented schools from carrying a spare - as the drugs . watchdog, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency points . out, this also applies to adrenaline injections known as EpiPens, which . are administered during severe allergic reactions. Asthma . UK wants an exemption to this rule for schools, allowing them to . administer an inhaler to any child registered as asthmatic who has a . parental consent form signed in advance. 'Reliever . inhalers have a standard dosage and there would be clear guidance about . when and how the spare inhaler should be used,' explains Deborah . Waddell. 'There . is no danger, however, if an inhaler is used unnecessarily - the worst . that can happen is some shakiness and an increased heart rate, but this . soon passes and causes no harm.' Fourteen-year-old Alex Birch, from . Harrogate, N. Yorks, carries his inhaler with him, as he needs to use it . at least three times a week, especially during winter and the pollen . season, as the cold and pollen are two of his triggers. 'But . one day last year, I left it by the side of the football pitch during . PE and forgot to pick it up after the lesson,' he says. 'I went back to retrieve it as soon as I remembered, but someone had trodden on it and it was in pieces.' That lunchtime, Alex played football with his friends. 'I didn't want to sit inside and be a misery,' he says. 'After . a few minutes, though, I started feeling really breathless and knew it . could lead to an attack. I would usually have had a puff on my inhaler, . but I couldn't, so I stopped straight away and managed to get my . breathing under control by staying calm and taking long, deep breaths. 'It . could have been a lot worse.  I felt so panicky that I didn't have my . inhaler. Having an asthma attack is terrifying - it's like having a plug . in your throat and you can't breathe in - and the thought that I . couldn't access the medicine that can save my life made me really . anxious. 'It's . my responsibility to carry my inhaler now that I'm in secondary school, . but I've misplaced it more than once as I have so many bags and books . to remember. Saarah was treated in A&E and then transferred to intensive care, where she had asthma drugs . 'I . wish that my school was allowed to have an emergency inhaler, and I . think they wish they could, too! I know several people at school who've . been without their inhaler at some point, and once had to lend mine to a . boy who'd left his at home.' A . lack of a spare inhaler in school can have tragic consequences. Eight-year-old Olivia Chandler died after having an asthma attack in . school in October 2010. Her . mother Teresa was called to bring in a spare inhaler, but by the time . she arrived, the school had called an ambulance and Olivia was on the . floor being given CPR by the paramedics. It was too late to save her. 'Things . might have been very different for Olivia if the school had been able . to keep an emergency inhaler on site,' says Teresa, 34, from High . Wycombe. During . an asthma attack, two main things happen, explains Dr Andrew . Menzies-Gow, consultant in respiratory medicine at Royal Brompton . Hospital, London. 'The . airways become inflamed and can become clogged with extra mucus, and . the muscles of the airways spasm, causing them to narrow. If left . untreated, this can lead to the airways becoming completely blocked, . causing a fatal attack. 'A . reliever inhaler can have an instant effect and prevent the attack from . progressing to status asthmaticus, a stage where the airways becomes . unresponsive to the reliever inhaler and the person needs hospital . intervention.' Every . second counts once a child starts having an attack, adds Deborah . Waddell. 'The school could call an ambulance, but that takes time and . could be prevented if the child has guaranteed access to an inhaler at . all times.' The . good news is that the Government is expected to announce a consultation . on the issue soon, which could lead to a change in the law. This could . happen as soon as October, in time for the winter cough and cold season - . a trigger for many asthmatics. For . the Chandler family this is welcome news. Olivia's sister, Nicole, . five, also has asthma - 'she understands what happened to her sister,' says her father Darren. 'She . has an inhaler in her classroom, but I would feel much more at ease if I . knew there was also a spare inhaler on site in case of emergencies. If . this campaign can save just one child's life, it will have been a huge . success.' Asthma . UK would like anyone with experience of being without an inhaler in . school to tell their story during the government consultation.

'There are over 650 muscles in the human body with roughly 50 concentrated in the face, it takes approximately 43 to frown, 17 to smile, but without proper stimulation, face muscles are prone to sagging. 'Face Gym . goes beyond the skin - our face trainers work deep into the muscles . around key problem areas such as jowls, eyes and foreheads.' The . signature £35 30 minute treatment consists of a warm up, cardio, . and cool down with £15 (10 minute) add-ons available o target specific . treatment areas. Inge . uses techniques she learnt from her sessions at celebrity favourite . Barry's Bootcamp and the Skinny B***h Collective, which focus on . interval training to make your muscles lengthen. Inge and her team use facial flicking, pummeling and fast finger movements to lift the cheeks, drain excess fluid from under the eyes and work on fine lines. She refuses to call it a . 'facial', maintaining that it is more about 'sets, reps and packs'. The session promises to deliver results immediately, but Inge recommends . going once a week for very visible results. If you're looking to take . the workout to the next level, Inge and her team offer 'mouth work', a . 20 minute in-mouth massage, which promises to relieve tension and widen . the mouth palette.

Inge is the first person to bring this concept to the beauty market, . face massage has been practiced in ancient cultures for centuries and . was once the secret of Chinese Empresses practiced 3,000 years ago to . increase circulation of blood and 'chi' to the face.

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . Botox injections are being tested to see if the drug can help men who suffer from premature ejaculation. Researchers at Tulane University in New Orleans injected male rats with the drug to see if it made any impact on how long they lasted during intercourse. The length of intercourse was then compared to their pre-injection performance. Scientists injected rats with Botox to see if it would help them last longer during intercourse. After finding it increased how long the animals lasted, the drug's manufacturer is now running trials on 60 male volunteers across the country (library image) Researchers found the rats lasted much longer after they were injected with the drug - which is made from one of the world's deadliest toxins Botulinum. The data was then published in the latest Journal of Sexual Medicine. Now a two-year trial on 60 human volunteers is being rolled out across the country to see if Botox could help those suffering from premature ejaculation. Men between 18 and 50 who are currently in long-term monogamous relationships are eligible for the trial - which is being conducted in both London and Belfast by the drug's manufacturer Allergan. A selection of the volunteers will have the drug injected in to a muscle at the end of their genitalia - while others will receive a placebo. Dr John Dean, the former president of the International Society for Sexual Medicine, said the trials were 'worth investigating'. However, he warned the drug must be administered by medics who were familiar with the drug. The doctor added the treatment may have to be repeated once the drug wears off. Botox, which is made from one of the world's deadliest toxins, is commonly used to smooth wrinkles in the face as is also used to treat severe migraines (library image) Around one in four men suffer from premature ejaculation - and it is the most common sexual problem among young men. According to the NHS Choices website, a man who regularly ejaculates within one minute would be regarded as having a medical problem that requires treatment. Comparatively, a study of 500 couples from five different countries found the average length of intercourse was five-and-a-half minutes, the site says. A number of things are thought to contribute to premature ejaculation. They include stress,    relationship problems, anxiety, previous traumatic sexual experiences and depression. Some methods of treating the condition include taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) - which are a type of antidepressant which can help delay climax. Others find couples therapy can help. Botulinum is a lethal toxin which can kill if injected or inhaled. It can cause botulism - a serious and life-threatening illness in humans and animals. Botox is often used to smooth wrinkles and lines - particularly on the face. In 2012, the NHS announced it was to use Botox to treat chronic migraines. The move was based on guidance from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), which recommend it could be used to treat people who have chronic migraines. They said the treatment must only be used on people who have headaches on at least 15 days of every month - eight of which must be migraines. They must also have tried three prior preventative drug treatments.","Scientists at Tulane University, New Orleans, tested Botox injections on rats .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A firm that processes raw placentas for new mothers to eat is facing closure over health fears in a landmark case. The Independent Placenta Encapsulation Network makes capsules and smoothies for mums that it claims have numerous health benefits. But it has been blocked from trading by a local authority over concerns bacteria within the placenta poses a hazard to a ‘significant proportion’ of women. Placentophagy - the act of eating a placenta - has become trendy recently with some people choosing to drink theirs as a smoothie, pictured . A legal case, understood to be the first of its kind, has been heard by a district judge who has reserved judgement. During the hearing, IPEN argued the law shouldn’t be used to govern people who are ‘eating a product of themselves’. Placentophagy - the act of eating the placenta - occurs in the animal kingdom and has become trendy in some circles in recent years. Advocates include Mad Men star January Jones and Kim Kardashian also considered trying it. Some others have been known to eat their placentas in a wrap, pictured . Television chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall controversially fried a placenta with garlic and shallots to make pate for a Channel 4 programme 14 years ago. Benefits are said to include boosting milk production, iron levels and reducing the chances of post-natal depression. But experts say there is only anecdotal evidence for positive effects. IPEN, which is based in Hertfordshire, was founded in 2010 by American Lynnea Shrief after she struggled to produce enough milk for her baby. Dacorum Borough Council issued an Emergency Prohibition Notice in October to halt trading and this has been challenged by IPEN in a court case in Watford, Hertfordshire. Barrister Nicholas George, representing the council, said the bacteria staphylococcus aureus, which is found in the vagina of one in ten women, could be passed onto the placenta. The risk it therefore posed to many women was beyond the control of IPEN, which relies on the mother or her partner to look after the organ before it is handed over for processing. But Bradley Say, representing the firm, said the placenta should be cooled to 8C within four hours of birth and the company always requested a history for each organ before accepting it. IPEN’s duty was to issue good advice and trust the consumer to look after their own health, he added, and there was no record of customers reporting ill-effects. ‘The law does not need to step in and protect people when what they are eating is a product of themselves,’ he said. IPEN’s website says it operates a network of ‘placenta specialists’ who are trained during an ‘intensive’ one-day course. Celebrity chef Hugh Fearnley-Wittingstall once cooked a placenta while filming his Channel 4 show . They also complete two online courses - a level 2 City and Guilds in Food Hygiene for Manufacturers and ‘UK Blood-born (sic) Pathogens-Infection Control’. IPEN failed to respond to a request to comment yesterday. But Mrs Shrief, a holistic therapist from Detroit, Michigan who now lives in Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, with husband Saher, was quoted recently saying how business had taken off. ‘Just two years ago we had 30 specialists on our books. Today we have 102,’ she said. Brighton was a hotspot for the £150 service, she added, with one midwife claiming around one in eight mothers take their placentas home. A council spokeswoman said there hadn’t been a similar legal case anywhere in Europe. She added: ‘We don’t take people to court willy-nilly. We try to work with them beforehand - court is a last resort.’ District Judge Annabel Pilling, who heard the case last month, is expected to hand down her judgement next week.","Eating placentas - placentophagy- has become trendy among some circles .

"By . Nilufer Atik . For most of her life, Hannah Christmas had been labelled mentally ill. Dogged by crippling depression and memory lapses, and at times unable to read or write properly because it felt as if her brain was ‘slowing down’, doctors told her she had a severe mood disorder. Over more than a decade, the  35-year-old solicitor was given countless drugs to ‘cure’ her, from antidepressants and sedatives to  the mood stabiliser lithium – usually given for mania. But nothing touched the ‘unbearable fog’ that left her unable to work full-time. For, in fact, there was a simple  but overlooked cause. Hannah has the little-known – but surprisingly prevalent – Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder, an extreme form  of PMT brought on by a hormonal imbalance. Raising awareness: Hannah Christmas, 35, from Bermondsey in South London, suffers from Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder, an extreme form of PMT . Unlike PMT’s more physical symptoms – headaches, bloating and abdominal, breast and back pain – PMDD causes dominant emotional symptoms as well. Period pain  can be extreme and coupled with nausea and panic attacks. Sufferers also experience suicidal thoughts, frequent crying, anger, feelings of being out of control and trouble thinking. Symptoms typically occur in the week before a period, then go away once it starts, and are thought to be due to an increased sensitivity to the natural changes in hormone levels. And while PMDD affects  up to five per cent of women,  many GPs have never heard of it  – meaning that hundreds of women  are misdiagnosed with psychological disorders. ‘Women with PMDD often describe having a Jekyll and Hyde personality,’ explains Professor John Studd, a world-renowned expert on PMS. Hidden condition: Hannah's hormonal disorder went undiagnosed for 20 years and doctors thought is was psychological, giving her drugs to treat mental illness . He set up the first-ever specialist unit at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in West London and now runs a private practice. ‘About ten days before their period starts, they have this total change of personality. It can be very destructive, particularly to personal relationships. People might tell them to pull themselves together, but they can’t. ‘I have seen so many women misdiagnosed as having psychiatric disorders. But PMDD is cyclical and once menstruation occurs, symptoms subside. This is how we know it is an endocrinological [hormonal] disorder, not psychiatric.’ Hannah’s symptoms started when she was 14. ‘My moods got worse  as the years passed,’ she says. ‘I couldn’t have a proper social life or relationship because for half of the year I couldn’t function properly.’ At university, she would hide away in bed when suicidal feelings struck, unable to face going out. Her moods ruined any chance of a relationship as the men she met couldn’t cope. ‘Some days I would just lie in bed sobbing. It was so difficult to study when the depression struck as it would take me several minutes to make sense of one paragraph,’ says Hannah, from Bermondsey in South London. ‘My cognitive function was so badly impaired.’ Struggle: Hannah's PDD symptoms started when she was 14 and got progressively worse . Hannah began suffering insomnia and night sweats in her 20s, so severe she left her job at a City law firm. ‘For two weeks of every month I’d be absolutely fine. Then for the next . two weeks I’d descend into this mental hell. 'I had a feeling my illness . wasn’t what the doctors thought and asked why I was well for half of . each month. They would just shrug.’ Hannah struggled on for over 20 years, seeing a series of doctors and psychiatrists who consistently failed to diagnose the right problem. One psychiatrist even suggested . controversial electro-convulsive therapy, usually the last line of . intervention for schizophrenia and catatonia. ‘It terrified me,’ Hannah recalls. ‘I really didn’t want to do it but I . had reached the end of the road in terms of treatment so I considered . it. I just wanted to get better.’ Then last September one of her . colleagues suggested her symptoms might be due to hormones, and . something clicked. ‘She told me about PMDD. I’d never heard of it but . when I looked it up, it made sense.’ Hannah’s . research led her to Professor Studd at The London  PMS and Menopause . Clinic. He has conducted extensive studies into  the effects of hormone . therapy on PMDD, in particular the use of the female hormone oestrogen. He . discovered that in 94 per cent of cases, oestrogen either dramatically . reduced symptoms or eliminated them. It was a huge breakthrough. He also . discovered that not only are women with PMDD intolerant of the hormone . progesterone – previously used to treat PMT through the contraceptive . pill – it actually makes symptoms worse. Lack of exercise, stress and eating a poor diet also aggravate symptoms. So does delaying motherhood. ‘Anything that halts or interferes with the menstrual cycle, like pregnancy, can stop PMDD,’ explains Prof Studd. ‘But more and more women are putting off having children, which doesn’t help. 'As women get closer to menopause, levels of oestrogen drop, which means symptoms can get worse. The only answer is to have a baby or a hysterectomy. For women who want children later, the only other option is hormone treatment.’ Sadly, some of Prof Studd’s patients have been so desperate that they have sacrificed motherhood. Thanks to Prof Studd, Hannah began hormone treatment – a combination of an oestrogen implant, and a coil which administers small doses of progesterone. She says:  ‘At last I can reclaim my life. I have stopped taking lithium. I should never have been on it. It does make me feel angry that there are women like me being given unnecessary drugs and being told they have mental illnesses they don’t have. There needs to be a lot more awareness about this condition.’","Hannah Christmas, 35, had PDD, but doctors gave her drugs for mania .

"By . Lizzie Parry . When his kidneys began to fail at the age of 25, Andy Knox faced a lifetime hooked up to a dialysis machine. He was put on to the transplant list but warned he would have to undergo dialysis for six months before he was deemed eligible for a new organ. In those six months if he received no treatment at all M,r Knox was warned his renal failure would claim his life. Determined not to watch their son deteriorate in front of their eyes, the now 42-year-old's parents Freddie and Teresa, stepped in. Andy Knox (bottom left) is believed to be among a handful of people in the world to have received three kidney transplants from his mother Teresa (bottom right), father Freddie (top right) and sister Helen (top left) They put themselves forward to be tested to see if they were a match - and remarkably, both parents were told they could save their son. It was Mrs Knox, 63, who insisted on joining her son in the operating theatre, donating her kidney, in what appeared to be a successful transplant operation. But after more than 50 hospital visits in the next eight years, the organ began to fail. In 2006 Mr Knox returned to the Royal Liverpool University Hospital for transplant number two. This time it was his father, Freddie, 67, who stepped in to help, donating one of his kidneys. Again the success of the transplant operation was short-lived, when last year - seven years after receiving his father's kidney - Mr Knox faced another failing organ. He was forced to go back on dialysis and appeared to be running out of options when his sister Helen, 33, said she wanted to help. The nursery manager underwent the relevant tests, which revealed she was a 100 per cent match. Two weeks ago the siblings were admitted to the Royal Liverpool where surgeons carried out Mr Knox's third transplant. The father-of-one today said he feels 'rejuvenated' and is looking forward to getting his life back on track after years of uncertainty and treatment. Mr Knox, whose son Bailey is 15, said: 'In the space of two weeks I had gone from being on top of the world to being told I may only have six months to live. The 42-year-old's first operation took place at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital in 1998 when he was 25 years old. Eight years later he had the second procedure, when father Freddie donated one of his kidneys . 'Without a matching donor I faced life on dialysis. But I was extremely fortunate because mum and dad had tests and were both matches for me. 'You have to take a lot of drugs to stop your body rejecting the kidney but they suppress your immune system, which leaves you at risk of infection. 'It is a fine balancing act, and I was just unlucky. The air smells cleaner and food tastes good again. 'I have a real feeling of rejuvenation and it feels like I've been given four lives. 'Mum, dad and Helen have all put their own lives at risk to make my life more comfortable and I will be forever grateful for that. 'Mum, dad and Helen have all put their own lives at risk to make my life more comfortable and I will be forever grateful for that' - Transplant patient Andy Knox . 'They can see that I am not taking it for granted by keeping myself fit and active. Some people can be dialysis for 10 or 20 years and never get a donor. 'Some eventually get one from a stranger, which is great for them but the added benefit I have is that I can thank my mum, dad and Helen every day.' After his first transplant, Mr Knox took up a voluntary committee management role for Transplant Sport UK. He won two silver medals at the World Transplant Games in Australia where he was captain of the UK's tennis team. He has also won medals at the Games in Thailand in 2007, Australia 2009 and Sweden 2011. Mr Knox said: 'The games are a way for people like me to show everyone that since having a transplant, we have not just sat at home and rested on our laurels. 'It shows that we want to make the most of what we've been given. Two weeks ago Mr Knox and his sister Helen (pictured) underwent his third transplant. He said he feels 'rejuvenated', and thanked his family for stepping in when he needed their help . 'My son Bailey was born a year after my first transplant so he's grown up knowing that I need a lot of treatment. 'He's still in school but he's a bright lad and just like the rest of my family he's very supportive. 'People I've met have said it's quite uncommon for people to have that many transplants at all, let alone all from their own family. 'The odds would have been incredible. 'Everyone we spoke to at the hospital said it was very rare to have three kidneys donated all from family members. 'It really does feel like I've had a new lease of life again, not for the first time, so I'm massively grateful to my family and all of the medical staff who have helped me.' Abdul Hammad, a consultant transplant surgeon at the hospital, said: 'We have seen many cases where a person has two or even three transplants. 'But Andrew is the first we have treated who has been fortunate enough to find three matches in his own family. 'It is wonderful they were able to help him in this way.'","Andy Knox went into renal failure when he was 25 years old .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A transgender woman has told of her joy after internet users paid for her to have a vagina. Samantha Allen said she is used to receiving abuse online, so could not believe it when she raised the $8,000 needed for her surgery in less than 24 hours. Ms Allen, a doctoral fellow in the Department of Women’s, Gender and Sexuality Studies at Emory University, in Atlanta, raised the money through crowdfunding. A transgender woman has had surgery to create a vagina after raising $8,000 on a crowdfunding website. Samantha Allen (right, pictured with her wife, Corey) had the operation in April . On The Daily Dot she wrote: ‘I’ve been called every anti-woman, anti-gay, and anti-transgender slur in the dictionary. ‘I’ve read three thousand word e-mails from anonymous readers who just want to let me know that I’m a disgrace to my community. ‘So if you had told me last year that I would one day be tearfully thanking the internet for supporting my gender transition, I would have laughed in your face.’ Ms Allen, who was born a man, wanted to have surgery to remove her penis and replace it with a vagina. She discovered that the operation would cost about $20,000. Her health insurance would cover part of the cost but she would need to pay the remaining $8,000. Samantha Allen says she could not believe it when she reached the fundraising target in less than 24 hours. Image shows her fundraising page . Unable to afford this herself, she and her wife, Corey Burke, created an IndieGoGo crowdfunding campaign to pay for the gender reassignment surgery. She explained that she saw having a penis as ‘a source of suffocating shame and self-loathing’ meaning she knew she had to have the surgery. On her IndieGoGo page she added that she has been taking female hormones since November 2012 and that she has 'spent [her] entire life trying to correct the circumstances of [her] birth. She wrote . that she was born into a devout Mormon family and that when she left the . Mormon church she was told by her father that her decision would have . 'eternal consequences'. She took this to mean that he thought she would go to hell. Ms Allen says that since the operation she now loves her body for the first time (file picture) She went on to explain that she did not believe she would raise all of the money through crowdfunding but that she hoped it might make a dent in the total. However, she couldn’t believe her eyes when she found that every time she refreshed the page the amount raised had increased by $500. She says by the end of the first day, she had received almost $5,000 in donations and that she reached the target the next day. She added it took her a little while to realise that her life was about to change forever thanks to the generosity of strangers. Then, on April 23 this year she underwent surgery, explaining surgery isn't as complex as one might think - it simply involves ‘rearranging’ the tissue that's already there. She explained that during the operation, the surgeon used the existing tissue to create the vagina as well as a clitoris. Upon waking from surgery, the first thing she did was Tweet: ‘I have a vagina’, as she felt she should let the people who paid for it know. And that after the operation, she felt a profound sense of calm wash over her and unlike anything else she had experience - for the first time in her life, she felt beautiful and loved her whole body. She will now have to use a sex toy to maintain the shape of her new vagina until it has healed. But, she concludes, the internet has now changed her life for the better.","Samantha Allen was born a man and wanted surgery to create a vagina .

"By . Mark Duell . A school in Britain has become the first in Europe to teach pupils while they are standing up, it was revealed today. Nine and ten-year-old pupils at Grove House Primary School in Bradford, West Yorkshire, are taking part in a pilot - run by local medical researchers in a bid to improve concentration and health. The seven-week scheme will see pupils take it in turn to stand behind six desks while the others sit down as usual, with each student spending a carefully-calculated 230 minutes standing each week. Scroll down for video . Pilot: Aleefa, ten, is one of the pupils at Grove House Primary School in Bradford using a standing desk . The trial is designed to assess the impact on concentration of sitting for long periods of time - and what effects it can have on children’s health. Schools in Australia, New Zealand and the US have already tried the idea, but the Year Five children at Grove House Primary are thought to be the first in Europe to use the innovative desks. Teacher Hannah Rogers, 28, said: ‘The pupils have been so excited to take part in this experiment, and they absolutely love it. ‘We’ve only been doing it two weeks in my class and already I can see an improvement. I’ve got a very active class and I think they’re really responding to having more freedom. Test: The pupils' weight, height, blood pressure, waist circumference and fine motor skills are being taken during the experiment, and the results will be compared at the end . Standing up: Aleefa (left) and ten-year-old Raheem (right) are involved in the seven-week scheme which will see pupils take it in turn to stand behind six desks while the others sit down as usual . ‘It keeps them focused. They’re . working better, their concentration is better, and when given the . option, they want to continue standing rather than going back to . sitting. The year group of 55 pupils whose parents gave permission for them to take part in the trial was divided into two. The first half used the standing desks for seven weeks from February to the Easter half term, while the second half started using the desks after Easter for another seven weeks. During the experiment, pupils are being monitored in two ways. One is with an actigraph accelerator - a red box worn on the waist like a pedometer to monitor how much physical activity is carried out. They are also examined with an actipal activity monitor - a small patch stuck to the thigh, which measures whether the pupils is standing or sitting. Their weight, height, blood pressure, waist circumference and fine motor skills are also being taken, and the results will be compared at the end of the study. ‘It doesn’t seem to . be limited to certain lessons, as it seems to be working for everything . - maths, English, even using a laptop. ‘And . I’m glad that the excitement of the experiment has shown them that . scientists aren’t boring or stuffy - science can be fun, like this.’ Dr Sally Barber, principal research fellow at medical researchers Born in Bradford, said: ‘The idea is two-fold. Firstly, we want to see whether we can change pupils’ behaviour. ‘We know if you can establish healthy lifestyles early in life, they can be continued into adulthood. ‘So a less sedentary lifestyle while . you’re a child means less sedentary adults. There have also been studies . which show that conditions like diabetes are affected by sitting for . long periods of time. ‘Secondly, . sitting for a long period of time has been shown to have a negative . impact on children in terms of concentration and behaviour. We want to . see if this study will change that. ‘ . Born . in Bradford is a social study looking at a number of babies born in the . city after 2007, and is now working with Loughborough University on the . standing learning project. Trailblazers: Schools in Australia, New Zealand and the US have already tried the idea, but Grove House Primary is thought to be the first in Europe to use the innovative desks . Dr Barber said that the idea came from a school in Australia, which has now secured funding to roll out the trial over a number of schools in the country - proving its ‘feasibility’. She added: ‘The idea is used in a school . in Australia, New Zealand and one in Texas, America - but as far as we . know it’s not been done anywhere else in Europe.’ 'I'm glad that the excitement of the experiment has shown [the pupils] that scientists aren't boring or stuffy - science can be fun, like this' Hannah Rogers, teacher . The desks, which can be raised and lowered with a handle, have been donated by a company called Ergotron. Dr Barber, who is working with four others on the study, said the hoped to have results of this first study by mid-September. Grove House Primary School was opened in 1969 and has around 420 children in its main school as well as 52 in the nursery. But its latest Ofsted inspection in November 2013 concluded that it was 'a school that requires improvement'. The report said there was an 'inconsistent' quality of teaching, governors were 'not holding leaders to account' and white British pupils were 'not doing as well as similar pupils across the country'.","Nine and ten-year-old pupils taking part in pilot at a school in Bradford .

"By . Lizzie Parry . When his parents divorced, they turned to him for emotional support. But struggling to find his own coping mechanism, Christoffer Hecksen turned to comfort eating. His weight spiralled quickly, reaching 22 stone 13lbs. But it wasn't until a decade later in 2006, that reality hit the now 33-year-old. When he broke his arm, Mr Hecksen was told by his doctor that he might struggle to fix his injured shoulder because of his size. When Christoffer Hecksen's parents divorced they turned to the then 16-year-old for support. But struggling to cope with the ordeal, the teenager turned to comfort eating . His weight spiraled and by 2006, 10 years after his parents' divorce, he weighed 22 stone 13lbs. Shortly after his father's death he fell and broke his shoulder, prompting a doctor to express concern over his size . For two years, Mr Hecksen visited a psychologist once a week, to tackle the emotional side of his eating . The medic asked Mr Hecksen what he would do if he recovered from the procedure, to which he replied: 'I'll join the army', revealing his desire to help others. It was in 1996 that the then teenager's parents broke the news of their separation, he told new weight loss magazine ManVFat. 'They said to me ""You’re almost an adult so we can treat you as an adult."",' Mr Hecksen told MailOnline. 'So they used me to offload to and share their experiences with the divorce. It left me with no one to talk to. 'At that time I was using training as my escape and I was spending four to six hours every day in the gym seven days a week. 'That . had a devastating result on my school work and so my parents took away . the gym pass to punish me - I was left with food as a comfort. 'Between . 1996 to 2002 I gained about seven stone 12lbs.' Mr Hecksen, who defuses mines in the Swedish Army, now weighs a healthy 15 stone . The doctor asked Mr Hecksen what he would do with his body if he carried out the operation and fixed his shoulder. Mr Hecksen's reply was that he would join the army and try to help others . Following the operation to fix his shoulder, Mr Hecksen underwent a programme of exercise rehabilitation. It was the springboard he needed to kick start his fitness regime . For Mr Hecksen, portion size was his Achilles heal. It didn't matter what the food was, he ate it in abundance, having been brought up with the old adage 'you can't leave the table until your plate is empty', ringing in his ears. 'That left me with a big appetite,' he said. 'I could be eating every hour to every second hour. It was very stressful. 'I felt like everyone else around me was getting love from their family and I was too damaged in my mind to have any kind of productive relationship. 'The food was the only thing I could count on to be there' - Christoffer Hecksen . 'The food was the only thing I could count on to be there.' In 2006, Mr Hecksen's father died and he returned home to complete university as fast as possible. But on his first day, as he walked to school, he fell and broke his arm. 'I broke my shoulder and needed an operation, the doctor asked what I would do with my body if he helped to fix me. 'I told the doctor I would join the army,' Mr Hecksen said. 'I thought if I'm going to apply to the army I'd better choose something really ridiculous and crawling up to a live mine is about as ridiculous as it gets. Mr Hecksen, pictured here in 2006 when he was at his heaviest, said he signed up to take part in a series of boot camp sessions to tackle his fitness and weight. He said: 'It made me realise that I may not be the fastest or the strongest but I don't quit' He said: 'The biggest thing for me was learning that I could survive on less food. 'The boot camps taught me what a proper portion looks like' 'I sent an application and it took them two days to get back to me and say, fantastic. I rolled the dice and went to become a solider.' But in order to succeed in the army, Mr Hecksen first had to shed the pounds. 'After surgery you're required to do physical training to regain your mobility,' he said. 'I took that as my springboard to start exercising regularly. And since I was training a lot as a teenager, I remembered that slow and steady wins the race. So I just tried to do something every day.' 'The biggest thing for me was learning that I could survive on less food' - Christoffer Hecksen . In 2009, when he was at his heaviest, Mr Hecksen found the all-male New You Boot Camp online, and signed up. He said: 'It made me realise that I may not be the fastest or the strongest but I don't quit. 'The trainers told me that they had set up guesses on roughly how quick people would break. 'And they said I’d be done in four hours and it actually took me a day and a half. 'By then I was so tired I tried to pick up a single green bean at lunch but I couldn’t move my arm. 'So . I started crying and one of the coaches Jacqui sat with me for an hour . to motivate me to lift my arm and put the food in my mouth. That was my . turning point.' 'The biggest thing for me was learning that I could survive on less food,' he added. Mr Hecksen said while the boot camps began to reap rewards as he watched his weight drop, he soon realised that he had to tackle the root cause of his unhealthy relationship with food . 'The boot camps taught me what a proper portion looks like. I got home and I taught myself to cook properly. 'After that I stuck to . avoiding half-made foods. I had things that I could identify from . animals and farms. I stayed away from anything that had the word 'light' in it.' Gradually Mr Hecksen moved from last place in the boot camp fitness tests to first, boosting his confidence and giving him the incentive to carry on. 'Two years is a very short period of time but you can change so much in that time,' he added. To truly tackle his unhealthy relationship with food, Mr Hecksen recognised he needed to address the root cause of his problem. In 2009 he also started to visit a group for people who had lost close relatives, encouraging him to open up and talk about his emotions. For two years he attended weekly sessions with a psychologist. 'It started out as a trial for me to see . if I could make myself talk about emotions and after a few sessions I . realised it was something I needed to do to save myself,' he revealed. 'We talked about emotions and how in my mind there was a lot of guilt and blame attached to food. 'I would hugely recommend going to a psychologist and getting professional help if you’ve got a similar issue. He said: 'A fresh pair of eyes on the situation is what you need and you need it from a person who doesn¿t know you. Quite simply it helps you to understand why you are eating the way you do' 'A . fresh pair of eyes on the situation is what you need and you need it . from a person who doesn’t know you. Quite simply it helps you to . understand why you are eating the way you do.' Mr Hecksen said it is important that others facing a battle with their weight must realise they are not alone. He said the first step is to start talking and see if you can work out what the core issue is. From there while weight-loss can only be achieved with physical workouts, Mr Hecksen said: 'You need to go through the process of making your mind tougher as well. 'Explore your dark things - if you don't deal with those then you will fail.' Mr Hecksen, now in the Swedish Army, is close to his target weight having shed six stone. Weighing in at 15 stone, he said now he is focusing on 'fine tuning' his body. 'To get the results it's always going to be small variables to change,' he said. 'It's important that people know that weight loss is not a short term goal, it's a way of life, it shouldn't be about reaching a body fat percentage or a weight. 'It should be about living healthily. For me it's about being able to work out, to work, to have fun and appreciate that the emotion of life is joy and not fear.' - Man V Fat is a free digital magazine for men who want to lose weight.

"By . Richard Spillett . Children as young as TEN are being enrolled on a council run weight-loss programme in a bid to get them to shed the pounds, it emerged this week. School children between the ages of 10 and 17 are being signed up to a 12-week 'self help' course to teach them about healthy eating and the importance of exercise. Those involved will take part in cookery classes and physical activities, as well as discussing the underlying reasons for their weight problems. Children as young as 10 are being enrolled on a weight-loss programme aimed at getting them to exercise. File photo . Organisers of the 'Self Help Independence Nutrition and Exercise' (SHINE) course, running in Weston-super-Mare, north Somerset, hope to improve children's self-esteem. Figures show more than one in three 10 to 11-year-olds in the UK is now deemed 'above healthy weight'. Organisers are encouraging parents to admit their child is overweight and sign them up for the course. A spokesperson for the scheme said: 'We'll also be encouraging physical activity and looking at the reasons that they may be a little bit above their expected weight. 'Body image and self esteem will also be something that is looked at over the course of the scheme. 'We are very keen to get the children involved in cookery courses and hopefully that will be something we can do. Organisers are hoping to get kids off their diets of fast food and teach them to cook and eat healthily . 'We are hoping to have 10-12 children on the course but obviously it is difficult to keep the numbers up. 'Many of the children may drop out before the course has finished as it can become quite difficult for them. 'Obviously it's also quite a difficult thing to get the parents to agree to send their children.' A leading health charity has warned that, whilst it is important for children to be educated in healthy eating and exercise, raising the issue could actually have a negative impact on their health. A spokesperson for eating disorder helpline B-eat, said: 'Obviously it's important how the message is conveyed to young people and their parents. 'A healthy balanced diet and regular exercise is key to individuals being fit and active. 'If there are underlying problems driving the weight gain then it's good to know that these would be addressed but hopefully in a way that will not cause a contrary reaction in a young child and lead them to lose an unhealthy amount of weight.' The scheme has previously been run in other areas, including Sheffield and Plymouth.","Primary school children enrolled on course to get them to lose weight .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Researchers studying the skeletons of 14th century Londoners found life expectancy improved following the plague. Illustration by Kitty Shannon pictured . The Black Death may have wiped out millions of people, but it also made the surviving residents of London healthier. Researchers studying the skeletons of 14th century Londoners found life expectancy improved in the generations following the great plague. And this may have been because the disease wiped out the weak and elderly, leaving only the strongest members of the population. Previous studies have shown the Black Death targeted elderly adults and the sick across Europe from around 1347 to 1351. However, not much is known about any substantial changes in the population, such as overall health and mortality, before and after the epidemic. Doctor Sharon DeWitte, of the University of South Carolina, examined whether the deaths of frail people during the Black Death, combined with consequent rising standards of living - particularly in diet - may have resulted in a healthier post-epidemic population in London. Most available information is in historical documentation, such as tax records and post-mortem analysis, but for the new study Dr DeWitte sampled nearly 600 skeletons from several pre and post-plague London cemeteries. She then analysed their age and modelled age estimates, mortality hazards, and birth rate data for the samples. The post-Black Death samples had a higher proportion of older adults, suggesting that survival may have improved following the epidemic. A total of 600 skeletons from London cemeteries were analysed. Researchers used the bones to model age estimates and mortality risks. The post-plague samples had a higher proportion of older adults, suggesting survival improved after the epidemic. Stock image of skeletons found with signs of the plague pictured . The Black Death is thought to have killed between 75 and 200 million people across Europe from 1347 to 1351. Recent analysis of DNA from victims indicated the pathogen responsible for the plague was the Yersinia pestis bacterium. It is believed to have originated in central Asia, before reaching the Crimea by 1346. Rats are thought to have carried infected fleas on merchant ships throughout the Mediterranean and Europe. Research suggests it took 150 years for Europe's population to recover from the effects of the plague. And results of hazards analysis - published in the journal PLOS ONE - indicate that, overall, mortality risks were lower in the post-Black Death population than before the epidemic. ‘Together, these results may indicate enhanced survival and decreased mortality after the Black Death, and by inference, improved health in some age groups in the post-epidemic population,’ said Dr DeWitte. Although other factors could have influenced the differences, including the migration of people to London after the plague, Dr DeWitte suggests the study highlights the power infectious diseases have in shaping the population. This includes the health and demography, over both the short and long-term. She added: ‘This study suggests that even in the face of major threats to health, such as repeated plague outbreaks, several generations of people who lived after the Black Death were healthier in general than people who lived before the epidemic.’","Researchers sampled 600 skeletons taken from London cemeteries .

"By . Lizzie Parry . A simple handshake could reveal the true age of a person, new research has revealed. Scientists have discovered that hand-grip strength correlated with known markers of ageing, including disability, mental decline, recovery time after hospital treatment and death. The team from the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria, believe a 'handshake test' could be used as a viable test for biological age. A simple handshake could reveal a person's age, a new scientific study has found . 'Hand-grip strength is easily measured . and data on hand-grip strength now can be found in many of the most . important surveys on ageing worldwide,' said Dr Warren Sanderson. The research, published in the online journal Public Library of Science ONE, reviewed findings from more than 50 studies looking at people of all ages from around the world. It found that higher grip strength corresponded with indicators of younger biological age in different population groups. Co-author Dr Serguei Scherbov, also from the IIASA, said: 'We found that based on this survey, a 65-year-old white woman who had not completed secondary education has the same hand-grip strength as a 69-year-old white woman who had completed secondary education. 'This suggests that according to hand-grip strength characteristic their ages are equivalent and the 65 year-old woman ages four years faster due to lower education attainment.' A team at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria have found a direct correlation between hand-grip strength and known markers of ageing including disability, mental decline and recovery time after treatment in hospital . Previous research has shown that simply measuring the number of years people have lived does not provide an accurate picture of biologically how old they are. Dr Scherbov added: 'Our goal is to measure how fast different groups in a society age. 'If some group is getting older faster than another, we can ask why that might be and see whether there are any policies that could help the faster ageing group.'","Study underway at International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . As the height of summer approaches, doctors are warning people about the risks of skin cancer, urging them to get any unusual looking moles checked out by doctors. But the process of investigating these lesions can be a long-winded and, in some cases, complicated process. A Houston professor is hoping to drastically cut the time it takes to identify cancerous cells using a smartphone app and attachment - and he even claims it is more accurate than doctors. The DermoScreen app works with a dermoscope attachment, pictured. The lens scans unusual looking lesions before highlighting potentially cancerous cells. During tests, the app was accurate in 85% of cases based on visual characteristics - higher than the 50% to 70% average accuracy rate of family doctors . There is an app already on the market that claims to spot potentially cancerous moles and lesions. Doctor Mole' uses augmented reality to check moles for irregularities in size, shape, colour and border. After taking a picture of a mole, the user is presented with a colour-coded 'risk' level for each of these characteristics. The app can archive and compare data to check for any changes in a mole. It will also remind the user when it's time to check a mole again. But the Doctor Mole app should not be used as an alternative to seeing a doctor. The app, called DermoScreen, is now being evaluated at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Centre. If successful, it could make quick and inexpensive screening a reality for millions of people who lack access to medical specialists. George Zouridakis, professor of engineering technology at Houston University, has worked on the project since 2005. The goal is to provide quick screening in rural areas or in the developing world, where specialty medical care generally isn't available, he said. Early testing found the device to be accurate 85 per cent of the time, based on visual characteristics. This is slightly lower than the 90 per cent accuracy rate for dermatologists, but more accurate than family doctors, who have an accuracy average of between 50 and 70 per cent, according to official U.S industry figures. The app is now being evaluated for further testing at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Centre. If successful, it could make quick and inexpensive screening a reality for millions of people who lack access to medical specialists, claimed the researchers. Stock image of melanoma is pictured . A separate app called Doctor Mole, pictured, uses augmented reality to check moles for irregularities in size, shape, colour and border . Once launched, patients would be referred for follow-up if the lesions spotted on the app were suspected to be cancerous. In addition to a mobile phone, the technology uses a dermoscope attachment - a special magnifying lens that costs about $500 (£294) and provides special illumination of the area being photographed. Before the app becomes widely available, Zouridakis said he wants to make sure it is as accurate as possible. He is also looking into other diagnostic uses for the technology, such as testing the device’s ability to screen Buruli ulcer, a flesh-eating bacterial disease, in Africa. Dr. Ana Ciurea, assistant professor of dermatology at MD Anderson, said the project is in the early stages but looks promising. ‘Our research with Dr. Zouridakis on his promising iPhone app will focus on evaluating its use for risk assessment and as a screening tool for early detection of melanomas,’ she said. ‘We are in early stages of planning and approval for this project, but such an application, if validated, has the potential for widespread use to ultimately improve patient care.’","The DermoScreen app works with a high-quality dermoscope attachment .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . A woman born without a vagina has had one made using skin from her thigh. The 26-year-old anonymous woman had surgery in Argentina after discovering she had Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome when she was 14. This is characterised by the absence of the vagina, womb  and cervix and is a congenital abnormality affecting one in 5,000 women. A woman born without a vagina has had one made using skin from her thigh, surgeons have reported . Plastic surgeons in San Martin, Buenos Aires, used an unusual technique whereby a vaginoplasty was performed using the internal skin of the woman's thigh. This allowed surgeons to avoid opening the woman's abdomen to get a portion of the colon, which is the usual way to perform the procedure, according to surgeon Hector Lanza, head of the hospital's Plastic Surgery and Reconstructive department. The surgery was performed in 2012 but has only come to light now after a paper about the case was reported in the journal Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, published by the International Society of Aesthetic Surgery (ISAPS). It follows the news last month that four woman suffering from the same syndrome were given new artificial vaginas grown in a laboratory. Their new vaginas were engineered by scientists at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center's Institute for Regenerative Medicine in the U.S, using the women's own cells. One of the women who received a new vagina, interviewed by New Scientist, says the procedure helped to normalise her life. She said: 'At the beginning it wasn't . easy, thinking that a part of your body was going to be made in a . laboratory. It was difficult to understand. Yuanyuan Zhang demonstrates the process where four young women born with abnormal or missing vaginas were implanted with lab-grown versions made from their own cells . 'But as the years pass and with the good results, you find a way of life which is different but not too far from normality.' Women with MRKH have normally functioning ovaries and so will experience the normal signs of puberty but will not have periods or be able to conceive. The external genitalia are completely normal which is why MRKH isn’t usually discovered until women are in their teenage years. It’s usually discovered when the woman tries to has sex or fails to get her period. Many women are able to create a vaginal canal using dilation treatment, which uses cylinder shaped dilators of different sizes to stretch the muscles. However, if this is unsuccessful then surgery will be used to stretch the vaginal canal. Following treatment women are able to have intercourse and can have their eggs removed and fertilised to be used in surrogacy.","The 26-year-old anonymous woman had surgery in Argentina .

"By . Ben Spencer . Climate change is already having an impact on every part of the US, according to a doom-laden report published by the Obama administration. The third US National Climate Assessment, released today, says the number and strength of extreme weather events have increased over the past 50 years. The report is expected to guide the actions of President Barack Obama, who has indicated he aims to make the issue a defining part of his last two years in office. Scroll Down for Video . The US National Climate Assessment says that climate change is already having an effect on every part of the US. This map shows percent increases in the amount of precipitation falling in very heavy events from 1958 to 2012 for each region of the continental US . His influence will be vital in creating a successor to the Kyoto Protocol next year, when the United Nations aims to set legally binding targets for every country to reduce carbon emissions at a summit in Paris. President Obama is set to use the paper to convince the American public on the need for a crackdown on greenhouse gas emissions. The report, compiled by 300 experts and released by the White House, said: ‘Climate change, once considered an issue for a distant future, has moved firmly into the present. ‘Corn producers in Iowa, oyster growers in Washington State, and maple syrup producers in Vermont are all observing climate-related changes that are outside of recent experience.’ More than half the US population lives in coastal areas that are ‘increasingly vulnerable’ to the effects of climate change, the report said. And efforts to cut emissions so far are ‘insufficient to avoid increasingly negative social, environmental, and economic consequences’, it concluded. This photo shows the cracked-dry bed of the Almaden Reservoir in San Jose, California. Global warming is rapidly turning America the beautiful into America the stormy, sneezy and dangerous, according to a new federal scientific report . This graph shows observed global average changes (black line) in the climate, model simulations using only changes in natural factors like solar and volcanic (green) and model simulations with the addition of human-induced emissions (blue). Such changes since 1950 cannot be explained by natural factors or variability and can only be explained by human factors, says the report . The 800-page report says the consequences of climate change are hitting on several fronts, including health, infrastructure, water supply, agriculture and especially in more frequent severe weather such as floods and droughts. It added: ‘Global climate change is projected to continue to change over this century and beyond, but there is still time to act to limit the amount of change and the extent of damaging impacts.’ John Podesta, an adviser to President Obama, said the report includes ‘a huge amount of practical, usable knowledge that state and local decision-makers can take advantage of as they plan on or for the impacts of climate change and work to make their communities more resilient’. He added: ‘This assessment is about presenting actionable science.’ Vicki Arroyo, executive director of the Georgetown Climate Center of Georgetown University, said: ‘You really can’t just provide a report that paints this dark picture of all these impacts. ‘You have to couple it with a message of what our government can do about it, what you can do about it and what our communities can do.’ Water splashes over the Center Street Dam in the swollen Des Moines River in downtown Des Moines, Iowa. Climate change's assorted harms are expected to become increasingly disruptive across the nation throughout this century and beyond, the National Climate Assessment concluded Tuesday . The report echoes the message of the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which last month published the final part in a trilogy of reports into the science, impact and solutions to global warming. The first part, published last September, found that scientists are 95 per cent certain that humans are the ‘dominant cause’ of global warming. The second part, published in March, warned that the drastic impacts of climate change are ‘already occurring on all continents and across the oceans’. The final part, published in April on the options for mitigating global warming, warned that a rapid shift to wind and solar power is needed before 2030. An enormous region of East Antarctica is far more vulnerable to thaw that previously thought, according to a new study published today in the journal Nature Climate Change. Researchers of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research claim that global warming could trigger an unstoppable slide of ice into the ocean and raise world sea levels for thousands of years. The Wilkes Basin in East Antarctica, stretching more than 600 miles (1,000 km) inland, has enough ice to raise world sea levels by 10 to 13 feet (three to four metres). The Wilkes is vulnerable because it is held in place by a small rim of ice, resting on bedrock below sea level by the coast of the frozen continent. That 'ice plug' might melt away in coming centuries if ocean waters warm up. 'East Antarctica's Wilkes Basin is like a bottle on a slant. Once uncorked, it empties out,' Matthias Mengel of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, lead author of the study in the journal Nature Climate Change, said in a statement.","The third US National Climate Assessment warns of worsening weather .
