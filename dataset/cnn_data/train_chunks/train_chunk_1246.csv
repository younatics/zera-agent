"Ruling: Oscar Pistorius will be allowed to travel abroad to compete after winning an . appeal against his bail conditions . Oscar Pistorius is free to compete in Britain this summer after a judge relaxed his bail terms to allow him to make money. Lawyers for the ‘Blade Runner’ successfully argued that he should be allowed to travel abroad and ‘earn . income’ while awaiting trial. The controversial decision clears the way for him to take part in London’s showpiece athletics event at the Olympic Stadium. Pistorius, 26, is charged with the . murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, who was shot after she locked . herself in his bathroom in the early hours of Valentine’s Day. He claims . he mistook her for an intruder. The Olympic and Paralympic athlete . was not present as judge Bert Bam told North Gauteng High Court in South . Africa that bail restrictions should be eased to allow Pistorius to . travel abroad to compete at international athletics meetings, provided . he handed over a detailed itinerary at least a week before his . departure. Miss Steenkamp’s family did not comment on the decision, which came despite strong objections from prosecutors. It is certain to prove controversial . as  it potentially paves the way for Pistorius, one of the world’s most . successful athletes, to earn vast sums of money while he  is awaiting . trial. Although charged with murder, . Pistorius has not been convicted of any crime  and would be allowed to . enter Britain by the Home Office. It is now likely that he will compete . at the London Anniversary Games, which takes place from July 26 to 28 . at the Olympic Stadium in East London – one year on from London 2012 and . the final event at the venue before work begins to convert into the . home of West Ham football club. It is also the last major athletics event before the World Championships in Moscow two weeks later. Significantly, Pistorius’ agent Peet van . Zyl said yesterday that the competitions could be ‘on the radar’ for . the athlete, who  last year became the first to  take part in both an . Olympic and Paralympic Games. Scroll down for video . Set for a return? Pistorius wins gold in the men's 400m - T44 final at the . London Paralympics. His lawyers argued that he might need to run at track meets . again to earn money . Conditions: Pistorius must provide authorities with his travel plans at . least a week before he leaves the country. He must also return his passport to the court within 24 hours of returning to South Africa . The International Association of Athletics Federations said the double amputee would be allowed to compete in this summer’s competitions if he qualifies. Yannis Nikolau, spokesman for the ruling body, added that Pistorus would be ‘free to run . . . on the basis of the “innocent until proven guilty” principle’. There is also the possibility that Pistorius, who can receive tens of thousands of pounds in appearance money, could compete in the British Athletics Birmingham Grand Prix at the end of June. At yesterday’s bail appeal hearing, Pistorius’ lawyer Barry Roux said that while his client had no immediate plans to compete, it is likely he would need to return to the track to earn money. Since his arrest the Paralympic gold medallist has sold assets including a share in a racehorse and property. ‘He is not going to run away and hide. He is going nowhere,’ Mr Roux told the judge. Defence: Pistorius says he killed girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp accidentally when he fired shots through a door in his bathroom in the pre-dawn hours, fearing there was an intruder in his house . Victim: Reeva Steenkamp, a successful South African fashion model and television personality,  was found dead at the home she shared with the paralympic athlete . ‘It’s only, only, only to earn . income . . . No other reason and under controlled circumstances. Why . stop him from travelling under controlled circumstances?’ Mr Roux also argued that Pistorius . should be able to return to his home and the scene of the shooting, . which has been investigated by the prosecution. ‘The accused can’t be stopped [from . going] back to his house indefinitely,’ he insisted. Pistorius claims he . killed 29-year-old model Miss Steenkamp accidentally when he fired . shots through his bathroom door in the early hours, fearing she was an . intruder. Prosecutors say he shot her intentionally after they argued. Pistorius competes against able-bodied athletes during London's 2012 Olympic games . His bail terms originally required . him to hand over his passport, avoid his home in Pretoria and all . witnesses in the case, report to a police station twice a week and . abstain from drinking alcohol. But these rules were relaxed by Judge Bam, who described the decision not to grant Pistorius permission to travel as ‘wrong’. He also no longer has to be regularly supervised by a probation official and the ban against him drinking alcohol was lifted.","July meet at Olympic Stadium to showcase 'Paralympic champions of 2012'

"The site of a dead blue whale is proving to be New Zealand's newest attraction this week with tourists flocking to see the 100-tonne beast off the country's North Island. The animal, known to be the largest and heaviest which has ever existed, was spotted on Tuesday along Taranaki shore, near New Plymouth, just a day after it was seen drifting upside down by a passing ship about 5km out to sea. Its sheer size and scale was put into perspective by videographer Stefan Nagel who posted a three-minute clip to YouTube featuring he, his father and a host of other excited onlookers examining the amazing creature from up close. Mr Nagel shows the sheer size and scale of the 100-tonne Blue Whale with one foot on its back and one its flipper . Beached: Stefan Nagel's father walks all over the whale which washed up on the New Zealand west coast on Monday . Scientists could not determine the exact cause of death for the 100-tonne beast but they believed it died of natural causes . Looking slightly worse for wear, the footage shows the animal with parts of its body cut and dissected from a necropsy - an animal autopsy - which scientists undertook to determine its cause of death. Taranaki Department of Conservation acting senior biodiversity ranger Callum Lilley said it was too difficult to determine how it died, because its organs had deteriorated so badly. He did say, however, that it appeared no shark or predator had tried to devour the whale and it died of natural causes. Mr Nagel told Daily Mail Australia that he drove to Taranaki Shore before walking some 2km along the remote coastline to where the whale was resting. He said it was like 'stepping back in time into another era' when he and his father eventually spotted it. 'I felt humbled and in awe at the same time, being up close and personal to something that big,' he said. 'There were lots of rocks as well as algae surrounding the dead Blue Whale and I had to do a lot of careful climbing to capture all angles of the whale.' Blue Whale's are the largest species of animal that has ever been known to exist on earth .

"They are words which will strike fear into every addict - we're running out of chocolate. That's according to the world's largest confectionary producer, which has joined Mars in warning of a massive shortfall which could reach a million tonnes a year by 2020. Switzerland's Barry Callebaut Group said soaring demand have helped chocolate prices hit more than double what they were just eight years ago. Scroll down for video . Help! We're running out of chocolate - at least according to the world's biggest confectionary producer . The warning was issued by Juergen Steinemann (left), chief executive of Switzerland's Barry Callebaut Group . The supplier, which provides chocolate for firms from global giants to artisan bakers, has revealed it sold 1.7million tonnes in 2013/14 - a rise of 11.7 per cent on the year before. But there are limited quantities of the fragile crop - which means as production rises, so does the price. That leaves manufacturers with little choice but to raise prices on the shelves, make bars smaller or pack them with fruit, nuts and wafers. Industry experts say the world is in its longest production shortfall for five decades. Cocoa prices rose by a quarter in a year to a peak in August of £2,000 a tonne, nearing a February 2011 peak, Barry Callebaut said. Dream job? A quality control technician tests a sample from a giant vat of chocolate in a factory (file photo) Rising prices: How cocoa costs are approaching their 2011 peak again in dollars (red line) and SDR (blue line), a combination of four major currencies - the U.S. dollar, British pound, Japanese Yen and the Euro . Before the end of 2007 they had barely risen above £1,300. In 2005 they hovered around just £1,000, according to figures from the London-based International Cocoa Organization (ICCO). Barry Callebaut chief executive Juergen Steinemann said the hike was fuelled partly by a 'potential cocoa shortage' by 2020 - echoing previous warnings by Mars Chocolate. The British-founded sweet treats giant has repeatedly claimed demand will outstrip supply by a million tonnes a year by 2020. 'The global cocoa sector may suffer a 1million metric ton shortfall by 2020 because of increasing economic and environmental pressures on cocoa farms around the world,' the firm said. 'Our long-term business depends on a sustainable supply of high quality cocoa, and we believe that securing cocoa’s future begins with increasing yield for the smallholder farmers.' Butterfly effect: The chaos caused by the Ebola outbreak (pictured) has affected West African cocoa exports . Partly to blame are disease and drought, according to Bloomberg News - which could be beaten by resilient new breeds of cocoa beans. But we are also getting hungrier for sweet treats - especially  in developing nations like China. Barry Callebaut's sales grew by 9.3 per cent in Asia last year - compared to 5.4 per cent in the Americas and just 0.1 per cent in western Europe. Mars opened a £170million new plant in Kansas earlier this year to meet rising demand, and last month Barry Callebaut announced it would pour £7.3million into its factory in Sao Paulo, Brazil. But some surprising news events have a hand in the price, including the Ebola outbreak. Because 70 per cent of the world's cocoa comes from West Africa, chaos and quarantine restrictions mean global production has dipped by 0.7 per cent, the ICCO said. And pledges to beat Third World poverty could also have an impact - as many African cocoa farmers live on less than £1 a day.","Swiss-based Barry Callebaut Group warns of global deficit by 2020 .

"Plans to demolish the birthplace of the Prophet Mohamed to make way for the imam's residence and a presidential palace are set to go ahead. The plans proposing to erect a modern complex on the house said to be where the Prophet was born are part of a multi-billion-dollar redevelopment of the pilgrimage city of Mecca. To make way for the new development, library steps leading away from the Masjid al-Haram, or Grand Mosque, which sits on top of what is believed to be the place where the Prophet was born, will be swept away. Over the past decade the Saudi royal family has spent billions of dollars expanding the Grand Mosque . Muslim pilgrims perform the final walk around the Kaaba at the Grand Mosque - the focal point of Islam . Last year Saudi Arabia's royal family dropped initial plans to replace the sacred library, which stands on a raised plinth. There had been proposals to replace it with either a metro rail station that would serve pilgrims - or a sweeping new library dedicated to King Abdul Aziz, founder of the modern kingdom. The Saudi Binladin Group who are in charge of the development, propose that it be razed to the ground and replaced with the imam’s residence and an adjacent presidential palace, The Independent reported. The Saudi royal family follow the Wahabi faith, that has served as the kingdom’s official religion ever since the al-Sauds rose to power in the 19th century. The kingdom’s rulers, who deny Mohamed was born in what is known as the House of Mawlid, are opposed to preserving relics of the Prophet because they say it encourages shirq, the sin of worshipping idols other than God. There are plans to demolish the birthplace of the Prophet Mohamed to make way for the imam's residence and a presidential palace . The proposals are sure to provoke fury from Muslims around the world as the Grand Mosque is the focal point of the Islamic faith, where pilgrims flock to pray. The annual Haj pilgrimage, which sees millions of pilgrims descend on the beautiful structure, must be performed at least once in their lifetime by all Muslims capable of making the expensive, difficult journey, a duty that applies equally to Sunni and Shi'ite Muslims at a time of tension between Islam's main sects. In 2012, nearly three million pilgrims performed the haj, with roughly a third from inside the conservative kingdom. All Muslims must face towards the Kaaba, the huge black cube at the centre of the Grand Mosque, five times a day for prayer, making a visit to the sanctuary a powerful experience. Pilgrims must circle it seven times when they arrive in Mecca. Saudi Arabia's king is formally titled Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques and the ruling family has long based its claims to reign on its guardianship of Islam's birthplace. Over the past decade it has spent billions of dollars expanding the Grand Mosque and building new infrastructure to avert the stampedes and tent fires that marred past pilgrimages with hundreds of deaths. The last deadly stampede was in 2006, when 360 people were crushed to death.","Plans to demolish the birthplace of the Prophet Mohamed .

"American Sniper hit the mark with moviegoers again this weekend, becoming the biggest hit of Clint Eastwood's storied career. The military drama starring Bradley Cooper as Navy SEAL marksman Chris Kyle topped the box office for a second weekend in a row with $64.4 million in first place, according to studio estimates Sunday. American Sniper is up for six Academy Awards, including best picture and best actor for Cooper. The total haul for the Warner Bros. film now stands at $200.1 million. American Sniper hit the mark with moviegoers again this weekend, becoming the biggest hit of Clint Eastwood's storied career . American Sniper also earned an additional $17.6 million in 16 international territories, including Australia, Sweden, Norway and Denmark. 'We've never quite seen anything like this at this time of year,' said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at box-office tracker Rentrak. 'American Sniper is helping to propel the box office, which is already 9.3 percent ahead of the same time last year.' Showbiz 411 notes that the huge box office haul has now surpassed the $148 million totals of 2008's Gran Torino. The film, directed by Clint Eastwood, already broke box-office records when it expanded to wide release last weekend, easily surpassing Avatar to become the biggest January opening for a movie and immediately becoming the top grosser among best-picture Oscar nominees. The huge box office haul has now surpassed the $148 million totals of 2008's Gran Torino. In a distant second place, the saucy Universal thriller The Boy Next Door featuring Jennifer Lopez as a teacher who engages in an affair with a younger man played by Ryan Guzman, debuted with $15 million. The weekend's other major new releases weren't even in the neighborhood of The Boy Next Door. The animated fantasy Strange Magic from Luscasfilm and Disney flopped in seventh place with $5.5 million. Lionsgate's Johnny Depp dud Mortdecai tanked in ninth place with $4.1 million. The eccentric heist comedy, which also stars Gwyneth Paltrow, marks another box-office bomb for Depp, following the leading man's disappointing Transcendence, 'The Lone Ranger, 'Dark Shadows and ""The Rum Diary."" American Sniper is up for six Academy Awards, including best picture and best actor for Cooper . 'I think he chooses projects that appeal to him,' Dergarabedian said. 'I've always appreciated Johnny Depp for marching to the beat of his own drum, but he still needs to get audiences in the door. Sometimes, if you go too far afield, that's reflected in the numbers.' Overseas, 'The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies' dominated the international box office with $54.2 million. The final installment of the Middle-earth saga debuted in China with $49.5 million.","The military drama starring Bradley Cooper as Navy SEAL marksman Chris Kyle topped the box office for a second weekend in a row with $64.4 million in first place, according to studio estimates Sunday .

"Jilted first lady Valerie Trierweiler last night arrived in India to begin a ‘Princess Diana-style’ charity trip – while insisting she is still in love with Francois Hollande. Ms Trierweiler arrived at Mumbai airport soon after midnight local time and was swamped with photographers as she made her way to a waiting limousine. Ms Trierweiler's webpage on the official Elysee Palace website has already been removed, along with her official Twitter account. Her five staff office at the Elysee has also been shut down, and she is not expected to enter the palace again. Scroll down for video . Valerie Trierweiler, former partner of French President Francois Hollande, is escorted by security after she arrived in India at around midnight local time . Ms Trierweiler was swamped by photographers as she was escorted to a waiting limousine . Ms Trierweiler was wearing a dark trouser suit and looked relaxed and happy after enjoying first class service on the Air France plane. Three bodyguards and a number of Indian Army soldiers tried to keep the crowds back as Ms Trierweiler smiled broadly and waived regally without commenting. Ms Trierweiler got into the back of a waiting black limousine by herself and continued to smile and waive as she was driven to the five star Taj Majal Palace hotel.

Ms Trierweiler struggles to get to her car through scores of photographers at the airport . The rest of her entourage followed in a second limousine. Her arrival comes within a few hours of the president confirming his separation from the firebrand 48-year-old with a brusque 18 word statement. Despite the split, Ms Trierweiler has made clear she wants to remain on the world stage. It led to her being widely mocked by senior women politicians, with former health minister Roselyne Bachelot tweeting: ‘Valerie – the new Diana?’ Despite losing her perks, Trierweiler (pictured today) was driven to Charles de Gaulle airport in a limousine accompanied by police outriders, and will have a bodyguard with her in India . Police secure Trierweiler's route. French president Francois Hollande announced yesterday that the couple have officially split . The late Princess Diana and . self-styled ‘Queen of Hearts’ famously devoted herself to humanitarian . and charitable causes following her divorce from Prince Charles. Diana . was always a member of the Royal Family but Ms Trierweiler, in . contrast, has now officially lost her title of first lady, and all the . perks that go with it. Earlier today, she was driven on to the runway at Charles de Gaulle airport in a limousine . accompanied by police outriders, and will have a bodyguard and her old . chief of staff, Patrice Biancone, with her in India. But . an Elysee Palace aide said this was solely to ensure they can ‘keep an . eye’ on a woman who is now viewed as a loose cannon who could do a great . deal of harm to Mr Hollande. It will be the last time Ms Trierweiler enjoys government support on a foreign trip, the aide insisted. The . twice divorced Paris Match journalist nicknamed ‘The Rottweiler’ has . been briefing the media ever since photographs were published on January . 10th which proved the president was having an affair with the actress . Julie Gayet, 41. Ms Trierweiler is seen leaving the presidential summer residence of La Lanterne in Versailles ahead of her trip .

Trierweiler is thought to be behind reports in today’s Le Parisien which . contain ‘a friend’ saying: ‘What’s sad for her, is not so much leaving . the Elysee and all its decorum, but losing the man whom she loves’. She . refused to sign a legal agreement confirming the split, leaving Mr . Hollande to awkwardly announce it by himself in a phone call to French . news agency AFP on Saturday. Ms . Trierweiler is said to have smashed up antique furniture on hearing of . her then boyfriend’s cheating, and then spent eight days in a public . hospital suffering from stress. She . then moved to La Lanterne, the hugely luxurious presidential retreat in . Versailles, west of Paris, which comes complete with heated swimming . pool and wine cellar. Such . behaviour infuriated ordinary French people, who have seen Mr Hollande’s . Socialist policies plunge the country into economic disaster. Mr Hollande, who had never married, is now . expected to remain a 'bachelor president' for a while, while continuing . with his relationship with Ms Gayet outside the Elysee. Organised . and partly funded by the charity Action Contre La Faim (Fight Against . Hunger, ACF), the trip to India will see Ms Trierweiler staying at the . five star Taj Palace Hotel in Mumbai. One . of her trips in India will be to a children’s hospital, and her friend . Charlotte Valandrey – who is accompanying her on the trip – said today: . ‘This is a strong woman, a woman of heart, who is engaged in the ACF . project since long before Francois Hollande became president’. Nadine . Morano, another former minister, said she had ‘no sympathy’ for Ms . Trierweiler, and that the whole saga proved how much the Socialist . government was ‘prepared to lie’ to the people of France. Jean-Marie . Le Pen, founder of the Front National, in turn said that Ms Trierweiler . had not even divorced her second husband, and attacked Mr Hollande for . having four children out of wedlock. ‘Exemplary . president?’ tweeted Mr Pen. ‘Not in private – four children out of . marriage and a non-divorced mistress whom he couldn’t even be faithful . to!’ A mass ‘Day of Anger’ demonstration was held against the Hollande administration in Paris . today, with organisers saying 120,000 people calling for the president’s . resignation took part. Strikes against President Francois Hollande took place in Paris today . Demonstrators wore masks and had signs with 'Police Politique' tied around their necks for the protest . Riot police were out on the streets of Paris tonight as protestors went on the rampage. By nightfall, there were 150 arrests, mainly for public order offences, and some 20 officers were injured. Many were protesting against the Socialist’s appalling economic record, which has seen unemployment soar above the 3 million mark and the cost of living spiral. The worst violence was in the upmarket 7th arrondissement, close to the French Parliament, where hooded protestors started to light fires and throw missiles at police. ‘Iron bars and garbage was among the material being thrown, and we had to respond with tear gas,’ said one officer. 'Some police have been very badly injured'. Manuel Valls, the Interior Minister, immediately appealed for calm, blaming the trouble on ‘individuals, disparate groups, and the extreme and ultra right’. He said there aim was ‘to create confusion by violently attacking representatives of law enforcement’, adding that ‘everything will be done to find the perpetrators of these outrages.’ Organisers say 120,000 attended the Day Of Anger protest today . However, police estimated the figure was more like 17,000 . An opinion poll published over the weekend confirmed that Ms .

"A shock poll revealed less than two weeks before the referendum shows Scottish voters are leaning towards Alex Salmond's Yes campaign for independence. The study revealed 51 per cent will vote to breakaway from the United Kingdom on September 18, overturning a  22-point lead for the Better Together Campaign. It comes after Alistair Darling failed to impress voters during the second of two  heated debates with the SNP leader on August 25. Scroll d own for video . A shock new poll revealed just 11 days before the referendum shows 51 per cent of voters are backing Alex Salmond's Yes campaign . The poll, carried out by YouGov for The Sunday Times, found 49 per cent of the Scottish electorate will safely vote No when asked whether the country should leave the union. It is the first time the pollsters revealed a Yes campaign lead, despite others suggesting just that in previous months. According to the data, 35 per cent of Scottish voters who previously supported Labour's pro-union campaign are deserting it - more than double the 18 per cent reported last month. The under-forties, working class and female voters are also reported to have swayed towards independence. The two point gap falls within an error margin for polls, with some experts considering such a small difference too close to call. The new data puts the Yes campaign in the lead for the first time with just two points now separating the two sides . It comes after Alistair Darling failed to impress viewers in the second of two televised debates with the SNP leader . Last month the Yes campaign enjoyed a surge in support following the second of two televised debates between the former Chancellor and First Minister of Scotland. A snap poll taken after the August 25 debate revealed 71 per cent of viewers considered the SNP leader the victor following a string of stinging put-downs over Darling's concern for currency. Many remained turned-off by Salmond's aggressive nature however, with leader shouting over his opponent more than once during the BBC broadcast.","Fifty-one per cent of voters to choose independence on September 18 .

"Football stars including Alan Hansen, Ally McCoist and David Moyes have been targeted by their own supporters after coming out in favour of the union. Sixteen of Scotland's greatest ever footballers as well as managers Billy McNeill and Walter Smith released a statement today calling for people to reject the independence proposals on September 18. One Tweet attacking former BBC pundit Alan Hansen even published a photograph of his house on Merseyside. One Twitter commentator described Murdo MacLeod as a Tory c*** due to his rejection of independence . The Yes Scotland campaign published an aerial photograph of Alan Hansen's Merseyside home in response . The team, which includes 16 players from the 1960s to the 2000s and former Old Firm managers Billy McNeill and Walter Smith issued a joint statement through the Better Together organisation. They said: 'We are proud Scots who have been proud to represent our country around the world. When Scotland calls, we answer. 'We are proud that Scotland has always stood on its own two feet but we also believe that Scotland stands taller because we are part of the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom is a country Scotland helped to build. 'We urge every patriotic Scot to help maintain Scotland’s place in the United Kingdom which has served Scotland so well.' The intervention of the high profile footballers has not been welcomed by people promoting a Yes vote. Former Match of the Day pundit, Alan Hansen is among 16 former Scottish players to reject independence . Former Old Firm managers Billy McNeill, left, and Walter Smith, right, are 'managing' the squad of 16 . Some of the football stars, such as Alan Hansen and Paddy Crerand  have been criticised for joining the debate as they no longer live in Scotland. Hansen left for Liverpool in 1977 while Crerand arrived in Manchester in 1963. Other footballers such as Ally McCoist faced abuse over the fact that previous comments may have been seen as being in favour of independence. Murdo MacLeod was accused of wanting to strip and privatise the National Health Service which saved his life. Other Twitter users described him as a Tory. Other pro-independence supporters questioned Hansen's qualifications for commenting on economic matters . Paddy Crerand's relevance to the debate was raised over the length of time he has lived in England . Pro-independence activists criticised some of the players over the fact that they no longer live in Scotland . Scottish Labour's deputy leader Anas Sarwar praised the intervention of the footballers. Speaking to the Daily Record, he said: 'These men have played for the national team, have led Scotland and are now saying what they believe is best for Scotland.This shows that there is no shortage of passion and patriotism from those that are voting No. 'This isn’t a choice about whether Scotland is a nation or not as, these legends show, Scotland already is a proud nation. 'This is a choice of what vision we think is best for our future in Scotland and we believe that is solidarity, unity and teamwork.' Former Manchester United manager David Moyes, left, and current Rangers manager Ally McCoist have also lent their support to the No campaign according to the Better Together campaign . Speaking at an event to launch the statement in Glasgow, football commentator and Better Together supporter Archie Macpherson called on the No side to inject more heart into its arguments during the final days of campaigning. He said: 'It has been a logical and rational presentation of facts on the currency, North Sea oil, pensions and so on, which are absolutely vital, but it has got to be backed up with conviction and passion. 'So it is not just reasoned arguments - you have got to reach out and communicate with people.' Some pro-independence supporters showed a statement by Ally McCoist designed to damage the No campaign . Mr Macpherson, who recently spoke out for the union at a rally in Dundee, added: 'All these figures played with passion - people on the terracing responded with passion, passion was at the core of football in Scotland, and it was only passion that kept us going against bigotry. 'And they are backing the last home stretch passionately and the people on the terracing will recognise that, and I am sure they will go with them.' The full line-up includes Alex McLeish, Jim Leighton, David Moyes, Alan Hansen, Willie Miller, Paddy Crerand, Davie Provan, Barry Ferguson, Bertie Auld, Denis Law, Ally McCoist, Derek Johnstone, Murdo MacLeod, Ian Durrant, John Brown and Frank McAvennie. However, following today's announcement, members of the pro independence movement have taken to social media to criticise Hansen's intervention in the debate. One Twitter account for the Yes Scotland campaign even published an aerial photograph of Hansen's Merseyside house. Michael Stewart, a former Scottish international footballer, pundit and Yes Scotland campaigner, said: ""It's always interesting to hear different views on this big issue, and I am hearing many, many other voices within the football world who are backing Yes. 'The real strength of the Yes campaign is seen in the many fans' groups who are backing independence right across the country. 'And this is just symbolic of the groups and movements from all walks of life in the powerful, ever-growing grassroots movement who, I believe, will help deliver the all-important Yes vote in just over a week's time.' In recent weeks, celebrities such as JK Rowling, Sir Alex Ferguson and Susan Boyle have all previously come out in support of a no vote. David Bowie used his acceptance speech at the Brit Awards to urge 'Scotland stay with us'. However, comedian Frankie Boyle and James Bond star Sir Sean Connery have both said Scotland would benefit by independence. With polling day approaching on September 18, the gap held by the No campaign has fallen to just six points with 53 percent of the population planning to reject independence - down from 73 per cent in May. Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond is confident that the Yes campaign can close the gap by September 18 .

Princess Michael of Kent talks to Conrad Black during an interview to promote her new book . The interview began with the Princess saying she could not talk about Britain's Royal Family. But when asked about William and Kate, she said: 'Of course we're thrilled to have a beautiful young married couple with a baby. 'Let's hope there are more marriages soon because I think to have that young generation is terribly good for the people. 'The people love to see happy young people and I think the older generation are a bit boring for most people.' Black then quizzed her about Princess Diana. She said: 'She was my next door neighbour at Kensington Palace and I must say I was very fond of her, very attached to her. She had an enormous amount of goodness in her. Controversial: Princess Diana was 'uneducated' and the older royals are 'boring' according to Princess Michael of Kent (pictured) 'Like probably many people of little education who find themselves, like pop stars or film stars, suddenly lauded by the whole world, it is very difficult if you have not had a mother bringing you up who was quite stern and strict. 'She did not have a mother bring her up and she did not have much education, so it is much harder to cope with eulogy.' Princess Diana became a nursery teacher after leaving school with no O-levels. Princess Michael, a divorcee from Bohemia, married the Queen's cousin Prince Michael in 1978. She is the author of a number of books including her latest historical novel The Queen of Four Kingdoms. However, her comments have sparked outrage however among royal circles. Lady Colin Campbell, the royal biographer, described the remarks as 'rubbish'. While Ashley Walton, co-author of Prince Philip: Wise Words And Golden Gaffes, told the Sunday Express: 'Philip is 93 this year but he is anything but boring. 'In many ways he and the Queen are far more interesting than the younger royals because of what they have experienced in their long lives.' Black, a convicted felon in the U.S., was perhaps a curious choice to conduct the interview. The Canadian-born 69-year-old controlled Hollinger . International, once the world's third-largest English-language newspaper . empire, which published the Chicago Sun Times, other major . international titles such as The Daily Telegraph in the UK and hundreds of community newspapers in North . America. In . 2004, a shareholder-initiated prosecution of Black began in the U.S. over $80 million in assets claimed to have been improperly taken . or inappropriately spent by Black. He . was convicted of three counts of fraud and one count of obstruction of . justice in a U.S. court in 2007 and sentenced to six and a half years' imprisonment. In 2011, . two of the charges were overturned on appeal, and he was re-sentenced . to 42 months in prison on one count of mail fraud and on the one count . of obstruction of justice.

"Nigel Farage met Rupert Murdoch in his New York offices after filming interviews for some of the mogul's news channels, it has been revealed. The Ukip leader was summoned to Murdoch's NewsCorp Manhattan office after taping a segment for Fox News's Sean Hannity and Neil Cavuto shows. During an advertisement break, Cavuto turned to Farage and said: 'Sir, the boss wants to see you... the big boss,' it was reported. Scroll down for video . Nigel Farage, pictured in Edinburgh today, had a 'private conversation' with Rupert Murdoch after being called up to the media mogul's Manhattan office . Mr Murdoch's publications have been known to heavily endorse political parties, with the front page of The Sun condemning candidates such as Labour's Neil Kinnock in the 1992 General Election with a headline of: 'If Kinnock wins today will the last person to leave Britain please turn out the lights.' Breitbart London reports the leader was whisked upstairs for 'lengthy' talks following the brief exchange. The meeting comes after Douglas Carswell announced his leaving the Tories for UKIP, triggering a by-election in Clacton where he may become the first elected Ukip MP. A Ukip spokesman confirmed the encounter, describing it as a 'private conversation' between the two,'The Independent reports. In 2013 the outspoken party leader praised Mr Murdoch - whose many publications were heavily scrutinised in the wake of the phone hacking scandal - as a 'remarkable bloke' after being invited to his home for dinner. Rupert Murdoch's  publications have famously endorsed and condemned political parties in the past . Earlier this week pro-union campaigners begged Farage to stay away from Scotland ahead of the impending referendum. Plans for a rally on September  12 - six days before the historic vote - were met frostily by some who fear his presence in Glasgow will deter Labour enthusiasts from voting against Scottish independence. Last night, Murdo Fraser, a Tory member of the Scottish Parliament, said: ‘I think it would be best if Nigel Farage stayed as far away from Scotland as possible. 'The arguments for staying in the UK are strong. The majority of Scots are on our side and we don’t need a distraction at this point.’ But Ukip’s Scottish chairman, Arthur Thackeray, dismissed calls for Mr Farage to stay away as ‘absolute, complete and utter nonsense’. He said: ‘We are a mainstream party and Nigel as our leader is coming up in support of a No vote.’","Ukip leader ushered to media mogul's office while taping interviews .

"Dropped the case: The court-appointed guardian, Maria Schimer, who is also a registered nurse, has dropped her attempt to force Amish girl, Sarah Hershberger, 11, to have chemotherapy treatment . A court was wrong to appoint a guardian to make medical decisions for an Amish girl whose parents stopped her chemotherapy against doctors' wishes, the family's attorney said in court filings this week. The lawyer for Sarah Hershberger's family, who have fled their Medina County home so the 11-year-old wouldn't be forced to have treatment, argued that the guardian be allowed to resign. Ohio's guardianship statutes appear to let courts substitute their judgment for that of suitable parents while ignoring the parents' 'moral and constitutional interests,' Maurice Thompson wrote in his filing with the Ninth District Court of Appeals in Akron. The court should take a narrower view that limits such second-guessing and is consistent with constitutional safeguards of their rights, he wrote. To do that, the court must hold 'that the decisions of suitable parents may not be attacked by anyone anytime in an Ohio Probate Court, and that these careful and gut-wrenching life and death decisions cannot be second-guessed and overruled where the parents are suitable, and simply seek to try a less invasive treatment first,' wrote Thompson, who leads the libertarian 1851 Center for Constitutional Law in Ohio. Clair Dickinson, an attorney for guardian Maria Schimer, said Thursday that he will submit a response to Thompson's filing later, but he declined to reveal what it might say. Hershberger and her parents fled their home more than two months ago so she wouldn't be forced to resume chemotherapy for her leukemia. Instead, they decided to use natural medicines, such as herbs and vitamins. Disappeared: The Hershbergers fled their farm in Homer Township, Ohio,  to avoid their daughter Sarah getting treatment, which they say is making her sick and are worried it will make her 'infertile' The Hershbergers shun many facets of modern life and are deeply religious. They have said they stopped chemotherapy not for religious reasons but . because it was making Sarah too sick and they feared it could end up . killing her. Doctors at . Akron Children's Hospital believe Sarah's leukemia is treatable but have . said she will die within a year without chemotherapy. Schimer, . an attorney who's also a registered nurse, has asked the court to let . her drop her attempt to force Sarah to resume chemotherapy, because it . became impossible to make medical decisions for Sarah after the family . fled. If approved by a . judge, Schimer's resignation could end the family's months-long fight . against the hospital and pave the way for them to return home, where . they live on a farm and operate a produce stand near the village of . Spencer, about 35 miles southwest of Cleveland. Medina . County Probate Judge Kevin Dunn has delayed a decision on the . resignation request. He said he first wants to make sure he has . authority to grant it in light of the ongoing appeal in state court. In . a separate filing on that issue this week, the family's lawyer argued . that Dunn should immediately accept the resignation and that it wouldn't . hinder the appeal. Dickinson . has said that an attorney told him the hospital won't continue its . legal push to get chemotherapy for Sarah if her guardian's resignation . is approved. Can be treated: Doctors at Akron Children's Hospital believe Sarah's leukemia is treatable, but say she will die within a year if she halts chemotherapy . Schimer dropped her attempt to force the child to resume chemotherapy earlier in December. The . guardian was given the power to make medical decisions for Sarah after . an appeals court ruling in October said the beliefs and convictions of . the girl's parents can't outweigh the rights of the state to protect the . child. But Schimer decided . to drop the effort because she doesn't know where Sarah is now and it . has become impossible to monitor her health or make any medical . decisions. 'It didn't make sense to drag this on any longer,' Dickinsonsaid. Sarah's . father said the family doesn't oppose modern medicine and that they . didn't make their decision based on religious reasons. They . end chemotherapy, he said, because it was taking too great of a toll on . their daughter and she feared the treatments would make her infertile. Sarah . and her parents left their home in rural northeast Ohio just days . before the state appeals court allowed the guardian to take over medical . decisions. The family left the country in late September before returning to an undisclosed location outside Ohio. Schimer's attempts to meet with the family were rebuffed, Dickinson said. Traditions: Sarah Hershberger (not pictured) and her family are Amish, and their beliefs force them to shun technology and in turn, some forms of modern medicine . The guardian's decision to withdraw from the case still needs final approval from a county court. 'The . judge's approval of this resignation will pave the way for the family's . return home, which will allow Sarah to receive the family's preferred . treatment under the best possible conditions,' Thompson said earlier. Sarah's . last known chemotherapy session was in June, but she has undergone . alternative-therapy treatments and is doing well, her family has said. Her grandfather, Issac Keim, told the Akron Beacon Journal that his granddaughter Sarah recently celebrated her 11th birthday and seems vibrant and healthy. According to Mr Keim, blood and imaging tests indicated that Sarah's cancer is gone. Thompson said the case came down to fundamental principles and constitutional rights. 'We made it clear to our opponents that they were in for a protracted battle,' he said. Andy Hershberger, the Ohio girl's . father, said this past summer that the family agreed to begin two years . of treatments for Sarah last spring but stopped a second round of . chemotherapy in June because it was making her extremely sick. Sarah begged her parents to stop the chemo and they agreed after a great deal of prayer, Hershberger said. The family, members of an insular Amish community, shuns many facets of modern life and is deeply religious. Hospital officials have said they are morally and legally obligated to make sure the girl receives proper care. They said the girl's illness, lymphoblastic lymphoma, is an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, but there is a high survival rate with treatment.","The lawyer for Sarah Hershberger's family, who have fled their Medina County, Ohio, home so the 11-year-old wouldn't be forced to have treatment, argued that the guardian be allowed to resign .

"People in their early fifties are the most unhappy in Britain, a study has found. Official figures show a ‘u-shape’ of happiness throughout the average lifetime, with youngsters and the retired at the top, while those in their late forties and early fifties languish at the bottom. The Office for National Statistics said people felt most miserable at the age when they often had most responsibilities, but still saw retirement as out of reach. Graph: The study found a 'u-shape' of happiness, with the young and the retired at the top, while those in their late forties and early fifties languished at the bottom . Regional differences: The latest study found varying levels of happiness across the country, with Northern Ireland scoring far higher than England, Scotland or Wales . As well as still working, many middle-aged people are stretched between the dual responsibilities of looking after children – who typically leave home much later – and elderly parents who are living longer but require more care. ‘There is a very strong age profile which shows that well-being dips when people are middle-aged,’ said Glenn Everett, director of the ONS Measuring National Well-being Programme. ‘Perhaps it is when you have got kids and a mortgage compared to when you are young and have fewer responsibilities. When people are nearing retirement, your well-being picks up again, which may be due to reduced responsibilities or greater contentment.’ The evidence of middle-aged misery was uncovered in a Government-funded well-being survey, which attempts to measure the nation’s life satistfaction. According to the findings, happiness generally falls after the age of 19, a time when university and establishing a career beckons. It doesn’t rise again until  people reach their late fifties. Then it continues to increase until age 75, after which it dips slightly. But it’s not all bad news. The survey of 165,000 people found Britons are more satisfied with their lives than at any time  since 2011. ' When people are nearing . retirement, your well-being picks up again, which may be due to reduced . responsibilities or greater contentment' Anxiety levels have also fallen, while happiness and feelings that life is worthwhile have increased. The ONS said people appeared to be feeling more positive about the economy as a result of falling unemployment rates. Dawn Snape, one of the co-authors of the report, said: ‘The unemployment rate has a profound impact on happiness. Not only does it affect the people who are unemployed, but also those people around them.’ Although wages are currently rising at just half the rate of inflation, she said many could see ‘the light at the end of the tunnel’. ‘They are starting to feel their finances are getting better even when, objectively, we know that is not the case,’ she said. Nothern Ireland is the happiest place to live Scotland comes in third . Maybe it's because I'm a Londoner that I'm the saddest in the UK . Prime Minister David Cameron ordered the annual research, first published in 2012, after deciding the Government should be informed about quality of life. Previously criticised for producing predictable results, the £1.5million-a-year inquiry into Britain’s national well-being measures everything from job satisfaction to levels of depression. The personal well-being section – which asks four questions about happiness, life satisfaction, anxiety and whether life is worthwhile – costs £200,000 alone. The latest study found happiness levels varied across different parts of the UK. The five happiest places were Antrim, Fermanagh, Omagh and Dungannon in Northern Ireland, and Babergh in Suffolk. The most miserable areas were Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, Dartford in Kent, Torridge in Devon, Maldon in Essex, and South Ribble in Lancashire. GROWN-UP children who can’t afford to fly the nest may well be adding to the stress of their middle-aged parents. But there is still a great deal of joy to be found in raising a family – with stay-at-home mothers among the happiest people in the UK. Research by the Office for National Statistics found those who looked after family instead of working – a group dominated by women – were more likely to describe their lives as ‘worthwhile’ than the employed. Stay-at-home parents and carers gave an average score of 8.03 out of ten when asked if they felt what they did was worthwhile, compared to 7.85 for workers, 7.92 for retired people and 7.73 for students. They were also happier than employed people, scoring 7.46 compared with 7.43. Marie Peacock, chairman of campaign group Mothers at Home Matter, told the Mail: ‘We are not surprised by the research which shows that people are enjoying being at home with their family. ‘There is an enormous amount of pleasure to be gained from raising a family, and it would be wonderful if politicians would recognise in their policies that there is a yearning for people to spend time with their children.’ The survey also found married people to be happier than cohabiting couples. Those who were married or in civil partnerships scored 7.66 out of ten, while partners living together rated themselves as 7.37. Single people lagged behind with a score of 7.14, while divorcees were least cheerful at 6.9. The findings echo an Open University study earlier this year, which concluded that although married people have greater doubts than unmarried couples about the quality of their relationship, they are more content.","Survey attempts to measure people's happiness and satisfaction with life .

"A new biography of Vladimir Putin paints a picture of the Russian president as a 'traumatised' man and speculates that he might be homosexual. Moscow political scientist Stanislav Belkovsky's book 'Putin' claim the rumoured affair between the president and an Olympic gymnast was an invention by his PR team and that he might be 'latently gay' The book also claims that the 61-year-old president finds sex 'alien' and that he prefers animals over humans. Rumours: A new biography of Vladimir Putin claims the Russian president may be 'latently gay' Biography: The book claims Putin 'flees from people' in order to spend time in nature with his dogs . Belkovsky has outraged the Kremlin with his book in which he portrays the ruler of the largest country on earth as the weak son of an alcoholic. Belkovsky says the key to understanding Vladimir Putin lies in his childhood. He writes: ‘The small Vladimir, who grew up practically without a father and without the love and care of his parents, was a withdrawn and grim child. 'Putin was born the son of an alcoholic two years before his official birth date. His mother had moved to Georgia with Vladimir, only for the child to be shunted off to Leningrad a short time later to the couple who would become the official parents of the future president.’ According to Belkovsky, Putin has spent his life in search of a ‘surrogate family.’ He names Boris Yeltsin as Putin's surrogate father and in Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich, an orphan, he found a brother. Staged romance: Belkovsky claims the president's affair with former gymnast Alina Kabaeva was staged by his PR team . 'Orphan': The autobiography claims that Putin was a 'grim' child who grew up without the love of his parents and found a surrogate father in Boris Yeltsin . He calls Putin a ‘deeply lonely politician’ who prefers animals to people, and adds that the macho photos of him with topless tigers and bears are not staged. ’Therein lies the real Putin,’ argues Belkovsky. ‘He flees from people and his obligations to nature. 'Here we have Vladimir's best friends; the Labrador Conny and the Bulgarian shepherd dog Buffy, his only roommates in the presidential residence.’ Belkovsky says that Kremlin image-polishers continually pump out stories about his sexual prowess and claims his alleged affair with beautiful former gymnast and Olympic champion Alina Kabaeva was an invention of his PR team. He says: ‘Sex and a sex life to him are alien,’ and he speculates that he may be ‘latently gay.’ The lives of Putin's two daughters, Mariya, 28, and 27-year-old Ekaterina, are scrutinised too in the book. His flock: The book claims that Putin is closer to animals than he is to humans, and that his best friends are in fact his two dogs . Spiegel magazine in Germany, which reviewed it this week, said: ‘Mariya was romantically involved with a Dutch architect. When he was forced into a ditch by the armoured motorcade of a Moscow banker, it took only 15 minutes for the culprits to be arrested. ‘The commander of this lightning-speed operation was later appointed interior minister by Putin, while the banker, who was immediately sentenced to seven years in prison, now 'has adequate opportunity to reflect on the quiet Dutch architect,' Belkovsky wrote.’ Yekaterina lives with the son of Nikolai Shamalov, a longtime Putin pal who mediates between Russian bureaucrats and western businessmen in lucrative deals in the medical industry. Belkovsky claims that the daughters and their partners benefit enormously thanks to the power of their father. Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov thundered: ‘Belkovsky's remarks are lacking any basis, or as we say it in Russia: They are total rubbish.’","New biography claims Vladimir Putin might be 'latently gay'

"The British nurse who survived Ebola has returned to the country where he caught the deadly virus. William Pooley said he was 'delighted' to help other British medics in Sierra Leone in a bid to prevent 'as many unnecessary deaths as possible'. The 29-year-old, who was treated with an experimental drug out of most victims' reach, flew out tonight despite uncertainty over whether he is immune to the disease. Scroll down for video . Returning to help: British Ebola survivor William Pooley flew back to Sierra Leone tonight to help other victims . Stricken: The virus has claimed almost 1,000 lives in Sierra Leone. Pictured: Medics in the capital Freetown . Although it is widely assumed the same person cannot develop Ebola twice, that has never been proven conclusively by scientists. The scale of the current epidemic - with already 16 times more deaths than the previous most fatal outbreak in 1976 - could provide the first test to that theory. The Suffolk-born nurse will arrive in Sierra Leone, where 932 people have died of Ebola, and resume work tomorrow in an isolation unit run at Freetown's Connaught Hospital by British medics. He had to wait until the government replaced his passport - because his previous one was incinerated along with the rest of his belongings. 'I would like to once again thank the team at the Royal Free Hospital and the RAF who provided me with such excellent treatment and support,' he said in a statement. Isolation: Mr Pooley was flown back to Britain in August in an isolation chamber before treatment in London . Despite uncertainty over his immunity, Mr Pooley said he had to attend to the 'real emergency' in West Africa . 'But the real emergency is in West Africa, and the teams out there need all the support we can give them. 'I am now looking forward to getting back out there and doing all I can to prevent as many unnecessary deaths as possible.' He will join staff from King’s Health Partners team, a partnership between King’s College London and three NHS trusts - Guy’s and St Thomas’, King’s College Hospital and South London and Maudsley. Mr Pooley became the first confirmed Briton to contract Ebola and was flown home in August to be treated in a specially-adapted unit at the Royal Free Hospital, north London. He was treated with the experimental drug ZMapp, supplies of which have been extremely limited. After he was given the all-clear the nurse agreed to donate his blood plasma, which contains antibodies vital to combating the disease, in a bid to develop treatment for victims. Dr Oliver Johnson, programme director for the King’s Sierra Leone Partnership, said: 'It is fantastic that Will has chosen to join our small team here at Connaught Hospital. 'The situation here in Freetown is getting worse by the day and so Will’s experience and commitment will be vital as we do everything we can to stem the flow of cases. 'The best way of stopping Ebola spreading even further is to fight it at its source and I look forward to working with Will to do just that.' Earlier this week Mr Pooley said he was preparing to return to West Africa to help deal with the Ebola epidemic because it is 'something I need to do'. Help on the way: The 574ft British hospital ship RFA Argus set sail for Sierra Leone from Falmouth on Friday . Speaking in Whitehall in central London, he said he knew his family and friends would be worried but they should be reassured by his potential immunity to the virus. 'There is still a lot of work to do out there and I am in the same or better position than when I chose to go out before,' Mr Pooley said. 'I know my mum and dad are worried but they support me because they know this is something I have to do. 'My potential immunity is very reassuring for them, or at least it should be, and I will be returning in a more organised fashion than when I was out there originally.' More than 4,500 people have died from Ebola, mainly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Britain’s latest Ebola aid flight carrying vital medical supplies landed in Freetown yesterday, International Development Secretary Justine Greening said. It was the UK’s sixth aid flight and carried almost £900,000 worth of medical equipment needed for the 92 bed treatment facility in Kerry Town, including blood banks, centrifuges and protective equipment such as goggles and gloves. On Friday a British hospital ship with 100 beds set sail for Sierra Leone from Falmouth, Cornwall, after the crew spent a week loading medical supplies. The 574ft RFA Argus, which has a full emergency department, resuscitation and surgical facilities, a radiology suite with a CT scanner, a critical care unit, a high dependency unit and a 70-bed general ward, will be joined by 750 servicemen and three Merlin helicopters.","William Pooley was flown home from Sierra Leone and treated in London .

"Sports pundit and former-England footballer Michael Gray has undergone the first UK hair transplant to be streamed live on the internet. Some 22,000 people with strong stomachs watched Dr Bessam Farjo perform the surgery, which began at 10am yesterday morning and finished at 6.50pm. Tweeting after his procedure Mr Gray, 37, from Sunderland, said: 'Well what a day I've had 2day. Head is a little sore right now but worth it. Thankyou to @BessamFarjo and his lovely team.' Dr Farjo took more than 5,000 healthy hair follicles from the back of Mr Gray's head and implanted them at the front of the scalp after making hundreds of incisions. The TV presenter also answered questions via Twitter during the procedure. Michael Gray checks out his new look with Dr Bessam Farjo after the seven-hour operation . Dr Bessam Farjo reveals where he has brought Mr Gray's hairline forward . Mr Gray, who played for premiership teams including Sunderland, Blackburn Rovers and Sheffield Wednesday during his career, noticed he was receding when he was about 27. After seeing other celebrities such as Wayne Rooney undergo the procedure, he decided to go under the knife. 'I think it's more acceptable now and that was one of the reasons that I wanted to go through with it,' he said before the operation. 'Cosmetic surgery now is an everyday occurrence. People might be out there and may be worried about the operation and if I'm going to get it done then why not let people see it. 'There's a lot of people out there who are worried about it. Here they can see it from start to finish.' He said the transplant would help improve his confidence. 'I'm working in the media at the moment and doing quite a lot of the TV and when I watch myself back I'm conscious about the way I look, so from the confidence side of things I'm hoping that will beat that. 'People refer to the harrowing experience a woman must go through when losing her hair, however it can be equally upsetting for men, who can suffer from a severe loss of self-esteem. 'I hope the live broadcast will help us to educate people about hair transplant surgery and open up discussions around the solutions available to those experiencing hair loss.' The transplant involves taking 3,500-4,000 hairs from the back and sides of his head and ""re-planting"" them into his receding hairline, said Dr Farjo. Mr Gray said he was looking forward to seeing his transformation this afternoon . How the surgery is appearing online . Prepared: Dr Bessam Farjo with former England footballer Michael Gray who doesn't like his receding hairline . Early on during the surgery when Dr Farjo took hair follicles from the back of Mr Gray's head . The surgeon, in his 19th year of carrying out hair transplants, said: 'Think about it as similar to gardening. We're removing bulbs of hair from one part of the scalp to another but we can't pluck it out, we have to move it with the bed around it, like soil. 'As long as you keep it alive, keep it in its soil, it picks up again.' The procedure involved a team of two doctors and eight nursing technicians. After the operation, the hair will start to gradually grow and the full results will be seen in eight to 12 months, he said. Dr Farjo, medical director of the Institute of Trichologists, said hair transplants have become more common as views on cosmetic surgery have changed and more celebrities have undergone the operation. 'Obviously 20 years ago people generally had a different attitude or feeling about things like cosmetic surgery and lifestyle issues, it was very much not talked about. It's a far cry from where we are now,' he said. Michael Gray (right), pictured here in 2006 playing for Blackburn against Robbie Keane's Tottenham, was known for his flowing blonde locks . However, he said many people still have questions: 'No matter how much information they arm themselves with it's hard for them to imagine what it's like. 'They say a picture speaks a thousand words and it's basically like that. 'I believe this is the first time a surgeon has attempted to broadcast a hair transplant live in the UK.' The event was hosted by Brian Beacom - author of Diary of a Hair Transplant: A Journalist's Search for David Cassidy Hair. Dr Farjo added: 'Our broadcast is intended to orchestrate a pioneering moment for the hair loss community, as well as the surgical field, giving the nation a first-hand look at the procedure and helping to dispel misconceptions around hair transplant surgery.'

"Britain is bankrolling EU institutions at a record £20billion a year, undermining David Cameron’s efforts to slash the Brussels budget. The net contribution of UK taxpayers to the European Union has soared by an inflation-busting 13 per cent in one year. Latest figures show that the gap between what the UK handed Brussels and what it got back has now reached £12.2billion in 2012, up from £10.8billion in 2011. Efforts undermined: Prime Minister David Cameron (pictured in Brussels in May) has insisted that Britain will be £600million better off this year, having argued for a cut in EU spending at a summit in February . Britain received only £7.78billion from Brussels – the lowest return in a decade thanks to the eurozone crisis, according to the Office for National Statistics. Since the economic downturn began, the UK’s contribution to the EU has doubled. And the figures do not include an extra £1.4billion which the Government was forced to hand over to the European Investment Bank in March. The Prime Minister has insisted that Britain will be £600million better off this year, having argued for a cut in EU spending at a summit in February. However, the Treasury’s bill alone for EU membership has more than trebled in the last decade, increasing from £2.9million to £9.5billion in 2012. James Harvard, of campaign group Get Britain Out, said: ‘We’re often told that one of the benefits of EU membership is the grants and payments that it makes to Britain. ‘But these figures expose the truth: For every pound we receive from Brussels, we’ve first had to give them more than two. 'Cut our losses': Godfrey Bloom, a UKIP MEP, said the figures showed the EU was bad value for Britain 'as we close our A&Es, cut defence, cut police and raise tax' ‘When public services are being cut to save money at home, it’s frankly offensive that the EU pocketed an additional £1.4billion last year. It’s 1.4billion further reasons for us to leave.’ Godfrey Bloom, a UKIP MEP, said the figures showed the EU was bad value for Britain ‘as we close our A&Es, cut defence, cut police and raise tax’. 'For every pound we receive from Brussels, we’ve first had to give them more than two' James Harvard, Get Britain Out . He said: ‘No matter how hard the Government try to spin it we are paying more for the EU and getting less. It is time to cut our losses and leave as soon as possible.’ Tory MP Mark Reckless said: ‘I was accused of scaremongering when I said our EU budget contribution was set to hit £20billion but now it has gone over that. ‘If we left the EU and it were mad enough not to agree a free trade area, the £20billion plus saved could pay the cost of any tariffs three times over.’ Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan added: ‘Last year, the Government made austerity savings of around £8.6billion. These are, in effect, all wiped out and more by the net contribution to Brussels.’ A Treasury spokesman said: ‘As the Prime . Minister told Parliament in his European Council statement last . February, the last government gave away almost half of our rebate. Troubled: The IMF revealed that an extra £8.8billion would be needed in 2014 and 2015 to bail out Greece. The black hole will open up from summer next year, when Greece's current financing arrangement runs out . 'This has had a long-term and continuing effect on the UK’s net contributions. Almost whatever budget deal was done in February, our net contributions were always likely to go up. ‘As a result of the deal that was done, though, they will be going up by less.’ 'I was accused of scaremongering when I said our EU budget contribution was set to hit £20billion but now it has gone over that' Mark Reckless, Tory MP . In a separate blow for the eurozone, the IMF yesterday revealed that an extra £8.8billion would be needed in 2014 and 2015 to bail out Greece. The black hole will open up from summer next year, when Greece’s current financing arrangement runs out. And a powerful Lords committee will today warn ministers that the eurozone is vulnerable to fresh crises. The EU sub-committee on economic and financial affairs has written to Greg Clark, Financial Secretary to the Treasury, expressing concern that European leaders were continuing to ‘muddle through’ the economic difficulties. It urged ministers to explain how the UK could continue to work within the evolving EU while remaining outside the single currency.","Gap between what UK handed Brussels and what it got back has risen .
It has now reached £12.2billion in 2012 - up from £10.8billion in 2011 .
Britain got only £7.78billion from Brussels - lowest return in decade .

"Savage attack: Cedric Brown is accused of attacking Mark Williams in his home so violently that paramedics could not tell what colour the victim's skin was because he was covered in blood . An armed robber attacked a man so savagely that paramedics could not see what colour his skin was because he was covered with blood, a  court has been told. Cedric Brown, 46, is accused of attacking wealthy stable owner Mark Williams, 51, with a knife in a terrifying burglary at his £600,000 farmhouse in Siston Common, near Bristol as Mr Williams tried to protect his wife Susan. Birmingham Crown Court heard how Brown and an accomplice allegedly slashed Mr Williams in the throat and stabbed him three times in the stomach before beating the family’s dogs so badly with walking sticks that they had to be put down. Mr Williams confronted the men during the raid on November 16, 2010 as one of the men held a knife to his 51-year-old wife's throat after she went to investigate a noise downstairs, the court heard. In giving evidence, Mr Williams described to the jury how he came face-to-face with the robbers in his home while the other restrained his wife. Mr Williams, who still bears visible scars from the attack on his neck, said: ‘I had been stabbed in the left side, . had a slash in my neck and slashes down either side of my face from . scalp to ear and there was a slash down my left eye. ‘I had squirted blood all over the ceiling from the cuts in my face and the floor was soaked, it was very wet. Anthony Potter, prosecuting, told the jury of seven women and five men that a hat covered in Brown's DNA was found at the scene of the crime. He said: ‘This wasn't just a run-of-the-mill burglary. It was aggravated by the fact that Brown was armed when he committed the burglary. ‘He wasn't simply armed. He used that . knife in a gratuitous and unnecessary attack on a householder who had . had the temerity to try and protect his wife, who was being attacked, . and his property. ‘They had gone to bed around 9pm when Mrs Williams heard their dogs making a lot of noise outside. ‘She went downstairs, dressed only in her pyjama top to see what was going on. ‘She saw two uninvited individuals at the bottom of the staircase, they were both black males one larger and short, the other tall and thin, it was clear to her the large one was in charge. ‘When Mr Williams heard noise of distress he also came downstairs, he didn't just find two uninvited males. He found an uninvited male who was by this point holding his wife. ‘He told them to leave, the man didn't take the invitation, he did quite the opposite. That man who we say is Cedric Brown slashed Mr Williams with the knife. ‘He slashed him in his neck and stabbed him in the stomach. Terrifying burglary: Birmingham Crown Court (pictured) heard how Brown and an accomplice allegedly slashed Mr Williams in the throat and stabbed him three times in the stomach . ‘He was stabbed so badly that when . paramedics arrived at the scene they said they couldn't tell what colour . his skin was. He was literally covered in blood.’ Giving . evidence from behind a screen, Mrs Williams, who is a hair stylist, . told the court they were attacked after they had gone to bed to watch . television. She said: ‘We . had just gone to bed and were just snuggling up to watch I'm a Celebrity . Get Me Out Of Here when I heard the dogs barking. ‘I went downstairs to see what was going on and thought it must be my daughter coming home. Mark Williams giving evidence in court . ‘Then through the window into the . kitchen I saw two men, one had a scarf wrapped round his head and the . other was wearing a dark sort of bobble hat. ‘One of them, the shorter man, saw me, grabbed me and put the knife to my throat. I screamed get out of my house, get out. ‘He said to me, “You have a daughter, go and get her.” I said, “She's not here, she's not here”. ‘My . husband came downstairs in his night wear and told them to get out, he . can sound quite aggressive but he's a little kitten really. ‘I think this took them aback, the chunky one lunged at him and they began to wrestle on the floor. Mrs Williams said her husband looked dazed and slipped in and out consciousness. She said: ‘I could see he had been stabbed in the side and his throat had been cut, there was a cut by his eye and blood on his face. ‘The chunky man kept shouting at me to get the safe. Then he said to me, “We kill people”, he said it like he was offering me a cup of tea. Crime scene: Anthony Potter, prosecuting, told the jury that a hat covered in Brown's DNA was found at the farmhouse after the attack . ‘He started coming toward me holding . this knife, it was between three and four inches long, bigger than one . you'd use for potatoes. ‘I just desperately thought about what money we had, and I remembered the takings I had brought home from the salon. ‘I told him there was money there and that seemed to satisfy the taller man but the chunky one just kept coming toward me.’ Mrs . Williams, who broke down and wept as she described fearing for her . life, said: ‘I dropped to my knees and prayed for him not to kill us. ‘He . spotted the cross I was holding from my necklace and grabbed it and . yanked it off my neck, that seemed to satisfy them and they left through . the back door. ‘They had been holding walking sticks from out utility room, and I believe they beat two of our dogs with them because we had to have them put down. ‘At one point I managed to escape and they grabbed me by my hair and yanked me back in using the hooks on the sticks. ‘I am certain that he would have killed us had I not remembered that money.’ Mr Williams told the court: ‘I went downstairs and spotted one man at the bottom of the stairs and the other holding my wife. ‘I shouted at them to leave but they didn't. He shouted back, “We're already in now”. We wrestled and the second man started hitting me with a walking stick. ‘I think by this time I had been stabbed as I was starting to lose energy. I must have been stabbed straight away. ‘I tried to get away into the next room, tried to push him back with the . door or trap him in it - but I had lost a lot of blood and was weak so . he overpowered me. By this time he was slashing me in the face as well. ""The chunkier man went upstairs and was desperately rummaging around. I thought we were going to die. They kept saying, ""Which bedroom is the safe in"" and ""Where's your daughter"". Brown denies one count of burglary of a dwelling and wounding with intent. The trial continues.

"A security company is offering free GPS devices to churches to help prevent their baby Jesus figurines being stolen from Nativity scenes. Brickhouse Security is giving the GPS trackers to qualifying churches to hide on or in their Jesus figurines. If baby Jesus is snatched by a sticky-fingered heathen, the matchbox-sized device will alert the owner to the theft. Crossing the line: Every year, baby Jesus figurines are stolen from church Nativity scenes . 'We monitor it from our cloud-based mapping system, and set up alerts so that they'll get a text message or an e-mail if Baby Jesus is in motion,' said Todd Morris, CEO of Brickhouse Securities. Brickhouse Security can then pinpoint Jesus' location whereupon law enforcement can undertake a rescue operation. Savior: The Brickhouse tracker means baby Jesus can be tracked on the company's cloud-based mapping system . Marc Horowitz, the editorial director for BrickHouse Security, told The Christian Post why his company is providing the device for free. 'Frankly, we designed this program to do something helpful... and the theft and vandalism of holiday stuff happens more than you might realize. It happens in community after community all over the country,' he said. This is the eighth year the company has offered the free program, called 'Save Jesus.' The program has been taken up by more and more churches every year. For St Mark's Episcopal Church in Glen Ellyn, Illinois, the offer of a free tracking device couldn't have come at a better time. 'Two of the Wise Men disappeared and ended up at Four Lakes Ski Resort,' explained Reverend George Smith to NBC. The church this year will use GPS tracking devices on all of its Nativity figurines to prevent another such theft. Heaven sent: The 'Save Jesus' program has been running for eight years to protect Church property during the festive season . 'Of course God knows where they are, but now maybe we have a better chance to know as well,' said Reverend Smith. 'It gives me great pleasure to report that in the history of the Saving Jesus program, no holiday display equipped with a BrickHouse Security GPS tracking system has ever been victimized by thieves,' said Morris. 'Maybe one day this program won't be necessary. But until that day comes, BrickHouse will keep doing its part to make the holiday season safer and more festive for everybody.'","Each year, baby Jesus figurines are stolen from Nativity scenes .

"Professor Richard Dawkins has claimed that forcing a religion on children without questioning its merits is as bad as 'child abuse'. In typically incendiary style, the leading atheist said he was against the 'indoctrination of religion' and teaching it as fact. The evolutionary scientist, speaking at the Chipping Norton Literary Festival yesterday, was repeating claims he made last year which were roundly condemned by charities and politicians. Incendiary claims: Prof Dawkins said that teaching a child that they are Catholic or Muslim is as bad as 'child abuse' Professor Dawkins said at the festival that children should be taught religion but scorn should be poured on its claims. 'What a child should be taught is that religion exists; that some people believe this and some people believe that,' the Daily Telegraph reported he had said. 'What a child should never be taught is that you are a Catholic or Muslim child, therefore that is what you believe. That's child abuse.' He added that teaching children religion would help them understand literature. Professor Dawkins, a biologist who revolutionised the theory of evolution with his 1976 book The Selfish Gene, added that he thought it was still important to teach children about different faiths. Religion critic: Prof Dawkins' bestseller The God Delusion . 'There is a value in teaching children about religion. You cannot really appreciate a lot of literature without knowing about religion. But we must not indoctrinate our children,' he said. The former Oxford professor - who has been condemned as attention-seeking and unhelpful by critics - said last December that the mental torment inflicted by the religion’s teachings is worse in the long-term than any sexual abuse carried out by priests. Prof Dawkins' best-selling book The God Delusion argues that belief in a supernatural creator is irrational and harmful to society. In the earlier interview, he claimed  he had been told by a woman that while being abused by a priest was a ‘yucky’ experience, being told as a child that a Protestant friend who died would ‘roast in Hell’ was more distressing. In remarks to Qatar-based TV network Al Jazeera, he said: ‘Horrible as sexual abuse no doubt was, the damage was arguably less than the long-term psychological damage inflicted by bringing the child up Catholic in the first place.’ Interviewer Mehdi Hasan asked: ‘You believe that being bought up as a Catholic is worse than being abused by a priest?’. Professor Dawkins replied: ‘There are shades of being abused by a priest, and I quoted an example of a woman in America who wrote to me saying that when she was seven years old she was sexually abused by a priest in his car. ‘At the same time a friend of hers, also seven, who was of a Protestant family, died, and she was told that because her friend was Protestant she had gone to Hell and will be roasting in Hell forever. ‘She told me of those two abuses,  she got over the physical abuse; it was yucky but she got over it. ‘But the mental abuse of being told about Hell, she took years to get over.’","He said children should be taught 'religion exists' but not taught it as fact .

"TV host Mårten Andersson, 40, is launching the club night in Stockholm this September called SOBER . It's the same story every Saturday and Sunday morning as millions of Brits wake up nursing stupendous hangovers. 12 hours earlier as punters in bars, nightclubs and restaurants they will have been queuing up to hand over their hard-earned cash in return for enough booze to get drunk out of their minds. Now one man is hoping to change this centuries-old tradition with the invention of a new type watering hole: an alcohol-free nightclub. Mårten Andersson, 40, is launching a club night in Stockholm this September called SOBER, that will only stock soft drinks and promises to bar entry to drunk guests. The Swedish TV host and comedian decided to launch the evening to help people change their relationship with alcohol. He came up with the idea after quitting alcohol himself seven months ago. He told the MailOnline: 'I love what happened to me when I stopped drinking - I had been talking about doing it for some time, because I had started to feel anxiety when I drank. 'Then I was out partying one weekend, got too drunk and just decided to take a break. 'It was only supposed to be for a month, but then I realised that on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday I was usually still feeling the effects of a hangover, so I was basically wasting half of my week. 'I'm not an alcoholic, so I will probably drink again at some point because I really enjoy the taste of wine, but my attitude to drinking has now changed.' Mårten now socialises completely without alcohol and reckons he has never had a better time - dancing more and having more confidence to meet people when he goes out. He is convinced that there are many more people like him, who would enjoy clubbing without being under the influence, they just don't know it yet. He said: 'Around 95 per cent of the people who I've told about my idea have been really positive, but they are also very curious about a lot of things, like how it would work financially and whether it will be boring, or will people dance. 'Well I can tell you that I have never danced so much as I do now that I am sober. 'And each time you go out without drinking, you come home and realise that you have become more confident in doing things like talking to people. Late-night drunken queasiness could soon be a thing of the past if alcohol-free club nights catch on . 'Because you no longer need the alcohol for confidence - you can do it on its own.' The theory is that we really only get drunk most of the time out of habit, because we are so used to drinking alcohol with social activities that it becomes second nature. Mårten said: 'If you want to drink, then drink. But don't just do it on auto-pilot because it's what you have always done. 'I just made a change because my therapist said that we often associate everything with alcohol. 'So going to a football game - you drink, going bowling - you drink, meeting up with friends - you drink. 'This club is a way of making people discover themselves without those toxins.' Mårten is going out of his way to make sure that the club night won't feel like one of the main elements is lacking, with bartenders and mixologists creating and sourcing all of the alcohol-free drinks so that they will hopefully taste just as good as normal alcoholic beverages. He said: 'If you're a person who doesn't drink alcohol normally, you're doomed to second class drinks. The SOBER club night will provide alcohol-free drinks that aim to taste as good as normal boozy beverages like wine, beer and champagne . 'You get these horrible sugary juices or a lemonade and lime fizzy thing that is so boring, because you are no use to the bar if you are not drinking because they won't make any money out of you. 'But we are going to focus on lovingly made alcohol-free drinks - you can get some great beers and cocktails that don't need alcohol. 'There is even great tasting alcohol-free champagne that comes in a beautiful bottle, so you will still have all of the extras that usually would come with the alcohol. 'And it will be exactly like a normal club, with great DJ's, good music, good drinks, a nice venue and maybe even go-go dancers, it just won't have drunk people in it.' And if it's so good that drunk people want to also try and get in, they won't be allowed. Mårten believes the dance floor at his SOBER club night will be even more packed than a normal club. He said: 'I dance more now than I ever used to when i was drinking.' Bouncers on the door will be given breathalysers to weed out any punters who deny they've been on the sauce and anyone who does manage to sneak in will be booted out if discovered. Mårten said: 'That may sound a bit harsh, but if they are drinking then they can go to any of the other 99.9 per cent of clubs available that do sell alcohol. 'This is a place for people who don't want people drunkenly coming on to them or bumping into them. 'To be honest though, if they were drunk I don't think they would want to come in because they would feel stupid, they would be the only ones who were and everyone would be looking at them.' If anyone is doubting whether the night will be a success, they only need to look at the number of tickets sold for the first event on September 26 at Kägelbanan in Stockholm. 600 of the 750 tickets available have already sold out, with five weeks to go. Early morning club workout sessions called 'Morning Glory' where music-lovers are encouraged to rave their way into the day . The trend for raves without booze are building in popularity in the UK too, with early morning dance club workouts called 'Morning Glory' having huge success in London. Although whether the events would have the same popularity if they took place at night is yet to be seen. Mårten said: 'The world is ready for an alternative, there are a lot of us who would enjoy going out without being surrounded by p****heads. 'And if it is a success, this isn't just going to be a club night, it will hopefully be bigger than that. 'SOBER will hopefully be a whole project, an inspiration. 'I'd like to see it as a community, where we could do lectures and try to inspire people to start thinking about how they are drinking and also how they live their lives. 'Then maybe start a restaurant without alcohol, that is fair trade and ecological. I have connections in the UK too through my comedy work, so I could always try it there too.' Carefree raving is easy after one too many mojitos, but what about when you're sober? Writer TONI JONES tried the new urban fitness trend for health and beauty siteGetTheGloss.com. Toni and her friend George Bear raving their way into the day . She says: 'It's not unheard of for me to find myself in the middle of a sweaty dance floor as the sun comes up. Some of my best memories involve dancing till dawn with my most glamorous gal pals. What is unheard of is for me to be doing it completely sober. 'Morning Gloryville is billed as an 'immersive morning experience' encouraging dance fans to rave their way into the day, without drink, drugs or judgement. The team behind the 'conscious clubbing' movement claim that a dance-based, totally clean wake-up call is the most fun way to work out and get endorphins flowing. 'On the day, after a slow-ish start where the amount of harem pants and bongos had me worried that the sober scene was a little too alternative for me, my friends and I surprised ourselves by really getting into the swing of things. 'By 8am the dance floor was packed with glamorous young (ish) men and women raving their heads off to noughties dance anthems and the crowd seemed better looking than average (which was probably more to do with the fact they were at the start of their day not the end rather than the non-drinking aspect), everyone had a big grin on their faces, and we worked up a real sweat bouncing around. 'One problem with morning raving (sober or drunk) is trying to make yourself office appropriate in a nightclub loo. And I'm not sure Morning Glory would work at the weekend if trying to compete with real booze-addled after parties. But it's definitely a fun way to work out, and a great excuse to wear sequins before 9am.'","Bar will be stocked with range of alcohol-free champagne, beer and cocktails .

"A 466 mile-long chasm on the same scale as parts of the Grand Canyon has been discovered beneath the Greenland ice sheet. The canyon, which is as deep as 800 metres in places, is thought to predate the ice sheet, which has itself been around for millions of years. It has the characteristics of a meandering river channel, although it dwarfs the UK’s largest river, the Severn, which is less than half the length and far more shallow. Scroll down for video . The canyon, which is as deep as 800 metres in places, is thought to predate the ice sheet, which has itself been around for millions of years. It can be seen in the centre of this 3D visualisation of the Greenland bedrock for the northern half of the island . The canyon was found after scientists analysed radar signals collected by Nasa and researchers from the UK and Germany over several decades. At certain frequencies, ice is transparent to radio waves which can bounce off the bedrock underneath, according to a group of international researchers who published their findings in the journal Science. By analysing all the radar data the team discovered a continuous bedrock canyon that extends from the centre of the island and ends at its northern extremity in a deep fjord connecting to the Arctic ocean. Professor Jonathan Bamber, of Bristol . University’s School of Geographical Sciences, said: 'With Google . Streetview available for many cities around the world and digital maps . for everything from population density to happiness one might assume . that the landscape of the Earth has been fully explored and mapped. 'Our research shows there’s still a lot left to discover.' The researchers believe the canyon plays . an important role in transporting sub-glacial meltwater produced at the . bed from the interior to the edge of the ice sheet and ultimately into . the ocean. In August, a 466 mile-long (750 km) chasm on the same scale as parts of the Grand Canyon was discovered beneath the Greenland ice sheet. The canyon, which is as deep as 2,620ft (800m) in places, is thought to predate the ice sheet, which has itself been around for millions of years . Even before the presence of the ice sheet, going back at least four million years, the evidence suggests the canyon provided a pathway for water from the interior to the coast. Professor David Vaughan, ice2sea co-ordinator based at the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge said: 'A discovery of this nature shows that the Earth has not yet given up all its secrets. 'A 750km canyon preserved under the ice for millions of years is a breathtaking find in itself, but this research is also important in furthering our understanding of Greenland’s past. The researchers believe the canyon plays an important role in transporting sub-glacial meltwater produced at the bed from the interior to the edge of the ice sheet and ultimately into the ocean . 'This area’s ice sheet contributes to sea level rise and this work can help us put current changes in context.' Some of the data used in the study came from Nasa’s Operation IceBridge, which is a six-year mission and the largest airborne survey of Earth’s polar ice ever flown. Michael Studinger, a scientist working on the project based at Nasa Goddard Space Flight Centre said: 'Two things helped lead to this discovery. Scientist Michael Studinger said: 'It is quite remarkable that a 750km-long channel the size of parts of the Grand Canyon is discovered in the 21st century below the Greenland Ice Sheet (pictured). It shows how little we still know about the bedrock below large continental ice sheets' 'It was the enormous amount of data collected by IceBridge and the work of combining it with other datasets into a Greenland-wide compilation of all existing data that makes this feature appear in front of our eyes.

"A string of police blunders meant a psychiatric patient and convicted killer remained free to commit murder. Just before knifing a woman to death, Nicola Edgington rang 999 four times from a hospital begging to be arrested. A simple check would have told officers that she had stabbed her mother to death in 2005, but no-one accessed the Police National Computer and a crucial opportunity to section her under the Mental Health Act was missed. Scroll down for video . Sentenced: Nicola Edgington, left, has been jailed for 37 years after murdering Sally Hodkin, right, and attempting to murder Kerry Clark in a street attack in south east London in 2011 . Three hours later, she stabbed Sally Hodkin, 58, with such force that the accounts manager was almost beheaded. A second woman, Kerry Clark, 22, managed to fight Edgington off. Yesterday Mrs Hodkin’s grieving . husband told of his fury that the 32-year-old was freed to strike again . in October 2011, six years after killing her mother. Paul Hodkin said his wife and their . 40-year marriage were ‘wiped out in seconds by someone who should not . have been on the streets’. Victims: Mrs Hodkin (left) was in Bexleyheath when she was attacked by Edgington, suffering horrific injuries. Kerry Clark (right) was also attacked by Nicola Edgington in Bexleyheath in October 2011 . He is considering legal action after . the ‘chronic failures’ meant Edgington was allowed to walk out of a . hospital in Woolwich, South-East London. The Hodkin family said the tragedy highlighted fears about the treatment of dangerous offenders in the community. Yesterday a report by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) highlighted serious failings in the case, including: . Nicola Edgington is pictured boarding a bus toward Bexleyheath where she attacked Mrs Hodkin and Miss Clark . CCTV footage shows Edgington fleeing the scene after she killed Sally Hodkin in the street . Edgington is seen on CCTV being arrested by police after the murder in October 2011 . IPCC commissioner Sarah Green said it . was of ‘great concern’ that police did not carry out a computer check. ‘Nicola Edgington had a violent history linked to her mental health . problems and was evidently aware that she was a threat to others. ‘She made repeated phone calls to . police asking to be sectioned under the Mental Health Act and warned . officers in person of the risk she posed to those around her. ‘While our investigation found that no . police officers or staff breached the code of conduct, it is of great . concern that no Police National Computer check was carried out which . would have immediately alerted them to Edgington’s violent history.’ It has also emerged that the Oxleas . NHS Trust, which recommended Edgington’s release in 2009, has cared for . 12 other patients who went on to kill. Oxleas chief executive Stephen . Firn said none of the other killings had involved random attacks on . strangers, and the trust said the numbers were not disproportionately . high in comparison to other London mental health trusts. Edgington, a former private school . pupil, was ordered to be detained indefinitely under the Mental Health . Act after killing her mother. But she was released after a . recommendation for her to be discharged into the community was . rubber-stamped by the Ministry of Justice. The mother of two spiralled . into ‘freefall relapse’, and in October 2011, she dialled 999 and told . police: ‘The last time I was feeling like this, I killed someone. I . killed my mum.’ Sally Hodkin's sons Len, left, and Ian, right, are pictured arriving at the Old Bailey for the sentencing of their mother's killer Nicola Edgington . She was allowed to walk out of the . hospital and catch a bus to Bexleyheath, Kent, where she bought a £2 . kitchen Asda knife and launched a terrifying attack on Miss Clark. Edgington then stole a 12-inch butcher’s knife and killed Mrs Hodkin. In the Old Bailey, she was given a . double life sentence for the murder of Mrs Hodkin, and the attempted . murder of Miss Clark, and was told she would serve a minimum of 37 . years. The former prostitute and pole dancer had attempted to blame her . actions on paranoid schizophrenia, and asked the court to accept a . guilty plea to manslaughter with diminished responsibility. But prosecutors produced evidence that . her diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia was wrong and that she should . be convicted of murder. Trial judge the Recorder of London . Brian Barker said: ‘You are manipulative and exceptionally dangerous. You made your choice and the fact is these were terrible acts for which . you must take responsibility.’ When Sally Hodkin left home for the last time, her mind was full of her perfect holiday with her husband Paul (pictured right). The hard-working couple had enjoyed a week together in Norfolk and had returned to their home in Bexleyheath, Kent, just two days earlier. Mrs Hodkin left the house early so she could catch up with her work as an accounts manager at a law firm. It was a decision that took her into the path of killer Nicola Edgington, who launched a brutal and unprovoked attack on the grandmother. Yesterday her grieving husband said: ‘My life changed on October 10, 2011. My life fell apart.' Her family say that they are considering taking legal action over the failure of authorities to take Nicola Edgington off the streets. In a statement read out on behalf of the family by lawyer Daniel Rubenstein outside court, the family said: 'While we are relieved that a very dangerous woman has been taken off the street, we remain concerned at the very many questions that remain over the actions of the authorities and an alleged failure to treat clearly dangerous people in a secure environment.

"Images of the Arctic ice shelf cracking up are an icon of the damage wrought by global warming. But a team of researchers from the Universite Laval in Canada have found evidence that one ice shelf might have broken up before, 1,400 years ago – long before industrialisation had any impact on the planet. A study of sedimentary material on the bottom of Disraeli Fjord in Canada, found evidence of what the team described as a ‘major fracturing event’ 1,400 years ago. Scientists believe the Ward Hunt ice shelf north of Ellesmere Island, Nunavut, Canada, broke up and then re-froze 800 years ago . They believe at least one ice shelf, Ward Hunt north of Ellesmere Island, Nunavut, Canada, the largest remaining ice shelf in the Arctic at 170 square miles, broke up and then re-froze 800 years ago. Ice shelves are thick platforms of ice which have been pushed out to see by the pressure from glaciers. They act as dams in fjords and result in sediment building up at the boundary between fresh water from the ice and salt water from the ocean. Researchers used carbon dating and other techniques to examine the sediment and were able to create a timeline of events. They found the ice shelf appeared 4,000 years ago staying whole for several thousand years before fracturing 1,400 years ago. They said it didn't fully re-freeze until 800 years ago. Melting: A chunk of ice is shown drifting after it separated from the Ward Hunt Ice Shelf off the north coast of Ellesmere Island in Canada's far north in 2008 . It began to shrink again almost 100 years ago and is getting smaller every year. Dermot Antoniadesa said: 'At this point, it doesn’t appear that the shelf ice around Ellesmere Island is any smaller now than it was during the previous period of warming, but because it’s still shrinking, it’s possible it could become, an 'unprecedented' event.' The team published the results of their survey in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Ice shelves in the Arctic lost more than 90 per cent of their total surface area during the 20th century and are continuing to disintegrate rapidly.","Researchers think one Canadian ice shelf broke up 1,400 years ago and then re-froze ."
"Developers have unveiled plans for a new £2billion Paramount theme park in Britain to rival Disneyland Paris. The proposed development would create up to 27,000 jobs and transform an 872-acre brownfield site in the Swanscombe Peninsula in Kent. The 'world-class' venue will feature Europe’s largest indoor . water park, theatres, live music venues, attractions, cinemas, . restaurants, event space and hotels and, if given the green light, will be . twice the size of Olympic Park in East London. Attraction: Developers have unveiled plans to build one of the biggest theme parks in the world in Britain. The £2bn, 872-acre entertainment complex will create 27,000 jobs . Potential: The proposed site for the theme park is currently an overgrown wasteland . Brownfield: Is this the next hot European leisure destination? The ambitious resort will be located in the Swanscombe Peninsula in Kent, currently a brownfield site . That's entertainment: Swanscombe Penninsula as it appears on Google Earth . The site is on the doorstep of Ebbsfleet International railway station, which is 17 minutes from London and two hours from Paris. Tony Sefton, project leader for the development company London Resort Company Holdings (LRCH), said the plans were Britain’s biggest post-Olympic project and will take six years to build. Hollywood-on-Thames: Movie giant Paramount is involved in the plans. It owns the licence to a number of blockbuster films . 'Our vision is to create a world-class entertainment destination, the first of its kind in the UK,' he said. 'We are at the start of a long journey, but have been encouraged by the support and buy-in we have had to date. 'We are particularly pleased with the . appetite we are seeing from investors, who consider this a compelling . investment proposition. 'Over the next 12-18 months we will . be progressing the planning application, while embarking on a . wide-reaching programme of community consultation, while securing . further commercial agreements with third parties. 'Our . timetable for delivery, including the planning application process and . construction timetable, is geared towards completion and opening in . 2018.' LRCH has signed an . agreement with Paramount Licensing Inc, the licensing division of . Paramount Pictures, to give exclusive UK licensing for a Paramount . entertainment resort at the heart of the site. LRCH is also in negotiations with a range of major British brands to sign licensing agreements. Dartford and Gravesham Borough Councils have both offered support for the project. In a joint statement, Jeremy Kite, leader of Dartford Borough Council, and John Burden, leader of Gravesham Borough Council, said: 'This development represents a tremendous economic growth opportunity for the region.' There is no indication yet as to which of Paramount's films . might form the basis for any of the theme park's attractions. However, with such a huge library of films - the company is celebrating its centenary - it has produced, . co-produced or has distribution rights for, it could call on any number of hit . films to bring visitors flocking. The Indiana Jones series and Transformers, both distributed . by Paramount, would be provide ideal themes for rides too. In particular the mine chase from Temple of Doom could offer . an experience similar to Disneyland’s Thunder Mountain runaway train. To appeal to younger visitors, the park's creators could . well look to 2010 hit How to Train Your Dragon for inspiration, and a Top Gun . style flight simulator can't be out of the question. The production company has any number of horror movies it . can incorporate into a ride with a fear factor, such as the Friday the 13th . series. There were previously six Paramount theme parks in the United States . but these were all sold-off and re-branded during a company re-shuffle . in 2006. Today, they are operated without the Paramount backing but in their . heyday, rides on offer included Tomb Raider: The Ride and The Italian . Job: Stunt Tracks. Another Paramount theme is set to open in Murcia, Spain, in 2015 and company chiefs predict it will draw in three million visitors to the area every year. One of the main attractions in the pipeline is Titanic 4D, which will use state-of-the-art special effects to give guests a taste of the iconic vessel. Meanwhile a 4D Mission: Impossible ride will take visitors . through action scenes in a military-style vehicle. Social media was abuzz with when the news was announced. Teenager Abbie Brett tweeted: 'A theme park up the road... please can this happen', while student Matthew Partridge said: 'If it happens it will be brilliant for Kent '. Tweeter Jonny, a 23-year-old living in Newcastle, said: ''Used to live right beside here. Do it!'

"He was the forgotten hero of 1966. One of England’s greatest players, Jimmy Greaves missed out on a World Cup winner’s medal because injury stopped him from being on the pitch in the final matches. A long campaign by fans led to him finally being honoured in 2009. But those who fought to see him recognised are likely to be less than impressed by the fact he is now cashing in. Greaves has put the medal up for auction next week at Sotheby’s. The former footballer, now a 74-year-old great-grandfather, is expecting to bank up to £50,000 for the 18 carat gold award. Jimmy Greaves  with his medal and  then Prime Minister Gordon Brown in 2009 . Greaves' medal is expected to go for between  £30,000 and £50,000 at auction  when it goes under the hammer . Greaves won 57 caps for England and then worked on TV and as an after dinner speaker following retirement . Jimmy Greaves (front right) stands with chairman of the FA Geoff Thompson (front left) in front of the other recipients of medals presented by Prime Minister Gordon Brown, after a Downing Street reception for unused members of the 1966 World Cup squad in 2009 . Greaves had previously said it was ‘terrific’ to have finally received the medal, adding: ‘It was devastating for me that I didn’t play in the final. I always believed that we would win the World Cup and I’d be part of it, but I wasn’t.’ In May, the player-turned-TV pundit, who has battled alcoholism, sold the country house he shared with wife Irene. On Friday it also emerged that Mrs Greaves, who turns 75 on Sunday, has a county court judgment against her for an outstanding £185. The judgment, from August, gives her address as the £100,000 home where the pair’s daughter Lynn lives in Sudbury, Suffolk, suggesting they have now moved in with the 56-year-old. The couple have four children – Lynn, Mitzi, Andy and Danny. Greaves made his England debut in 1959 and is seen training with Johnny Haynes, Bobby Charlton and John Byrne in 1962 .

Greaves goes in goal during England training and makes a save as goalkeeper Gordon Banks watches on . Greaves scores one of his 44 goals for England in a game against the Rest of the World . Greaves scored 44 goals in a 57-match England career and was the most prolific striker of his generation, playing a crucial role in the earlier stages of the 1966 World Cup. But he was injured in the third game and replaced by Geoff Hurst, who kept his place for the final even though Greaves had recovered. Hurst – now Sir Geoff – famously went on to score a hat-trick in the 4-2 victory against West Germany at Wembley.

Until the 1978 tournament, only those who played in the final game won a medal. Greaves was badly affected by the snub – and by the death of his four-month-old son, Jimmy Jnr, in 1961 from pneumonia – and later became an alcoholic. However, he eventually stopped drinking and reinvented himself as a sports pundit, newspaper columnist and after-dinner speaker. Astonished at the injustice Greaves and other England squad players faced, fans campaigned for the ‘forgotten heroes’ of 1966 to be given medals retrospectively. Greaves and World Cup winning left back George Cohen have a chat on their return to London after a game . Greaves and Moore relax at the airport ahead of flying to a game . Greaves  has a drink with  Alfredo Di Stefano of Real Madrid at a party  at the Cafe Royale . The campaign eventually paid off, and in June 2009, Greaves and the others were presented with medals at Downing Street by then Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who said: ‘Justice has finally been done.’ Greaves smiled broadly as posed with his medal, saying: ‘What do I think? Yes, terrific, unexpected. Obviously, it is something FIFA or the good old FA feel has been, while not a wrong, something that needs to be put right. We are all part of the history of the World Cup.’ 1: NOBBY STILES, 72 Wept when he announced in 2010 that he was selling his medal for £188,200 to 'leave something' for his family . 2: ROGER HUNT, 76 Worked at a successful haulage firm after his football career and still has his medal . 3: GORDON BANKS, 76 Lost money in failed hospitality business and sold his medal in 2001 for £124,750 . 4: JACK CHARLTON, 79 Became a high-profile football manager and has said he will never sell his medal . 5: GEORGE COHEN, 75 Beset by illness and financial troubles, he sold his medal in 1998 for £80,000 . 6: RAY WILSON, 79 Became an undertaker after retiring from football and sold his medal for £80,000 in 2002 . 7: MARTIN PETERS, 70 Sold his medal for an unknown sum after reportedly being made redundant from his insurance company in 2001 . 8: SIR GEOFF HURST, 72 Sold for £150,000 in 2001 because he ‘could not split a medal three ways’ to pass to his daughters . 9: BOBBY MOORE After he died from cancer in 1993, Moore’s first wife, Tina, sold his medal for £150,000 . 10: ALAN BALL Sold his medal for £164,800 in 2005 – two years before his death – to provide for his grandchildren . 11: SIR BOBBY CHARLTON, 77 Now a director at Manchester United, he has not sold his medal, which is on display at Old Trafford . Friends said Greaves had not pushed to be given the award and has spent much of his life trying to play down the significance of missing out on the final. They said he ‘doesn’t give a monkey’s’ about memorabilia and medals and, having retired from punditry, ‘could probably do with the money’. Greaves played at a time when financial rewards for footballers were nothing like they are today. The World Cup winning team received a combined bonus from the FA of just £22,000. Greaves teamed up with Ian St John on TV for the Saint and Greavsie show between 1985 and 1992 . Greaves on the set of Open to Questions with golfer Bernard Gallacher, Ian St John, Tottenham chairman Alan Sugar and former Daily Mail journalist Ian Wooldridge .

Former neighbours in Suffolk said he had sold his detached country house in May after living there for just two years. Records show the house was bought in 2012 for £499,995 and then sold again this May for £499,950. The medal – which comes in the original wooden case and with ‘a signed letter of authenticity from Jimmy Greaves’ – is being auctioned as part of a sale of sporting memorabilia at Sotheby’s in London on Monday and Tuesday.","Jimmy Greaves did not play in the 1966 World Cup final due to injury .

"Scientists believe it may be possible to clone a woolly mammoth within five years after finding well-preserved bone marrow in a thigh bone recovered from permafrost soil in Siberia. Teams from Russia's Sakha Republic's mammoth museum and Japan's Kinki University will launch fully-fledged joint research next year aiming to recreate the giant mammal, Japan's Kyodo News reported from Yakutsk, Russia. By replacing the nuclei of egg cells from an elephant with those taken from the mammoth's marrow cells, embryos with mammoth DNA can be produced, Kyodo said, citing the researchers. Clone hope: The discovery of marrow inside the thigh bone of a woolly mammoth in Siberia has led scientists to believe they can bring the species back to life . Exciting: Mammoth bones like this one have been dug up many times before, but finding one with undamaged genes has proven a challenge (file picture) The scientists will then plant the embryos into elephant wombs for delivery as the two species are close relatives, the report said. Securing nuclei with an undamaged gene is essential for the nucleus transplantation technique, it said. For scientists involved in the research since the late 1990s, finding nuclei with undamaged mammoth genes has been a challenge. Fertile land: The thigh bone was discovered in the permafrost soil of Siberia as were these tusks which came from an entire 23,000-year-old mammoth dug up in 1999 . Mammoths became extinct about 10,000 years ago. But the discovery in August in Siberia has increased the chances of a successful cloning. Global warming has thawed ground in eastern Russia that is usually almost permanently frozen, leading to the discoveries of a number of frozen mammoths, the report said.","Thigh bone discovered in permafrost soil of Siberia .

"Some swear by hair of the dog, others by a strong black coffee. But the best way to cure a hangover is to tuck into a fried breakfast, a leading researcher has claimed. Richard Stephens, professor of psychology at Keele University, says the carbohydrates in a full English will help restore depleted sugar levels. Tuck in: The carbohydrates in a full English will help restore depleted sugar levels after a heavy night of drinking . Speaking ahead of the annual meeting of the international Alcohol Hangover Research Group, he said the best hangover cures are those that provide glucose. He told The Atlantic: 'One of the mechanisms of the hangover is to do with glucose metabolism and . not having enough blood sugar. 'In Britain, one of the most prevalent . hangover cures is a big fried breakfast - fried eggs, sausages, baked . beans, and all the rest - that’s well-renowned as a hangover cure in . Britain, and it probably does work because there are lot of . carbohydrates in that meal. And that will restore depleted sugar levels.' He admits on occasions when he has overindulged, a fried breakfast 'works wonders'. Professor Stephens, himself a member of the Hangover Research Group, added that  anti-inflammatory drugs . (such as ibuprofen) can also help, as can the migraine drug Tolfenamic acid and the herb borage. And hair of the dog? Speaking to Atlantic journalist Olga Khazan, he explained that once the ethanol in alcohol has been broken down by the body, it tackles other alcohols such as methanol, which can cause feelings of sickness. Cure: Anti-inflammatory drugs can also ease a hangover, as can the migraine drug Tolfenamic acid, says Professor Stephens . However if you drink more, the methanol won't be broken down - the body simply goes back to processing the ethanol. Hence why continuing to drink can stem the pain of a hangover. A study last year revealed why we crave a fry-up when we're hungover. Researchers at Cornell University found we are hardwired to want fat - and alcohol kills our willpower. 'All mammals gravitate to eating the most energy-dense foods,' explained David Levitsky, professor of human ecology and nutritional sciences. 'And fat is the most energy-dense food available.' Sober, you may not give in to those cravings, but after a night of boozy indulgence, you lose such learned inhibitions as disciplined eating, Levitsky added. And the other good news? Hangovers decline with age, he says.","Hangover expert Professor Richard Stephens says fry up 'works wonders'

"A third of Britons have admitted they can't delete people they dislike on Facebook - because they're too nosey or worried about the consequences of doing so. A survey has found the average number of friends on a person's Facebook is 287, yet just 10 per cent of people on these lists are friends the person likes and would want to spend time with socially.

"Princess Charlene and Prince Albert II of Monaco are expecting twins. The royal family will grow by two when the Princess, 36, gives birth at the end of this year, leading many to speculate which baby will inherit the principality. The couple first announced in May that they were expecting. A crown fit for two? Princess Charlene and Prince Albert II of Monaco are expecting twins - which has led many to speculate which baby will inherit the throne . Bump watch: In June the Prince said they are 'taking every cautious step to make sure everything goes well' with the pregnancy. Pictured: Charlene holding her bump on September 25 . According to the Constitution of the Principality, the first born baby is the closest in line to the throne, with priority given to males. What remains unclear is what will happen if the first born is a girl. In 2002, when Albert was still single, his father Prince Rainier quietly changed Monaco's constitutional laws to allow his daughters, Caroline and Stephanie, and their children to inherit the throne should Albert fail to marry and produce an heir. Charlene, a former Olympic swimmer from South Africa, married the Monegasque royal in July 2011. In June, Prince Albert told The Associated Press that he and his wife were 'overjoyed', 'thrilled' and 'very excited' about the impending arrival of their child - or children, as it is now known. Wedding bells: Charlene, 36, a former Olympic swimmer from South Africa, married the Monegasque royal in July 2011 . He said they are 'taking every cautious step to make sure everything goes well'. Albert, now 56, was a longtime bachelor who has acknowledged fathering two children out of wedlock - daughter Jazmin Grace Grimaldi, born in 1992 to American Tamara Rotolo, and Alexandre Coste, born in 2003 to Togo native Nicole Coste. While neither is in line to the throne, they are entitled to a portion of their father's fortune, which is said to be about $1billion. Rumors began swirling that twins were a possibility when fans noticed that the official birth announcement did not specify a number of children. Succession: In 2002, Prince Rainier changed Monaco's constitutional laws to allow his daughters Caroline (left) and Stephanie (right) and their children to inherit the throne should Albert fail to marry and produce an heir .

And a few days later, on May 30, South African journalist Derek Watts tweeted: 'My old bulawayo schoolmate mike wittstock has phoned to say his daughter is pregnant with twins. Congrats princess charlene and albert!' Mr Watts subsequently deleted the tweet, leading many to believe that he had unintentionally let the cat out of the bag too soon. Illegitimate: Prince Albert has two children out of wedlock - one of whom is daughter Jazmin Grace Grimaldi, 22, (pictured in September at left) who was born in California to a former waitress and brief fling. His son Alexandre Coste also has no claim to the throne . Prince Rainier III, whose wife was Grace Kelly, ruled the Principality of Monaco for 56 years before passing away in 2005. Under inheritance laws, neither of Prince Albert's two illegitimate children have any claim to royal titles and are not considered his official heirs. His daughter Jazmin was born in California to a former waitress with whom Prince Albert had a brief fling. Now 22, she recently graduated from Fordham University in New York. Royal family: Prince Rainier III, whose wife was Grace Kelly (pictured on their wedding day), ruled the Principality of Monaco for 56 years before passing away in 2005 . His son Alexandre, now ten, lives with his mother, a former Air France hostess from Togo, on the French Riviera. Prince Albert reportedly demanded DNA tests for both children before accepting paternity. Another recent case of an aristocratic figure having twin heirs was in 2009, when David Cholmondeley, 54, the seventh Marquess of Cholmondeley, welcomed twin boys with his wife Rose Hanbury, 29, a former fashion model. Born by C-section three months premature, the boys were named Alexander Hugh George and Oliver Timothy George. Older by a few minutes, Alexander is the heir-apparent to the Marquessate and bears the courtesy title Earl of Rocksavage because doctors pulled him out first. Oliver is known as Lord Cholmondeley and the brothers will have different last names. Alexander, who goes by Xan, stands to inherit the historic castle Houghton Hall as well as Cholmondeley Castle, which is surrounded by 7,500 acres. Oliver, being second son, missed out. As of 2008, David Cholmondeley had an estimated net worth of £60million, or $96.5million. Alexandre's mother told the Mail On Sunday in April that while he began as a loving and supportive father - albeit from afar - Albert's interest in his son has waned since he began a relationship with his now-wife. 'The truth is that, I'm sorry to say, Albert hasn’t seen Alexandre since a brief visit last September,' she claimed. 'It has become impossible since he married that girl.' In 2005, Prince Albert said in an interview with Larry King that while Alexandre will never inherit the throne, 'he will be very well taken care of' - presumably financially. While it's rare for a noble figure to have twin heirs, it has happened before - most recently in 2009, when David Cholmondeley, the seventh Marquess of Cholmondeley, welcomed twin boys with his wife Rose Hanbury, a former fashion model 23 years his junior. Born by C-section three months premature, the boys were named Alexander Hugh George and Oliver Timothy George. Older by a few minutes, Alexander is the heir-apparent to the Marquessate and bears the courtesy title Earl of Rocksavage. Oliver is known as Lord Cholmondeley. As of 2008, David Cholmondeley had an estimated net worth of £60million, or $96.5million.","Princess Charlene, 36, a former Olympic swimmer from South Africa, married the longtime bachelor in July 2011 .

"A British Muslim leader has called for action to tackle a jihadi sub-culture after an Islamic State video showed a suspected Briton beheading U.S. journalist James Foley, held hostage in Syria. Iqbal Sacranie, an adviser to the Muslim Council of Britain, said Britons from across the country's communities had to stop young men being seduced by radical ideologies. 'This sub culture of this ""jihadi-cool"" - as they call it in the media - within the margins of society ... that is the real challenge,' he told BBC Radio. 'This is a problem that affects all of us and it will only be dealt with more effectively if all of us are working together on this.' Scroll down for video . Iqbal Sacranie, Muslim Council of Britain advisor, said Brits had to stop young men being seduced by radical ideologies . Sacranie said the Muslim community was pushing the message that 'this is totally alien to Islam' and families were reporting to the authorities when they discovered their sons had headed to the Middle East to fight. He also told London's Evening Standard newspaper that anyone who recognised the man in the video had a duty to contact police. In Washington, U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said the threat from Islamic State was 'beyond anything we've seen' and the U.S. Justice Department opened a criminal investigation into the death of Foley on the video, which featured a masked man speaking English with a British accent. As Western officials tried to identify the man, the Muslim Council of Britain denounced Foley's 'abhorrent murder' and one of its advisers urged anyone who knows the killer's identity to contact the police. Horror at the video spanned from the West to Baghdad, where Iraqis asked why the United States and its allies had not cracked down on Islamic State fighters long before they captured large areas of Syria and Iraq. Foley, 40, was beheaded by an Islamic State militant in the video that surfaced on the Internet on Tuesday, and officials in Washington revealed that U.S. special forces had tried unsuccessfully to rescue him along with other American hostages earlier this summer. Sacranie said anyone who recognised the man in the video had a duty to contact police . A firefight between the U.S. forces and Islamic State militants during the rescue attempt appeared to be the first direct ground engagement between the two sides. The video caused particular shock in Britain, which is home to about 2.7 million Muslims, although the hundreds of British men fighting alongside the militants in Iraq and Syria have created concern for some time. The Guardian newspaper said a former hostage had identified the masked man as the leader of three Britons who guarded foreign hostages in the city of Raqqa - Islamic State's stronghold in eastern Syria. The BBC also reported that hostages had nicknamed their three captors John, Paul and Ringo, after members of the Beatles pop group. Ghaffar Hussain, managing director of the counter-extremism Quilliam Foundation, said it was almost inevitable that men who had fought in Syria would return to plan attacks in Europe. 'It is disturbing that people born and raised in Britain and who have gone to the same schools as us could have been essentially indoctrinated to the extent where they can justify raping women and chopping heads off,' he said. Four British Islamists - two of whom had been to al Qaeda training camps in Pakistan - killed 52 people in suicide bomb attacks on London in July 2005, and Britons have previously appeared in graphic Islamist videos. Until recently, Islamic State concentrated on establishing its self-proclaimed caliphate in areas of Syria and Iraq it had seized rather than on attacking the West, like al Qaeda - the group from which it split. But U.S. President Barack Obama's decision to order air strikes on its fighters in Iraq appears to have changed this. The beheading video also showed images of another U.S. journalist, Steven Sotloff, whose fate the group said depends on how the United States acts in Iraq. 'The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision,' the masked man says. In a Washington briefing on Thursday, Hagel said Islamic State was as sophisticated as any group the United States had seen and posed an imminent threat 'to every interest we have, whether it's in Iraq or anywhere else.' 'They are beyond just a terrorist group. They marry ideology, a sophistication of ... military prowess,' Hagel said. 'They are tremendously well-funded. This is beyond anything we've seen.' General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, suggested Islamic State would be a danger until it could no longer count on safe havens in Syria. 'This is an organization that has an apocalyptic, end-of- days strategic vision and which will eventually have to be defeated,' Dempsey said. 'To your question, can they be defeated without addressing that part of their organization which resides in Syria? The answer is no. That will have to be addressed on both sides of what is essentially at this point a non-existent border.' In Baghdad, Iraqis expressed their horror at the video of Foley's killing and questioned Western strategy on Islamic State, which advanced out of Syria in June to capture several major Iraqi cities, including Mosul, before the United States intervened militarily. 'The killing is the crime of all crimes, whoever the victim is,' said Kareem Jamal, 55, an Arabic language teacher at a secondary school. 'I wish the world superpowers had fought these criminal groups in their incubators. The U.S. should have hit Islamic State when they first appeared in Syria. Why didn't they hit them when they first entered Mosul and other cities?' Ali Mohammed Saeed, a 35-year-old doctor, called for deeper Western involvement, almost three years after U.S. troops pulled out of Iraq. 'Air strikes are not enough, those criminals need ground troops to kill them and kick them out.' British Prime Minister David Cameron has ruled out sending troops to step up Britain's military involvement in Iraq, which has so far been focused on delivering supplies to Kurdish forces fighting Islamic State and using jets to conduct surveillance.","Iqbal Sacranie said Brits have to stop young men being radicalised .

"Flores Gamez was crowned 2012 Woman of Sinaloa in February . Maria Susana Flores Gamez, the 20-year-old Mexican beauty queen killed in a shootout between suspected drug traffickers and soldiers, likely fired a gun during the clash in the Pacific coast state Sinaloa, a federal prosecutor said. Authorities had previously said that Flores Gamez was likely used as a human shield and that an automatic rifle had been found near her body on Saturday, November 24. Federal prosecutor Enrique Fedegrino said Tuesday that tests indicate there was gunpowder residue on her hands. He said authorities are still investigating if she shot at soldiers. Dangerous beauty? Maria Susana Flores Gamez, the Mexican beauty queen killed in a shootout between suspected drug traffickers and soldiers, likely fired a gun during the clash in the Pacific coast state Sinaloa, a federal prosecutor said . Flores Gamez, crowned 2012 Woman of Sinaloa in February, came out of the car first with a gun in her hands with the other gunmen hiding behind her, according to the attorney general's office. The military report of the shootout said she went down in a hail of gunfire and was found dead near the assault rifle along with two other bodies. Flores Gamez was crowned 2012 Woman of Sinaloa in February. The slender 5-foot-7-inch brunette had competed with seven other contestants for the more prestigious state beauty contest, Miss Sinaloa, but didn't win. Miss Sinaloa state winners compete for the Miss Mexico title, whose holder represents the country in the international Miss Universe pageant. 'Innocent': Miss Flores' family says she was . simply a bystander on the way to work when she was caught in the . crossfire and killed. They claim she was not involved with the cartel . Violent region: The gunbattle took place in a village in the drug-plagued western Mexican state of Sinaloa . Mexico's Ximena Navarrete was crowned Miss Universe in 2010. Local media outlets have continually to misidentified Flores Gamez as Miss Sinaloa. The organizers of the Miss Sinaloa pageant issued a statement on the pageant's Facebook page, seeking to make clear Flores Gamez was not their queen. The misidentification 'damages the image and tranquility of our queens, their families and friends', the statement said. Neither the state nor national pageants responded to requests for comment on Flores Gamez's death. Competitive model: The slender, 5-foot-7-inch brunette had competed with seven other contestants for the state beauty contest, Miss Sinaloa, but didn't win . It was at least the fourth documented case of a beauty queen or pageant contestant becoming involved with Mexican drug traffickers, the theme of the critically acclaimed 2011 movie Miss Bala, or Miss Bullet, Mexico's official submission to the Best Foreign Language Film category of Academy Awards. The film tells the story of a young woman competing for Miss Baja California who becomes an unwilling participant in a drug-running ring, finally getting arrested for deeds she was forced into performing. In real life, top Sinaloa cartel drug lord Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman married local beauty queen Emma Coronel, who later crossed into the United States to give birth to twin girls in 2011. In 2008, former Miss Sinaloa Laura Zuniga was stripped of her crown in the Hispanoamerican Queen pageant after she was detained that year on suspicion of drug and weapons violations. She was later released without charges. Prior drug trafficking suspect: Sinaloa Laura Zuniga during the official presentation of candidates for the beauty pageant 'Nuestra Belleza Mexico 2008' in Mexico City . In 2011, a Colombian former model and pageant contestant was detained along with Jose Jorge Balderas, an accused drug trafficker and suspect in the 2010 bar shooting of Salvador Cabanas, a former star for Paraguay's national football team and Mexico's Club America. She was also later released. 'A lot of young women are attracted by the false riches of the drug gangs. They offer the fantasy of a life of riches without much work,' said Judith del Rincon, a women's rights activist and former Sinaloa legislator. 'A lot of beauty queens wind up as girlfriends of some narco.' Del Rincon added that the involvement of drug lords with beauty queens dates back at least to the heyday of the Tijuana-based Arellano Felix drug gang in the 1990s. Tribute: For Belyn Parra, the pageant was a way to honor her idol and older cousin, Maria Susana Flores, Sinaloa Woman 2012, who died two months earlier in a shootout with Mexican soldiers while clutching an AK-47 . Sinaloa state prosecutor Marco Antonio Higuera said Flores Gamez was traveling in one of several vehicles that engaged soldiers in an hours-long chase and gun battle. He said two other members of the drug gang were detained. The shootout began when the gunmen opened fire on a Mexican army patrol. Soldiers gave chase and cornered the gang at a safe house in the town of Mocorito. Some men escaped, and the gun battle continued along a nearby roadway, where the gang's vehicles were eventually stopped. Six vehicles, drugs and weapons were seized following the confrontation. Higuera said Flores Gamez's body has been turned over to relatives for burial.","Maria Susana Flores Gamez, 20, likely fired a gun during the clash in Sinaloa, Mexico, on November 24, a federal prosecutor says .

"The number of confrimed Ebola cases has passed the 10,000 mark according to the World Health Organisation claiming the lives of almost 5,000 people. The United Nations health agency warned however that this landmark figure may be inaccurate due to significant under reporting of sickness certain parts of west Africa. The WHO fears that many people in the poorest parts of Africa are refusing to come forward for treatment because they are scared. Scroll down for video . The World Health Organisation today confirmed that more than 10,000 people have been infected with Ebola . The disease has so far claimed the lives of almost 5,000 people although the figure could be far higher . However, this current outbreak is the largest ever seen. It has hit Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Spain and America. As well as a reluctance in coming forward, the WHO complained that there are not enough laboratory capacity to handle the large volume of potentially infected blood samples. This backlog could also lead to an under reporting of the outbreak. According to the WHO the number of confirmed, probable and suspected cases of the disease is now 10,141 with 4,922 fatalities. The number of suspected cases has increased by 200 over the past four days. On Thursday, authorities confirmed that the disease had spread to Mali, the sixth west African country affected, and on the same day a new case was confirmed in New York, in a doctor recently returned from Guinea. Mali had long been considered highly vulnerable to the disease, since it shares a border with Guinea. The disease arrived there in a two-year-old, who travelled from Guinea with her grandmother by bus and died yesterday. Experts feared that Mali was vulnerable to the Ebola as it shares a border with Guinea. Authorities have set up a screening station on the border, but it failed to identify a two-year-old girl who later died of the disease . The United Nations has airlifted more than one tonne of medical supplies into Mali to cope with any outbreak . The toddler, who was bleeding from her nose during the journey, might have had high-risk contact with many people, the WHO warned. So far, 43 people are being monitored in isolation for signs of the disease, and the WHO said authorities are continuing to look for more people at risk. The Malian president Ibrahim Boubacar Keita said he will not close the border to Guinea despite the Ebola threat. It has emerged that the girl travelled hundreds of kilometres through Mali - including a stop in the capital Bamako - on public transport, potentially exposing many people to the virus, before she died in the western town of Kayes on Friday. Keita said that the incident showed it was impossible to completely seal his country off from Ebola in neighbouring Guinea but said he remained calm as the girl's journey and potential contacts had already been traced. He told Frances RFI radio: 'Guinea is Mali's neighbour. We have a shared border that we did not close and we will not close.' Land-locked Mali relies on the ports of neighbouring Senegal, Guinea and Ivory Coast as gateways for much of its import needs. There is little accurate data but border closures by West African states trying to protect themselves from the epidemic have had a crippling effect on regional economies. These workers are busily constructing a new treatment centre for Ebola on the outskirts of Monrovia, Liberia . Keita said that the girl's grandmother had made a mistake by going to a funeral in Guinea, where more than 900 people have died of Ebola, and bringing her back. He said: 'We are paying dearly for this. But I think this will cause more fear than anything else. The case was quickly contained.' Local and international Ebola experts are rushing teams to Mali to help try to contain the outbreak in the sixth West African nation to record Ebola this year. Senegal and Nigeria have contained outbreaks and been declared free of the disease. Diplomats and health experts say the girl appears to have had Ebola-like symptoms and travelled for four days before she was eventually diagnosed with the disease on October 23. Ebola cases are contagious as soon as they show symptoms. The World Health Organisation said that 43 contacts had been identified and isolated. But a Malian health official, who asked not to be identified, said authorities estimated that at least 300 people had been in contact with the infected child. Keita added: 'We will do everything we can to avoid panic. I notice that Bamako is calm today.' To help fight Ebola, the UN humanitarian flight service airlifted about a tonne of medical supplies to Mali late yesterday. The seats of the plane were removed to make room for the cargo, which included hazard suits for health workers, surgical gloves, face shields and buckets, according to the World Food Programme, which runs the flights. Denise Brown, west Africa regional director with the UN food agency said: 'Speed is of the essence in this Ebola crisis. Agencies such as WFP and WHO are working every hour to confront together the virus as a matter of priority.' New York and New Jersey have implemented stringent quarantine restrictions for suspected new cases . In the United States, a women who arrived on a flight to New Jersey from west Africa showing symptoms of the disease has tested negative to Ebola. New Jersey Department of Health said the woman remains under observation and in isolation at University Hospital in Newark. She is a health care worker who arrived yesterday from west Africa, where she had contact with Ebola patients. She initially showed no symptoms of the virus but later developed a fever. The woman, who arrived at Newark Liberty International Airport, became the first traveller to be quarantined under an Ebola watch in New York and New Jersey. President Obama has tried to promote calm by hugging Texas nurse Nina Pham who survived the disease . The governors of those states had announced a mandatory 21-day quarantine of medical workers and other airline passengers who have had contact with Ebola victims. The move came after a doctor who returned to New York City a week ago from treating Ebola patients in Guinea fell ill with the virus. Many New Yorkers were dismayed to learn that in the days after he came home, Craig Spencer travelled on the subway system, took a taxi, went bowling, visited a coffee shop and ate at a restaurant in the city of eight million. New Jersey governor Chris Christie and New York's Andrew Cuomo said the case led them to conclude that the two states needed precautions more rigorous than those of the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC recommends monitoring of exposed people for 21 days but does not require quarantine. Mr Cuomo said: 'It's too serious a situation to leave it to the honour system of compliance.'","World Health Organisation fears the actual outbreak figure could be higher .

"An Irish golfer says giving up Coca-Cola has ruined his athletic performance. Peter Lawrie has fallen down the golf league tables in recent years, and has blamed his slump in form on the fact he gave up drinking litres of Coca-Cola a day. The Irishman was ranked No 105 in the world rankings in October 2010 but is now sitting at a lowly position of No 726. And Mr Lawrie claims this was because he went from drinking litres of fizzy drinks to just a few cans. Peter Lawrie says quitting an 'addiction' to Coca-Cola has affected his athletic performance. He claims he has seena slump in form ever since he stopped drinking litres of Coca-Cola a day. He is pictured in action during the third round of the Maybank Malaysian Open last week . A 330ml can of Coca-Cola contains 35g of sugar, the equivalent of almost nine teaspoons. It also contains 32mg of caffeine, a third of the amount in a mug of instant coffee . Mr Lawrie, 40, told Irish radio station Newstalk: 'I cut it out completely and went from such a high on sugar to a dramatic low. I never recovered. 'I lost all confidence in myself. I wouldn't say I went through a breakdown but I definitely got exceptionally emotional. 'It was very difficult to deal with all of the situations coming at me. 'Whether that had anything to do with my mental state in any shape or form, I have no idea. 'I drink two or three cans a day [now] but I was drinking litres of the stuff. 'Even in the hottest country, like Malaysia, I'd have a Coke on the golf course because I was addicted to it.' Coca-Cola contains 53g of sugar per 500m bottle. This means if that if Mr Lawrie was drinking two litres a day, he would be consuming 212g of sugar a day. Peter Lawrie said he was drinking several litres of Coca-Cola a day. ONE litre of Coca-Cola contains: . 106 g sugar: the equivalent of 26 and a half teaspoons . 420 calories: 17 per cent of an average man's daily recommended calorie intake and 21 per cent of a woman's. 106 mg caffeine, the equivalent to a mug of instant coffee. Chris Cashin, chair of Sports Dietitians UK, said Mr Lawrie would have been consuming high levels of sugar and caffeine if he was drinking litres of Coca-Cola a day. She told MailOnline: ‘Coke has caffeine in it which is performance enhancing. It’s a stimulant, it makes you more alert. 'It can enhances fatty acid tissue, so it aids recovery too.’ ‘If you have caffeine withdrawals that can affect you mood, concentration and athletic performance.’ ‘Cutting all that sugar out could certainly have caused a dip in Mr Lawrie's mood.' She added: ‘Normal people who drink fizzy drinks would be overweight. He’s burning off the calories because he’s very active. ‘In some people drinking that much sugar, there will be concerns about diabetes and insulin resistance.’ Another problem with consuming large volumes of fizzy drinks is they cause tooth decay, she said. She added: ‘Anecdotally, clients who drink a lot of Coke complain of heartburn. 'It’s very acidic. I buy it to clean my jewellery. If it’s able to strip dirt off gold, imagine what it’s doing to your insides.’ That’s the equivalent of 53 teaspoons of sugar. It’s also more than double the recommended amount of sugar (50g) that an adult should eat in a day, according to current guidelines from the World Health Organisation. Sugar should account for no more than 10 per cent of the calories in the diet, or around 12.5 teaspoons. However there are plans in the pipeline to halve this recommended daily amount to just 25g, or around six teaspoons. Chris Cashin, chair of Sports Dietitians UK who has worked with several professional golfers – and other athletes – agreed that Mr Lawrie would have been consuming high levels of sugar and caffeine if he was drinking litres of Coca-Cola a day. Stopping suddenly could have plausibly caused a dip in his mood and performance if he wasn’t replacing the carbohydrates he had been previously been drinking, she said. She told MailOnline: ‘Cutting all that sugar out, could certainly have caused a dip in his mood. ‘He didn’t specify whether he was eating food as well, so it may have been he was getting all his carbohydrates from Coke. 'I would far rather athletes get their carbs - which play a role in mood regulation - in the form of potatoes and wholegrain pasta, for example. ‘Normal people who drink fizzy drinks would be overweight. He’s burning off the calories because he’s very active. ‘In some people drinking that much sugar, there will be concerns about diabetes and insulin resistance, too.' Drinking such large volumes of Coca-Cola would also have meant he was consuming high levels of caffeine - and stopping this suddenly could cause a a dip in mood and performance. One litre of Coca-Cola contains 106mg of caffeine, the equivalent to a mug of instant coffee. Experts recommend drinking no more than 400mg of caffeine a day. Ms Cashin said: ‘Coke has caffeine in it which is performance enhancing. It’s a stimulant, it makes you more alert. ‘However if you have caffeine withdrawal, that can affect you mood, concentration and athletic performance.’ Caffeine was on the World Anti-Doping Agency’s list of banned substances until 2004. Mr Lawrie says after quitting drinking two litres of Coca-Cola a day he lost confidence in himself.  He said: 'I wouldn't say I went through a breakdown but I definitely got exceptionally emotional. It was very difficult to deal with all of the situations coming at me' Ms Cashin added: ‘Ten years ago we were advising people not to drink it, as 350mg a day pushed you over the limit.' Another problem with consuming large volumes of fizzy drinks is they cause tooth decay, she said. ‘We are beginning to see athletes with tooth problems due to fizzy drinks and sports drinks. 'The diet versions also erode the enamel. I’m always conscious of talking to athletes about their teeth.’ The evidence on whether sugar or caffeine is addictive or not is unclear, she said, however some athletes develop a psychological dependence. She said: ‘It could be a psychological habit or addiction. Lots of athletes do very strange things and feel upset if they don’t do them. So it could be something like that. ‘I wouldn’t like to link Mr Lawrie’s performance with his Coke “addiction” because in my view it sends out a message to younger athletes who we’re trying to tell not to drink these drinks.’","Peter Lawrie says his slump in form was due to an addiction to fizzy drinks .

"Ferguson city leaders have pledged to raise money for vest and patrol-car cameras for their police officers in a bid to increase the transparency of their interactions with the community and win back trust. The promise comes amid violent protests over the fatal shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown by white police officer Darren Wilson in a quiet street in the St. Louis district on August 9. 'We plan to learn from this tragedy, as we further provide for the safety of our residents and businesses and progress our community through reconciliation and healing,' officials said in a public statement.

It added: 'We are exploring a range of actions intended for the community to feel more connected to and demonstrate the transparency of our city departments… including commitment to raise funds and secure dash and vest cams for our patrol cars.' Complaints about the police fell by 88 per cent in Rialto, California, after officers were equipped with vest cams. Protests on the streets of Ferguson, Missouri, were significantly calmer on Tuesday night, but the peaceful atmosphere disintegrated amid a series of clashes that led to 47 arrests, with police claiming they were pelted with bottles containing urine. Complaints about the police fell by 88 per cent in Rialto, California, after officers were equipped with vest cams . For most of the night demonstrations were calm with protesters holding signs and chanting, although the majority had taken the advice of leaders to wrap things up by nightfall. Then just before midnight, the protests took a turn for the worst after some people started throwing plastic bottles at police. Missouri State Highway Patrol Captain Ron Johnson told CNN that 'criminals' had thrown urine at officers. Local community activists quickly attempted to defuse the situation by linking arms and standing in between the authorities and the remaining protesters. Protests on the streets of Ferguson were significantly calmer on Tuesday night, but the peaceful atmosphere disintegrated amid a series of clashes that led to 47 arrests . Over the next hour or so arrests were made as police, who were out in force once again, attempted to gain control of the situation again. The crowds were smaller than on previous evenings as the protests continued over the killing of Michael Brown. 'Hands up! Don't shoot' was one again the mantra, although many demonstrators added a second chant: 'We protesters, we don't loot.' Although plastic bottles were thrown, there were no reports of the teargas and Molotov cocktail exchanges that had blighted recent nights. Malik Zulu Shabazz, the president of the Black Lawyers for Justice and former chairman of the New Black Panther Party, was out on the streets trying to instill calm into the protesters. His organization and others, made up mostly of black volunteers, have taken it upon themselves to help ease tensions in Ferguson, confident the protesters are more likely to listen to them than police. Benjamin Crump, an attorney for Brown's family, said the 18-year-old's funeral and memorial service would be on Monday. The time and location had not been finalized. Despite the turmoil in Ferguson, its mayor, James Knowles, declared that the area is not racially divided. He told MSNBC: 'There's not a racial divide in the city of Ferguson.

"This is the woman with whom Kansas City Chiefs linebacker Jovan Belcher reportedly spent his final few hours - before he went home, shot dead his girlfriend and then took his own life. Brittni Glass, pictured as she walked to work at an Armani Exchange in Kansas City, enjoyed drinks and dinner with the NFL star before witnesses reportedly saw him enter her apartment building. The images come as frantic 911 calls made by Belcher's mother were also released, revealing the chaotic scene as she begged his girlfriend to 'stay with me' after he shot her multiple times. Just hours before she made the call, Belcher was awoken by police officers at 2.50am as he slept outside an apartment block in his car.

VIDEO: Frantic 911 call made by Belcher's mother after he shot girlfriend dead . Murder: 25-year-old Jovan Belcher, killed his girlfriend and then himself over the weekend . Campus . police reports from Belcher's time studying at UMaine have revealed how he . was unable to control his temper when it came to girlfriends. As a freshman in 2006, he became upset over a girl and punched his arm through a window, cutting it, the Portland Press Herald reported. He was treated at the scene for a 'possible severed thumb and lacerations to the wrist'. 'I was told that Belcher was upset over a . girl and punched a window out,' a police report noted. 'There was a lot . of blood outside of the west entrance and in the lobby.' Belcher, who graduated with a degree in child development and family relations, was referred to Judicial Affairs for disorderly conduct and restitution for $200 in damages. In 2007, he had a noise complaint . brought against him as he argued with a girlfriend after she had failed . to get in touch with him by a certain time that night. 'He became worried and when she did . show . up he told her that he did not want to see her until the morning,' the . report said. 'She asked to stay with him but he said that it would be . better for her to leave.' Police added that there was no sign of a physical fight or alcohol being involved. Campus police also responded to a call from a college residence's bathroom a year earlier after Belcher became 'ill and slow to respond to questions', but it was not believe drugs or alcohol were involved. Baby Zoey is in her custody and Shepherd said the girl is doing 'fine'. After shooting his girlfriend dead, . he reportedly leaned over her body, said he was sorry and kissed her on . the head. He then apologised to his mother, kissed his daughter and . left. He then drove to Arrowhead Stadium, . where he came across Chiefs General Manager Scott Pioli and got out of . his car with his gun pointed at his own head. 'I did it,' he said, according to police. 'I killed her.' Piolo tried to persuade Belcher to . put down the gun but Belcher simply thanked him for everything he had . done for him, and asked him to take care of his daughter. As Chiefs Head Coach Romeo Crennel and linebackers coach Gary Gibbs arrived, Belcher reportedly said: 'Guys, I have to do this.' With the sounds of police sirens . getting closer, Belcher ignored the pleas of his bosses and walked away, . saying, 'I got to go, I can't be here.' He then knelt behind a car, made the . sign of the cross across his chest and fired a single shot into his . head, the Star reported. 'He cared about her,' Police Sgt. Richard Sharp said. 'I don't think he could live with himself.' Snapp said Belcher also used two separate, legally registered handguns in the shootings. The deaths came after the relationship . between Belcher and Perkins had become strained. The couple briefly . lived apart recently before getting back together by Thanksgiving, . friend Brianne York told The Associated Press. 'It wasn't a healthy thing that was . going on,' Perkins' cousin Angela Perkins, 32, of Round Rock, Texas, . said of the relationship.

Sports Illustrated reported, who commiserated about the Chief's record. 'I see y'all boys aint doing too well,' Paramoure said. 'Wats goen on wit u besides ball.' 'Our 'o' can't even put 7 in the . board for us, but everything good bro, baby momma crazy but I have a . little girl almost 3 month man and she's a blessing, she makes me smile . on the worst day,' Belcher responded.

"Kristina Chesterman, a 21-year-old nursing student from California, was killed by a suspected drunken driver last year before she ever got a chance to travel, learn how to fly a plane or ride a camel. But now Susan Vieria, 64, has made a commitment to fulfill all the wishes on the bucket list of the young woman whose heart is beating in her chest. Chesterman, from Livermore, was left brain dead after a car operated by 19-year-old Riley Hoover slammed into her bike just a block from her home near Chico State University campus last September. Unbreakable bond: Kristina Chesterman (left), a 21-year-old nursing student from California, was an organ donor, so when she was killed in a horrific DUI crash last year, her heart went to 64-year-old Susan Vieria (right) Scene: Her destroyed bike (pictured) was carried for another 200 feet by a suspected 19-year-old drunken driver . The beautiful college sophomore was studying to be a nurse because she wanted to save lives, and she was also a registered organ donor - a decision that ended up giving at least five people, Vieria among them, a second chance. Three days after Chesterman’s horrific accident, the 64-year-old South Bay resident, who had suffered congestive heart failure, got a call from Stanford University Hospital saying that a match has been found. ‘I never dreamed in my life, how they would remedy my heart,’ Vieira told the station KCRC. Later that same night, Vieria underwent a successful heart transplant. With her health on the mend, Vieria took to Facebook in order to find her donor's family and express her gratitude for Chesterman's selfless act. The 64-year-old woman and Chesterman's mother, Sandra, met face to face for the first time two weeks ago. Life saver: Kristina Chesterman (right) studied nursing at Chico State University and was committed to helping others any way she could . Second chances: A portion of Chesterman's liver went to a baby boy (left), and one of her kidney's was donated to family friend Sakariah Pappachan (right) ‘I felt an instant connection,’ Sandra Chesterman said. ‘I felt that I've known her for a long time. I felt comfortable right away. Even on the phone talking to her, I felt a connection.’ Although she is in her golden years, Vieria has vowed to Kristina's family that as long as she is physically capable, she will do all the things their daughter had aspired to do in her lifetime. According to the late student's mother, some of the items on Kristina’s extensive bucket list were learning how to pilot a plane, travel around the world and ride a camel. ‘Kristina's waiting there to advise me,’ Miss Vieria said while sitting next to her donor’s mother. According to San Jose Mercury News, the young woman also dreamed of running through a poppy field and flying in a hot-air balloon. Besides Vieria, Chesterman has given a new lease on life to four other people, including two babies, one of whom got a portion of her liver, and family friend Sakariah Pappachan, who received a kidney. Daughter's wish list: Kristina's mother, Sandra Chesterman (right) told Vieria (left) that the 21-year-old wanted to learn how to fly a plane, ride a camel, travel, run through a poppy field and fly in a hot-air balloon . Heart to heart: Mrs Chesterman said she felt instant connection with the elderly woman who now has her daughter's heart beating in her chest . Sandra Chesterman told the paper in February that ever since she was a little girl, Kristina was passionate about helping others. She often donated blood, and at age 18, she registered as an organ donor because it was ‘the right thing to do.’ The student’s family are currently working on building a health clinic in Nigeria that will bear Kristina’s name. Meanwhile, her friends also have been busy ticking items off her bucket list, including skydiving, which Bridget Kline did over the ocean off San Diego recently. Another fiend Chris Leslie took Chesterman’s photo with him when he flew first-class to Japan - something she always wanted to do. Living out her fantasies: Kristina's friends have been busy ticking items off her bucket list, like sky-diving and flying first class . Still dreaming big: Chesterman's family are now building a health clinic in Nigeria in her name . ‘You wonder why someone like that is taken so young, but I believe Kristina was one of those very rare people who was so complete as a person already. ... The rest of us are just a work in progress,’ Leslie told the paper. Riley Hoover, the driver who crashed into Chesterman’s bike September 22, 2013, and then fled from the scene, is currently awaiting trial. He could face up to 14 years in prison if convicted of hit-and-run, DUI and gross vehicular manslaughter.","Kristina Chesterman was less than a block from her home in Chico, California, when she was hit by SUV and carried 120 feet last September .

"Married to an Islamic State extremist in Syria complete with handguns and his' n' hers Kalashnikov rifles, Khadijah Dare's is no ordinary life. But it is a world away from her previous existence as the Lewisham teenager who wore jeans and platform heels and loved her mother's home cooking. And hours after the beheading of American journalist James Foley at the hands of a British jihadist, this 22-year-old gloated on social media at his execution and vowed that she would be the first British woman to kill a US soldier. Scroll down for video . Hatred: Khadijah Dare, 22, was born a non-Muslim in south London but has urged others to follow her in jihad . Dare was gleeful that the 'UK must be shaking up' after the execution and from her home in the Syrian scrub she tweeted: 'Any links 4 da execution of da journalist plz. Allahu Akbar. UK must b shaking up haha. I wna b da 1st UK woman 2 kill a UK or US terorrist!' Dare's Twitter account is already notorious – not least because of the photograph of her then four-year-old son Isa, meaning 'Jesus', holding an AK-47 rifle. Her Twitter feed is littered with images of dead bodies and Islamic State propaganda, but juxtaposed with these are pictures which belie the normal young girl she once was. The irony of the images she has posted of 'beautiful' sunsets, baby seals and a kitten in a teacup alongside those of extremist horror are apparently lost on her. Khadijah Dare – one of her many post-conversion pseudonyms – grew up in Lewisham, south London, as a non-Muslim, and an acquaintance of hers told the Evening Standard that she was 'very endearing and sweet. Disturbing: A Twitter post showing Dare's four-year-old son grinning as he brandishes an AK-47 rifle . Arranged marriage: She became radicalised online before marrying her Swedish husband Abu Bakr . 'She was a bit of a tomboy but sometimes at weddings I'd see her wearing tight jeans and platforms. She also had braces and dimples and was very cute.' Tomboy Dare liked to watch football on TV as a child, and loved Chinese food and her mother's home cooking. When she was older she went to a local college to study media studies, film studies, psychology and sociology, and was a popular young girl. But it was at the age of 18, four years ago, that she converted to Islam and began worshipping at the Lewisham Islamic Centre – which has links to both the Woolwich killers of Lee Rigby and radical cleric Abu Hamza. She admitted in a Channel 4 report last year that when she began wearing the full face veil in Lewisham people on the street told her to 'go back to her country', to which she replied: 'I was born round the corner'. In the same footage she urges other Muslims to 'stop being so selfish...focusing on your families or studies' and implores them to join her in Syria and join the holy war. Horrific: James Foley was brutally murdered by ISIL. Dare disgustingly gloated on social media at his execution . Dare allegedly became radicalised online and moved to Syria in 2012, before marrying her Swedish Muslim jihadist husband Abu Bakr, arranged by his mother. Bakr is fighter with the Sunni jihadi militia known as Katiba al Muhajireen - the battalion of migrants – which joined forces with Islamic State and wants to create an Islamic caliphate. The Londoner has admitted that her parents are unaware of her new life, and as well as the pseudonym Khadijah Dare she goes by 'Umm Isa' meaning 'mother of Isa' and Muhajirah fi Sham, meaning 'Immigrant in Syria'. As her toddler sons Isa and Abdur Rahman stumbled about her gun-littered living room floor last year, Dare was unrepentant of her decision to move to Syria and of her departure from the girl-next-door who traded her promising British life for one of violence and hatred. Muslims attending Friday prayers at the London mosque where female jihadist Khadijah Dare used to worship today insisted it was not a breeding ground for terrorists. Today people at the Lewisham Islamic Centre spoke of their shock and horror at what she had said as they left the mosque in south east London. A woman, in her early twenties wearing a white headscarf who would not give her name, said: 'I know Khadijah. She attended the mosque a couple of years ago. 'She's a very nice girl, a good person, I had no idea she was fighting in Syria. I'm shocked to hear it, it seems so unlike her.' Another woman said it was impossible to know Khadijah's motivations, but wondered why the media was so interested. She said: 'My father's a soldier for the British army, yet no-one challenges him when he goes off to fight. Why should it be any different for us? 'Either the media wants us to condemn going out to Syria to fight or it sees us as supporting terrorists. But I'm sure she had good reasons for what she did.'","Khadijah Dare, 22, was born a non-Muslim in Lewisham, south London .

"The BBC played into the hands of terrorists when it carried an interview with an Islamic State fanatic, it was claimed last night. Newsnight broadcast the rants of the Briton who claimed to have joined IS fighters in murdering prisoners in Iraq. He defended attacks on British soldiers and was given airtime to declare his hatred for the UK and threaten a bombing campaign here. Scroll down for video . Armed: UK-born fanatic 'Awlaki', who claims to have joined IS fighters, told Newsnight that atrocities were allowed under Islam. He said he would only return to the UK to 'plant a bomb' Former security minister Dame Pauline Neville-Jones said the interview should not have been aired. ‘We can perfectly well be informed about their views and attitudes without giving them access to mainstream media on a corporation that has a reputation to preserve,’ she added. ‘It gives them a degree of access and a status and an importance they should not be accorded.’ Tory MP Michael Ellis said: ‘This interview was unnecessary and gratuitous and gave free air time and the oxygen of publicity to vile views.’ Nigel Evans, a fellow Conservative, said: ‘Newsnight has done a great disservice by giving these insane terrorists the oxygen of publicity. Apart from brutal murders, it’s what they seek most. ‘They are playing into the hands of these terrorists by giving them the opportunity to speak directly to a small group of vulnerable people who may be seduced by their fundamentalist and extreme messages.’ The interview was broadcast on Wednesday night following news of the beheading of American journalist John Foley, apparently by a British national. The report was introduced as an examination of the mindset that would lead a Briton to join Islamic State and kill in its name. Former security minister Pauline Neville-Jones said the interview should not have been aired . Reporter Secunder Kermani said he had been ‘in correspondence’ with the British IS recruit over several months. The fanatic, who said he was a 27-year-old British Pakistani, called himself Awlaki – after Anwar al-Awlaki, the dead Al Qaeda preacher. The BBC published pictures of him posing with his weapon. Awlaki laughed when asked if reports of Islamic State fighters beheading their enemies was true. ‘Yeah we kind of beheaded some guys as well,’ he said. ‘I believe there was about maybe four, three or four guys that we beheaded.’ Awlaki claimed to have travelled to Syria to fight the Assad regime but then joined IS because it was ‘the only group fighting for the return of the caliphate’. He said he had been shot and injured while fighting near Aleppo in northern Syria. At one point Kermani asked what his response would be to US air strikes and Awlaki was allowed to rant in what even the interviewer admitted sounded like ‘pure propaganda’. Awlaki said: ‘Bring your soldiers, your American soldiers, your British soldiers, bring them all to ISIS. We’ll send them back one by one in (sic) corpses. Also America doesn’t need to attack ISIS in Iraq for us to attack them back.’ He insisted atrocities committed against captured soldiers were ‘permissible’ under Islam ‘just as it is permissible for our brothers in the UK to execute British soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan’. This was an apparent reference to the horrific murder of Drummer Lee Rigby in Woolwich. He said: ‘I hate the UK. The only reason why I would intend to return back to the UK is if I want to go plant a bomb somewhere.’ After playing one Awlaki rant, Kermani commented that despite his ‘angry and violent tone’ the fanatic was, in their exchanges, often ‘softly spoken’. A BBC spokesman said: ‘We have given great consideration to our reporting of the murder of James Foley and made it clear that these views would be intolerable to the majority. ‘We utterly refute any suggestion that Newsnight offered a platform for extremist views. We have a responsibility to both report on the story and try to shed light on what is happening in Syria and Iraq,  particularly with British citizens fighting there. ‘An interview with a British IS fighter offered insights into this crime. The interview was given context by our reporters and the subsequent discussion where contributors discussed the ‘barbaric behaviour’ of the group.’","British Pakistani 'Awlaki' said atrocities were 'permissible' under Islam law .

"Ali Carter has said he will feel no pressure to win when he makes his return to snooker, believing he already is triumphant just to be back playing following an intensive course of chemotherapy for lung cancer. The 2008 and 2012 World Championship runner-up admits he is 'not quite out of the woods', but remains optimistic over his condition, so much so that he has entered the Players Tour Championship event in Bulgaria, which runs from October 3-5. It would be his first tournament since his diagnosis in May, but the 35-year-old, who had already beaten testicular cancer last year and suffers from Crohn's disease, is unfazed whether his comeback is a success. Fighting back: Ali Carter is heading back to the snooker table after receiving treatment for lung cancer . 'This has opened my eyes a little bit because winning is not the most important thing to me now,' he said in an interview with BBC Sport. 'I feel it has taken the pressure off my shoulders having faced what I have faced and beaten what I have beaten. I have really got nothing to be afraid of any more. 'Of course I want to win tournaments, but really what difference does it make? I was not thinking about tournaments I had won in hospital. 'I would have had it taken away from me to have my health back. Up for a fight: Carter is a two-time World Championship runner-up at the Crucible . 'While I can hang on to that feeling I think there are some big things to come for me in sport.' Carter revealed he has not yet had the all-clear but is positive he will do soon. 'I have had positive results,' he added. 'I am not quite out of the woods yet but I am nearly there, I have one last procedure on September 11 and then hopefully it will be job done. 'I am nearly out the other side.

"When Jakki Ballan started putting on weight as a teenager, her well-meaning GP suggested that she swap her favourite full-fat Coke for the lower-calorie diet version. She duly slimmed down, but soon developed an astonishing obsession with the fizzy drink which has seen her spend as much as £150,000 over the last three decades. At one stage the single mother of five would finish up to 50 cans a day – more than three per waking hour. Jakki Ballan says she is addicted to Diet Coke and drinks about 10 litres a day. This is the amount she drinks every week . She was consuming more than 28 pints of Diet Coke every day, the equivalent of double her own body weight a week. Miss . Ballan, who quit her job at a dry cleaners 16 years ago to go on maternity leave, found her habit was also financially draining – costing her . around £500 a month at her worst. And while she has tried to tackle her addiction she still gets through the equivalent of 30 cans a day. At one point, her 30-year dependence became so severe she was spending £500 a month on the drink . Yesterday . at her home in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, the 42-year-old pleaded for . help, saying: ‘This addiction is taking over my life. I won’t do the . school run unless I have at least two bottles in my bag. ‘I’ve only got one bottle in the house so I’m feeling quite panicky. I’m sweating, shaking and pacing up and down. ‘I’ve reached a point where this has got to stop.’ Ms Ballan is now seeking medical treatment, including hypnotherapy, to conquer overcome her addiction after suffering hallucinations as a result of consuming so much . Miss . Ballan said she suffers constant headaches and recently began . experiencing hallucinations which she blames on the drink. ‘I see . strange things like oranges flying across the room,’ she said. ‘I dread . to think what my insides look like.’ Miss . Ballan recently visited her GP, but he told her there was nothing he . could do. But Dr Sarah Schenker, a dietitian for the British Dietetic . Association, urged her to try cognitive behavioural therapy – as she . said the phosphoric acid contained in the drink would eventually damage . her bones. She added: . ‘This woman is suffering cravings that are influencing her life. Diet . Coke is part of her routine and the reward system in her brain may be . responding to it.’ She also suffers from constant headaches and has recently started to experience hallucinations, which she puts down to her dependence on Diet Coke . Ms Ballan says she panics if she doesn't have access to a constant supply of the fizzy drink . 'Drinking Diet Coke has become part of her routine and the reward system in her brain may be responding to it. 'Fizzy drinks contain phosphorous, which is not harmful in small doses. But if it's consumed in very large doses it can be bad for bone health. It's this lasting damage that is worrying. ""But my biggest concern is that if this woman is filling herself up on Diet Coke she will not be eating a balanced diet and giving her body the nutrients it needs. 'There are things she can do to break the habit. In this case, her perception is everything, so I would suggest Cognitive Behavioural Therapy. 'This is often used for people with eating disorders, and could help her change her behaviour and learn to cope without Diet Coke.' Ms Ballan has now vowed to seek help from a hypnotherapist to help change her behaviour and wants to warn others about the dangers of fizzy drinks. She said: 'To anyone who drinks quite a lot of fizzy drinks already, I'd urge them to be very aware of the potential extreme impact it can have on your life, like it has on mine.' Low-calorie fizzy drinks like Diet Coke can aid weight loss, but the chemicals used to make them can still cause health problems. Phosphoric acid is listed in the ingredients of Coke, Diet Coke, Pepsi, Diet Pepsi and Pepsi Max, as well as many own-brand colas. But while a certain amount of phosphorous is vital to bone and tooth health, scientists say excessive consumption raises the risk of developing brittle bones. The drinks also contain caffeine which in large quantities can stop the body from absorbing iron. And some experts have linked Diet Coke’s sweetening ingredient, aspartame, with premature birth and even cancer, although the EU food watchdog last year rejected the claims.","At one point, Jakki Ballan, 42, was drinking more than three cans an hour .

"Marvel Studios will release a special cut of the movie 'Iron Man 3' specifically for China . Chinese version of the film will also include special bonus footage, including an appearance by Chinese actress Fan Bingbing . Hollywood studios want access to billions of dollars that are guaranteed for films that become hits . Censors visited sets and even made creative suggestions . Disney eager to build business relationship in China through films and theme parks . A few years ago, making it big in Hollywood was all that mattered. Now, American film studios are looking to tap into a vast new audience in China - a country with more than 1.3 billion people. Instead of standing up to Chinese censorship, desperate to secure the release of 'Iron Man 3' in China, Disney is playing ball and allowed the country's censors to vet scripts, visit sets in the U.S. and even give suggestions on other creative decisions. Two Versions: Chinese audiences will see a specially adapted version of the movie 'Iron Man 3'. One that meets the approval of Chinese censors . China has become world’s second-largest film market, after the United States but so different are Chinese laws, customs and tastes that American studios will do whatever it takes to have their film distributed there - even if it means making a completely new movie. Disney has revealed that when it releases 'Iron Man 3' in a few weeks time there will be two separate versions of the superhero film. One for Chinese audiences; the other for the rest of the world. Hollywood executives are only just starting to figure out what works and what does not, with the 40-strong censorship board, consisting of Chinese Communist Party officials. Stars: Robert Downey Jr and Gwyneth Paltrow pose for photographers during the Iron in Paris last night. Similarly, the communist government wants Chinese studios to learn from Hollywood and is trying to attract foreign studios to form ventures by promising more market access and a bigger share of ticket sales. For the past decade, China's state-run film distributors have allowed in only 20 foreign films per year for national distribution. Which Hollywood films get the 'okay' in China is a murky and complicated process. Last week the American film 'Django Unchained' was pulled from theaters in China on its opening day. Flying the flag: It's not always America's interests at heart... Hollywood executives will do virtually anything to appease Chinese censors to have the film show in the country . Working out exactly what pleases the Chinese censors is a complex task. Many scenes in 'Iron Man 3' were shot, along with its stars Robert Downey Jr, Gwyneth Paltrow and Don Cheadle, in Beijing last December. The film was produced with DMG Entertainment, a Beijing-based production house. DMG is a Chinese company, with 900 employees in China and headquarters in Beijing. It means that the film could be almost be considered domestically Chinese which provides extra benefits. Local sights: Chinese actor Wang Xueqi waves during a promotional event for the Hollywood movie ''Iron Man 3''  at the Forbidden City in Beijing. The use of Chinese locations seems to go down well with the country's censorship board . To avoid any conflict close to the release date Disney has produced a version of Iron Man 3 that includes more Chinese-shot footage and recognizable locations that appeal to more local tastes. 'We know Chinese audiences love Iron Man. So we are going to add Chinese elements and a Chinese story into Iron Man 3,' Disney's general manager for Greater China, Stanley Cheung, said at a news conference before filming began last year. Chinese actor Wang Xueqi will appear in both versions along with the extra Beijing footage. China’s top actress, Fan Bingbing also appears in scenes specifically designed for Chinese viewers. Local talent: Chinese actress Fan Bingbing (L) and Chinese actor Wang Xueqi are both appearing in 'Iron Man 3' in scenes that were shot in their home country . Marvel described the move . in a statement as a 'springboard for future collaboration with China’s . talented stars and its growing film and television industry.' Hollywood . studios have long tried to stick to Chinese censorship rules when . releasing their pictures in the country but their demands can be . unpredictable and capricious. A scene from the new Brad Pitt movie World War Z had to be changed so as not to offend Chinese state censors. Last year, scenes that were shot in Shanghai for the James Bond film 'Skyfall' had to be cut. Scenes that portrayed the Chinese government as incompetent were removed. 'Men in Black 3', 'Pirates Of The Caribbean: At World’s End' and 'Mission: Impossible 3' were also edited. Superhuman: But the films producers had Chinese censors visit the set of the movie and even allow creative suggestions to be made during the filming of 'Iron Man 3' The difference with Iron Man 3 is that additional footage was added to appease Chinese sensitivities. Hollywood execs are eager not to upset Chinese censors and threaten distribution in the country, the fastest growing film market in the world. China is now a $2 billion-a-year market. More than 60 percent of box-office takings in 2012 so far came from non-Chinese pictures. Disney has said the experience of working with the Chinese censors was 'positive'. The company is looking to grow its business in the country as it build a brand new Disney theme park in Shanghai. A scene of things to come? China is an extremely lucrative market for U.S. filmmakers. We can expect more co-productions to be shot and shown in the world's most populated country . Marvel has said the filmmakers look forward to 'bringing ‘Iron Man’ back to China.' 'Iron Man 3' will have its UK premiere later this week before being released on 26th April. The film will be released in the US May 3rd. A Chinese release date has not yet been set.","Marvel Studios will release a special cut of the movie 'Iron Man 3' specifically for China .

"Offensive: The tattoo posted on Twitter by Manchester United fan Danny Hornby . A man has been arrested over alleged threats to a football fan who showed off his offensive tattoo about the Hillsborough disaster. Danny Hornby, from Fleetwood, Lancashire, was forced into hiding by death threats after posting a picture on his Twitter page of a tattoo on his back which reads '96wne'. The letters 'wne' are thought to stand for 'was not enough'. This was a sick reference to the 96 Reds . fans who died at the FA Cup semi final between Liverpool and Nottingham . Forest on April 15, 1989. The tattoo sparked outrage among internet users who threatened to injure and even kill him. Hornby, 22, reported to be a Manchester United fan, has apologised for the wording . and vowed to remove the tattoo. But police urged him to move out until . the uproar dies down. Police had to step in because . 22-year-old Hornby, from Fleetwood, Lancashire, feared for his life . after fleeing his home with his girlfriend. His . parents, mother Kath and father Garry and younger sister Laura, have . also moved out of the terrace house after the address was put on scores . of internet ­forums. It is understood he promised to cover up the tattoo and post a fresh image of his back on his Twitter page. Lancashire Constabulary has made an arrest in connection with inciteful comments that Mr Hornby received that were trying to encourage people to harm him. A police spokeswoman said: “A 20-year-old man from Fleetwood has been arrested on suspicion of intentionally encouraging/assisting the commission of an either way offence - incitement - in connection with comments made on a social media site and has been bailed pending further inquiries.” Liverpool fan Stephen Landers wrote on Hornby’s Twitter . page: 'It’s rather fitting the rat’s name is Hornby coz if I ever meet . him I’ll break the c***’s arms n legs n leave him on the tracks.' Another wrote: 'There would be a sense of irony if police had to identify Danny Hornby’s body by that tattoo.' The former fish packer pleaded on Twitter not to involve his family. He wrote:'It’s nothing to do with them. 'I am not in Fleetwood nor staying with family or friends. I wish to apologise to everyone I’ve offended with regard to the tattoo, which is now covered.' The Hillsborough Justice Campaign branded the stunt 'sad' but condemned the threats. A spokesman told the Daily Star: 'It’s sad that someone feels the need to decorate their body with such ­inflammatory ­comments. But we don’t condone any threats against him.' Tragedy: 96 fans were crushed to death at Hillsborough during the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest in 1989 .

"Homeowners in one Ohio town have found themselves living a real life American horror story. Thanks to an urban legend that claims the 'portal to hell' is located near some obscure storm drains in Blue Ash, Ohio, scores of feisty teens, horror fanatics, and folks who just like a good old scare flock there in scores, especially come Halloween. The problem is, this 'portal' is located on private property, and all the commotion is a major nuisance for the homeowners who actually own said property. Scroll down for video . To God's chamber: Some believe that the portal to hell (above) is located in a storm drain in Blue Ash, Ohio . Wet entrance: Unfortunately for some homeowners, that 'portal' is also on their private property, where scores of people flock to check out the urban legend . 'It’s rough on the homeowners,' Blue Ash Police Lt. Steve Schuelertold WCPO. 'People park in their driveway and try to get into the drainage system and nobody likes that. (The owner) has had to chase off some people, for sure.' The folklore surrounding the site dates back a few decades, to when some claim that those who worship the man down below practiced their religion in the area. 'A group of Satanists supposedly used to meet there in some type of altar room and conduct their rituals,' says Creepy Cincinnati blogger Rick Fenbers. 'They must have been pretty good, because the legend claims they managed to open a doorway to hell.' Urban legend: 'A group of Satanists supposedly used to meet there in some type of altar room and conduct their rituals,' says Creepy Cincinnati blogger Rick Fenbers . Watch your step: People sometimes park in the property owners driveways to explore, which is a nuisance . As a result, people report hearing screams, seeing floating faces and having contact with apparitions when around this spooky setting. It even got a seal of approval from ghost hunter and filmmaker David Scott, who filmed a visit to the site and called it, 'one of the scariest locations [he had] ever investigated.' Weird noises: The strange sounds heard could be chalked up to the various tunnels located underground and echoes . Light at the end: Some warn that a serious storm could cause visitors to drown in the storm pipes . So for anyone looking for a fright, or to glimpse a possible 'portal to hell,' this sounds like just the place - just make sure to keep down the noise out of respect for the neighbors. Or wait until Ryan Murphy uses this as the inspiration for an upcoming season of American Horror Story.","According to urban legend, the 'portal to hell' is located in a storm drain in Blue Ash, Ohio .

Three of the group's activists were sentenced to four months in prison last week after staging a topless protest in the country's capital demanding the release of a Tunisian FEMEN activist. Marguerite Stern and Pauline Hillier, from France, and Josephine Markmann, from Germany, were arrested on 29 May as they protested bare-chested in front of the Tunis Court building. The trio had approached the entrance to the ministry wearing coats which they took off, revealing naked torsos scrawled with 'Breasts Feed Revolution'. Wearing just jean shorts, the women chanted in English 'Free Amina' and 'Women's spring is coming' as people in the crowd attempted to cover them. The women then climbed up on the gates of the Justice Ministry until police pulled them down and hustled them shouting into the building as an angry crowd gathered.

"It is a remarkable fact that the difference in time between when the Stegosaurus and T-rex roamed the Earth is greater than the distance in time between the T-rex and today. And now one man has created an ingenious infographic to show the evolution of these dinosaurs in all their incredible diversity. The unusual circular diagram details the rise and fall of the Dinosauria from its appearance in the early Triassic, 231 million years ago, to its virtual total extinction at the end of the Cretaceous period 66 million years ago. Hover your mouse over the image below to read the infographic in detail . The infographic covers the rise and fall of Dinosauria, as shown on this timeline. Dinosaurs are thought to have been wiped out by a massive asteroid impact that created a dust cloud capable of blocking out sunlight for a year. It also released acidic gasses into the atmosphere, known as the Palaeogene extinction event . Dinosaurs are thought to have been wiped out by a massive asteroid impact. This impact created a dust cloud capable of blocking out sunlight for a year, as well as releasing acidic gasses into the atmosphere, commonly known as the Palaeogene extinction event. Three quarters of plant and animal life on Earth was annihilated, and the only dinosaurs to survive were those of the clade Avialae, which evolved into what we know today as birds. Graphic designer Simon Tyler, 36, took a staggering 180 hours to create his dinosaur family tree, based upon research from the Smithsonian Museum, the University of Michigan and the University of California, Berkeley. The design is known as a phylogenetic tree and Tyler’s creation starts in the centre from which the timeline and epochs radiate. Dinosurs first appeared in the early Triassic, 231 million years ago (illustrated) The circular diagram details the rise and fall of the Dinosauria from its appearance in the early Triassic, 231 million years ago, to its virtual total extinction at the end of the Cretaceous period 66 million years ago . Later therapods on the poster include the most well-known large carnivorous dinosaurs including Tyrannosaurus (pictured) Giganotosaurus and Spinosaurus . Graphic designer Simon Tyler, 36, took a staggering 180 hours to create his dinosaur family tree. These are the dinosaurs included on it . He chose this design to make it easy to see the wide range of dinosaur shapes and sizes that evolved around the later period of the tree – the Cretaceous – which is coloured in blue. The dinosaurs featured on the tree are ordered in size from the smallest to the largest and while they are in proportion, they are different scales as the creatures ranged from between 1.9ft (60cm) and 85ft (26 metres), which is impossible to fit on a tree, according to the designer. ‘There are obviously hundreds of distinct dinosaur species, and the selection on the poster was chosen to offer as wide representation of the differing forms and sizes at different points in time as possible,’ Tyler told MailOnline. The creature at the centre of the tree is Euparkeria, an archosauriform. The archosaur group eventually evolved into dinosaurs, so this creature marks the beginning of the family tree. It then splits into two branches – one for saurischian dinosaurs and the other being ornithischian dinosaurs. The distinction is based upon their differing hip structure. Saurischian . dinosaurs had hips like a lizard, whereas ornithischian dinosaurs had . hips more like modern birds, with a pubic bone pointing downwards . towards their tails. This is a little confusing as modern birds evolved . from the saurischia. An . early member of the group saurischia was Chindesaurus - a small . carnivorous beast that walked on two feet and measured 6.5ft (two metres) long. The design is known as a phylogenetic tree and Tyler's creation starts in the centre from which the timeline and epochs radiate . Sauropods such as Brachiosaurus (pictured) and Isisaurus are included in the family tree as well as Diplodocus and Apatosaurus (formerly known as Brontosaurus) This clade - a group of organisms consisting of an ancestor and all its descendants - included the largest land animals that have ever existed, the later members of which are known as titanosaurs. Sauropods such as Brachiosaurus and Isisaurus are included in the family tree as well as Diplodocus and Apatosaurus (formerly known as Brontosaurus). However, it also evolved in a different direction too, to include therapods, which were mainly carnivorous bipedal dinosaurs. Early therapods were quite small, such as Coelyphysis at 9.8ft (three metres) long, and Elaphrosaurus at 19.6ft (six metres). Later therapods include the most well-known large carnivorous dinosaurs including Tyrannosaurus, Giganotosaurus and Spinosaurus. Early therapods were quite small, such as Coelyphysis (pictured) at 9.8ft (three metres) long and Elaphrosaurus at 16.9ft (six metres) Shown on the right-hand side of the infographic, most herbivorous ornithischian dinosaurs evolved hard beaks. One of the earliest was Pisanosaurus which was around 3.2ft (one metre) long . Avialae - which evolved into modern birds - and coelurosauria - which include the Tyrannosaurus - are both parts of a clade known as avetherapoda. Avialae then branched off and is represented on the chart by Archaeopteryx – a feathered flying dinosaur around the size of a modern raven. Most herbivorous ornithischian dinosaurs, which are shown on the right-hand side of the graphic, evolved hard beaks. One of the earliest was Pisanosaurus, which was around 3.3ft (one metre) long. Like various other dinosaurs (including the therapod Coelyphysis on the graphic), Pisanosaurus is thought to have been at least partially feathered based on the recovered fossils. A group of dinosaurs known as ‘shield bearers’ because of their armoured skin, evolved into the group stegosauria – represented by Stegosaurus in the infographic – and ankylosauria. They all had very small brains considering their size. The brain of stegosaurus was around the same size as a modern dog’s, despite that fact the dinosaur was 29.5ft (nine metres) long. Meanwhile, non-armoured dinosaurs called ornithopoda – represented by Hypsilophodon and Zalmoxes – evolved an effective jaw structure for chewing grass, and grazed on plains. Another group called ceratopsia, which included Triceratops, existed towards the end of the Cretaceous period alongside therapod predators such as the T-rex and Giganotosaurus. The final group shown on the infographic is pachycephalosauria represented by a dinosaur called Dracorex. The dinosaur was bipedal with a heavily armoured body and spiky horns, which it probably used to head-butt predators.

They all had very small brains considering their size . Each dinosaur, such as this Hypsilophodon, took between six and eight hours to draw using Adobe Illustrator and are based on the most up-to-date thinking about how dinosaurs looked - particularly the feathered ones . The only known species of Dracorex is Dracorex hogwartsia, which was named by children because it resembles the fictional dragons in Harry Potter. There is a lot of information packed into one infographic, which is available as a poster from Tyler’s graphic design company Atomic Printworks for £25. Each dinosaur took between six and eight hours to draw using Adobe Illustrator and they are based on the most up-to-date thinking about how dinosaurs looked – particularly the feathered ones . ‘The colours are a tiny bit more playful, as it's pretty obvious that there's no way anyone could have truly accurate evidence of that kind,’ Tyler explained. He decided to make such detailed posters for children and adults alike after his two-year-old daughter asked him what a hydrothermal vent is. ‘I realised that kids are just like information sponges - if you present them with interesting things in a bright, clear and fun format, they absorb it so easily.’ Having studied biochemistry and the history of science at university, Tyler, of St Leonards-on-Sea in East Sussex, set to work creating accurate posters from dinosaurs to space shuttles. ‘I think the subject of dinosaurs is one of those amazing entry points into the wonders of natural science in that they're so bizarre and otherworldly that they captivate young minds,' he said. He plans on creating more posters about science, technology, engineering and maths as well as a series of illustrated books in which a chimp character called Professor Plasma will tackle quantum physics for the under-fives.

"The majority of Americans do not think President Barack Obama has been aggressive enough with the Islamic State, a poll released on Wednesday revealed. A resounding 74 percent described Obama's actions toward Islamic extremists as 'not tough enough.' And another 52 percent said they'd be in favor of allowing the president to use U.S. ground troops to take out ISIS if airstrikes in Iraq and Syria are not enough. Likely voters went a step further and told pollsters for Fox News that they're skeptical the president's plans to degrade and destroy the terrorist group will work at all without boots on the ground. Obama has categorically rejected the notion that he could ask American forces  to engage in combat in Iraq, but 58 percent of likely voters said they don't see a path to success if he doesn't. Nearly three-fourths of Americans think President Barack Obama, pictured here today speaking at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, has not been 'tough enough' on Islamic extremists . If President Obama changed course in Iraq and sent in U.S. ground troops, the majority of Americans would support him. In fact, most likely voters think he's going to have to if he wants to defeat ISIS . That's more than double the percentage of likely voters who said bombs alone would send ISIS packing, 23 percent, and three times the percentage who couldn't say one way or the other, 19 percent. Overall all respondents to Fox's survey, which was commissioned by Democratic polling firm Anderson Robbins Research and Republican firm Shaw & Company Research and conducted Sunday through Tuesday, were unhappy with nearly every single angle of President Obama's strategy to combat the terrorist group. Worse, nearly two-thirds of respondents - 64 percent - said they don't even think Obama has a 'clear strategy' for taking out the Islamic State, even though the President has repeatedly clarified that he does after inadvertently stating last summer that he didn't. Obama has since shared his plans with the American people.In a prime-time address last month, the president said his long-term strategy will rely on airstrikes against militants in Iraq and Syria, military aid to Iraqi and Kurdish forces, a training and weapons program to arm moderate Syrian rebels and a broad international coalition working together on a number of fronts. Yet 53 percent of respondents still say Obama's doing a bad job handling terrorist threats. The same percentage gave him poor marks on Iraq. Likewise, 54 percent of people polled said it was 'crazy' for the president to announce to the enemy that he wouldn't authorize U.S. ground forces under any circumstances. Just 34 percent said it was 'smart' to clue Americans in on planned military engagement. An alarming 80 percent of Americans said they are either very or somewhat concerned that ISIS is going to attack the United States i n the 'near future,' despite assurances from the Department of Homeland Security and other Obama administration officials that they've found no evidence to support that assessment. The only terrorist plot uncovered by the U.S. in recent months that it's shared with the public is one being plotted in Syria by the unrelated Khorason Group. Like ISIS it is an an off-shoot of al Qaeda but the two do not appear to be working together. The Pentagon announced late last month that it had preemptively struck the group in Syria as a preventative measure.","A resounding 74 percent described Obama's actions toward Islamic extremists as 'not tough enough'

"A British father-of-two was cleared today of pushing an Irish tourist to his death off a Tenerife booze cruise nearly 17 years ago. A Spanish jury acquitted kitchen fitter Darren Sapstead of any involvement in Garry Walton's drowning on November 7, 1996, after five hours of deliberations. The decision marked the end of a long fight by Mr Sapstead, from Woodham Ferrers, near Chelmsford, Essex, to clear his name. Cleared: Darren Sapstead celebrates after he was acquitted today of pushing Irish tourist Garry Walton to his death nearly 17 years ago . Hearing: Darren Sapstead walks past the Walton family on the day he was cleared of any involvement in the death of Garry Walton . He clapped his hands and shouted 'Yes' as his defence lawyer mouthed 'You're not guilty' in English seconds after the jury spokeswoman announced the unanimous 9-0 verdict in Spanish. Garry's builder dad Robert, 60, originally from Leeds, West Yorkshire, but now living in Tooraneena, Dungarvan, south east Ireland, buried his head in his hands and wife Catherine, 59, stared silently ahead with tears in her eyes. The distraught Walton family, who included Robert's sisters Debbie and Rachel, left the court in the Tenerife capital Santa Cruz afterwards by a back door without making any comment. Darren, 38, extradited to Spain in 2005 and remanded in jail in Spain for eight months before being released and allowed to return to Britain on bail ahead of his three-day trial, said: 'Justice has been served at the end of the day. 'The feeling I have is indescribable. 'It's been a long time but the truth has finally come out in the end. Family: Garry Walton's father (pictured right at the court today) buried his head in his hands when the verdict came through . Distraught: Robert Walton, pictured with his family arriving at the court today, left the hearing without making any comment following the verdict . 'My statements on what happened the night Garry died never changed.' Darren, whose wife Joanne, son Nathan, 10, and daughter Nicole, 16, stayed behind in the UK, said: 'I'm going to phone my family to give them the good news, go and eat a big T-bone steak to celebrate and then get on the first plane back home. 'I just want now to try to rebuild my shattered life. 'I lost a £300,000 business because of . the time I was in jail in Spain and I've spent thousands of pounds . trying to clear my name. 'No nearer': Garry's father Robert later said: 'A guilty verdict wouldn't have brought back our dear son.But we're still no nearer knowing why he died so in that respect we're where we were 17 years ago' Justice: After the jury returned their verdict today, Mr Sapstead said, 'Justice has been served at the end of the day. The feeling I have is indescribable' 'I also lost a lot of time with my children when they were growing up. 'I feel sorry for Garry's family and I can understand why they're angry. 'But they're blaming the wrong person. I don't know who if anyone killed their son but it wasn't me. 'The Spanish justice system is a joke. Nearly 17 years this has gone on for and there was no evidence. 'It should be innocent until proven guilty but I feel as if it's been the other way round.' The jurors were not asked to rule if Garry had died by accident or as a result of a crime. Drowned: Gary Walton had been on a party boat 'booze cruise' seventeen years ago before he drowned . Trial: Darren Sapstead, pictured left in court earlier this week , denied pushing Garry Walton, right, to his death over the . side of a pleasure boat in Tenerife 1996. The trial began on Monday, 17 . years after Mr Walton died . Distress: The long-awaited trial comes after a protracted campaign by Garry's parents Robert and Catherine to unlock the mystery of their son's death . The jury spokesman said they had reached their decision to clear Mr Sapstead of any involvement because of contradictions in the witness statements of two British sisters who only incriminated him nearly a year later, expert forensic evidence Garry's body showed no signs of violence, and the fact the defendant had never changed his story. Mr Sapstead was one of only five of the estimated 45 people on board booze cruise vessel Batros questioned by police the night Garry, 21, drowned off the popular resort of Playa de Las Americas. He was allowed to return to Britain two days later and only the two British sisters, Katie and Lucy Smethurst, faced a second court quiz on the island. The probe into Garry's death, initially . classed as an accident by Spanish investigators, was reopened after the . women accused Mr Sapstead of killing him in fresh statements they made . to Manchester Police in September 1997. Agony: The victim's father Robert Walton was in the Tenerife courtroom to watch the trial . They had said in previous statements Mr Sapstead was not responsible. He was extradited to Spain in December 2005 and remanded in jail before being allowed to return to the UK on bail while an investigating judge in Tenerife continued to probe Garry's death. He was charged with intentionally killing Garry earlier this year and ordered to stand trial. State prosecutors said they wanted Darren jailed for up to 12 years if he was convicted of Garry's homicide at the start of the trial on Monday. They accused him of asking Katie . Smethurst, 'Shall I throw him overboard?' as Garry staggered up to them . drunk after alcohol-fuelled games before grabbing him and throwing him . over the side of the boat. The tourist's body was found around two hours later by another vessel. Fight: Robert and Catharine Walton have been seeking justice for their son's death for 17 years . Mr Sapstead insisted he had nothing to do with Garry's death and told the court he was the only one who had tried to help him by throwing him a life ring and preparing to jump into the water when he saw him in difficulties. His defence lawyer Carlos Valenciano accused the Smethurst sisters of lying by incriminating Darren ten months after Garry's death to deflect attention from Katie's involvement in the incident and her fear she would be accused of killing him. Garry's campaigning parents Robert and Catherine attended every day of court and were joined today by Robert's two sisters. Speaking after the hearing, Garry's father said: . 'We are obviously devastated but we will live with this. All we ever . wanted was a trial and we got that.  We just want to get back to Ireland . now and try to put this behind us. Return: Mr Sapstead voluntarily returned to Spain to stand trial . 'A guilty verdict wouldn't have . brought back our dear son. But we're still no nearer knowing why he died . so in that respect we're where we were 17 years ago. 'This case took far too long to come . to court but the state prosecutor Debora Padilla gave such a fantastic . and damning account in court of what happened the night our son died. 'And we've got a friend for life in our lawyer Pedro Ripoll. He's been a real rock of support.' They had to exhume Garry's body 10 months after his burial when evidence came to light casting doubt on the original ruling his death was an accident. An investigating judge in Tenerife shelved the case against Mr Sapstead three times - only to reopen it after repeated appeals by the couple's lawyer Pedro Ripoll. Hearing: Proceedings opened on Monday after a long-running legal battle over Mr Walton's death . Mr Ripoll retired in 2007 - and both he and Garry's parents only found out by chance this week's trial had been scheduled. The Waltons have become grandparents five times since the death of their son - and Mr Sapstead has become a father twice with his eldest daughter now studying for her GSCEs. Speaking outside court earlier this week out-of-work builder Mr Walton, who moved with his family to Ireland when Garry was a child, said: 'It's mixed feelings at the moment. 'We're over the moon on the one hand. 'We'd given up on things ever getting this far after so many kicks in the teeth and we've been pinching ourselves the last few days to make sure it's true.' 'But we're also disgusted it's taken so long. It's inexplicable. We've been treated like dirt by the Spanish authorities. My son deserved better than this.' Garry Walton died after falling from the Albatros off the coast of Tenerife, pictured . Speaking two years after his son's death, he said: 'We won't stop till we discover the truth. We owe it to Garry. 'It only needs one person to speak and the police will reopen the case. 'Garry was the most gentle loving and honest boy you could meet. 'He'd been looking forward to the holiday for ages, and he rang home to tell us he was having a brilliant time. 'He said he was going on a boat trip. That trip cost him his life.'","Darren Sapstead cleared of pushing Garry Walton to his death .

"Killed: Aaron Tuneberg, 30, pictured, was brutally beaten at his Boulder home in Colorado for his Xbox . Two teenage boys have been charged with first degree murder after they allegedly beat a mentally disabled man to death with a baseball bat and golf club for his Xbox console. Austin Holford and Luke Pelham, both 18, were in court on Monday to face charges after the brutal assault on 30-year-old Aaron Tuneberg in Boulder, Colorado. Prosecutors upgraded those charges to murder today after Mr Tuneberg died. Police claim the pair beat the 30-year-old vicitm unconscious during the robbery of his Xbox at his home on March 31. The victim's family gave a statement to Daily Camera, which read that the 30-year-old was 'vulnerable, innocent and unable to discern danger'. They added: 'Our family is devastated by this . senseless tragedy. 'We want you to know that at the heart of this is a . wonderful man named Aaron, who is a beloved son, brother and uncle.' It was originally claimed by the defendants that Holford hit the victim with an aluminum bat while Pelham stood watch outside with a golf club. However forensic experts said on Monday that Mr Tuneberg's wounds revealed that he had also been hit with the club.

Pelham's attorney Benjamin Collett said that his client suffers from Klinefelter syndrome, leaving him with the mental capacity of a young boy so jail would be incredibly damaging. Mr Collett said his client's condition would have also made him easy to exploit and that his client eventually called the police to Mr Tuneberg's apartment. The attorney said that his client was convinced to take part after Holford told him that Mr Tuneberg had assaulted his girlfriend.

"A judge has denied custody to white supremacist Heath Campbell, the New Jersey man who attended a court hearing last month dressed in a full Nazi uniform as he sought to get back his youngest child. Campbell, 40, is father to eight children by four different women. He lives off of government assistance and his current fiancee is expecting his ninth child later this year. He attended the June hearing held at Hunterdon County Family Court in Flemington, N.J., to determine whether he  could visit with his 2-year-old son Heinrich Hons.

Campbell, 40, is father to eight children by four different women and his current fiancee, right, is expecting his ninth child later this year . Heinrich Hons was the fourth child - all with Nazi-inspired names - that Campbell had with his last wife Deborah. He was removed from his parents just hours . after being born in November 2011. The . New Jersey Division of Youth and Family Services said they . took the boy because violence in the home. They had already placed the couple's other three children – Adolf Hitler Campbell, 7, JoyceLynn Aryan Nation Campbell, 6, . and 5-year-old Honzlynn Jeannie Campbell – in foster care because of . the alleged violence in the family's Holland Township, N.J. home.

Campbell has said he will appeal Thursday’s decision, reports NBC 10. Deborah Campbell gave up rights to her children after separating from her husband. The Nazi-inspired names first came to light . after a store refused to decorate a birthday cake reading 'Happy . birthday Adolf Hitler' in December 2008. In 2010, a . New Jersey appeals court ruled there was sufficient evidence of abuse . or neglect due to prior domestic violence to seize the children. Authorities insisted putting the children into care had nothing to do with their names. Court records from previous hearings show that the oldest child, Adolf, frequently threatened to kill people.

"A former high-ranking Obama administration official writes in his forthcoming memoir that the White House was 'so eager to rid itself of Iraq' that advisers steered the president toward withdrawing all U.S troops instead of trying to ink an agreement to let them legally stay past 2011. Leon Panetta, Obama's first CIA director and his second Defense secretary, writes in the book 'Worthy Fights: A Memoir of Leadership in War and Peace' that Obama's inner circle lacked a sense of urgency about finalizing a deal with Iraq's then-Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. 'To my frustration,' Panetta writes, 'the White House coordinated the negotiations but never really led them,' leaving the Defense and State Departments to proceed 'without the President’s active advocacy.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Leon Panetta, Obama's first CIA director and his second Defense Secretary, now says the White House is to blame for failing to iron out an agreement that would have left some American troops in Iraq . With the ISIS terror army filling the power vacuum left by the US after 2011, Obama has been forced to return to Iraq with airstrikes while negotiating with Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi (left, shown Sept. 24 at the UN) The U.S. wasn't willing to allow soldiers and Marines to stay past Obama's drawdown deadline – the end of 2011 – without A Status Of Forces Agreement, which would have protected U.S. military personnel from legal prosecution by Iraq's notoriously arbitrary and vicious justice system. Al-Maliki, according to Panetta, insisted that his nation's divided and fiercely sectarian Parliament needed to debate and approve any such agreement. That, he writes in 'Worthy Fights,' put the deal in limbo and left the White House wringing its hands even though the leaders of all Iraq's skirmishing factions wanted the U.S. to stay, in some form, as a backstop against opportunistic jihadis. Fighting words: Panetta's book goes on sale Oct. 7 . 'To this day,' Panetta insists, 'I believe that a small U.S. troop presence in Iraq could have effectively advised the Iraqi military on how to deal with al-Qaeda’s resurgence and the sectarian violence that has engulfed the country.' Time magazine published a short excerpt from the book on Wednesday evening. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters on Thursday during her regular daily briefing that the U.S. 'didn’t have the requirements needed to leave our troops there' at the time.' The administration, she said, 'was certainly committed to doing everything we could to secure the requirements needed to have forces there. Obviously, we were unable to do that.' Panetta disagrees, writing that the administration ignored 'leverage' the U.S. had over al-Maliki in the form of reconstruction aid dollars. 'My fear, as I voiced to the President and others,' he writes, 'was that if the country split apart or slid back into the violence that we’d seen in the years immediately following the U.S. invasion, it could become a new haven for terrorists to plot attacks against the U.S.' 'I privately and publicly advocated for a residual force that could provide training and security for Iraq’s military.' But although the Joint Chiefs of Staff and military commanders on the ground in Iraq agreed, 'the president’s team at the White House pushed back, and the differences occasionally became heated.' 'Those on our side,' Panetta says, 'viewed the White House as so eager to rid itself of Iraq that it was willing to withdraw rather than lock in arrangements that would preserve our influence and interests.' The self-styled Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) has murdered tens of thousands and turned millions more into refugees as it plows through Iraw and Syria . Panetta writes in his book that he and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey urged the president to arm Syria's moderate rebels in 2012 but Obama demurred – only to do it in 2014 after the civil war there intensified . Panetta's book ruffled its first feathers two weeks ago when '60 Minutes' reported that he and the rest of Obama's national security team had urged the president in 2012 to arm moderate Syrian rebel groups hostile to dictator Bashar al-Assad. Obama, Panetta wrote, overruled them all. More recently, with two additional years of civil war in the rear-view mirror, Obama has secured $500 million from Congress to 'train and equip' the rebels. 'I think that would've helped' in 2012, Panetta told 60 Minutes' during a Sept. 21 broadcast. 'And I think, in part, we pay the price for not doing that in what we see happening with ISIS.' He also hinted at his belief that a less-complete troop pullout at the end of 2011 'would've given us greater leverage over Iraq's government.","Leon Panetta, who ran the CIA and the Defense Department for Obama, argued for a 'residual force' to stay behind in Iraq to stabilize the country .

"The flag over the Taliban's Qatar office was reportedly still flying today despite the U.S. government's promise to its Afghan counterparts that it would be removed. Afghan president Hamid Karzai has already promised to boycott peace talks, and the Taliban styling their Doha office as a diplomatic mission risked worsening tensions. As well as the flag, the newly opened office in Doha where talks between the fundamentalist group and the U.S. are due begin had opened with a sign announcing the 'Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan'. After objections that was later replaced with one that read, simply: 'Political office of the Taliban'. Afghan President Hamid Karzai said his government has suspended negotiations on a security deal in protest at the not being included in initial peace talks with the Taliban . Suspension comes just 12 hours after U.S. said it would hold talks with the Taliban at its newly opened office . U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry had also promised Afghan officials that the flag would be removed, but today it was still flying, albeit on a shorter flagpole, according to the BBC. Mr Karzai is understood to feel . betrayed by the failure of U.S. officials to extract commitments from the . Taliban to engage with the Afghan government, recognise the constitution . and renounce violence before the talks took place. In protest that the peace process was . not being 'Afghan-led', Mr Karzai also suspended meetings on allowing . 9,000 US and 6,000 allied troops to remain in Afghanistan following . Nato's withdrawal in 2014. He suspended both sets of talks after the deaths of four US soldiers in a rocket attack at the Bagram airbase outside Kabul. The Taliban claimed responsibility and . the attack fuelled concerns that a peace deal could hand Afghanistan . back to the extremists who have killed 444 British troops since 2001. Aimal Faizi, Mr Karzai's spokesman, . said: 'There is a contradiction between what the US government says and . what it does regarding Afghanistan peace talks.' Meanwhile, it has emerged that the . Taliban are ready to free a U.S. soldier held captive since 2009 in . exchange for five of their senior operatives imprisoned at Guantanamo . Bay, a senior spokesman for the group said today. The only known American soldier held . captive from the Afghan war is U.S. Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl of . Hailey, Idaho. He disappeared from his base in southeastern Afghanistan . on June 30, 2009, and is believed held in Pakistan. In an exclusive telephone interview . with The Associated Press from his Doha office, Taliban spokesman . Shaheen Suhail said that Sergeant Bergdahl 'is, as far as I know, in . good condition.' 'He is, as far as I know, in good condition': Shaheen Suhail said U.S. Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl (pictured) could be freed in exchange for five of senior Taliban fighters currently imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay . Among the five prisoners the Taliban . have consistently requested are Khairullah Khairkhwa, a former Taliban . governor of Herat, and Mullah Mohammed Fazl, a former top Taliban . military commander, both of whom have been held for more than a decade. Sergeant Bergdahl's parents earlier . this month received a letter from their son who turned 27 on March 28 . through the International Committee of the Red Cross. They did not release details of the . letter but renewed their plea for his release. The soldier's captivity . has been marked by only sporadic releases of videos and information . about his whereabouts. The prisoner exchange is the first . item on the Taliban's agenda before even opening peace talks, saidn Mr . Suhail, who is a top Taliban figure and served as first secretary at the . Afghan Embassy in the Pakistani capital of Islamabad before the Taliban . government's ouster in 2001. 'First has to be the release of . detainees,' Mr Suhail said when asked about the captive sergeant. 'Yes. It would be an exchange. Then step by step, we want to build bridges of . confidence to go forward.' Tensions are high after four soldiers were killed by the Taliban at the Bagram Air Base (pictured) The US announced . negotiations with the Taliban on the same day that Nato handed over . security for the country to the Afghan government. US President Barack Obama said: . 'Ultimately, we're going to need to see Afghans talking to Afghans about . how they can end the cycle of violence.' Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said the insurgents . fired two rockets into the base outside the Afghan capital, Kabul, late last night. American officials confirmed the base had come under attack . by indirect fire — likely a mortar or rocket — and that four U.S. troops . were killed . The Karzai announcement and the . latest attack may hamper the peace process just 12 hours after the U.S. announced the milestone negotiations due to be held in Doha. In a statement from his office, Karzai said negotiations with the . U.S. on what American and coalition security forces will remain in the . country after 2014 have been put on hold. The deal was expected to . define the future of American troops here and also pave way for billions . in aid to the Afghan economy. Karzai's statement followed an announcement yesterday by the U.S. and the . Taliban that they would pursue bilateral talks in Qatar before the . Afghan government was brought in. He . said: 'In view of the contradiction between acts and the statements . made by the United States of America in regard to the peace process, the . Afghan government suspended the negotiations, currently underway in . Kabul between Afghan and U.S. delegations on the bilateral security . agreement.' The U.S. said it would negotiate with the Taliban at the group's offices in Doha, Qatar. Pictured. Qatari Assistant Foreign Minister Ali bin Fahad Al-Hajri (right) and Taliban official Jan Mohammad Madani (left) one of the Taliban officials . The Taliban said yesterday they would open a 'political office' in Qatar to conduct peace talks on Afghanistan . The U.S. Embassy in Kabul said it has no immediate comment. The . Taliban indicated yesterday that they would be willing to talk with the . Afghan leader despite previously dismissing him as an Afghan puppet. But both the American side and the Taliban said they would first meet together before any talks with the Afghanistan government. The Taliban has opened a political office in Doha with the intention of . starting peace talks, which was a reversal of months of failed efforts to start . negotiations. President Barack Obama cautioned that the peace talks with the Taliban . would be neither quick nor easy but that their opening a political . office in Doha was an 'important first step toward reconciliation' between the Islamic militants and the government of Afghanistan. It is not clear how long Karzai plans to suspend negotiations on the NATO agreement for. The . security handover is due to pave the way for the departure of the . majority of coalition forces - currently numbering about 100,000 troops . from 48 countries, including 66,000 Americans - within 18 months. The . NATO-led force is to be cut in half by the end of the year, and by the . end of 2014 all combat troops are to leave and be replaced — contingent . on Afghan governmental approval — by a smaller force that would be on . hand for training and advising. NATO troops are to be cut in half in the coming months with Afghanistan taking control of security . The . U.S. has not yet said how many troops will remain in Afghanistan, but . it is thought that it would be a force made up of about 9,000 Americans . and 6,000 allies. Six years . ago, Afghan security forces numbered fewer than 40,000, and have grown . to about 352,000 today. But questions remain if they are good enough to . fight alone. The Afghan Taliban has said it wants a political solution to the 12-year war that would bring about a just . government and end foreign occupation. Taliban . officials held secret negotiations in Norway over the past few months . that played a significant role in the opening of the Taliban's Qatari . office, foreign minister Espen Barth Eide told state broadcaster NRK. In setting up the office, the . Taliban said they were willing to use all legal means to end what they . called the occupation of Afghanistan — but did not say they would . immediately stop fighting. American officials said the U.S. and . Taliban representatives will hold bilateral meetings in the coming days. Karzai's High Peace Council had been expected to follow up with its own . talks with the Taliban a few days later but it was now not clear . whether that would happen. The Afghan Army has swelled in size since 2007, and now numbers more than 350,000 . Yesterday, a formal agreement meant Afghans will now have the lead for security in all 403 districts of Afghanistan's 34 provinces. Until now, they were responsible for 312 districts nationwide, where 80 per cent of Afghanistan's population of nearly 30 million lives. Afghan security forces were until now carrying out 90 per cent of military operations around the country. Foreign forces will continue to support Afghans on the battlefield when they require it, but the Afghan army and police will be responsible for planning and leading military operations against the insurgency. 'As your forces step forward across the country, the main effort of our forces is shifting from combat to support. We will continue to help Afghan troops in operations if needed. But we will no longer plan, execute or lead those operations. And by the end of 2014, our combat mission will be completed. At that time, Afghanistan will be fully secured by Afghans,' NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said. Called 'Resolute Support,' Rasmussen . said the goal of the new mission 'is to train, advise and assist Afghan . forces. We will also play our part in the broader international efforts, . to ensure the long-term sustainment of the Afghan security forces. This . will be another visible demonstration that Afghanistan does not stand . alone, now or in the future.' The U.S. and its allies have already pledged to fund the Afghan forces in the immediate years after 2015.

"A Chinese stunt driver has broken the world record for parallel parking by squeezing into a space just 3.15in bigger than his car. Han Yue slid his Mini 3-door hatch into the tiny space with barely more than an inch and a half to spare on either side to claim the new world record at the China Drift Championship in Chongqing. He beat the previous world record, set by British driver Alistair Moffatt, by just over half a centimetre. Experts had thought Mr Moffatt's record of 3.4in spare was unbeatable. A tight spot: The parking space that Han Yue managed to manoeuvre his Mini into to break the Guinness World Record for the tightest parallel parking job, shaving 0.6cm of the previous record . Mr Han, who had previously held the record before Mr Moffatt took it in July 2013, achieved his incredible parking job with a power drift into the gap between the cars. Video footage of the feat showed him driving in a curve towards the space at fairly high speed, before at the last moment activating the handbrake and sliding his vehicle into the tight space. Mr Han's record is the latest in a quick escalation of parallel parking feats. As recently as 2012 the record for space to spare in a parallel park was 8.26in - more than double today's standard. He set the record on Friday, a day earlier than scheduled after rain was forecast to fall on Chongqing on Saturday. Moving in: Mr Han began his manoeuvre by accelerating in a circle towards the parking spot . Handbrake turn: He activates the car's handbrake once the front is in the perfect position . Super skid: Suddenly brought to a halt, the momentum of the car swings it into position in the tiny space . Perfect! Mr Han managed to park his vehicle with the merest hint of clearance to the one behind . But Mr Han didn't stop there. He also teamed up with fellow stunt driver Zhang Shengjun to take the rather unusual record for the most donut spins around a car driving on two wheels. Han told Guinness World Records his motivation for the attempts was to bring the parallel parking record back to China and highlight that his nation has world-leading drivers. Footage of his second record-breaking feat can be viewed on that website.","Han Yue retook record snatched from him by Briton Alistair Moffatt in 2013 .

"'Unfair advantage': Prince Charles is facing fresh scrutiny over his finances - with MPs claiming his tax payments are not transparent . Prince Charles is facing fresh scrutiny over his finances, as MPs claimed his tax payments are not transparent and the way he is funded may offer an ‘unfair advantage’. A powerful committee said the Duchy of Cornwall, the private estate of lucrative land and property holdings which paid the Prince a record income of £19milion last year, does not pay businesses taxes. And while they praised the heir to the throne for voluntarily agreeing to pay income tax, he was accused of disguising the exact rate he pays by lumping it together with his VAT. Margaret Hodge, chair of the Commons Public Accounts Committee, said a number of steps needed to be taken to bring the Duchy ‘more in line with the expectations of the present day.’ The Duchy, worth £847million, is not liable for corporation tax or capital gains tax. Mrs Hodge said: ‘The Duchy enjoys an exemption from paying tax even though it engages in a range of commercial activities. This tax exemption my give it an unfair advantage over its competitors who do pay corporation tax and capital gains tax. ‘The Treasury should examine whether the Duchy’s tax exemption creates an unlevel playing field.’ Clarence House denied this was the case. A spokesman said: ‘As we explained in the PAC hearing, we do not believe we have a competitive advantage. The Duke of Cornwall’s income is taxed at income tax rates. ‘The Duchy is not subject to corporation tax and the Duchy is not a corporation. The Duchy is exempt from any tax on capital gains, any capital gains have to be reinvested in the business and cannot be distributed.’ MPs claimed in their report on the Duchy of Cornwall published today that it was ‘not transparent precisely how much and what rate of income tax is paid by the Prince of Wales'. Extensive: The Duchy of Cornwall comprises more than 50,000 acres of land in 24 countries, including The Oval cricket ground in London, pictured above . He paid £4.4million in tax last year – and they acknowledged the ‘vast majority’ of it was income tax. But earlier this year the committee accused the prince of paying a lower tax rate – at 23.6pc – than his domestic servants. In this report they call for the two payments to be disclosed separately, and also accused the Treasury of failing to scrutinise the Duchy’s finances rather than relying only on reports from estate officials. But Mrs Hodge said the Duchy of Cornwall - which comprises more than 50,000 acres in land in 24 countries including The Oval cricket ground in London as well as lucrative investments - had ‘performed well’ in 2012-13. Action: Margaret Hodge, chair of the Commons Public Accounts Committee, said steps needed to be taken to bring the Duchy 'more in line with the expectations of the present day' It increased its total income to £28.8million and produced an overall surplus of £19.1million. Last night one of the country’s leading tax experts, who did not wish to be named, blasted the committee’s report saying they were mistaken in suggesting the Duchy should pay businesses taxes and accused the committee of ‘ill- informed financial showboating’. ‘It disappoints me that they have perpetuated this error in suggesting that the Duchy ought to pay a corporation tax’, the expert said. ‘It is not a corporation. It is a private estate, a private dukedom on which the beneficiary pays income tax. In actual fact the Prince of Wales doesn’t have to even do that but does so voluntarily.’ He said the one area where he agreed with the committee was on the amount of tax the prince was allowed to write off as expenses – which was £10.9million, or more than half his income. ‘I don’t think many private clients would be given such a generous expense allowance. And I also agree with them in their argument about separating the prince’s VAT and income tax. They are very different things and there is no logical reason for lumping them together’, he said. In a July session of the committee, Labour MP Austin Mitchell claimed the prince was paying a lower tax rate than his servants. He claimed Charles’ payment of 23.6pc of his income in direct and indirect taxes compared with 38 per cent paid by the poorest quarter of the population.","Prince Charles's tax payments are not transparent, claim MPs .

"Paul Pogba has signed a new improved contract with Juventus which will keep him with the Serie A giants until June 2019, the Turin club announced on Friday.

"As the star of three European Cup wins with Liverpool between 1978 and 1984, Kenny Dalglish knows exactly how difficult it is to maintain success at the very highest level of football. But, even so, Scotland’s greatest-ever player admits to being genuinely stunned at just how speedily Inter Milan’s players have gone from dipping their toes in the pool of sporting immortality to, in Dalglish’s own words, ‘tumbling down the water slide’ to ignominy and crisis. Back in 2010, the Italian giants were crowned Champions League winners, swatting away the mighty Barcelona at the peak of their powers on the road to conquering the continent under Jose Mourinho. Xherdan Shakiri (second right) celebrates with Inter team-mates during their match against Atalanta . Kenny Dalglish believes that the Italian giants have fallen from grace in recent years . Just five years later, however, they are mere Serie A strugglers under the faltering stewardship of former Manchester City boss Roberto Mancini. It represents quite a fall for such a proud and famous institution. Few gave Celtic a prayer of progressing when the teams were paired in the draw for the last-32 of the Europa League. But Ronny Deila’s side have come on leaps and bounds in recent weeks and, ahead of Inter’s visit to Celtic Park for the first leg on Thursday, Dalglish sees no reason why his old team should fear a fixture that conjures up so many happy memories for the Glasgow club. Inter, naturally, will still be tough to push past if Celtic are to reach the last 16. But 63-year-old Dalglish feels Deila’s improving side have at least a fighting chance of updating the history books with another famous victory over the club side Jock Stein’s men dispatched in Lisbon in 1967 to become the first British team ever to lift the European Cup. ‘There’s been a demise at Inter Milan,’ said Dalglish. Stats from Squawka . Jose Mourinho holds up the Champions League trophy as Inter Milan manager in 2010 . But Inter are currently languishing in midtable in Seria A under current boss Roberto Mancini . ‘It was only in 2010 that they won the Champions League under Jose Mourinho in Madrid. But it’s been like going down a water slide for them ever since. ‘Five years later and they are lying tenth in Serie A? They haven’t been great. ‘They’re definitely not as strong as they used to be. They’ve brought in Mancini but he’s had one or two setbacks, too. They haven’t done as well as they expected with him coming in but he still knows how to win games. He’s done exceptionally well in the past (at Manchester City and a previous spell at Inter) and it’s still going to be exceptionally difficult for Celtic. ‘But while Celtic had a hard time in the Champions League earlier this season they have stayed patient, they have regrouped and they have done well in the Europa League. They’ve got a chance. ‘In the end, it doesn’t matter what Inter are like back in Italy. It’s about what they are like in the Europa League. But I think it will be a good game, a fantastic occasion and a brilliant atmosphere.’ The first-ever meeting of Celtic and Inter, in Lisbon back in 1967, remains the high water mark in Scottish club football. After falling behind to Sandro Mazzola’s penalty, Stein’s Celtic – playing what the manager later described as ‘pure, beautiful, inventive football’ – triumphed over the Italian masters of defending with goals from Tommy Gemmell and Stevie Chalmers. The only other two competitive meetings to date between the Scots and the Italians went less well for the Parkhead club. In the European Cup semi finals in 1972, the classic Italian Catenaccio prevailed. After two goalless draws, Dixie Deans – on as a substitute for Dalglish - missed the vital penalty in a 5-4 shootout defeat. Celtic captain Billy McNeill leads his side out for the European Cup final in Lisbon in 1967 . McNeil lifts the trophy after Celtic beat Inter Milan 2-1 to secure victory . It cost Stein and Celtic what would have been a third appearance in the final, against Ajax in Rotterdam, after they were defeated by Feyenoord at the San Siro in 1970’s showpiece. As a further reminder that the past is a foreign country, on the same night in 1972 that 75,000 were inside Parkhead for the Inter Milan game, 80,000 crammed into Ibrox as Rangers beat Bayern Munich 2-0 on their way to winning the European Cup Winners’ Cup. If April 19, 1972 made for an unforgettable evening of sport for the city of Glasgow, however, it does not remain uppermost in the memory of Dalglish. He, admittedly, has far happier memories of his own in the competition, including scoring the only goal of the 1978 final for Liverpool against Club Brugge of Belgium at Wembley. ‘The shoot-out at Parkhead in 1972 wasn’t great – but I can’t actually remember anything about the game,’ confessed Dalglish. ‘I wouldn’t know if we hit the post four times or if our goalie was magnificent. I couldn’t tell you a thing! ‘Would I like to see Celtic get revenge for the defeat in 1972? Well, maybe at the time Inter thought that was their revenge for 1967. That had been a real shock for them. They were expected to win easily in Lisbon and they even went 1-0 up before losing. ‘But they got their own back that night in 1972. It’s 1-1 between the teams just now so we’ll keep batting it backwards and forwards. But this match is going to be a massively romantic game with all the memories of 1967. It’s going to be some night alright.’ *Kenny Dalglish is urging local communities to recognise a #GrassrootsHero and nominate them for the 2015 Scottish FA Grassroots Awards, presented by McDonald’ s.

"A dating expert set out to find out exactly what attracts men to women on Tinder, and ended up proving men can be as superficial as feared when it comes to choosing matches. Hayley Quinn set up two contrasting profiles, using doctored images of herself and a 'dumbed down'  bio on one on to find out whether men preferred the real her - or a more superficial 'sexy' version of herself. The London-based dating pro tested the relationship between the type of attention women get on Tinder in relation to the type of profile they created. Hayley created two contrasting profiles on the dating app; one for 'real' Hayley (left) and one for her sexed up alter ego 'Sonia' (right) The 27-year-old created two accounts - with the first for 'normal Hayley' describing herself as a yoga and hiking geek, who loves peanut butter and runs her own business. The first account also used photographs that showed Hayley on holiday abroad or in everyday situations, such as after a workout at the gym. The profile for fictitious 'Sonia' was then given the 'ultimate Tinder selfie makeover' with false eyelashes, hair extensions and ample cleavage on show, as well as enhancing the photos with various filters. And the much more simplistic bio simply read: 'Love life. Love my friends. Xoxo'. Video courtesy of London Dating Coach . 'Sonia' was then given the 'ultimate Tinder selfie makeover' with false eyelashes, hair extensions and ample cleavage on show .

Perhaps unsurprisingly she had  most success as 'Sonia' - the profile which used her heavily altered images. The first profile for Hayley received 195 matches while Sonia who received 324 matches.

The first profile for Hayley received 195 matches - but this was beaten by Sonia who received 324 matches . But while the 'sexier' profile got the most male attention - Hayley found that men were more genuinely interested in her and interacted more with the profile that listed her interests and hobbies. Hayley, who has helped more than 100,000 men find love, said: 'I decided to do the video because we live in a world that is lived out online. 'I was concerned that people were buying into a fake 'perfect' version of reality: rather than focusing on the real life changes that could find them a better partner. 'I was pleasantly surprised though that although the fake 'sexy' profile did better, there seemed to be more sincere interest in 'real' Hayley. 'The message seemed to be whatever you put out there will come right back to you.'

"The Queensland nurse at the centre of last week's Ebola scare has warned the world must do 'so much more' to stop the deadly virus before it gets out of control. Sue Ellen Kovack, 57, said it was a 'huge relief' to be released from Cairns Hospital early on Monday morning, after she tested negative for the illness for a second time. Ms Kovack had recently returned from working as a volunteer nurse in Sierra Leone when she came down with a fever last week. Scroll down for video . Sue Ellen Kovack volunteered as a nurse treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone last month . Ms Kovack posted a number of snaps of her on the job in Sierra Leone on her Facebook page . There are an estimated 7,200 Ebola cases in West Africa, according to the latest figures from the World Health organisation . Despite criticism from Federal MP Bob Katter last week that Australian aid workers were putting the nation at risk, Ms Kovack said medical professionals should head overseas to fight the illness. In a statement, Ms Kovack said she would like to 'bring the focus back' to the tens of thousands of people affected by Ebola in West Africa. 'The international community needs to do so much more right now to stop Ebola in its tracks, before it really gets right out of control,' she said. 'It has been so inspiring and it has really kept me going in the past few days to know there’s growing public support for action to help people affected by Ebola in West Africa.' 'Most importantly to me, I’m sending a message to my fellow medical professionals who are thinking about heading over to treat the sick and work at bringing Ebola under control: Please, please do it'. Ms Kovack decked out in medical gear during her stint in the West African nation . Dr Jeannette Young broke the news at a press conference on Thursday afternoon . Ms Kovack said she had been moved by the outpouring of support for her. While Ms Kovack was in hospital her friend Jennifer King told ABC's Lateline program the volunteer nurse was 'popular' and 'well-known' in the Cairns medical community. 'She wants to help people, she's incredibly compassionate and she's selfless like not many people on earth,' Ms King said. 'A bunch of the nurses [at Cairns Hospital] have gone down to Accident and Emergency [department] to offer to nurse Sue Ellen, which is really brave. 'They're upset and they want to help.' Ms Kovack's humanitarian efforts were slammed by outspoken Federal MP Bob Katter. The member for Kennedy - whose electorate takes in the southern area of Cairns and the town's airport - said her volunteering pursuits had put the nation at risk. Mr Katter said it was 'unbelievable and incomprehensive' how a person could get into Australia from an Ebola-infected country. 'There cannot be any compromise with this,' Mr Katter said. 'If you want to go to one of these countries, however laudable your motivation, I am sorry but when you return to Australia, you must be quarantined for three weeks - not home quarantined.' Mr Katter said Australian aid workers travelling to west Africa, including Ms Kovack, were putting Australia at risk. 'We love these people, and we honour these Australians for being self-sacrificing, but compared to the risk they create for our country, it is not remotely comparable. 'One person's moral and humanitarian ambitions are being carried out at a very grave cost to Australia,' he said. But Queensland's chief medical officer Dr Jeannette Young last week praised Ms Kovack's efforts and said she had acted appropriately when raising the alarm to health authorities. 'I think she's an amazing lady to go to Africa and provide that service,' Dr Young said. 'She has done everything appropriately.' Ms Kovack remained in isolation after she returned home, as is the protocol for medical workers who have treated Ebola patients overseas. Dr Young said Ms Kovack had been testing herself in the 'isolation' of her own home and had not been into the Cairns community since she returned home last week. '(On Thursday) morning she rang up as part of [national health] protocol because she developed a low-grade fever of 37.6 degrees Celsius. 'But we felt it important that she come into Cairns Hospital for Ebola virus disease.' Ms Kovack is originally from Toronto, Canada but is living in Cairns, Queensland . Cairns Hospital where the 57-year-old is under observation and quarantined . A Federal Department of Health spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia any health care worker who comes back from an affected country needs to monitor their health - including taking their temperature twice a day - and cannot return to work for 21 days. Health Minister Peter Dutton moved to reassure the public that talking to people arriving from Ebola-hit countries is still the best method of screening for the deadly disease. He said doctors still backed the process to identify and contact people arriving into the country who may have been exposed to the disease. 'I think that's the more effective screening process at the moment, but these things evolve,' he told the ABC. Mr Dutton said introducing a screening in arrivals halls could be problematic. 'It provides a sort of air of complacency if you like,' he told the ABC. 'So people come through, they feel unwell a couple of days later and they think ""No, no, I've just been through that screening process and I wasn't picked up, I'm ok"".' Mr Dutton reiterated the World Health Organisation had not asked Australia for on-the-ground health workers in the stricken African countries. But he said that advice may change over time. Australia will send help if a case presents in the region, for example in PNG, the minister said. 'We would be expected within our region to rapidly respond, and we have the capacity to do that with a team out of Darwin ... and resources within Canberra,' Mr Dutton said. Before she left for Sierra Leone, Ms Kovack spoke to media about her journey, and was actively keeping her friends and family up to date on Facebook. 'I'm a little bit nervous, a little bit anxious but healthily anxious I think,' she told local newspaper The Cairns Post. In an interview with the ABC last month, she said it was her responsibility to help those in need. 'I care about humanity and if I have what people need, I would like to use these skills. 'Why me? Well, if not me then who?' Ms Kovack said. Ms Kovack recently shared happy snaps of her in Sierra Leone, dressed in quarantine uniforms and being sprayed by decontamination hoses. Ms Kovack is expected to find out on Friday morning whether or not she has the deadly virus . On September 23, she wrote: 'Big day... Have taken our first bloods from our first ebola survivor at the (International Federation of the Red Cross) treatment centre. It was not the first time Ms Kovack had travelled overseas to help those in need. She had previously worked with the Red Cross in war-torn South Sudan and had volunteered in Sierra Leone in 2002. The Ebola virus has infected an estimated 7,200 people, according to the World Health Organisation. More than 3300 have died. There have been no recorded cases in Australia. Last month, a Gold Coast man was placed in isolation after he was feared to be suffering the deadly illness. He was quickly cleared of the condition.","Red Cross nurse Sue Ellen Kovack tested negative for Ebola virus .

"The air we breathe is laced with cancer-causing substances and is being officially classified as carcinogenic to humans, the World Health Organisation has said. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) said that in 2010, 223,000 deaths from lung cancer worldwide resulted from air pollution. The agency also said that there is convincing evidence it increases the risk of bladder cancer. Motorists travel through haze in Pekanbaru, Indonesia. Air pollution has been named as the main cause of lung cancer by the World Health Organisation . It listed the main sources of outdoor air pollution as transport, power generation, industrial and agricultural emissions, and heating and cooking in residential buildings. Some air pollutants also have natural sources, it added. Air pollution is already known to increase risks for a wide range of diseases, such as respiratory and heart diseases. Depending on the level of exposure in different parts of the world, the risk was found to be similar to that of breathing in second-hand tobacco smoke, Kurt Straif, head of the agency's section that ranks carcinogens, told reporters in Geneva. In a statement, deputy head of the WHO cancer agency, Dana Loomis, said: 'Our task was to evaluate the air everyone breathes rather than focus on specific air pollutants. 'The results from the reviewed studies point in the same direction: the risk of developing lung cancer is significantly increased in people exposed to air pollution.' Air pollution, mostly caused by . transport, power generation, industrial or agricultural emissions and . residential heating and cooking, is already known to raise risks for a . wide range of illnesses including respiratory and heart diseases. Research suggests that exposure levels . have risen significantly in some parts of the world, particularly . countries with large populations going through rapid industrialisation, . such as China. Air pollution has also been linked to bladder cancer by the World Health Organisation . IARC reviewed thousands of studies on air pollution tracking populations over decades and other research such as those in which mice exposed to polluted air experienced increased numbers of lung tumours. In a statement released after reviewing the literature, the Lyon-based agency said both air pollution and particulate matter - a major component of it - would now be classified among its Group 1 human carcinogens. That ranks them alongside more than 100 other known cancer-causing substances in IARC's Group 1, including asbestos, plutonium, silica dust, ultraviolet radiation and tobacco smoke. Dr. Christopher Wild, director of IARC, told a news briefing in Geneva that the work's aim is to be as comprehensive as possible. He said: 'Often we're looking at two, three or four decades once an exposure is introduced before there is sufficient impact on the burden of cancer in the population to be able to study this type of question.'","In 2010, air pollution caused the deaths of 223,000 lung cancer patients, according to the World Health Organisation .

"Samantha Cherry's baby son was handed a bottle of bleach by a complete stranger in a fast food restaurant in 2011 . Jonjo Freed's grandmother looked away from his pram for just a second or two as she waited for her daughter to buy ice cream in their local McDonald's. But it's an act that still haunts her, as in those few seconds her precious 11-month-old grandson had been handed a baby bottle filled with bleach by a complete stranger. After drinking from the bottle Jonjo choked and vomited violently but survived thanks to the swift reactions of grandmother Mandy Cherry and his mother Samantha Cherry. Elaine Joyner, 53, from Deptford in south-east London, has since been found to have committed the act and detained in a mental health hospital. As well as attempting to poison Jonjo she has committed several other acts of violence against young children. Recently the order protecting Jonjo's identity has been lifted and today Mandy and Samantha appeared on This Morning to talk about the ordeal, and explain that they don't feel any anger towards the boy's attacker, but ask why she was allowed to remain free when she was obviously a risk to the public. Mandy described how a quick family lunch to McDonald's on Eltham High Street, September 13, 2011, almost turned to tragedy: 'It was just a normal everyday situation. Nothing out of the ordinary at all. Jonjo was in the aisle in a big pram because he was quite young. 'My one mistake was glancing out the window, or maybe I drank my coffee and took my eye off him. It's something that I'll regret forever. 'I heard him coughing and choking so immediately my eyes were back on him. I thought he was choking on a chip. Jonjo as a baby at home with mother Samantha and her fiance Ashley Freed . 'But he was white and he was frothing and he was scared. He was frothing and retching as I picked him up and a bottle dropped on to the floor - the type he drinks out of all of the time. 'It was an orange liquid, wheras he normally drinks milk or water. 'When Sam retruned she said ""What have you done?"", so I said ""What have YOU done? What have you given him in this bottle?"".' Samantha added: 'I knew straight away that it wasn't his bottle. I took the lid off but I didn't need to taste it I could smell it. 'Mum screamed ""Has anybody seen somebody give this baby a bottle?"".' Mandy added: 'It was only at that point that we realised something had taken place. 'You don't think anyone is going to poison a child. It's the last thing you actually think of.' Samantha Cherry (l) and her mother Mandy Cherry (r) on the sofa with Jonjo, who is now three years old . Two customers - who became vital . witnesses in the case against Elaine Joyner - revealed that they had . seen a woman drop a bottle into the pram. CCTV later confirmed that it . took just three to five seconds for the dangerous bottle to be within the baby's grasp. Jonjo was taken into hospital and survived without any serious injury. The . liquid in the bottle was tested and found to be acid but not pure bleach, . which could have burnt his trachea, and meant long-term damage . or even death. Today Jonjo, now three years old, is perfectly well and appeared unfazed by the incident as he joined his . mother and grandmother on the sofa at the end of the interview. His attacker, who has a history of wanting to harm children, remains indefinitely in a mental health hospital. When asked about her Jonjo's mother Samantha told Philip Schofield: 'She needed help . and she needed to be put away somewhere safe where she couldn't harm . anybody else.' Mandy added: 'I . don't feel anger towards her, because if it's a mental issue you can't . help that anymore than you can help having anything, but she should have . been dealt with before she got to danger point.'

"Pret a Manger has announced that it is selling 9,000 bowls of porridge a day . It sells a lot of sushi wraps, coconut water, kale crisps, wild crayfish with rocket sandwiches and double berry muffins. But nothing is more popular at Pret a Manger, the healthy fast food chain, than something which is a lot simpler and more traditional. Its bestselling product last year was just a bowl of porridge, the company said yesterday. Pret a . Manger said its £2.35 ‘porridge pots’ were its bestselling item last . year, selling more than 3.2million pots in the UK, equal to around 8,800 . every day. With . just 243 calories in each 300g pot - compared to 616 calories in its . All-Day Breakfast Roll - its porridge is also one of its more slimming . options for breakfast. Pret has only been selling porridge since 2010, and its popularity has surged recently. Sales . rose by ten per cent last year, compared to 2012, even managing to beat . the previous bestseller - bananas - into second place in the 2013 . league table of Pret’s most popular foods. Such is its enthusiasm for porridge that it has specially trained ‘porridge chefs’ to make its breakfast bestseller. It . is stirred ‘gently but continuously’ until it is cooked to avoid lumps, . and must be removed immediately from the heat when it is ready to stop . it from becoming too gloopy. The . revelation comes after porridge has seen a huge surge in popularity as a . healthy alternative to sugary and expensive breakfast cereals. It is said to be the regular breakfast choice of celebrities and politicians from the Prime Minister, David Cameron, to Madonna, Nicole Kidman and Bill Gates. After the London bombings in 2005, the former Prime Minister, Tony Blair, is said to have turned down a three-course lunch at the Gleneagles Hotel in favour of a bowl of porridge served with cream and Drambuie-laced raspberries. Traditionally, the Scottish would have eaten porridge in its purest form, made with hot water with a pinch of salt for taste. Sales in Pret a Manger jumped by 15 percent last year to £510 million . Today porridge is often just a useful vehicle for a large pool of maple syrup, a mountain of brown sugar or a generous portion of cream. Pret offers two free toppings for their customer’s porridge pots - a berry compote or honey. Honey is the most popular option, it said yesterday. A recent report, by the retail analysts Mintel, found the value of porridge sales have nearly doubled over the last six years to nearly £250million a year. Medical research has shown that oats are important for the diet because they help to reduce the level of blood cholesterol, which is associated with clogged arteries. A warming bowl in the morning is also a relatively cheap and good source of slow release carbohydrates which helps people to feel full and maintain energy levels. It is possible to buy a 1kg pack of porridge oats for as little as 75p while a 1kg box of Kelloggs Cornflakes costs £3.39. Overall, Pret said it sells more cold-pressed vegetable juices, such as carrot juice, than Super Club sandwiches. The ‘classic’ is made from chicken, bacon, tomatoes, salad and mayonnaise. Its financial results, published yesterday, show annual sales jumped by 15 per cent last year to £510million in the year ending on 2 January. In 2013, it opened another 40 new shops, including 26 in the UK. The other 14 were in America, Hong Kong and France, raising its total number of shops worldwide to 352. Pret was opened in 1986 by two former surveyors, Julian Metcalfe and Sinclair Beecham, who said they were fed up with not being able to find a decent sandwich at lunchtime. A few years ago, it was criticised by the former employment minister, Chris Grayling, after one branch in London appeared to be staffed entirely by foreigners. At the time, he said: It is certainly a situation that I find unacceptable. Of course, this country has benefitted from people coming in from other countries to work. ‘But I want to see more young people in positions in this country and I want...to see them getting jobs that become vacant, rather than people coming into the UK.’ Yesterday Pret said it created 600 new jobs worldwide last year, and has doubled the size of its UK school leavers programme to 18 people.","Pret a Manger sold 3.2 million pots of porridge during 2013 .

"The famously conservative Joe Scarborough shockingly said on Monday that the shootings in Newtown, Connecticut have forced him to rethink his ‘long-held’ believes about the right to bear arms. The former Republican congressman said he spoke ‘with a heavy heart and no easy answers,’ but ‘the ideologies of my past career were no longer relevant for the future that I demand for my children.’ The result of his ten-minute monologue was one demanding a rapid and utter change in gun control laws, as it is now about public safety and the safety of America’s citizens. Scroll down for video . Things must change: Speaking Monday on 'Morning Joe,' Joe Scarborough said that the past laws are no longer good enough to protect America's citizens . Conservative: A Republican, Scarborough said that Friday's elementary school shooting 'changed everything' in terms of gun control . Scarborough gave his powerful speech on Monday’s episode of ‘Morning Joe,’ telling the audience that Friday’s shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in the once-idyllic New England town ‘changed everything.’ ‘Let this be our true landmark. Politicians can no longer be allowed to defend the status quo. 'They must instead be forced to defend our children,’ he said, adding that several factors of this particular shooting resonated deeply with him – including that one of his sons has Asperger’s Syndrome, and that his children are about the age of many of Sandy’s victims. ‘Friday changed everything. It must change everything,’ Scarborough said, noting the shootings in Aurora, Virginia Tech, and Portland, Oregon. After each prior shooting, Scarborough said, he took a libertarian’s approach to ‘Hollywood’s First Amendment rights and gun collectors’ Second Amendment rights.’ But, he continued, that had to change. ‘I say good luck to the gun lobbyists, good luck to the Hollywood lawyer who tries to hide behind twisted readings of our Bill of Rights. Shifting: Sen. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia, left, and Sen. Mark Warner, D-Virginia, right, both have earned top marks from the NRA but said they would be open to more regulation . Change of heart: House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said she would support legislation banning assault weapons after previously throwing cold water on the idea . ‘The battle we now must fight and the battle we have to win is for the safety of your children and mine.’ Scarborough has joined an increasing chorus of previously pro-gun pundits who have since experienced a paradigm shift in the wake of Sandy Hook. 'Friday changed everything. It must change everything.' Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Virginia Senator Mark Warner, both Democrats who have earned top marks from the powerful National Rifle Association, said they would now be open to more regulation of military-style rifles like the one used to kill 20 young children and six adults on Friday. And House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said she would support legislation banning assault weapons after previously throwing cold water on the idea. 'The voices of reason cannot be silent,' she said on the House floor late on Monday. 'Through administrative and legislative action, we must limit the proliferation of weapons and ammunition that have no other purpose than to kill citizens.' U.S. lawmakers have not approved a major new federal gun law since 1994, and a ban on certain semi-automatic rifles known as assault weapons expired in 2004. Mourning: A woman carries a teddy bear to a makeshift memorial in Newtown, Connecticut on Monday after 20 children were murdered last Friday . All in white: The faces of some of the victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting are displayed on roses at a makeshift memorial . Respects: Visitors light candles at a memorial to shooting victims, Monday, December 17, in Newtown . Senator Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat who authored the previous ban, pledged to introduce legislation early next year to ban the weapons. Previous attempts at toughening U.S. gun laws have failed amid opposition from the NRA and other gun-lobby groups - even after mass shootings across the country. But the shift by moderate Democrats showed that the weapons lobby could face a tougher fight this time to ward off calls for more regulation. Brave new world: A Connecticut state trooper mans a checkpoint on the road leading towards Sandy Hook Elementary School Monday night . However, with Congress and President Obama busy trying to resolve the 'fiscal cliff' of tax and spending deadlines, even liberal Democrats acknowledge that any review of gun laws would not take place until 2013. A hunter and member of the National Rifle Association, Manchin said the availability of such high-powered weapons does not make sense, and that he knew of no hunter who went out with assault rifles or clips with 30 rounds of ammunition. 'This awful massacre of our youngest children has changed us, and everything should be on the table,' said Manchin, who once ran a campaign ad in which he shot environmental legislation with a rifle.

"Engineers from McLaren and Ferrari are used to going head-to-head on the Formula One race track in order to give drivers the best chance of taking poll position. But the two racing thoroughbreds are now competing in bobsleigh and skeleton events at the Winter Olympics too as they have both built cutting-edge equipment for athletes representing their home countries – Great Britain and Italy. McLaren Applied Technologies applied the same technologies used in the F1 world to improve the aerodynamic efficiency and structural integrity of the sleighs, which will give the British team a competitive edge at the Games. Aerodynamic: McLaren Applied Technologies applied the same technologies used in the F1 world to improve the aerodynamic efficiency and structural integrity of the sleighs, which will give the British team a competitive edge at the Games. Here, Lamin Deen pilots a sled in a practice run . The Team GB bobsleigh consists of a main hull, a frame, a front and rear axle and two sets of runners. The hull, also known as a cowling, is constructed of fibreglass and made of two separate sections. The hull is mounted on four runners that each must be made of a single solid piece of steel. No plating or coating is allowed and it is not permitted to warm up runners or use any substance that improves sliding. At the start of the race, the temperature difference between the runners and the reference runner, which is exposed to the open air for one hour before the start of the competition, must be no greater than plus or minus four degrees Celsius. A bob may have a cowled front end but must be open at the rear. Push bars protrude from the hull at the start of a race. Those for the second and third man in the four man event must be retractable. Each bobsleigh has a brake that can only be applied at the finish. Braking during the race means automatic disqualification. Dr Caroline Hargrove, Director of Performance at McLaren Applied Technologies, which is based in Woking, Surrey, told MailOnline that the building of the sleds is about making sure they are designed and made as well as possible to achieve little gains rather than a revolutionary new design. This is because the rules governing which materials are used and the components of the sled are strictly controlled by the Winter Olympics body and any incremental improvements are top secret. ‘In essence we have made both sleds work better and have made them more adaptable - rather than necessarily having radically altered the shape or design of particular components,’ Dr Hargrove said. The company has been involved in the . design of the equipment from the Canadian Olympics and has gathered vast . amounts of data as well as helping the athletes have input into the . design so they can use it easily. The Team GB bobsleigh consists of a main hull, a frame, a front and rear axle and two sets of runners. It has to be made to suit strict rules and key principles to make a good sled (pictured) are applied by engineers . The pressure is on for the sleds to perform well as this year’s British team contains FIBT Skeleton World Cup leader Lizzy Yarnold, who topped the standings in both runs of the Women's Skeleton heats yesterday. Unlike in Formula One, skeleton sleds and bobsleighs need to be heavy so that they gain speed downhill, but at the same time they must also be light enough for athletes to manoeuvre. There is a sweet spot that leads to optimal performance that also complies with strict regulations. ‘Ferrari have built the bobsleigh for the . Italian team so, as you expect, this has given the team at McLaren an . added incentive to produce the goods for Team GB,’ a spokesman for the . company said. Fanboys: Teams of engineers used a wind tunnel (pictured) and computational fluid dynamics tools to reduce the drag of sleds and hone their aerodynamic bodies, which are made largely of carbon fibre and steel . Lizzy Yarnold (pictured) was the fastest in the field during the heats of the Women's Skeleton on day six of the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics. McLaren said that Team GB athletes are the only ones to use a sled that is completely tailor made for them. Before, they used one size of sled for men and women . To engineer the perfect sleds, experts at McLaren first collected lots of data by fitting test sleds with a range of sensors to understand their strengths and weaknesses - essentially looking at how to make them go faster. Engineers analysed handling data, as handling directly influences speed and looked at unwanted vibrations that hamper good contact between the ice and the sled. They then worked to tweak the designs of the bobsleighs and skeleton bob to tailor them to athletes and enhance their performance. This process included an evaluation of all aspects of design - ranging from materials to aerodynamics - using simulators to identify changes that could make all the difference when it comes to setting a fast time. Data capture: McLaren has been involved in the design of the sleds (pictured) since the Canadian Olympics and has gathered vast amounts of data as well as helping the athletes have input into the designs . Data: McLaren fitted test sleds with a range of sensors, enabling engineers to understand how to make them go faster. Design: The company enhanced the standard design of the sleds to make performance improvements tailored to each athlete. They looked at the materials used, aerodynamics and handling capabilities using computational fluid dynamics and a massive wind tunnel. Set-up: Engineers built adaptability into the designs for the sleds, enabling them to be configured specifically to suit athletes and tracks, rather than relying on a standardised design. Manufacturing: the sleds are hand built and the company has used suppliers it also uses to build its F1 cars. It managed the assembly of sled components with attention to detail not seen before by Team GB. Training: McLaren worked with athletes and coaches to help them learn how to maintain the sleds and understand how to make the best of technological improvements. The company has sent two engineers to the games to iron out any technical glitches. Dr Hargrove said: ‘For the bobsleigh, we wanted to optimise the speed and manoeuvrability of the sled so that athletes can get a better line and therefore go faster. ‘To do this we made computer models and fed in lots of data. We then ran cycles, in the same way that we do for Formula One, to find tiny improvements – and when we did, created parts to test.’ Teams of engineers used a wind tunnel and computational fluid dynamics tools to reduce the drag of sleds and hone their aerodynamic bodies, which are made largely of carbon fibre and steel. The Formula One company managed the manufacturing and assembly of sled components, helping to bring F1 techniques and attention to detail to the sports, which have in the past used old equipment. ‘In the skeleton, we are the only country with a completely adjustable approach. Before there was just one size of sled for men and women, which was not ideal,’ Dr Hargrove said. ‘Every component of the GB sled is adjustable compared to other countries we have real attention to detail. The quality of manufacturing is also really important.’ Each sled is hand built in comparison to the Team GB’s previous sleds, which McLaren described as 'pretty poor’. Dr Hargrove said: ‘The team used to buy second hand sleds and by the time they were modified by different people – some good and some poor – over time, they were less effective. If we only made the sled well, it would have already been much better.’ Cool runnings: McLaren thinks that Team GB is 'definitely' capable of bagging a gold medal in Skeleton and that they have 'a good chance' in bobsleigh. The Sochi run is illustrated, which usually has three uphill sections to slow the sleds down . Going for gold: To engineer the perfect sleds, McLaren first collected lots of data by fitting test sleds with a range of sensors to understand their strengths and weaknesses - essentially looking at how to make them go faster at the Winter Olympics. Lizzy Yarnold is pictured on a run during the Women's Skeleton heats . McLaren managed the manufacturing and assembly of sled components at its factory (pictured) helping to bring F1 techniques and attention to detail to bobsleigh and skeleton, where old equipment has been used in competitions in the past . ‘The design is very strictly governed by the rules and all teams use the same components. In that way it’s similar to Formula One as the FIA and F1 governing body dictate closely what we can do and we try to make incremental gains,’ she added. One of the key ways to make a sled quicker is to improve the way that it takes corners and it is where fractions of seconds can be won and lost. McLaren has worked with athletes in training to figure out how to maximise the impact of technological improvements made to the sleds. Dr Hargrove said: ‘We spend a lot of time at the beginning of the cycles getting athlete feedback and with the alteration of any important detail. Some tweaks might mean a slight change in control, but once athletes learn to adapt they will go faster and we can show them this using a simulator.’ Factory fresh: McLaren has worked with athletes in training to figure out how to maximise the impact of technological improvements made to the sleds at its Surrey-based factory (pictured) Built to last: Each sled (pictured) is hand built in comparison to the Team GB's previous sleds, which McLaren described as 'pretty poor'. Here, Britain's two-man bobsleigh pilot Lamin Deen (front), uses a new sled during a training session at the Games . The company uses simulations so that athletes can train in virtual environments when they are not anywhere near an icy run – which is quite often in the UK. Videos of tracks can be used to gather data and athletes are involved at different stages of changes to their sled’s performance. Dr Hargrove said the competition is a little like Formula One on ice, ‘but the outcome is hugely dependent on the athletes – even more so than in Formula One.  In the Olympics, the athletes are at the centre of it all as we hope we’ve helped them as much as we can.’ She thinks the Team GB is ‘definitely’ capable of bagging a gold medal in Skeleton and that the athletes have ‘a good chance’ in bobsleigh. The company uses simulations so that athletes can train in virtual environments before taking to a real ice run.

"Tragic: Hsueh Jun-Chen burned himself to death using gasoline after being told to stop playing computer games by his father in western Taiwan . A video game addict burned himself to death after being 'tipped over the edge' when his father told him to stop playing and get more sleep. Online games fan Hsueh Jun-Chen, 22, had been in his room at his family home in the town of Fenyuan in western Taiwan when father Liu, 48, knocked on his door and told him to go to sleep. The two then exchanged heated words and the father told his son he was fed up with his gaming and wanted him to stop. But the next day he realised Hsueh was missing and when he went outside to look for him, he found the boy's charred remains 300 metres away - with empty bottles of petrol lying nearby. Devastated Liu said: 'I had simply said that he should sleep rather than play because university was starting again after the holidays. 'He said he would and that's the last time I saw him alive. 'When I saw that he wasn't in his room the next day, I went into the garage to see if he had gone out on his motorbike. 'The bike was still there but I noticed that two cans of petrol were missing. 'That made me feel worried and I began to fear the worst. 'I could never have thought he would do something as extreme as this though.'

"Al Qaeda inspired terrorists in Iraq are 'just a few hours flying time' from striking Britain 'and want to attack us', Home Secretary Theresa May said tonight. Mrs May said Islamist fighters had carved out a 'safe haven' in the Middle East - with 'advanced technology and weapons' capable of threatening the UK. She said the terror threat was now 'on the doorstep of Europe' and was the most serious since 9/11. Mrs May also revealed that some women are among the 400 radicals that have left the UK to fight in Syria. Home Secretary Theresa May tonight launched an impassioned defence of the security services and warned the threat faced by Britain was serious . The Home Secretary's dramatic warning is reminiscent of Tony Blair's infamous claim that Saddam Hussein was just 45 minutes away from hitting Britain in the run up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. But the Home Secretary, speaking at the Lord Mayor's annual security and defence Lecture at London's Mansion House, said the terror threats against Britain are 'considerable'. She also reiterated her demand for fresh powers to monitor people's internet like emails and skype calls to keep tabs on terrorists. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has blocked any further extension of the Government's powers to monitor people's communications. But Mrs May said: 'We need to make changes to the law to maintain the capabilities we need.' 'This is quite simply a question of life and death, a matter of national security. We must keep on making the case until we get the changes we need.' Mrs May revealed she was now signing off spying warrants every week for the police and security services to monitor British based terrorists planning to travel to fight in the Middle East. She said around '400 UK linked individuals' have gone to fight in Syria include 'many young men but also some women'. But she said the security services were working with their hands tied behind their back because they did not have the power to monitor the internet properly. She said the web was becoming 'a safe haven for terrorism and criminality'. Mrs May said the 'danger is already upon us'. The Home Secretary said: 'We no longer have capabilities upon which we have always relied. 'Let me give one example. Over a six-month period the National Crime Agency alone estimates that it has had to drop at least twenty cases as a result of missing communications data. 'Thirteen of these were threat-to-life cases in which a child was assessed to be at risk of imminent harm.' She added: 'The real problem is not that we have built an over-mighty state but that the state is finding it harder to fulfil its most basic duty, which is to protect the public. ISIS fighters in Iraq and Syria are no longer just a threat to towns and cities in the Middle East - they also plan to attack Britain, according to the Home Secretary . ISIS has carved out an safe haven to attack Britain from 'just a few hours' away, Theresa May warned tonight . Mrs May said the Government had been criticised for 'overstating the threats we face'. But she said: 'We need to remember some facts. Between September 2001 and the end of 2013, more than 2,500 people were arrested for terrorist offences in this country. 'Almost 400 people have been convicted for terrorism-related offences. We have disrupted more than one major attack in this country each year since 2005 and many more overseas. Mrs May's warning is reminiscent of the now-discredited claim that Saddam Hussein could hit Britain in  45 minutes . She added: 'The terrorist threats to this country and our interests are changing faster than at any time since 9/11. 'We continue to face possible attacks by al Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan. 'But we face further threats from Syria and now from Iraq where al Qaeda, ISIL and others have created a safe haven with substantial resources including advanced technology and weapons. 'They are on the doorstep of Europe, just a few hours flying time from London, and they want to attack us – not just in Syria or Iraq but here in Britain. Mrs May revealed that 'many hundreds of people from our country have travelled to Syria to fight against the Assad regime'. She said: 'They have ended up fighting for terrorist groups, often against other parts of the opposition rather than against the Syrian government. 'Some of them will present a real danger to us when they return to Britain. The investigation of these people will require all of our sensitive capabilities and the skills and resources of the agencies and police. 'It will involve the further use of the powers I have through the Royal Prerogative to remove people’s passports to stop them travelling – and in a smaller number of cases, I am prepared to use my powers to deprive people with dual citizenship of their British nationality.'","Home Secretary warns ISIS fighters in Iraq 'want to attack us here in Britain'

"Controversial actor Gerard Depardieu is used to wading through seas of paparazzi in a hail of camera flash... and that's just in his private life. And today the French film star put all that practice to good use as he assumed the role of Dominique Strauss-Kahn in a movie about the sex scandal that engulfed the former IMF chief in 2011. The movie, which is being filmed in New York, is understood to paint an unsympathetic picture of DSK, who was cleared of raping a French maid while staying at the Sofitel Hotel in the city. In an interview with Swiss Television RTS last year, Depardieu revealed he agreed to play the part because he found his fellow countryman 'arrogant and smug', adding: 'He is very French. I will do it, because I don't like him.' Spitting image: Gerard Depardieu, left, recreates the media storm surrounding the 2011 sexual assault trial of disgraced former International Monetary Fund head Dominick Strauss-Kahn, right . Photo hounds: The re-enactment featured a throng of photographers snapping images as the fictional DSK, his wife and daughter Camille Strauss-Kahn . Smoke break: Depardieu and Bissett on the set of the DSK movie shooting in New York City . Depardieu will be joined on screen by  Nip/Truck actress Jacqueline Bisset, who will play DSK's ex-wife, the French TV reporter Anne Sinclair. And yesterday, the actors got caught . in controlled chaos as they re-enacted the media storm surrounding the . sexual assault trial, that ultimately collapsed in August 2011. The scene depicted the media frenzy . surrounding the case that was sparked when an immigrant hotel maid . accused the then-IMF chief of sexual assault after she entered his suite . to clean it.

Announcing his latest venture last year, Ferrara said it would be set in New York, Paris and Washington, adding: '[It will be set] in all spots of power in fact: it’s a film about rich and powerful people.' Depardieu himself is no stranger to the courts. Earlier this month, the Green Card actor missed a hearing in Paris over an alleged drunken scooter incident. The 64-year-old actor, who also . failed to attend court for the last hearing in January, was more than . three times over the drink-drive limit when he came off his moped near . the Champs-Elysees in Paris last November. He had been due to attend a . 'correctional tribunal' in Paris to face a charge of drink-driving, but . he did not turn up because he was filming his new role as . Dominique Strauss-Kahn in New York.

"The recommended 21-day quarantine period for the Ebola virus is not long enough to contain the spread of the disease, a new study has warned. The World Health Organisation (WHO) advises the incubation period for the virus is between two and 21 days. It is thought that if someone who has been in contact with an Ebola victim but does not develop symptoms after that point, has not been infected. But a study by scientists at Drexel University in Philadelphia has found there is a 12 per cent chance the deadly virus could lay dormant in a person's body for longer than the three-week period. A Nigerian health official uses a thermometer to check for Ebola on a worker at the arrivals hall of Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Lagos . However a study warned today there is a 12 per cent chance the deadly virus could lay dormant in a person's body for longer than the three-week incubation period . A medical worker sprays people being discharged from the Island Clinic Ebola treatment centre in Monrovia, Liberia. The findings of the new study mean a significant proportion of the population in West Africa could be developing the disease outside of the key incubation period . It means a significant proportion of the population in West Africa could be developing the disease outside of the key incubation period. Biologist professor Charles Hass said when calculating the isolation period on the basis of past outbreaks, there is always a 'standard deviation for results' - a percentage by which they may vary - which has yet to be taken into account during this outbreak. Professor Hass, who has vast experience of analysing the risk of transmitting biological pathogens, said 'reconsideration is in order' as 21 days may not be sufficient to protect public health. He said: 'Twenty one days has been regarded as the appropriate quarantine period for holding individuals potentially exposed to Ebola Virus to reduce risk of contagion, but there does not appear to be a systemic discussion of the basis for this period.' Data gathered by the WHO from earlier outbreaks in Zaire and Uganda reported an incubation period of between two and 21 days for the virus, meaning if the individual has not presented with symptoms after three weeks they are unlikely to be infected or contagious. Professor Haas said he believes a broader look at risk factors should be considered as with any research of this nature there is a standard deviation in results. In the case of Ebola's incubation period the range of results generated from Zaire and Uganda varied little, and this may have contributed to the WHO's certainty. Ebola has killed more than 4,500 people in West Africa and wreaked havoc on the region. Biologist Charles Hass says the recommended 21-day quarantine period for the Ebola virus 'must be reconsidered' Isabelle Nuttall, of the World Health Organization (WHO) director of global capacities, alert and response global capacities  listens to a question during a press conference on the Ebola epidemic outbreak on October 16, 2014 at the United Nations offices in Geneva.  Ebola's escalating spread constitutes the worst global health emergency in years, world leaders warned, vowing to dramatically step up the response to the virus that has already killed nearly 4,500 people. AFP PHOTO / FABRICE COFFRINIFABRICE COFFRINI/AFP/Getty Images . But looking more broadly at data from other Ebola outbreaks in Congo in 1995 and West Africa recently suggests there could be up to a 12 per cent chance that someone could be infected even after the 21-day quarantine. Professor Haas, whose research is published in PLOS Currents, said: 'While the 21-day quarantine value, currently used, may have arisen from reasonable interpretation of early outbreak data, this work suggests reconsideration is in order and 21 days might not be sufficiently protective of public health.' He said these quarantine periods must be determined by looking at the cost of enforcing the quarantine against the that of releasing exposed individuals. Looking at the potential trade off between costs and benefits as the quarantine time is extended should guide public health officials in determining the appropriate action. But, with more contagious and potentially deadly diseases the cost of making a mistake on the short side when determining a quarantine is extremely high. Professor Haas, added: 'Clearly for pathogens that have a high degree of transmissibility and a high degree of severity, the quarantine time should be greater than for agents with lower transmissibility and severity. 'The purpose of this paper is not to estimate where the balancing point should be, but to suggest a method for determining the balancing point.'","The World Health Organisation advises the incubation period for the Ebola virus is two to 21 days .

Agony: Schaub rolls around on the ground at the Denver stadium after taking a blow to the head . After Schaub was brought down by Mays, a second roughing-the-passer penalty was given against the Broncos, causing the Texans to make a field goal and take a 24-11 lead. Schaub skipped one play in the third quarter but then returned to the field to make his final touchdown, drawing praise from his teammates and opponents alike. Despite his injury, it was still a good game from Schaub, who threw four touchdowns against the Broncos defense leading to a 31-25 victory for his team. Texans coach Gary Kubiak said: 'We did what we had to do to win, convinced them that we had to make some big plays and they did.'

"Manchester is the laziest place in Britain with nearly half of residents exercising less than once a month, according to a new study. The country's increasingly sedentary lifestyle means that by 2030 the average person will use just a quarter more energy in a day than if they had stayed in bed. And Mancunians are in the worst state of all, with 40 per cent doing less than half an hour of exercise a month - classing them as 'inactive'. Lazy: The results were worst in Manchester, Sandwell, the West Midlands, Salford and Bradford (pictured) Nearby Salford and Sandwell in the . West Midlands were nearly as bad, with non-exercisers also making up . more than a third of the population in places such as Bradford, Slough . and Sunderland. By contrast, Wokingham in Berkshire is the most active area, as 82 per cent of residents exercise at leasts once in every month. Well-heeled . areas of London and the Home Counties such as Windsor, Kensington and . Oxfordshire also did well in the figures compiled by public health . experts Ukactive. The ‘pandemic’ of inactivity in poor areas of England is leading to 17 per cent of premature deaths, the report said. The . health group found that in the most inactive areas, there is an average . of 342 premature deaths per 100,000 people per year, compared with 242 . in those where people exercise the most. Fit: Even in the fittest areas of Britain - . the London borough of Richmond upon Thames (pictured) and Wokingham in Berkshire - . one in five people did not manage 30 minutes of exercise . Inactivity costs the economy in each . local authority £18 million per 100,000 people every year on average, . the study found. Cutting physical inactivity by just 1per cent a year . over a five-year period would save the UK economy just under £1.2 . billion, it said. Researchers . found that the most inactive local authorities have, on average, a . third fewer leisure facilities than the least inactive areas. But . they said there is no link between levels of exercise and the amount of . green space in each region. This contrasts with a report published . yesterday from the the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), . which found a lack of green space meant people were more likely to . suffer ill health and walk less. Research carried out by Ukactive has shown sedentary lifestyles mean that by 2030 the average person will use just a quarter more energy in a day than if they had stayed in bed . David Stalker, chief executive officer of Ukactive, said inactivity was ‘a distinct risk to public health’. Fred Turok, chairman of Ukactive, said: ‘It’s no longer acceptable that physical inactivity remains the forgotten cause of death in the UK. 'More deprived areas are faring worse in a physical inactivity pandemic - with no national strategy to improve our fitness levels, from before we take our first steps to our last.’ Lord Sebastian Coe, who is backing the report, said: ‘Physical inactivity currently accounts for nearly one fifth of premature deaths in the UK. 'With projections showing that inactivity levels are due to increase by a further 15% by 2030, there is no doubt that the issue requires immediate national attention and urgent action.’","'Pandemic' of inactivity in poor areas is leading to premature deaths .

"Physicists have succeeded in chilling molecules to the coldest temperature ever reported. The experiment lowered the temperature of selected molecules to 2.5 thousands of a degree above absolute zero. And the result could prompt new research in areas ranging from quantum chemistry to tests of the most basic theories in particle physics. Scientists at Yale University have created the world's coldest molecules. Based in Connecticut the experiment chilled them to almost absolute zero. It is the coldest temperature ever recorded for any molecule. Pictured here is an optical cavity used to precisely fine-tune lasers that then trapped and cooled the molecules . The research, published in the journal Nature, was conducted by scientists at Yale University in Connecticut. It involved dropping the temperature of strontium monofluoride with lasers in a process known as magneto-optical trapping (MOT). At almost absolute zero (-273.15°C or -459.67°) they are the coldest molecules ever achieved through direct cooling, representing a physics milestone. ‘We can start studying chemical reactions that are happening at very near to absolute zero,’ said Dr Dave DeMille, a Yale physics professor and principal investigator. ‘We have a chance to learn about fundamental chemical mechanisms.’ Magneto-optical trapping has become very popular with atomic physicists in the past generation - but only at the single-atom level. Absolute zero is the lowest possible temperature where nothing could be colder and no heat energy remains in a substance. Absolute zero can be quantified as -273.15 Celsius, -459.67 Fahrenheit or simply 0 Kelvin. This experiment marks the coldest recorded temperature for molecules, which are groups of two or more atoms. The technology uses lasers to simultaneously cool particles and hold them in place. 'Imagine having a shallow bowl with a little molasses in it,' Dr DeMille explained. 'If you roll some balls into the bowl, they will slow down and accumulate at the bottom. 'For our experiment, the molecules are like the balls and the bowl with molasses is created via laser beams and magnetic fields.' The results could prompt new research into areas such as quantum chemistry. Magneto-optical trapping has become very popular with atomic physicists in the past generation - but only at the single-atom level. This marks the coldest recorded temperature for molecules (illustration shown), groups of two or more atoms . Magneto-optical trapping involves holding molecules in place with lasers. In so doing the physicists were able to cool the molecules to a fraction of a degree above aboslute zero (artist's illustration shown) Until now, the complicated vibrations and rotations of molecules proved too difficult for such trapping. The Yale team's unique approach drew inspiration from a relatively obscure, 1990s research paper that described MOT-type results in a situation where the usual cooling and trapping conditions were not met. Pulses . of strontium monofluoride (SrF) were shot out from a cryogenic chamber . to form a beam of molecules, which is slowed by pushing on it with a . laser. 'It's like trying to slow down a bowling ball with ping pong balls,' Dr DeMille explained. 'You have to do it fast and do it a lot of times.' The . slowed molecules enter a specially-shaped magnetic field, where . opposing laser beams pass through the center of the field, along three . perpendicular axes. This is where the molecules become trapped and subsequently cooled. 'Quantum . mechanics allows us to both cool things down and apply force that . leaves the molecules levitating in an almost perfect vacuum,' Dr DeMille . added. Dr DeMille and his colleagues built their own apparatus in a basement lab. It is an elaborate, multi-level tangle of wires, computers, electrical components, tabletop mirrors and a cryogenic refrigeration unit. The process uses a dozen lasers, each controlled to extremely high precision. 'If you wanted to put a picture of something high-tech in the dictionary, this is what it might look like,' Dr DeMille said. 'It's deeply orderly, but with a bit of chaos.' The Yale team chose strontium monofluoride for its structural simplicity - it has effectively just one electron that orbits around the entire molecule. 'We thought it would be best to start applying this technique with a simple diatomic molecule [those composed of only two atoms],' Dr DeMille said. The discovery opens the door for further experimentation into everything from precision measurement and quantum simulation to ultracold chemistry and tests of the standard model of particle physics.","Scientists at Yale University have created the world's coldest molecules .

"A millionaire's daughter was in an ‘intimate relationship’ with a robber and drug dealer she claimed had forced her to drive a getaway car during last year’s riots, a court heard yesterday. Laura Johnson, 20, said the man, known as Sylar, threatened her by putting his hands around her throat and applying pressure with his thumbs. She claimed she was left terrified after he and two friends spoke of  knives and guns, and showed her mobile phone footage of torture. Laura Johnson, pictured left at court yesterday and right back in September, had been . treated for anxiety and depression before the riots . The Exeter University student said . she was so scared that she drove them around South-East London as they . looted a haul of electrical goods, alcohol and cigarettes on August 9, . one of the worst nights of the riots. However, the prosecution has . dismissed Johnson’s claims, saying she ‘knew what she was doing’. Yesterday, Johnson’s friend Charlie . Fryett told a jury that far from being  terrified, Johnson had behaved . flirtatiously with Sylar, and that the pair were on ‘close’ terms. Miss Fryett, 20, told Inner London . Crown Court that she had met Johnson at Green Parks House psychiatric . outpatients unit in Orpington in April last year. Soon she had . introduced Johnson to lots of her ‘black, male friends’. She said she was aware that Johnson, a . former pupil of St Olave’s Grammar School,  was depressed after . splitting from her boyfriend, and that she had self-harmed and attempted . an overdose. Privileged upbringing: Johnson was accompanied to court by her mother Lindsay (centre) and father  Robert (right), who run direct marketing company Avongate . Wealthy: Johnson, who is reading English and Italian, is the daughter of a millionaire businessman who lives in this home in Orpington, south-east London . Miss Fryett told the court they had . both ‘fancied’ Sylar, who liked to listen to violent gangster rap. However, the girls had drifted apart after he appeared to be more . interested in Johnson. The final straw for their friendship . came on August 9 last year when Miss Fryett phoned Johnson and heard . Sylar’s voice in the background, the jury heard. ‘I felt betrayed, I felt like people were going behind my back again,’ she said. Watched by Johnson’s parents Robert . and Lindsay, who run Avongate, a direct marketing company, she told the . court that Johnson and Sylar had a close relationship: ‘They would meet . up and sit in a car together,’ she said. ‘They had had close contact. They had kissed and stuff. She said he came on to her and whatever happened in the car happened. ‘She was flirting towards him so I blame her for bringing it on. She came across as easy.’ Family home: Johnson has been bailed to her parents' large, detached house in Orpington . A police officer yesterday  also . revealed how he feared for his life when Johnson revved her car engine . at him after he shouted at her to stop. PC Chris Bramley told the jury that . he saw the student sitting in her black Smart car as three black youths . filled it with stolen goods from Comet. Police later found three stolen TVs, . alcohol and cigarettes inside the vehicle, while a microwave was . discovered on the floor nearby. ‘When I approached the front of the car I . heard the engine revving,’ he told the jury. ‘I believed my life was  in danger.

"A Chicago mother says that officials at her daughter's elementary school ignored 'numerous' reports of bullying against the 12-year-old girl — eventually leading her to commit suicide. McKenzie Phlipot, a student at Peirce School of International Studies, killed herself on May 8. Her mother, Beth Martin, is now suing Chicago Public Schools and the Chicago Board of Education, charging that officials shared blame in the 12-year-old girl's death. 'The continued bullying that McKenzie suffered at school should have never been allowed,' Martin, whose suit seeks more than $50,000 in damages, said in a statement. 'McKenzie and I were relying on the administration to help us, but they ignored and dismissed the severity of the problem. 'They did not have McKenzie's back, she felt like she had nowhere to turn.' McKenzie Phlipot, 12, committed suicide in May. Her mom, Beth Martin, is now suing school district officials in Chicago, saying they ignored complaints that she was being tormented at Peirce School . McKenzie's mom said classmates and even a teacher picked on her daughter . Before her death in May, McKenzie made several comments about bullying on her social media accounts. 'Like if u hate bullies,' she wrote on her Instagram account in December. She wrote later: 'Look! All the bullies at my school need to stop talking.' Four days before her death, she  made one final post on Instagram. 'If I died, would you cry? Would you wonder if I was happy?' she wrote ;Would I be on your mind? Would you ever speak my name again? Would you come to my funeral? Would you miss me?... 'Would your heart drop to your stomach when you found out that it was suicide?' Chicago Public Schools have denied that there was any 'credible evidence' that McKenzie was bullied at school. Spokesman Bill McCaffrey on Thursday declined to comment on the lawsuit, DNAinfo Chicago reported. McKenzie's dad, Travis Phlipot, on Thursday went to Peirce School and distributed flyers to parents asking: 'Does your child feel safe at school?' 'Mckenzie Phlipot didn't. Mckenzie was picked on, bullied by other students as well as a teacher,' says the flyer, signed by both parents, according to DNAinfo Chicago. 'Even after her mother complained, the bullying continued. 'She was shoved, punched and even required emergency room visits after being injured at school. One of her teachers repeatedly singled her out and treated her differently than other students. 'Her family's cries for help were ignored,' the flyer concludes. 'Nothing was done.' The lawsuit, filed in Cook County,also alleges that the school failed to notify authorities of the bullying. 'I want McKenzie to have a voice, the one that went unheard while she was alive,' Martin said. 'I live with the pain of McKenzie's loss every day and want to help make sure no other child will have to endure the physical and emotional torment she experienced at school.' Chicago Public Schools has denied there was 'any evidence' that McKenzie was bullied at Peirce School of International Studies .

The memorial consists of 2,711 concrete . slabs on four acres of land in the heart of Berlin, and is visited by . hundreds of thousands of people every year. Mrs Obama and her daughters were joined on the trip by Auma, the president's half-sister, who studied in Germany and lives in Kenya. Mrs Obama and her daughters had dressed in lightweight clothes to combat the blistering hot day in Germany.

Malia was dressed in cropped camel trousers with matching pumps and a pale blue T-shirt while younger sister Sasha wore a darker blue T-shirt and patterned jeans. Auma Obama was dressed in a black shift top and trousers. Auma Obama was born in 1960 and is a year older than her President half-brother. She is the daughter of the President's father Barack Obama Senior and his first wife Kezia. In 1959, Barack Obama Senior, left Africa to take up a scholarship at the University of Hawaii. Auma appears to have been conceived when his father was home on holiday in Kenya. In America, Barack Sr met and married Ann Dunham, an anthropologist from Kansas. But soon after she gave birth to the future president of the United states, he left and returned to Kenya. Auma Obama studied German at the University of Heidelberg from 1981 to 1987 before completing her PhD at the University of Bayreuth in 1996. She married an Englishman Ian Manners in 1996 and lived in London although the couple are now divorced. She is now a development worker in Kenya.

Uwe Neumaerker, director of the foundation for the Memorial to the . Murdered Jews of Europe. Opened in 2005 near the Brandenburg Gate, the field of 2,700 concrete slabs of varying height evokes a cemetery to many visitors and serves as a memorial for the millions of Jewish victims of the Holocaust. Visitors walk along pathways that descend into the heart of a claustrophobic maze. The fate of the millions who were murdered is documented in a subterranean information center below the paths. When . they arrived at the memorial, surrounded by Secret Service officials, . Michelle hugged her youngest daughter as they climbed out of an SUV.

"A newly married couple forced to live on £57 a week killed themselves in despair after being 'abandoned' by social services, their friends claimed yesterday. The bodies of Mark and Helen Mullins were found lying side by side at their run-down home in an apparent suicide pact. News of the tragedy emerged yesterday as friends told how they had been forced to live 'hand to mouth', making a weekly 12-mile trip to a soup kitchen on foot after Mrs Mullins' benefits were stopped 18 months ago. Mark and Helen Mullins: Lived in just one room of their run-down home . Tragic: Mark and Helen Mullins could not face another freezing winter on the poverty line, according to neighbours . Military man: Mr Mullins served as a PE teacher in the Army but fell on hard times after leaving the service . The couple were given free vegetables . at the soup kitchen in Coventry each Sunday, which they boiled into a . broth on a camping stove. They lived in just one room of their . terraced house to save on heating costs and could not afford a fridge so . kept their food in plastic bags in the garden. They are believed to have killed . themselves after 18 months of struggling to survive on the £57.50 . Jobseeker's Allowance payment Mr Mullins, a 48-year-old former Army . physical training instructor, was able to claim. Their heart-breaking plight was . revealed yesterday, five days after their bodies were discovered at . their council house in Bedworth, Warwickshire. Charity workers who befriended the couple said society had allowed them to 'slip through the net'. Mrs Mullins, 59, suffered from . learning difficulties and social services are understood to have taken . her 12-year-old daughter away last year after she was considered to be . incapable of looking after her. As a result, her child benefits were . stopped but she was ineligible to claim Jobseeker's Allowance because . she was not deemed fit to work. She was also told she did not qualify . for incapacity benefit because she had not been officially diagnosed . with a medical condition. Mr Mullins was his wife's full-time . carer. He fought to get a carer's allowance but was told he could not . claim until she was diagnosed with a disorder. Run-down: The property that Mark and Helen Mullins shared as they lived on £57.50 per week . Officers discovered their bodies . after neighbours reported they had not been seen for some days. Kervin . Julien, who runs the Salvation Army soup kitchen in Coventry used by the . couple, said: 'The question needs to be asked – why was it they felt . they had no one else to turn to? 'It's sad that in this day and age we . have still got prehistoric services that are not meeting the needs of . the people who need them.' Mark and Helen Mullins were left living on a measly £57.50 per week in a run-down property which has now been boarded up. They would have received an additional £20.30 per week in child benefit before their 12-year-old was taken off them. Helen was not eligible for disability benefit despite having learning difficulties because they feared she would be put into care if the full extent of her problems were known, friends said. Mark had not been in the forces for long enough to claim a pension. Mr Julien, who appeared in TV programme The Secret Millionaire, added: 'They walked everywhere hand in hand, like young lovers. 'Mark talked about the authorities taking Helen's daughter away from her but not acknowledging her mental health problems. 'They had been staying with relatives . and friends to try and avoid the authorities, as they believed they . wanted to section Helen. They just wanted support.' It is understood the couple married . in July last year, shortly after they appeared in an online documentary . about people living below the poverty line in Warwickshire. Mr Mullins said in the interview: . 'The job centre decided Helen couldn't sign on as she was incapable of . employment as she has no literacy and numeracy skills. Mr . and Mrs Mullins were forced to walk ten miles each week into Coventry . city centre to a soup kitchen where they could get free vegetables . 'However, the incapacity people . wouldn't recognise her disabilities. We're in a catch 22 situation. We're living hand to mouth.' One neighbour said: 'The authorities turned their back on them. 'They obviously couldn't face another freezing winter and felt they had no other choice but to kill themselves.' Police said they were not looking for . anyone else in connection with the deaths. Warwickshire County Council . refused to comment because the couple are yet to be formally identified. A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: 'The couple in question had been receiving weekly benefits from the department since February 2010 - these included money for disability and caring responsibilities as well as out of work support. 'We had not received any complaint from them about their benefit claim.'","Every month the couple walked 12 miles to a soup kitchen to get free food .

"A San Diego street gang operated a vast nationwide prostitution ring that spanned 46 cities in 23 states, federal prosecutors revealed on Wednesday. The group promised luxury lifestyles to girls and women but instead they were branded with tattoos and bar codes, and treated like slaves. 'The kind of sex trafficking described in this indictment is nothing less than modern-day slavery,' said U.S. Attorney Laura Duffy as she announced racketeering conspiracy charges for 24 people. Scene: A San Diego ran a massive prostitution ring that subjected women to horrific conditions from the North Park neighborhood of the city . Reach: The network was run by a gang known as BMS, which traces its origins to San Diego's increasingly gentrified North Park neighborhood in the early 1990s. The ring grew to span 46 cities in 23 states . 'Unfortunately, more gangs are expanding from traditional pursuits like drug dealing into this lucrative business,' Duffy explained. The 24 suspects were all San Diego residents aged between 22 and 36. Seventeen of those indicted were arrested in California, Arizona and New Jersey on Wednesday in police and FBI raids. Four other defendants were already in custody and three remained at-large. The indictment alleges that women and girls were recruited from city streets or social media to join the sex-trafficking ring. The victims then had to deliver their earnings to pimps in exchange for protection, food, housing, clothing and cars. Shock: 'The kind of sex trafficking described in this indictment is nothing less than modern-day slavery,' said U.S. Attorney Laura Duffy . The network was run by a gang known . as BMS, which traces its origins to San Diego's increasingly gentrified . North Park neighborhood in the early 1990s.

Members would post photos and videos on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter advertising a high life of jewelry, champagne and parties. But gang members would use threats or actual violence to force them into prostitution, and often tattooed gang monikers, pimps' names and bar codes on them. Authorities also seized luxury cars, . dozens of Air Jordan shoes and pimp paraphernalia like diamond-studded . canes, hats and chalices, much of which prosecutors said they would seek . to have forfeited. Skyline: The 24 suspects were all San Diego residents aged between 22 and 36 . Many defendants, facing racketeering conspiracy charges traditionally used for organized-crime syndicates, were scheduled to make initial court appearances Thursday in San Diego. Fourteen of those arrested could get life in prison if convicted. The U.S. attorney's office said authorities have offered assistance to 60 female victims, including 11 children. A similar prosecution of a gang-run prostitution ring in nearby Oceanside in 2011 led to the indictment of 39 people 34 of whom have since pleaded guilty.","San Diego street gang ran prostitution ring across 46 cities in 23 states .

"Scientists have announced that they might have found water clouds beyond the solar system for the first time. The discovery was made on a brown dwarf, a gas giant planet that failed to become a star, 7.3 light-years from Earth. If true, the sighting would be an important step to finding habitable planets like our own in the future. Scroll down for video . Astronomers in Washington DC have found the first ever evidence for water clouds beyond the solar system. The discovery was made on a 'failed star' (artist's impression shown) 7.3 light-years from Earth. The object is a brown dwarf called WISE J0855-0714 that is up to 10 times the mass of Jupiter . A brown dwarf is commonly regarded as the ‘missing link’ between stars and planets. They are too large to be classed as true planets, but too small to have ignited nuclear fusion at their cores and be classed as stars. When a celestial body first forms, its size will determine what sort of object it becomes. As a star forms from a cloud of gas, its core becomes so large that hydrogen fuses into helium . Conversely, a planet forms into a smaller sphere that is not large enough to have nuclear fusion at its core. Brown dwarfs fall somewhere in between. They are the size between a gas giant like Jupiter and a small star. Their mass, meanwhile, can be anything from 15 to 75 times the mass of Jupiter. This is not enough to sustain fusion but, owing to their size, this has led astronomers to coin brown dwarfs ‘failed stars’. As they do not emit much light, it’s thought there may be many rogue brown dwarfs drifting through the galaxy waiting to be discovered. The finding was announced by a team led by Dr Jacqueline Faherty of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington DC. The object in question is the coldest brown dwarf ever found, WISE J0855-0714, with a temperature between -48 and -13°C (-55 and 8°F). To make the discovery, Dr Faherty combined 151 near-infrared images of the world using the 6.5-metre (21 feet) Magellan Baade telescope in Chile. This revealed that the colour of the gas giant matches the predicted models of a brown dwarf with clouds of water ice in its atmosphere. While water vapour has been spotted in exoplanets before, this is the first time water clouds have been spotted. It’s thought that as much as half of the planet is obscured by clouds, making it a partly cloudy world like Earth. Even in our own solar system, the only water clouds known of are on Earth and Mars; for the giant planets like Jupiter and Saturn, they are too cold and ammonia ice clouds cover suspected water clouds below. And finding a partly cloudy world is important, as aside from Earth most other planets with clouds we know of such as Venus and Jupiter are blanketed in clouds, with no apparent break to the surface. WISE J0855-0714 is one of the closest 'stars' to Earth at just 7.3 light-years away. The year when each system was determined is listed in brackets under each object. WISE J0855-0714 is also the coldest brown dwarf ever found, with a temperature between -48 and -13°C (-55 and 8°F) ‘I've been obsessed with this object since its discovery,’ Dr Faherty said in Science. ‘I went to battle at the telescope to try and get this detection. ‘I wanted to put war paint under my eyes and wear a bandanna, because I knew this was not going to be an easy thing to do. ‘At the telescope, I've never been so nervous. I've never wanted clear conditions so badly.’ Ultimately, after three nights of observations, Dr Faherty made the groundbreaking discovery. Follow-up studies from observatories like the James Webb Space Telescope, set to launch in 2018, will be used to confirm the findings.","Astronomers in Washington DC have found the first ever evidence for water clouds beyond the solar system .

A police affidavit said that, before the bodies were found, Sumeet Dhawan told investigators that his wife was having mental health issues and that they had been having marital problems. A medical examiner's report filed earlier this year said that Arnav hadmost likely died of natural causes in the bath. However police said Pallavi Dhawan had confessed killing her son. This claim has been strenuously denied by the family's attorney, David Finn. Finn has said that Arnav was a special-needs child, born with a brain cyst and microcephaly, a condition characterized by an abnormally small head, which may have factored in his death. The scene: Frisco Fire and Police department officials cover the back gate as they investigate the scene at the home of Pallavi and Sumeet Dhawan on September 3, 2014 . Finn said that he spoke with the couple days before their death and that he didn't notice any changes in behavior. However, he did say that Pallavi was under great stress during the investigation and that Sumeet told Frisco police that his wife had been depressed, perhaps suicidal. Pallavi wanted to travel to a city in India to pray for her dead son but she was unable to get a passport due to her pending criminal case. Last month, Finn said he had been in contact with Sumeet Dhawan's relatives, who had hoped to send the bodies back to India for cremation in accordance with Hindu tradition. It's not clear if the bodies were in a condition suitable for the trip. If they aren't, 'they'll be cremated and the ashes sent back to India,' Finn said. FOX reported that the couple's  Finn said that Pallavi's mother had contacted him from India to ask him to help in bringing Pallavi's and Sumeet's remains home for cremation. Mourning: Arnav's parents, pictured months ago, wanted to be able to travel to India to honor their son but Pallavi was unable to get a passport in time . Fox spoke with SMU theology professor Robert Hunt about the cultural importance of honoring the dead and about times when the Hindu religion allows for suicide. 'It's not only critically important as they think hopefully about the soul of the departed person, but this becomes a dangerous entity in a sense for the family, and to a certain extent brings an amount of shame and guilt to the family in terms of their wider relations,' said Robert Hunt. 'The very fact of being charged, the very fact of having an investigation go to a grand jury can being a deep sense of guilt and shame that, for an American, isn't going to be the first thing that happens,' said Hunt. He said that the Hindu belief generally rejects suicide but in some cases relating to great injustice, suicide if forgivable or even the right thing to do. 'Generally speaking, the cause of it, or the ostensible cause of it, is, and what makes it right, I should say, is that it calls attention to a grave injustice,' said Hunter. 'It becomes the only way that a completely powerless person can say, ‘This is unjust.'” Charged with murder: Pallavi Dhawan was a suburban Dallas mother, charged with murdering her 10-year-old son, Arnav Dhawan, who was developmentally challenged. She killed herself and her husband last month .

"Earlier this week scientists were left baffled by a huge feature that surfaced in the seas of Titan that measured a staggering 100 square miles (260sq km) - the size of Washington DC or the city of Birmingham in the UK. And in the latest speculation a number of theories have been considered including a giant iceberg and a huge field of bubbles. Speaking to MailOnline, two scientists explained their thoughts on what it might have been and that they hope to learn more upon repeated observations early next year. In this series of images from the Cassini spacecraft the giant object 100 square miles (260 square kilometres) in size is seen rising out of one of Titan's largest seas before disappearing again. In the latest image on the right the object still seems to be partially submerged beneath the surface . In July 2013 the giant feature was seen surfacing from under the liquid before partially disappearing again in August this year. Regarding the iceberg theory one scientist explains how, if it's the correct assumption, they might differ to icebergs on Earth. 'For a bit of background, on Earth it's quite a simple situation because ice floats in water,' Jason Hofgartner, a graduate student at Cornell University who works on the Cassini Radar Science Team, tells MailOnline. 'On Titan it's more complicated because you have a methane and ethane mixture, we think, and there's nitrogen from the atmosphere that also gets dissolved. The iceberg theory is one of the more favoured ones at the moment. This suggests some frozen mass, perhaps frozen methane and ethane, was dislodged from the seabed and rose to the surface. Another theory is that this may be a vast field of bubbles released by underground vents of volcanoes that are now resting on the surface. It could also be surface waves drifting across the sea, although this theory is unlikely as Titan is tidally locked to Saturn (the same face also points towards the planet) so its seas to not have tides as dramatic as those seen on Earth. One theory that that has been ruled out is that this is a land mass. Jason Hofgartner from Cornell University says if it was it would have been visible under the liquid in the previous images. 'So when you freeze it, it undergoes complicated composition changes. 'Whether you can get icebergs that can float is a matter for debate, but it's possible. 'When it warms those icebergs could switch from sinking to floating.' Hofgartner explains how the northern hemisphere, where the iceberg was spotted, is currently transitioning from spring time to summer. This process might be responsible for warming the sub-surface icebergs, which then caused them to rise from the seabed. Other processes like currents in the sea could also be dislodging such features. Another theory is that it is a bubble, although not necessarily a giant bubble across the whole feature. Hofgartner says it could be a series of smaller bubbles spread over the huge area, each perhaps just centimetres in size. The cause of these bubbles could be vents, undersea volcanoes or  seasonal changes. One theory that can be ruled out, however, is that this is some sort of giant non-ice land mass that has risen from the depths. This is because the radar system on Cassini can penetrate into the liquid so it would have spotted such a land mass. 'If this was a land mass or mud flat under the sea, we should have seen it in earlier images because the radar would have penetrated,' he explains. A comparison image from 26 April 2007 (left) shows how no similar feature was previously spotted in the region of interest. The feature was spotted by Nasa's Cassini spacecraft, which is currently in orbit around the Saturnian system. On the right is an image of Titan in orbit around Saturn . Another feature of the images is that the object appears to be fading. 'I don't know if that's anything to do with what's under the liquid; we see it's decreased in brightness an extending. 'So what could be happening is it's spreading out and becoming less concentrated in one area, and spreading into a larger area.' The feature is certainly rare, although it's possible that more may be spotted in future. This specific area will be imaged by radar again early in 2015, and exactly what state the feature is in will surely be of huge interest. One of Nasa's future proposals to Titan is for a boat to sail the seas, but Hofgartner says features like this would not necessarily be a threat to such a mission. 'Perhaps the boat could help us nail down what is happening here,' he says. This is an artist's impression of the Titan Mare Explorer (TiME) capsule, a proposed mission to perform the first direct inspection of an ocean environment beyond Earth by landing in, and floating on, a methane-ethane sea on Saturn’s largest moon: Titan . Speaking to MailOnline Professor of Planetary Plasma Physics Emma Bunce from the University of Leicester, who also works on the Cassini mission, agreed that it may have been some sort of iceberg akin to something we see on Earth. 'It could be something floating that sunk and came back to the surface,' she says. 'I was thinking almost like an iceberg, similar to something in Earth's oceans.' But she doesn't rule out the possibility of it being some sort of giant bubble, or even surface waves. She goes on to explain that the feature may have arisen due to the change in season at Saturn. The first image in 2007 was taken 'around Saturn equinox [when the sun is above the equator], and then the latest image is now heading towards northern summer solstice on Saturn. 'That's sort of an ongoing theme for a lot of the Cassini results; a lot of things depend on the season at Saturn as it moves in orbit. 'Because this lake itself is actually near to Titan's northern pole, perhaps it is something to do with illumination conditions.' The feature was spotted in Ligeia Mare (shown), one of the largest seas on Titan, and was observed by Cassini's radar experiment. Several theories currently exist including surface waves, rising bubbles, floating solids, solids suspended just below the surface or 'something more exotic' according to Nasa . The feature was spotted by Nasa's Cassini spacecraft, which is currently in orbit around the Saturnian system. It was spotted in Ligeia Mare, one of the largest seas on Titan, and was observed by Cassini's radar instrument. In images from 10 July 2013 to 21 August 2014 the feature is shown rising and then falling below the surface. With its thick atmosphere and organic-rich chemistry, Titan resembles a frozen version of Earth several billion years ago, before life began pumping oxygen into our atmosphere. Because Titan is smaller than Earth, its gravity doesn't hold onto its gaseous envelope as tightly, so the atmosphere extends 370 miles (595 kilometres) into space. As on Earth, the climate is driven mostly by changes in the amount of sunlight that comes with the seasons, although the seasons on Titan are about seven Earth years long. Titan's 'water' is liquid methane, CH4, better known on Earth as natural gas. Regular Earth-water, H2O, would be frozen solid on Titan where the surface temperature is -180°C (-292°F). With Titan's low gravity and dense atmosphere, methane raindrops could grow twice as large as Earth's raindrops. As well as this, they would fall more slowly, drifting down like snowflakes. But scientists think it rains perhaps only every few decades. A comparison image from 26 April 2007 shows how no similar feature was previously spotted in that region. The mysterious feature appears bright in the radar images, suggesting it has a somewhat similar composition to the land nearby in the image. This supports one theory that it may be a solid structure  that surfaced from under the liquid before sinking again for an unknown reason. The dark area in the image is the liquid hydrocarbon sea on Titan's surface, while the bright area to the right is land. Scientists on the radar team are confident that the feature is not an artifact - or flaw - in their data. They have also ruled out the possibility of it being due to evaporation, as the nearby shoreline has not changed much. Several theories currently exist including surface waves, rising bubbles, floating solids, solids suspended just below the surface or 'something more exotic' according to Nasa. The appearance of the feature may also be due to changing seasons on Titan, with summer drawing near in the moon's northern hemisphere. Monitoring these changes is a major goal of Cassini's current extended mission. 'Science loves a mystery, and with this enigmatic feature, we have a thrilling example of ongoing change on Titan,' said Dr Stephen Wall, the deputy team lead of Cassini's radar team, based at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. 'We're hopeful that we'll be able to continue watching the changes unfold and gain insights about what's going on in that alien sea.' It's not just Titan that is thought to have an active surface; earlier this month scientists found the first sign of geologic activity on a solar system world other than Earth - Europa. Experts from the University of Idaho and the Johns Hopkins University, Maryland, say Europa could be more Earth-like than experts imagined. The latest find appears to solve a puzzle that has perplexed planetary scientists. It shows where old crust was destroyed and how the icy crust is expanding. Many parts of Europa's surface show evidence of extension, where wide bands - up to tens of miles wide - formed as the surface ripped apart, and fresh icy material from the underlying shell moved into the newly created gap, a process akin to terrestrial seafloor spreading, according to the study published in the journal Nature Geoscience. Europa's surface is considered to be relatively young at between 40 and 90 millions of years old, which can perhaps now be explained by plate tectonics. It has been a decade since Cassini entered orbit around Saturn (illustration shown). In June the Cassini mission celebrated 10 years of exploring the planet, its rings and moons. It arrived for a four-year mission but has since been continuously extended, although it will almost certainly end in 2017 .","Two scientists have told MailOnline that they think the giant object on Saturn's moon Titan could have been an iceberg .

"Despite new cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Jason Greenslate - the 'food stamp surfer' who shot to infamy last year for proudly declaring he eats lobster and sushi and won't get a job - continues to get food stamps. And, what's more, the 29-year-old guitarist says his band, Ratt Life, is on its way to making millions. Fox News again profiled the mooching muso this week and showed him driving a Cadillac Escalade and going to stip clubs, while still collecting $200 each month in food stamps. 'It looks like a good time, man,' Greenslate told the network. Despite the US being in debt to the tune of $17 trillion, Greenslate said he refuses to feel bad about staying in the system. Nice wheels, man: Mooching muso Jason Greenslate, 29, says that collecting $200 each month in food stamps has helped him focus on his burgeoning music career - as well as drive an Escalade, eat lobster and go to strip clubs . No apologies: Jason Greenslate says he has no reason to feel guilty about his alleged abuse of the food stamps system . Jason Greenslate says he plans to be off food stamps in one month as he music career takes off . 'Do I have to apologize for the way the system's set up? I don't feel I need to apologize,' Greenslate said, sensing Watters' disapproval. 'It's just the way you're wording it kinda seems I'm getting the ruler on the hand, you know?' The freeloaded maintains food stamps have helped him focus on his career . 'If everything's planned out right I should be off food stamps in a month,' he said, adding that his band will make 'millions and millions' with their forthcoming album. Ratt Life are in the final stages of production on the album but are not signed to a record label. Greenslate hit headlines in September for his unapologetic appearance on a Fox News segment about people who abuse the nation's food stamp system. 'This is the way I want to live and I don’t really see anything . changing,' Greenslate said in the interview. 'It’s free . food; it’s awesome.' Dig in: Greenslate and his friends enjoy some taxpayer-funded lobster as they drink beer and play guitars . During a later interview with the Huffington Post, Greenslate added: 'I don't feel like a bum. I pull hot chicks, drive nice cars, . dress nice and wear the most baddest jewelry in the world.' During the segment, Greenslate is seen driving expensive cars, drinking beer and grilling lobsters with his friends. Before the cookout, cameras followed Greenslate into a grocery store and watched him purchase the food with his government-issued Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) card. With the card - which only needs to be . renewed once a year - Greenslate is given $200 a month for food. There . is no requirement that he even look for employment. SNAP: Greenslate is given $200 a month for food on his SNAP card, which features the California coast . Previously, there were stipulations that food stamp recipients with no family could only receive food stamps for three months every three years unless they had part time employment or were involved in a jobs program. The goal was to help people who couldn't make ends meet, not supplement income so people could surf and drink beer. Many of those types of restrictions were eliminated when President Barack Obama signed the 2009 stimulus bill, which allows people like Greenslate to abuse the system. On Thursday, Congress passed a bill that would reduce food stamp spending by five percent. Prior to the vote, Congressional leaders were shown the video featuring Greenslate.

'You can no longer sit on your couch or ride a surfboard like Jason in California and expect the federal taxpayer to feed you,' Congressman Tim Huelskamp said following the vote. Republicans in Congress have used Greenslate as the poster-child for the need for entitlement reform. But Democrats have cast aside that notion, claiming that he doesn't represent the majority of the people who receive assistance. 'I don't give a damn about a surfer dude,' Democratic Congressman Jim McGovern said. 'As far . as I'm concerned, he can walk off the nearest pier. To suggest that . he's the face of SNAP is offensive.' As for the Congressional vote, Greenslate noted: 'I don't think that one person should be the decision for 47 million people.'","Jason Greenslate, 29, of San Diego, is given $200 in food stamps a month .

"A mother from Pennsylvania has been charged with assault and child endangerment after police say she forced her adopted teenage daughter to eat used cat litter and toothpaste, and started to sew her mouth shut with a needle. Rana Cooper, 46, was arrested this week for what police are calling excessive punishment and neglect that also included forcing her 16-year-old daughter to scrape the inside of a toilet and eat what was on her finger. According to police, the teen had to earn enough points for cleaning the house just so she could eat or use the bathroom. Scroll down for video . House of horrors: Police say Rana Cooper, 46, has been viciously abusing her adopted 16-year-old daughter in the family's home in Avella, Pennsylvania . Cooper also was charged with reckless endangerment and endangering the welfare of the girl she and her husband, Richard, adopted in 2008 when she was 10 years old. The couple have six other children. The disturbing allegations of physical abuse include beatings with a hair brush, being spat on and being choked to the point of blacking out. The matter came to light in May, as child welfare authorities in Washington County were investigating an alleged assault at the girl's school. The arrest affidavit filed with Cooper's charges listed other instances of alleged abuse, including not letting the girl eat with the rest of the family, sitting on the child for minutes at a time, force feeding her until she vomited, making her eat half a tube of toothpaste and jamming a Q-tip into her ear causing partial loss of hearing. 'If it was time to eat and no one else was around, mother would allow child to eat and would make the child shovel food quickly into her mouth,' wrote state police Cpl. Robert Copechal. 'Mother would then make the child tell mother that she was eating one of her brothers.' The teenager told investigators that Richard Cooper, 51, witnessed his wife choking her. The husband told Rana Cooper to stop, the girl told authorities, but when she did not he 'proceeded to just stand there and watch.' According to the child, Cooper bit her nose until it bled, hit her in the face with a metal belt buckle, forced her to stand in the corner on drywall screws and made an attempt to sew her mouth shut with a needle and thread, but stopped after piercing her bottom lip. Inhumane: The mother allegedly made her adopted daughter eat dirty cat litter . The mother also allegedly threatened to gouge the teen's eyes out and slice off her tongue. According to the alleged victim, she was also repeatedly bitten by the family's pet Dobermans. Rana Cooper gave police a written statement last month in which she admitted to holding her daughter's head under water for three to 10 seconds, police said. However, Cooper's 24-year-old son, Ronnie, has come to his mother's defense insisting that the allegations of abuse against her were false. 'Nothing, none of that happened,' Ronnie Cooper told KDKA. 'None of these are true.' The girl has since been removed from the home and put in the care of an older brother and another caretaker.","Rana Cooper, 46, from Avella, Pennsylvania, charged with simple assault and child endangerment .

"The widow of Bernie Madoff's son who hanged himself was being sued for millions by victims of her father-in-law's Ponzi scheme. Stephanie Mack, Mark Madoff's widow, was just one of a list of family members hit with an expanded $255.3 million lawsuit, saying they should have caught the patriarch's Ponzi scheme and must return the benefits to victims. Irving Picard, the trustee seeking money for Madoff's victims, said family members who worked at Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC were 'completely derelict' in ensuring that the New York investment firm's operations were legal. Retribution: Irving Picard, the trustee seeking money for Madoff's victims, said family members including Stephanie Mack (right) were 'completely derelict' in making sure the firm's operations were legal . The lawsuit added three former spouses of Madoff's sons as defendants. Picard said they were unjustly enriched by the scheme through their marriages, and that 'equity and good conscience' required that they forfeit money to victims, whom he believes are owed $20 billion overall. Picard filed his complaint late last Friday with the U.S. bankruptcy court in Manhattan, one month after winning court approval to add the spouses. The case has grown from $226.4 million in November, and $198.7 million in October 2009. The family defendants are Madoff's brother Peter, who was the Madoff firm's chief compliance officer; son Andrew, who was co-director of trading; the estate of son Mark, who was also co-director of trading and committed suicide in December 2010; and niece Shana, a compliance officer. Sham: Bernie and Ruth Madoff with their son Mark in November 2001. Unable to cope with the aftermath of his father's public downfall, he killed himself . Ripped apart: Stephanie with her late husband Mark Madoff who took his own life when he could not live with the shame of his father's deception . The spouse defendants are Deborah Madoff, who began divorce proceedings against Andrew Madoff in 2008; Stephanie Mack, Mark Madoff's widow; and Susan Elkin, who divorced Mark Madoff in 2000. Doomed: The building where Mark Madoff lived with his wife and children and later hanged himself in December 2010 . Picard now seeks $90.4 million from Peter Madoff, $81.3 million from Mark Madoff's estate, $73.8 million from Andrew Madoff, $15.3 million from Shana Madoff, $27.7 million from Deborah Madoff, $27.5 million from Mack, and $2.4 million from Elkin. Some claims overlap. Like many others sued by Picard, the defendants have said the trustee waited too long to bring some of his claims. The family defendants have long said their activities at Madoff's firm were legitimate, and that he betrayed them. Bernie Madoff was arrested on . December 11, 2008, and pleaded guilty three months later. Now 74, he is . serving a 150-year term in a North Carolina prison. Litigation has prevented Picard from distributing much of the $9.1 billion he has recovered for victims. Just $1.1 billion has been . distributed, including $791 million from the Securities Investor . Protection Corp, Picard said in a April 25 filing. The trustee is appealing several . court decisions dismissing many of his biggest claims, largely against . banks that dealt with Bernard Madoff. Through .

"A French tourist has been arrested for scaling Brooklyn Bridge in an apparent attempt to take photos of the view, according to police. The man, identified as Yonathan Souid, 23, from Esnandes in south western France, faces charges of reckless endangerment and criminal trespassing. It is the third such incident in just four months, following the similar arrest of a Russian tourist in August and a stunt by two German artists to replace the U.S. Stars and Stripes with white flags - a move which raised questions about security on the bridge.

Wong move: The man, identified as Yonathan Souid, 23, from Esnandes in south western France, faces charges of reckless endangerment and criminal trespassing . Souid was arrested after jumping a fence and climbing up a beam on the bridge that connects Manhattan and Brooklyn, a police spokesman confirmed. The incident occurred around 12:30pm local time (17.30 GMT) and Souid climbed back down at the request of a patrol officer, who saw him, and was detained.

In broad daylight: The incident occurred around 12:30pm local time and Souid climbed back down at the request of a patrol officer, who saw him, and was detained . He is due to be formally charged today, said a spokesman from the Brooklyn prosecutor's office. He has remained in custody. 'The Brooklyn Bridge must not be trespassed upon, no matter who does it or for any reason,' said Brooklyn District Attorney Ken Thompson. 'In this age of terrorism, it's very important that we protect the security of the bridge at all times and under all circumstances,' he added. Trouble: Souid is due to be formally charged today, said a spokesman from the Brooklyn prosecutor's office . Lesson learned: 'The Brooklyn Bridge must not be trespassed upon, no matter who does it or for any reason,' said Brooklyn District Attorney Ken Thompson . High security: 'In this age of terrorism, it's very important that we protect the security of the bridge at all times and under all circumstances,' he added . Growing trend: It is the third similar incident at the Brooklyn Bridge in the last four months, in a city highly sensitive to security risks . 'This defendant blatantly compromised that security for his own selfish reasons and will now be prosecuted for his foolish and unlawful conduct.' It is the third similar incident at the Brooklyn Bridge in the last four months, in a city highly sensitive to security risks. In late August, a Russian tourist, Yaroslav Kolchin, 24, was arrested and charged for climbing to the top of one of the towers supporting the mighty structure to take photos. Similar story: Russian tourist, Yaroslav Kolchin managed to make it to the top of the 277-foot bridge before authorities arrived to coax him down back in August . Magic act: Two German tourists scaled the bridge and replaced the American flags atop the landmark with white ones back in July this year . And in late July in the middle of the night, two German artists climbed to the top of the bridge to hoist two white flags in place of the US stars and stripes. The appearance of the white flags prompted a police investigation, which ruled out any terrorist link. The Berlin-based artists, Mischa Leinkauf, 37, and Matthias Wermke, 35, later claimed the stunt, saying they wanted to honour the beauty of public space.","Frenchman Yonathan Souid, 23, climbed a beam to 'take photos'

"When it comes to online dating, if only there were a way of skipping through the sleazy messages, past the late-night chats that lead nowhere and, worst of all, beyond that tireless trawl of hoping the next head-shot to pop up is your happily ever after. Well apparently there is - and it involves outsourcing. Meet Espree Devora, an LA-based self-titled entrepreneur and self-confessed 'super nerd' who decided she was too busy to waste 'several hours a week' trying to find a man online. So since since March, she has had an assistant do it on her behalf. 'I’m a passionate entrepreneur obsessed with being resourceful and productive so I like to spend my time working on my company rather than emailing with strangers,' Devora told Kernel Mag. 'A lot of these guys send me ridiculous waste of time emails so why not have someone else weed through it all?' Time-poor: Espree Devora, an LA entrepreneur, has had her assistant manage numerous online dating profiles for her since March. Now, not happy with the subsequent 'blind dates', she is taking out a Facebook ad leading men to a page describing exactly who she is and exactly what she wants. This is the main picture on that page . The process is simple, according to Devora, who maintains she is not deceiving any of her respective dates. 'My remote assistant logs into multiple online dating accounts that are mine and finds guys she thinks would be a good fit for me,' she said. 'She emails them saying she thinks her boss and the potential guy would get along well and should meet. 'If he’s interested, the guy and she set up the date and I simply show up. 'She is 100% honest and doesn’t pretend to be me or anything. 'Honesty is important to me.' 'Super fun': Espree Devora has been blogging about her experiences anonymously on a site called Outsourcing Your Love Life . By not having to do any of the work herself, the pursuit also means each date is a blind one. 'I am really open minded,' Devora said. 'I don’t look at any of the profiles so for me all the dates are blind dates. 'I have nothing to lose, only a potential wonderful relationship to gain. 'Some guys may not be the types I would have chosen for myself, but it could work. 'It’s an adventure and I meet awesome people. ' However, despite such an extravagant means, the new-gen hunt for Mr Right has so far not worked. Devora says she now doesn't want to wait for the guys to respond to her assistant. And so nother new plan has been hatched to use a paid Facebook ad to promote her 'single and ready to mingle status'. Plan B: Espree Devora now intends to turn Facebook into her own online dating profile, paying for ad that will link interested guys to a page all about her . The ad will link to a page that will detail the many aspects of her life, such as her love of skateboarding, indie movies and 6am workouts. It will also include links to places where men interested can 'cyber stalk' her, such as Twitter. There are also quotes from friends and family describing what Devora is like. The standout is from 'Canadian best friend' Liam Martin, who said: 'Hold on tight, Espree is a wild ride.'","Los Angeles-based Espree Devora, a self-employed entrepreneur, has been outsourcing her into dating since March .

"Look, I admire Dame Judi Dench. You admire Dame Judi Dench. In interviews, even Dame Judi gives the impression of a pleasantly high opinion of herself and her gifts. Much the same could be said of her fellow national treasure Dame Helen Mirren. But do you think that these nicely ageing actresses are the most inspirational women ever to grace our planet? According to a survey this week, that is exactly what we do think. Pale imitation: Helen Mirren playing Her Majesty and, left, the real deal . Four thousand women were asked to nominate the top 100 ‘spirited and inspiring’ women of all time and, lo, Dame Judi and Dame Helen came in as the top two. In a cursory concession to the real world, they were followed in third place by suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst, but normal order of play then resumed, with Dawn French in fourth and Joanna Lumley in fifth. The list is one of the most depressing snapshots of the aspirations of women today that it is possible to imagine. Unbelievably, 14 of those included are fictional characters, such as Elizabeth Bennett from Pride And Prejudice (who is at number 11), Jane Eyre (20) and — wait for it — Bridget Jones (15). More than half owe their inclusion to their place in the ditzy worlds of showbusiness, fashion and ‘celebrity’. There is a smattering of sportswomen —  the highest ranking, at 33, is Jessica Ennis — but I suspect even that elevated position might well owe more to her glamour than her guts. There’s a nod to the notion that some of the 4,000 female voters watch the news: Burma’s brave opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi is in the bottom 50. And Harper Lee, whose book To Kill A Mockingbird laid bare the racism of the American Deep South, did squeak in. At number 100. Inspirational? Judi Dench played a boss of MI5 and Dawn French a vicar but what of the real women who fulfill these roles? Otherwise, there is an indecent showing for women famous for nothing more than the man they married. (Cherie Blair ‘inspirational’? Really?) Then there’s a handful of general do-gooders, and you may make your own category for Cleopatra. Women who have made it in business? Three. Art? One. Science? One — Marie Curie (22), just below Beyonce. Medicine, architecture, engineering, philosophy, spiritual leadership? All zero. As style over substance, the top 100 surpasses itself. As a measure of women’s ‘thinking’, it’s a shocker. The fixation that this purportedly representative 4,000 appear to have with celebrity and showbusiness is not lacking  in irony. Real women and achievement lie forgotten in the rush to revere the cosmetic and make-believe. Dame Judi Dench wins, it is assumed, thanks to acclaim for her appearance as M in the James Bond film Skyfall. Yet Stella Rimington, who actually ran MI5, didn’t even make it on to this ‘inspirational’ list. By the same token, Dame Helen Mirren became famous as fictional Detective Superintendent Jane Tennison in TV’s Prime Suspect. So what of Pauline Clare, Britain’s first female chief constable? She’s in the cold. Only worthy candidate in the top five: Emmeline Pankhurst . Dame Helen owes even more of her fame to her portrayals of the Queen. But while the actress is the runner-up in the list, the real Queen only makes it to 28 — just below Helena Bonham Carter, who played the Queen Mother in The King’s Speech. As for Dawn French at number four, I slightly know and greatly like her. If the poll were for a smile to rival the Blackpool Illuminations, she’d have my vote. But she isn’t up there for being Dawn. She’s up there for her role as the nation’s best-loved pretend vicar, using words written by — naturally — a man. The real-life rector of St James’s in Piccadilly, the Rev Lucy Winkett, is widely tipped to become the first Church of England woman bishop. Yet is she on the ‘inspirational’ women list? No. But this list is nothing but a bit of fun, I hear you say. And part of me agrees with you: commissioned by Baileys, it’s there to sell you sticky booze. Nevertheless, it rankles. And here’s why. Imagine doing the same survey of 4,000 men and asking who they find inspirational. Similar results would be inconceivable. I’ve sat in enough rowdy pubs to know who we’d find on the list, and it certainly wouldn’t be George Clooney or Robbie Williams. They’d go for changing the world (Apple’s Steve Jobs), stretching the boundaries of human endurance (Sir Ranulph Fiennes), business genius (Richard Branson), intellectual brilliance (Stephen Hawking), power-mongering (Bernie Ecclestone), politics (oh, go on, you list them) and, by the gallon, sport: Tiger Woods, Wayne Rooney, Andy Murray. Men gaze with awe and admiration upon those who’ve grafted for their fortunes. But if women are asked whether they aspire to be gravel-voiced, 18-hour-working-day businesswoman Hilary Devey or the few hours here-and-there Judi Dench, they prefer the easier route any day: scant effort for maximum reward. Judi Dench . Helen Mirren . Emmeline Pankhurst . Dawn French . Joanna Lumley . And don’t tell me Devey doesn’t work ten times harder than Dench. As Katharine Hepburn famously pointed out, acting isn’t difficult: ‘Shirley Temple could do it when she was four.’ I’ve worked in repertory theatre and have produced feature-length TV drama and I promise that luvvies do less work, for fewer hours, then anyone else on the set. Nice work if you can get it and all that. But what does this mean in the long term? Most voters in the adults-only survey were mothers. Every day we hear of worried parents who despair of their otherwise clever, able, teenage girls whose ambition amounts to no more than: ‘I wanna be famous.’ Many of these modern mothers probably teach their girls some version of women’s rights. Most of them, no doubt, do a great job of persuading the next generation to revolt the moment they perceive themselves to be treated unequally. And I’ll bet they all do a nice line in indignation at the merest hint of a glass ceiling. Yet when these mothers rate the ‘inspirational’ Adele, Angelina Jolie or Rihanna more highly than Angela Merkel, Virginia Woolf or Eleanor Roosevelt, we might ask what influence they bring to bear on the daughters for whom they claim to want so much more. If mum is this much in thrall to effortless success and fairytale fortunes in make-believe worlds, what chance does even the smartest sixth-former have to resist the next time Simon Cowell brings his audition circus to town?","Actress Judi Dench topped poll of inspirational women .

"The Marine Corps general who leads America's Southern Command warned Tuesday that the U.S. could face an unprecedented flood of immigrants from the south if the Ebola virus epidemic hits Central America. 'If it breaks out, it's literally, ""Katie bar the door"",' Gen John Kelly told said during a public discussion at the National Defense University. 'And there will be mass migration into the United States.' 'They will run away from Ebola, or if they suspect they are infected, they will try to get to the United States for treatment.' The phrase 'Katie bar the door' refers to a panic in response to a coming threat. It likely originated with an 1894 poem about an Irish girl's family protecting their household from her drunkard husband. Kelly also warned on Tuesday that if the deadly disease should reach isolated, resource-poor countries in the Western Hemisphere like Haiti, it could devastate large populations before it's brought to heel. U.S. Marine Gen. John Kelly, commander of U.S. Southern Command, warned about the threat of Ebola coming from south of the US border . Coming to Texas? Gen. Kelly warned that an Ebola outbreak south of the border would bring a new swell of humanity to the US seeking refuge and medical treatment . Kelly, a four-star Marine Corps general (shown here in July), is concerned that the US won't be able to contain Ebola if it arrives via migrants instead of through airports . 'By the end of the year, there's supposed to be 1.4 million people infected with Ebola and 62 percent of them dying, according to the CDC,' he said. 'That's horrific. And there is no way we can keep Ebola [contained] in West Africa.' And once it makes the large-scale jump over the Atlantic Ocean, he worried aloud, 'much like West Africa, it will rage for a period of time.' Making matters potentially worse, Kelly warned that the same human trafficking networks responsible for bringing illegal immigrants northward through Mexico could unwittingly pass Ebola to the U.S. through their human cargo. He accompanied American embassy personnel to visit the border between Costa Rica and Nicaragua, he recalled. They saw a group of men 'waiting in line to pass into Nicaragua and then on their way north.' 'The embassy person walked over and asked who they were,' Kelly said, 'and they told him they were from Liberia and they had been on the road about a week.' 'They met up with the network in Trinidad and now they were on their way to the United States – illegally, of course.' Those men, he told the military audience, 'could have made it to New York City and still be within the incubation period for Ebola.' Ebola patients can carry the disease for a week or more before symptoms show and they become capable of easily transmitting the disease to others. The illness has killed 3,439 people in west Africa this year, according to the World Health Organization. The first American patient, a Liberian man who developed symptoms after reaching Texas on a trip to marry his girlfriend, died Wednesday morning. Illegal immigrant trafficking is already a booming business in Mexico despite the chance of being apprehended, and this could leave the US open to new sources of Ebola . First of many? Thomas Eric Duncan became the first US Ebola victim to perish from the disease on Wednesday morning . The Weekly Standard noted Wednesday that Gen. Kelly warned this year about the dangers associated with a loose American border to the south. Budgets cuts, he said in a spring congressional hearing, are 'severely degrading' his Pentagon task force's ability to stem the flow of illegal immigration. Nearly 75 per cent of traffickers, he said, are left unchallenged. 'I simply sit and watch it go by,' Kelly told lawmakers. 'All this corruption and violence is directly or indirectly due to the insatiable U.S.demand for drugs, particularly cocaine, heroin and now methamphetamines,” Kelly told the Defense One website in July, 'all of which are produced in Latin America and smuggled into the U.S. along an incredibly efficient network along which anything – hundreds of tons of drugs, people, terrorists, potentially weapons of mass destruction or children – can travel, so long as they can pay the fare.'","Gen.

"The second day of Royal Ascot got off to a stylish start with bold blooms, chic black and white and striking floral prints all challenging for dominance in the style stakes. But even the bright floral prints couldn't compete with the sea of spectacularly large hats that flooded Royal Ascot - with even the Queen plumping for a pretty mint green, purple and pale pink Angela Kelly creation, worn with a mint green crepe coat and a multi-coloured floral silk dress by Peter Enrione, and a diamond and emerald brooch. Once again the monarch looked on jaunty form as she arrived for the second day at the races, again accompanied by her eldest son Prince Charles and his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall. But not everyone was enjoying the day. Along with bookmakers who were forced to pay out on multiple colours for the second day in a row, racegoer Tracey Rose was left miserable after being ejected from the Royal Enclosure by Ascot's fashion police. Lovely: The Queen looked summery with a floral print lilac blouse beneath her green coat, while the Countess of Wessex chose a striking nude and cerise hat .

A furious Tracey Rose was evicted from the Royal Enclosure by the Ascot fashion police because of her too-short skirt . Racegoers traditionally have a punt on the colour of the hat she will wear on Ladies' Day, being staged tomorrow, when female racegoers wear even more outlandish hats and outfits then usual. Bookmaker Coral believes she will wear a blue hat and makes the colour its 3-1 favourite. But punters have been backing purple and its odds have fallen from 8-1 to 5-1. The 52-year-old milliner was left furious after her skirt was deemed too short and branded Ascot staff 'rude' and called the decision 'preposterous' as she left. Yesterday fellow milliner David Schilling was also thrown out for wearing unbecoming headgear after he tried to sneak in wearing a gargantuan floral wreath underneath his top hat. One who made a more delicate choice was the Duchess of Cornwall whose cream hat was pretty when teamed with . an on-trend pea green coat worn over a floral print tea dress. Her . husband meanwhile, looked dapper in a grey suit enlivened with a lilac . silk tie and waistcoat. The Countess of Wessex also put in an . appearance, watching the parade from the Royal Box and sporting a . wonderful nude and cerise straw hat, which was stylishly combined with a . knee-length wrap dress. Lady Helen Taylor, meanwhile, decided . that more was more when it came to colour and chose an ensemble that . combined a violet and yellow dress with a bright turquoise blue hat.

Others to appear on day one included veteran racing pundit, John McCririck, Gary Lineker's wife Danielle, who looked gorgeous in a pale pink lace dress and Bollywood megastar, Aishwarya Rai, who was elegant in monochrome. Like the royals and celebrities in attendance, the majority of racegoers chose elegant looks in line with Ascot's strict style rules, which include a ban on strapless dresses, sheer clothing and any form of fancy dress.

"A British cruise line company has been forced to divert two ships with thousands of passengers due to visit Argentina because of increasing tensions over the Falkland Islands. The Argentine government refused to guarantee P&O Cruises permission to dock in three ports as its two luxury liners were planning visiting the Falklands before Buenos Aires. This follows last week’s accusations by the British government that Argentina is ‘intimidating’ British cruise liners near the Falkland Islands. Refusing entry: P&O Cruises' Arcadia has been diverted from Argentina in the latest 'intimidating' move by the Argentine government blocking British cruise liners . Seven such incidents, where protestors or industrial action by militant unions have disrupted cruise liners bound for the Falklands, have now occurred in the past two months. It is understood that last month, the British Government ‘formally summoned’ the Argentine Ambassador Alicia Castro to protest against the incidents involving thousands of passengers since mid-November. The move by Argentina to effectively block the British liners comes after a year of tense negotiations between P&O's sister company Cunard and rulers of the South American country. Argentine officials are unhappy the luxury liners, Arcadia and Adonia, planned to visit the Falklands before docking in Buenos Aires, Puerto Madryn and Ushuaia, to refuel and collect food supplies. P&O had also arranged for 400 passengers, who pay up to £10,000 for tickets, join the cruise in Buenos Aires but and have now had to re-route them to Uruguay or offer a full refund. Word war: Last week, President Kirchner published an open letter, disguised as an advert in several newspapers including The Guardian, saying the Falklands were 'forcibly stripped' from Argentina . Hugo Swire, Foreign and Commonwealth . Affairs minister Hugo Swire said last week: We condemn unequivocally any . efforts to intimidate companies from pursuing their lawful business. ‘The . British government deeply regrets that elements in Argentina have . recently taken action aimed at disrupting cruise ships that visit the . Falklands.’ The Foreign Office last night said there had been around six incidents in recent weeks. They . include officials refusing permission entry Argentine ports or delaying . ships, masked militants attacking and ransacking offices of shipping . companies and scheduled cruise itineraries either altered, or abandoned, . to appease locals. Tensions . escalated between Britain and Argentina last week after Cristina . Kirchner, Argentina’s president, published an open letter to David . Cameron calling for the region to be returned to her Government’s . control. The letter, disguised as an advert published in several newspapers including The Guardian, Kirchner said the South Atlantic islands were 'forcibly stripped' from Argentina 180 years ago today 'in a blatant exercise of 19th-century colonialism'. The FCO has . accused Argentina of trying to strangle the islands’ economy, which . earns £10million from cruise ship tourism which employs around a quarter . of the working population. No entry: The cruise liners have been forced to divert their course away from Argentina's ports after their government found out they were planning to stop at the Falklands beforehand . Dear Dave: The letter by Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner addressed to Prime Minister David Cameron and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon about the Falkland Islands . Island . restaurant owner Hattie Kilmartin said: ‘Ours is one of many small . businesses being destroyed by Argentina's bullying tactics. They are . driving us out of business.’ A P&O spokesperson said: ‘On . numerous occasions over the last year ships associated with Britain and . flying the red ensign have not been permitted to call into Argentina or . have been severely delayed. ‘Over the past few months we have been . working with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and our local agents . to gain assurances from the Argentine government that our ships will be . allowed to call into their ports. ‘We have been unable to gain these assurances and the risk of being refused entry or being delayed is too high. Further trouble: A British flag is set on fire during a protest by Argentinian nationalists at the Buenos Aires cruise terminal last week . ‘As . a British cruise company we cannot allow ourselves to be the subject of . any political dispute or put our customers and crew into any situation . where their enjoyment may be compromised. ‘With . this in mind, we have had to take the difficult decision to remove all . Argentinian ports of call in 2013 from Arcadia and Adonia itineraries.’ The 2,106-passenger Arcadia and 710-passenger Adonio will still be calling at the Falkland Islands capital Port Stanley. An . inside source said: ‘We worked through the night preparing for the mail . drop. It could end up costing the company thousands if passengers . decide to take up the offer of a refund.’ A referendum of 3,000 residents is set to be held in March to get their approval of its status as a British overseas territory. Cunard spokesperson Michael Gallagher confirmed more ships are likely to be diverted, saying: ‘We will probably follow suit with P&O.’ America and Holland are also considering pulling their cruise liners out of Argentina.","P&O luxury liners planned to enter three ports, including Buenos Aires .

"Whizzing past high-rise buildings and dodging in and out of traffic, this is one man's view of his commute home. The exhilarating time-lapse video - filmed by cyclist Andrew Betsch - shows his view as he pedals through New York City. The sped-up footage shows him riding through the wide thoroughfares and leafy boulevards of the frenetic, busy and crowded metropolis. Just another day in New York: Pedestrians waiting  to cross the cycling lane . The faces of pedestrians are a blur in this stunning film of a bicycle journey from Midtown Manhattan to East Williamsburg, Brooklyn. New Yorker Betsch's two-wheeled travels take him through apartment block towers and skyscrapers, and past pedestrians and residents, all in a matter of seven minutes. The commuter sticks to the cycle lane, being careful to avoid pet-owners walking their dogs and the city’s residents, out on their daily chores. Empty streets: The usually busy and frenetic city seems eerie and quiet during the bike ride . Tree-line avenues: The viewer gets a glimpse of the city's more normal, down-to-earth side . There is hardly any sign of people as Mr Betsch starts his trip but as time goes on in the video, the roads start to get busier as traffic builds.

"Britain’s spy agency collected webcam images – including . sexually explicit material – from millions of innocent internet users. Agents at GCHQ intercepted streamed webcam chats from Yahoo . users and stored their images using a surveillance programme codenamed Optic . Nerve. In one six-month period in 2008, the intelligence agency . collected images from more than 1.8million Yahoo users around the world – . regardless of whether they were terror suspects or not. Claim: Cheltenham-based UK spy agency GCHQ has reportedly harvested webcam images - including sexually explicit material - of millions of internet users . Leaked top-secret documents reveal that up to 11 per cent of . the stored images contained ‘undesirable nudity’. The revelations are the latest from a batch of files . published by whistleblower Edward Snowden, the US defence worker who has . exposed shocking details of how spy agencies snoop on people around the world. Optic Nerve – which critics last night branded eerily . reminiscent of telescreens in George Orwell’s novel 1984 – was run with the aid . of the US National Security Agency. It was intended for use in experiments in . automated facial recognition to try to find terror suspects. Anger: Internet giant Yahoo reacted furiously to the claims, branding them a 'whole new level of violation' Rather than collecting webcam chats in their entirety, the . system saved one image every five minutes from the users’ feeds between 2008 . and 2010. 'Unfortunately … it would appear that a surprising number of people use webcam conversations to show intimate parts of their body to the other person' GCHQ . But documents leaked to The Guardian revealed that sexually explicit . pictures proved to be a problem for GCHQ. One comment from the agency read said: ‘Unfortunately … it . would appear that a surprising number of people use webcam conversations to . show intimate parts of their body to the other person. ‘Also, the fact that the Yahoo software allows more than one . person to view a webcam stream without necessarily sending a reciprocal stream . means that it appears sometimes to be used for broadcasting pornography.’ Internet giant Yahoo reacted furiously to the claims. A spokesman said: ‘We were not aware of, nor would we . condone, this reported activity. Ongoing: In its latest report on files leaked by US whistleblower Edward Snowden (pictured), the Guardian newspaper claims a surveillance programme collected still images of Yahoo webcam chats . ‘This report, if true, represents a whole new level of . violation of our users’ privacy that is completely unacceptable and we strongly . call on the world’s governments to reform surveillance law consistent with the . principles we outlined in December. 'This report, if true, represents a whole new level of violation of our users' privacy that is completely unacceptable and we strongly call on the world's governments to reform surveillance law consistent with the principles we outlined in December' Yahoo spokesman . 'We are committed to preserving our users’ trust and security and continue our efforts to expand encryption across all of  our services.’ Tory MP David Davis said: ‘This is, frankly, creepy. It is . perfectly proper for our intelligence agencies to use any and all means to . target people for whom there are reasonable grounds for suspicion of terrorism, . kidnapping and other serious crimes. ‘It is entirely improper to extend such intrusive . surveillance on a blanket scale to ordinary citizens.’ Allegation: GCHQ is understood to have secretly accessed fibre-optic cables carrying huge amounts of internet and communications data and shared the information with the NSA (whose offices in Maryland are pictured) Nick Pickles, director of civil liberties campaign group Big . Brother Watch, said: ‘This is an indiscriminate and intimate intrusion on . people’s privacy. 'Orwell's 1984 was supposed to be a warning, not an instruction manual' Nick Pickles, Big Brother Watch . 'Orwell’s 1984 was supposed to be a warning, not an . instruction manual.’ GCHQ declined to comment on the claims. Mr Snowden originally leaked information about the attempts . by government spy agencies to harvest private information from millions of . people. Earlier this year, MI5 director general Andrew Parker warned . that revealing details about GCHQ’s work was a ‘gift to terrorists’. Controversial CCTV cameras that target millions of motorists for parking fines are set to survive a promised Government cull, it emerged yesterday. The use of enforcement cameras outside schools and other sensitive areas could carry on despite a previous vow to ban them. Roads minister Robert Goodwill told a conference of parking chiefs that, when it came to scrapping all the cameras, ‘no decisions had been made’, and that they might still be used outside schools. That contradicted previous pledges to  outlaw all of the controversial cameras,  which can issue penalties of up to £130 a  time. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles  had previously vowed to ban them, accusing ‘bullying’ councils of fleecing drivers ‘on an industrial scale’. Councils rake in £30million a year from CCTV-led parking fines. A Government consultation on the issue also stated: ‘The Government intends to abolish use of CCTV cameras for parking enforcement.’ Mr Goodwill was speaking at a summit in London organised by the British Parking Association, which represents 700 councils and private sector operators.

"An obese 14-year-old is the youngest patient recorded to have undergone weight-loss surgery in England since 2007, parliamentary figures show. The youngster had one of the 45 procedures carried out on under 18s in the last six years. The procedures aim to reduce the size of the stomach or to make a person feel full by eating less food, according to the data. An obese 14-year-old is the youngest patient recorded to have undergone weight-loss surgery in England since 2007. The youngster had one of the 45 procedures carried out on under 18s (stock photo) Health minister Jane Ellison said there were 22 gastric bypasses, 18 gastric bands, two gastric bubble/balloon procedures and three stomach staples on children from April 2007 to March 2012. The number of cases where people were primarily admitted to hospital because of obesity and then required weight-loss surgery totalled 24,383 from April 2009 to March 2012 and increased year-on-year, the figures add. There were 115 procedures for obese 10 to 19-year-olds while the 40 to 49 age range recorded the highest total, with 8,821 in the three-year period. The figures also show people living in the more deprived 10 per cent to 20 per cent of the country are most likely to require surgery - 3,792 operations were carried out on these people compared with a 1,156 for patients in the least deprived parts of England. Former health minister Paul Burstow said: ‘These figures are the public health equivalent of the canary in the coal mine. ‘They are the most extreme end of an obesity epidemic that could undo the gains in life expectancy we have seen over the past century. ‘The solution cannot come from the NHS - it can only be found in our homes, our schools and our workplaces. ‘Teaching children about healthy eating and providing free school meals to all infant age children can help. It also needs the responsibility deal with the food industry to deliver.’ The number of cases where people were primarily admitted to hospital because of obesity and then required weight-loss surgery totalled 24,383 from April 2009 to March 2012 . Weight-loss surgery is used as a last resort to treat people who are dangerously obese, according to the NHS. The service says this type of surgery is only available on the NHS to treat people with potentially life-threatening obesity when other treatments, such as lifestyle changes, have not worked. Conservative MP Priti Patel uncovered the figures in a series of parliamentary questions. The data obtained by Ms Patel also shows there were 514 cases where zero to nine-year-olds were admitted to hospital mainly because of obesity from April 2009 to March 2012, with 1,601 admissions for 10 to 19-year-olds. Both groups have seen admissions - recorded as ‘finished admission episodes’ (FAEs) which denote the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one provider - decrease year-on-year, although total hospital admissions for patients with obesity-related issues increased in this period to 34,361. Women also substantially outnumbered men for the number of FAEs mainly linked to obesity. They accounted for 25,792 of the finished admissions from April 2009 to March 2012 compared with 8,563 for men. The figures do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person might have had more than one admission. The data was provided by the Health and Social Care Information Centre, which compiles data from more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England and from some independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by NHS England. The news comes just days after new NHS guidance was launched telling doctors not to blame patients for being fat. The guidelines urge GPs to be sensitive when dealing with obese patients, using a 'respectful' and non-judgemental tone. There were 514 cases where zero to nine-year-olds were admitted to hospital mainly because of obesity from April 2009 to March 2012 . With Britain in the grip of an obesity epidemic costing the NHS £5billion a year, Nice called on doctors, GPs and other health workers, as well as those who run lifestyle weight-loss programmes, to monitor their tone and not add to the stigma of being fat. Last year it emerged that several NHS Trusts are refusing to give certain treatments to fat patients unless they lose weight. Patients have been denied procedures such as hip and knee replacements and IVF, unless they agree to make radical changes to their lifestyle. The Nice guidance also provides instructions for Public Health England, which is responsible for health campaigns. It says it should ‘be aware of the effort needed to lose weight and avoid further weight gain and the stigma adults who are overweight or obese may feel or experience’. It adds: ‘Ensure the tone and content of all communications or dialogue is respectful and non-blaming. The terminology used to describe the person’s condition should respect individual preferences.’ GPs and those running weight management programmes for the NHS have also been told to ensure patients have a realistic view of what to expect when losing weight, telling them there is no ‘magic bullet’.","From 2007 to 2012, 22 gastric bypasses, 18 gastric bands, two gastric bubble procedures and three stomach staples were carried out on children .

"Victim: Delfino Mora, 62, was found unconscious in an alley in Chicago last Tuesday. He died in hospital the next day as a result of blunt head trauma . Three teenagers were playing a game called 'Pick'em out and Knock'em dead' when they beat a father of twelve to death then posted the footage on Facebook, prosecutors said today. Delfino Mora was found unconscious in an alley in Chicago, Illinois, last Tuesday morning. He died in hospital the next day as a result of blunt head trauma. Malik Jones, 16, Nicholas Ayala, 17, and Anthony Malcolm, 18, have each been charged with first-degree murder and robbery. Jones had spotted Mr Mora and decided to attack him, State Attorney Terry Clancy told a bail hearing today. The teen is said to have told his friends: ' 'I think I'm gonna knock out this ******' and started recording on his phone. Police claim that Ayala and Malcolm took turns using a mobile phone to record the fatal assault on Mr Mora, who didn't have full use of his right arm after a workplace accident 15 years ago. The footage was then uploaded to Jones' Facebook account, it is claimed. Jones, a suspected gang member who is being charged as an adult, appeared in court yesterday and was ordered to be held without bail. His preliminary hearing is scheduled for later today. While prosecutors did not identify his two accomplices by name, they detailed how the attack allegedly took place. Jones is said to have have handed his . phone to his co-defendants and then approached Mr Mora in an alley in . the Des Plaines area of the city at around 5am last Tuesday. He ordered his victim to empty his pockets and then punched him in the jaw, prosecutors said. Mr Mora fell and hit his head on concrete. Jones told police he had hit Mr Mora, who is originally from Mexico, the court was told. A passer-by found Mr Mora with blood on his face and vomit next to his head about three hours later. Arrested: Nicholas Ayala, 17 (left), and Anthony Malcolm, 18 (right), have been charged with first-degree murder and robbery alongside Malik Jones, 16 . Grieving: Mr Mora's widow Maria Carmen Mora (centre) and three of his 12 children . The attack was recorded on Jones' mobile phone and the footage was placed on his Facebook account. A witness who knows Jones watched the video and passed it on. It eventually reached a co-worker of Mr Mora's son, who called the police. Jones was arrested on Saturday, while Ayala and Malcolm were apprehended yesterday and are due in court for an initial hearing later today. Mr Mora's youngest child Angelica, 17, told the Chicago Tribune: 'It feels to us like they're making fun of my dad because he couldn't defend himself. 'They think posting a violent video makes them tough. It's like they want to get famous.' Mr Mora was father to six girls and six boys, who range in age from 17 to 40, and was also a grandfather. The family is planning to take his body back to Mexico to be buried later this week.","Delfino Mora was found unconscious in an alley in Chicago, Illinois, last Tuesday .

"Accused: Tamerlan Tsarnaev did kill his 'only American friend' and two others in a drug deal gone wrong according to court documents filed by federal prosecutors regarding the trial of his younger brother in Massachusetts today . Boston bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev did participate in a brutal triple murder 16 months before the deadly marathon attack according to court records filed on Tuesday. Brendan Mess, described as Tsarnaev's 'only American friend', Raphael Teken and Erik Weissman were murdered at their home  in Waltham, Massachusetts on the 10th anniversary of 9/11. Their bodies were found covered in . marijuana in the apartment and at the time authorities revealed their . throats had been slit with a knife or ice pick and around $5,000 was left at the . scene. The startling disclosure was made by federal prosecutors who are trying to prevent his younger brother's legal team from obtaining documents concerning the killing of the three men on September 11, 2011. It is the first official statement that links the now-dead elder Tsarnaev to the unsolved crime and raises questions about the death in May of his friend Ibragim Todashev, who allegedly confessed his and Tsarnaev's involvement to FBI agents before he was shot dead after charging them. 'According to Tsarnaev's friend Ibragim Todashev, Tamerlan Tsarnaev participated in the Waltham triple homicide,' prosecutors wrote in a motion filed on Monday according to MyFox Boston. However, it has not been made clear when Todashev confessed and his family have strenuously denied his involvement. The revelation that authorities are now sure that Tsarnaev was a murderer before he killed three and injured hundreds at the finishing line of the Boston Marathon in April came as prosecutors tried to block the efforts of the legal team of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. Victim: Brendan Mess was one of three victims in a triple slaying that Todashev allegedly confessed to police that he and Tsarnaev had committed in September 2011 . His defense team want all the documents pertaining to the 2011 killings handed over to them and made admissible in court. While this has no legal bearing on the terror charges that the 20-year-old suspect faces, the defense team is keen to prove that Dzhokhar was frightened or in thrall to his over-powering elder brother. This would help fight against a possible recommendation against the death penalty. In turn, prosecutors have argued the documents hold little value to the younger Tsarnaev's defense and handing over the files would jeopardise the Middlesex District Attorney's ongoing and 'active' investigation into the Waltham murders. A judge is yet to rule on the decision. However, the assertion that Tamerlan Tsarnaev was definitely involved in the gruesome murders raises more questions about the death of Todashev in May, who was shot and killed by an FBI agent in his own Orlando apartment. He was being interviewed by federal agents and Massachusetts State Police about the Waltham murders and unconfirmed media reports from the time of the killings stated that he implicated himself and Tsarnaev. He then charged the law enforcement officials who shot him dead, even though he was unarmed. He allegedly become violent when police quizzed him over links to Tamerlan Tsarnaev and the unsolved 2011 triple homicide. Over two years after the triple murder at 12 Harding Avenue in Waltham, Massachusetts, investigators said for the first time today that Tamerlan Tsarnaev did in fact participate in the killings . In Sept. 2011, Brendan Mess, described as Tsarnaev's 'only American friend', Raphael Teken and Erik Weissman were murdered on September 11, 2011 at their home . It was claimed at the time that authorities were pressuring Todashev to make a full confession to the murders while they questioned him at his Orlando home. It is known Tamerlan Tsarnaev was close friends with one of the victims, Mess, and the FBI have made statements previous to today's revelations that they were looking into whether he was one of the killers. Normal life: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and a friend. The 19-year-old is set to stand trial for the Boston bombing . Law enforcement sources familiar with shooting in May told NBC that Todashev and Tsarnaev carried out the 2011 killings when a drug deal turned violent. The suspects didn't want the three victims to be able to identify them, so they slit their throats, according to the network. Deceased: Ibragim Todashev was fatally shot by an FBI agent. Initial reports said he had a knife but that was not true . DNA evidence apparently led them to Todashev and his Orlando apartment not far from Universal Studios on May 22. He had been questioned for some hours before he allegedly flipped and the shooting came as one agent stepped out of the room, leaving Todashev alone with one officer, the New York Post said at the time. In April, when asked if Tamerlan's implication in the Boston marathon bombings would make them reopen the case, a spokesman for the District Attorney's office was guarded. 'The 2011 triple homicide is an extremely important case for us and remains an active and open investigation.' 'Any . information that comes forward as a result of the investigation into . Tamerlan Tsnaraev and the Boston bombings will be immediately reviewed . and pursued.' Initially . police said two other people had been there on the day and they were . looking to question them. Investigators at the time said the murders were 'targeted and not a random act of violence.' Middlesex District Attorney Gerard Leone . issued a statement soon after the murders saying, 'based on the present . state of the investigation, it is believed that the victims knew the . assailant or assailants, and the attacks were not random.'","Startling revelation is the first time that federal authorities have officially implicated Tamerlan Tsarnaev in the gruesome 2011 killings .

"This is the miracle baby who saved his mother’s life - by destroying a cancerous tumour that was growing in her womb. Doctors feared for Nicola Weller’s life when they discovered a tumour in her womb after she had complained about a swelling under her ribs. She was referred for a hospital scan 12 weeks later prior to an operation to remove it, but when they carried out the scan, doctors made the most startling discovery. Nicola Weller's life was saved by her son Brandon as the pregnancy hormones in her body when she was carrying him destroyed a cancerous tumour in her womb . Mrs Weller, 29, was unknowingly seven weeks pregnant - despite using the contraceptive coil - and the pregnancy hormones had causes the tumour to disintegrate. Mrs Weller, a recruitment specialist, said: ‘It was absolutely unbelievable. I hadn’t planned to get pregnant and I’d had the contraceptive coil fitted. ‘So getting pregnant was a miracle in itself - but to find that my unborn baby had caused this tumour to disappear was a further miracle. All that was left on the scan was a few blobs of blood floating around. There was no other sign of it. ‘My baby ended up saving my life. Without him I may not have been here today.’ Mrs Weller first discovered the swelling under her rib in September 2009. She went to see her GP who referred her to Bridport Community Hospital in Dorset for a scan. Doctors told her there was a tumour growing around her womb and she needed an operation to remove it. Mrs Weller, 29, went to hospital to have the tumour removed but before the operation she had a scan which revealed that she was seven weeks pregnant and the tumour had disappeared . Mrs Weller, who has a daughter Alisha, eight, said: ‘I was absolutely devastated. My world just fell apart. My daughter was four years old, and I was being told that I was facing cancer. It was terrifying to think that I may leave her without a mum.’ In January 2010 she went to Dorset County Hospital to have the tumour removed, but before she was taken down for her operation, she had another scan. And it was then that the doctors made a remarkable discovery. She said: ‘I waited as the nurse tried to locate the tumour on the scanner, and then she suddenly went out the room. She came back in a few minutes later with another three radiologists.’ The medical team then broke the news to her that the tumour had disappeared. She said: ‘I couldn’t take it in. I’d . come into hospital for an operation to remove the tumour, yet now I was . being told that it had gone. Mrs Weller required no further treatment for the cancer and Brandon was born in September 2010 none the worse for his experience . ‘The doctors couldn’t believe it either. Everyone was amazed. One radiologist said he’d never seen it before. The second one said he’d seen one case, after medication, and the other said he’d seen it once before, where pregnancy hormones had caused a tumour to disappear.’ They then broke the news to Mrs Weller that she was seven weeks pregnant. The pregnancy hormones had caused her tumour to disappear. She said: ‘I was stunned to find out I was expecting a baby - but even more stunned to hear that this baby had caused my tumour to disappear. It was like he had been sent from above to save my life.’ The doctors carried out a biopsy on the small residue that was left from the tumour and found that it was in the early stages of cancer. She added: ‘We’ve had family members who have battled with cancer and there hasn’t been a happy ending. To me, cancer has always meant chemotherapy treatment and losing people you love. It never occurred to me that a tumour could literally disappear overnight.’ Doctors at Dorset County Hospital said they had only once before seen a womb tumour be destroyed by pregnancy hormones. There is still no sign of the tumour returning . Mrs Weller was monitored closely during her pregnancy and she was scanned regularly in case the tumour did come back. Her pregnancy went smoothly and her baby son Brandon arrived in September 2010, weighing a healthy 7Ib 8oz. Mrs Weller, who lives with husband Russell, 29, who runs a scaffolding company, in Bridport, Dorset, said: ‘It was a relief when he was born, and it was lovely to meet and hold my wonderful son who had saved me. He was delivered with his right arm pointing forwards so we nicknamed him Superman. ‘And he really is a Superman, after saving my life.’ So far there has been no sign of the tumour returning, and Mrs Weller is enjoying on being a mum. She said: ‘I hadn’t planned another baby, but I’m so glad I did. The tumour was in the early stages of cancer, so it was life-threatening. I’ve never heard of a baby destroying a tumour before - but I’m very glad that Brandon did. ‘One day when he’s old enough to understand I’ll tell him how he saved his mummy’s life. Alisha understands what has happened and she’s very grateful to him too. She dotes on her little brother.’","Nicola Weller went to hospital for surgery to remove a tumour from her womb - before she had the operation a scan revealed she was pregnant .

"Chris Froome leads a British team full of options for the Road World Championships in Spain later this month. Froome, the 2013 Tour de France winner and runner-up in the Vuelta a Espana which finished on Sunday, is joined in the nine-man squad by Commonwealth Games champion Geraint Thomas, British champion Pete Kennaugh and David Millar, who will be racing for the final time in a Great Britain jersey before retiring at the end of the season. Also in the squad for the men's road race on September 28, the final day of the World Championships in Ponferrada, are Steve Cummings, Luke Rowe, the Yates twins Simon and Adam and Ben Swift, who is another who could be a protected rider for if the race ends in a sprint. Chris Froome will lead the British line-up for the Road World Championships in Spain later this month . Sir Bradley Wiggins, as expected, is named only for the time-trial, which takes place on September 24, alongside Commonwealth Games champion Alex Dowsett. It means Wiggins, the 2012 Tour de France winner, and Froome will not have raced together since last year's World Championships in Florence, when not a single Briton finished in a desperate showing. The pair have not raced in the same Team Sky squad since the Tour of Oman in February 2013 amid suggestions of a feud dating to the 2012 Tour. Wiggins, who is currently negotiating a new deal with Team Sky, is turning his attentions to the track for the Rio de Janeiro Olympics. Sir Dave Brailsford, the Team Sky principal who resigned as British Cycling performance director in April, is overseeing the squad as British Cycling technical director Shane Sutton concentrates on the build-up to the track season. Sir Bradley Wiggins has been named only for the time-trial for the Road World Championships in Spain . Lizzie Armitstead leads the six-rider women's squad, which also includes two-time junior world champion Lucy Garner. Hannah Barnes, Anna Christian and mountain bike riders Annie Last and Alice Barnes complete the line-up. Hannah and Alice Barnes are sisters. There is no entrant in the women's time-trial following Emma Pooley's retirement as it is not believed anyone has medal potential. Sutton said: 'I'm pleased with the teams we've selected for the UCI Road World Championships. Across the board, we have some real podium contenders. 'Sir Brad showed great form at the Tour of Britain this year, winning the time-trial stage, and of course Alex did a fantastic ride to win the time trial at the Commonwealth Games so it will be interesting to see how they get on. 'Fellow Commonwealth Games champion Lizzie Armitstead has a great team around her including two mountain bikers who should be able to support her on the reasonably hilly course. 'For the men's road race, Chris proved he's in good shape by coming second at the Vuelta and I'm pleased David Millar will be leading the team in his last outing in Great Britain kit.' - Men's elite road race: Steve Cummings, Chris Froome, Pete Kennaugh, David Millar, Luke Rowe, Ben Swift, Geraint Thomas, Adam Yates, Simon Yates. - Men's elite time-trial: Alex Dowsett, Sir Bradley Wiggins. - Women's elite road race: Lizzie Armitstead, Alice Barnes, Hannah Barnes, Anna Christian, Lucy Garner, Annie Last.","The 2013 Tour de France winner is part of the British set-up for the Road World Championships in Spain .

"Had this been the Premier League, everyone would have packed up at 0-0 with Tim Howard deservedly hailed a hero. But the American’s impassable effort had merely granted his Belgian opponents an additional 30 minutes to breach his target – and that they did, twice. Howard, though, was above criticism, and his numbers told their own story. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Obama get stuck in and start chanting during World Cup match .

It was the best performance from an American goalkeeper since Sylvester Stallone’s exploits in the 1981 film Escape to Victory. And Howard’s display belonged on the big screen. Only there was to be no fairytale ending, Belgium emerging 2-1 victors after another pulsating affair at these finals. But it mattered not, the 35-year-old had etched his name in the history books. Seventeen of Belgium’s 39 shots had found the target, only the extra-time efforts of Kevin De Bruyne and Romelu Lukaku managing to evade Howard; by this juncture, however, his rearguard had tired and the netminder was exposed. Divock Origi had been thwarted three times, Eden Hazard twice, even defender Jan Vertonghen had been denied on a couple of occasions. He had improvised to use his feet, chest and knees. Howard’s heat map serves to highlight his red-hot display. He even swept up on the edge of his penalty area – Manuel Neuer style – when called upon.

"Less than two weeks after being stabbed 19-times by two so-called friends and left for dead in the wild woods of Wisconsin, the 12-year-old 'Slender Man' attack victim is back home. Released from hospital on Friday, the young girl who is not being identified because of her age has been recuperating in her bedroom watching episodes of Full House. Stabbed on May 31, the girl is trying to understand her betrayal and brutal attempted murder by Morgan Geyser and Anissa Weier, both 12, who planned to kill her as an offering to the mythical figure of Slender Man. Scroll Down for Video . Home: The 12-year-old girl stabbed 19 times and left for dead as an offering to the mythic Slender Man is back home with her family recuperating . 'She’s a very big cat lover,' said family friend Dana Hoffman to ABC News. 'She’s got two cats at home, and you know, it’s just trying to re-establish what that new normal looks like and surround her with things that are familiar.' The young girl was discovered by a passing cyclist after managing to crawl to a road after being stabbed so badly by Weier and Geyser that they thought she would die in the pool of blood they left her in. Another family friend, Krista Natarelli, said the girl's resilience is inspiring. Recovery: Family friend Dana Hoffman told ABC News that the 12-year-old girl is watching episodes of Full House and spending time with her cats . 'She knew that she wanted to live and she was going to do everything she could to make that happen,' Natarelli said to ABC News. 'She is going to survive this,' she said. 'People can overcome horrible things. She is a beacon of life for all of us.' On Wednesday, her condition improved from 'critical but stable' to 'fair', a spokesman at Waukesha Memorial Hospital confirmed. Her parents updated friends, families and supporters on a fundraising page set up to help cover their medical bills. In the message, they wrote that their daughter has been walking around the hospital with the help of her father and resting by watching TV in a wheelchair. Charged as adults: Morgan Geyser (left) and . Anissa Weier (right), both 12,  face 65 years in prison after admitting . to police that they stabbed the classmate in hopes of joining the cult of the 'Slender Man' They say they've been 'overwhelmed with the amount of love and support' they've received, but ask everyone to respect their daughter's privacy by not naming her in social media posts or to the press. 'Our little girl is a fighter and is making strides of improvement each and every day. We appreciate your patience, love and support as we too are stunned and saddened by this tragedy,' they wrote. As of Thursday afternoon, the fund had raised more than $40,000 of its $250,000 goal. Geyser and Weier have since been charged as adults on counts of first-degree intentional homicide, and police say they had been plotting the crime for month. Both suspects told police they tried to kill their friend because of their obsession with Slender Man, a character they discovered on a website called Creepypasta Wiki, which is devoted to horror stories. In an official police report Weier said Slender Man is the ‘leader’ of Creepypasta, and she needed to kill to show their loyalty. The Slender Man is a prevalent internet myth . that has been a viral sensation since it emerged online in 2009. On the left, a depiction of Slender Man and on the right, a drawing . Geyser drew of 'Slender' that her dad proudly posted on Instagram . She explained Geyser told her they needed slaughter their friend in order to become ‘proxies’ of Slender Man and gain access to his mansion, which they believed was located inside northern Wisconsin's Nicolet National Forest. They planned to kill the victim and then walk to the mansion. Weier said the victim was so badly injured she couldn't breathe, see or walk and that they left her lying on the ground in a pool of blood. But the fighter pushed on, and crawled out of the woods to safety where she waved down passing bicyclist Greg Steinberg. On Wednesday, audio of Steinberg's 911 call was released, in which he can be heard comforting the 12-year-old victim while paramedics rushed to the scene. Steinberg told the dispatcher that the girl had been stabbed, but was conscious. 'Yes, she's breathing,' he told the operator. 'She says she can take shallow breaths. She's alert.' Suspects Geyser and Weier were arrested several hours later at a furniture store where police found Weier had a five-inch blade in her backpack. If convicted as adults, the girls face up to 65 years in prison.","Girl stabbed 19-times and left for dead by her two 12-year-old classmates is back home after being released from hospital .

"The dress worn by Elizabeth Taylor at her first wedding is to be auctioned by Christie's in London, and is expected to fetch up to £50,000. Taylor wore the iconic gown, made by costume designer Helen Rose, for her 1950 wedding to Conrad 'Nicky' Hilton Jr, when she was just 18 years old. The original waist measured 20 inches, but it has since been taken out to a slightly more generous 22. The original waist of the Helen Rose dress Taylor wore to marry Hilton, left, measured 20 inches, but it has since been taken out to a slightly more generous 22, right . The intricately designed dress, decorated with pearls, took 15 people up to three months to create . At this time, 18-year-old Elizabeth was already a veteran actress and celebrated star and was just a year away from her Oscar-nominated performance in the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) 1951 film A Place in the Sun. The Hollywood 'wedding of weddings' was the social event of the year. MGM boasted that 'more stars than there are in heaven' attended, with the 700 guests representing the A-list of classic Hollywood, including Greer Garson, Gene Kelly, Ginger Rogers, Fred Astaire, Esther Williams and Van Johnson. Guests also included Taylor's co-stars from Father of the Bride (1950) Spencer Tracy and Joan Bennett, a film which MGM marketed and skillfully scheduled for release mere weeks after the wedding. Elizabeth Taylor and Conrad Hilton eat cake at their 1950 wedding... and were divorced just eight months later . The beautiful dress was itself a gift from MGM to the teenage bride, and it was so revered that photographs of it have appeared all over the world; from newspapers and tabloids to LIFE magazine. With its twenty five yards of shell-white satin embellished with bugle beads and seed pearls, trailed by a fifteen-yards of satin train, it is exactly the kind of elegant design for which Helen Rose was known. Everything about this gown was custom-designed with Elizabeth Taylor's voluptuous figure in mind; a built-in corset allowed the dress to be tightly cinched in at the waist and the veil's ten yards of shimmering silk net was carefully considered and attached to a pearl-covered Juliet cap in order to float around the bride. The project was so extensive and was such a priority at MGM that more than fifteen people worked full-time for between two and three months straight on it. Everything about this gown was custom-designed with Elizabeth Taylor's voluptuous figure in mind; from the built-in corset to the veil's ten yards of shimmering silk net . Helen Rose was known for always achieving Louis B. Mayer's order to 'just make them look beautiful' and for treating everyone with great respect. She had extremely good relationships with all of her colleagues and clients and often designed their off-screen wardrobes, frequently including their wedding gowns. Perhaps her most famous was Grace Kelly's when she became the Princess of Monaco, a design that recently inspired the Duchess of Cambridge‟s wedding dress designed by Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen. Few wedding dresses have as deep a historical connection to both film and fashion as this; it‟s an example of a legendary designer and star working together in perfect harmony and the result is something that has made a lasting impact on fashion. Taylor and Hilton were divorced just eight months after their wedding.","Taylor wore gown to marry Conrad 'Nicky' Hilton Jnr in 1950 .

"A neighbor of the 23-year-old Quincy man who is facing federal charges for his alleged connection with the Boston Marathon bombings said she heard loud explosions in the vicinity of the young man's house one week before the attack last year. Khairullozhon Matanov was arrested Friday and charged with one count of destroying, altering, and falsifying records, documents, and tangible objects in a federal investigation, and three counts of making materially false, fictitious, and fraudulent statements in a federal terrorism investigation. He had ties to the alleged bombing suspects, brothers Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev. The Massachusetts cab driver allegedly went out for dinner with the pair hours after the attack on April 15, 2013. Quincy resident Elizabeth Feitelberg said she heard two explosions in her neighborhood in March and April of last year, one so powerful it shook her house. Arrest: Khairullozhon Matanov is facing charges of obstructing a terrorism investigation after allegedly deleting files from his computer . Scene: The apartment building where Khairullozhon Matanov, 23, was arrested shortly after 5 a.m., Friday, May 30, 2014, in Quincy, Mass. Matanov, a friend of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing suspectss, faces federal charges he destroyed, altered and falsified records, and made false statements to obstruct the investigation into the bombings . Concerned resident:  Elizabeth Feitelberg, a neighbor of Khairullozhon Matanov in Quincy, Massachusetts, said she heard two explosions in her neighbor in March and April of last year, right before the Boston Marathon bombings . The photographer reported both incidents to police, but only realized a possible connection to the bombings following the recent arrest of Matanov, who lives nearby. 'I thought it's probably not a coincidence if the people that did what they did in Boston wanted to practice or do stuff ahead of time,' she told My Fox Boston. Feitelberg’s husband told FOX 25 that he remembers what he called a loud helicopter or planes flying over the neighborhood last year. A source told the Patriot Ledger that the FBI was using a drone-like plane to track Matanov's movements. Police do not believe Matanov was directly linked to the bombings or that he had prior knowledge about them. He has lived in the U.S. since 2010, when he arrived on a student visa. He was later granted permission to stay because of unrest in his home country. At his court hearing on Friday, hours after police raided his apartment, Matanov wore a Levi's T-shirt and jeans as he entered no plea. According to the indictment, seen by the Boston Globe, Matanov had been friends with Tamerlan Tsarnaev, and allegedly joined him in activities such as 'discussing religious topics and hiking . up a New Hampshire mountain in order to train like, and praise, the ""mujahideen"" [Islamic guerrillas]'. After dining with the brothers a few hours after two devices had been detonated near the finish line of the marathon, in an attack that killed three and injured 260 others, Matanov appeared to show support for the bombings. Nervous: An attorney for Matanov, who moved to the U.S. from Krygzstan in 2010, says his client is frightened by the charges . Suspects: Tamerlan, right, and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, left, seen on security footage on the day of the attack. That night, they met Matanov for dinner . Arrest: Matanov was handcuffed and led away from this Quincy apartment at about 5.30am Friday . He allegedly told a witness the attack 'could have had a just reason, such as being done in the name of Islam,' the indictment said. Cab driver Khairullozhon Matanov was friends with the Tsarnaev brothers before the Boston Marathon bombing. He had joined older brother Tamerlan for a hike where they allegedly praised mujahideen. On April 15, 2013, just 42 minutes after two bombs were detonated near the finish line of the marathon, Matanov called the brothers to invite them out for dinner. An indictment claims that as a manhunt for the suspects - at this point still unidentified - got underway, Matanov spoke to the brothers on a cell phone. On April 17, the 23-year-old from Krygyzstan visited Tamerlan at his home. He first realized they were suspects when police released pictures of the brothers. On April 18, Matanov allegedly tried to call Dzhokhar's cellphone. No one answered. After the brothers were named as suspects, Matanov allegedly deleted 902 video files and 377 document files from his computer. He allegedly asked two people to take cell phones from him. Early on in the investigation, Matanov was interviewed voluntarily by police. On May 30, 2014, he was arrested at his apartment. It added that he claimed 'he would support the bombings if the reason were just or the attack had been done by the Taliban, and the victims had gone to paradise'. It was only days later that he started to express sympathy for the victims, and say the bombings might have been wrong. During this time he allegedly saw the brothers, suspected of being behind the attacks, a couple of times. He allegedly tried to contact both Tamerlan and Dzhokhar twice on a cellphone, and saw Tamerlan in person on two occasions, including at the suspect's home on April 17. According to the indictment, Matanov didn't realize his friends had been connected with the bombing until the FBI released pictures of them on April 18. He allegedly tried to contact the brothers one last time, on the morning of April 19, when he called Dzhokhar's cellphone. No one answered. At that point, Dzhokar was the focus of a massive manhunt, and his brother had already been shot dead by police. After the brothers were named as the suspects, Matanov is accused of making false statements to investigators, and deleting files from his computer of 'violent content or calls to violence'. He also allegedly tried to get two people to take cell phones from him, so they wouldn't be found when the FBI searched his apartment. By deleting the files, the indictment says Matanov: 'Obstructed the FBI’s determination . of his internet activity ... and the extent to which he shared the . suspected bombers’ philosophical justification for violence, among other . topics of interest'. Connection: Brothers Tamerlan, left, and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, right, knew Matanov . Refuge: After arriving in the U.S. on a student visa, Matanov was given residency because of unrest in his home country . Accusations: Matanov could face a lengthy prison term if he is found guilty of obstructing the investigation . Although he was interviewed voluntarily by a detective, Matanov allegedly made false statements to hide the extent of his friendship with the brothers. Matanov, who has no family in the U.S., was described as being 'nervous and frightened' by his defense attorney, Ed Hayden. 'He had no intent to mislead the FBI and, from what I can see, whatever he did, didn’t impede the investigation,' Hayden told the Boston Globe. Matanov has been charged with one count of destroying altering and falsifying records and documents, and three counts of making a false statement in a federal terrorism investigation. Deadly: Runners head towards the finish line of the Boston Marathon as an explosion erupts on April 15, 2013 . Forensic: Investigators survey the site of a bomb blast on Boylston Street a day after two explosions hit the Boston Marathon in Boston, Massachusetts on April 16, 2013 . If found guilty, the cab driver could face up to 20 years in prison for the first charge, and up to eight years for each of the three false statement charges. He is being held without bail until a hearing, scheduled to be held on Wednesday. Matanov is the fifth person to face charges surrounding the bombings. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is charged with carrying out the attack, and three of his university friends are facing charges over the alleged removal of a backpack and laptop from his dorm room.

"It is an elegant drawing room whose windows allow the early morning light to flood in, bathing its occupants and furniture in a flattering glow. Little wonder then, that The Morning Room at Clarence House is a favourite place of Prince Charles and his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, to entertain distinguished visitors. On Wednesday, it was Camilla’s turn to host Her Royal Highness Princess Laurentien of the Netherlands, who has been Chair of the European Union High Level Group of Experts on Literacy, which published a report into ways of promoting literacy across Europe. Lap of luxury: 1. Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, and Princess Laurentien of the Netherlands  are sitting on much admired Thomas Chippendale giltwood sofa, part of a suite of seat furniture by the famous designer comprising two sofas and two bergeres. Dating from about 1773, it may have been commissioned by George III’s brother, the Duke of Gloucester. 2. The porcelain in the cabinets behind them is largely comprised of a group of red-anchor Chelsea botanical porcelain , dating back to 1752-6, acquired by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother over a long period beginning in 1947. 3. Charles’s adored grandmother, the previous chatelaine of Clarence House, looms heavily in the room (although that is of little surprise, as the prince was closer to her than even his own mother). The painting to the right of the mantelpiece is a study for the Portrait of Queen Elizabeth as Royal Bencher of the Middle Temple by Sir James Gunn, 1945. 4. The small portrait on the mantelpiece is of the then Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, by Mabel Hankey, dating back to 1908. 5. There is another personal memento in the picture in the form of a photograph in a frame of The Prince of Wales and Prince Harry in South Africa 1997. Charles took his youngest son to the country in his half-term holiday of October that year following the tragic death of his mother just weeks earlier. 6. Other priceless antiques, either owned personally by the Royal Family or loaned by the Royal Collection, include the carved, painted and giltwood pedestals, with lights on either side of the sofa, which are mid-18th century in origin. 7. To the left of the mantelpiece is Sir Noel Coward’s painting entitled ‘Sortie de l’Eglise, Jamaique, 1961.’ 8. The bust is King George VI, the Queen’s father. 9. There is also a pair of cockerels which belonged to Queen Mary, inherited by Queen Elizabeth in 1953. The two first met in Amsterdam for the . Inauguration of King Willem-Alexander in April this year and discovered . their shared a passion for promoting literacy. The . picture of the two women together provides a fascinating insight into . the interior at Clarence House, which is currently the official . residence of Prince Charles and his wife. It . was also the London home of the present Queen, then Princess Elizabeth, . and her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, following their marriage in . 1947. Charles lives there as a toddler between the ages of one and . three. Elegance: Clarance House, pictured, is currently the official residence of Prince Charles and his wife Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall. The house also boasts stunning formal gardens which run the length of the front . The Queen Mother . moved in following her daughter’s Coronation in 1953, until her death in . 2002. Her grandson moved back in on August 4 2003, the anniversary of . her birth. The house itself, . often described as looking like a wedding cake, was built between 1825 . and 1827 to the designs of John Nash for Prince William Henry, Duke of . Clarence. He lived there as King William 1V from 1830 until 1837. The . Morning Room was originally the Breakfast Room in Nash’s original . design for the Duke of Clarence. Much later Queen Elizabeth changed the . decorative scheme and introduced the chimneypiece. The . building itself was, and still is, very much regarded as a ‘home’ by . all those who have been lucky to live within its elegant walls.","Photo of Duchess of Cornwall meeting Princess Laurentien of the Netherlands gave glimpse inside Clarence House .

"A half-century-old section of a U.S. Air Force base in Texas has been transformed into a holding and processing center for thousands of children illegally crossing the border from Central and South America without adults. Leaked photos from the base, which were obtained by the Breitbart.com news blog show hundreds of children holed up in crowded concrete rooms, many of them sleeping on the bare floor without blankets or pillows. Among those children are Jose Maquez Soto, 12, who came from Honduras to the United States and now rests on a bunk at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio under a hand-drawn flag of his native country and a message cheering the Honduran squad in the upcoming soccer World Cup. Overflowing: The shelter at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas can no longer accommodate large numbers of children and mothers traveling with their kids, forcing the federal government to open more facilities and move many to Nogales for processing . Hundreds of immigrants believed to be in the country illegally from Central America and Mexico being held in crowded concrete rooms similar to a jail cell . Many of the children appear to be teenagers but some clearly are younger . Lackland has become a temporary shelter for youths caught crossing the border illegally and alone . America has been left astounded by the shocking conditions these children have been kept in - conditions so dire that border control agents fear the spread of disease . About 850 that were being housed at the facility have been released to a vetted family member or a sponsor . Jose is one of the 60,000 'unaccompanied minors' - children under 18 - that the Obama administration estimates will enter the United States illegally this year. It projects that number to grow to nearly 130,000 next year, creating what the White House describes as an 'urgent humanitarian situation'. Nearly 1,000 of the minors at a time are being sheltered at a facility built about 50 years ago to house new recruits for basic training. The boys and girls will pass along corridors with faded Air Force pictures and new signs written in Spanish that point the way to the dining hall and bathrooms. Since the facility opened three weeks ago, 1,820 children have passed through the center. About 850 have been released to a vetted family member or a sponsor, said U.S. Department of Health and Human Services spokesman Jesus Garcia. President Barack Obama said the sharp influx of unaccompanied children from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala was an 'urgent humanitarian situation' More than 33,000 minors were apprehended in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas since October last year, it has been reported . At the base, children are provided with three hot meals and two snacks a day. They can call home twice a week. They have access to mental health clinicians and on-site medical care . The minors flooding over the border are often teenagers leaving behind poverty or violence in Mexico and other parts of Central America such as Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala . The person who takes the child, Garcia says, has to agree to bring the child to an immigration hearing. The minors flooding over the border are often teenagers leaving behind poverty or violence in Mexico and other parts of Central America such as Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala. They are sometimes seeking to reunite with a parent who is already in the United States, also without documentation. Another facility for minors will open at Naval Base Ventura County in Southern California that will hold a maximum of 600 children. At Lackland, the children between the ages of 12 and 17 are handed several sheets and towels when they arrive and checked for lice and scabies. Republicans blame President Obama for the situation, pointing to his 2012 policy that sent a message of hope to kids yearning to stay in the U.S. Photos leaked Thursday from a U.S. Border Patrol facility in the Rio Grande Valley show overflowing holding facilities of immigrants, many of whom are children . Over 400 children a day are coming and as many as 60,000 will cross the Mexican border illegally this year . They then undergo physical and mental health evaluations, and are assigned a metal bunk from among the rows that line the walls of large barracks-style rooms. There is little need for storage because, as social workers put it, few of these children arrived with anything other than the clothes they wore on their journey north. The administration estimates it costs taxpayers $252 per child per day. 'The reasons, as we understand them, that contribute to this dramatic increase have to do with economic conditions in those countries, sustained violence in these countries, and the desire of these children to be reunited with family members in the United States,' Celia Munoz, the White House Domestic Policy Adviser said.","The Joint Base San Antonio Lackland has become a temporary shelter for children and youths caught crossing the border illegally and alone .

"The Coalition is heading for an unprecedented split after Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg forged an ‘unholy alliance’ to try to force through laws shackling Britain’s free Press. David Cameron yesterday pulled the plug on cross-party talks over the Leveson proposals for media regulation. He insisted he would not countenance a deal which would mean politicians being able to interfere with newspapers. Torn apart: The Coalition is heading for an unprecedented split after Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg (pictured here with David Cameron in 2010) forged an alliance to try to force a 'Leveson law' through Parliament . The Prime Minister blamed a ‘hung Parliament’ for his inability to secure backing for his proposals for a Royal Charter for the Press, which would not require legislation – the first time since the general election in 2010 that he has used the phrase. In an extraordinary foretaste of a potential Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition after 2015, Mr Miliband and Mr Clegg agreed to ‘work together’ to try to force some form of ‘Leveson law’ through Parliament. Labour had threatened to hijack several key pieces of Government legislation, including one Bill designed to lift the red tape on business and boost the economy, if Mr Cameron did not back down. Labour and the Lib Dems are now expected to table amendments in the Commons giving MPs the choice of a beefed-up version of Tory proposals for a Royal Charter, backed in law, or a full Bill implementing the recommendations of Lord Justice Leveson’s report. Mr Cameron lost patience overnight and told Mr Clegg and Mr Miliband in a ‘tense’ joint phone call yesterday morning that he saw no point in continuing cross-party talks. Sources said Labour had produced ‘demand after demand’ apparently drawn up in close co-operation with the Hacked Off campaign group, which wants a Leveson law, and made clear it was prepared to wreck the Government’s entire legislative programme if it did not get its way. The Prime Minister said his proposals for an independent body, established by Royal Charter like the BBC, to oversee the system of Press self-regulation would provide ‘the toughest regulation of the Press that this country has ever seen’. The Prime Minister (left) pulled the plug on cross-party talks over the Leveson proposals for media regulation. Ed Miliband (right) has formed an 'alliance' with the Lib Dems to try to force a 'Leveson law' through Parliament . 'Disappointed': Nick Clegg said he was 'disappointed and, indeed, surprised' Mr Cameron walked away from the cross-party talks . He said it was clear that newspapers could refuse to sign up to a system underpinned by statute, as recommended by Leveson and backed by Labour, Lib Dems and Hacked Off. ‘The route I have set out is the fastest possible way to deliver the strong self-regulation body that Leveson proposed that can put in place million-pound fines, prominent apologies and get justice for victims in this country,’ the Prime Minister said. ‘The deal is there to be done. It is the fastest way to get proper justice for victims. There’s no point in producing a system that the Press won’t take part in. As Prime Minister I wouldn’t be fulfilling my duty if I came up with something knowing that it wouldn’t work.’ Mr Clegg said: ‘I was disappointed and, indeed, surprised that David Cameron has decided to walk away from the cross-party talks, especially when they were making some real progress even as late as yesterday evening. This whole issue is a difficult one, striking the right balance between protecting the freedom of the Press, which is essential, but also protecting ordinary people from unwarranted harassment and bullying by the Press.’ Balance: Mr Clegg said it was 'difficult' to strike the balance between the freedom of the Press and 'protecting ordinary people from unwarranted harassment and bullying by the Press' Mr Miliband said Labour and the Lib Dems ‘are determined to carry on working, reaching out to people from across all parties to get a solution that will deliver for the victims, and that will be done obviously through votes in Parliament’. He added: ‘I still believe we can do that on a cross-party basis. In the end we’re going to have to go above David Cameron’s head and work with other Conservative MPs to see whether we can find a workable solution. We obviously have been talking to them over the past few months.’ The Labour leader said Mr Cameron’s decision to pull out of cross-party talks was a ‘historic mistake’ that would let down the victims of Press intrusion. Senior Conservative MP John Whittingdale, who chairs the Commons media committee, said there was a ‘strong chance’ that Mr Cameron will be defeated in the Commons on Monday by the new Lib-Lab alliance. Tory MP Philip Davies said: ‘The future of Press freedom in this country is now under serious threat from an unholy alliance of Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg. The public should be very frightened at the prospect of politicians trying to regulate the Press.’ Conor Burns, a fellow Tory member of the committee, accused Mr Miliband and Mr Clegg of stitching up a ‘squalid little deal’ that would damage free speech in Britain. Hacked Off executive director Brian Cathcart said Mr Cameron’s Royal Charter proposals ‘raises two fingers’ to those demanding reform in the wake of the exposure of phone-hacking by the Press. A group of leading industry figures representing Britain’s biggest newspapers, hundreds of regional and local papers and all major magazine publishers, said in a statement that they shared the Prime Minister’s frustration at the way in which talks on the future of Press regulation had broken down and ‘legislation has been hijacked’. ‘The Prime Minister is right to reject statutory regulation of the Press – free of political control for 300 years – as fundamentally wrong in principle and unworkable in practice,’ they added. Proposal: The Prime Minister said his proposals for an independent body, established by Royal Charter like the BBC, to oversee the system of Press self-regulation would provide 'the toughest regulation of the Press that this country has ever seen' ‘The industry has spent many weeks in negotiating a new independent system of self-regulation, based on the Leveson principles, which provides £1million fines and the toughest system of regulation in the western world. We have made major concessions in order to reach agreement, although there are elements of the proposed reforms – such as exemplary damages – to which we remain opposed. However, this need not stop a new regulator being put in place. ‘We agree with the Prime Minister that matters cannot be allowed to drift on and that we need now to deliver real change. ‘The UK’s newspaper and magazine publishing industry will rise to the challenge. We are ready to move with speed to establish a new system of tough, independent, effective self-regulation which delivers fully on the Leveson principles and will provide real protection for members of the public. We will aim to get the new regulator up and running as soon as possible.’","Cameron pulls the plug on cross-party talks over Leveson proposals .

"International celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal has spoken out against the greedy scalpers who conned their way into winning tickets to dine at his Melbourne pop-up restaurant, the Fat Duck. But while the culinary genius was disappointed with the scam, he admits he can't help but feel a little chuffed by all the attention. Blumenthal also revealed that a Melbourne taxi ride and conversation with the driver confirmed to him that Australia is more than ready for his iconic science-inspired food. Scroll down for video . Celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal is closing his England restaurant temporarily and will instead open a temporary restaurant in Melbourne for six months from September 2015 . Heston Blumenthal's unique sensory dishes have made his one of the world's most notorious chefs . The restaurant, The Fat Duck, will be opened at The Crown in Melbourne in Feburary 2015 for six months . 'I've been completely blown away by the reaction; it's been really humbling,' Blumenthal said about his temporary move to Australia. But he is disappointed that some people plotted to steal extra tickets. 'We worked so hard to make it fair for everyone. The matter is being dealt with; it's not over,' Blumenthal said to news.com.au. Blumenthal's English-based restaurant, The Fat Duck, will temporarily be relocated to Melbourne for a six month stint in 2015. There has been incredible hype since Blumenthal announced that he had selected Melbourne, after considering Las Vegas, St Tropez, Miami and Dubai as possible sites for the relocation. Only 14,000 people will have the rare opportunity to enjoy his world famous cuisine. The 'tickets' are a hot item, with many of the people who were left out desperate to experience Blumenthal's culinary mastery. The British chef's signature dishes infuse science with food and he is known for his kooky creations, including lickable wallpaper a la Willy Wonka and bacon and egg ice cream. But the trouble all began when Australians had the opportunity to enter a ballot to win the chance to dine at the restaurant. It appeared that more than 90,000 people tried their luck for a decadent night at the restaurant, boasting a $525-a-head price. However, it emerged last month that scammers hired IT experts to find a way to enter the competition hundreds of times, using fake names and numbers. The 'tickets' are a hot item, with many of the people who left out desperate to experience Blumenthal's culinary mastery . It's reported that several financial professionals went to great lengths to scam the ballot system, each successfully winning around 40 of the incredibly rare restaurant reservations. Although Crown is currently looking into their legal options, it's claimed the applicants have not broken any law so could potentially be allowed to keep their tickets. The chef warns those responsible for the scam that investigations into the legality of their actions are ongoing. Blumenthal is frequently asked why he picked Australia over any other destination. Despite the ticket controversy, Blumenthal remains thrilled with his decision to temporarily relocate to Australia. From his experiences with Australians in his English restaurant, as well as a chance encounter with a Melbourne taxi driver, he decided that Aussies' 'laidback' demeanour is a perfect fit for his experimental approach to food. The taxi driver suggested 'making an extra hole in his pita bread to separate the various fillings.' Blumenthal told news.com.au. 'Imagine a London cabbie saying that! They'd say: 'You're the chef who does all that funny stuff, innit?' Compared to the 'rigidity' of Italian food rules, Australians are willing to explore new taste sensations, says Blumenthal. 'In Australia, I'm seeing the biggest explosion of food of any country in the world.' More than 250,000 applicants were unsuccessful in their attempt to reserve a table at the 'pop-up' restaurant . However, Australians weren't particularly laid back when it came to acquiring tickets to the Melbourne pop-up restaurant. Ads appeared on online websites such as Gumtree from desperate foodies, offering up to $1000 to buy a ticket to dine at the restaurant – in addition the restaurant's price of $525-a-head. It's believed the scam, which involved reserving seats with a pseudonym but correct contact details, was conducted by scalpers, hoping to increase their chances of winning the tickets and to then sell them at an extortionate price. Other wealthy professionals allegedly employed the same method simply to 'guarantee' they would win reservations. An IT expert in China was hired to work out a way to allow the user to enter the ballot multiple times, according to reports. It's alleged the loophole was found because the website did not record the applicants' IP address. Scroll down for video . Fans of celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal (pictured here outside Fat Duck in England) have taken to social media to express their devastation at missing out on a table at his exclusive Fat Duck restaurant in Melbourne . The revelation comes after a hilarious fiasco when the celebrity chef tried to call the last 13 people to secure reservations to tell them about their success. He had very little success and he and the people around him have been filmed in hysterics as the well-intentioned phone calls went from bad to worse. The tenth person Mr Blumenthal called was the first to finally show a positive reaction. The first nine callers either hung up, did not answer, did not believe him or were just unimpressed with the offer. The first man the chef rang sounded entirely apathetic about the whole experience, explaining that he was not fussed and that his girlfriend has 'already won tickets anyway'. One man was dubious and had a colourful response to the phone call. 'You're sh***ing me, aren't you?' he exclaims. 'I'm not sh***ing you at all, it's me, really,' a bemused Mr Blumenthal responds. Some who were knocked back were trying to negotiate their way onto others' tables . Meanwhile Diana Forward said she was 'so bummed' to miss out on a table . Those who were not lucky enough to get a place have expressed their bitter disappointment on Twitter but not without a sense of humour . 'Missed out in the ballot for a reservation at #fatduckmelbourne,' James Caldwell tweeted . Fans of celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal took to social media to express their devastation at missing out on a table. Those who were not lucky enough to get a place have expressed their bitter disappointment on Twitter but not without a sense of humour. '#fatduckmelbourne ballots are out, sadly I did not get a reservation #sadduck. Guess Ill [sic] get $500 of #maccas [McDonald's] instead,' Julian Ridden tweeted. While Roslyn Grundy said: 'But Heston, I thought we were buddies?' Some who were knocked back were trying to negotiate their way onto others' tables. Twitter user Candice offered up a friend as payment. 'Will trade @Dame_1978 for a table at the #fatduckmelbourne - No luck in the ballot & this looks too good to miss out,' she wrote. But della wilson was more conventional in her method of compensation. 'Willing to pay if anyone has a fat duck reservation for Melbourne #fatduckmelbourne #gutted #alreadybeentodinnerbyheston,' she said. Unsuccessful applicants who have been placed on the waiting list, only at their request, may still have a chance if there are any cancellations. Earlier this year, Fat Duck was named the third best restaurant in the world in an annual poll run by private jet lifestyle magazine Elite Traveler and Champagne Laurent-Perrier. His London eatery, Dinner by Heston Blumenthal also placed 23rd in the top 100 eateries in the world list.","Heston Blumenthal is temporarily relocating to Australia in 2015 .

"Female doctors provide a better quality of care than their male counterparts, according to a new study. Canadian research found that female GPs tended to spend longer with patients, were more likely to prescribe recommended medication and referred more patients for further examinations. However, it also revealed that male doctors were more 'productive' as they treated more patients. University of Montreal research found that female GPs tended to spend longer with patients, were more likely to prescribe recommended medication and referred more patients for further examinations, compared with their male counterparts . The research, which was carried out in Canada and compared 870 general practitioners, found the differences between men and women medics were greater among older doctors. Scientists from the University of Montreal studied the records of doctors based in Quebec, 46 per cent of whom were women. They focused on the doctors' procedures on elderly diabetic patients to see if they were in line with the recommendations of the Canadian Diabetes Association, which provides clear guidelines for clinical treatment of the disease. Lead study author Valerie Martel said: 'Women had significantly higher scores in terms of compliance with practice guidelines. 'They were more likely than men to prescribe recommended medications and to plan required examinations.' The association says patients aged 65 and over with diabetes must undergo an eye exam every two years and receive three . prescriptions for specific drugs, including statins. It also recommends patients . undergo a complete medical examination annually. The research examined doctors' procedures on elderly diabetic patients to see if they were in line with . the recommendations of the Canadian Diabetes Association, which provides clear guidelines for clinical treatment of the disease . The study found that among middle-aged doctors, 75 per cent of women ensured their patients had an eye examination compared to 70 per cent of men, while more women prescribed recommended medications compared to male doctors. A total of 68 per cent of female GPs prescribed statins compared to 64 per cent of male doctors. Patients were also more likely to undergo a complete examination if the doctor was a woman - with 39 per cent completing the examination - rather than a man, at 33 per cent. However, when it came to the number of patients that a doctor had seen, male GPs were found to be more 'productive', reporting nearly 1,000 more procedures per year compared to their female counterparts. Ms Martel, who carried out the research for the Department of Health Administration, said: 'My theory was that differences between male and female practices have diminished over time. 'It seemed to me that more and more men are taking time with their patients at the expense of productivity, and more and more women tend to increase their number of procedures. 'The younger the doctors, the less significant the differences.' The study found that among middle-aged doctors, 75 per cent of women ensured their patients had an eye examination (pictured) compared to 70 per cent of men, while more women prescribed recommended medications compared to male doctors . Professor Regis Blais of the Department of Health Administration, who was also involved in the study, said it confirms that women doctors spend more time with patients. 'People might assume that women doctors spend more time with their patients, but it is difficult to observe in a scientific study - but this study does just that.' He argues that this does not necessarily make female doctors less productive than male doctors who see more patients. Professor Blais said: 'Doctors who take the time to explain problems to their patients may avoid these patients returning after a month because they are worried about a detail. 'More productive physicians may not be the ones we think.' Recent figures from the General Medical Council show that three out of five young doctors on British hospital wards and in GP surgeries are now women. Women made up 61 per cent of doctors under 30 last year and 46 per cent of those aged 30 to 50. However, men remain dominant in the oldest age group, with women comprising less than a third of doctors over 50.","A University of Montreal study found female GPs tended to spend longer with .

"A debt-ridden Romanian man proved to be unlucky in love after trying to sell his virginity for £700 - and failing to receive a single offer. Seb Ciercies was left baffled by the lack of interest having described himself in a local newspaper as 'Athletic, toned and dark-haired'. The 29-year-old virgin conceded that he was 'no Brad Pitt' after his money-making plan flopped - but expressed surprise that nobody wanted to 'try out' his 'great body'. Hunky: Seb Ciercies was left baffled by the lack of interest having described himself in a local newspaper as 'Athletic, toned and dark-haired' Mr Ciercies had announced his intentions to sell his virginity to any takers in Brasov, a city in central Romania - making it clear that transport was 'not included'. Keen to secure an early sale, he did not specify whether buyers should be male or female. He wrote: 'Man, 29, Brasov. Athletic and toned, dark haired. I'm selling my virginity. Price: 850 Euros. Transport not included.' But weeks after placing the advert, aimed at clearing mounting debts, Mr Ciercies was still no closer to abandoning his virtue - and had not had even one response from a potential buyer. He said: 'I don't understand it. I'm a good looking guy with a good physique. I thought someone might even offer me more.

I forgot to specify male or female in the ad and I didn't even get any gay takers. 'It doesn't do much for your self-esteem to be rejected by absolutely everybody in the world.' Seb took out the ad to pay off debts he has run up through unemployment and having to care for his diabetic brother. He said: 'I've worked hard in the fields and in farms all my life.

"The U.S. Defense Department wanted five Americans released in exchange for five Taliban terrorists – not just the single American infantryman now accused of desertion – according to a senior congressional aide. And with the Bowe Bergdahl hostage swap now nearly a week old, the State Department is still insisting that it doesn't offer 'concessions' to 'terrorists' or other 'hostage-takers' Joe Kasper, chief of staff to House Armed Services Committee member Duncan Hunter, a California Republican, said late Thursday that the Pentagon aimed to free Caitlan Coleman of York, Pennsylvania and her baby who was born in captivity, along with her Canadian husband Joshua Boyle, as part of a 'broader goal.' Also on America's wish list was Warren Weinstein, a Maryland man who was abducted in 2011 in Pakistan. A Taliban-aligned sect of al-Qaeda is still holding him captive. The Pentagon 'was looking at this in the whole scope of things, to deal with these people as well,' Kasper told USA Today. 'Instead of five for one, why not five for five?' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Proof-of-life: . Taliban videos of Caitlan Coleman and Joshua Boyle have been released . by their families for the first time. Coleman's father received them in . July and September . Captive: Pregnant Caitlan Coleman and Joshua Boyle are believed to have been taken by the Taliban while traveling in mountains near Kabul . DOUBLESPEAK: State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf said Wednesday that 'our policy is not to make concessions to terrorists' -- just days after the Obama administration traded hostages with the Taliban . But the White House nixed the military's hoped-for deal, Kasper told USA Today, choosing instead to trade five Taliban for Bergdahl alone. The State Department is drawing a firm distinction between negotiating for the release of Bergdahl, a U.S. Army infantryman, and the Hunter family, who were not in uniform. Bergdahl's status 'as a missing or captured soldier,' State Department deputy spokesperson Marie Harf said, 'is distinct from someone who, for example, may be a civilian hostage.' But in a blanket statement to reporters on Wednesday, she said that 'we don’t make concessions to terrorists.' 'So not making concessions does not preclude negotiating,' a reporter shot back. 'Is that what you’re saying?' 'This was an exchange of prisoners in war, ' Harf replied. Another reporter in the room reminded her that 'every administration' since the Guantanamo Bay detention camp opened, have parsed it out ad nauseum that these are not prisoners, these are detainees.' 'Right,' Harf replied. 'You’ve changed your language today and called them prisoners in war,' the astonished reporter said. Journalists challenged Harf, saying the 5-forf-1 Taliban trade 'legitimizes the Taliban to take prisoners of war' -- and accused her of suddenly changign her language to call Guantanamo Bay detainees 'prisoners in war' Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Sen. Dianne Feinstein believes that if the White House had followed federal law and given Congress 30 days to consider a Guantanamo detainee release, more Americans might have been rescied . Harf argued a hypothetical situation: 'Let's say it was important for us to get Sgt. Bergdahl home,' she said. 'Let's say these guys may have eventually been transferred somewhere anyways. I think many of us would make the argument – I would make it – that we should get something for them.' She doubled down a day later, cryptically telling USA Today on Thursday that America has a 'longstanding U.S. policy not to make concessions to hostage-takers.' Rep Hunter wrote to President Barack Obama on Monday, saying that the Pentagon's broader plan for a wider hostage release never had time to mature while the State Department's negotiations rushed ahead. Hunter, a Marine Corps reservist who himself served in Iraq and Afghanistan, also suggested that the Defense Department might have won Bergdahl's release without releasing terrorists at all. He complained to Obama about 'the sudden urgency behind the prisoner swap given other lines of effort offered the same opportunity for success.' 'These efforts should have been fully exhausted before any commitment to exchange prisoners was made,' Hunter wrote.'Now a situation has been created whereby prisoner exchanges — specifically disproportionate exchanges — are viewed by the Taliban and other aligned forces as achievable.' Also needs rescue: Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi, a decorated Marine, has been held in a Mexican prison for two months for taking a wrong turn and entering the country with registered weapons . Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, told Bloomberg Television on Friday that if Congress had 30 days' notice on Guantanamo Bay detainee releases – as federal law requires – Members could have argued for the release of more Americans. 'There are two others in Afghanistan,' Feinstein said, according to an advance transcript obtained by MailOnline. 'One is a young couple with a baby. ... I think they certainly ought to be part of any swap.' 'If there were some consultation, that could have been suggested, to get two Americans out ... But there was no opportunity to do so,' Feinstein added. 'And that’s the 30 days, that you have an opportunity, if there are issues you want to raise or thoughts that might be helpful, actual, to the administration. Nobody knows everything.' Her interview will air Friday night.","The Obama administration nixed a  Defense Department request to get five American hostages – not just Sgt.

"Liverpool centre back Dejan Lovren has given his club manager Brendan Rodgers a potential defensive headache after withdrawing from Croatia's squad with an abdominal injury. The defender was due to play in Euro 2016 qualifiers against Bulgaria on Friday and Azerbaijan on Monday but sustained a problem in training which has ruled him out. 'During training on Wednesday, Lovren felt pain in the abdominal wall. Igor Boric (a specialist) at St Catherine (Hospital) showed there was a tear and he will not be ready for performances in Sofia and Osijek,' said a statement on the Croatian Football Federation's website. Dejan Lovren will return to Liverpool to have his abdominal injury assessed by their medical team . The centre back suffered an abdominal injury while on international duty with Croatia . Dejan Lovren has pulled out of Croatia's squad with an abdominal tear and Mamadou Sakho has a thigh problem meaning Liverpool potentially have only two fit centre halves - Martin Skrtel and the error-prone Kolo Toure. Lovren is set to return to Merseyside in the next couple of days, where he will be further assessed by the medical team at the club's Melwood training ground. Liverpool have had contact with Croatia, but until their own staff have examined the defender they cannot make a diagnosis on the injury. The Premier League club have 10 days before their next match and if Lovren's injury is only minor then it may actually benefit them to have him back early to prepare for the trip to QPR. It is the second successive month Liverpool have had players injured on international duty. Lovren dives in to challenge Saido Berahino during Saturday's 2-1 win over West Brom at Anfield . Manager Brendan Rodgers has publicly expressed his displeasure at England's handling of striker Daniel Sturridge, who sustained a thigh injury in training which has caused him to miss the last seven matches. Last month Rodgers also lost Joe Allen, who injured a knee while with Wales, and fellow midfielder Emre Can, who has been sidelined since picking up an ankle injury in the latter stages of Germany Under-21s' 8-0 win over Romania. Rodgers is confident Sturridge will be fit for the trip to QPR but Lovren's problem, coupled with a thigh injury to Mamadou Sakho sustained in training just days after he walked out of Anfield having been omitted from the squad for the Merseyside derby, means his only two fit central defenders are Martin Skrtel - currently with Slovakia for matches against Spain and Belarus - and Kolo Toure.

"British taxpayers are paying to make jails in Jamaica and Nigeria more comfortable in a desperate bid to persuade foreign criminals to serve their sentences at home. Ministers have resorted to the tactic – designed to satisfy the human rights of inmates – after it emerged that the UK’s own prison system has turned into a ‘United Nations of crime’. Research by the House of Commons library, seen by the Mail, reveals how our jails contain inmates from a staggering 156 countries – more than three out of every four member states of the UN. Jos prison in Nigeria: The government wants to deport some of the 594 Nigerians currently in British prisons . Worryingly, the total number of foreign prisoners is rising – despite pledges by David Cameron to fix the mess. By March this year, there were 11,127 behind bars, at an estimated cost to the UK public purse of more than £420million. This is up from 10,778 in 2011. The group, which includes rapists, murderers and burglars, now makes up more than one in every eight convicts. Underfire: The Prime Minister has put aside £3million a year to try and ensure foreign prisons serve their sentences at home . The figures were disclosed as the Prime Minister faced more criticism yesterday over his foreign aid commitments. Mr Cameron was taking part in a radio phone-in when a pensioner called to tell him it was wrong that she was denied a cancer drug while billions were spent on overseas aid. Meanwhile, it emerged that the dire need to create space in our packed jails has prompted ministers to take the extraordinary step of establishing a £3million annual pot to make it easier for convicts to serve their sentences back home. Splashing money on prisons abroad is certain to prove controversial. But officials insist it will be cheaper in the long run than the annual £38,000 bill for keeping a single prisoner locked up here. Currently, money is being spent in Jamaica to ‘assist Jamaican authorities in modernising their prison service and rehabilitation and reintegration activities’. In Nigeria, one project supports the provision of ‘human rights training for prison officers’. A second project will construct new facilities at a women’s prison in its biggest city, Lagos, to reduce overcrowding. Jamaica tops the list of the nations with most prisoners in British jails, with 900 inmates. There are 594 Nigerians. Last night Sir Andrew Green, chairman . of Migrationwatch, said: ‘To some extent, this is the inevitable legacy . of mass immigration of 3.5million people under Labour. ‘The resources necessary to tackle the rising number of foreign prisoners have not been made available.’ Tory . MP Priti Patel said: ‘Prison is always the best place for dangerous . criminals, but our jails should not be used as hotels for foreigners. Ministers need to take action to deport them to serve their sentences in . the countries they come from and then stop them from coming back to . Britain. St Catherine's Prison in Kingston, Jamaica: Money is being spent modernising the Jamaican prison service as well as rehabilitation and reintegration activities . ‘Living in Britain is a privilege and foreigners who come here and flout our laws should be sent packing without delay.’ In . November 2010, the Mail revealed how the Prime Minister had decided to . spearhead a campaign for foreign criminals to serve their sentences back . home. To do this, ministers must be able . to convince the courts that the offenders will not suffer breaches of . their human rights by being made to stay in squalid conditions. The Ministry of Justice said it had . just signed a new agreement which should see a greater number of . Albanian prisoners being transferred from the UK to complete their . sentences. The . compulsory prisoner transfer agreement is the first they have  managed . to agree with a nation with a large number of foreign national offenders . in UK prisons. They now hope to agree more. There are currently around 180 Albanian prisoners in UK prisons, of whom over 100 may be eligible for transfer. Prudent: Prison Minister Crispin Blunt insists the scheme will save taxpayers money in the long term . The agreement also means that British  citizens who are serving prison sentences in Albania may also be compulsorily transferred back to the UK. Prisons Minister Crispin Blunt said: ‘We are already removing thousands of foreign criminals at the end of their sentence, or under transfer agreements to serve the rest of their sentence back home. ‘We believe that, wherever possible, foreign national prisoners should serve their sentences in their own country. ‘Not only will it save money for the UK, it will also mean that these prisoners will be closer to family and friends.This helps to support prisoners’ social rehabilitation and reintegration into society. ‘Transfers also help their home country to put in place any appropriate public protection measures on their release. ‘I hope this compulsory prisoner transfer agreement will be the first of many arrangements to free up prison spaces and reduce the burden to taxpayers of foreign criminals who should rightly become the responsibility of their own country and not the UK.’ The last government tried a string of desperate tactics to reduce the number of overseas inmates. Offenders were offered credit cards pre-loaded with more than £450 - funded by the taxpayer - if they agreed to return home. The perk was part of a package worth up to £5,000 designed to ‘bribe’ them to leave the UK.","UK jails house inmates from 156 countries, including 900 Jamaicans and 594 Nigerians .

"We have all experienced that disappointing moment a supermarket fails to stock our favourite food. But few will have expressed their frustration in such a novel way as two students from St Andrews University. When classics student Isabelle Bousquette and Tomi Baikie, a maths and physics student, found no Butterkist salted caramel popcorn in the town's Tesco branch they decided to write a sonnet to the supermarket giant. The St Andrews students first wrote to Tesco and the supermarket giant replied with a poem of their own . They elected to put pen to paper after their film night was ruined by the lack of popcorn. Mr Baikie said: 'It wasn't quite the same watching the movie without the popcorn, so instead of watching the movie we sent this poem to Sir Richard. 'The hardest, and most time-consuming part was to get the printer to print on the ivory parchment paper we were using.' The sonnet included lines such as: 'When I went to the shelf popcorn sits on. 'And just found the lump in my throat you get/When something you love is there, then it's gone.' 'I live in St Andrews, thus the issue: ""No plans to restock,"" you said with a sigh. 'So answer this, or hand me a tissue: Have I butterkist my true love goodbye?' The letter was written to Sir Richard Broadbent, who resigned as chairman of Tesco last month following reports of accounting errors and falling sales due to competition from budget stores Lidl and Aldi. Despite Sir Richard's departure, the students still received a reply from the Chairman's Office of the supermarket - also written as a poem. The students wrote a sonnet after finding no Butterkist salted caramel popcorn in the town's Tesco (pictured) The quick-witted reply from Tesco - which incorrectly referred to Mr Baikie as a 'lady' - urges the pair to 'please dry your tears' as 'we'll still sell your popcorn for many more years'. It continues: 'Your favourite popcorn is waiting for you/Across the Tay River, no really it's true! 'Our product is stocked in both Perth and Dundee/And I've found a way you can have it for free.' The reply ends by assuring the two students they will be sent a £10 giftcard for their troubles. The pair uploaded the poems to the 'overheard at St Andrews' Facebook page and it has attracted almost 3,000 'likes' in three days.","Students Isabelle Bousquette and Tomi Baikie found no popcorn in Tesco .

"The age-old problem of spreading butter straight from the fridge has finally been solved - thanks to this nifty new kitchen gadget. The revolutionary device looks like a normal cutlery knife but it has been made with 21 triangular holes down the blade that 'grate' the butter. The tiny strips are much easier to spread than a knife loaded with cold butter so sandwich fans can finally avoid tearing holes in their bread trying in vain to get an even coating. Scroll down for video . Grate invention: The gadget aims to solve the age-old problem of spreading butter straight from the fridge . The other side of the knife has a serrated edge so that it can be used to cut the sandwich or toast in half or get rid of the crusts. Until now, the only way to guarantee a smooth spread has been to take the chilled butter out of the fridge and let it warm up on the side. The stainless steel gadget, called the ButterUp, is the brainchild of friends Sacha Pantschenko, 29, Norman Oliveria, 27, and Craig Andrews, 48.

'We have tried to keep it as simple as possible so that anyone can use it, including children. 'This is a time saving gadget because you don't have to wait for the butter to reach room temperate before you use it and stops you from tearing up the bread.' The team have launched the ButterUp on Kickstarter where they hope to raise £21,000 ($34,990) for the manufacturing costs.

Sportsmail's Carragher ironically posted his own selfie with fellow Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville after the show, but told Monday Night Football: 'It's winding me up - it's an absolute joke. 'It was one giant going to another giant. Of course celebrate, but it’s nonsense all of these team pics in dressing rooms - normally you have them with a cup! It’s nonsense and they need to stop doing it.' Carragher did however pile praise on the Gunners for their disciplined display at the Etihad as goals from Santi Cazorla and Olivier Giroud earned the points. He added: 'I was shocked Arsene Wenger went with those tactics. Besides Man City, it feels like the whole country is pleased Arsenal won that game in that manner.'

While the result was eye-catching, Arsenal remain fifth in the Barclays Premier League table, some eight points adrift of second-placed City and 13 behind leaders Chelsea. Arsenal took the lead on 24 minutes when the excellent Cazorla converted a penalty won when Vincent Kompany tripped Nacho Monreal.

"'Dream come true': Kevin Gardner, right, said catching the majestic 1,320lb Blue Marlin is one of his longstanding ambitions . A pub landlord claims to have caught one of the biggest fish ever by reeling in a 1,320lb blue marlin using just a rod and line. Kevin Gardner said the catch was a 'dream' and now promises to go after a great white shark. Mr Gardner, who set himself the challenge of catching a 'monster' fish 25 years ago, flew its spear-like snout 4,000 miles home to the UK from Ascension Island in the Atlantic Ocean to keep as a trophy. The six metre-long fish is the fourth biggest caught anywhere in the world and believed to be the biggest ever caught by a Brit using a rod and line. He landed the majestic fish after a three hour battle during a ten-day fishing trip. Mr Gardner, who runs the King's Head pub in Coltishall, Norfolk, said: 'Within the first 15 seconds it had stripped off 700m of line, it hit it that fast. 'From where we hooked it to where we got it on the boat was approximately five miles. 'After about two hours I wished I had never hooked it. 'I . was completely burned by the sun, I was suffering dehydration, I had . blisters on my hands from all the reeling, my back ached and my feet . were burned to a crisp.' Although not yet on the endangered list, conservationists are concerned that blue marlin in the Atlantic are being over-fished. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has classified blue and white marlin as 'vulnerable'. Mr Gardner is already planning his next challenge and wants to try and land a great white shark. He said: 'We can't decide if we should go to South Africa to catch a great white shark or Nicaragua for a 250lb tarpon. 'One thing is for sure, I won't be chasing a blue marlin any more - that hurt too much.' Mr Gardner was on the trip with friend Phil Riley, from Liverpool, and Olaf Grimkowksi, a German skipper on the 30ft Rampage boat Hamattan. After . battling with the fish under the 30 degrees South Atlantic heat he . did not realise the size of his feat until he was safely back on shore. He said: 'When we landed it no-one really knew how big it was. It was the end of a dream really. It was really hard work but it's going down really well with customers now.' Kevin Gardner said he battled the giant blue marlin for three hours before finally landing it . The angler said he needed a crane to drag the fish onto the shore after he chased it for miles . He made the nine-and-a-half hour flight to and from Ascension Island on a military plane from RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire. He spent 25 years trying to achieve his dream and even sold his house in 1988 to fund a trip to Australia's Great Barrier Reef. He caught a 750lb black marlin on that occasion and vowed after that to snare a massive blue marlin. The IGFA world record for Atlantic blue marlin is 1,402, which was caught near Brazil in 1992. After his most recent trip, Mr Gardner brought home fillets of other fish, including tuna, he caught to serve to customers at his King's Head pub. He said he also served 18 inch fillets from the marlin to 2,000 islanders as thanks for their hospitality. Mr Gardner said: 'The fish definitely didn't get wasted that is for sure. I gave some of it to the dockworkers, local hotels and to the people who live on the island. The 1,320lb marlin is the fourth biggest caught anywhere in the world and the biggest ever caught by a Brit . A man poses with the marlin - believed to be one of the biggest ever caught . 'I brought the bill back as a memento that I will put on my wall or something because it had never even come into my head that I would catch a fish that big. 'We caught the marlin on day eight of the trip and it was the only bite that we really had on our whole trip. 'I had a fairly substantial bar tab that night and we definitely celebrated in style.' Kevin has been an angler since he was just three-years-old and has now filled a life-long ambition by catching the marlin. He said: 'I'm a very keen angler and I sold my house when I went to Australia to catch a 750lb marlin 25 years ago. 'I wanted to catch a bigger one ever since and I haven't been able to match that until that trip. We have been fishing in New Zealand, Fiji, Panama, Costa Rica, all around the world. 'It has cost us a lot of money but I was going to carry on until I had caught one. 'If you take sharks out of it then it is probably the biggest fish ever caught by a Briton. 'But now I want to go to South Africa and try and catch a great white shark because they are really massive.'","Kevin Gardner said landing the fish off Ascension Island was a 'dream'

"World War II re-enactors today staged the final Siege of Leningrad battle in St Petersburg to mark the 70th anniversary of the fight which ended the Nazi blockade of the city. More than 400 history fans dressed up as Soviet Red Army soldiers and Nazi Germany troops to recreate the battle which ended one of the world's most deadliest sieges. The re-enactment took place in the village of Porogki in Leningrad - now known as St Petersburg - in front of hundreds of spectators. Scroll down for video . Bringing history to life: Re-enactors staged the WWII battle which ended the Nazi Siege of Leningrad on its 70th anniversary . Realistic: History fans dressed as Soviet Red Army soldiers and Nazi Germany troops to recreate the battle . The battle marked the end of the Nazi blockade of the city of Leningrad, now St Petersburg,  in the village of Porogki . It also involved military vehicles, trucks, cars, and motorcycles of the era as wartime planes whizzed overhead while actors sought to imitate the battle as closely as possible. The siege of Leningrad began in September 1941, three months after Nazi Germany launched Operation Barbarossa against the Soviet Union. The German and Finnish siege was broken on January 18, 1943, but it wasn't until January 27, 1944, a year later that it was finally lifted. More than one million people perished during the 872-day siege. Leningrad's name was changed back to St Petersburg after the 1991 Soviet collapse. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin took part in a memorial ceremony in Kirovsk, near his native city of St Petersburg, to mark the anniversary. The 61-year-old leader said the world should never forget 'the courage and heroism of the Soviet people and residents of Leningrad'. The German and Finnish siege and blockade of Leningrad was broken on January 18, 1943, but only fully lifted a year later on January 27, 1944 . A re-enactor dressed as a Soviet Red Army soldier, top, can be seen fighting Nazi troops, bottom . More than one million people perished, many from starvation, during the 872-day siege . Brutal: World War II re-enactors armed with rifles and knives stage the bloody battle . The near two-and-a-half-year siege by Nazi forces is seared into the national consciousness as one of the darkest moments in Russian history. Taking Leningrad was a strategic part of Adolf Hitler's ultimately failed plan to eliminate the Soviet Union as a threat to German domination of Europe. The assault is considered one of the most devastating sieges in history, with German commanders calculating that starvation would be their most effective weapon. '360,000 civilians died in Leningrad over a period of just four months from the end of 1941 to the start of 1942,' Putin said at a meeting with war veterans and survivors of the siege. 'Britain lost nearly the same amount in the entire World War II. Can you imagine the difference between the victims that the Soviet Union and other countries of the world laid on the altar of common victory?' Surrounded by several dozen survivors of the siege, Putin earlier visited the famed Piskaryovskoe Memorial Cemetery, the main memorial to the victims of the siege. A wreath laying ceremony at the Piskaryovskoye Cemetery where most of the Leningrad Siege victims were buried during World War II . Russian President Vladimir Putin lays flowers at the Piskarevskoye cemetery on a memorial to the one million people who perished during the 1941-1944 Siege of Leningrad, now St Petersburg . Putin also honoured the memory of his elder brother who died during the blockade and was buried at the cemetery in a mass grave, the Kremlin said. The president also laid flowers at a memorial on the banks of the Neva River marking the site of one of the most important battles during the siege in which his father participated as a soldier. The blockade of the former imperial capital claimed the lives of more than a million people, according to historians. Most of them died of hunger and exhaustion during an extremely cold winter at the beginning of the siege from 1941 to 1942 when rations fell to just 125 grams of bread per person for white-collar workers and municipal heating was switched off. People were forced to eat pets, earth and glue and some even resorted to cannibalism. Dead bodies littered the streets for days as the survivors were too weak to bury the deceased. Early Monday, some 1,500 people took part in a military parade showcasing Soviet-era war-time T-34 tanks as well as modern Iskander ballistic missiles. In the run-up to the anniversary the local authorities put together an exhibition reconstructing part of a street in the city centre with siege-related artifacts like sandbags, boarded-up windows, theatre bills and old cars and trolleybuses. Russian President Vladimir Putin honoured the memory of an older brother who died during the blockade . Russian President Vladimir Putin pictured at the 'Breakthrough of the Siege of Leningrad' exhibition in St Petersburg . 'When I look at the chronicles and the pictures I can barely hold back tears,' said Natalia Zvereva, 60, who brought her grandchild to see the exhibition. 'It was such an awful time.' Sergei Stepanenko, 45, added: 'My grandmother survived the blockade. She could not talk about it. It was too horrible.' Elsewhere, German lawmakers honored the victims of the Nazi army's three-year siege of Leningrad as part of this year's Holocaust Remembrance Day. German President Joachim Gauck wrote to Putin to express Berlin's 'deep sadness and shame'. 'Germany recognises its historical responsibility for the suffering inflicted on the people of Leningrad and for the brutal warfare of its soldiers, commandos and SS formations,"" he wrote in the letter provided to reporters by his office. 'I tell you and your people that we share the pain for the losses and sympathise with the survivors who are still suffering from the aftermath of the war.' Gauck acknowledged that starving the besieged population into submission had been the strategy of the Nazis. The assault on Leningrad is considered the most lethal siege in history. 'The monstrous scope of human suffering still leaves us aghast,' he said. A Holocaust survivor places a lit candle at the Monument of the Victims during ceremonies to mark the 69th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz Nazi death camp in Oswiecim, Poland . The Soviet Red Army liberated the camp 69 years ago. The Nazis killed around 1.5 million people, mostly Jews, at the camp during World War II . Gauck said that the shared memories of Leningrad served 'to make us particularly appreciate every step toward German-Russian reconciliation'. The German Bundestag lower house of parliament dedicated its memorial day for the victims of Nazi Germany this year to the people of Leningrad. The anniversary coincides with the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp a year later, in 1945. Writer and war veteran Daniil Granin, 95, was invited to describe his horrific memories of the siege to the chamber, where Gauck and Chancellor Angela Merkel were also seated. 'Hunger was brought to the city to wage war, instead of soldiers,' Granin said speaking through an interpreter. 'We had to load the corpses that were so emaciated they were as light as firewood onto wagons. For a long time I could not forgive the Germans,' he said. The 872-day siege by Nazi forces between September 1941 and January 1943 is widely seen as one of the darkest moments in Russian history. The blockade of the former imperial capital claimed the lives of more than a million people, according to historians.","More than 400 actors dressed up as Soviet Red Army soldiers and Nazi Germany troops to recreate the battle .

Eight-month-old border collie Jasper was left with his head wedged through a wall after exploring his home in Hucknall, Nottinghamshire.

But when Jasper's head wouldn't budge, Miss Hourihan called in RSPCA officers, who in turn called out vets and fire crews in a multi-service operation to free playful Jasper. The dog was eventually freed almost three hours after he went off exploring and found himself stuck. Miss Hourihan said: 'I'd let Jasper out in the garden to play just before I went round to see my friend. 'I . called him, and thought it was strange when he didn't come straight . away. We have only had him a few weeks, but he doesn't really go far . from my side. 'I wandered a . bit further down the garden and just saw his little head poking out of . the wall. He was bright eyed, and wasn't in any distress, and my first . instinct was to laugh at him as he just looked so ridiculous. 'However, . when I realised he was stuck, and he couldn't move his head out, I . started to panic. I tried covering him in shampoo, in the hope we could . slide his neck out, but nothing worked.' Tight spot: Firefighters rescuing Jasper the dog after he got his head stuck in an air vent . RSPCA Inspector Nick Wheelhouse said: 'This was certainly one of the more unusual rescues I have been called to attend' After more than an hour of trying to free Jasper, desperate Miss Hourihan gave in and called an RSPCA helpline. But local inspectors were stumped as to how to rescue Jasper - and called in local vets. Miss Hourihan said: 'By this time, my little boy, Alex, eight, was really worried about Jasper, and started crying. 'Then Jasper started getting quite distressed, but the vets couldn't get him out either - so it was time to call for the fire brigade.' All smiles now: The dog was eventually freed almost three hours after he went off exploring . Vet Tom Foster sedated Jasper to prevent him from injuring himself while fire crews cut away at the wall, creating a big enough gap for Jasper to be lifted free. Mr Foster said:  'Jasper was getting distressed by his situation and was putting up a fight so he needed to be sedated to stop him injuring himself. 'After he was sedated he was snoring! His head was down and he was asleep which made it easier for the rescuers to work round him and I stayed to make sure he was stable. I can say this was one of the strangest cases I had been called out to deal with.' Miss Hourihan added: 'Jasper was checked over by the vet and was right as rain, and we're just pleased he's ok. 'He was a bit wobbly on his feet for a few hours, but by the next day he was right as rain and you'd never know anything had happened to him. 'You'd think he would have learned his lesson, but I do have to keep an eye on him - because his favourite place to go and play now is the hole in the wall left by the fire service!' Crew Manager at Highfields Fire Station, Nige Northern said: 'We were called in from Hucknall and Highfields Fire Stations because all other efforts to extricate the dog had failed and our specialist equipment was required. 'We attend rescue incidents of this nature to make sure that people do not put themselves at risk by getting into dangerous situations or using inappropriate tools.  I'm glad to hear the dog is recovering well from its ordeal.' RSPCA Inspector Nick Wheelhouse said: 'This was certainly one of the more unusual rescues I have been called to attend.

"A meeting with Inter Milan stirs youthful memories in John Guidetti. He once wore the famous black-and-blue jersey and dreamed of emulating Zlatan Ibrahimovic. That fondness for this giant of Serie A could have been cemented when he almost joined their ranks barely into his teens. On Thursday, however, he would simply love a chance to play his part in cutting them down to size. Guidetti is on a scoreless streak dating back to November, when a goal against Hearts was his 11th in his first 12 games for Celtic. John Guidetti trains ahead of Celtic's Europa League clash with Inter Milan at Celtic Park . The Swede, on loan from Manchester City, has been replaced by Leigh Griffiths as Ronny Deila’s first-choice striker. But he revealed a return to potent form against Inter would carry special significance. ‘They’re one of my favourite teams,’ Guidetti told Italian newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport. ‘When I was little, I supported Inter. I had the shirt, too. I’m Swedish, and Zlatan (Ibrahimovic) was in Milan, so I was at San Siro for him. ‘Once I nearly even joined Inter, I was about 13, I was taken to Milan and trained there. I also played a bounce game against a former club legend, Beppe Baresi I think.’ While Inter may have been a source of inspiration in the past, Guidetti will look to his current surroundings at Parkhead. A 60,000 sell-out will give the 22-year-old a long-awaited taste of the stadium at its best. Premiership games drawing barely half that number simply aren’t the same. Guidetti (right) revealed he liked Inter Milan as a child, and in particular Zlatan Ibrahimovic (left) To Guidetti, harnessing the power of their support will be crucial as Celtic seek to overcome Inter in the first leg of their Europa League last-32 tie. The striker has plentiful respect for the talent at Roberto Mancini’s disposal, yet is confident Celtic will stand up and be counted. ‘Inter are a very strong team,’ he said. ‘(Xherdan) Shaqiri is great, I played against him in the Feyenoord-Basle match. ‘Hernanes has great technique, and the same is true of (Gary) Medel. ‘They fight from start to finish, but to come to us and win is not easy. ‘Celtic Park will be sold out — 60,000 people. ‘For me, if you take the fans away from football, there’s nothing left. ‘Players come and go, but they (the fans) spend their money to follow the team year after year, and demand only one thing: passion.’ After a brilliant start at Celtic, Guidetti has struggled for goals in recent matches . Guidetti also paid tribute to Mancini, who he previously worked under at the Etihad Stadium. The respect is mutual as the Italian spoke recently of his admiration for the forward’s talents, having handed him a first-team break five years ago. ‘I have a lot to thank Mancini for, he gave me my debut in the first team and advised me to go to Feyenoord (on loan),’ Guidetti added. ‘He was right, I had my best season in the Netherlands. ‘I see he has spoken about me recently. ‘He’s different class, just like he was as a player.’ Guidetti was ineligible to play in the Europa League group stage, so any minutes against Inter would provide a chance to showcase his talents against a higher level of opposition than found in Scotland. The Inter MIlan players, including Lukas Podolski (centre), train ahead of Thursday's match . It might also attract further interest in his services. His City contract expires at the end of the season and talks about a longer stay at Celtic have been postponed for the time being.

"This man has starred in more Hollywood blockbusters than your favourite A lister - but you've never seen his face, until now. Colin Follenweider has built a career performing the stunts too dangerous for the actors - and is paid to make the actions of film heroes a reality - making him Hollywood's most in-demand stuntman. The 38-year-old from Los Angeles, California, has appeared in giant film franchises including Die Hard, X- Men, Iron Man, Avatar, Transformers and Spider Man.

The stuntman spends his working day on locations all over the world getting hit by cars, punched in fights, thrown into walls and flying around on wires - and he loves every minute of it. Colin said: ‘Every stunt man needs to know how to take a punch and fall down, get hit by a car, fall down some steps, that's what we do every day. ‘If you're smashing through glass, you're always going to get cut, hurt, banged up - if you're going to get hit by a car, despite the training, you're still getting hit by a car, and that hurts.

He has 68 stunt credits to his name on IMDB. Colin said: ‘I'm a gymnast so I specialise in aerials and wire work but I love parkour and free running, it's important to do it right and do it convincingly for the movie. ‘My biggest job was Spider Man Three. I loved flying around the city on wires and being thrown from explosions.’ 'A lot of our job is also training the actors we work with, the more of their own stunts they can do, the better for the visual authenticity of the film. ‘Some actors have never taken a punch before, training them so they're up to scratch in a fight scene is essential, so the scene looks good.’ Although some action scenes take place on the green screen, Colin has travelled to film sets all over the world. He said: ‘I spent four months in Puerto Rico working on a film called The Losers where I doubled Chris Evans and Oscar Canada, the weather was beautiful and I couldn't believe how lucky I was. ‘I also doubled Shia LaBeouf in a film called Eagle Eye and was chased by Billy Bob Thornton through an airport. ‘We spent two weeks jumping on conveyer belts in a ship yard.

"Bowe Bergdahl's platoon in Afghanistan was a group of 'raggedy misfits' who had discipline problems even before Bergdahl 'abandoned his post,' a new report claims. Two commanders of Second Platoon, Blackfoot Company in the First Battalion, 501st Regiment were dismissed while the unit was deployed to a remote outpost in Afghanistan in 2009. And the unit came under scrutiny from commanders when pictures emerged of soldiers wearing cut-off T-shirts and bandanas on duty - a violation of military procedure. A report in the New York Times on Saturday cites a classified military investigation that faulted the platoon for lax discipline before Bergdahl went missing from his outpost in  Paktika Province. The Times characterizes the unit as 'raggedy misfits.' Scroll down for video . Bowe Bergdahl, left, was in a platoon that was known having having discipline problems, the New York Times says. One example is soldiers wearing bandanas on duty, a violation of Army rules . The newspaper cites a classified Army investigation of Bergdahl's disappearance that found discipline lapses. Military investigators also faulted Bergdah's unit for having lax security that allowed him to leave the post without being noticed. Leadership was also a problem in the platoon of two dozen men, the Times reports. The officer originally sent to command the unit was relieved weeks after the soldiers arrived in Afghanistan. Soldiers from his unit told the Times his leadership was 'less than inspiring.' Then, the sergeant first class who replaced him as the head of the platoon was disciplined when pictures emerged of members of the unit wearing bandanas and cutoff t-shirts - clothing that is against military regulations. Two platoons commanders were fired by the military during their deployment - including a sergeant who was removed after Bergdahl went missing . Rough terrain: This maps shows the remote outpost in Afghanistan where Bergdahl and his unit were stations in June 2009 . When Bergdahl went missing, the sergeant first class was removed from command, as well. Fox News responded to the report claiming that it was politically motivated. Samuel Masamitsu, who served in the platoon with Bergdahl, denied that the unit's discipline with anything to do with the soldier's disappearance. 'As far as us being dysfunctional or responsible in some way for (Bergdahl's disappearance), I think it's a completely false allegation,' he told the network. Many men who served with Bergdahl say he deserted his post and that six soldiers died looking for him in the following months.","New York Times characterizes Bergdahl's unit as 'raggedy misfits'

"Banaz Mahmod 's father and uncle were jailed for life for her murder in 2007 . Banaz: A Love Story, a new documentary which tells the story of her tragic death, will be previewed at the Raindance film festival this month . Scroll down for video . The tragic story of a young woman who was killed by her family after walking out on an arranged marriage and finding love with another man has been brought into the spotlight once again in a new documentary. Banaz Mahmod, 20, went missing shortly after visiting a police station and telling officers that she believed her family intended to murder her. The film, Banaz: A Love Story, which is to be premiered at the Raindance film festival in London this month, includes never-before-seen recordings made by the Kurdish woman herself, as well as videotapes of the five visits she made to police to ask for help. Scroll down for video . In fear of her life: Banaz Mahmod is seen telling officers that she believes her family intend to murder her during a police interview. She was killed in January 2006 . Harrowing: Banaz visited police five times asking for help . ‘People are following me, still they are following me. At any time, if anything happens to me, it's them,’ Banaz says in a haunting video recorded during one of her police visits. ‘Now I have given my statement, what can you do for me?’ Sadly the police weren’t able to offer her much assistance and Banaz was murdered at her home in Mitcham, Surrey on 24 January 2006. She was strangled with a bootlace and her body stuffed in a suitcase and buried six feet down in the garden of a house belonging to an associate in Birmingham. Banaz's father Mahmod Mahmod and uncle Ari Mahmod were convicted of her murder in June 2007, two other men involved fled to Iraq and were extradited back before being jailed for life in 2010. The harrowing documentary examining her untimely death was made by former pop star and now music producer and film-maker Deeyah, who is of Punjabi and Pashtun heritage. Untimely death: 'We tried to find anyone who would have known her, no one came forward,' says Deeyah who tells Banaz's story in the documentary Banaz: A Love Story . Love story: Banaz's family killed her after she walked out on an arranged marriage and began dating family friend Rahmat Sulemani . Deeyah, who quit touring after being subjected to constant death threats, said that she was extremely touched by Banaz’s story. ‘We tried to find anyone who would have known her, no one came forward,’ Deeyah told The Observer. ‘Then I came across the videotape with Banaz herself, telling us what her suffocating reality was like. Watching this tape for the first time was among the most difficult things I have ever experienced. ‘I had spent three-and-a-half years working on this film, learning everything I could about this young woman's life and her death, we were in the final editing process and suddenly here she was, when no one else would come forward to speak about her. 'I found it excruciatingly sad to see her and at the same time I felt so glad to finally get a chance to see her and hear her. No one listened to her in her life. ‘ . Banaz’s nightmare began when she agreed to an arranged-marriage when she was 17 to a Kurdish man, then aged 28, who she told police was ‘very strict. Like it was 50 years ago.’ She had met her husband-to-be only three times before her wedding day,and according to Banaz, who was 12 she first arrived in England, after fleeing Saddam Hussein's Iraq, with parents . Mahmod and Behya, her husband regularly abused her physically and also subjected her to sexual assaults. ‘When he raped me it was like I was his shoe that he could wear whenever he wanted to,’ she explained. ‘I didn't know if this was normal in my culture, or here. I was 17.’ The terrified young woman left her husband after two-and-a-half years, a decision that angered her family deeply. Family torn apart:  Banaz's older sister Bekhal put her own life at risk by giving evidence against her family in court and her father Mahmod Mahmod was found guilty of murder. Bekhal says she is still living in hiding . After returning to her family home, she met and fell in love with Rahmat Sulemani, a family friend. Rahmat would later give evidence at the trial revealing that he and Banaz had been threatened with death if they carried on seeing each other. The mobile phone footage he took of Banaz when she was lying covered in blood in a hospital bed, in an apparent earlier attempt to murder her, was shown at the trial. The lovers pretended they had parted after the shocking incident, but they continued to meet in secret. They were spotted together in Brixton on January 21 and the Mahmods were informed. Rahmat was kidnapped by four men who told him he would be killed later. When he phoned Banaz to warn her, she went to the police and said she would co-operate in bringing charges against her family and other members of the community. The policewoman who saw Banaz tried to persuade her to go into a hostel or safe house but she apparently thought she would be safe at home because her mother was there. She returned to the family home and was murdered just days later. Banaz’s older sister Bekhal also gave evidence at the trial, putting her own life at risk by testifying against her family in court. Banaz's father (pictured leaving court)  and her uncle Ari Mahmod were convicted of her murder in June 2007, two other men involved fled to Iraq and were extradited back before being jailed for life in 2010 . Jailed: Mahmod Mahmod was sentenced to life in prison for the murder of his daughter . ‘She was a very calm and quiet person,’ Bekhal says of her sibling. ‘She loved to see people happy and didn't like arguments, she didn't like people raising their voices, she hated it. ‘She just wanted a happy life, she just wanted a family.’ Bekhal is still living in hiding five years after her uncle and father were convicted and says she 'watches her back 24/7’. Detective Chief Inspector Caroline Goode was instrumental in in getting justice for Banaz and won a Queen's Award for her efforts. ‘I do think that we are only scratching the surface of this. One of the difficulties is that these things aren't often reported,’ she told reporters in 2007 . ‘In Banaz's case, if her boyfriend hadn't reported it, we would never have known that she was missing.’ ‘Despite the horror, what emerges is a story of love,’ Deeya adds. ‘What has upset me greatly from the very beginning of this project is how absent Banaz was from her own story. ‘Whenever you see a film about someone who has passed you will always have family, friends, people who knew the person, sharing their love, their memories and thoughts about the person who has died; they have home videos, photos. ‘That was just not the case here at all. The only person speaking for Banaz who had known her alive was her sister. Other than that, everyone else in the film came to know Banaz after she had died.’ Watch a trailer for Banaz: A Love Story .

"Labour's shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt, himself privately-educated, said the most immoral people he has met went to public schools . Public schools produce some of the ‘singularly most immoral people’ in society, Labour’s shadow education secretary has claimed in an extraordinary swipe at the independent sector. Tristram Hunt, who was privately-educated himself, risked angering parents and children with his outspoken criticism of former pupils of private schools. He also risks riling his political opponents - and colleagues - in Westminster, where more than a third of MPs went to a private school. David Cameron has been accused of packing his government with a privately-educated elite, including several Old Etonians. Labour last week launched an ad campaign portraying the Tories as out-of-touch Tories sitting around the Cabinet table, mocking the poor and disabled and . Mr Hunt made the comments as he dismissed the ‘smug’ claims from a leading private schools boss that state schools turn out ‘amoral’ children because teachers are too focussed on passing exams. Writing for MailOnline, Mr Hunt said ‘frazzled headteachers and bureaucracy-laden teachers’ have not forgotten nurturing well-rounded pupils is just as important as qualifications. Richard Walden, chair of the Independent Schools Association, suggested many state school pupils end up with no sense of right and wrong. Mr Walden claimed state schools are failing to provide pupils with a ‘moral compass’ because teachers are concentrating on delivering better academic results. But Mr Hunt hit back: ‘Personally, amongst the singularly most immoral people I have met have been those taught within some of England’s leading public schools.’ Around 7 per cent of people in the UK went to a private school but in Westminster the figure is much higher. A study in 2010 showed that 54 per cent of Tory MPs went to a fee . paying school, compared with 40 per cent of Lib Dems. Among Labour MPs the figure was only 15 . per cent, but this includes shadow chancellor Ed Balls, who went to Nottingham High School, shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna, who went to St Dunstan’s College in Catford and deputy leader Harriet Harman, who attended St Paul’s Girls’ School. Mr Hunt attended University College School in Hampstead, north west London before studying history at Trinity College, Cambridge and the University of Chicago. University College School charges fees of £5,720 a term - a total of £17,160 per year. He was a popular author and presenter of history programmes before being elected as MP for Stoke on Trent Central in 2010. In his article Mr Hunt said: ‘Young people leaving state schools are quite obviously not amoral. Neither have frazzled headteachers and bureaucracy-laden teachers forgotten that the nurture of purposeful, well-rounded citizens is as important a part of schooling as the development of successful learners. ‘But there is now a growing awareness that if we choose to focus on exam results, league tables and narrow attainment to the detriment of inculcating attributes of character, grit and resilience, then we are not striking the balance our young people need if they are to thrive in the modern world.’ Richard Walden claimed state schools are failing to provide pupils with a 'moral compass' because teachers are concentrating on delivering better academic results (file picture) However, he suggested that in a ‘peculiar, ham-fisted way’ Mr Walden may have ‘had a point’ about the need to recognise that ‘courage, compassion, honesty, integrity, fairness, perseverance, emotional intelligence…are public goods in and of themselves, not just because they are highly prized by modern labour markets’. In a speech this week, Mr Walden claimed that too many state school staff operated in ‘a climate of fear’ which meant they failed to provide children with an enriching education, he added. Education Secretary Michael Gove dismissed claims state schools are 'amoral' as nonsense . Fee-paying schools devote more time to extra-curricular activities, a broad curriculum and personal, social, health and economic development – meaning their students were able to ‘distinguish the good from the bad and the true from the false’. Mr Walden, head of £6,867-a-year Castle House School in Shropshire, which caters for two to 11-year-olds, made his provocative claims in a keynote speech to fellow heads at his association’s annual conference in Warwickshire. ‘Schools are turning out too many amoral children because teachers cannot find the time to teach the difference between right and wrong,’ he said. ‘It seems that the only results that matter are those which have created added value in terms of raising a pupil’s statistical level from one stage to the next, and parents are increasingly buying in to this notion.’ The remarks have also been criticised by Tory Education Secretary Michael Gove. He said: ‘This is nonsense. State schools are getting better in every respect – from delivering a more rigorous education to ensuring children leave school with the right values. ‘Only a few weeks ago, the head of the independent King’s College School in Wimbledon admitted state schools are improving so fast they are increasingly becoming a threat to private schools. ‘When I visit a school which gets great academic results it is always the case that everything else about the school is also brilliant; the sport, the community involvement, the best drama. Wasting talent, by telling millions of pupils that academic success is not for them, would be truly amoral.’ Tristram Hunt argues that schools should appreciate attributes such as honesty, integrity and fairness as public goods in themselves . Richard Walden, chairman of the Independent Schools Association, has smugly and ineptly accused state schools of failing to provide pupils with a ‘moral compass.’ Personally, amongst the singularly most immoral people I have met have been those taught within some of England’s leading public schools. And most of today’s public school would do better to spend their time reflecting on whether their institutions are living up to their founding principles of providing alms and education to local poor children. As Ofsted’s Chief Inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw has regularly pointed out, that should be the starting point before independent school heads start prescribing solutions for the state sector . Yet buried within Walden’s clumsy, privileged language, lies an uncomfortable kernel of truth. Young people leaving state schools are quite obviously not amoral. Neither have frazzled headteachers and bureaucracy-laden teachers forgotten that the nurture of purposeful, well-rounded citizens is as important a part of schooling as the development of successful learners. But there is now a growing awareness that if we choose to focus on exam results, league tables and narrow attainment to the detriment of inculcating attributes of character, grit and resilience, then we are not striking the balance our young people need if they are to thrive in the modern world. For a start there is the rising tide of mental illness in young people. Meanwhile, technology and social media appear to be making it more difficult to concentrate for long periods at a time. Research, by academics such as Professor Avner Offer at Oxford University, has provided a persuasive argument that ‘the flow of novelty’ in contemporary society is so strong that higher levels of commitment, discipline and self-control are needed to ensure that long-term wellbeing is not repeatedly sacrificed upon the altar of short-term gratification. Then there is the economic argument.  Because whilst the economy of the future will put a high premium on vocational, academic and creative excellence, it will also demand that our young people emerge from education as confident, self-disciplined and resilient individuals. As many employers will testify, outstanding qualifications on their own are no guarantee of the wider aptitudes required by the world of work. So, it is not overly fanciful to suggest that a re-emphasis on the cultivation of character within our schools – what Walden describes as a ‘respect for discipline, sport and culture, service, and personal responsibility’ -  might help boost our global economic competitiveness. Yet we should not need to rest the argument for these ancient education ideals on utilitarian premises. For it is remarkable that just as contemporary moral philosophy has begun to throw off its legalistic shackles and, following G.E.M Anscombe, re-examine what it means for human beings to live well and flourish, social and political discourse has become far more constrained. Courage, compassion, honesty, integrity, fairness, perseverance, emotional intelligence - we should want such attributes for our young people because they are public goods in and of themselves, not just because they are highly prized by modern labour markets. From the Stoics, Plato and Aristotle, to Milton, Samuel Smiles and the Arnolds, for 2000 years schooling has been primarily concerned with the formation of character. But their moral enterprise was always about pursuing this greater good - schools, after all, are profoundly social environments. ‘The noblest heraldry of Man,’ as Smiles called it – ‘that which forms the conscience of society, and creates and forms its best motive power.’ Or as Matthew Arnold wrote, schools should be seen “not as mere machines for teaching, reading, writing and arithmetic, but as a living whole with complex functions, religious, moral and intellectual"". Modern society is far from amoral - if anything we are fed a daily diet of moral panic by a hyper-sensitive, morally-reactive media. However, there can be little argument that the sense of social mission which emerged from the pursuit of character in education has diminished. I don’t blame teachers or school-leaders for that.  Nor do I blame politicians. We all want information about achievement; we all want transparency in our public services; and we know that regular and effective analysis of data can help identify struggling schools and pin-point falling attainment.  But the argument is growing for greater balance in the system. Because there is no doubt that the supportive, dedicated and ambitious communities provided by the best schools is vital to challenging that decline. But we must allow them the freedom to do just that. In a peculiar, ham-fisted way I suspect that was the argument Richard Walden was trying to make. And if so, depressingly, he had a point.","Shadow education secretary risks angering parents and school pupils .

The poll begins with 500 companies for consideration then cuts it down to the 100 brands that have the highest familiarity. Both Coke and Pepsi polled highly, though how favorably people perceive them has dipped in recent years as many now view their products as contributing to obesity, Fortune reports. Rounding out the top ten were Hershey, Bayer, Johnson & Johnson, Harley-Davidson, IBM, Apple, Kellogg, and General Electric. Apple's ranking was of particular interest since CEO Tim Cook is still under pressure to see if he can match the performance of late co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs. Ironically, thought Family Dollar was ranked among the least respected companies simply becoming a recognized brand is considered something of a milestone by the company itself. 'It is actually a counter-intuitive that they even show up here, as . their brand is becoming more powerful year over year,' the report notes. However it could be more recognized because of headlines last year regarding the brand's sluggish sales. Assuming they focus on their public perception, the brand should be able to remove itself from the list. Appearing for the second year in the lest respected spot was Delta Airlines. J.C. Penney was also ranked poorly, as the company's image was damaged two years ago in an attempt to reinvent themselves as a more upscale brand. They have since reverted to their prior identity in stores, but their favorability rating hovers at 60 per cent. Also on the bottom of the list were Denny's, H&R Block, Big Lots, Best Buy, Rite Aid, Capital One Financial, and Sprint Nextel.","Annual survey from CoreBrands evaluates companies based on familiarity, how favorably they're viewed, management, and investment potential .

"A seven-year-old who lost both his legs to meningitis is making a splash after his parents raised £1,000 to pay for a pair of prosthetic flippers to help him swim. Cieran Kelso was just hours from death after he . was struck down with meningitis as a baby and despite pulling through he . had to have both legs amputated below the knee and also lost the tips . of most of his fingers. He was later fitted with false legs . and given a wheelchair to help him get around but he desperately wanted . to swim with his friends. Waterbaby: Cieran is now speedy in the swimming pool thanks to his new prosthetic legs and custom-made flippers . Making a splash: Cieran from Northwich, Cheshire, struggled to balance in the water before he was fitted with new limbs . So his father Gary, 34, and stepmother Gemma, 28, spent months fundraising on his behalf. They raised enough money to pay for a custom-made pair of legs that could be used in water. Paul Leishman, at the Leeds branch of The London Prosthetics Clinic also made him a pair of flippers that attach to the ends of the feet. Mrs Kelso, from Northwich in Cheshire, said: 'Cieran loves swimming and has been having swimming lessons for just over a year but he couldn't propel himself through the water or stay afloat as easily as everyone else. 'As soon as Cieran first wore the . flippers it was incredible the speed he could travel through the water, . his instructor even had to swim with him to keep up. 'We want Cieran to see that even though . his legs were taken away by his meningitis he can still follow his . dreams and be like his friends, just sometimes we have to make slight . adaptations to aid him along the way.' Determined: Cieran (pictured with Gemma, left) won't let his disability get in his way . Dangerously ill: Cieran in hospital after contracting Meningococcal Septicaemia as a baby . Cieran wears the flexible legs to play football and . do some gymnastics and his family are planning further fundraising to pay for new pairs of legs as Cieran grows. They also hope to one day fund a dream holiday to Florida to meet Winter the dolphin. The aquatic mammal has a stump for a tail but was recently fitted with a prosthetic one. She stars in the blockbuster movie 'Dolphin Tale' about her eventful life. Mrs Kelso said: 'When Cieran watched Dolphin Tale, he just couldn't believe it, it's one of his favourites now. 'He obviously took a real shine to . Winter, who has a prosthetic tale and now he dreams of hopefully one day . meeting and swimming with her.' When Cieran first fell ill in 2006 with a high temperature, his father, Gary, rushed him to A&E thinking he had a stomach bug. But within hours he had been diagnosed with Meningococcal Septicaemia and was rushed to intensive care as doctors battled to save his life, and his parents were warned that he had less than three hours to live. Blowing bubbles: Cieran in the pool and wearing his new legs on land with his stepmother and father (right) Winter the dolphin has inspired Cieran, due to coping with a prosthetic tail. His parents hope to organise a trip to visit her in Florida . Champion: Cieran also wears his new legs to take part in gymnastics . Over the next few days Cieran's fingertips began to drop off as a result of the condition, and a short time later the family were told that his legs would have to be amputated. He had two operations to remove his lower legs. After seven and half months in hospital, Cieran was allowed home. He had to learn to walk using his prosthetic legs, and also relied on a wheelchair to help get around. But the youngster didn't let his disability slow him down; he regularly took part in sports day at school and went to gymnastics and swimming classes in the evenings, often without wearing his false legs. He has even won medals for his sporting prowess, including a gold for a floor display and a bronze for a vault against able-bodied children. Mrs Kelso said: 'All we want is for him to be happy and not to hate the fact that he had meningitis. To appreciate, yes that he's different, but that life goes on.'","Cieran Kelso lost both legs below the knee after he was struck down with meningitis as a baby .

"No, she’s not suddenly gone all film star on us... The reason the Queen is wearing dark glasses with a glittering Swarovski ‘Q’ on each side is that she is watching a preview of her Christmas message, which has been filmed in 3D for the first time. Seen here in her 3D glasses as she chats to senior staff from Sky News, who have produced this year’s message, the 86-year-old monarch is said to be thoroughly delighted with the result. Just like being there: The Queen watches her Christmas message in 3D with staff from Sky news, which has produced this year's broadcast . A Buckingham Palace spokesman said the Queen thought the broadcast was ‘absolutely lovely’, adding: ‘We wanted to do something a bit different and special in this jubilee year, so doing it for the first time in 3D seemed a good thing, technology-wise, to do. 'The Queen absolutely agreed straight away – there was no need for convincing at all, she was absolutely ready to embrace something new in this year.’ Bling: Queen Elizabeth II in her 3D glasses, which have a glittering Swarovski 'Q' on the side . It is not the first time the Queen has worn 3D glasses. In fact, the pictured pair were first seen when she went to a movie training centre in Toronto, Canada, in 2010. During her message, which will be broadcast at 3pm tomorrow, the Queen will talk about the impact of London 2012, saying: ‘All those who saw the achievement and courage at the Olympic and Paralympic Games were further inspired by the skill, dedication, training and teamwork of our athletes. ‘In pursuing their own sporting goals, they gave the rest of us the opportunity to share something of the excitement and drama.’ When the message is broadcast tomorrow the Queen and Prince Philip will be at Sandringham with other royals – but they will not be joined by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. The couple have decided to break with tradition as a result of 30-year-old Kate’s pregnancy and continuing sickness and instead spend Christmas with the Middleton family. However, they will make an appearance at Sandringham on Boxing Day for the regular pheasant shoot on the 20,000-acre Norfolk estate and are expected to remain there for a couple of days. The move has led to speculation that the couple may choose to spend alternate Christmases with their respective families, as many modern couples do. Prince Philip at Sandringham yesterday . The Queen missed the Sunday church service at Sandringham for the first time in living memory yesterday after being hit by a nasty bug. A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: ‘She is getting over the tail end of a cold. 'It will certainly be business as usual this week. She hopes to be at church for the Christmas Day service, absolutely.’ Prince Philip, 91, led the royals who did attend the service, including Prince Andrew and his daughters Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie.

"Mother-of-two Barbara Ward cannot exercise for fear of sweating, and has to steer clear of tearjerker films and the daily household chores. For the 43-year-old is so allergic to water that her sweat and tears could kill her. Mrs Ward was diagnosed with the rare disorder after being hospitalised when a shower sent her into severe anaphylactic shock. Any contact with water triggers a painful rash and wheezing and she has to carry two EpiPens at all times as well as taking strong doses of antihistamines every day. Barbara Ward is so allergic to water she has to avoid exercise for fear of sweating, cannot go out without an umbrella in case she gets caught in the rain and avoids tearjerker films for fear of crying . The 43-year-old from Hartlepool breaks out in a painful rash when she comes into contact with sweat, tears, rain and other types of water. She has to avoid simple household tasks and a bath can leave her in severe pain . Mrs Ward cannot even drink plain water and can only handle a few sips of tea or milk at a time. She cannot exercise in case she breaks into a sweat, avoids weepy films in case she wells up, and even has to stay indoors during rain storms. Even the simplest day-to-day tasks such as washing the dishes, bathing her children or going to the pub could kill her. Mrs Ward, from Hartlepool in County Durham, is limited to just two one-minute baths a week, which leave her in excruciating pain. Her condition, aquagenic urticarial, is so rare it only affects one in 230 million people and doctors are still unable to explain what causes her symptoms. She said: 'It’s an absolute nightmare and I react every day to the normal things in life. 'I can’t even read sad posts on Facebook because if I get dragged into an emotional whirlwind and end up crying, I could die. 'I’m used to living like this now but it is such a limited life. 'I’m not like other mums, I can’t even run around with my kids or play with them because the sweat could send me into shock. 'Family get togethers are off the cards and I can’t ever go out for a meal or go to the pub for a pint. 'Other people’s perfume can set me off so going out in public is really dangerous too. It sounds so unbelievable, but I have to live like this.' The mother-of-two takes strong doses of antihistamines every day and has to carry two EpiPens with her at all times in case she suffers life-threatening anaphylactic shock . The mother-of-two first realised something was wrong when she began developing red, itchy rashes all over her body. Doctors initially thought she was suffering from eczema and prescribed her steroid cream, but her condition failed to get any better. It was not until her early 20s that the former call centre worker realised she felt ill after drinking water. 'Whenever I drank water my throat would close up and I’d be really wheezy,' she said. 'Before that, I’d just thought it was acid rain that was making my skin burn but then the penny finally dropped.' Mrs Ward was diagnosed with the rare disorder aquagenic urticarial, after a shower caused her to suffer a severe allergic reaction . In October 2013, after years of suffering, she was finally diagnosed with the severe water allergy after a shower put her in hospital. The allergy, which is barely understood by professionals, can develop later in life and get more serious over time. Now she has to take extra strength antihistamines throughout the day and avoid water at all costs. Her husband Michael, 46, has to carry out all the household chores such as cleaning, cooking and washing. He even takes their children Nathan, 23, Jordan, 19, Natalie, 11, and Jasmine, five, on family holidays and for meals without her. Barbara can only drink tea or milk without suffering a reaction and she has not drunk a glass of plain, cold water for 20 years. She said: 'I really don’t understand how it works, my body is made up of water! No one really knows anything about the condition so I’m lost. 'For some reason I’ve always been OK with tea and milk. 'A sip of tap water can make me have wheezing and angioedema of the throat. My only guess is that it must be down to the chemicals they pump into the water supply.' Mrs Ward has had support from charities Anaphylaxis UK and Allergy UK who are helping her work towards leading a normal life. Maureen Jenkins, allergy expert at Allergy UK said: 'Aquagenic urticaria is very rare and so unpredictable as it can become more severe over time. 'Barbara can drink hot water in tea but not cold tap water because the reaction is a rare type of physical urticaria [itchy rash]. 'This means there are allergic-type symptoms that are not caused by the normal allergy mechanisms. However the reaction is still very real. 'As yet, the underlying biological mechanisms are not understood.'","Barbara Ward was hospitalised after a severe allergic reaction in the shower .

"Just five months ago, Arwen the pitbull mix was found nearly blind at a hoarder's home in the freezing Mojave Desert with 88 other dogs, no shelter and little food or water. But now, a touching film has revealed her incredible recovery - and how she is enjoying a new life with a caring owner and an affectionate brother, another pitbull named Keiko. Arwen, 10, was found surrounded by snow and with scores of other animals after an animal hoarder contacted authorities to say she could no longer care for the 89 dogs on her land. Teams organized by Karma Rescue traveled to the home, which was three hours from Los Angeles, where they found many dogs roaming the property without protection from the cold. Scroll down for video . Nervous: Arwen the 10-year-old pitbull mix was found with 88 other dogs in the Mojave Desert in January . Apprehensive: When she was found, Arwen was uncertain how to interact and shied away from human touch . Those that did live inside make-shift runs were forced to endure dirty enclosures covered in feces which often mixed with the food that was thrown into their cages. But the hoarder, who lived in the unincorporated land of the Mojave Desert, was not doing anything illegal and no charges were pressed. Instead, the volunteers got to work building shelters for the animals until there were enough resources to ferry them to foster homes, The Pet Collective film explains. Arwen shied away from human touch - uncertain how to deal with interactions - and volunteers noticed she was suffering a severe eye infection after exposure to the desert's brutal elements. Lonely: 88 other dogs also lived on the land with Arwen, pictured, but some were locked in enclosures . Long road to recovery: When Arwen was taken from the desert, right, she was suffering severely infected eyes, left, after being exposed to such brutal elements. She underwent surgery to remove scar tissue . Images show that her eyes were . entirely bloodshot and inflamed, leaving the animal in pain and . convincing volunteers that if she had been found any later, she would . have surely been blind. A . volunteer named Alex transported her and other dogs to a boarding . facility - but on the way, another worker suggested that Alex could . provide a foster home. Alex agreed - but soon welcomed Arwen into her home full time. She . took her to the vet and the animal, whose condition was far worse than . originally thought, underwent eye surgery to remove inflamed tissue - . the size of cherries - from her eyes. Other . afflictions revealed Arwen's former life; she had hardly any teeth . after gnawing at the hoarder's fence, and she nervously paced Alex's . home in circles resembling the shape of her previous home. Suffering: Arwen has hardly any teeth after years of gnawing at the fence at the Mojave Desert site . Recovery: She was taken home by one of the volunteers and slowly began to get used to her new life . Settling in: A video reveals her happy at her new home after she underwent eye surgery . 'She had some behaviors that were very typical of dogs that have been unsocialized, in confinement, neglected,' Alex said. 'She walked in circles constantly. 'Her body was deteriorating. Had Karma Rescue not intervened and provided medical assistance I'm sure she would either be dead or in constant pain.' But after attention from Alex and becoming more comfortable in her new home, the pacing became less and her eyes began to heal. She was also nurtured by Alex's other pit bull, Keiko - and in no time became a 'perfect' dog, Alex told the Pet Collective. Loved: She is pictured with her new owner, Alex, who called her affectionate - and 'the perfect dog' At home: The 10-year-old dog has also found a friend in Alex's other boisterous pitbull, Keiko, right . Forgiving: Even though she was so poorly treated in the past, Arwen now loves humans, Alex said . All smiles: Alex said that even though Arwen had been so apprehensive, rescue dogs really do recover . 'Animals like Arwen, they really do make a full recovery,' she said. 'She doesn't bear any grudge against people. She really, really loves being around people even though they were so bad to her to begin with. 'I'd always heard people say their dogs were perfect and once Arwen recovered she turned into this dog that is absolutely reliable, confident, affectionate. 'I thought I had had good dogs before but now I know what a perfect dog is.'

"It could be a snap taken from a fun filled family holiday, as a diver who is grinning from ear to ear swims in glorious blue waters wearing nothing but flippers, goggles and a pair of Speedos. But look closer and at that shadow lurking below and the scene becomes less one of happiness and more one of horror. That's because the bold swimmer is actually a marine conservationist who has decided to take a dip with a great white shark circling ominously beside him. Posed up: The relaxed diver spreads his arms in joy despite the fact that a 10-foot killer is lurking in the shadows below . Closer look: The diver is part of a team of conservationists who take pictures on marine environments in a bid to boost conservation projects . Care free: The swimmer, sporting little other than some swimming equipment and a pair of Speedos, came within touching distance of the shark . While most will only share the killer fish's natural environment with the help of a reenforced cage, this scientist is part of a team who feel quite at home floating withing touching distance of the powerful predator. They spotted the beast whilst swimming off the coast of the Baja . Peninsula in Mexico. The divers, who take underwater images of stunning marine environments to support conservation projects, documented their encounter with the shark in this series of stunning snaps. Teamwork: He was joined by another photographer in a wetsuit who swam alongside the dangerous animals to capture the stunning images . So close: The second snapper appears to take his life in his own hands as he reaches out to touch the great white's tail . Unconcerned by the prospect of being . torn to shreds by the deadly species which, up until 2012, had . been responsible for 69 human deaths, the care free swimmer and his . camera crew happily circled the sedate beast. Swirling among schools of fish, the . photographers even posed alongside the beast, coming within . inches of being able to pull its tale. Sharks typically attack humans when . they mistake them for seals or other marine animals which form part of . their diet. They have been known to attack people to take 'test bites', . with experts claiming a shark can tell whether or not a target is worth . eating with one assault.

"Elton John is due to perform in Russia this Friday and Saturday – but the concerts could be called off by local officials if they believe his performances will break their ‘gay propaganda’ laws. Despite Sir Elton being one of the most famous performers in the world, having sold more than 250 million records worldwide, if officials suspect he’s going to use his appearances to rail against Russia’s new rulings, they will pull the plug, according to The Times. Quoting Russian paper Your Day, it reports that preparations for the concerts – in Moscow's Crocus City Hall and Kazan - have already been a considerable expense. Risk: Russian officials could pull the plug on Sir Elton . The rider – a list of requests – apparently runs to 50 pages and includes his hotel dressing room in Moscow being turned into a ‘paradise garden’ populated by ‘decorative birds’ and trees. Sir Elton, who reminisced in an interview in September about having sex on a Moscow rooftop with a translator during his 1979 Soviet Union tour, said he wanted to perform in Russia to support the gay community. 'As a gay man, I can't leave those people on their own without going over there and supporting them. I don't know what's going to happen, but I've got to go,' he said in the interview. One of the world's most prominent gay celebrities, he lives with his partner David Furnish, with whom he is in a civil union, and they are bringing up two children together. He has campaigned for gay rights in Britain and in Ukraine where he was denied the right in 2009 to adopt a child because of his age and marital status. This summer, anti-gay campaigners warned Elton not to wear 'flamboyant' clothes at his planned concert in Krasnodar in July.  The concert was later cancelled when the singer fell ill.

'Promoting homosexuality' is an offence in several Russian regions, including Krasnodar, St Petersburg, and Novosibirsk. In September a Russian parents' committee asked President Vladimir Putin to cancel the planned concerts, saying he intended to violate a ban on 'homosexual propaganda'. In an open letter to Putin, the local parents' group in central Ural region was reported by media as saying: 'The singer intends to come out in support of local sodomites and break the current Russian law, directed at protecting children.'","Promoting homosexuality is an offence is several Russian regions .

"They are among the most fearsome creatures on earth, but this killer shark looks as though it is flashing a massive grin as it comes face-to-face with a daring photographer. Far from trying to rip 26-year-old cameraman Zach Ransom to shreds with its deadly knashers, it instead appears to pull a series of poses which reveal a somewhat friendlier side. Incredibly, the stunning pictures were taken my Mr Ransom without the safety of a protective cage. Jaws-dropping: A fearsome shark gets up close and personal with cameraman Zach Ransom - and appears to flash him a grin . Smile! The deadly creature flashes his pearly whites as snapper Zach tries his luck and gets ever closer . Poser: The shark strikes another grin for the cameras and is photobombed by a friend . The aquarist at Seaworld Orlando went under water with his friends at Little Bahama Bank in the Bahamas to get the incredible images. The area is a hotspot for tiger sharks, as well as species such as lemon shark and reef shark, allowing the divers to get up close and personal with the potentially dangerous animals. Mr Ransom, from Orlando, Florida, said: 'I've always loved the ocean since I was a child. I think most children start out with a love of sharks, dinosaurs and outer space - I just never grew out of it. 'I have been diving for 14 years now and most of that time has been spent in search of sharks. 'This location north of West End, Grand Bahama, is an incredible area with relatively untouched coral reefs and some of the healthiest shark populations on the planet. Daring: Zach got so close to the sharks he was able to touch them . Fearless: Zach, from Orlando, Florida, opted to go underwater without any protection from a cage . Surrounded: Zach is circled by three sharks hut is unmoved as he continues to take his incredible pictures . 'Sharing the water with such an immense and powerful creature is thrilling for sure but the experience is so much more than that. 'I feel completely calm and at peace in these situations. Sharks are amazingly deliberate and cautious in their movements and though a highly instinctual animal they still display curiosity with regard to the novelties in their world. 'Eye contact is an important part of being in close quarters with large sharks, when you break your gaze, they often decide it's safe to move a little closer. 'So to capture these moments with my camera and share them with the world in hope of possibly breaking some negative stereotypes, that is the payoff for me. 'And if I can play some minuscule role in preventing a species from going extinct in my lifetime then that is my purpose.' Zach argues that while activist groups, film makers and photographers are turning the tide in shark conservation, there is still more that needs to be done to protect them. That's more like it: This shark strikes a more traditional pose . Razor sharp: These teeth could do some serious damage but Zach was undeterred . Endangered: Some shark species have dropped by up to 90 per cent . Under threat: Every year between 20 and 100 million sharks are killed by fishing activity . He added: 'People flock from around the world to see African lions in their natural environment, however, none dare to leave the relative safety of the safari vehicle. 'This is of course due to an innate respect for the apex predator of the ecosystem. Thousands of people interact with sharks everyday unprotected, without incident. 'Lions are often revered and respected as beautiful creatures, iconic to the continent of Africa. As the apex predators of the ocean, sharks should be regarded with the same esteem. 'Every year between 20 and 100 million sharks are killed from fishing activity. As many species are slow to mature and may only produce one pup a year it doesn't bode well for long term population. 'Some species' populations have dropped 50-90% but in recent years many people have become aware of the plight that sharks face with regard to the fining industry and over fishing in general. 'Although the numbers are quite grim - I still have hope that it's not too late.'","Fearless Zach Ransom got up close and personal with fish in the Bahamas .

"Get the lowdown on the midfielder who snubbed Arsenal for Madrid . Real Madrid have no plans to let midfielder Asier Illarramendi leave in the January transfer window and he remains an important part of the European champions' squad, coach Carlo Ancelotti said on Friday.

"When John Simpson's beloved chihuahua Mr Cutie went missing from their Florida home last week, the cancer patient feared he may never see his friend again. The Vietnam veteran, who has only days to live, said his only wish in the world was that he could hold his tiny dog one final time. And on Friday night that wish was granted, after the woman who found Mr Cutie took him to the hospice for a tearful reunion. Scroll down for video: .

Miss Figueroa says she found Mr Cutie running around close to the hospice, according to the Examiner. But when the pair met in the hospice, it was clear from the wagging tail and Mr Simpson's tears that Mr Cutie had returned. An overwhelmed Mr Simpson, who says he has been praying to St Jude, the patron saint of lost causes, for the safe return of the dog, said: 'I feel like crying,' as Mr Cutie scampered over him and licked his owner's face.

It had been diagnosed on Thanksgiving last year. Ann Marie Gemmel, who has been caring for Mr Cutie in Holiday, since Mr Simpson moved to the Pasco County hospice a few weeks ago, says the dog dug a hole under a fence and disappeared the day after she took him to visit his owner. 'That dog's never tried to dig a hole. Saturday was the first time I took the dog here to hospice. That next day, he got out. I really think he was looking for John,' she said. Friends of Mr Simpson had searched his home town of Holiday for Mr Cutie, putting up posters and setting up a Facebook page to draw attention to the urgency of finding the missing dog and to co-ordinate their search efforts.

"At least 16 people have been killed by a violent volcanic eruption on the island of Sumatra, Indonesia, which sent ash spewing several miles into the air. The dead include a TV journalist, four high school students and their teacher who went to see Mount Sinabung up close after being told it was becoming safer. Only yesterday thousands of villagers were allowed to return to their homes on the slopes of the volcano despite the fact it has been erupting sporadically for four months.

At least 16 people have been killed by a violent volcanic eruption on the island of Sumatra in Indonesia which sent ash spewing several miles into the air . Catastrophic: The volcano erupts in Banos, yesterday sending ash and pyroclastic material into the atmosphere . Authorities had evacuated more than 30,000 people after the earlier eruptions which sent lava, gas and rocks from the 8,530ft peak .

Distraught: A man weeps after identifying a family member killed by the eruption in Kabanjahe, Sumatra . Trauma: Thousands of villagers have been displaced by the eruptions, with families torn apart . A series of huge blasts and eruptions thundered from the 8,530-foot-high volcano, spewing lava and pyroclastic flows up to three miles away . At least three other people have been injured and officials fear the death toll will rise further. Rescue workers have been hampered by darkness and cannot get closer to the affected areas because of the heat. Authorities . had evacuated more than 30,000 people, housing them in cramped tents, . schools and public buildings, after the earlier eruptions which sent . lava, searing gas and rocks from the 8,530ft peak. They culminated today in a series of huge blasts which sent lava and pyroclastic flows up to three miles away, said officials. Caught: Officials have said 16 people have died but they fear the death toll could rise . Harrowing: Rescue workers set about looking for bodies and survivors but their job was made more difficult by the intense heat, the dark and the threat of another eruption . Villagers were seen tending to the charred corpses of victims, themselves covered in thick grey as, as far as two miles from the peak. Many in the rural island communities had been desperate to return to check on their homes and farms, presenting a dilemma for the government. But hundreds of villagers also demanded to be moved safer areas because they were scared to go back. Evacuee Naek Sembiring, one of 156 camping in a church, told The Jakarta Post two months ago that his entire village had agreed they would not return despite the situation being declared safe. 'We fear we might die,' he said. 'Our village is nearest to Mount Sinabung. In the event of an eruption where would we run to?' Policemen sit on an utility vehicle as they search for victims of Mount Sinabung eruption in Karo, North Sumatra, Indonesia . Dilemma: Evacuated locals had only been permitted to return home yesterday but today had to leave behind homes and farms as the ash reached further and further down the volcano's slopes . Deadly: Lava and pyroclastic flows have spread from the volcano, killing people up to two miles away . Deadly: Lava and pyroclastic flows have spread from the volcano, killing people up to two miles away . Yesterday authorities allowed nearly 14,000 people living outside a three-mile danger zone to return home after volcanic activity decreased. Others living close to the peak have been returning to their homes over the past four months despite the risk. After today's eruptions all those who had returned have been ordered to move back to evacuation centres. 'The death toll is likely to rise as many people are reported still missingand the darkness hampered our rescue efforts,' said Lt. Col. Asep Sukarna, who led the rescue operation. Indonesia is prone to seismic upheaval due to its location on the Pacific Ring of Fire, an arc of volcanoes and fault lines encircling the Pacific Basin. Mount Sinabung had been dormant for 400 years until it erupted in 2010, killing at least two people and displacing 30,000 others. It is now among about 130 active volcanoes in Indonesia and has sporadically erupted since September. But despite volcanos being notoriously hard to predict, it is difficult to keep farmers away because the slopes of the mountains are highly fertile. In 2010, 324 people were killed over two months when Indonesia's most volatile volcano, Mount Merapi, roared into life.

"A doctor who abducted her six-year-old daughter and vanished in the wake of a marriage break-up has been told by a judge 'the courts will not give up'. Deputy High Court Judge Clive Heaton issued a warning nearly two years after Humma Dar, 39, disappeared with daughter Aamina Khan, who will be eight in July. The judge said it was impossible not to have sympathy for Aamina’s father Safraz Khan, 44, from Croydon, south London, who is also a doctor and had been given custody of the girl. Abduction: Judge Clive Heaton issued a warning nearly two years after Dar disappeared with her daughter Aamina . He said the search for Aamina and Dar - who vanished from Morden, south-west London, in August 2011 and are thought to be in Pakistan - had not reached its end. He was speaking at a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in London, where he gave permission for Aamina to be identified in media reports. 'The abduction of children is a very serious matter and the courts should and do pursue, locate and return such children to their rightful carers,' said the judge. Father and daughter: The judge added that it was impossible not to feel sympathy for Aamina's father Safraz Khan, who had been given custody of the child . 'The message must go out to those who . abduct children that the courts will not give up after a few months or . years just because no progress seems to have been made.' He added: 'This is not the end of the story so far as attempts to locate Aamina are concerned.' Mother: Humma Dar is thought to have taken her daughter Aamina to Pakistan after she abducted her . The judge said Dr Khan - who broke down during the hearing - was 'distressed and frustrated'. 'It is impossible not to have sympathy with the father,' he said. “I urge the father to continue to pursue all proper steps open to him to locate his daughter. Where the court can properly assist him in the search it will certainly do so.” The judge said Aamina had been visiting her mother when the pair vanished on August 26 2011. He said Dr Dar had 'abducted' Aamina and evidence suggested that they had gone to Pakistan. Dr Khan had begun civil court action in the hope of finding his daughter and police in London and Pakistan had been involved in trying to trace Dr Dar - who had been hoping to be a GP - and Aamina, the court heard. 'It is an extraordinarily serious matter,' said the judge. 'This child has been missing ... for approaching two years.' He added: 'Sadly the whereabouts of both the mother and child remain unknown.'","Aamina Khan was abducted by her mother Humma Dar two years ago .

"Jose Salvador Alvarenga in a picture taken before he left on his 'fateful trip' Pictures have emerged of the 'castaway' fisherman who claims to have spent 14 months adrift at sea, taken before he disappeared on a shark hunting trip. An image showing a fresh faced Jose Salvador Alvarenga, beaming at the camera and looking remarkably more healthy than the bedraggled figure he cuts now, came to light last night. Alvarenga insists that he owed his survival in the Pacific to his basic instincts to feed himself and drink whatever liquids he could find, as long as it wasn’t sea water. He told of scooping tiny fish from the side of his boat, grabbing seagulls to eat raw, and drinking the blood of turtles and his own urine when rain water wasn’t available. By all accounts, it was an astonishing story of survival on the world’s biggest ocean, drawing comparisons with the Tom Hanks movie Cast Away. But last night questions began to emerge about his story, sparked not least by his plump appearance. Then there was the matter of whether his 24ft fishing boat, with its broken-down motor, could have covered the 8,000 miles from Mexico, where he set out, to the Marshall Islands in the 14 months he said he was drifting. He said he could not remember the name of the place in Mexico where he began his fishing trip on December 21, 2012, nor the name of his home village or his family’s phone number. Scroll down for video . Alive! The first picture of Jose Salvador Alvarenga, still with his tangled hair and scraggy . beard, as he arrives in Marujo, in the Marshall Islands after 14 months . adrift at sea. He looked plumper than expected - but doctors say his . body could be swollen from the conditions he endured . Desperate: Jose had drifted in his 24ft boat for 14 months across 8,000 . miles of treacherous seas, finally dragging himself ashore, his skin . scorched by the unforgiving sun, his shorts in tatters decayed by the . sea salt . I . made it: Jose gives the thumbs up for MailOnline from his hospital bed. He is looking forward to calling his family, but says he has forgotten . his telephone number and what his hometown is called . Neither could he provide officials with contact details of any of his three brothers he says live in the US. Officials in the Marshall Islands – a cluster of atolls and islands north-east of Australia – said that until they could hear Spanish-speaking Alvarenga’s full account they would remain sceptical. His tale has drawn comparisons with the film 2000 Cast Away, with Tom Hanks . Gee Bing, the acting secretary of foreign affairs, admitted to having doubts after meeting him yesterday. ‘It does sound like an incredible story and I’m not sure if I believe his story,’ he said. ‘When we saw him, he was not really thin compared to other survivors in the past. I may have some doubts. Once we start communicating with where he’s from, we’ll be able to find out more.’ Mr Bing said Alvarenga had no identification on him – which would be expected for a man who ended up wearing only tattered shorts. Another minister, Tony de Brum, said: ‘He is not fully coherent.’ And an interpreter who helped interview Alvarenga wrote in a report: ‘He is hungry, swollen, in pain, extremely loopy and wants a haircut.’ As part of attempts to confirm his identity so searches could be made to trace his wife and ten-year-old daughter, who he said lived in El Salvador, a detective went to the hospital where he was resting yesterday to take his fingerprints. But while some officials had questions about his story, Alvarenga’s fishing boat, according to villagers on Ebon atoll where he had come ashore, bore all the scuffed signs of a vessel that had been at sea for a long time. And there are explanations for his apparent well-fed appearance. Medical officials said he might be suffering from edema, a swelling under the skin caused by fluid retention which in turn is the result of too much sun and salt. According to Alvarenga’s account, he had been living in Mexico for more than a decade, working as a shark fisherman. Fourteen months ago, accompanied by a teenager named Ezekiel, he set out to catch sharks for a company he worked for in the city of Capachula, near the Guatamala border. Skeptical: His spotty memory does not help investigators who are looking to patch the story together . Disoriented: Doctors said that his psychological battle will be harder than his physical one . Hope: . Jose said that thoughts of his family kept him alive. He said: 'I know . they would have been worried about me, thinking that I was dead. Yes, I . know I am so lucky to be here, alive' Lost soul: Jose revealed that his companion died after just four weeks. He was only aged between 15 and 18 . Ezekiel, he said, died after four weeks of drifting because he could not keep the raw bird meat and fish down and shied away from drinking his own urine. When he died, said the fishermen, he lowered his body over the side. ‘I am sad for him,’ he said. Then began weeks and months of drifting and battling to survive. He thought of taking his life as depression set in, ‘but I couldn’t do that. I prayed instead. I believed God would protect me – but what God gave me was not easy. ‘I always fished off the coast of Mexico and I didn’t know what was out there in the big sea, but that is where I was taken to by God. Every day was the same, just the sea, the sea. I saw nothing more. The sea and my boat.’ How had he kept his sanity? ‘When you need to eat, when you need to drink, you keep your mind alive. I thought of my wife and daughter all the time and knew they were missing me.’ He eventually ran on to a reef at Ebon atoll. Locals fed him and gave him water, then he was taken the 250 miles to the administrative district of Majuro where yesterday he began to tell his story.","Image shows a fresh faced Jose Salvador Alvarenga, beaming at camera .

"If your resumé describes you as a 'go-getting hard-worker who thinks outside the box', don't bet on getting that dream job. A survey of 2,200 hiring managers in the U.S. found that obfuscating language was a pet hate when reading through hundreds, if not thousands, of applications. New research revealed the most overused terms by job hunters across a wide-range of industries and company sizes - with 'best of breed', 'go-getter', 'think outside of the box' and 'synergy' topping the list. When it comes to finding your dream job, research has found that people have a better chance of success when they cut the jargon from their resume . One in six HR people spend less than 30 seconds reading a resumé when looking for potential job candidates, according to the study by CareerBuilder. The majority (68 per cent) spend less than two minutes scanning that carefully crafted document - so the advice is to make the words count. Rosemary Haefner, vice president of human resources at CareerBuilder, said: 'Hiring managers prefer strong action words that define specific experience, skills and accomplishments. 'Subjective terms and clichés are seen as negative because they don’t convey real information. 'For instance, don’t say you are ''results-driven''; show the employer your actual results.'

"Friend's account: ¿She lived with him of her own free will. She was not a prisoner,' however police arrested Garcia Tuesday and are pursuing kidnapping charges . The lawyer for a man accused of kidnapping a teenager and holding her captive for a decade- during which time they got married and had a child- is now alleging that the woman is making up the claims because the couple was in the process of breaking up. The woman, whose name has not been released but is now 25-years-old, was reunited with her mother who then convinced her to go to authorities to report that she had been kidnapped. Orange County prosecutors on Thursday filed five felony charges against the alleged abductor, Isidro Garcia, including rape and kidnapping to commit a sexual offense. He did not enter a plea, and his arraignment was continued until June. He is being held on $1million bail. Police . described an ordeal during which the now 25-year-old woman — broken . through mental, physical and sexual abuse — was moved at least four . times and given multiple fake identities to hide her from family and . authorities. The woman, who . police did not identify by name, said she often thought about escaping . but stayed out of fear, even though in recent years she was not . physically held captive. She . told police that Garcia said her mother was not looking for her and . that if she contacted authorities, her family would be deported. Then, . in April, the woman got in touch with her mother after finding her . sister on Facebook to wish her a happy birthday, Santa Ana Police Cpl. Anthony Bertagna said. The . mother showed the daughter news articles written at the time of her 2004 . disappearance to prove that she had gone to the police and filed a . missing-persons report, according to Bertagna. 'The mother was able to show her that she was, in fact, looking for her,' Bertagna said. The woman said in a television interview that she was overjoyed to be reunited with her family. 'I was very afraid about everything because I was alone,' she told KABC-TV. When . reached by phone by The Associated Press, the woman's mother said she . had no comment because police told her not to speak with media. Held for years: The top left apartment is the home where Isidro Garcia and his wife, who claims to have been held captive by him for a decade, were living in Bell Gardens, California . Police said that the woman, who they did not identify, had arrived in the U.S. from Mexico several months before her abduction and did not speak English at the time. On Monday, she contacted police in the working-class city of Bell Gardens to report a domestic violence incident with Garcia. During that investigation, authorities realized her connection to the 2004 case. 'You can't go home. You're here illegally. You don't speak the language. Your mom's called the police. They will . send you back. I'm your only hope' -Isidro Garcia said to his 'wife', according to a Santa Ana police spokesman . Garcia forced the woman to marry in 2007 and fathered a daughter, now 3, with her, Santa Ana police said. In . Bell Gardens — near Los Angeles and about 20 miles from where she . originally vanished — stunned neighbors who knew the suspect as Tomas . Medrano found the woman's portrait of him hard to reconcile with the man . they knew. 'He treats her . like a queen. He does his best to do whatever she wants,' next-door . neighbor Maria Sanchez said Wednesday in Spanish after police announced . Garcia's arrest. The woman told the station that her neighbors believed Garcia was a good man because he provided for her. 'He . worked hard for me and my daughter, and he bought everything I want. But I didn't want that,' she said with her mother, sister and daughter . at her side. 'I need love from my family, not things.' Under the radar: Neighbors say Isidro Garcia was a doting family man who sacrificed and worked two jobs to provide for his wife and daughter. But his wife says she was forced into marriage in 2007 . Unthinkable: One neighbor described Garcia and . the wife police believe he brainwashed into living with him for a decade . and even having his baby as the 'perfect couple' Fearful: Though the smiles and happy pictures, police see a woman who was too terrified to go to authorities for years in the belief she or her family would be deported . 'Every weekend they would go out, have fun, do what every normal family would do,' a different neighbor told NBC Los Angeles. Another could not understand why the woman did not escape sooner if she felt threatened, saying: 'She has her own car and she could have easily driven to the police station and said ""I don't feel safe.""' Bertagna said his department's investigation has concluded only a handful of facts. The girl arrived from Mexico in February 2004 to join her mother and sister in Santa Ana, about 30 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles. She had entered the United States illegally. Garcia was her mother's boyfriend. After one fight between the girl's mother and Garcia in August 2004, the girl's mother left the house and the girl went to a nearby park. Garcia followed the girl. When he caught up with her, she said she had a headache and wanted to go home. 'He told her then, ""You can't go home. You're here illegally. You don't speak the language. Your mom's called the police. They will send you back. I'm your only hope,""' Bertagna said. Garcia gave her five pills that he said would help her headache but instead knocked her out. When the girl awoke, she was locked in a garage in Compton, a city between Santa Ana and Los Angeles. 'Happy' family: Neighbors are split over whether Garcia, his 'wife' and their son were normal and happy or living in fear of disobeying him . Home or prison: Garcia met the girl when she was 15-years-old and he was dating her mother . The mother 'filed a police report and . for 10 years (police) did due diligence. But they were changing their . names and dates of birth and physical locations so that made it . exceedingly difficult,' Bertagna said. In . 2007, Garcia got documents from Mexico that gave the girl a new name . and date of birth. Using those documents, he married her at a . courthouse. Police said the woman tried to escape twice but was severely beaten. 'He worked hard for her' -Lourdes Hernandez, the babysitter for the couple's child . Elizabeth . Smart, who was kidnapped from her Utah bedroom at 14 and held captive . for nine months, told The Associated Press that people cannot know what . victims are going through and should not question why the woman didn't . escape sooner. 'We don't . know what these evil people are holding over them — whether it's their . families' lives, their lives, whatever it is,' Smart said. Marisa Cianciarulo, a law professor at Chapman University, said immigrants who came to the United States illegally are vulnerable to certain kinds of manipulation. 'The threat that 'I am going to get your family deported' is a very real threat,' Cianciarulo said. 'Any interaction with law enforcement, whether it is federal, local, can be seen as very threatening and frightening to undocumented immigrants.' In addition, small acts of kindness — a bit of food, permission to use the bathroom — can create positive feelings within the victim that the captor then exploits, said Dr. Frank Ochberg, an expert on the psychology of captives. Garcia lived in Bell Gardens for about four years. The family had the second-floor corner unit of a stucco apartment building in a quiet neighborhood across from a park. Neighbors said Garcia always said hello, joked with neighbors and sometimes brought them fruit. His wife worked for a nearby janitorial service, and he held at least two jobs — including one making egg rolls — and also collected cardboard and recyclable items to sell. Addressing the news: Officer for the Santa Ana Police Department spokesman Anthony Bertagna describes how a missing girl was located after 10 years during a media briefing outside the police station on Wednesday in Santa Ana . Garcia said he wanted to save money so that his wife didn't have to work, said Lourdes Hernandez, who baby-sat their child for a year. The family threw elaborate parties that included costumed characters and raffle giveaways. A video taken at their daughter's birthday party last year shows the mother with the girl in her arms, line-dancing behind her husband as he wiggles his hips. Hernandez said the woman took Zumba classes in South Los Angeles and sometimes invited her along. She said she found the woman's story hard to believe. 'He worked hard for her,' she said. Neighbors said the family took trips together to Disneyland and the beach, and even up north to visit Garcia's family. 'I'm astounded she waited so long to say something,' said Rita Salazar, who lived across the street from the couple.","Isidro Garcia, 41, now faces five felony charges including rape and kidnapping to commit a sexual offense .

"He’s had the fanfare welcome now for the future. Sportsmail looks at what awaits Martin Odegaard after his first day of training as a Real Madrid player on Friday.... 1. The dream team team-mates . Real Madrid are building a youth side that will take them to 2020 and beyond. Norwegian wonderkid Martin Odegaard has completed a £2.3million move to Real Madrid . The 16-year-old gives a cheeky smiling during his unveiling at Valdebebas on Thursday . Odegaard admitted the chance of working under Zinedine Zidane influenced his decision to join Real . Los Blancos are planning a 2020 dream team with the likes of Marcus Asensio and Scotland's Jack Harper . They signed Marcus Asensio from Mallorca last year beating Barcelona to the punch. They have Scoltand’s finest Jack Harper scoring goals for them in the Uefa Youth League. And they have Zinedine Zidane leading the B-team with the idea that he could do as Pep Guardiola did before him and become first team coach eventually replacing Ancelotti and then training the same players for the senior team. 2. Daddy’s home . Odegaard comes with his father Erik who has taken a coaching job at the club. Odegaard's father Erik will be joining his son as a coach at the Bernabeu . Having a father close by does not always help a player’s development. Bojan had his father with him at Barcelona but Pep Guardiola never took too kindly to what he felt was pressure from Bojan senior to speed his kid's progress and it played its part in the player having to leave the club to further his career. 3. Dedication . He has already picked out Cristiano Ronaldo as his role model. The Ronaldoesque dedication will not be problem because according to his father Eric he has trained 20-hours a week since the age of seven. Odegaard poses with his idol Ronaldo and Sergio Ramos after being welcomed to Madrid . The youngster will look to Real Madrid talisman Cristiano Ronaldo as a role model . 4. Nerve . If he does get to make his full debut sooner rather than later then he’ll be able to handle the pressure. He was given his full Norweigan league debut by current Celtic manager Ronny Deila just 15. 5. Friends in high places . Iker Casillas was called out of school aged 16 and told to report to the headmaster's office where he was then given the news that Real Madrid wanted him to join the squad for the Champions League trip to Rosenborg. He went to Norway aged 16 as Real's third keeper, Martin has made the journey the other way at the same age – they should have plenty to discuss when he trains with the first team. Legend goalkeeper Iker Casillas also arrived at Real Madrid as a 16-year-old . 6. Fans favourite . He should have no problem becoming a fan with the club’s supporters known as Vikings because, to quote the fans themselves: ‘We’ve always lauded it over Europe’. 7. Role model . He might want to follow the likes of Gareth Bale and Ronaldo but the last great Scandinavian through the doors at the Bernabeu was Thomas Gravesen. The midfielder they signed from Everton might not have won anything in his time in Spain but he is now living the life in Las Vegas. Odegaard can look to Dane Thomas Gravesen (right) as the last great Scandanavian to play for Real Madrid . 8. Loan star . If Real do have to loan him out to get him game time it wont be the end of the world. Dani Carvajal went to Bayer Leverkusen when Jose Mourinho felt he was too raw for La Liga. After one great season he returned and is now first choice for club and country.","Norwegian wonderkid has joined Real Madrid in a £2.3m deal .

"When Victoria Beckham boasted that her body was ‘completely natural’, two things immediately stood out. One was that she seemed to be fibbing. And the other was her apparently miraculously expanding chest. Now the former Spice Girl has admitted that she did have cosmetic surgery to enlarge her breasts. Speaking about it for the first time, she added that she then changed her mind and had the procedure reversed. Scroll down for video . Before and after: Victoria Beckham in 1997 (left) and in 2006 following the cosmetic surgery . Mrs Beckham reportedly visited a London clinic to go from her natural 34A to a 34DD following the birth of her first son, Brooklyn, in 1999. At the time she insisted her inflated look was down to support tape inside her clothes and push-up bras. She even said: ‘I’m completely natural, except for my fingernails, and I have a bit of help with my hair and a bit of a St Tropez [fake tan] going on.’ But her lawyers admitted in 2005 that she ‘had in fact undergone breast enhancement surgery’. Now Mrs Beckham, 39, who had her fourth child, daughter Harper, in 2011, has spoken about her fake boobs. ‘I don’t have them any more,’ she told the American magazine Allure. ‘I think I may have purchased them.’ According to her biographer Andrew Morton, the initial enhancement surgery nearly 15 years ago set her back £10,000. Although she has never before publicly admitted to artificially increasing her bust size, she has confessed to cringeing at photos showing her inflated chest. Surgery: According to her biographer Andrew Morton, the initial enhancement nearly 15 years ago set her back £10,000 . Reduction: Her lawyers admitted that she had undergone breast enhancement surgery in 2005, but claims she does not have them anymore . She once told an interviewer: ‘I’ve worn so many dresses in the past and when I see the photographs I think, crikey, my boobs are up round my neck again.’ She also cryptically told the British edition of Vogue magazine in 2011: ‘No torpedo bazookas. Gone.’ She declined to elaborate at the time. In next month’s issue of Allure, the fashion designer also talks about her beauty secrets. She says she doesn’t shave her legs but instead has laser hair removal on the advice of her friend Eva Longoria, the Desperate Housewives actress. ‘It is amazing. You can go back for little touch-ups if you do see little hairs appearing,’ Mrs Beckham says. ‘But I’ve been very lucky that I haven’t had to. That was one of the best tips that Eva Longoria ever gave me.’ In the interview she is also full of praise for her footballer husband David, 38. ‘[He] is the most wonderful man I have ever met,’ she says. ‘He’s a fantastic father. He’s incredibly talented, a wonderful husband. I supported him for many years, and he’s proud of me. He supports me. We’re very equal at home.’ She sounds nostalgic for the time the family spent living in Los Angeles after her husband’s career took them there, telling the magazine: ‘Living in America for six years was the happiest I think I’ve ever been. It was much more accepting for a woman to have a career, as well as a man. And I loved it.’ But Mrs Beckham, who moved back to Britain with her family last year, is quick to add: ‘I’m not saying I’m not happy now. I’m just as happy now!’ The designer, who tells Allure that she gets up at 6am every day and runs four miles a day, is likely to be flying back to America frequently as she goes about establishing a base for her eponymous womenswear label in New York.","Mrs Beckham reportedly went to a .

"As recently as last Sunday, day-trippers looking to take a scenic drive through upstate New York were able to pull up directions on Google Maps to a tiny hamlet called Agloe nestled in the Catskills. The distant, virtually unknown locale has since been wiped off the map, but the real kicker to this story is that Algoe never really existed. In the early 1920s, a small patch of land between the towns of Rockland and Beaver Kill in Sullivan County was nothing more than a dirt-road intersection of New York Route 206 and Morton Hill Road. Paper town: On March 17, 2014, Google Maps removed the fictitious town of Agloe from the virtual map of upstate New York - nearly 90 years after it was created by a pair of cartographers . Geographic ruse: Otto G. Lindberg, head of the General Drafting Company, and his assistant, Ernest Alpers, made up a fake town and positioned it in Sullivan County as a way to protect their map from being lifted by other companies . Hardly anyone ever visited the largely deserted, out-of-the-way site located some 120miles from New York City, which made it an ideal 'copyright trap,' as NPR reported last week, citing Frank Jacobs' blog Strange Maps. Cartographers seeking to prevent other companies from lifting their work without permission often resorted to trickery, inserting fictitious landmarks as tell-tale signs of piracy. That is what Otto G. Lindberg, head of the General Drafting Company, had in mind when he teamed up with his assistant, Ernest Alpers, to concoct an entirely imaginary 'paper town', which the pair dubbed Agloe - the name an anagram of their initials, O.G.L. and E.A. The General Drafting Company, one of the 'big three' mapmakers in the country in the 1930s, sought to safeguard its intellectual property. To do that, Lindberg and Alpers positioned the entirely fake hamlet of Agloe on the map of upstate New York just north of Roscoe. In the event of a copyright lawsuit, all they needed to do to prove that their map had been pirated was to point to Agloe, which obviously did not exist on any other map except their own because it was fake. Lindberg and Alpers' clever ruse was put to the test when a few years later, the map company Rand McNally printed its own version of a New Yoke State map, which featured the made-up Agloe. In a bizarre twist, when Rand McNally officials were questioned in court about the existence of the fake homestead on their map, identical in its spelling and location to that of the General Drafting Company’s, the competitors pointed out that their draftsmen found a building in that location called the Agloe General Store, suggesting that the business was named after a geographic location. It so happened that the country store's name was inspired by Lindberg and Alpers' fake town, which the owners had discovered on a map at an Esso gas station, thus effectively turning a 'paper town' into a real place. Ironic twist: When Lindberg sued the map company . Rand McNally for ripping off his map containing the bogus 'copyright . trap' hamlet of Agloe, the defendants pointed out that their draftsmen . found a building in that location called the Agloe General Store . In the New York Times’ retelling of the story, it was a fishing lodge named Agloe, not a general store, which helped Rand McNally get off the hook in the copyright case. In The Times account, about five years after Lindberg came up with Agloe, he paid a visit to the fishing lodge named after the fake town and informed its proprietor that he was the one who put the place on the map, literally. However it may be, over the years, the enigmatic Agloe has gained a small following among amateur cartographers - and more recently, bookish teens. In 1957, a piece in The Times waxed poetic about scenic drives through the Catskills and mentioned 'an unmarked country road that goes north through Rockland and Agloe.' Agloe's popularity spiked in 2008, when the make-believe town appeared in John Green's young adult novel called 'Paper Towns' (soon to be turned into a motion picture produced by Fox 2000). All that remains of the fabled Agloe now is a derelict barn, a former creamery, an old wooden airport hanger, a castle-like structure owned by the Masonic Order, and the rundown building that once housed the Agloe fishing lodge. But the legend of Agloe, the upstate New York Shangri La, lives on.","Agloe is fictional town that mapmakers Otto G. Lindberg and Ernest Alpers put on map of Sullivan County in 1925 .

"Sickening new images have emerged purporting to show young Syrian children being trained at a military camp run by Islamic State terrorists. The photographs, understood to have been taken at a school near the jihadis' de facto capital Raqqa, show children barely older than five being taught basic combat and survival skills, learning how to use enormous assault rifles, and being given lessons in extremist ideology. The disturbing images of the school, said to be named Al-Sharea, were shared online by Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently - a small activist collective which secretly documents the shocking violence and oppression the terror group has brought to their home city. Sickening: New images have emerged purporting to show young Syrian children being educated at a military camp run by Islamic State terrorists . Shock: The images show masked Syrian children under the age of 16 being trained to use assault rifles . According to the activist group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently, the Al-Sharea school is specifically run to provide militant training to young males under the age of 16. Its objective is understood to be to wildly distort the views of young Raqqa residents, creating an entire generation for whom the idea of Islamic extremism and acts of terrorism are second nature. In much the same way as the Nazi Germany preyed on its impressionable young citizens with the creation of the Hitler Youth, ISIS has long groomed children to take part in jihad. The practice was the subject of the second episode of VICE's groundbreaking 'Islamic State' documentary series, in which very young boys were seen being asked whether they want to be a suicide bomber or a jihadist, and were forced to repeat calls for the murder of Western 'infidels'. Grooming: The images,  taken at a school near ISIS' de facto capital Raqqa, show children barely older than five . Loss of innocence: A young boy smiles as he emerges from a tunnel on a terror training course at the Islamic State school . Disturbing: The images of the school, said to be named Al-Sharea, were shared online by Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently - a small anti-ISIS collective operating in the terror group's de facto capital city . In the VICE footage, ISIS' PR man Abu Moussa - who has since been killed - describes how every male child is forced to attend Sharia camps to be taught the militants' radical interpretation of Islam. After the age of 16 the boys are sent to a military camp, where they are given intensive training in the art of warfare and prepared for possible future as either front-line militia or suicide bombers. The images of the school in Raqqa emerged as a small group of Syrian rebels entered the embattled border town of Kobane from Turkey  on a mission to help Kurdish fighters battling the Islamic State. The group of around 50 armed men are affiliated with the Free Syrian Army, and are separate from the 150 Iraqi  peshmerga fighters who are also en route to Kobane. Warped: The Al-Sharea school is specifically run to provide militant training to young males under the age of 16 . Weapon: The school's objective is to wildly distort the views of young Raqqa residents, creating an entire generation for whom the idea of Islamic extremism and acts of terrorism are second nature, activists say . Idriss Nassan, a Kurdish official from Kobane, said the Free Syrian Army fighters crossed into Kobane through the Mursitpinar border crossing in Turkey. Nassan, who spoke in Mursitpinar, said they travelled in cars but did not have more details. The Free Syrian Army is an umbrella group of mainstream rebels fighting to topple Syrian President Bashar Assad. The political leadership of the Western-backed Free Syrian Army is based in Turkey, where fighters often seek respite from the fighting. The 150 Iraqi peshmerga troops arrived in Turkey from Iraq early today and were expected to cross into Syria later in the day. Their deployment came after Ankara agreed to allow the peshmerga troops to cross into Syria via Turkey.","Disturbing photographs show young children receiving terror training .

"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have chosen celebrity portrait photographer Jason Bell to take the official pictures to mark the christening of their son Prince George. Bell is renowned for his images of Hollywood stars and rock and pop legends like Sir Paul McCartney, actress Scarlett Johansson and former England footballer David Beckham. The baptism of William and Kate's baby will be held this afternoon in the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have chosen famed photographer Jason Bell to capture the christening of Prince George today . The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh are expected to be at the christening along with Charles, who has become a grandfather for the first time, and the Duchess of Cornwall . Duke of York and Duchess of York leaving the Chapel Royal with Princess Beatrice, the last well known royal baby to be christened at St James's Palace, in December 1988 . Kensington Palace confirmed the commission of Bell in a statement, reading: 'The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have asked Jason Bell to be the official photographer at the christening of their son, Prince George. Mr Bell will take the official photographs at Clarence House following the service in the Chapel Royal. 'Jason Bell is a well-established portrait photographer and his work has appeared in many of the world's foremost publications. 'Many . of Jason's photos have been acquired for the National Portrait Gallery . for their permanent collection. He has received a number of awards, . including The Royal Photographic Society's Terence Donovan Award for . outstanding contribution to photography and the Best British Black and . White Photographer at the British Picture Editor's Awards. Mr Bell will take the official photographs at Clarence House following the service in the Chapel Royal . 'He was made an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Photographic Society in September 2011.' The photographs taken after the ceremony will be historic images that are expected to capture four generations of the royal family together. 'The pictures will show the Queen with three future monarchs - the Prince of Wales, William and George. It will echo the picture taken in July 1894 during the christening of the future Edward VIII, showing the royal baby with his father, later George V, grandfather, the future Edward VII, and great grandmother, Queen Victoria. Bell's images have been featured in the National Portrait Gallery and published in glossy magazines like Vogue and Vanity Fair. William and Kate's three-month-old baby will be welcomed into the Christian faith surrounded by his immediate family and the close friends of his parents. The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev Justin Welby, who has already spoken of the 'great privilege and honour' of baptising George, said today he hoped that others will be inspired to seek the same ceremony for themselves and their children. He added: 'As a nation we're celebrating the birth of someone who in due course will be the head of state. 'That's extraordinary. It gives you this sense of forward looking, of the forwardness of history as well as the backwardness of history, and what a gift to have this new life and to look forward.' The guest list has not been released but Kensington Palace has said that 'close members of both families' will attend.

The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh are expected to be at the christening along with Charles, who has become a grandfather for the first time, the Duchess of Cornwall and Prince Harry. Kate's family - parents Carole and Michael Middleton and siblings Pippa and James - are likely to be invited, along with the godparents who have not been publicly named. There has been speculation about who the Cambridges might choose to be their son's godparents.Close friends Hugh van Cutsem and Thomas van Straubenzee are thought to be in the running along with Old Etonian James Meade. Prince William's childhood friends Thomas van Straubenzee (left) and  Hugh Van Cutsem (right) are believed to be among the contenders for the role of godfather . In past decades, senior royal babies - the Queen, Charles and William - have been christened at Buckingham Palace. But the Cambridges have chosen the Chapel Royal, where the coffin of the Duke's mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, lay before her funeral. Princess Beatrice was the last well known royal baby to be christened at St James's Palace, in December 1988. George will be christened in a replica of the intricate lace and satin christening gown made for Queen Victoria's eldest daughter, Victoria, the Princess Royal, in 1841. The Earl and Countess of Wessex's son, Viscount Severn, became the first royal baby to wear the new robe at his christening in 2008. Enthusiastic crowds began gathering at the gate of St James's Palace in London more than 24 hours before today's ceremony. Baring banners and dressed in Union Jack outfits, Royal lovers eagerly wait for the chance to catch a glimpse of the Royal Family as they arrive at the Palace.

"A World War II assault rifle that belonged to an SS officer was handed in to a gun buy-back organised by police in Connecticut. The rare find, which is worth up to $40,000, would have been sent home by an American soldier who had taken it from a prisoner of war or a German he had killed. Officer Lewis Crabtree, of the Hartford Police Dept, said: 'The chance to see a piece of history - this - is absolutely unbelievable.' Piece of history: The storm rifle is thought to be a Sturmgewehr 44, made in 1944 and issued to SS troops . Remarkable discovery: The gun was brought to the U.S. by an American soldier, who would have taken it from a German he had killed or taken prisoner . The gun was  developed in 1944, holds a 30-round magazine and can shoot 500 rounds per minute. It was handed in to the police by a woman on the first weekend of December, when they also collected 55 pistols, 91 revolvers, 13 rifles and two derringers. The buy-back scheme is designed to reduce the number of guns in circulation, and entails police officers purchasing any gun, no questions asked. As soon as they saw this weapon, officers realised it was something out of the ordinary, and agreed to allow the woman to sell it. 'Usually, this rifle would be issued to SS troops,' Officer Crabtree told NBCnews. 'This is a gun that should actually be in a museum rather than in a shredder. 'I give her credit for bringing it to us.' His colleague John Cavanna, a gun historian, added: 'In excellent condition, this gun is rated at $30,000 to $40,000. 'You could kill a soldier back then, and . if the captain of your fighting unit signed off on it, you could send . that gun home to your family or kid brother or cousin. '[The seller's] father, who was a World War II army man, had brought this gun home from the European theater.' Every modern assault rifle produced today is based on this design, Officer Cavanna added. Interesting detail: Officer John Cavanna, a gun historian, was thrilled to see the weapon, which he said was the basis for every modern-day assault rifle . In battle: A photo of a German infantryman with a Sturmgewehr 44 in 1944, taken from the Federal Archives (Bundesarchiv) in Berlin . The gun found at this month's buy-back is believed to be a StG 44 or Sturmgewehr 44 - literally 'storm [or assault] rifle [model of 19]44'). It was developed in Nazi Germany during World War II and was the first of its kind to see major deployment. It is now considered the first modern assault rifle by many historians. Among the attachments available for the StG44 was the Krummlauf, a bent barrel that permitted firing around corners. A trained soldier with a StG44 had an improved tactical repertoire, in that he could engage targets at longer ranges but still be effective in close combat, as well as providing covering fire like a light machine gun. The rifle was also found to be exceptionally reliable in the extreme cold of the Russian winter. Its rate of fire varied between 500 and 600 rpm. A total of 425,977 StG 44s were produced by the end of the war, by which time a newer version was being made. Semi-automatic reproductions are still being made in Germany today. It is unclear how many original StG 44s are left, although a cache of 5,000 were captured by Syrian rebels in the city of Aleppo in August of this year.","Gun brought to the U.S. by American soldier and passed to his daughter .

"A candidate in the European elections was arrested on suspicion of racial harrassment after quoting a passage about Islam, written by Winston Churchill, during a campaign speech. Paul Weston, chairman of the party Liberty GB, made the address on the steps of Winchester Guildhall, in Hampshire on Saturday. A member of the public took offence at the quote, taken from Churchill's The River War and called police. Scroll down for video . Liberty GB European candidate Paul Weston, was arrested on the steps of Winchester Guildhall after a member of the public complained about a passage about Islam, quoted from Winston Churchill's book The River War . Police officers arrested Mr Weston, mid-speech, for failing to comply with their request to move on under the powers of a dispersal order made against him. He was further arrested on suspicion of religious or racial harrassment . Officers spent around 40 minutes speaking to Mr Weston on the steps of the Guildhall before he was detained and taken for questioning . The River War by Winston Churchill charts the former Prime Minister's time serving during the Sahdist War in Sudan . The passage from the book, written by the wartime Prime Minister and first published in 1899, focuses on Churchill's observations about Islam while serving during the Anglo-Egyptian reconquest of the Sudan. Mr Weston told his audience: 'Improvident habits, slovenly systems of . agriculture, sluggish methods of commerce, and insecurity of property . exist wherever the followers of the Prophet rule or live. 'Thousands become the brave and loyal . soldiers of the faith: all know how to die but the influence of the . religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it. 'No . stronger retrograde force exists in the world. Far from being moribund, . Mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith.'

He was further arrested on suspicion of religious or racial harrassment. The former Prime Minister Winston Churchill wrote of his experiences while serving in Sudan. He is pictured, right, in 1895 - four years before The River War was first published - in his military uniform . A Hampshire police spokesman said: 'A . 50-year-old man from Dorset was arrested outside Winchester Guildhall at . approximately 2.30pm on Saturday, April 26 after he failed to comply . with a section 27 dispersal order. 'The dispersal order was issued following complaints from members of the public about the man's behaviour. 'How dreadful are the curses which Mohammedanism lays on its votaries!,' wrote Churchill. 'Besides the fanatical frenzy, which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia in a dog, there is this fearful fatalistic apathy. 'The effects are apparent in many countries. Improvident habits, slovenly systems of agriculture, sluggish methods of commerce, and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the Prophet rule or live. 'A degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement; the next of its dignity and sanctity. 'The fact that in Mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property – either as a child, a wife, or a concubine – must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of Islam has ceased to be a great power among men. 'Thousands become the brave and loyal soldiers of the faith: all know how to die but the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it. 'No stronger retrograde force exists in the world. Far from being moribund, Mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith.' 'He was further arrested on suspicion of religious/racial harassment. 'He has been bailed pending further inquiries to report back to police on May 24.' A Liberty GB spokesman said: 'Mr Weston was standing on the steps of Winchester Guildhall, addressing the passers-by in the street with a megaphone. 'He quoted an excerpt about Islam from the book The River War by Winston Churchill. 'Reportedly, a woman came out of the Guildhall and asked Mr Weston if he had the authorisation to make this speech. 'When he answered that he didn't, she told him, ""It's disgusting,"" and then called the police. 'Six or seven officers arrived. They talked with the people standing nearby, asking questions about what had happened. 'The police had a long discussion with Mr Weston, lasting about 40 minutes. 'At about 3pm he was arrested.

"It has emerged that almost a dozen Minnesotans have left the Midwestern state to take up arms for Islamic extremist groups in the country. The revelation follows the news that two Minnesota men were killed fighting for ISIS in Syria this past weekend. The White House confirmed that Douglas McArthur McCain, 33, who went to high school in Minneapolis, died while fighting Free Syrian Army rebels in Syria with the Islamic State. A Minneapolis father-of-nine, Abdirahmaan Muhumed, 29, has been confirmed as the second American jihadi to die fighting for ISIS in Syria. Scroll down for video . Radicalized: This picture tweeted earlier this year by journalist Mukhtar Ibrahim shows Abdirahmaan Muhumed, a Minnesota man recruited by ISIS terrorists to fight in Syria . They are among almost a dozen Minnesotans out of the estimated 100 Americans who have joined the fighting in Syria. The FBI's Chief Division Counsel in Minneapolis, Kyle Loven, told ABC News that the phenomenon began in 2007, with Somali-Americans from the state traveling to Somalia. 'In Somalia, it started as a nationalistic call... [but] we’ve now seen where some individuals perhaps are not interested or not inclined to travel to Somalia, [they] start to branch out to other hot spots around the globe, obviously Syria being among them,' Loven told ABC. One of those initial recruits was Troy Kastigar, a high school friend of McCain who died in bloody fighting in 2009. Minnesota's martyrs come from diverse backgrounds - some Muslim, others Christan, some migrants and others born-and-raised Americans - but often have one thing in common: no direction. For those lost, disaffected youths, extremist groups offer an exciting destination to those going nowhere in life. The mother of Kastigar, who also knew McCain, said the young men were particularly susceptible. In an interview with the New York Daily News, she described both young men as 'sort of searching.' 'I think both of them had a really strong desire to be needed and (be) of value,' she said. 'Searching': Douglas McCain (left) and Troy Kastigar (right) were high school friends in suburban who died five years apart as martyrs for the Islamic terror group ISIS . Mohamud Noor, a Minneapolis community leader, concurred. 'They are young men who are vulnerable, who have been taken advantage of because of their situation,' Noor told ABC. 'This is a youth who has lost direction, who has no hope in life, and the only way they can find [it] is to find other means of living.' In a recruiting video aimed especially at Minnesotans recorded before his death, Kastigar, a Native American, exhorted others to join him in Syria. 'This is the best place to be, honestly,' he said, gripping a gun and grinning goofily, one of his front teeth missing. 'I can only tell you that you have the best of dreams, you eat the best of food, and you are with the best of brothers and sisters who came here for the sake of Allah. If you guys only knew how much fun we have over here. This is the real Disneyland. You need to come here and join us.' The video, entitled Minnesota’s Martyrs: The Path to Paradise, was reportedly released by Islamist group al-Shabaab. The New York Times reports that the FBI's psychological analysts at Quantico in Virginia are heavily monitoring the activities of American citizens who have expressed extreme views online. Vulnerable: Community leaders say young, aimless  Americans are vulnerable to recruitment by Islamic extremist groups . Minnesota martyr: Troy Kastigar, a Native American, appeared in a recruiting video for al-Shabaab telling other Americans that fighting in Syria was 'like Disneyland' But according to Abdirizak Bihi, the director of the Somali Education and Social Advocacy Center, young women from Minneapolis's Somalian community are still being recruited to support Islamic militants in Syria. 'As recently as a week ago, a young girl was recruited along some others, and was sent to Syria and called her family from Syria a couple days ago,' he said. Minnesota, mainly in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, is home to the largest Somali community in the United States, including people who fled the long civil war in their east African country and children born in the United States. Many are now American citizens. Al-Shabaab's initial recruitment efforts began in 2007 when small groups began discussing returning home to fight Ethiopian troops who entered Somalia to prop up a weak U.N.-backed government and were seen by many Somalis as foreign invaders. The recruiters aimed their appeal at the young men's patriotic and religious ideals. Even after Ethiopians were expelled from Somalia, al-Shabab continued to target young men frustrated with life in the West, luring them with propaganda videos that glorify jihad and martyrdom. A high-quality video that began circulating last month featured what it said were three Minneapolis men who were killed in Somalia. According to Valentina Soria, a security analyst with London-based IHS Jane's, al-Shabab has increasingly focused in the past three years on the recruitment of western nationals and members of the Somali diaspora in the U.S. and Europe to offset its declining domestic support. As much of a concern as it is that young Americans are dying abroad for extremist groups, of even greater worry is that the recruits will return home and commit acts of terrorism on American soil.","Almost a dozen Minnesotans have left the state to fight alongside ISIS extremists in Syria, say officials .

"It is thought laughing Yannick Ntesa, 25, sprayed the acid and made his getaway in a red BMW . A gang who laughed as they doused a woman in acid while she walked her six-year-old twins home from school have been jailed for a total of 44 years. The attackers was heard laughing as the noxious liquid was sprayed at the screaming mother in front of her two boys outside Upton Cross Primary School in Upton Park, east London. Speaking after the attack the woman, who suffered horrendous burns to her face and body, said: 'I saw a man approach me who was carrying something in a bottle. 'He threw it over me and after a few seconds it started burning. I was crying: ""Please help me! Please help me!""' It is thought Yannick Ntesa, 25, sprayed the acid and made his getaway in a red BMW with Abdul Motin, 28, and 31-year-old Ahad Miah. The 44-year-old mother, from Plaistow, fled to a neighbour's home where water was poured over her burning clothes. Some of the acid burnt her son's satchel while another mother also suffered minor injuries in the attack on March 24, 2011. The victim was rushed to the Royal London Hospital and later transferred to a specialist burns unit in Chelmsford, Essex. She suffered 16 per cent chemical burns and is still receiving medical treatment. Following a six week trial at Blackfriars Crown Court a jury convicted Ntesa, Motno and Miah of conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm and throwing a corrosive fluid on another with intent. Motin, from Stepney, east London, was jailed for 16 years. Abdul Motin (left) was jailed for 14 years and Ahad Miah (right) was jailed for 16 years for their role in the attack . Ntesa, from Paddington, and Miah, of no fixed address, were both jailed for 14 years. No motive was given for the attack but Detective Inspector John Reynolds, of Newham CID, said: 'This was a truly shocking attack on a mother who had her two very young children with her at the time. 'It was only by chance that those children were not seriously injured. They did however suffer terrible shock from seeing their own mother so horrifically assaulted. The attackers was heard laughing as the liquid was sprayed at the screaming mother outside Upton Cross Primary School in east London . 'The victim in this case is entirely innocent but will now spend the rest of her life having to adjust to the severe disfigurement inflicted on her. 'This sentencing demonstrates just how seriously the Met police and the courts treat such incidents. Those responsible have been bought to justice and we can only hope it brings some small comfort to the victim.' Naomi Oni, 21, who worked at Stratford's Westfield Shopping Centre, spent a month in hospital after an acid attack in Dagenham, Essex, in the early hours of December 30 last year. In April a 28-year-old woman, named as Tara, had acid squirted in her face after answering the door of her home in Romford, to a stranger.","Liquid was sprayed at mother outside an east London primary school .

"Wasar Ahmed (pictured) launched a foul-mouthed racist tirade against referee Ian Fraser after he gave him a red card . An Asian amateur footballer has been sent to prison for subjecting a referee to a 20-minute racist rant as he was being sent off. Wasar Ahmed, 23, told Ian Fraser: ‘I’m going to break every white bone in your white face.’ As other players and spectators looked on in shock, Ahmed raged: ‘I’m going to burn your white house down and kill your wife and kids – I know where you live. I’m going to come and find your house.’ After the game finished, Ahmed stood near to Mr Fraser’s car and stared at him as he got in. He was arrested soon after when the referee, who has 30 years' experience in officiating at matches, went to a police station and made a formal complaint to officers and the East Lancashire Football League. Mr Fraser, 48, told police he had 'never known anything like it before, felt intimidated and was left extremely shocked.' He said he feared further trouble because of the threats. At Burnley Crown Court, jobless Ahmed, from Burnley, admitted causing racially aggravated harassment, alarm or distress and was jailed for eight weeks after a judge said referees were entitled to protection from badly behaved footballers. After the case Mr Fraser, a father-of-two, of Barrowford, Lancashire, said: 'I think this sentence has to be a deterrent to other sports people who abuse match referees and then assume they can get away with it. 'I am very thick-skinned but there was no way anyone could tolerate this - especially when someone launched into the threats he made against me and my family. 'Someone having a verbal attack at me is . normally off the cuff but this went on for so long and it was coming . from a young lad who was vile in what he was saying. I just can’t . believe he would go to such length all for a game of football. Not standing for it: Referee Ian Fraser went straight to the police and reported Wasar Ahmed . 'I have been refereeing since I was 16 and I’ve played an awful lot of football but I’ve never heard anything as bad as what he was saying. 'Referees should be respected but if people see the Premier League players swearing at referees then it cascades down to matches at amateur level likes ours.' The incident took place last December when Mr Fraser was referring a match between Daneshouse FC and Prairie Utd. Striker Ahmed, who played for Daneshouse, became angry when he felt Mr Fraser should have acted over a throw-in during the match. The referee, who was being paid £22 to referee the match, asked him for his name. But Ahmed refused and swore again instead calling him 'mother f**ker' and telling him to 'f**k off.' Scene: Prairie Playing Fields in Burnley, where referee Ian Fraser was verbally abused by footballer Ahmed . Mr Fraser, a sales manager, added: 'It was vile what was coming out of his mouth, heat of the moment stuff. 'You are meant to respect a referee and in any other sport like rugby or cricket, where referees have to be respected it happens. 'But it doesn’t seem to be the case in football and that day I wasn’t being respected especially if he was making threats to kill. 'This behaviour should not be accepted and should be stamped out from a higher level.' In court Miss Silvia Dacre, . prosecuting, said Mr Fraser had to get Ahmed’s name from his team . manager, after refusing to re-start the match until he was given it. She . said Ahmed remained on the edge of the pitch and threatened Mr Fraser . who said the game would not start again until the player was removed. Judge Graham Knowles said the attack at Prairie Playing Fields was deeply offensive and unpleasant . Ahmed later said he could not remember exactly what he said but admitted he had lost his temper. It was also revealed he was in breach of a 32 weeks suspended prison term for assault. Defence lawyer Richard Taylor said: 'The defendant doesn’t dispute that he lost it. He was upset and frustrated and says he had let his team mates down. He was very sorry and he regretted that. 'He accepts that his behaviour was very poor - but I do believe he’s learned his lesson.' Judge Graham Knowles QC told Ahmed: 'This was a quite outrageous, deeply offensive profoundly unpleasant attack on a man who was just doing his best as a referee. He and others are entitled to protection. 'This incident went on for 20 minutes or so and you had opportunities to calm down and at the very least not make things worse - but you made it worse.' Ken Inkle, chairman of the East Lancashire Football League, added: 'I can’t remember any incident like this ever taking place on the pitch in our league. Daneshouse FC have now withdrawn from the league, which was probably for the best.'","Wasar Ahmed launched the attack at referee Ian Fraser in Burnley .

"A woman lost her unborn baby after she was prescribed a powerful acne drug not  suitable for mothers-to-be. Doctors should only have given   Sarah Sharma, 27, isotretinoin after making absolutely sure that she was not pregnant. But they failed to follow simple guidelines which state she should have been on the pill for at least a month before they took a pregnancy test. Sarah Sharma (pictured with husband, Varun) had to have an abortion after acne drugs caused her unborn baby to develop with severe heart and nervous system abnormalities . Mrs Sharma (pictured with daughter Asha, four-months-old) was prescribed Roccutane by doctors at Peterborough City Hospital. She and Mr Sharma won undisclosed damages after the abortion last January . Mrs Sharma later found out that she was pregnant and was told her baby had such serious heart and nervous system abnormalities that she would not survive. The hospital has now paid  damages after admitting it did  not follow the correct procedure. Mrs Sharma was given a pregnancy test when she was prescribed the drug, but it came back negative because she was only in the very early stages of her pregnancy. The hospital should have waited a month after Mrs Sharma had been on the pill to do the test to get an accurate reading. Mrs Sharma, from Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, who named her unborn girl Indiya, said yesterday: ‘Losing Indiya was devastating but to find out after that her condition, and subsequent death, could have been prevented is almost unbearable.’ Mrs Sharma was referred to a  Peterborough hospital dermatologist after suffering for a year from bad acne on her neck and chest. The condition meant she was unable to wear many of her clothes because she only felt comfortable if her skin was fully covered up. After trying creams that did not work, she was prescribed isotretinoin. She said: ‘I was told this new drug had great results in the past. 'At our first consultation meeting we were told it was a strong drug and there were some side effects. I was told that it could be dangerous for women who were pregnant and that in men it could cause issues with mental illness. ‘I was given an oral contraceptive pill on the same day I was given the drug and they did a pregnancy test and I was told that it came back negative. 'About two weeks after I started taking it I became very sick and ill and when I went to my GP he said it was a strong drug and my body was just not agreeing with it. ‘I persevered for another week and I tried to just get on with it because they went to all this trouble to prescribe this drug to me. ‘I then decided enough was enough but then I started suffering with stomach cramps and pains.’ Mrs Sharma did a pregnancy test herself and it came back positive. She then went for a scan and discovered she was 11 weeks pregnant. When she went for her 20 week scan she was told that her baby was severely deformed. She lost Indiya a week later. Mrs Sharma’s salesman husband, Varun, 25, said: ‘We were left with nothing but broken hearts and empty arms. 'I lost all faith in the NHS the day Indiya was born sleeping.’ Before Mrs Sharma was given the drug she should have been asked to take more than one pregnancy test to ensure that she was not pregnant because it is known to be harmful to unborn babies . Mrs Sharma was told at her 20-week scan that her unborn baby was severely disabled. She had to have an abortion and the baby, Indiya, was delivered when she was 21 weeks pregnant . Peterborough City Hospital has apologised to Mr and Mrs Sharma and has reassured patients that this will not happen again . A post-mortem examination confirmed Indiya had foetal isotretinoin syndrome caused by the acne drug. Peterborough . Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust medical director John Randall said: ‘As a . result of lessons learned from this incident, our procedures have . changed so that any drug treatment will only commence following two . negative pregnancy test results taken a month apart, when women have . been using appropriate contraception in line with guidance.’ The Sharmas have since had a second daughter, Asha.","Sarah Sharma was prescribed Roccutane at Peterborough City Hospital .

"A chilling video has emerged showing the merciless execution of 14 men in Syria by a brutal group that are too extreme even for Al Qaeda. It shows the blindfolded men - some of whom appear to be just teenagers - kneeling in front of a pit at night, illuminated by torchlight. A man, horrifyingly calm, shoots the first man in the back of the head with a pistol. It is here that the video freezes, the scenes too horrible to show. The blindfolded men sit in front of the pit as the executor calmly raises his pistol . Chilling: The first man is shot in the back of the head. A further 13 die in the dirt . More shots follow in quick, methodical succession. By the end, there are 14 blood-spattered corpses in and around the mass grave. It was obtained by CNN from Syrian activists attempting to show the world the atrocities committed by Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, known as ISIS, a powerful group opposing the rule of Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad that has recently battled other opposition groups. Scroll to 3.15 to watch the disturbing footage . Their methods, including savage mass executions like this, have even drawn condemnation from Al Qaeda commanders, who have demanded the group leave the war-torn nation. ISIS fighters are reportedly mostly non-Syrian extremist Muslims who have inserted themselves into the civil war to spread their hardline Islamic beliefs. Earlier this month the mainstream Syrian Opposition Coalition released a report stating that the regime of Bashar al-Assad is working hand in hand with ISIS, reportedly the largest terrorist group in Syria. A man on the other side of the pit is callously, calmly shot. He has already listened to the death of several other men . A point by point report issued by the National Coalition of Syrian Revolution and Opposition Forces documents an active partnership between Assad and the group. The opposition says it has numerous firsthand accounts from the battlefields confirming that the regime’s forces and the Islamist extremist group act together in attacking Free Syrian Army forces and are intimately intertwined. The . Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS,is a pro Al Qaida group . jihadist group that many fear is taking an iron grip over parts of . Syria. The group was . formed in April 2013 and grew out of Al Qaeda's affiliate organisation . in Iraq. It has since become one of the main jihadist groups fighting . government forces in Syria. The . final 's' in the acronym Isis stems from the Arabic word 'al-Sham'. This can mean the Levant, Syria or even Damascus but in the context of . the global jihad it refers to the Levant. Its precise size is unknown, but it is thought to include thousands of fighters, including many foreign jihadists. Analysts . say non-Syrians constitute a majority of Isis's elite fighter corps and . are disproportionately represented in its leadership. It . took over the city of Raqqa after rebels overran the city in March . 2013. It was the first provincial capital to fall under rebel control. It . also has a presence in a number of towns close to the Turkish border in . the north of the country, and has gained a reputation for brutal rule . in the areas that it controls.Inter-rebel tension . The . group has been operating independently of other jihadist groups such as . the Nusra Front and has had a tense relationship with other rebels in . Syria. In July, a . commander of the Western-backed Free Syrian Army (FSA) was reportedly . shot dead by Isis fighters in the coastal province of Lattakia. There . were also reports of deadly clashes between the two groups in the . north-western province of Idlib. Isis also seized the northern town of . Azaz from the FSA on 18 September. There . has also been friction with other Islamists. In November 2013, ISIS was . accused of killing a prominent member of the Syrian Islamist rebel . group Ahrar al-Sham. In . the most recent sign of continuing tension, ISIS suffered losses in two . days of fighting against an alliance of other rebel forces in Aleppo . and Idlib provinces.","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"Fights started outside French town halls tonight as they came under the control of the far-right National Front for the first time following dramatic gains in local elections. Exit polls suggested that the anti-immigration and anti-Europe party had roundly beaten the governing Socialists in a number of key constituencies. 'Demonstrators are trying to get at the Front representatives and starting fights,' said a police spokesman in Frejus, the picturesque Mediterranean town which is hugely popular with British tourists. Riot police are tonight guarding the offices of David Rachline in Frejus, one of the areas where the right-wing National Front have won local elections . There are reports of fights breaking out between demonstrators following heavy defeats in the local elections for France's ruling socialists . The town of Frejus and Beziers in the south of France are now expected to sign in their first National Front mayors following the elections . Frejus and nearby Beziers are now expected to have National Front (FN) mayors sworn in, along with around five other towns, following a nationwide drubbing for President Francois Hollande's Socialists. Riot police were also out in force in other parts of the country as anti-fascist demonstrators threatened FN candidates with violence. It meant further humiliation for Mr Hollande, whose disastrous tax and spend policies have led to economic stagnation, so opening the electoral door to the FN, which is regularly accused of being racist, anti-Semitic, and anti-Muslim. David Rachline, who is expected to become the FN mayor of Frejus, is a former head of the party's youth movement, and still just 26. Mr Rachline said: 'The political establishment has failed the people - it has ruined the town and filled its pockets. 'You can't talk about a protest vote any more - the Front's scores show that people are backing its ideas.' In a deeply humiliating blow for the Socialist government, finance minister Pierre Moscovici was unseated from the town council in Valentigny in the Doubs department. In a dire night for French President Francois Hollande the conservative UMP party have also made gains, including for Roger-Emile Lombertie who was elected in Limoges . Another UMP candidate, Christian Estrosi, celebrates winning his election at campaign headquarters in Nice . Mr Moscovici, who was tasked by Mr . Hollande with leading the French economy out of recession, is deeply . unpopular with the French people. There . were also gains for the UMP conservative opposition, as Najat . Vallaud-Belkacem, the spokesman for Mr Hollande's government, said: . 'These are bad results for the Left. Disappointing.' The FN took 50.26 per cent of the vote in the northern town of Henin-Beaumont last Sunday, giving it an instant majority and meaning it already has its first mayor there. As polls closed in the two round municipal elections tonight the FN said it was on track to claim 1,200 municipal council seats. 'We have moved on to a new level,' said Ms Le Pen. 'There is now a third major political force in our country.' The Socialists only consolation they have provided Paris with its first ever female mayor. Anne Hidalgo is expected to beat her conservative rival, Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet in the French capital. Miss Hidalgo claimed 54.5 per cent of second round votes in the capital, comfortably beating her centre-Right rival, who won 45.5 per cent. Marie Le Pen, National Front president, says the party has moved 'on to a new level' Socialist President Francois Hollande is expected to announce a government reshuffle in response to dire results . The Spanish-born civil servant hailed a 'great victory' even before the full results were announced. Mr Hollande's response to the expected nationwide drubbing is said to be a major reshuffle, replacing Prime Minister Jean Marc Ayrault with Interior Minister Manuel Valls. The despairing Mr Hollande is also expected to bring his former girlfriend, Segolene Royal, back into government. This is now possible because Mr Hollande's ex-first lady, Valerie Trierweiler, who hates Ms Royal, has disappeared following the President's alleged affair with the actress Julie Gayet.","Far-right National Front has beaten governing Socialists in key elections .

"NBC has caused yet more outrage over its decision to cut a tribute for the victims of the London 2005 terrorist bombings from its Olympics Opening Ceremony coverage by explaining it wasn't tailored for the U.S. audience. A tribute song, Abide With Me by singer . Emeli Sandé, and an accompanying dance was edited out of NBC's coverage . in favour of a bland Ryan Seacrest interview with Olympic swimmer . Michael Phelps . 'Our programming is tailored for the U.S. audience,' spokesman Greg Hughes simply explained after outrage over the weekend. 'It's a tribute to [producer] Danny Boyle that it required so little editing.' The excuse comes despite the fact that the devastating attack - which killed 52 people and left many with life-changing injuries - was mourned across the globe and claimed the life of a New Yorker. Ignored: NBC has sparked outrage by cutting a tribute performance to the victims of the 2005 London terrorist bombings in its coverage of the Olympic Opening Ceremony . Cut: The moving tribute included a performance by singer Emeli Sande of Abide . With Me . Vietnamese-born Michael Matsushita had moved from the Bronx to live with his fiance in London and was killed in one of the four explosions on public transport on July 7, 2005 - attacks known as '7/7'. The latest excuse will no doubt annoy Americans, who NBC suggested would not be interested in a tribute to victims just because the tragedy did not occur in their country. 'Can you imagine the BBC opting to cut . out a tribute to 9/11 at a future Olympics held in the States because it . wasn't ""tailored for a UK audience""?' Daily Kos fumed. 'If that happened... the switchboards at BBC Broadcasting House would have blown a fuse.' The segment's choreographer and dancer Akram Khan said he was 'disheartened and disappointed' that NBC cut the entire . segment, while his director Nicholas Wolaver branded it 'disgraceful'. Victim: Michael Matsushita, who grew up in New York, was one of the 52 victims killed in the 7/7 bombings in London. He is pictured with his fiancee Rosie Cowan . Moving montage: The faces of spectators' loved ones who have passed away, including the victims of 7/7, were flashed up on big screens around the Olympic Stadium and on TV . Twitter very quickly became awash . with comments demanding to know why the broadcaster - which has exclusive rights to broadcasting in the U.S. - chose to cut out the performance. Scott . Carruthers said: 'NBC cut tribute to the 7/7 victims from . #olympicceremony coverage, shocking considering we honour the 9/11 . victims at every opportunity.' Dave . Hogg tweeted: 'NBC skilled a tribute to servicemen and the 7/7 victims . to show Seacrest interviewing Phelps. That's horrendous'. Tamsin Wood added: 'So NBC . cut out our tribute to the 7/7 victims for a stupid interview!! Rude and . disrespectful on so many levels!! #openingceremony.' NBC . is known for cutting away for small portions of the opening ceremonies . to make way for averts, but U.S. commentators say they have never . heard of it skipping a whole performance before. In an earlier statement, NBC said: 'We are live . streaming every sporting event, all 32 sports and all 302 medals… The . opening and closing ceremonies, however, are entertainment spectacles. Furious: Viewers took to Twitter to voice their disgust at NBC's decision to cut the tribute from its coverage . Angry: Many viewers were demanding to know why NBC chose to cut an entire performance . 'Our . award-winning production team will present them on a medium that best . demonstrates their grandeur and majesty, and at a time when friends and . family are able to gather together to watch, which is in prime time.' The BBC had . introduced the segment by saying: 'Ladies and gentlemen, please pause . silent for our memorial wall for friends and family who can't be here . tonight. 'The excitement of that moment in . Singapore seven years ago when England won the games was tempered the . next day with sorrow from the events of July 7 that year. A wall of . remembrance for those no longer here to share in this event.' The screens then showed a montage . of images of spectators' loved ones who have passed away, including the . late fathers of Danny Boyle, the show's director and London 2012 chief . Lord Coe. Dancers dressed in . red, representing the struggle between life and death, were picked out . by a spotlight as the powerful vocals of . Sande pierced the air with Abide With Me. This . was followed by the procession of the 204 countries taking part and the . lighting of the cauldron to signal the start of the Games. 'Horrendous': It was replaced with an interview by Ryan Seacrest (left) with swimmer Michael Phelps, who is pictured right after placing third in the men's 200m butterfly heat on Monday . It is not the only controversy surrounding a tribute at the opening ceremony, after it emerged the International Olympic Committee had declined a request to hold a moment of silence to acknowledge the 11 Israeli athletes and coaches killed by Palestinian gunmen at the Munich Olympics in 1972. NBC's . Bob Costas called the decision insensitive during an interview and . indicated he would call for his own moment of silence when Israeli . athletes marched into the Olympic Stadium on Friday. Costas' comments took his bosses by surprise. Jim Bell, executive producer of . the NBC's telecast, said this week that Costas hadn't brought it up with . him before the interview. As . the athletes marched in Friday, Costas said that IOC President Jacques . Rogge led a moment of silence for the late Israelis this week before . about 100 people at the Athlete's Village. 'Still, . for many, tonight with the world watching is the true time and place to . remember those who were lost and how and why they died,' Costas said.","Broadcaster replaced tribute with bland interview of Michael Phelps .

"Claim: Convict Mario Alessi claimed Amanda Knox did not kill Meredith Kercher . A child murderer today told a court how convicted Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito were innocent of killing a British student. Builder Mario Alessi, 51, is currently serving life for kidnapping and beating to death 18 month old Tommaso Onofri with a shovel. He was one of five prisoners due to give evidence on behalf of Knox and Sollecito, who were convicted 18 months ago of the brutal murder of Meredith Kercher, 21. She was found semi naked and with her throat cut in the bedroom of the house she shared with Knox - who is serving 26 years for the murder - and two other women. Alessi told the court how he had been approached by drifter Rudy Guede, 25, who has already been convicted of Meredith's murder while they were in a prison exercise yard at Viterbo near Rome. He said he listened as Guede told him how Knox and Sollecito were innocent of the murder, which had been in fact committed by an unidentified friend of his. Alessi said:'We were in the exercise yard and Guede approached me and said he had something to say. He wanted us to get away from the other inmates and away from the cameras. 'He said that his appeal was coming up and he didn't know whether to tell the truth or not. He said that the real version of events was different from what had been said on the TV.' Appeal: Amanda Knox, pictured in court in . Perugia today, is appealing her 26 year conviction for the murder of . Meredith Kercher, right . Fellow killer: Raffaele Sollecito, who was sentenced to 25 ears jail, sits in court in Perugia for the latest day of his appeal hearing . At this point prosecutor Giancarlo Costagliola interrupted him and told him he did not have to answer as he was under investigation for giving a false statement, to which Alessi replied he was unaware of before adding he felt ill. Following a two hour adjournment after an ambulance was called to treat him, judge Claudio Pratillo Hellman ruled that Alessi could speak and he resumed his evidence. As he spoke Knox, dressed in an ankle length floral pattern white dress and blue top listened intently, occasionally making notes or picking on points with her lawyer. Alessi said: 'Guede asked me what benefits he would get if he told the truth. He then said that he had met Meredith in a bar with some friends of his - one was called The Fat One. 'He said that one had got drunk and that he had followed Meredith home to see where she lived. A few days later he said he and this drunk friend went back to the house to see Meredith. 'They asked her if she would like to have a threesome and she had told them to leave. Rudy said he then went to the bathroom and that when he came back the scene was very different. 'He said that Meredith was on the floor, back down, and that his friend was holding her down by the arms before they swapped positions. Alessi claims Rudy Guede, who was jailed over the killing of Meredith Kercher, told him Amanda Knox was innocent of murder . 'Rudy then told me that he had put a small ivory handled knife to her throat and that it had cut her and his hands were full of blood. He said that his friend had said:'We need to finish her off or we will rot in jail.' Alessi added that Guede had told him his friend had then fled the house and he had tried to stem the blood from Meredith's wound before fleeing himself from the scene in Perugia, Italy. He added how the two had then met up in a nightclub and Guede had told him his friend had given him a bundle of cash and told him:'Now get out of Italy.' Guede - who denies Alessi's claims - . went on the run and was eventually arrested in Germany before being . extradited back to Italy in December 2007, a month after Meredith was . murdered. He was later . convicted of murder and sexual assault and given theory years before . this was reduced to appeal to 18 years and confirmed by the Italian . Supreme Court. Alessi added that while in jail . together in 2009 he and Guede were watching a news report on Knox and . Sollecito's conviction and he had said: 'Well done judge' to which they . had argued violently. Alessi . said:'I told him how could he say that when he had told me they were . innocent of murder. We had a bit of a fight about it. I had told him to . tell the truth. After that we didn't really speak again.' During . cross examination from Francesco Maresca, the Kercher family, lawyer, . Alessi was shown a picture of little Tommaso and asked: 'You are serving . life for the murder of this child. Do you recognise him ?' Mr Alessi said Rudy Guede told him that 'the real version of events is different to what has been said on TV' To which he replied:'No,' with Mr Maresca adding: 'Well we all remember him. You are also serving a sentence for sexual assault - we say you are lying.' The court then also heard from Marco Castelluccio, who is serving time for robbery and possession of a firearm, he had to give his evidence from behind a screen as he has turned informer the court heard. Surrounded by three armed guards Castelluccio said that while in prison he had also heard from Alessi what Guede had told him and that other inmates were also aware of his claims that Knox and Sollecito were innocent. The last to testify was convicted mobster Luciano Aviello, 42, who told the court his brother had carried out the murder and given him the keys to the house as well as a bloody knife to hide. Aviello said the murder had been ordered because his brother Antonio, had been promised 15,000 Euro to help steal a valuable painting that was in the house. Flanked by two prison guards Aviello, from Naples, said: 'My family doesn't work, how shall we say, legitimately so it didn't surprise me that he was asked to do this job.' He added: 'The night of November 1 I was watching TV and my brother came into the house. The sleeves of his jacket were ripped and he had deep scratches on his arms. 'There was blood on him. I saw sticking out of his pocket a piece of cloth and inside there was a closed flick knife and a set of keys. I asked him to tell me what had happened.' Aviello then described how his brother had entered the house with the keys and had been looking for the painting when they were disturbed by a woman 'wearing a dressing gown.' The flat where Meredith Kercher was found brutally murdered in Perugia, Italy, has since been put back up for rent . He added: 'My brother told me that he . had put his hand to her mouth but she had struggled. He said he got the . knife and stabbed her before they had run off. He said they had also . smashed a window to simulate a break in.' Aviello went on to describe how he . had hidden the keys and the knife and said:'There was a wall by the . house where I live. I took out a stone and put the keys and knife in . there and covered it with earth.' He added: 'Inside me I know that a . miscarriage of justice has taken place,' also adding that he had been in . the same jail as Sollecito and had told him:'I believe in your . innocence.' Under cross examination from the . prosecution it emerged that Aviello had also been convicted seven times . of defamation to which he angrily replied:'That's because all of you, . the judiciary are a clan.' Back in 2009 the court was told how DNA from Knox had been found on the handle of a 30cm kitchen knife recovered form Sollecito's kitchen and that of Meredith was on the tip. However it ha since emerged that the results were so low they would not have been admitted as evidence in any other trial and the experts are examining the methods used. As a result there is a growing unease over the safety of the conviction as the prosecution's motive has also changed several times from sex game gone wrong, to a bungled break, to a domestic row between Knox and Meredith. Meredith, from Coulsdon, Surrey, was a Leeds University student in Perugia as part of her degree course and had only been in Italy for two months before she was murdered in November 2007.",Mario Alessi recounts Rudy Guede 2009 'confession'
"Climate change could bring about the greening of Greenland by the end of the century, scientists predict. Today only four indigenous tree species grow on the island, confined to small areas in the south and three quarters of the world's most most sparsely populated country is covered by a barren ice sheet. But by the year 2100 swathes of verdant forest could be covering much of its land surface, potentially changing the landscape and making life difficult for arctic animals, according to experts. Climate change could bring about the greening of Greenland by the end of the century, scientists predict. Today only four indigenous tree species grow on the island and three quarters of Greenalnd is covered by a barren ice sheet but this could change by the end of this century, scientists warned . 'Greenland has...the potential to become a lot greener,' said lead scientist Professor Jens-Christian Svenning, from Aarhus University in Denmark. 'Forest like the coastal coniferous forests in today’s Alaska and western Canada will be able to thrive in fairly large parts of Greenland, for example, with trees like sitka spruce and lodgepole pine.' He said: 'It will provide new opportunities for the Greenlanders.' The research showed that with expected levels of warming,  a majority of 44 species of North American and European trees and bushes would be able to thrive in Greenland. Many species could already grow in small numbers in Greenland today, according to the analysis published in the journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B. While images like this one might make it seem unlikely, scientists have predicted that Trees found in Alaska and western Canada will be able to thrive in fairly large parts of Greenland, providing new business opportunities for islanders . One reason for the island’s lack of current greenery is the slow speed at which forests expand by themselves. Computer simulations show it could take more than 2,000 years for Greenland’s indigenous trees to spread to every area blessed with a suitable climate in 2100. Despite this handicap, a key species such as the Arctic dwarf birch could be established over more than 400,000 square kilometres - an area almost the size of Sweden - by the end of the century. The transformation would alter Greenland’s ecosystem, leading to the loss of Arctic animals and plants. On the other hand there could be significant commercial possibilities linked to forestry, agriculture and tourism. A species such as the dwarf birch (pictured) could be established over more than 400,000 square kilometres - an area almost the size of Sweden - by the end of the century, according to the scientists . But humans could play an active role in the greening of Greenland by helping to speed up the spread of new plant species, says Prof Svenning. 'People will often plant utility and ornamental plants where they can grow,' which he believes is in our human nature.' He said: 'Such plantings could get a huge impact on the future Greenlandic nature as a source of dissemination. This certainly has positive aspects. A warmer Greenland would also be much more vulnerable to invasive species, he added. 'If imports and planting of species will take place without any control you may get a very chaotic and Klondyke-like development,' Professor Svenning warned. If temperatures do rise as predicted and Greenland develops forests, the transformation is likely to alter the island's ecosystem, leading to the loss of Arctic animals and plants.

"Arsene Wenger could reignite interest in Real Madrid keeper Iker Casillas in January, according to reports on the continent. Current Gunners No 1 Wojciech Szczesny looked unimpressive as he shipped two goals in the 2-0 Champions League defeat at Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday night and is not currently being pushed for his place in the starting line-up. Arsenal explored a move for Casillas in the summer but decided against bringing the veteran to north London. Iker Casillas is attracting renewed interest from Arsenal ahead of the January window, according to reports . Casillas makes a sharp save in Real Madrid's 5-1 Champions League win over Basle on Tuesday night . Casillas has won his place back in the Real Madrid line-up but is the subject of derision from some fans . However, French paper Le10sport claim Wenger could be tempted to go back in for the Spain legend in the January transfer window to provide Szczesny with competition. Monaco are also keeping tabs on the situation and have the capacity to make a big money offer for Casillas, who has recently won his place back in Carlo Ancelotti's side. The Bernabeu icon was subjected to derisory whistles and boos from fans in Real's last home league match, a 2-1 defeat against city rivals Atletico Madrid. But Real supporters didn't hesitate in commending his work on Tuesday night when he was called into action against Basle and made an excellent reflex save. With rumours of Casillas's desired departure gathering speed, Real Madrid president Florentino Perez curiously chose this week to present the keeper with a memento for his 15 years service with the club. Perez presented Casillas with a replica model of famous Madrid landmark La Cibeles, a statue featuring Phrygian goddess Cybele on a chariot pulled by two lions that has stood since the 1700s. For his 15 years service at the club, Real Madrid president Florentino Perez gave Casillas a replica statue . Casillas made his first appearance for Real Madrid in 1999 . Arsenal's Wojciech Szczesny picks the ball out of the net after Ciro Immobile scored for Borussia Dortmund . Dortmund's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang keeps his feet to score after rounding Szczesny . Casillas was second-string to Diego Lopez under Ancelotti and used mostly in European matches but since Lopez's move to AC Milan in the summer, he's been in competition for the No 1 shirt with Costa Rica's Keylor Navas. Ancelotti has put his faith in Casillas for the time being. 'He (Casillas) has never lost our confidence,' Ancelotti said. 'We congratulated him ... for his anniversary with Real Madrid and we wish him the best for the future. We have the same confidence in him as always.' Wenger signed Colombian David Ospina from Nice for £3.2million in the summer, but that move is considered more as back-up for Szczesny than any sort of challenge. Although yet to appear for the Gunners, Ospina's arrival fills a void left by Lukasz Fabianski, who moved to Swansea having become fed up with being the understudy to Poland's Szczesny.

"A female pastor arrested during a peaceful protest in Ferguson last night has told of her shock as she was 'grabbed' and dragged along the ground so roughly that it tore off her vest marking her out as clergy. Speaking to MailOnline just hours after her release Pastor Rebecca Ragland recalled her ordeal and voiced her belief that anyone of conscience should stand with the protesters. She said: 'I was completely stunned. All I can tell you is what my body experienced. My mind at that point was just in shock. 'I was grabbed so hard that I fell to the ground. Then I was just being yanked and it was pretty rough. I'm hurting today.' Pastor Ragland's arrest marked the first police action to be taken against protesters following Governor Nixon's declaration of a state of emergency. Moment of arrest: This is the moment Reverend Rebecca Ragland was arrested by police. She told MailOnline it was after she was grabbed and dragged along the ground . Concerned: Reverend Ragland said she was demonstrating in Ferguson because she believed people of color are not fairly treated and that it was her duty as a Christian to stand with them . Vest: How Reverend Ragland was dressed for the demonstration. She went towards the front, she said, to de-escalate the situation but was arrested . The minister for Ferguson's Episcopal Church of the Holy Communion was one five protesters arrested for blocking a street outside the police headquarters. The handful of protesters were faced down by a line of officers in full riot gear as impatience grows in the city waiting for a Grand Jury decision on whether to indict Darren Wilson for shooting unarmed teenager Michael Brown, 18. According to Reverend Ragland the group - only numbering around 15 - blocking the road were dispersing when the St Louis County officers moved in. She said, 'I think everybody was completely shocked. We were dispersing at that point. Then they came down so I turned around and I thought, 'Well I'm a de-escalator so I need to stay at the front.' Rev Ragland is one of many local clergy who have taken to the streets in an attempt to defuse the volatile relationship between protesters and police that saw the Missouri town erupt in violence following the shooting on August 9. She was wearing a bright orange vest with the word 'Clergy' clearly printed across her back. Today she believes that far from protecting her this made her a target for officers keen to make a point ahead of the violence anticipated when the Grand Jury makes its announcement. Last night's arrest has been read as a clear message that law enforcement will come down hard on any and all protesters. She explained, 'I think it's noteworthy that they picked three people from the line. One was behind me wearing an Anonymous mask. One was at the very end and he was wearing an anonymous mask. And me.' Dragged from the front of the protest, the forty-six year old mother of two was cuffed and put in a police van along with the other arrestees. She said, 'As soon as they cuffed me they took me right back to the paddy wagon. Two men were holding my arms. They put me in a van. At this point the arresting officer spoke to me.' Rev Ragland would not recount the detail of that brief exchange other than to say that the officer 'expressed how he felt.' She does not, she said, want to 'vilify the police.' She and the other protesters were driven to a converted garage behind the police station where they were patted down and basic information taken. They were then put back in the van and transported to Clayton's Buzz Westfall Justice Center. At no point did anybody read her her rights. Once there, she recalled, 'You go from nylon handcuffs to metal cuffs when you're brought in. 'They take you inside another garage and you stand against a wall. You see a nurse then after that they take all of your possessions that are valuable or loose - jewelry and all that mess, shoe laces. Tensions: Michael Brown (left) was shot dead in August by officer Darren Wilson (right) in Ferguson, Missouri, sparking massive protests over the death. A grand jury is deciding whether to indict him . Divide: Although most demonstrations have been pro-Michael Brown some, such as this woman's protest, have been in support of Darren Wilson, the officer who shot Brown to death . Flashpoint: Ferguson is expecting more demonstrations when the grand jury ends it deliberations . Tensions: Demonstrations are already taking place in Ferguson, Missouri, with calls for Darren Wilson to be indicted by the grand jury, which meets again on Friday, over the killing of Michael Brown . 'At that point you're processed in terms of initial intake. Then you go through a numbered door and when you get to the other side it's like what I would call the bus station. It's where you do your time if you're taken in on a misdemeanor or whatever.' The pastor was fingerprinted - a process that she admitted left her feeling 'uneasy' - and has been charged with 'refusal to disperse and failure to move vehicle which is obstructing flow of traffic'. She was lucky, she said. She was released at 3am barely four hours after the arrest that so stunned her. It is not the first time that Rev Ragland has had dealings with police in Ferguson. On October 13 she was detained for nine hours before being released without charge. That encounter came during a highly controversial period during which Ferguson police adopted the 'five second rule' meaning that any protester who stopped walking for more than that time could be arrested. The practice was deemed illegal by a federal judge and County Chief of Police, John Belmar, stripped Ferguson police of their authority over protests. Yet despite her experiences Rev Ragland was anxious not to attribute blame. She said, 'The clergy want to be compassionate voices to soothe people who are so broken and hurt and to be a voice for the kind of justice that's actually going to move the polarities to a point where they can heal instead of this place where we're just shouting and hurting.' She intends to go back out along protesters following the Grand Jury's announcement because, she said, 'My role is to advocate for justice and to advocate for peace and for change in a system that has for too long needed to change. 'There is plenty of evidence to suggest that people of color are treated in a discriminatory fashion by our justice system. 'I think that that is sufficient reason for those of us of conscience to stand with the protesters. It's what Jesus would do.' Residents of Ferguson, Missouri, prepared Wednesday for a grand jury report expected soon on the fatal August shooting of an unarmed black teen by a white policeman, an event that laid bare long-simmering racial tensions in the St. Louis suburb. The shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown sparked weeks of sometimes violent protests. Many businesses have boarded up their windows as they expect another wave of demonstrations to follow the grand jury's decision, particularly if officer Darren Wilson is not charged. More than two-thirds of the residents of Ferguson are black, but its mayor, police chief and most of its police department are white. Black residents say their conflicts with the police long predate Brown's shooting. A protester in a Guy Fawkes mask stands with his hands in the air in front of police outside the Ferguson Police Department Wednesday . People await the grand jury verdict over the police slaying of an unarmed black teenager in Ferguson, Missouri . In a sign of tensions ahead of the grand jury report, a few dozen protesters gathered outside the city police station late on Wednesday in sub-freezing temperatures faced by officers in riot gear. Some protesters chanted 'Indict that cop.' Police arrested about six people when protesters tried to block the street after ignoring orders to keep it clear. The arrests were the first of protesters in about a week. On Tuesday, Missouri Governor Jay Nixon named a panel of 16 commissioners to develop solutions to the deep-seated socioeconomic disparities in and around Ferguson. Despite the tensions, some in Ferguson have tried to carry on life as usual. A crew of city workers spent Wednesday morning putting up Christmas decorations on the street that is home to the Ferguson Police Department. Activists say that will be the first place demonstrators assemble after the grand jury report. Officials have said the grand jury is expected to make its decision by the end of the month. Show of force: Police in riot gear try to break up protesters marching in the streets . The Ferguson-Florissant School District told parents on Wednesday that schools may close early or not open at all on the day the grand jury's decision comes, with the decision based on when officials learn the report is coming. Country singer Hunter Hayes, citing the state of emergency declared by the governor, canceled a concert scheduled for Thursday night at an arena on the campus of St. Louis University. Nixon has defended his decision to declare the state of emergency ahead of the grand jury's decision, a move some called heavy-handed, particularly given that protests in recent days had been peaceful. The state of emergency allows the National Guard to deploy to the St. Louis area. St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay asked for 400 National Guard troops to be deployed to his city, to work in alternating 12-hour shifts at 45 locations around the city. There are conflicting accounts of what preceded the Aug. 9 shooting of Brown, with some witnesses contending he had raised his hands in surrender and others describing a struggle between the teen and Wilson.

"A heroic soldier who survived being blown up by the Taliban twice to be awarded Britain's second-highest medal for bravery has offered it for sale at £100,000. Colour Sergeant Alan Dennis was presented with the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross - second only to the Victoria Cross - by Prince Charles for risking his life to rescue three comrades while under fire. As he dragged the third colleague to safety a rocket propelled grenade exploded 5ft in front of him, sending him flying through the air and into a ditch, breaking his arm. Scroll down for video . For sale: Colour Sergeant Alan Dennis is selling his prestigious Conspicuous Gallantry Cross (left) along with his other medals for £100,000 after he was awarded it for risking his life to save three comrades . Soldier: Sgt Dennis, pictured in Afghanistan, was on patrol in Helmand Province in 2009 when he and his fellow soldiers were ambushed by the Taliban . But the brave soldier continued firing his rifle with his good arm until help arrived. At the time of the ambush in 2009, Sgt Dennis had only just recovered from being blown up in a vehicle by a roadside bomb. He suffered a broken leg after he was catapulted 30ft in the 2007 blast which killed the British serviceman sat next to him, Drummer Thomas Wright. Now aged 40 and a married father-of-two, Sgt Dennis, from Derbyshire, has left the army and has decided to sell his CGC, along with the rest of his medals, for the 'life changing' amount of money. He said: 'I am obviously reluctant in many ways to sell my medals. 'However, the amount of money that this sale could realise is potentially life changing for myself and my family. Injured: As Sgt Dennis dragged the third colleague to safety a rocket propelled grenade exploded 5ft in front of him, sending him flying through the air and into a ditch, breaking his arm . 'As a husband and father, I have to put their welfare first and this has made the decision to auction the medals easier than it might otherwise have been.' The medal is being sold in a group along with his other military awards, including his Accumulated Campaign Service Medal, which he received in 2011, two Jubilee medals and one he was awarded for his service in Northern Ireland. Out of 58 ever awarded, Sgt Dennis' CGC is only the third to come up for auction. Sgt Dennis, who spent 20 years in the Army, served with the 2nd Battalion of the Mercian Regiment and was second in command of a patrol involving soldiers from the Afghan National Army when they were ambushed by the Taliban in a river valley in Helmand Province in 2009. Half the men broke into a nearby compound to establish a fire support position but upon doing so realised that several of the Afghan troops were still out in the open . Tough decision: Married father-of-two Sgt Dennis, has now left the army and has decided to sell his CGC for the 'life changing' amount of money . Sgt Dennis dashed out twice to help two men to safety. It has taken five years for Sgt Dennis to recover from the physical and psychological scars he suffered in the ambush attack. He left the army in September this year and has started a new job elsewhere. The citation for his CGC states: 'On the third run, he heard a 'whoosh' and turned as a rocket propelled grenade exploded three metres in front of him. 'Although the fragmentation missed him, Dennis was hurled through the air by the blast and into a ditch. For a few seconds he was unconscious and when he came to his left arm hung uselessly by his side and he was in intense pain. 'Undeterred, Dennis fought on, moving back to the fire support position where he used a radio to send a contact report.' He refused morphine as he said it would have dulled his senses or created a burden for his team and instead carried on using his rifle with his right arm. The citation continues: 'Dennis' fighting spirit when severely wounded was outstanding and inspired others. His example and initiative brought the ANA into the battle which saved the patrol from defeat.' Before being presented with his CGC at Buckingham Palace in 2010, Prince Charles - the Colonel-in-Chief to the Mercian Regiment - wrote personally to Sgt Dennis. He wrote: 'To say that I am full of admiration for your gallantry, courage and initiative is an understatement. You are an immense credit to this country of ours which is, without doubt, more fortunate than it realises in having such dedicated people as yourself serving in our armed forces.' The letter from Prince Charles is also being sold alongside Sgt Denni's medals as is an unopened bottle of Highgrove Islay Single Malt Scotch Whisky presented to him by the Royal. Pierce Noonan, of London-auctioneers Dix Noonan Webb, said: 'The Conspicuous Gallantry Cross is second only to the Victoria Cross among British combat gallantry awards. 'Just 58 have been awarded to our Armed Forces since the CGC was instituted in 1993 - a period during which our servicemen and women have been almost constantly involved in a series of major conflicts. 'That tells us how special the award is and how astonishingly brave and tenacious Colour Sergeant Dennis was when he won it.' One of the first ever CGCs, awarded to former Royal Marine Justin Thomas, from Llantwit Fadre, sold for £88,000 in September 2009. Marine Thomas, who received the medal after he single-handedly fought off more than 100 Iraqi insurgents in 2003, said he would use the money to buy a house. Another, awarded for an action in Afghanistan sold for £95,000 in 2012. The sale takes place in London on December 10. Recipient: Dipprasad Pun of the Royal Gurkha Rifles  was awarded the honour after he single-handedly defeated up to 30 Taliban insurgents . The Conspicuous Gallantry Cross (CGC) is the second highest military medal that can be awarded to members of the United Kingdom's armed forces. Presented in 'recognition of an act or acts of conspicuous gallantry during active operations against the enemy', the medal was introduced in 1993 and is second only to the Victoria Cross. It was introduced after a review of the honours system as part of a drive to remove distinctions of rank in awards for bravery, replacing both the Distinguished Conduct Medal and the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal, and can also be awarded posthumously. All ranks of the Royal Navy, British Army, and Royal Air Force can be awarded the CGC, with further medal-worthy acts of gallantry honoured with a bar which can be added to the medal. The CGC is silver and in the shape of a cross, with a laurel wreath underneath and is mounted on a white ribbon with blue and crimson stripes. A recipient's rank, name and unit are engraved on the reverse. Corporal Wayne Mills was the first gazetted recipient of the CGC. While serving with the 1st Battalion The Duke of Wellington's Regiment (West Riding) on UN Service in Bosnia in 1994, his patrol came under  fire, from a group of Bosnian Serbs. The patrol returned fire, killing two of the attackers but became vulnerable to futher attack when they reached an open clearing. Corporal Mills then  turned back into the wood and engaged the attacking group, delaying them long enough to allow the rest of his patrol to cross the clearing. Corporal Mills shot the leader of the group, causing the rest to scatter and returned to his patrol safely. Other  recipients include Dipprasad Pun, a Nepalese corporal with the Royal Gurkha Rifles who was awarded the honour after he single-handedly defeated up to 30 Taliban insurgents who were storming his control post near Babaji in Helmand province in 2010.

"Louis van Gaal has thrown down the gauntlet to midfielder Anderson who has not played since Manchester United’s goalless draw at Burnley in August. The club are prepared to write off the £18million midfielder in January but will not pay up his contract to see him go, meaning other clubs will have to match his £60,000-a-week wages, something Brazilian clubs are loathe to do. Van Gaal has said Anderson has not been fit enough for him to be considered for selection but revealed he has returned to training with the first team and has to show better stamina and energy levels on a consistent basis. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Anderson's Porto goals and skills that convinced Ferguson . Manchester United midfielder Anderson has struggled for form and fitness under Louis van Gaal . Anderson's last appearance for Manchester United came against Burnley at the end of August . The midfielder has been criticised in other quarters for his lifestyle off the pitch and has been the subject of jokes of other United players about his eating habits. Van Gaal said: ‘He’s now coming back. He was injured but he’s training now with the team. I cannot say what had happened last year but in my four months here, he’s had a lot of injuries. ‘So I cannot judge him but when he trains he trains at a good level. He’s not always fit and that is more his problem now. ‘I can’t pick him now because you have to be fit. For the first three months the culture of a trainer is fitness. That is the smallest thing you can demand. Professional league fitness. Fitness is the most important thing. First you have to show your fitness. Not for just one day but for several weeks.’ Van Gaal has revealed Anderson has returned to first team training following a number of injuries .","Anderson has not played for Manchester United since August 30 .

"Bayern Munich are keen to extend the contract of their coach Pep Guardiola, although chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge insists there is no rush.

"For most people the concept of sticking their head in an alligators jaw is the stuff of nightmares, but for one alligator handler this scary task is all in a day's work. Chris Gillette works at the Everglade Alligator Farm, where he entertains tourists by grappling with the park's gators. During his routine the daring 24-year-old hauls the gator from the swamp by its tail and leaps onto its back. Normal day at the office: Chris Gillette works as an alligator handler at the Everglade Alligator Farm, where he entertains tourists by grappling with the parks gators . Mr Gillette then prizes open the gator's jaw and rests his chin on the animal's teeth, while the park's visitors gasp in horror and amazement at his daring stunt. Some might think Mr Gillette has bitten off more than he can chew by choosing to spend his time battling with the 300lb monsters. But Mr Gillette is an expert at handling the reptiles and began working with them at various parks when he was 18, to help pay for his degree in environmental studies. All in a day's work: The park's visitors gasp in horror and amazement at his close encounters with the beasts . Prize-winning: Mr Gillette's talent for wrestling the reptiles has since landed him first prize in an alligator wrestling competition . His talent for wrestling the reptiles has since landed him first prize in an alligator wrestling competition. Mr Gillette said: 'I love alligators, they're fascinating animals and I feel very privileged to work with them. 'When I first started I wasn't scared, I loved the rush and excitement of it and didn't even think of the dangers. 'I get much more nervous doing shows now as I'm more aware of the dangers involved. 'During my show I try to get as close to getting bit without actually getting bitten, its about balancing the audiences need for excitement with your own need of safety. 'We work with some very aggressive alligators at the park and if you're not careful there's a chance they could kill you. Brave: Mr Gillette said: 'When I first started I wasn't scared, I loved the rush and excitement of it and didn't even think of the dangers' 'Our most aggressive alligator, Godzilla is extremely dangerous. If he's angry, goes into a feeding response or a death roll if he gets a hold of you, he's going to rip off your arm. 'Once the alligator locks its jaw on you there's no way of getting it off, they latch on and clamp onto you with such force there is no way to physically pry open the jaws by yourself. 'I am dicing with death, I have to be very careful. It's easy to become complacent when you're working with the alligators every day. 'But you have to remember that one of those days, that alligator could kill you. Mr Gilette explained that he had a call a very close call with Godzilla recently when he cornered him at the alligator park during a show. 'He had me against a wall and he jumped up at me and tried to bite me in the head. If he'd have got a hold me he'd have caused some serious damage and possibly even killed me. 'Luckily I jumped out of the way and his jaw slammed shut less than an inch from my skin. 'He actually grazed my shoulder with his top jaw teeth and left a nice scar to remember the moment by. Dangerous job: During his routine the daring 24-year-old hauls the gator from the swamp by its tail and leaps onto its back . 'I pulled my shirt over the wound to cover the blood, jumped onto his back, and finished the show. That was a pretty hairy moment. 'I've been bitten during a show before, I just put my hand behind my back to hide the blood and carried on. Mr Gillette said he has always had an interest in animals and grew up catching lizards, snakes and turtles. He said: 'I kept a lot of lizards and turtles when I was younger, I was always in the wild as a child. 'As soon as I got home from school I went into the woods looking for animals, I enjoyed getting up close to them and taking photographs. 'I started working with smaller alligators when I was 15 and then larger alligators when I was around 17-18. 'I guess you can say the older I've got the further I've moved up the food chain.' When Mr Gillette isn't wrestling alligators for visitors to the park, he's volunteering at animal wildlife parks. He has also spent time in the Amazon and Costa Rica to help launch breeding programmes for crocodiles and other animals. And he is hoping to do a masters in environmental studies in the near future. He said: 'I'm not just some hillbilly guy who wrestles alligators.'I'm going to be working with animals and helping wildlife for the rest of my life. 'Maybe that will be wrestling alligators for many more years to come or something else I don't know yet, but whatever it is i'm sure it will be something exciting.'","Chris Gillette, 24,  works at the Everglade Alligator Farm in Miami .

"We ought to be ashamed: Reverend Dr George Carey said the Church had failed to invest in younger generations and now risked extinction . The Church of England is just 'one generation away from extinction', the former Archbishop of Canterbury said yesterday. Lord Carey laid the blame at the feet of Church leaders who he said should be 'ashamed' of their failure to bring youngsters into their services. His stark message was echoed by the Archbishop of York, who told the General Synod that compared to the need to attract new worshippers, 'everything else is like re-arranging furniture when the house is on fire'. The Most Reverend John Sentamu told the Synod – where leaders will debate how to persuade traditionalists to accept women bishops – that they spent too long 'arguing over words and phrases, while the people of England are left floundering amid meaninglessness, anxiety and despair'. Lord Carey, who stepped down from Lambeth Palace in 2002, remains among the most high-profile campaigners for Christianity in the country. He said: 'We ought to be ashamed of ourselves. We are one generation away from extinction – if we do not invest in young people there is going to be no one in the future.' The series of high-level warnings about a looming crisis comes at a time when  Christian belief and the Church of England appear under attack on a number of fronts. Recent census figures have shown a decline of more than 10 per cent in a decade in numbers of people who call themselves Christian, and the courts have rejected a series of pleas from Christians for respect from the law for their beliefs. Last month one of the country's most senior judges delivered a further blow. President of the Family Division Sir James Munby declared the courts are not Christian and 'the days are past when the business of judges was the enforcement of morals or religious beliefs'. Ministers – who ignored the CofE's objections to same-sex marriage – have gone so far as to threaten the autonomy of the Church of England by hinting that the Government will intervene to force its hand if it cannot bring itself to approve the appointment of women bishops. Lord Carey's warning was delivered in a speech at Holy Trinity Church in Shrewsbury as part of the Shropshire Churches Conference 2013. Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, pictured here speaking at Lambeth Palace in London, said: 'The issue of how we support each other, and how we understand and confront violent attacks is certainly one of the greatest of our age' Facing decline: Members of the General Synod of the Church of England stand during a meeting at Church House in central London . The Most Reverend John Sentamu told the Synod that they spent too long 'arguing over words and phrases . 'I am convinced that churches can grow, must grow and should grow,' he told his audience. However, he said that going to church 'is not something that is natural to people in their lives nowadays'. But he added: 'There is so much violence, too many divided families, too little job security, too many young people with nothing to aim for. It is still the case that people are essentially looking for spiritual fulfilment.' The warning from Dr Sentamu came in a document – also approved by the current Archbishop of Canterbury The Most Reverend Justin Welby – that spelled out the real danger of the Church's collapse to the Synod, the CofE's parliament. Ignored youth: Lord Carey said that sitting in 'a cold church' is not interesting to young people and the church should make a bigger effort to involve them . Their paper spoke of a 'growing wariness and antipathy towards faith', adding: 'Put simply, fewer clergy are now ministering to a larger population and having to oversee a roughly similar number of buildings with fewer worshippers to pay for them. 'Further significant decline would make it impossible to maintain the Church of England as a national institution, which is present in every community.' Church of England Sunday congregations are running at half the numbers of the 1960s, and over the past two decades Roman Catholic churchgoing has seen a similar decline. Christian numbers are rising fast in some parts of the world, notably in Africa. Worldwide, the Anglican churches have between 70 and 80 million followers – many of whom look to the Church of England for a lead. However Christian churches are under pressure from Islam, particularly in West Africa, and persecution and violence in parts of the Middle East and Pakistan. 'The issue of how we support each other, and how we understand and confront violent attacks is certainly one of the greatest of our age,' Archbishop Welby said.","Lord Carey said Church of England is at risk if 'urgent' action is not taken .

"British No 1 Andy Murray hopes to marry Kim Sears next year after the former Wimbledon champion announced their engagement last week after nine years together. 'We have a plan to get married next year, that's the plan but no dates were set yet,' Murray told reporters in Manila on Sunday, where he is taking part in the new International Premier Tennis League (IPTL) team tournament. Murray has yet to win a match in the Philippines after his team, the Manila Mavericks, went down against an Indian Aces side led by Roger Federer and Ana Ivanonic on Saturday. Andy Murray is playing for Manila Mavericks in the International Premier Tennis League with Maria Sharapova . Murray plans to marry girlfriend of nine years Kim Sears after the pair recently became engaged . The world number six lost his singles match to Gael Monfils 6-4 before teaming up with Maria Sharapova for the mixed doubles, in which they stumbled to a 6-1 defeat against doubles specialists Rohan Bopanna and Sania Mirza. Murray, who also lost twice on Friday against the UAE Royals, said his team had struggled in their first matches in the tournament because 'we're not used to playing this format'. 'We're not used to being part of a team,' he added. 'It's been a good experience. We've had good fun and it's been something completely different for the players.' Sharapova and Murray enjoy themselves despite falling to a 6-1 defeat in their double set against Indian Aces . Murray and Sharapova high-five at the Mall of Asia Arena in Manila, Philippines, during their loss . Murray will return to court later on Sunday against the Singapore Slammers, a team featuring women's world No 1 Serena Williams and Andre Agassi. The 27-year-old Scot said the event in Manila hoped to draw more fans to professional tennis as some of the world's best players visited an Asian city where no ATP and WTA tournaments were currently held. 'An event like this gives tennis fans in the Philippines an opportunity to come and watch some of the best players in the world and experience live tennis in a completely different format, a fun format,' he said . Murray will be back in action on Sunday for the Mavericks against Serena Williams' Singapore Slammers . 'It will good for tennis in the long term.' Murray added that he would be spending the Christmas holidays with his family in Scotland before flying to Melbourne for the Australian Open in January. The second leg of the IPTL will be played in Singapore next week before moving on to New Delhi and Dubai.","Andy Murray got engaged to long-time girlfriend Kim Sears last week .

"A mother was ordered not to breastfeed her baby in public because she was in a ‘multicultural building’. Emma Mitchell, 32, was about to feed 19-week-old son Aaron when a receptionist at a town hall warned her to stop. Last night Mrs Mitchell condemned council staff, saying it was time people recognised the law which allows nursing mothers to breastfeed in public. Carer Emma Mitchell was told she couldn't breast-feed her five-month-old son Aaron . ‘It was just awful. I felt  humiliated, intimidated and guilty through the whole thing,’ she said. ‘What I was doing was one of the most . natural things a mother can do. You hear everywhere  that breast is . best for your baby, so why wouldn’t I be allowed to do that?’ The incident occurred when Mrs Mitchell, from Oldham, was in the Citizens’ Advice Bureau in Oldham Civic Centre. The mother of two was asking  about hiring a babysitter for her two boys when Aaron became hungry and started crying. She then asked the receptionist if . she could use a corner of  the room to feed him, but she refused, saying . it was a ‘multicultural building’. Mrs Mitchell, who is married to Neil, . 43, a lorry driver, said: ‘She then rang the manager who told me that I . couldn’t breastfeed here and to go into the shopping centre’s public . toilets instead. Ms Mitchell was visiting the Citizens' Advice Bureau at Oldham council . ‘A member of the complaints department came down and spoke to the receptionist. ‘But she then told me that I had caused an uproar. I just asked to be allowed a place to feed my crying baby.’ Michelle Booth, 38, a friend who was . at the civic centre, said: ‘I don’t understand. It’s political . correctness gone mad when they’re worried about offending people of . other cultures over something so natural.’ Under UK law, mothers can breastfeed . in public under the provision  of goods, services and facilities . section of the Sexual Discrimination Act, whatever the age of the baby, . in places such as council buildings, cafes, restaurants, libraries and . doctors’ surgeries. Last night councillor Shoab Akhtar, . of Oldham Council, said: ‘We fully support the right of mothers to . breastfeed their children and actively encourage it due to the long-term . health benefits it provides. ‘Mrs Mitchell’s disappointing . experience has highlighted the need to make all our staff fully aware of . our policy and our legal requirements. ‘Staff will be trained in the coming . days to ensure this never happens again, and we will be contacting Mrs . Mitchell to apologise. ‘Staff should make every reasonable . effort to assist a mother’s need to breastfeed, whether she requests the . use of a private room or otherwise.’",Council says it has no obligation to provide facilities but then makes embarrassing U-turn .
"In a stadium named after a Greek war general from the early 1800s, Harry Kane and Andros Townsend set about proving they were worthy leaders in Tottenham Hotspur’s attacking quartet. The Europa League has become the pair’s stomping ground and both started in the visit to the Theodoros Kolokotronis Stadium against Asteras Tripolis in Group C. That is a luxury neither has been afforded in the Premier League by Mauricio Pochettino but, with a goal apiece in Greece in this 2-1 win, they staked their claim. Andros Townsend celebrates with fellow goalscorer Harry Kane during Spurs' win against Asteras Tripolis . Tottenham winger Townsend is congratulated by team-mate Kane after scoring a first-half penalty . Townsend showed composure from the penalty spot to score past goalkeeper Tomas Kosicky . Follow all the latest #UEL action on: . Facebook: UEFAEuropaLeague . Twitter: @EuropaLeague . And at uefa.com . Townsend was named in Roy Hodgson’s 26-man England squad on Thursday for games against Slovenia and Scotland, despite playing just 108 minutes in four Premier League appearances so far this season. The attacker has not enjoyed life under Pochettino as much as he did under Andre Villas-Boas. But here in Greece, he had a point to prove to himself and his critics a year after scoring a 25-yard strike against Montenegro that all but guaranteed England would travel to Brazil for the 2014 World Cup. Nacer Chadli, Erik Lamela, Christian Eriksen and Ryan Mason remain ahead in the pecking order at White Hart Lane, but Townsend’s first goal of the season for the north London club can go a long way. In the 37th minute a penalty gave him that very chance. Immediately after Tottenham were awarded a penalty, Townsend grabbed the ball, making it painfully clear that no-one else was taking it but him. Kane leaped above Asteras Tripolis' defence to score what turned out to be the winning goal for Spurs . England international Townsend, pictured challenging Braian Lluy, impressed against the Greek outfit . A tidy finish rippled the right of the net, despite Asteras goalkeeper Tomas Kosicky diving the correct way, and the relief was there for the travelling Tottenham fans to see behind the goal. Then, Townsend turned provider as Pochettino switched him from the right side to the left, which later turned out to be a shrewd move. It may be a sign of Pochettino’s faith in Kane that the striker played as a lone forward. The Tottenham youth product isn’t always used in that sense, sometimes blending in to the attacking three behind. But, with Adebayor left behind in London, Pochettino’s apparent third-choice striker took to the stage. A fine cross by Townsend was inviting, and Kane nodded it beyond Kosicky to double the lead before half-time. This was a Tottenham attack led by two potential England stars tearing apart a team that had not been beaten at home in four months. Townsend leaps above Lluy during his side's Europa League clash against Asteras Tripolis . Kane played 77 minutes against Asteras Tripolis before being replaced by Brazilian midfielder Paulinho . Kane, absent in Hodgson’s 26-man list, must continue to battle for a Premier League place under Pochettino but his tireless efforts in Greece could prove his downfall, however. Kane is poised to lose his starting place in Sunday’s Premier League match against Stoke City after this energetic performance, despite scoring a last-minute winner against Aston Villa a week ago. The mood in Tripolis was that this was the biggest match in the Greek club’s history. Win, and Group C was tipped on its head. The feeling was mutual for Pochettino whose honeymoon period is over, having found himself under pressure for the first time since beginning his Premier League managerial career. But the Tottenham boss has now beaten Villa, saw off a pesky Asteras, and has Stoke in his sights. What a difference a week can make.

"At first glance the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge seemed uncharacteristically serious as they took in a dance performance by a charity group in London today.

Although the dress didn't quite escape unscathed from that engagement and ended up splattered with paint, it looked good as new as the Duchess mingled with crowds outside Only Connect's Pentonville Road headquarters. And the dress wasn't the only part of her outfit making a repeat appearance: her brown suede ankle boots and black clutch were also on their second outing. Both appeared with the dress during . the Oxford visit, during which the Duchess met children helped by the . charity The Art Room, of which she is a patron.

Kate wore the coat for her first public engagement as royal patron of The Art Room, which encourages confidence in disadvantaged children. The Duchess of Cambridge wore the coat to visit a school on February 22, 2012 (left) and again today (right) Orla Kiely is famed for her retro, 70s-inspired prints . And she was so keen to get stuck in that . she ended up with red paint on the sleeve of her wool jacquard coat . after taking part in a class. As soon as the duchess was spotted wearing the brown dove-patterned garment, there was an ‘absolute frenzy’ on the website, according to a the brand. The Birdie wool jacquard shirt dress was on sale for £162.50, down from £325. Sadly, for Kate fashion fans, it is no longer on sale. Kiely is an Irish contemporary designer, based in London, known for her unique retro prints and designs. She has been dubbed the 'Queen of Prints' by the fashion world. A suitable choice for the future Queen of England, perhaps. Trained in textile design, she began her career designing hats, but moved on to  handbags, clothing and a variety of other items - including kitchenware and cars.

"The breath of 40,000 worshipping Germans hung in the winter air. As did the plumes of purple-tinged grey smoke from Lewis Hamilton’s wheel-screeching, crowd-pleasing car. The world champion was in Mercedes’s heartland yesterday, a smile almost permanently worn wide. It was a night-and-day contrast to the taut bundle of tension he represented on the eve of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, where he won a second world title with a quicksilver start that belied his nerves. This event, Stars & Cars, was the stage for Mercedes to share his success, and their world constructors’ title, with the fans — the best in the world, as Hamilton describes them. Lewis Hamilton pictured celebrating after winning his second world championship title in Abu Dhabi . Hamilton  pictured driving his Mercedes Formula One car at the Stars and Cars event in Germany . Never mind that he is British, Hamilton was given a warm reception. Which is more than he got in some quarters back ‘home’ for waving the Union Flag in the air while living abroad to save on his tax bill. So will he leave his haven in Monaco and return to Britain and the clutches of Her Majesty’s revenue raisers? ‘No,’ he said, pointing to a happy lifestyle split mostly between the Mediterranean and America, the home of his pop-star girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger. ‘I always go to the States in the winter. It’s my favourite place, where I have my house. I’ll get back to Monaco and then I’ll spend some time in the UK. I’ll go and see my mum. ‘In Monaco, I wake up with quite a nice view. It’s generally beautiful weather when I wake up and I like being by the sea. ‘But, of course, I was born in Britain, so it’s always like going home. You’re going back to where you started.’ Hamilton (left) celebrating his achievements alongside his famous girlfriend, singer Nicole Scherzinger (right) Hamilton  in action during the final Formula One Grand Prix of the season in Abu Dhabi . Hamilton was clearly overwhelmed and emotional immediately after securing his second world title . The issue of nationality is a hot topic in Hamilton’s next title assault — on the BBC Sports Personality of the Year. Hamilton’s chief rival for that honour is golf’s Rory McIlroy, the winner of two majors this season and a star of the Ryder Cup. Is living in your second tax exile — Monaco after Switzerland — preferable in the public’s estimation to having cast yourself away to Ireland for the next Olympics, as McIlroy has done? The Beeb vote on December 16 will give us some clue. Next to Hamilton was his team-mate and a true national hybrid: Nico Rosberg, who was born to a Finnish father and a German mother and is domiciled in Monaco. He speaks five languages, supports Bayern Munich and competed for Finland before switching allegiance to Germany, probably for commercial reasons. Hamilton inspects the drum kit on stage at Mercedes' Stars and Cars event in Stuttgart, Germany . The British champion takes a selfie with a young fan during the annual celebration on Saturday . The two were more outwardly friendly than in recent months. ‘We were filming the other day and all the tension from the season disappeared. We can go back to being two normal individuals, talking about things that guys talk about,’ said Hamilton. Can we be so sure? This may be no more than a passing thaw. Rosberg, for all his bonhomie, must have hated moments of this party and will have revenge on his mind. ‘I have no regrets,’ he said of a season that reached its controversial peak when he and Hamilton crashed. ‘But there are a few things I would do differently. That is natural. It is often in difficult circumstances that we learn the most.’ The parade and interviews in and around the Mercedes museum was as German as Bratwurst. But there were reminders of the English connection. Nico Rosberg (left) and Hamilton (right) have had a fractious relationship over the course of the seaosn . Hamilton was sprayed in champagne after winning the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix and  the world championship . Not least in the form of Sir Stirling Moss, who drove the museum’s Mona Lisa, a silver 300 SLR. As plain Mr Moss he drove this car along 1,000 miles of open Italian road in 10 hours 7mins 48sec at an average speed of 98.98mph to win the Mille Miglia in 1955 — when Mercedes produced their last F1 world champion, Juan Manuel Fangio. The laps of honour also continue for Hamilton. He will drive his Mercedes F1 W05 Hybrid on to the FIA Gala stage in Doha on Friday to collect the champion’s trophy. He is also finalising an appearance at the Autosport Awards, when he is favourite for the international driver of the year prize, and will be at the British Racing Drivers’ Club lunch. Regardless of whether he wins the BBC gong, Stevenage’s most famous Monaco resident will collect plenty more silverware before Christmas.","Lewis Hamilton is in Germany for Stars & Cars Mercedes event .

"Hoax: Neil McArdle sparked a bomb scare to prevent his fiancee from finding out he had forgotten to book the venue . As far as his unsuspecting bride was concerned, everything was in place for their big day. But when Neil McArdle realised he had bungled the booking of his wedding, he couldn’t face breaking the news to his fiancée, Amy Williams. Instead, the panic-stricken groom took desperate measures and phoned the venue to warn there was a bomb about to go off...in the hope the distraction would prevent her from ever finding out about his mistake. McArdle, who is unemployed, stood by as Miss Williams, 29, turned up at historic St George’s Hall, Liverpool, in her wedding dress, only to find it had been evacuated and was swarming with police. Yesterday it emerged the hoax is likely to land him in jail after he pleaded guilty to making the hoax call. It is understood McArdle and Miss Williams are still together but, six months on from the incident, have still not tied the knot. McArdle said: ‘It was just a ridiculous thing I did. It might be funny to other people, but not to me. It’s wrecking my family’s life. ‘I’m still together with Amy, but she’s got high blood pressure and wants nothing to do with it.’ McArdle had planned to marry Miss Williams at Liverpool Register Office, which is situated within the listed St George’s Hall, on April 24. The date was pencilled in and the pair were given ‘right to marry’ paperwork to complete in order to legalise proceedings. But by the time the big day arrived, hapless McArdle realised he had not filled in the forms and knew the venue was not officially booked. Instead of telling the truth, he went to a phone box near his home on the morning of the wedding and rang the venue. He told the receptionist: ‘There’s a bomb in St George’s Hall and it will go off in 45 minutes’, before putting the phone down. Dozens of people inside were evacuated and bomb disposal units raced to the scene. A source said: ‘He realised he hadn’t filled this form in. But he hadn’t got the heart to tell his missus and her family.’ Evacuation: Police arrested and charged McArdle on the same day after he made the hoax call . Police inquiries resulted in McArdle, of Kirkby, Liverpool, being arrested and charged later that day. It . is understood he admitted to police that he was behind the hoax and had . been trying to have the wedding postponed to buy himself more time. McArdle . pleaded guilty to a single charge of communicating false information . with intent and will be sentenced at Liverpool Crown Court later this . month. Last night it emerged it was the second time Miss Williams had . been let down by McArdle, who also promised her a wedding 12 months . earlier, but again failed to properly plan or go through with it. A . friend said: ‘It was a terrible thing to do because it not only ruined . the day for Amy, but all the other couples who were supposed to be . getting married the same day.’","Husband-to-be warned St George's Hall, Liverpool, of the bomb .

"Harry Kane scored and Tottenham capitulated in the second half. Mauricio Pochettino must have thought it was Groundhog Day. Cruising at 2-0, Spurs produced an utterly inept second half display as Asteras Tripolis wasted a glut of clear cut chances as the Londoners were made to sweat on their three points when the game looked all but won. Pochettino had a face like thunder as he stormed off the pitch back to the dressing room after the final whistle, hardly the demeanour of a manager whose side just won. Harry Kane scored the game's decisive goal with his first half header to put Tottenham 2-0 up against Asteras Tipolis . Kane (right) is hugged by Townsend (centre) after doubling Spurs lead in Greece on Thursday night . Asteras Tripoli: Kosicky, Lluy, Sankare, Zisopoulos, Panteliadis, Usero, Munafo (Gianniotas 81), Mazza, Rolle, Tsokanis (Badibanga 60), Parra (Barrales 84). Subs: Theodoropoulos,  Fernandez, Bakasetas,  Kyriakopoulos. Booked: Sankare . Goal: Barrales 90 . Tottenham Hotspur: Vorm, Dier, Fazio, Vertonghen, Davies, Stambouli, Dembele, Townsend, Lamela (Soldado HT), Eriksen (Mason 63), Kane (Paulinho 77). Subs: McGee, Rose, Chiriches, Chadli. Booked: Mason . Sent off: Fazio . Goals: Townsend 36, Kane 42 . Referee: Javier Estrada Fernandez (Spain) And no wonder as his side threatened to throw, what should have been a routine win, away. On the plus side for the Argentine, Harry Kane scored… again. Surely, the forward will think it's personal if he doesn't start against Stoke on Sunday. What more does he have to do? He took his tally to 10 goals in this Europa League  win. His first league start of the season  against Mark Hughes' men must surely be a certainty now. Tottenham made nine changes for Thursday night's clash, with Jan Vertonghen and Christian Eriksen the only survivors from Sunday's last-gasp win over Aston Villa. That meant another chance for man-of-the-moment  Kane to persuade Pochettino that he should be the man to lead Tottenham's so far misfiring strike force. Around 300 or so hardy souls made their to the Arcadian outpost for the clash that would see Spurs take a giant step towards qualification for the next round with victory. The encounter has been billed as the biggest night in Asteras Tripolis' history. If that was the case, then it certainly didn't feel that way. The crowd, in the 7,500 capacity Theodoros Kolokotronis Stadium, were subdued. As were their team as Spurs took control of the opening 10 minutes without creating a clear-cut chance. And slowly, Asteras felt their way into proceedings, awakening from their early slumber. Giorgios Zisopoulos sent a towering header from Fernando Usero's corner just wide in the 15th minute before Ben Davies had a weak penalty appeal rejected afar a tangle with Khalifa Sankare in the box. Suddenly the home crowd started to perk up, and their team responded; Sankare flicking a header narrowly wide after Martin Rolle's well-flighted free-kick. Then Pablo Mazza missed the best chance of the opening 30 minutes, miscuing a strike from a good position 15 yards out wide of Michel Vorm's far post following good work from Juan Munafo.

But Spurs were handed a lifeline in the 36th minute when Sankare launched himself at Andros Townsend in the box. The Asteras central-defender looked to have taken at least some of the ball, but Spanish referee Javier Estrada pointed to the spot, much to Sankare's disbelief. And Townsend picked himself up to fire the resultant spot-kick past Tomas Kosicky into the top right-hand corner. The goal was exactly what Tottenham needed after a less than convincing start, and so it proved as they doubled their lead three minutes before the break. And it was the simplest of goals, too, Townsend, with the freedom of the left-hand side, firing in a pinpoint cross to allow Kane to nod home from close range for his 10th of the season. Eric Dier (left) tackles Mazza as the pair tussle for the ball during their Group C encounter . Erik Lamela (left) failed to repeat his two-goal salvo in the reverse fixture a fortnight ago against Asteras . It surely can't be long before Pochettino succumbs to supporter pressure and finally hand Kane the Premier League start he rightfully deserves. The Spurs academy graduate, however, showed his human on the stroke of half-time somehow contriving to hit the bar from a yard out following Eric Dier's low cross - though his blushes were spared by an offside flag. Tottenham were in full control, but the way they started the second period had Pochettino fuming in his technical area. Less than 30 seconds after the restart, Tasos Tsokanis fired Rolle's pass wide with just Vorm to beat.

Kane has now scored 10 goals in all competitions for Spurs this season so far following his header against Asteras . Rolle then fired wide narrowly wide from distance before Federico Fazio's dalliance on the ball caused further chaos in the Spurs box. Asteras were carving Spurs open at will, Rolle missing two guild-edged chances with just Vorm in front of him following poor defending from captain Vertonghen and Fazio. Pochettino was furious, the wounds from the way his side surrendered their 1-0 lead against Newcastle last month just eight seconds into the restart far from healed. And Asteras kept coming, Mazza firing straight at Vorm when he should really have done better before he hit the post with an excellent right-footed strike. Asteras striker Jeronimo Barrales (third left) celebrates his goal to set up a grandstand finale against Tottenham . Vorm then produced then produced two brilliant saves to first deny Zisopoulos's instinctive volley and then substitute Ziguy Badibanga's. And a night that was running smoothly ended in chaos as Fazio bundled down substitute Jeronimo Barrales in the box to gift the Greeks a penalty in the first minute of stoppage time and caused the visitors to finish the game with 10 men as the Italian saw red. Barrales slotted home the penalty to set-up a grandstand finale before Badibanga thought he clinched a dramatic draw, but his header hit the side netting when home supporters thought the ball had nestled on the other side of the post. And breathe, Spurs fans.

"Over 250 dolphins are being held captive in a cove on the coast of Japan, waiting for either a life in captivity, or slaughter. The bottlenose dolphins, including one young and very rare albino dolphin worth millions, will be kept until the brutal selection process of the aquarium industry begins on January 18. Those that aren't taken to perform in shows will either face death by spear, or a gory corral back into the sea with their community much thinner and a lot weaker. Scroll down for videos . The pod of dolphins being held captive in the cove on the coast of Japan . Harsh conditions: These poles are deployed above the water, and then the fishermen hit a flange on the top of the poles with a hammer, creating a cacophony that drives the dolphins back out to sea . Annual process: The fishing crew are pictured transferring several dolphins into the 250-strong pod . Rounded up: The dolphins were forced to wait in the pen for 19 hours until the holding reached critical mass . The cove in Taiji on the south-west coast of Japan was made famous in the Academy Award-winning film The Cove, which documented the entire process from capture, to selection, to aftermath. Within the captured pod there is a young albino bottlenose dolphin, who is likely to be kidnapped by the aquariums. Albino bottlenose dolphins are extremely rare, and are worth considerable money to marine parks as spectator items and entertainment. The marine parks in Japan are modeled after the U.S. aquarium industry that make millions of dollars using dolphins for extremely popular aquatic acrobatic shows. Tradition: Each year the fishermen capture and kill a huge amount of dolphins, putting the population at risk . Did she kill herself? There is speculation that the mother of this albino dolphin trapped by Japanese fishermen in a cove has committed suicide after being torn apart from her baby . One of the crusaders from Sea Sheperd, who hope to bring the dolphin's plight to light (left). The fishermen preparing their nets to capture the next pod of dolphins (right) The albino dolphin is one of the rarest from this current batch of captured bottlenoses . If the dolphins that escape captivity are not killed, they are 'driven' back to the open ocean by 'banger boats' that force them to travel out to sea using long poles attached to the sides of the boat. These poles are deployed above the water, and then the fishermen hit a flange on the top of the poles with a hammer, creating a cacophony that drives the dolphins back out to sea. This is the same tactic that the fisherman use to push the dolphins into the cove and capture them. Heavy machinery: Fishermen hoist a dolphin out of the sea, on its way to either lifetime captivity or death . Boat: 'Banger boats' use poles and flanges to make unpleasant sounds, driving the dolphins to specific places . Preparation: Fishermen and trainers  unload the orange nets yesterday - just 24 hours before decision day . (Left) the fishermen are for the most part, a selection of fishermen from the Ishana Fishermen's Union. (Right) one of the dolphin fences inside the cove that allows the fishermen to stand watch . Those driven back to sea will likely be very young, and will not have the guidance of the elders that have been killed or captured, making them very unlikely to survive. Because the process is being repeated every year, entire communities of migratory dolphins along the coast of japan are being destroyed. The capturing and killing of the dolphins is mostly carried out by the Isana Fishermen's union, who are being fought relentlessly by the Sea Shepher Conservation Society Cove Guardians. The dolphins will be uncomfortably oblivious of the impending doom some of them will suffer at the hands of the fishermen. They are captured around four to five at a time until enough of them are collected for 'selection' Treatment: The fishermen brutally kill the dolphins they do not set free or capture using a sharp spike or spear . Cramped: The cove does not provide much space for the dolphins to swim, forcing them to huddle up in groups .","250 dolphins being held captive, waiting for slaughter by spike or captivity .

"An cult member has been charged with murder, rape, sodomy and incest after a 15-month-old girl he fathered with his daughter starved to death. Calvin Mcintosh, 44, was arrested after he brought Alcenti Mcintosh's neglected and abused body into a hospital in Gwinnett County, Georgia. Police then searched his room at the Extended Stay Hotel in Peachtree Corners and found three other children, two aged three and one aged five, and her 23-year-old daughter Najlaa Mcintosh - who the suspect also fathered two children with. Iasia Sweeting, 21, a mother of two of McIntosh's children including Alcenti, was also discovered on the floor of the hotel covered in blankets and in 'desperate need of medical attention', according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.  Sweeting was emaciated and weighed a shocking 59 pounds. Horror: Calvin Mcintosh, 44, (right) and his daughter Najilaa, 23, (right) have been charged with multiple offences including murder after a 15-month-old child was found starved to death in Gwinnett County, Georgia. The pair have two children together . McIntosh is said to have ordered Najilaa to deprive the children and Iasia of food if they were disobedient. She has also been charged with multiple offences including murder. During their search, investigators found notes about the Nuwaubian Nation of Moors, an Islam-based cult which mixes ideas of black supremacy with worship of Egyptians and the pyramids. Members also suggest that white people are the devil. Following the horrific discovery, Cpl. Edwin Ritter from Gwinnett County police said in a statement: 'The infant … was determined to be dead on arrival.' 'Due to the physical appearance of Alcenti, it was quickly determined by medical personnel that this was most likely a case of neglect and abuse.' Starved: Police then searched his room at the Extended Stay Hotel and found three other children, two aged three and one aged five, and her 23-year-old daughter Najlaa Mcintosh - who the suspect also fathered two children with . Mcintosh was arrested on multiple charges, including one count of felony murder, one count of malice murder, four counts of cruelty to children in the first degree, one count of cruelty to children in the second degree, one count of cruelty to a physically disabled adult, one count of rape, one count of incest and one count of aggravated sodomy. Najlaa Mcintosh was charged with one count of felony murder, one count of malice murder, four counts of cruelty to children in the first degree, one count of cruelty to children in the second degree and one count of cruelty to a physically disabled adult. Calvin and Najlaa Mcintosh are in the Gwinnett County jail. The three children found in the hotel are in the custody of the Division of Family and Children Services. Sweeting remains in serious condition at Gwinnett Medical Center. The cult's leader and founder Dwight York is currently serving a 135-year prison sentence for a string of child molestation charges and racketeering . According to the Southern Poverty Law Center the Nuwaubian Nation of Moors, or Nuwaubianism, is  movement that follows a bizarre theology. It mixes black supremacist ideas with worship of the Egyptians and their pyramids and adheres to strange beliefs involving UFOs, the Illuminati and Bilderbergers. Their leader and founder Dwight York is currently serving a 135-year prison sentence for a string of child molestation charges and racketeering. He trafficked children as young as four across the country primarily so they could be sexually exploited. York was arrested after he had his followers build two pyramids build two pyramids out of wood and stucco and other Egyptian-style buildings on the compound, which they called 'Tama-Re.' Most of the Nuwaubians at Tama-Re lived in cheap trailers, while York lived in a mansion on the property. As many as 400 other Nuwaubians lived in the surrounding area. He once said in a speech: 'White people are the devil. They say the Nuwaubians are not racist – bullcrap! I am…White people are devils — always was, always will be.' He is currently serving his sentence in the United States Penitentiary Administrative Maximum Facility (ADX) in Florence, Colorado.

"Scientists have undermined a central plank of the anti-fracking lobby’s case by showing that the controversial drilling process does not poison drinking water. Vociferous protesters against hydraulic fracturing in Britain base much of their opposition on claims that the process poses an environmental danger. Fracking involves injecting water, sand and chemicals at high pressure into shale rock deep underground, releasing rich deposits of oil and natural gas trapped inside. It has transformed the US energy industry. Scientists claim that there is no evidence that fracking has caused contamination of water sources . But green campaigners in Britain have brandished reports from America saying that methane from the drilling has frequently contaminated groundwater supplies. Now, however, a study by researchers at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, shows that the contamination in these highly publicised cases was not due to the fracking but to leaky drilling wells. The distinction is crucial, say industry experts, because it means that the environmental risks of fracking can be pretty much eliminated by ensuring the well is properly sealed with concrete and that there are no leaks in the steel pipes used to take the gas to the surface. A separate report by the US government, published yesterday, provided further gloom for anti-fracking campaigners in the UK. The study at a Pennsylvania gas well found that the chemical-laced fluids used to free gas stayed about 5,000ft below drinking water supplies. In the Duke study, researchers analysed 131 drinking water wells in Pennsylvania and Texas that had been contaminated by methane and other toxic gases. However, there is strong opposition to the introduction of fracking in Britain despite scientific safety studies . They found no evidence that fracturing shale led to the water contamination and said their findings are also likely to apply to thousands more wells across the country. Dr Thomas Darrah, one of the study’s authors, said: ‘In all cases, it basically showed well integrity was the problem. The good news is, improvements in well integrity can probably eliminate most of the environmental problems with gas leaks.’ Professor Avner Vengosh, who also worked on the study, said they could ‘say categorically’ that they had not seen gas escaping from the drilled shale rock and getting into aquifers [rock containing water]. Natural gas on its own is not poisonous but in high concentrations it can lead to explosions and fires.","US researchers claim that fracking does not contaminate water sources .

"A man was arrested this morning for the Tulsa Good Friday shooting rampage after he randomly gunned down five black victims on the second anniversary of his father's death at the hands of an African American, according to police. Jake England, 19, and his friend and alleged accomplice Alvin Watts, 32, both white, face murder charges over the shootings in Tulsa, Oklahoma that killed three and left two wounded. On Thursday, two years after Carl England was killed, Jake England took to Facebook to rage about the 'f****** n*****' who shot his father to death. Later that night, England and Watts drove through black neighborhoods in northern Tulsa in a white pickup truck and gunned down five strangers near the spot where England's father died, according to police. The attacks terrorized the black community and African-American leaders in Tulsa called the crimes racially-motivated. Charged: Jake England, 19, (left) and Alvin Watts, 32, (right) are charged with murdering three people and wounding two others in a series of random shootings that allegedly targeted black people . Racist tirade: The day before the Good Friday shootings, Jake England against the 'f****** n*****' who shot and killed his father Carl England . Thursday afternoon, England wrote on his Facebook wall: 'Today is two years that my dad has been gone shot by a f****** n****** it's hard not to go off.' He also mentioned Sheran Wilde, 24, his girlfriend and the mother of his young son, who died in January. 'between that and sheran I'm gone in the head. RIP. Dad and sheran I. Love and miss u. I think about both of u every second of the day,' he wrote on his public Facebook profile. The Facebook page had been taken down by Sunday afternoon. Acting on an anonymous tip and backed . by a helicopter, police arrested Jake England and Alvin Watts at about 2am Sunday at a home in Turley, just north of Tulsa. The two men . were roommates, and officers went to their home, then followed them . several blocks to another home, where they were arrested without . incident, police said. Authorities said they planned to . charge them with murder and other offenses. Task force commander Maj. Walter Evans said that investigators recovered a weapon but that it was . not clear who fired the shots. They also found a truck that had been . burned. Racially motivated: Tulsa NCAAP president Rev Warren Blakney Sr said the shooters appeared to be clearly targeted black people . Gunned down: Carl England was killed by an ex-convict after a fight at his daughter's apartment complex April 5, 2010 . A family friend, Susan Sevenstar, . said that England was 'a good kid' and 'a good, hard worker,' who 'was . not in his right mind""'after losing his father and the January suicide . of his fiancee, with whom he'd recently had a baby. 'If anybody is trying to say this is a . racial situation, they've got things confused,' said SMs evenstar, who . described England as Cherokee Indian. 'He didn't care what your color . was. It wasn't a racist thing.' The Tulsa World reported that . England's father, Carl, was shot in the chest during a scuffle with a . man who had tried to break into his daughter's apartment. Convict: Pernell Jefferson, 40, is serving six years in prison for crimes related to the killing of Jake England's father, Carl . On April 5, 2010, Carl England, 47, . showed up at the apartment complex where his daughter lived with her . boyfriend. The boyfriend had gotten into a fight Pernell Jefferson, 40, . and had hit him with a baseball bat, the Tulsa World reported at the . time. Jefferson, who had been in prison on . drug and weapons charges, then tried to break into the couple's . apartment but left, saying he planned to 'settle the dispute.' England . and his daughter's boyfriend went looking for Jefferson at the . apartment complex. When the found him, England hit him with a stick and . knocked him to the ground. Jefferson pulled out a gun and shot England in the chest, the World reported, killing him. Jefferson, who is black, was arrested the next day when he showed up at a hospital. He was convicted of pointing a firearm. He is serving a six year prison sentence in the shooting. Carl England was killed at 3608 N. Quaker Ave. in northern Tulsa. All of the Good Friday shootings occurred within four miles of the apartment complex where he died. Most were much closer. The shootings come at a fraught moment for black Americans. In late . February, an unarmed black teen, Trayvon Martin, was fatally shot by a . neighborhood watch volunteer in Sanford, Fla., raising questions about . racial profiling and touching off protests across the nation. Black community leaders held a meeting on Friday night to calm unrest and promote safety. NAACP Tulsa president, the Rev. Warren . Blakney Sr., told the World that the shooter appeared to be 'targeting . black people to shoot.' 'I'm on edge for my people,' Blakney said as he argued that the crime was clearly racially motivated. Close proximity: The five shooting victims were found at four locations within four miles of the apartment complex where Jake England's father was killed two years ago . Troubled: Jake England (left) made posts on his Facebook page that showed he struggled with the deaths of his father and of the mother of his young son. His friend, Watts, is also his accomplice, according to police . 'When there are reports that someone systematically shot black folk, what is one left to believe?' he told reporters. On Saturday, police chief Chuck Jordan . described the shootings as 'vicious and cowardly' as he warned the . gunmen: 'We're coming for you.' Police have confirmed whether the . shootings were racially-motivated. However, a special task force and the . FBI have begun investigating the crimes. England's . Facebook wall posts show a troubled, angry young man struggling to . raise his young son and cope with the loss of his father and his . girlfriend. After the . shootings, he wrote: 'People talking s*** on me for some s*** I didn't . do... I do believer (sic) it just mite be the time to call it quits... if something does happen tonite be ready for another funeral later.' Four shooting victims were found in yards and the fifth in a street. Police identified those killed as Dannaer Fields, 49, Bobby Clark, 54, and William Allen, 31. Police Chief Chuck Jordan said the gunmen appeared to have chosen their victims at random. Fields was found wounded about 1am Friday, Clarke was found in a street about an hour later, and Allen was discovered in the yard of a funeral home about 8.30am. Minutes after Fields was found, police found two men with gunshot wounds in another yard two blocks away. They were taken to hospitals in critical condition but expected to survive, police said. Their names have not been released. Crime scene: William Allen, 31, was found in the yard of this funeral home many hours after he was gunned down. His wife says he was walking home from his brother's house . Police are waiting for the results of forensic . tests to determine scientific links between the shootings. Police Capt. Steve Odom said in his . 30 years with the police department, he'd never seen so many shootings . happen in such a short time. Walker said detectives interviewed people Friday afternoon in the neighborhoods where the shootings happened and believe a white man driving a white pickup truck may have been involved. At least one victim said a shooter stopped his target to ask for directions before opening fire. Allen, who was walking home from his brother's house, had narrowly avoided death once, when he was badly injured in a car crash. His family never expected his life to end violently. 'Why? Why did this happen? What was the reason? What was the motive?"" his wife Jeanette, asked the World. 'He was sweet, caring... my lover. He always tried to make people laugh.' Tulsa City Councilor Jack Henderson urged people to be cautious but not let 'some crazy, deranged person mess up their weekend.' 'There's no need to become a vigilante,' Henderson said, adding that he has been assured police are working on the case as a '24/7 round-the-clock deal.'","Jake England, 19, and Alvin Watts, 32, both white, arrested 48 hours after the Good Friday shootings .

"They are well known for their shocking adverts with some of the world's most famous people posing naked to help boost their animal rights message. But this time PETA may have gone too far with its latest campaign, which suggests those who swim or fish in waters containing sharks are attacked or killed as 'payback'. The new poster shows a shark eating a severed human leg and the blood-stained slogan 'Payback is Hell', which aims to shock people into turning vegan. Controversial: The PETA advertisement may upset many whose loved ones have been hurt or killed in shark attacks . PETA say that in particular they hope . it will make people rethink fishing, suggesting if people inflict pain . on sealife they deserve it themselves. This could be considered particularly . offensive as British man Michael Cohen was yesterday left fighting for . his life after he was attacked by a great white shark while swimming in . the sea near Cape Town, South Africa. It could also be seen as an affront to . the family of British honeymooner Ian Redmond who was attacked and . killed as he went snorkelling yards off a Seychelles beach in August. The newly married Mr Redmond, from . Skelmersdale, Lancashire, had enjoyed a honeymoon lunch with his new . wife Gemma before the couple headed to the Anse Lazio beach in the . Seychelles. But tragedy struck when Mr Redmond was attacked while swimming in relatively shallow waters around 20 yard from shore. He lost an arm and suffered horrendous injuries to his left leg, as well as bite marks on his torso and hips. Holidaymakers tried desperately to . save him as he lay bleeding on the beach while others kept Mrs Redmond . back to spare her the horror of his injuries. Tragedy: Smiling newlyweds Ian Redmond 30, and Gemma Houghton 27 before the shark attack that killed Mr Redmond . Jeanne Vargiolu, 56, the owner of Le . Chevalier restaurant on the beach, said Mrs Redmond was saying she . ‘still had hope’ for her husband as he lay on the beach. ‘I saw his wife talking to about five people, I think one was English, that she still had hope he was still alive,’ she said. Speaking last month, 27-year-old . primary school teacher Mrs Redmond, who during the drama refused to . believe her husband was dead, paid tribute to Mr Redmond. She spoke movingly of the man who had been her partner for nine years and husband for a mere ten days. ‘My husband and my best friend was . tragically killed’ she said. ‘I loved him so much and he was a very . special husband, a thoughtful son and a devoted brother. ‘He worked tirelessly to give us both a . wonderful married life and home and I want to thank him for nine years . of joy. We were having so much fun and we were so excited about our . future together. 'Myself, our families and our friends . are devastated and shocked by what has happened. The loss of Ian has . left a gaping hole in our hearts that will never be filled. All smiles: Ian Redmond and Gemma Houghton on their wedding day on August 7, before they flew to the Seychelles for their honeymoon . ‘He was always calm and collected, . strong and brave, witty and intelligent, handsome and caring, a . remarkable individual who will be deeply and sorely missed.' In the South Africa attack on Tuesday . 43-year-old Mr Cohen was bitten 'numerous times' by a ten-foot-long . shark, which ripped off the lower part of his right leg and part of his . left foot. Despite his injuries the man managed . to drag himself onto the beach, from where he was rushed to hospital. He . was yesterday in a critical condition. The attack happened in the Cape Town . suburb of Fish Hoek: an area that is notorious for sharks, especially at . this time of year when they are known to be more numerous and more . likely to attack. Meanwhile last weekend, Charles 'CJ' Wickersham was spearfishing with friends in the Gulf of Mexico when a . 9ft bull shark bit him in the left leg. It tore so hard that his thigh bone was exposed beneath a 15in gash. PETA have wished the victim well, but say this is an example of the 'payback' the poster campaign highlights. Mr Wickersham, 21, only survived because six of his friends dashed into the water and pulled him to safety. Honeymoon destination: Anse Lazio beach in the Seychelles, where Ian Redmond was attacked last month . Connor Bystrom, who was in the boat . with Wickersham, told Good Morning America: 'All of a sudden he started . screaming and we knew it wasn’t good. 'Within seconds there was just a pool of blood around him.' PETA activist Ashely Byrne said: 'It . may be an unusual way to get the message across, but I think it will . cause people to be more sensitive towards fish. 'We are certainly glad the man is . going to be alright, but we hope he and other fishermen will use this as . an opportunity to rethink fishing.' PETA wants the illustration placed on billboards and benches around Anna Maria. Lucky escape: Friends gather round Charles Wickersham as he's treated in hospital, but PETA consider his attack 'payback' A photo snapped by his pals before the terrifying attack on Charles Wickersham in the Gulf of Mexico last week . But Mayor Michael Selby says that won't happen. Mr Selby said: 'We have no billboards in the city, and we do not allow advertising on our trolley benches.' One angler says this is PETA's 'typical propaganda.' Shark angler Bill Goldschmitt said: 'If I see one of those billboards that they plan on putting up, I will burn it down.' 'This is a human we are talking . about.  A lot of these animal rights activists look at the things being . done to animals and don't seem to recognize what is being done to . humans.' PETA officials say this is not the first time they have tried to install signs after a shark attack on a human. A group of surfers helped rescued what is believed to be a young great white . shark over the weekend. The baby shark washed ashore near the . Venice Pier, a popular fishing spot, Saturday with a fish hook in its mouth. Surfers in the area came to the shark's . rescue, removing the hook from its mouth and dragging it back into the ocean. A . bystander caught the rescue on tape. It is unknown if the shark survived. Scientists say the shores off the southern . California coast are populated with young great white sharks who feed on area . marine life.","Ian Redmond was killed by a shark in the Seychelles just last month .
