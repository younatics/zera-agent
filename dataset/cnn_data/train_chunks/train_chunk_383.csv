"Mohsen Makhmalbaf, one of Iran's most high-profile film directors, has been on the move for six and a half years. He left Iran in 2005 to avoid restrictions on his film-making and has since moved to Afghanistan, Tajikstan, India, Paris and finally London. Makhmalbaf's films include the 2001 film ""Kandahar,"" which won an award at the Cannes Film Festival and was listed by Time magazine as one of the 100 best movies ever.  He has won more than a dozen international awards for his films. He said he left Afghanistan because of an attempt on his life by the Iranian government and has since received threats in other cities. ""I moved from Iran about six and a half years ago to make more films because at that time the Iranian government doesn't let me make more films in Iran. ""I went to Afghanistan with my family we made some films there. Then the Iranian government sent a terrorist group to make an explosion bomb there, one of our group was killed and more than 20 injured. ""We moved from Afghanistan, to Tajikistan, India, then Paris, then London like refugees, like nomads to try to save our lives and try to make more films."" Leaving his country, Makhmalbaf said, was the price for continuing to make films, but it was a decision he did not take lightly. He said: ""When we are out of our country somehow we become a little depressed, we lose our root in our culture but we will find something more. We could see our nation from outside from different angles. ""Being out of Iran, out of the Middle East, is not easy for me really because I belong to that part of the earth. But how can we do it when in Iran we should (would) be in prison, they will torture us, when we are even in Afghanistan they try to kill us? They didn't let us make more films, they censored all the books that I wrote, so we come out to do something."" Makhmalbaf was jailed at the age of 17 for his political activism. At the time, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran, was in power. He went into exile in 1979 and Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini was instated as the Supreme Leader of Iran, which soon after was renamed the Islamic Republic of Iran. ""When I was 17  I was against the Iranian regime because he (it) was a dictator(ship),"" he said. ""I was ready to die for my country; for freedom. Still I am in the same mood but in a different age and in a different way. In that time I tried to have a gun to kill the king (Shah), but when the revolution happened the situation became worse than it was before. ""I try to use my art, my cinema like a mirror, to put it in front of society to show people to themselves to correct them. Dictatorship has a root in our culture, in our religion, in our history."" Film-making is a family business. Makhmalbaf's wife Marziyeh, son Maysem and daughters Hana and Samira are also respected names in the industry and together they run Makhmalbaf Film House. Samira's film ""Blackboards"" won the Cannes Jury Prize, while Hana had to flee Iran while shooting her film ""Green Days"" amid protests during the Iranian elections two years ago. Makhmalbaf, 54, said it was not his idea for his children  to follow in his footsteps. ""I haven't encouraged them,"" he said. ""They love cinema. They were searching for meaning for their life. They were asking me: If we go to ordinary school, if we follow the same level that everybody has, it has no meaning for us."" Hana said of conventional education in Iran: ""They were talking to me about how to wear a scarf and if my hand shows up I will go to the hell, and everything about religion. ""But in my father's school they were talking about art, about cinema. I loved the things that my father was teaching."" Makhmalbaf said he has been in contact with fellow Iranian film director Jafaar Panahi, winner of the  ""Golden Lion"" prize at the Venice Film Festival for his 2000 film ""Dayareh"" or ""Circle,"" who was jailed for six years in 2010. Amnesty International said Panahi also received a 20-year ban on all his artistic activities, including film-making, writing scripts, traveling abroad and speaking with media. Makhmalbaf  said: ""The government is going to put him for six years in prison to announce to the other artists look at Jafaar: 'If you are famous like Jafaar we put you under pressure.' It is an example for (the) Iranian government."" He added that many artists were put under pressure or jailed in Iran. ""Most of them could not work there, but say, 'If I come out I would become depressed, I would become homesick, I don't want to leave (the) country even if I couldn't work in the country,"" said Makhmalbaf. Despite the difficulties he is optimistic for the future of his country. He said: ""This generation are more educated than my generation. The have access to the internet, to media. They have (a) connection with other young generation of the world, through Facebook or something else. ""I think they know what they want. Only I ask them continue, don't stop, don't be afraid. Success is very close to us, sometimes you need to open the door and you have your freedom.""","Makhmalbaf  has won more than a dozen awards for his films .

"A 17-year-old soccer player in Utah pleaded guilty Monday to homicide by assault in the death of referee Ricardo Portillo, an official said. A judge ordered the teenager, who has not been named publicly, to keep a picture of Portillo in his cell for the remainder of his time in juvenile jail. The judge recommended a sentence of three years, said Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill. Is teen violence out of control? In addition, the judge ordered the teen to write weekly letters to Portillo's family members, telling them what steps he is taking to return to normal life. On April 27, Portillo, 46, was refereeing a game of Fut International, a Hispanic soccer league for children between ages 5 and 17, in the Salt Lake City suburb of Taylorsville. He cited a player for an infraction and issued him a cautionary ""yellow card."" A second infraction would result in the player's ejection from the game. Slain referee risked violence for 'his passion' The 17-year-old player, police said, turned around and punched Portillo in the face. At first, authorities thought Portillo suffered only minor injuries. But at the hospital, doctors discovered serious internal head injuries. For seven days he remained in critical condition. He later died from his injuries. Portillo had three daughters and three grandchildren, who live in Mexico. He moved to the United States 16 years ago. ""I just need time to heal. It's a lot of pain that this kid caused my whole family, especially my sisters and I,"" Johana Portillo, his daughter, told CNN in May. ""I will forgive this kid because it's only in God's hands. ... But right now, it's too soon for me to forgive."" Soccer violence: referees under siege .","Teenager pleaded guilty in the death of referee Ricardo Portillo .

"Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Martin Dempsey sent White House and Pentagon officials scrambling on Tuesday, insisting that the chief military officer's comments on Capitol Hill don't contradict President Barack Obama's pledge to ""not get dragged into another ground war in Iraq"" and not put American ""boots on the ground."" The uproar started after Dempsey said that if ISIS retakes the strategically important Mosul Dam in Iraq, he would recommend that some of the 1,700 American forces currently in Iraq could move to the front lines to advise Iraqi troops trying to get the dam back. Those troops would then be advisers in a combat role. ""If we reach the point where I believe our advisers should accompany Iraqi troops on attacks against specific (ISIS) targets, I will recommend that to the President,"" Dempsey said during a Senate hearing on Tuesday. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Dempsey was just responding to a hypothetical situation. The policy -- no boots on the ground -- remains. ""It's the responsibility of the President's military advisers to plan and consider all the wide range of contingencies,"" said Earnest. ""It's also the responsibility of the Commander-in-Chief to set out a clear policy.  And the President has been clear about what that policy is.  He reiterated it on a number of occasions ... the President does not believe that it would be in the best interest of our national security to deploy American ground troops in a combat role in Iraq and Syria.  That policy has not changed."" House leaders lobby wavering colleagues ahead of ISIS vote . So what's the difference? If 1,700 American forces are already on the ground in Iraq why aren't they considered ""boots on the ground""? For starters, those 1,700 Americans aren't currently the ""close combat advisers"" that Dempsey said he could recommend. Today, advisers aren't supposed to be near combat. ""He wasn't talking about specific troops in a combat role on the ground, more advising and assisting at a lower level,"" Rear Adm. John Kirby told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. Dempsey also made it clear that  U.S. military advisers on the ground are currently in a ""combat advisory role"" and ""not participating in direct combat -- and there is ""no intention for them to do so."" But U.S. soldiers are always combat-ready, Dempsey said. ""That's all we grow. We -- when we bring a young man or woman in the military, they come in to be a combat soldier or a combat Marine ... we don't bring them in to be anything other than combat capable,"" Dempsey said. Retired Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling said he read Obama's pledge not to put ""boots on the ground"" as ensuring no ""large formations of Americans"" would enter combat. ""I don't see Gen. Dempsey -- who I know pretty well -- contradicting the President at all,"" Hertling told CNN. Another beheading. What's the world going to do about ISIS? But if Obama were to approve putting military advisers in ""close combat roles,"" the risk of American casualties would increase -- regardless of whether those troops are firing weapons themselves or advising Iraqi forces who are. That's because a combat support role can turn into combat ""in a heartbeat,"" retired Gen. James ""Spider"" Marks said. ""Enemy advances are not distinctive, you could suddenly be in the midst of a really hairy dogfight and you think you're just refueling trucks,"" Marks said. Ultimately the distinction between boots on the ground and troops in advisory roles is semantic, retired Lt. Col. Rick Francona said on CNN. ""Right now we've got young American men and women putting their lives on the line dropping bombs,"" Francona said. ""We've got people in combat, I think we should just say that."" And Dempsey produced a quick and direct response when Sen. Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, asked Dempsey whether U.S. pilots dropping bombs over Iraq are in a combat mission and whether the U.S. would ""put boots on the ground"" to rescue a downed pilot. ""Yes and yes,"" Dempsey confirmed. Inhofe also lasered in on Obama's ""boots on the ground"" distinction later Tuesday in an interview with CNN. ""The President's just flat not telling the truth. We already have boots on the ground there,"" said Inhofe, a chief political antagonist of the White House. ""He knows we're going to have to have boots on the ground. Let's just go ahead and face it and admit we're in a war and you just don't win a war unless you're out there fighting."" Who is doing what in the coalition battle against ISIS? While Dempsey insisted the current strategy is the right one, the top general made it clear that he wasn't ruling anything out. Dempsey's more open position comes after President Obama has faced criticism from Republicans and military strategists for completely shutting the door on ever sending American combat troops to Iraq. ""I would never tell the enemy what I was willing to do or unwilling to do,"" House Speaker John Boehner said last week. ""The President has made clear that he doesn't want U.S. boots on the ground. Well, somebody's boots have to be on the ground."" Obama faced similar criticism from Sens. John McCain of Arizona and South Carolina's Lindsey Graham. And while Obama's unequivocal statements about combat troops may give ISIS insight into the U.S. military playbook, the President's statements aim to reassure a war-weary American public. While three-quarters of Americans favor airstrikes against ISIS, 61% of Americans oppose putting U.S. forces in combat situations in Iraq and Syria, according to a September 8 CNN/ORC poll. But after ordering 475 more military advisers to Iraq, Obama has kicked up the total U.S. military presence in the country to about 1,700. And the line separating combat troops from military advisers could become more blurred with time, said Julian Zelizer, a history and public affairs professor at Princeton University. And American casualties could push the U.S. to ramp up the military effort in Iraq. ""Whenever you put someone in danger overseas whether they're fighting or advising, it gives the potential to get bigger,"" Zelizer said. ""Any war can expand into something much greater, you just can't predict how it will unfold."" American casualties could tip the balance, he said, noting that the current escalation came shortly after two American journalists were beheaded by ISIS in a video posted online. ""You can imagine the same thing happening with two people who are serving directly the U.S. government,"" Zelizer said. How many more Western captives is ISIS holding?","Gen.

"Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN) -- Between 2010 and 2012, more than a quarter of a million people died in the famine in Somalia -- in part because the world was too slow to react, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Somalia said Thursday. Half of the 258,000 Somalis who died in the famine were children younger than 5, Philippe Lazzarini said in a statement. The report, jointly commissioned by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and the USAID-funded Famine Early Warning Systems Network, is the first scientific study on deaths in the crisis. It ""confirms that we should have done more before famine was declared on 20 July 2011,"" Lazzarini said. The world did not do enough after warnings in 2010 that starvation loomed following severe drought. And the people who needed help the most were extremely inaccessible, he said. Opinion: Somalia famine a 'crime against humanity'? ""The suffering played out like a drama without witnesses."" A massive mobilization of the humanitarian community followed the official U.N. declaration of famine, said Lazzarini, which ""helped mitigate the worst effects of the crisis."" The study, which covered the period from October 2010 to April 2012, suggests that an estimated 4.6% of the total population and 10% of children younger than 5 died in southern and central Somalia. In the worst-affected area, Lower Shabelle, close to one in five children younger than 5 died. At the peak of the crisis, between May and August 2011, famine and severe food insecurity claimed some 30,000 lives a month, the report said. The United Nations has been working with its humanitarian partners to change the way they operate, Lazzarini said. Some 2.7 million people in Somalia are still in need of life-saving assistance. Opinion: Why Americans should care about famine in Africa . ""Our aim is to ensure that Somalia never goes through another famine again,"" he said. 'Catastrophic shocks' Several factors led to the crisis, according to the report. First, the year from July 2010 to June 2011 was the driest in the eastern Horn of Africa in 60 years. This resulted in the death of livestock, small harvests and a big drop in demand for labor, cutting into household incomes. Southern Somalia also received less humanitarian assistance in 2010 and much of 2011 than it had in previous years, particularly 2008 to 2009, the report said. In many areas, conflict and security concerns -- prompted by the activities of al Qaeda-linked Islamist group al-Shabaab -- hindered humanitarian aid and access. And with reduced supplies available, the price of food staples soared, putting more pressure on poor households. ""For millions of Somalis, already weakened by chronic food insecurity and persistently high levels of acute malnutrition, the shocks were catastrophic,"" said the report. The result was what the researchers say was one of the worst famines in the past 25 years. Their estimate of the number of people who died from the famine -- on top of those who died as a result of conflict or other causes -- was calculated using a range of information, including mortality surveys and data on food prices and wages. ""We now have a picture of the true enormity of this human tragedy,'' said Mark Smulders, a senior economist for the FAO. ""Lessons drawn from this experience will help the international community, together with the people of the region, build a stronger and more resilient future."" 'Political failures' International humanitarian organization Oxfam said Thursday that the mistakes made in Somalia in 2011 must never be repeated. ""Famines are not natural phenomena, they are catastrophic political failures,"" it said in a statement. ""The world was too slow to respond to stark warnings of drought, exacerbated by conflict in Somalia, and people paid with their lives. These deaths could and should have been prevented, and such a shocking death toll must never be allowed to happen again."" World leaders meeting in London next week to discuss the situation in Somalia ""must take steps to ensure that this was Somalia's last famine,"" Oxfam said. This means investing in long-term development, creating jobs, supporting farmers and pastoralists, and ensuring properly trained security forces to help achieve the ""just and sustainable peace"" the country so badly needs, it said. Somalia has lacked an effective central government since 1991, with portions of the Horn of Africa nation left lawless. Its shaky transitional government, backed by African Union peacekeepers, has been battling Islamist guerrillas for years. CNN's Nima Elbagir reported from Mogadishu and Laura Smith-Spark wrote and reported in London. CNN's Alexander Felton and Ben Brumfield contributed to this report.","NEW: ""These deaths could and should have been prevented,"" says Oxfam .

"An arm, legs, underwear, dark jeans and size 5½ Air Jordan sneakers turned up on the Queens side of the East River. The jeans and shoes were the same size of Avonte Oquendo, an autistic 14-year-old last seen last fall walking unsupervised out of his school. Yet his mother was steadfast: ""It's not Avonte until it's Avonte."" That time has come. On Tuesday -- five days after those body parts and scraps of clothing were found -- Vanessa Fontaine learned that DNA tests proved her son's remains indeed had been found. Her lawyer said that Fontaine has been stoic, strong, focused and hopeful throughout this ordeal. But after police told her the news on Tuesday, ""she finally just broke down ... just crying and crying."" ""I kept saying, Vanessa, say it again,"" David Perecman said of his muddled phone conversation. To which she replied through the tears, ""It's Avonte, it's Avonte. (The police) came. It's Avonte."" So ended not just her family's search for the teenager, but that of the United States' most populated city. Police deployed sniffer dogs, combed surveillance footage and repeatedly canvassed each of New York City's 468 subway stations because of  Avonte's love of trains. Missing teen's fascination with trains shifts search . The most poignant, most personal part of the search was Fontaine's recorded voice that was broadcast from patrol cars and other search vehicles. Avonte couldn't communicate verbally and had the mental capacity of a 7- or 8-year-old. But Fontaine hoped that he would hear her and head toward a police car's flashing lights to safety. ""Avonte, this is your mother,"" the recording said. ""You are safe. Walk toward the lights."" Still, while the hunt for Avonte is over, the saga is not. For one, funeral services for the teen still have to be planned. And admitting he personally is ""good and angry,"" Perecman reeled off a number of accusations against the Riverview School (also known as the Center Boulevard School) in the Long Island City section of Queens. They included questions such as: Why did it take ""several minutes"" for Avonte's teacher to notice he wasn't in class? Why did it take 15 minutes for school administrators to find out? Why were police in a neighborhood precinct not alerted for about an hour? Hinting that the family will sue the city, Perecman said videotapes he's seen suggested ""sheer chaos"" in a school that he contends is not safe. ""I am convinced, in my heart of hearts, that had a prompt reaction occurred, had some of this cascade of errors not occurred, that the police would have been called, they would have went outside, and they would have found Avonte before this happened,"" Perecman said. ""He would be home right now. He would be wearing his Air Jordans, and they wouldn't have been found in a river."" Massive hunt for missing teen . A message from CNN left with the school's dean on Tuesday night was not immediately returned. When such allegations were made previously, the school had declined to comment, while the New York City Department of Education had said that it was cooperating with police. What has been established from official accounts is that at 12:38 p.m. on October 4, surveillance video showed Avonte leaving his school for children with learning disabilities. Given Avonte's condition, he should have had a monitor at all times.  But the video indicated he was alone. About three hours later, bloodhounds traced his scent to a marsh near his school but lost the trail, a source close to the investigation said. They picked up his scent again an hour later, this time at a nearby subway station. But while the dogs might have picked up his scent, they couldn't find Avonte. The search, though, didn't end that day. New York police at one point devoted 50 officers and a task force of detectives to the case, according to then-Police Commissioner Ray Kelly. The Metropolitan Transit Authority had its workers check each of its facilities each morning. The Department of Environmental Protection brought in special cameras extended on poles to search the sewer system in and around the area where Avonte went missing, the source said. And Avonte's family pressed their case with the media and the public, even after Kelly said later in October that ""unfortunately, we are not hopeful that we're going to find this young man alive."" ""My message to my son is that I love him, and we're going to find him,"" she told CNN's Piers Morgan.""You'll come home to your family. And for anyone who has him, please be kind and to let him go."" NYC police losing hope; not Avonte's mom . It wasn't just his family who kept working and maintained hope, Perecman said. So, too, did many New Yorkers who participated in the search or, at the least, kept their eyes out for Avonte, helped by the fliers and posters that blanketed the city. Said Perecman: ""I don't remember a search in the city of New York that rose to this level. It was a beautiful sight."" Body parts, clothes found in East River . Whatever the outcome, Avonte's family laid the groundwork to sue New York's government days after he went missing. They filed a claim -- the first step in a lawsuit -- over what they described as ""the negligence, carelessness and/or recklessness"" of those who'd been charged with watching Avonte that day. Then came last week's discovery of clothes that matched those worn by the slim, approximately 5-foot, 3-inch teenager, as well as the remains. Lawyer: Police checking on remains . The fact they were found in the East River also jibed with a possible storyline, given the Riverview School's location near the water around where the Queens Midtown Tunnel goes to and from Manhattan. The matching clothes were not enough for Fontaine and company. ""They weren't  going to accept anything else but DNA,"" her lawyer said. And DNA, ultimately, proved that the remains indeed belonged to Avonte. So how and when did Avonte die? The medical examiner hasn't issued a public ruling, though the gory state of the teenager's remains leaves open an alarming array of possibilities. Perecman said he doesn't know if foul play is to blame, whether the fact the boy was found in pieces stems from natural decomposition in the water or something more gruesome. ""You know what they say, you put 10 people in a room you get 12 opinions,"" the lawyer said of the diverse range of theories as to what happened.","Avonte Oquendo's mother was hopeful until the very end, her lawyer says .
He says Avonte would be alive if not for ""cascade of errors"" at school he'd attended .

"A beloved model is dead, those who knew her are in mourning, and one of the world's most admired Olympians is charged with her murder after a Valentine's Day shooting in South Africa. Oscar Pistorius, a Paralympic runner who blazed new terrain by competing in last summer's Olympics, is accused of killing his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp.  A shooting took place inside his upscale home in Pretoria, South Africa, early Thursday, and only the two of them were there at the time, police said. Shock waves from the incident quickly reverberated across the world, casting a shadow over the man known as the ""Blade Runner"" for his achievements on prosthetic limbs. Pistorius will be named officially as the suspect when he appears in court Friday, in keeping with South African law.  Authorities have already announced that the suspect is Pistorius' age. Investigators gave no motive for the alleged killing. Read more: 'Blade runner' Pistorius: Track hero at center of shooting probe . ""Previous incidents"" at the home, police say . Police were alerted to the shooting by neighbors, and residents had ""heard things earlier,"" spokeswoman Denise Beukes said. A police spokeswoman said there had been ""previous incidents"" at the home, including ""allegations of a domestic nature.""  They did not detail what those may be. Pistorius was arrested and accused of common assault in 2009, but the case was thrown out because of a lack of evidence, police told CNN on Thursday. That incident involved Pistorius allegedly slamming a door during a party, and a piece of the door fell off and hit someone, said Capt. Marissa Van der Merwe of South African police. Police are not aware of any prior incidents between Pistorius and Steenkamp, Van der Merwe said. Some South African media outlets suggested Pistorius may have mistaken Steenkamp for an intruder. South Africa has a high crime rate, and many homeowners keep weapons to ward off intruders. Beukes said those reports did not come from police. There did not appear to be signs of forced entry at the home, she added. ""This is a very quiet area, and this is a secure estate,"" Beukes said. A pistol was recovered at the scene, police said. In November 2011, Pistorius tweeted a photo of himself at a gun range, and wrote that he had ""a 96% headshot over 300m from 50 shots! Bam!"" Pistorius cooperating with police . Pistorius has made no public statement. His spokeswoman Kate Silvers said the athlete is ""assisting the police with their investigation but there will be no further comment until matters become clearer later today."" Police also said Pistorius is cooperating. He arrived Thursday at a police station in Pretoria. Beukes said the state will oppose bail. That means the 26-year-old, who was among the men featured in People magazine's ""Sexiest Man Alive"" issue, could be behind bars, at least temporarily. Pistorius is not being brought to court Thursday because the public prosecutor needs more time to prepare the case, police spokeswoman Katlego Mogale told CNN. A model's life violently cut short . Steenkamp, 29, had been looking forward to Valentine's Day, encouraging her Twitter followers to ""get excited"" for the holiday. On Wednesday, she tweeted, ""It's a beautiful day! Make things happen. Starting my day off with a yummy healthy shake from my boo,"" followed by a smiley face.  ""Boo"" is a term for boyfriend. ""She was the kindest, sweetest human being; an angel on earth and will be sorely missed,"" Capacity Relations, the agency that represented her, wrote on Twitter. She was ""just a great, fun presence of a person,"" said Hagen Engler, former editor of the magazine FHM. He described her as ""a bikini model, beautiful, gorgeous girl"" with a ""wicked"" sense of humor.  She understood the industry and was intelligent and fun to work with, he said. Pistorius' father, Henke, told the South African Broadcasting Corp. his son was ""sad at the moment."" ""I don't know nothing. It will be extremely obnoxious and rude to speculate,"" the father said. ""I don't know the facts."" Nike pulls ad . Nike pulled an ad featuring Pistorius from its website Thursday.  The ad showed Pistorius taking off for a run, and contained the words"" I am the bullet in the chamber."" The company issued a statement expressing ""sympathy and condolences to the families concerned following this tragic incident.""  The company added that it will not comment further, noting that the situation is a police matter. Other Pistorius sponsors -- including prosthetics manufacturer Ossur, British Telecom, and Oakley, which makes sunglasses and other products -- expressed condolences and said they had no further comment at this time.  Fashion company Thierry Mugler had no comment. As Olympian, Pistorius faced controversy . Pistorius, a double amputee, competed against able-bodied runners during the London Olympics, triggering controversy as some said the prosthetic limbs gave him an advantage. His legs were amputated below the knee when he was a toddler because of a bone defect. He runs on special carbon fiber blades. Pistorius was initially refused permission to enter the Olympics, but he hired a legal team to prove that his artificial limbs did not give him an unfair advantage -- and was allowed to compete. While he did not win a medal, his presence on the track was lauded by many people around the world as an example of victory over adversity and dedication to a goal. He smashed a Paralympic record to win the men's 400m T44 in the final athletics event of the 2012 Games. In an October interview with CNN's ""Piers Morgan Tonight,"" Pistorius discussed the ""massive blessing"" of inspiring people around the world. ""Being an international sportsman, there's a lot of responsibility that comes with that, so having to toggle that and remembering, you know, that there are kids out there, especially, that look up to you -- it's definitely something that you need to keep at the back of your mind.""

"What do you call a politician who has close friends running three coordinating super PACs with a stated goal of laying the groundwork for that politician's presidential campaign? You might call her Hillary Clinton, candidate for president of the United States. The lazy, cliche take on how the media are covering Hillary Clinton is that there's too much of an early focus on someone who hasn't declared her intentions. While it's true that the breathless ""Will she or won't she?"" chatter is overkill, the flaw is in the substance. The reality is Hillary Clinton is running a campaign for president right now, whether she'll admit it or not, so she should be held to account by the media and voters the way any other candidate would. This week that campaign has taken her to the West Coast, where she has been giving a series of stump speeches just the way a presidential candidate would -- only she's getting paid $200K a pop. You can see the evidence of her taking advantage of this dichotomy -- letting her allies build a campaign while she avoids the scrutiny -- in her words, actions, and history. There are clear incentives for Clinton to have her cake and eat it too. An analysis of her favorability ratings over time shows that she's always polled the lowest when she's a candidate and highest when she can ""stay above the fray."" Her allies speculate that her favorability ratings may face a double-digit drop once she becomes an official candidate. Her State Department tenure was marked with the caution of someone eyeing a future campaign. According to the new book ""HRC,"" she hired political staff to ""keep the Clinton political network humming at State."" Her accomplishments were nil, largely because the only major policy risks she took -- a reset in Russia and support for the overthrow of former dictator Moammar Gadhafi in Libya -- have become vulnerabilities. After over 20 years in Washington handing out favors to friends and moving with the political winds, it benefits Clinton to let some of the more controversial issues play out rather than take a stand now. Among the vital issues she's currently taking a pass on are NSA spying (Clinton planned a speech, canceled it, and hasn't spoken in any detail on the subject since); the Keystone Pipeline, an issue that her department had jurisdiction over in the Obama administration; and the implementation of Obamacare. While she avoids these critical issues, she is amassing an army of super PACs unprecedented in their scope. They work together -- with a clear division of labor -- to do her political bidding while giving her the cover to be a ""private citizen."" -- Ready for Hillary is the grass-roots outfit run by longtime Clinton confidant Craig Smith, who has been called an ""adopted son"" of the Clintons. Smith told Time that the goal of the organization is ""to build the Ferrari of grass-roots operations"" for Hillary Clinton to drive when the time is right. -- American Bridge PAC's Correct the Record is charged with defending Clinton's record in the media. Its founder, David Brock, is a top Clinton ally. The group's day-to-day operations are run by another Arkansan, Adrienne Elrod, who was with Clinton in 2008 and was tasked with staying on after the campaign to create a ""hit list"" of political foes, according to ""HRC."" -- Priorities USA Action, once President Obama's super PAC, is run by a who's who of Democrat elites with ties to the Clintons and has committed to handling the big-dollar advertising campaign. Its board includes executives from both American Bridge and Ready for Hillary. A spokesman for Ready for Hillary called the groups ""a family."" So given that she has close friends building a coordinated family of grass-roots, messaging, fund-raising and advertising infrastructure for a campaign, what exactly are we speculating about again? If Hillary Clinton wants to be treated as a private citizen/celebrity/world traveler who doesn't have to answer to voters and the media, she should disavow these PACs and ask her friends to stand down while she makes a decision.  Short of that, she is a presidential candidate and should be treated as such. She's a presidential candidate when she is being paid $200,000 to speak by companies that would lobby her administration should she be elected. She's a presidential candidate when she's traveling the country raising money for the Clinton Foundation from the same donor base that would fund her campaign. And she's a presidential candidate when she's choosing to avoid taking a stand on issues that might jeopardize her electoral chances.

"(CNN) -- Not so long ago, Germany was vilified for its slow economic growth, high unemployment rates, and record budget deficits. As late as 2004, The Economist called it the ""sick man of Europe."" Today, Germany is the world's fourth largest economy, and the most important market in the European Union. Its 5.3% unemployment rate is the second lowest in the EU. Germany exports more merchandise than any other country aside from China, and its share of total world trade is larger than that of the U.S. Not bad for a nation of 81 million citizens that's not even among the world's 15 most populated worldwide. The roots of Germany's 21st century economic success date back to the Industrial Revolution, when Germans were early adopters of rail transportation and coal production. But the country's current rise to status of economic superstar began on a cold autumn day, exactly 25 years ago. Fall of the wall . On November 9, 1989, a group of excited Berliners used mauls, chisels, hammers and fists to smash down the wall that divided the West and East part of the city. The fall of the Berlin Wall was a landmark moment, which intensified a process that fully materialized two years later with the collapse of the Soviet Union. What West Germans found when they entered East Germany was a society marked by high unemployment rate, low productivity and a lot of poverty. They also found a highly skilled workforce that was comparatively cheap, and new markets with an appetite for products. They found opportunities -- not only in the eastern part of their reunified nation, but also in many other former Soviet-bloc countries, like the Czech Republic, Romania and Slovakia. ""Part of the success story of the German multinationals was their capacity to use the opportunities that arose -- first with reunification, and secondly with the expansion of the EU,"" said Fredrik Erixon, director of the European Centre for International Political Economy, a Brussels-based think tank. ""German companies became increasingly skilled at understanding foreign markets and leaning towards foreign markets. Germany has done that in a way which I'd say is more efficient than what you see in the United Kingdom or France, which are the other two big economies that traditionally have had an outward-oriented vision."" Ahead of the times . By the end of the 1990s, businesses from Germany played key roles in countries transitioning to a market economy, according to Erixon. German manufacturers were outsourcing parts of their supply chain to Eastern Europe, and German financial firms provided services to millions of people who were just discovering capitalism. It didn't end on the eastern edge of Europe. Germany turned into one of the world's largest exporters by going even further east to the emerging Asian markets, especially China and India, according to Irwin Collier, professor of economics at Free University Berlin. ""You have these two huge blocks, huge economies that were starving for investment goods and it just so happens that is where Germany had its comparative advantage -- in the production of investment goods,"" Collier said. ""The high Chinese growth rates meant there was enormous demand for German goods."" The goods Collier referred to are mainly vehicles, machinery, pharmaceuticals and electronics. German car manufacturers like BMW, Mercedes and Volkswagen established a particularly strong presence in the Chinese market. Companies like Siemens, BASF (chemicals), Deutsche Bank (one Europe's largest banks), and Allianz (insurance) also became leading global corporations. Promoting skills . In addition, thousands of medium-sized companies, often family owned, have been successful internationally and particularly in Asia, according to Anke Hassel, professor of public policy at the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin. Hassel said one of the keys to Germany's manufacturing success is the country's unique apprenticeship scheme, in which school leavers spend two to three years training with companies. ""The apprenticeship scheme is very important in particular for manufacturing companies because they train people at mid-level skills in a very specific way,"" said Hassel. ""They give them industry and firm-specific skills."" Hassel explained that having relatively highly-skilled workers allows companies to be more flexible with their production process, and continuously improve. But it's not all rosy. According to Hassel, Germany's dependence on exports make it very vulnerable. During the 2008-09 financial crisis, the loss of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Germany experienced was large compare to other countries, and even today fluctuations in the world economy are immediately felt in the German economy. And fluctuations will always happen. Currently, as market demand in China and other emerging markets is slowing down, Germany's challenge is to rebalance its economy away from an enormously heavy dependence on exports. It needs to increase domestic consumption, which has been relatively weak for decades, otherwise the economic growth it has experienced will not be sustained. In the quarter of a century that has passed since the Berliners tore down that wall, Germany has, no doubt, become an economic superpower. But as Germans know better than anyone, economic realities can change very quickly.","Today, Germany is the world's fourth largest economy with a low unemployment rate .
The 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall highlights economic success .
Collapse of East and West has meant massive growth for Germany in various industries ."
"It's official: U.S. President Barack Obama wants lawmakers to weigh in on whether to use military force in Syria. Obama sent a letter to the heads of the House and Senate on Saturday night, hours after announcing that he believes military action against Syrian targets is the right step to take over the alleged use of chemical weapons. The proposed legislation from Obama asks Congress to approve the use of military force ""to deter, disrupt, prevent and degrade the potential for future uses of chemical weapons or other weapons of mass destruction."" It's a step that is set to turn an international crisis into a fierce domestic political battle. There are key questions looming over the debate: What did U.N. weapons inspectors find in Syria? What happens if Congress votes no? And how will the Syrian government react? In a televised address from the White House Rose Garden earlier Saturday, the president said he would take his case to Congress, not because he has to -- but because he wants to. ""While I believe I have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization, I know that the country will be stronger if we take this course, and our actions will be even more effective,"" he said. ""We should have this debate, because the issues are too big for business as usual."" Obama said top congressional leaders had agreed to schedule a debate when the body returns to Washington on September 9. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will hold a hearing over the matter on Tuesday, Sen. Robert Menendez said. Transcript: Read Obama's full remarks . Syrian crisis: Latest developments . U.N. inspectors leave Syria . Obama's remarks came shortly after U.N. inspectors left Syria, carrying evidence that will determine whether chemical weapons were used in an attack early last week in a Damascus suburb. ""The aim of the game here, the mandate, is very clear -- and that is to ascertain whether chemical weapons were used -- and not by whom,"" U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky told reporters on Saturday. But who used the weapons in the reported toxic gas attack in a Damascus suburb on August 21 has been a key point of global debate over the Syrian crisis. Top U.S. officials have said there's no doubt that the Syrian government was behind it, while Syrian officials have denied responsibility and blamed jihadists fighting with the rebels. British and U.S. intelligence reports say the attack involved chemical weapons, but U.N. officials have stressed the importance of waiting for an official report from inspectors. The inspectors will share their findings with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon Ban, who has said he wants to wait until the U.N. team's final report is completed before presenting it to the U.N. Security Council. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which nine of the inspectors belong to, said Saturday that it could take up to three weeks to analyze the evidence they collected. ""It needs time to be able to analyze the information and the samples,"" Nesirky said. He noted that Ban has repeatedly said there is no alternative to a political solution to the crisis in Syria, and that ""a military solution is not an option."" Bergen:  Syria is a problem from hell for the U.S. Obama: 'This menace must be confronted' Obama's senior advisers have debated the next steps to take, and the president's comments Saturday came amid mounting political pressure over the situation in Syria. Some U.S. lawmakers have called for immediate action while others warn of stepping into what could become a quagmire. Some global leaders have expressed support, but the British Parliament's vote against military action earlier this week was a blow to Obama's hopes of getting strong backing from key NATO allies. On Saturday, Obama proposed what he said would be a limited military action against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Any military attack would not be open-ended or include U.S. ground forces, he said. Syria's alleged use of chemical weapons earlier this month ""is an assault on human dignity,"" the president said. A failure to respond with force, Obama argued,  ""could lead to escalating use of chemical weapons or their proliferation to terrorist groups who would do our people harm. In a world with many dangers, this menace must be confronted."" Syria missile strike: What would happen next? Map: U.S. and allied assets around Syria . Obama decision came Friday night . On Friday night, the president made a last-minute decision to consult lawmakers. What will happen if they vote no? It's unclear. A senior administration official told CNN that Obama has the authority to act without Congress -- even if Congress rejects his request for authorization to use force. Obama on Saturday continued to shore up support for a strike on the al-Assad government. He spoke by phone with French President Francois Hollande before his Rose Garden speech. ""The two leaders agreed that the international community must deliver a resolute message to the Assad regime -- and others who would consider using chemical weapons -- that these crimes are unacceptable and those who violate this international norm will be held accountable by the world,"" the White House said. Meanwhile, as uncertainty loomed over how Congress would weigh in, U.S. military officials said they remained at the ready. 5 key assertions: U.S. intelligence report on Syria . Syria: Who wants what after chemical weapons horror . Reactions mixed to Obama's speech . A spokesman for the Syrian National Coalition said that the opposition group was disappointed by Obama's announcement. ""Our fear now is that the lack of action could embolden the regime and they repeat his attacks in a more serious way,"" said spokesman Louay Safi. ""So we are quite concerned."" Some members of Congress applauded Obama's decision. House Speaker John Boehner, Majority Leader Eric Cantor, Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy and Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers issued a statement Saturday praising the president. ""Under the Constitution, the responsibility to declare war lies with Congress,"" the Republican lawmakers said. ""We are glad the president is seeking authorization for any military action in Syria in response to serious, substantive questions being raised."" More than 160 legislators, including 63 of Obama's fellow Democrats, had signed letters calling for either a vote or at least a ""full debate"" before any U.S. action. British Prime Minister David Cameron, whose own attempt to get lawmakers in his country to support military action in Syria failed earlier this week, responded to Obama's speech in a Twitter post Saturday. ""I understand and support Barack Obama's position on Syria,"" Cameron said. An influential lawmaker in Russia -- which has stood by Syria and criticized the United States -- had his own theory. ""The main reason Obama is turning to the Congress:  the military operation did not get enough support either in the world, among allies of the US or in the United States itself,"" Alexei Pushkov, chairman of the international-affairs committee of the Russian State Duma, said in a Twitter post. In the United States, scattered groups of anti-war protesters around the country took to the streets Saturday. ""Like many other Americans...we're just tired of the United States getting involved and invading and bombing other countries,"" said Robin Rosecrans, who was among hundreds at a Los Angeles demonstration. What do Syria's neighbors think? Why Russia, China, Iran stand by Assad . Syria's government unfazed . After Obama's speech, a military and political analyst on Syrian state TV said Obama is ""embarrassed"" that Russia opposes military action against Syria, is ""crying for help"" for someone to come to his rescue and is facing two defeats -- on the political and military levels. Syria's prime minister appeared unfazed by the saber-rattling. ""The Syrian Army's status is on maximum readiness and fingers are on the trigger to confront all challenges,"" Wael Nader al-Halqi said during a meeting with a delegation of Syrian expatriates from Italy, according to a banner on Syria State TV that was broadcast prior to Obama's address. An anchor on Syrian state television said Obama ""appeared to be preparing for an aggression on Syria based on repeated lies."" A top Syrian diplomat told the state television network that Obama was facing pressure to take military action from Israel, Turkey, some Arabs and right-wing extremists in the United States. ""I think he has done well by doing what Cameron did in terms of taking the issue to Parliament,"" said Bashar Jaafari, Syria's ambassador to the United Nations. Both Obama and Cameron, he said, ""climbed to the top of the tree and don't know how to get down."" The Syrian government has denied that it used chemical weapons in the August 21 attack, saying that jihadists fighting with the rebels used them in an effort to turn global sentiments against it. British intelligence had put the number of people killed in the attack at more than 350. On Saturday, Obama said ""all told, well over 1,000 people were murdered."" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Friday cited a death toll of 1,429, more than 400 of them children. No explanation was offered for the discrepancy.

"A day after talks in Geneva between Iran and six world powers over Tehran's nuclear ambitions ended on a promising note, Iran's state-run news agency quoted government officials as expressing optimism that differences can be resolved. Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said the so-called P5+1 -- the United States, Russia, China, France and Britain, all countries with permanent seats on the U.N. Security Council, plus Germany -- ""has accepted the overall framework of Tehran's new proposal to settle differences but said we should wait for their practical measures,"" IRNA reported Thursday. ""Araqchi further referred to uranium enrichment as Iran's red line in the negotiations, adding that Iran could still negotiate over the level and the volume of enrichment,"" it added. According to Araqchi, who is taking a lead role in the negotiations, the sides could reach an agreement in as little as three to six months. And Mansour Haghighat-Pour, the vice chairman of the government's National Security and Foreign Policy Committee, said it appeared that the two days of talks in Geneva ""were more serious and technical"" than previous negotiations had been. Their remarks came a day after the participants in Geneva said in a joint statement that the talks had been ""substantive and forward-looking."" The tone appeared to signal a shift from the diplomatic tension that prevailed under former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The discussions centered on a proposal put forth by Iran, which wants the six powers to recognize what it says is the peaceful nature of its nuclear energy pursuits. Details, however, were scarce. ""We will be doing the negotiation in the negotiating room and not in the press,"" Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif told reporters after the talks. Discussions were to resume November 7 and 8. ""The Iranian proposal was a new proposal with a level of seriousness and substance that we had not seen before,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters. But, he added, ""These are complicated issues. They're technical issues. And as the President has said, the history of mistrust is very deep. ""The onus remains on Iran to come into compliance with its international obligations.  And any deal must prove to the international community that Iran's program will be used for exclusively peaceful purposes."" European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton, who is leading the talks for the P5+1 bloc, called it a ""very intensive and very important meeting."" She too declined to offer specifics but said they were the most detailed to date. The joint statement built on hope that was expressed after the first day of the talks. ""For the first time, we had very detailed technical discussions,"" a senior U.S. State Department official said. A spokesman for the EU's foreign policy chief called Iran's presentation ""very useful."" Zarif, who is leading the Iranian delegation, said Wednesday in a Facebook posting that Iran's proposal outlined ""a new view, which emphasizes the need for pursuing a common goal by all players"" and identified areas that must be agreed upon. ""This framework was welcomed as a new approach by the heads of the delegations,"" he said. ""Of course we would like to see a new approach by the 5+1, as well."" Opinion: Why there's room to strike a deal . 'Ball is in Iran's court' Some observers fear Iran is pursuing a nuclear bomb, but Iran -- slapped with sanctions because of its program -- has maintained that it is developing nuclear energy capabilities for peaceful purposes only. Iran insists the West must accept its right to enrich nuclear fuel for civilian purposes as allowed under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, to which Iran is a signatory. Thawing relations? The Geneva talks are the first at such a high level since the election of President Hassan Rouhani this summer raised the prospect of a shift in direction from Iran. During a visit to the U.N. General Assembly in September, Rouhani's diplomatic approach raised hopes in the West of a thaw in relations with Tehran and progress in negotiations on its nuclear program. Rouhani's visit culminated in a phone call with U.S. President Barack Obama and a meeting between U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Iran's Zarif. Iran nuclear talks are key topic as Obama, Netanyahu meet . It was the first such contact between top officials of the two countries since Iran's 1979 revolution, which sent relations into a deep freeze. In another sign of easing tensions, Iran's state news agency IRNA reported Wednesday that Iran and Britain plan to introduce their nonresident charges d'affaires --  the level of diplomat below ambassador -- within two weeks. Tehran and London agreed to the step on October 8, after a telephone call between Zarif and his British counterpart, William Hague. The diplomats' mission will be to improve relations on the way to the eventual reopening of embassies, Hague said then. Asked about Wednesday's IRNA report, Britain's Foreign and Commonwealth Office told CNN that an announcement would be made in due course. Britain closed its embassy in Iran and evacuated its diplomatic staff in late 2011 after hundreds of student protesters stormed the embassy and another British diplomatic compound. In turn, Hague ordered closed the Iranian Embassy in London, saying that Iran was in breach of its international obligations to protect diplomatic missions. Israel warns against easing sanctions . Israel has warned against easing the economic sanctions imposed against Iran. Such a move would be a ""historic mistake,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday. ""Now is an opportune moment to reach a genuine diplomatic solution that peacefully ends Iran's military nuclear program,"" he said. ""This opportunity can only be realized if the international community continues to place pressure on Iran, because it is that pressure that has brought Iran back to the negotiations in the first place."" Alireza Jafarzadeh, with the opposition National Council of Resistance of Iran, accused Iran of using them to buy time to move forward with its nuclear weapons program. He called for still tighter sanctions. ""The P5+1 is allowing Iran to talk its way into a nuclear bomb; this explains the new atmospherics and smiles by the Iranian regime's officials,"" Jafarzadeh said. ""The ruling mullahs only understand the language of strength and decisiveness. More concessions will only result in more deceit by the Iranian regime."" Ali Larijani, Iran's powerful parliamentary speaker and a close associate of the nation's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said last week that Iran is serious about resolving the dispute over its nuclear program. It is keen to resolve the issue ""in a short period of time,"" he told CNN's Christiane Amanpour in an exclusive interview from Geneva. ""From Iran's side, I can say that we are ready,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Iran and Turkey signed a trade pact Sunday, one which Tehran said could be worth $30 billion over five years and signaled even stronger ties between the two nations. Both nation's leaders touted the agreement as something that could provide huge mutual economic benefit, according to their respective state media. Tehran, especially, played up the deal as evidence of a new era in relations. ""Iran and Turkey are two countries that complete each other,"" Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi said, according to Turkey's official Anadolu news. The agreement capped the nations' 22nd annual joint economic meeting, evidence that Tehran and Ankara have a long working relationship. Still, it comes amid Iran's nuclear tensions with the United States -- a staunch ally of Turkey. In an account from Iran's official IRNA news agency, Salehi said the agreement and other recent moves indicate that Turkey is committed to bolstering its ties with Middle Eastern nations. ""Ankara is strengthening its relations with its neighboring countries, particularly the Islamic republic of Iran,"" Salehi said. The Iranian foreign minister further proposed an even greater union to advance both nations' interests, according to Press TV, Iranian state media. Turkish State Minister Cevdet Yilmaz noted that trade between his nation and Iran has risen from $1 billion to $10.7 billion in the past decade. Still, he said that it could go even further, with Sunday's pact to ratchet down protectionist measures and promote cooperation potentially instrumental to that cause. Also Sunday, Turkish Premier Recep Tayyip Erdogan met with the head of Syria, another U.S. nemesis, according to reports from state media in both nations. In an official statement published on Syria's state-run Sana news agency, President Bashar al-Assad said that he and his Turkish counterpart ""stressed the importance of continuing work and coordination by the two countries through high-level transparent dialogue."" In a speech marking the laying of the cornerstone of the Friendship Dam, along the nation's border with Syria, Erdogan said that Turkey wanted peace, stability and prosperity, according to an Anadolu report.","Tehran and Ankara ink a pact Sunday to spur trade between the two .

"(CNN) -- Brigham Young University officials on Thursday stood by the decision to dismiss a standout player on the Cougars' highly ranked men's basketball team, saying they are treating Brandon Davies just like they would any other student. The school's athletic department announced Tuesday that Davies -- a starting forward from Provo would no longer be part of the team this season. The university came into the week ranked third in the nation in the Associated Press Top 25 and Coaches polls. Officials did not specify why, exactly, Davies was being suspended during a press conference Thursday. But the Salt Lake Tribune, citing ""multiple sources,"" said that the sophomore violated the honor code provision prohibiting premarital sex among students. Many schools have honor codes, with students mandated to live and learn by certain standards. Still, the one that applies for students at Brigham Young's campuses in Utah, Hawaii and Idaho is more extensive than most, part of a conscious effort to ""provide an education in an atmosphere consistent with the ideals and principles of the The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints."" The BYU code include requirements for ""modest, neat and clean"" dress and grooming; abstinence from alcohol, tobacco or illegal substances; any physical intimacy that exhibits homosexual feelings; prohibiting members of the opposite sex from going in one's bedroom areas; and regularly participation in church services, be they in the Mormon or another religious faith. Tom Holmoe, the school's athletic director, said Thursday that its honor code is something that the university does not shy away from. And it applies equally to all students, athletes or not, with Davies simply being held to the same high standards as anyone else. ""We understand that people across the country might think this is foreign to them, and they are shocked and surprised,"" said Holmoe. ""But for us, we deal with this quite often."" While officials would not specify when the process began, Holmoe said that Davies ""was involved from the very beginning."" He was dropped from the team just weeks ahead of the NCAA basketball tournament, in which BYU -- led by star Jimmer Fredette -- is a contender to be one of four top seeds. The Cougars lost their first game without Davies to New Mexico on Wednesday, only their third defeat this season. ""We all love Brandon,"" Dave Rose, the team's coach, told reporters Thursday. ""He's a great teammate, and he's been great for our team."" Rose admitted that the team was ""disappointed"" by Davies' ouster. But especially with a few days' hindsight, the coach said they were ready to tackle the ""huge challenge"" that lay ahead of them. The decision to remove Davies was made by the university athletics department, pending the results of the full honor code investigation. School spokeswoman Carri Jenkins said there's no timetable for that probe, which could potentially lead to Davies' permanent dismissal from the team or from the school. But Holmoe said that he hopes Davies, who remains a student at BYU, returns to the court next season. ""I know Brandon Davies, and what I'm looking forward to ... is to see him come back strong,"" the athletic director told reporters. ""This young man has dreams and goals."" Holmoe said officials and coaches at BYU don't view the honor code as a negative, admitting there is some ""self-selection"" as to which students embrace it and come to the university. ""We get kids who want to come here, who say this is what they want,"" he said. ""We recruit to our strengths, and that is a strength.""","Brandon Davies is kicked off the Cougars' basketball team for 'honor code' violation .

"(CNN) -- Who is Santa -- like, really? That's the question at the heart of a new documentary, ""I Am Santa Claus,"" which follows the lives of five Santa impersonators beyond the Christmas season. In the literal sense, the answer the film provides is this: Santa is everyone who can supply the requisite beard and some Christmas cheer. The Saint Nick stand-ins the filmmakers follow are poor and rich and drunk and fat and kind and gross and sad and sweet. One smells like cookies (it's cologne). One lives in a trailer park in central Michigan. One is a former pro wrestler who used to wear a leather mask and go by the name Mankind as he fake-pummeled Spandex-wearing men on national television. Oh yeah, and one of them is gay. Yep. A gay Santa. Time for a sale on pitchforks at Hobby Lobby, right? Maybe not. The anti-gay backlash to a gay Santa from Texas that you might have expected five years ago (""on his lap?"") hasn't materialized, or hasn't much beyond what director Tommy Avallone calls the ""Santa police,"" or Santa impersonators who want to maintain arbitrarily strict standards about what Santa can or can't be, on or off the sleigh. Maybe that's because the documentary is buzzing below the national radar for now. Maybe it's because it's getting harder to be openly homophobic in public. Or maybe, hopefully, it's because this is Christmas season 2014. Black Friday sales are reportedly down 11%. Airstrikes are flying over Syria. But gay Santas are totally inoffensive. And hallelujah for that. No one (that I've seen) is busy conflating gay men with pedophiles. Few are questioning whether gay men should have a place in a highly commercialized, quasi-religious tradition. No one is rushing to fire Santa because of his sexual orientation. All of those arguments seem so trite these days -- to the point of irrelevance. Sure, there are some utterly homophobic comments to be found online about ""I Am Santa Claus,"" which, full disclosure, was executive produced by Morgan Spurlock, who has a show on CNN. Just turn to the comments section of YouTube, the cesspool of digital humanity, and you'll find people with the true spirit of Christmas beaming through their fingers as they type sentences like, ""So, Santa F** makes his film debut? How disgraceful! We, as a society, have become TOO accepting of immoral lifestyles."" And Mick Foley, the former pro wrestler who's one of the Santas in the documentary, told me he had to take a break from Santa message boards (yes, those exist) and Facebook because of what he perceived to be a homophobic backslash to the film. ""Anyone who expressed shock or outrage -- and there were a lot of people expressing shock and outrage and deep concern -- were probably concerned about the revelation of a gay Santa and what that could mean to their community,"" he said. But the documentary has a 3Â½-star rating (out of a possible 5) on Netflix. One reviewer, Iann Robinson from CraveOnline, writes that he ""sat down to watch the movie as Scrooge, and eventually melted into Ebenezer."" And search social media and you'll find stuff like this tweet: ""Gay Santa from 'I am Santa Claus' is my new favourite person."" I'm heartened by that, and I have to agree. Gay Santa's name is Jim Stevenson. He's in his 70s. From Texas. Beard: nipple-length. He loves being Santa because he doesn't have kids and it gives him a chance to contribute. ""I personally never have had a problem with a straight person about being gay and being Santa,"" he says in the film. ""I've never been admonished for that. I've never been questioned. I've never -- it's just never come up."" The documentary shows Stevenson kissing his boyfriend on a merry-go-round, dealing antiques in a Texas store and posing for photos in his underwear (he does that, apparently). Another Santa who makes a brief appearance in the film is a swinger who goes to sex clubs. Yes, the idea of Santa having sex -- at all, with anyone -- is strange. But does it disqualify him from spreading Christmas cheer? It shouldn't. (Reminder to all kids in the audience, these are stand-in, actor Santas. Not the real deal). In one scene, two of the non-gay Santas consider the bounds of who should be an acceptable Santa impersonator. Those bounds, in my view, should include pretty much everyone who isn't a criminal -- anyone who isn't dangerous to children. Foley, the former pro wrestler, said essentially the same. ""I believe we've had women posed as male Santas,"" he said. ""I graduated Santa Claus school with a very good Jewish Santa. He points out ... who better to work on Christmas Day?"" In Germany, a beloved Santa was fired this week, according to NBC News, possibly because he is older than 70. There's already an online petition calling for his reinstatement. I have a feeling the same would happen if a gay Santa were fired here in the United States -- even if most state laws wouldn't protect his right to not be fired because he's gay. The most important Santa requirement, as outlined in the bylaws of the Fraternal Order of Real Bearded Santas (again, real), is that stand-in Santas ""endeavor to foster a reverence for the Spirit of Christmas & respect for all children, without regard to race, creed or religious denomination.""

"I first came across Ziauddin Yousafzai when I interviewed him in 2007. He was running his own school and had set up a peace council in Pakistan's restive Swat Valley region. An eloquent English speaker, he was very keen to tell me his story on air. Our first conversation was in whispers; the Taliban had started to make inroads in the Swat Valley and were marching around the streets he told me. He was whispering as if he thought the Taliban might hear at that moment. Accolades, applause and a grim milestone . Our cameras could not go into Swat so we conducted our interview on the phone. We did not use his full name or photo to protect his identity -- although Ziauddin insisted we do so. I asked him what an average day was like and he told me, ""Young lady, young boys are being slaughtered here before our very eyes like goats."" I was shocked by the savage image this simple statement had generated in my mind, yet this man had no fear of speaking to us. Visionary . I realized very quickly that this man was something different -- a visionary. Ziauddin and I shared several telephone conversations between 2007 and 2009 during the Taliban's reign of terror in the Swat Valley and the subsequent military operation against them. Children -- particularly girls -- were being stopped from going to school by the hardline Taliban but he had kept his own school open. I asked Ziauddin about his own children and whether he took them to school too. ""Yes of course, my boys are not too bothered but it's my daughter that is giving me the most trouble,"" he said. ""She is insistent she continues going to school."" Pakistan's Malala: Global symbol, but still just a kid . ""Did you try and stop her?"" I asked. ""No,"" he replied. ""It is her right to get an education, but in any case, I'm not sure even if I tried if I could stop her!"" He giggled, in a very proud way. Even in this darkest of hours he could find happiness in his pride. Risking his life to talk to the media. Serene . Years later, when Malala was shot and lay in intensive care guarded by soldiers at a military hospital, I called Ziauddin to ask how she and the family were doing. He recalled our conversations and thanked me for calling. He had a remarkable air of serenity and simply said: ""All we need is your prayers. Pray for my daughter and for us."" Malala speaks with similar courage, compassion and presence. Her message of peace and her calm philosophical approach to life reminds me of her father. Malala: ""I want to become a prime minister of Pakistan"" It is clearly the courage of his conviction that led Ziauddin to talk to me about his hopes for peace and the battle with Islamist militants for the right to be educated many years ago. He spoke passionately and philosophically about his vision. Here was a man born, raised and working in a remote town in Pakistan, immersed in a culture where women wore burkas and rarely left their homes, never without a chaperone. Yet he had the foresight, drive and principles to campaign for education for all and certainly had a huge hand in raising Malala to be the visionary she is today. We have not heard from and do not know much about Malala's mother. A traditional Pahstun woman, who wears traditional clothes and is a housewife. But it seems she wants and supports a very different lifestyle and future for her own daughter. Oppression . In a male-dominated society where the cultural oppression of women is rife, husbands, fathers, brothers -- men like Ziauddin -- are real saviors. They help their wives, sisters, daughters become all they can be; they encourage support and stand by them against all odds. The majority of women here in Pakistan that I meet know their rights, or know they are capable of much more and have huge ambitions. It's the men in Pakistan who need to respect them and support them. The men who are with them and the men in authority. Why Malala's bravery inspires us . Yes, Pakistan needs more girls like Malala. I have met many who are, who defy the Taliban by going to school every day in the North West and tribal areas. I have met young children with little money for books and pens but who run up mountains in Kashmir and walk miles in the searing desert heat of Sindh to go to school. There any many Malalas in Pakistan. But what Pakistan really needs right now is more men like Ziauddin Yousafzai. Without men like Ziauddin, there will be no women like Malala.","Ziauddin Yousafzai, the father of Malala, has been a huge influence on his daughter .

"(CNN) -- The United States and Venezuela don't agree on many foreign policy issues, but both countries say a newspaper report claiming that Iran is building a missile base in the South American nation is not credible. A group of engineers from an Iranian Revolutionary Guard-owned construction company has already visited the site of the secret joint project, the German newspaper Die Welt reported this month. If true, such a development would have the potential of creating an international crisis in the hemisphere. The reported site of the project, on the Paraguana Peninsula, is about 100 kilometers (62 miles) from a U.S. military site in Curacao, and about 120 kilometers (75 miles) from the Colombian border. The U.S. State Department said Saturday that it reviews all information pertaining to Iranian military involvement in the hemisphere, but that it could not vouch for the report. ""We have no evidence to support this claim and therefore no reason to believe the assertions made in the article are credible,"" the department said in a statement. In the wake of the questions raised by the report, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Nicolas Maduro described the allegations as an ""extravagant lie."" ""There is an international war machine against the prestige of Venezuelan democracy, against the prestige of the Bolivarian Revolution,"" Maduro said, referring to the country's social revolution. ""There is no other way to describe this information that has spread through international media and spokespeople, ex-(Venezuelan) servicemembers."" According to Die Welt, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad signed an agreement in October that included the development of a common medium-range missile. The goal, the paper reported, is to protect Venezuela from air attacks. Chavez in the past has accused the United States of plotting to invade his country. The alleged project includes the construction of a command-and-control center, watchtowers and bunkers in which warheads and rocket fuel can be stored, Die Welt reported. According to the story, Iran has paid tens of millions of dollars for the preliminary phase of the project. CNN has not independently confirmed the report. But the author of the article, Clemens Wergin, says his sources are credible. ""I can't say anything more than that they are sources from Western security circles with whom I have worked for 10 years, for which I believe they are credible,"" he told CNN en Español. ""My guess is that this is information that is interchanged in Western security circles."" Additional sources have confirmed his version following its publication, he said. Venezuelan Vice President Elias Jaua Milano denied the report. ""There does not exist any military installation from a foreign country,"" he said. Nonetheless, the report is causing waves in Venezuela. This week, the Venezuelan newspaper Nuevo Pais said it was occupied by order of the mayor of Libertador, a municipality in Caracas. The government told the paper it was expropriating the building where their newspaper is published, but the Inter-American Press Association says that the action was brought on because of the paper's content. Nuevo Pais had reprinted the story from Die Welt, the organization said. Repeated calls to Mayor Jorge Rodriguez were not returned. Maduro, the foreign minister, said that ""Venezuela does have plans to constitutionally and legally strengthen our armed forces, its defense capacity and our defense doctrine concept, doctrine of peace that never implies threats to any country in the continent or the world."" Foes of Iran, however, were not appeased by the Venezuelan statements. Avigdor Lieberman, foreign minister of Israel, said that his country has not independently confirmed the allegations, but called the report ""very serious."" ""It would be a military intervention in a Latin country, a development without precedent,"" he told CNN en Español. The Iranian government did not immediately comment on the veracity of the report. CNN's Fernando del Rincon, Jose Levy, Mariano Castillo, Arthur Brice and journalist Osmary Hernandez contributed to this report.","A German newspaper reports that a secret missile pact was signed .

"Hillary Clinton cribbed a page from President Barack Obama's playbook on Thursday by taking a swipe at Mitt Romney's 2008 oped, ""Let Detroit Go Bankrupt."" At an event outside Detroit, where the former secretary of state endorsed Democrats Mark Schauer and Gary Peters, Clinton spoke glowingly of their support for the 2008 auto bailout that invested billions into the United States struggling auto industry. ""Now, they could take the safe way, they could line up with those saying 'Let Detroit go bankrupt,' let manufacturing just wither away,"" Clinton said to a chorus of boos. ""They could be on the side of those who were criticizing what they called government motors."" Though Clinton never mentioned Romney by name, the comment appeared to be directed at him, as well as Schauer's and Peters' Republican opponents. Romney unsuccessfully ran for president in 2012 and famously wrote on opinion-editorial for The New York Times in 2008 that urged letting the big three auto companies -- General Motors, Ford and Chrysler -- go into a structured bankruptcy. ""If General Motors, Ford and Chrysler get the bailout that their chief executives asked for yesterday, you can kiss the American automotive industry goodbye,"" Romney wrote. ""It won't go overnight, but its demise will be virtually guaranteed."" Clinton voted in favor of the auto bailout when she returned to the Senate from her failed presidential campaign in 2008. Romney's editorial, though written years before, was a staple of the Obama attack against Romney in 2012. The campaign used the recovery of the auto industry to label the former Massachusetts governor as out-of-touch. Obama would regularly say that he ""refused to let Detroit go bankrupt."" Clinton's comments are particularly striking given the probability that she runs for president and the recent chatter that Romney will try to run for president for a third time. ""We'll see what happens,"" Romney told New York Times Magazine last month. His wife, Ann Romney, told CNN earlier today that she is still ""done"" with the idea of another presidential bid, but adds ""you know, you never do say never."" Clinton used more of her speech to talk about the auto industry and the decision to approve a bailout. ""They,"" Clinton said, referring to people who wanted the companies go into bankruptcy, ""were willing to walk away from the people of this state, the jobs, the auto industry, the future."" Later she added, ""There are some choices that define career and define what people are made out of. There are choices that shape your whole life. This was a choice that would change the future of an industry, a state and a nation.""","Hillary Clinton knocks those who wanted to ""Let Detroit go bankrupt""

"(CNN) -- Amenah Ibrahim vividly remembers her first introduction to thermodynamics. It was her freshman year at the University of Illinois at Chicago, and she sat in a large auditorium filled with students aspiring to degrees in chemical engineering. ""The first thing the (professor) told us was, 'You should expect to see this class dwindle down as the semester goes on.' It was the first thing they told us,"" she said. Ibrahim said the professor's expectation came true. As the semester progressed, students began to drop the class, some switching to other majors entirely. Ibrahim hung on, although it took her five years and three summer sessions to complete her bachelor's degree in chemical engineering. ""I was a very persistent and resilient person,"" Ibrahim said. ""I remember bombing my first calculus exam, and I could have dropped. If it wasn't for my (persistence), I could have seen that score and said, 'Well, maybe this isn't for me.'"" Undergraduates across the country are choosing to leave science, technology, engineering and math programs before they graduate with those degrees. Many students in those STEM fields struggle to complete their degrees in four years, or drop out, according to a 2010 University of California, Los Angeles, study. The study, conducted by UCLA's Higher Education Research Institute, found students in science, math and engineering take longer to complete their degrees than students who start out majoring in other fields. The study tracked thousands of students who entered college for the first time in 2004. Thirty-six percent of white, 21% of black and 22% of Latino undergraduate students in STEM fields finished their bachelor's degrees in STEM fields within five years of initial enrollment. Nearly 22% dropped out after five years. Low graduation rates among science and math undergraduates affect how the United States competes globally. Fewer biology and math majors means fewer doctors and engineers later. How to stop America's math, science lag . In President Barack Obama's State of the Union speech this year, he said science, technology, engineering and math will guide the country's future, and education improvements are needed. ""Maintaining our leadership in research and technology is crucial to America's success ... if we want innovation to produce jobs in America and not overseas, then we also have to win the race to educate our kids,"" Obama said. James Brown, executive director of the STEM Education Coalition, said a big problem is that educators don't often realize the urgency of fostering the next generation of American scientists and engineers. ""People who follow this issue understand the connection between a STEM workforce and national competitiveness. But that's not enough,"" Brown said. ""Universities and faculty have to understand this is a national priority."" 'Sink or Swim' Sylvia Hurtado, director of the Higher Education Research Institute and one of the UCLA study's authors, said high school seniors are interested in pursuing science, math and engineering degrees more than ever. But research shows that most don't make it to the finish line. ""Many students want to be in science, but very talented people are choosing other fields. That shouldn't be the case,"" Hurtado said. ""It's important to understand how we close this gap."" Poor scientific literacy among college students is one reason students pursuing science and math are less likely to graduate from those programs. High school graduates aren't prepared for first-year science classes in college, Hurtado said. But there's another problem, too: Higher education, itself. Science and math programs are designed and taught to winnow down the number of students. University tenure systems often reward professors who conduct research and publish their work, but not those who teach well. Among students who majored in liberal arts, business or other fields, 73% of white students and about 63% of black and Latino students finished their degrees in five years. Forty-one percent of American students who start off majoring in science, math, engineering or technology fields graduate from those programs within six years. More collaborative and supportive environments for STEM students are one of the solutions to the problem, Hurtado said. One girl's academic success defies all expectations -- even her dad's . Ibrahim, the University of Illinois student, said her classes were all ""sink or swim."" ""There were not a lot of resources to develop interest in students,"" Ibrahim said. (Professors) say, 'Here's the workload, if you can handle it, you're good to go. If not, sorry.' "" When Lena Groeger majored in biology at Brown University, working one-on-one with a science professor was key to maintaining her interest in the field, she said. She managed to finish her bachelor's degree in four years. ""I had a really good experience majoring in biology because my junior year, I did an independent study with a professor,"" Groeger said. ""It was great to have the freedom to do that."" Freeman Hrabowski, president of The University of Maryland Baltimore County, said American attitudes toward science are hurting STEM graduation rates. ""We in America have accepted that science is just not for everybody. We send messages to students all the time that, 'This is not really for you,' "" he said. ""One of the reasons American (students) aren't more excited about science is that adults themselves aren't excited. Most (students) have been weeded out before they even get to college."" Hrabowski said many people assume they're not smart enough to study science or math. His response? ""No. Your teacher wasn't innovative enough."" Changing the culture . Schools admit more science majors than they expect to graduate, and don't teach students to support each other, Hrabowski said, instead fostering an atmosphere of cutthroat competition. ""We say, 'If we accept you in science, you have ability to do it, and we'll help you succeed,' "" Hrabowski said. ""What has made the difference at UMBC is the way we encourage group work and teachers to rethink their approach in the classroom. The results are significantly more students are succeeding."" The University of Maryland Baltimore County puts an emphasis on research, Hrabowski said. The university has space for biotechnology companies that can work with students on campus. The school's curriculum emphasizes student collaboration and research projects that require students to solve real-world problems. Hurtado, the UCLA researcher, said the school has earned a reputation for solid completion rates in science and math fields, especially among black students. In 2010, U.S. News and World Report ranked it first among ""up-and-coming schools,"" and gave it a high rank for undergraduate teaching and undergrad engineering programs. Opinion: Why liberal arts matter . ""We need more supportive programs and less sorting,"" Hurtado said. ""The most important practice in terms of sustaining interest among students is faculty involvement in research programs that connect students and give them a feel for what it's like to be a scientist."" Ibrahim said research was an elective class during her undergraduate years, and nobody encouraged her to pursue it. With little mentorship made available, it was easy to become discouraged. ""My parents didn't go to college and I didn't have a support system,"" Ibrahim said. ""There were no (students) ahead of me in the program who could give me encouragement. It's very difficult to do it alone, without a support system."" After taking five years to graduate with her bachelor's degree, Ibrahim went on to get a master's degree in science and engineering and now works as a chemical engineer for PepsiCo, as part of the team developing advancements in the sports drink, Gatorade. ""I chose to keep going,"" she said.","Science and math students struggle to complete their degrees in four years, if at all .
Researchers say higher education must ""weed out"" students .
More and better prepared science and tech students keep the U.S. competitive."
"(CNN) -- A group calling itself the ""Iran cyber army"" claimed responsibility Tuesday for hacking into a number of Voice of America internet pages, according to reports from both Voice of America and Iran's semi-official Fars News Agency. The group displayed a message on Voice of America's Farsi page, calling for an end to U.S. ""interference"" in the Muslim world. ""Ms. Clinton, do you want to hear the oppressed voices of nations from the heart of America?"" the group asked. ""The Muslim world does not believe in U.S. deceit. We tell you, stop intervening in Muslim countries."" The action was taken ""in response to the propagation of lies and plots of anti-revolutionary sites,"" Fars reported, claiming that a total of 95 sites affiliated with Voice of America were hacked. Fars said that Voice of America acts as ""part of the United States' spying organizations."" Voice of America indicated that the cyber attack may have been launched in response to a recent ABC interview with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. During the interview, Clinton referenced the State Department's opening of Twitter accounts in Arabic and Farsi, stating, ""We want to be joining young people who, like young Americans, seek their right to express their views."" Voice of America noted that websites in other languages -- including Azeri, Dari, Pashtun, and Urdu -- were also targeted by the hackers. The Iranian government is among a number of regimes in the broader Middle East and Muslim world targeted by protesters in recent weeks. Thousands of security officers cracked down on landmark sites in Iran's capital and other major cities Sunday, striking at throngs of protesters with batons and rushing others on motorcycles, according to witnesses.","Voice of America web pages have been hacked by an Iranian group .

"The last 12 months have seen Tiger Woods climb back to the top of the golf rankings, and now the 14-time major winner has reclaimed his crown as the world's highest-paid athlete. Forbes estimates Woods' earnings for the 12 months to June 1 this year total $78.1 million, putting him ahead of tennis ace Roger Federer -- who topped the 2012 list. The top 10 features two golfers, three soccer players, two NFL quarterbacks, two NBA stars and one tennis player. The 100-strong list compiled by the influential business magazine features just three women, the highest-ranked of which is world No. 2 tennis player Maria Sharapova in 22nd place with earnings of $22 million. Woods has started 2013 in fine form, winning four PGA Tour titles so far this year. The 37-year-old pocketed $13.1 million in winnings over the last 12 months. He has also cashed in on appearances fees, collecting over $10 million for playing in Abu Dhabi, China, Malaysia and Turkey. Federer has won more grand slams than any other male tennis player in history with 17. The Swiss had total earnings last year of $71.5 million -- $14 million of which came from playing six exhibition events during a tour of South America. Like Woods, Federer earns an estimated $65 million through endorsements, and both players are long-term members of Nike's stable of athletes. According to his agent Mark Steinberg, Woods is close to signing a new deal with the American sportswear giant. NBA icons Kobe Bryant and LeBron James are third and fourth on the list respectively. Bryant's salary with the Los Angeles Lakers is the highest in basketball at $27.85 million a year, $7 million more than any other player. Miami Heat's ""King James"" earns $42 million from endorsements with major companies like Nike, McDonald's, Coca Cola and Samsung. Quarterbacks Drew Brees of the New Orleans Saints and the Green Bay Packers' Aaron Rodgers benefited from lucrative playing contracts worth $100 million and $110 million respectively. Golf's Hall of Famer Phil Mickelson is seventh on the list after making $48.7 million, with soccer trio David Beckham, Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi completing the top 10. Former England captain Beckham recently ended his playing career with a five-month spell at French side Paris Saint-Germain. The $5.2 million salary he was paid during that time was donated to charity. Beckham took home $47.2 million, profiting from commercial deals with Adidas, H & M and Samsung.

"A blinking dinosaur eye. A nod to Eminem. A crude effort at connecting friends and ""friends of friends."" Were these the awkward first steps toward a multibillion-dollar social media empire? Some online sleuths think so, saying that a newly unearthed Angelfire page from 1999 appears to be the first website ever created by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. ""Hi, my name is...Slim Shady,"" the site's creator wrote on its ""About Me"" page, referencing an Eminem song released that same year. ""No, really, my name is Slim Shady. Just kidding, my name is Mark."" Mark describes himself as 15 years old, having just completed his freshman year of high school in ""a small town near the massive city of New York."" All those details match up with Facebook's billionaire CEO, as does the source code on the site's main page that lists ""Mark Zuckerberg"" as its creator. The quaintly outdated and charmingly awkward site (witness the creepy animated eye on its home page) showed up Wednesday in a post on Hacker News, the news-sharing site associated with startup incubator Y Combinator. Immediately, would-be profilers went to work looking for glimpses of a future Web titan in the posts of a teen who liked quesadillas, lasers and making fun of his buddies. Many pointed to The Web, an app with the name ""Mark"" in a red box at the center. The creator asks friends to add themselves, then two of their own friends. Those friends can then add two friends of their own, in theory creating an ever-growing network of friends and acquaintances. Sound familiar? Then, there's The Vader Fader. It's a tool to fade text in AOL chat, text and e-mails. ""This is a fader that I made when I was a little bored and somewhat inspired on a long weekend in between finals,"" the creator writes. ""... So take advantage of this fader and tell your friends to download it as well!"" So, is it really Zuckerberg? There are some pretty convincing signs that it might be. Our favorite comes at the very bottom of the ""Vader Fader"" page. The second update of the tool got a new name: ""Zuck Fader."" The folks at Motherboard, a tech and science site launched by VICE, tracked the e-mail address listed on the site -- Themarke51@aol.com -- back to an account holder with the same screen name that Dr. Edward Zuckerberg, Mark's father, uses frequently. The source code on the site's main page suggests that it was, in fact, created in 1999. It's hosted on Angelfire's ""ny"" subdomain for sites in New York state, where Zuckerberg grew up in suburban Westchester County. ""It could also be some strange, quasi-elaborate hoax meant to embarass Zuck with Eminem references and a silly game called 'Cow-a-bungee,'"" Adam Clark Estes wrote for Motherboard. ""But there's a lot of compelling evidence that this thing is legit.""

"Critics of the cease-fire reached Wednesday between Hamas and Israel argue that little has changed. For now, they say, the Egypt-brokered de-escalation has merely placed a Band-Aid over a seeping wound, restoring the status quo established after Israel's Operation Cast Lead offensive of late 2008. Certainly, we may well see the return of airstrikes and rockets; the truce represents only a small first step toward a more durable solution. The nature of the agreement, however, points to a clear ""Arab Spring truth"" and a significant shift in regional dynamics: The international isolation of Hamas has ended. The influence exercised by Egypt, Turkey and Qatar was clearly instrumental in delivering this cease-fire. The role of Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy, in particular, has been praised by Hamas political leader Khaled Meshaal and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton alike, with the latter commending Egypt's government for ""assuming responsibility and leadership"" in de-escalating the crisis. Toward the end of 2011, Hamas' departure from Damascus was sealed when Meshaal refused to denounce the uprising against his former host and sponsor, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. With its regional base and Iranian funding in jeopardy, Hamas has increasingly turned to its fellow Sunni allies in Egypt, Turkey and Qatar. The degree of influence that this troika of Arab Spring playmakers has over Hamas' leaders, however, was revealed only by the recent crisis. The absence in negotiations of the Palestinian Authority and its president, Mahmoud Abbas, was telling. It shows that in a post-revolution Middle East, engagement with Hamas on its own is both feasible and tempting. Opinion: How to prevent the next clash with Hamas . In this respect, however, the Egyptian president missed the opportunity to get Abbas and Meshaal working together and further stalled efforts at Palestinian unity. That is the demand of the overwhelming majority of Palestinians. To be sure, Iran still has an important role to play with Hamas. Alongside Egypt -- and, remarkably, the U.S. -- Meshaal recognized on Wednesday the importance of Iran's contribution to his movement's efforts (in the field of resistance, rather than resolution). He praised Tehran for providing the group with arms and financial support, despite ""differences between Iran and Hamas on issues connected with the conflict in Syria."" In this respect, however, he is walking a fine line with his regional backers in order to keep his regional options open. It is worth remembering that Hamas is not a monolithic entity. Some within the movement are more focused on resistance, while others are focused on governance, reconciling with Fatah and reining in independent Gaza-based militants. This is something I heard privately in January 2011 in Gaza and subsequently when talking to some of Hamas' senior political officials. The international community -- and Israel -- should work with the newly emerged regional troika of Egypt-Turkey-Qatar to engage with Hamas and strengthen Hamas's pragmatic wing. Given the strength of its ties, though, Iran could still prove to be a spoiling influence. This initiative, as specified by Clinton, should focus on steps toward ""a just and lasting peace."" Let us hope that the past week or so has renewed the Obama administration's drive to achieve Israeli-Palestinian peace. In the short term, this means pushing for Palestinian unity around a negotiating position and ending the blockade on Gaza, both of which the Qatari emir stressed in his landmark trip to Gaza last month. The continuation of this blockade helps no one, and the destitution it imposes on Gazans has only further radicalized much of the largely young population. About 80% of Gaza's households live on less than $2 a day, while 1.3 million or 80% of its citizens receive some form of food aid. No wonder the U.N. recently declared that under current circumstances, the strip would be unlivable by 2020, citing shortages of food, water electricity, jobs, hospital beds and classrooms. Opinion: Israel, engage Abbas now . If such conditions continue, Hamas may well resort to further rocket attacks against Israel's southern communities or turn a blind eye to other groups launching such terror attacks. Groups such as Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades and the small but growing number of Salafi groups that have agreed to the cease-fire will pose a challenge to Hamas' authority, especially if there is no progress on the ground. These international efforts begin with the implementation of the admittedly shaky cease-fire. Egypt has emphasized the importance of effectively ending the blockade on Gaza -- one of the conditions of the cease-fire document. In the post-Cast Lead border arrangement, Israel retained significant veto powers over the passage of people and the flow of goods through Egypt's border crossings with Gaza. The new Egypt, however, has stressed the importance of formalizing the free flow of goods into and out of Gaza. In doing so, it wants to diminish the role of the ""informal"" tunnel economy, which, while generating large amounts of revenue for Hamas, has helped create an unstable situation in the Sinai badlands. If Israel now fails to deliver on its responsibilities regarding the conditions of the cease-fire, it risks not only a return to conflict but also losing the good will of Morsy.","In post-revolution Middle East, engagement with Hamas is feasible, Salman Shaikh says .
Influence of Egypt, Turkey and Qatar was instrumental in delivering cease-fire, he says .
Maintaining Gaza blockade only serves to further radicalize Gaza's population, he says .

"A $1.1 trillion compromise spending bill that funds the government through September won approval Wednesday from the Republican-led U.S. House and now goes to the Senate for consideration. The appropriations measure, approved 359-to-67, would roll back some past spending cuts, raise federal worker pay and touch the everyday life of all Americans. Compromise on the fiscal year 2014 spending bill is a break from years of congressional funding fights that included a government shutdown last October. The Senate is expected to also pass the so-called ""omnibus"" bill and send it to President Barack Obama to be signed into law. Wielding the power of one of the biggest purses in the world, the measure sets America's national and international priorities. In the partisan atmosphere of an election year, the spending bill may be the largest policy decision Congress makes in 2014. It calls for 1% increases in the paychecks of federal workers and military personnel, the first raises in three years for most agency workers. The spending measure also would protect disabled veterans and some military spouses from a pension cut set to go into effect in 2015. Appeal for both sides . Democrats like a $1 billion increase in Head Start funding for early childhood education from its recent low point after forced budget cuts last year. Half of the money will go to help children 3 years old and younger, touching on an Obama administration priority. For Republicans, the compromise reduces funding to two of their least-favorite agencies -- the Internal Revenue Service and the Environmental Protection Agency. Overall, federal spending would be lower than the final budget of President George W. Bush's administration. Changes at the airports may be the most visible Republican idea in the bill. The measure launches several policies aimed at forcing the Transportation Security Administration to get more low-risk passengers through security more quickly. Obamacare mostly untouched . Obama's signature health care reforms avoided any harsh cuts sought by conservative Republicans hoping to dismantle the 2010 Affordable Care Act. On another controversy, the spending plan requires Secretary of State John Kerry to certify the Libyan government is helping find those responsible for the 2012 attack that killed four Americans in Benghazi before any more foreign aid goes to the country. The bill also contains countless smaller provisions such as a ban on funding any new portraits of most officials. Current funding under a continuing resolution that extended spending at previous levels expires on Wednesday, and Congress passed a further three-day extension to give the Senate time to vote on the compromise 2014 bill later this week. Obama later signed the stopgap measure, which will fund the federal government through Saturday.","The appropriations bill now goes to the Senate for consideration .

"A group claiming to be Saudi Arabian hackers is posting the credit card information and other identifying data of thousands of Israelis online, prompting an international investigation. The group first posted a message Tuesday, which included claims that 400,000 credit card numbers had been published. ""Hi, it's OxOmar from group-xp, largest Wahhabi hacker group of Saudi Arabia,"" read a statement posted on an Israeli sports website the group hacked into. ""We are anonymous Saudi Arabian hackers. We decided to release first part of our data about Israel."" The Bank of Israel released a statement Tuesday saying that based on information from credit card companies, only about 15,000 credit card numbers were exposed, and those cards were blocked for use in Internet and telephone purchases. Thursday, the group claimed to have released another 11,000 credit card numbers and threatened to publish many more. Yoram Hacohen, the head of the Israeli Law, Information and Technology Authority at the Israeli Ministry of Justice, told CNN in a phone interview Friday he's more concerned about the private information that was released, not the credit card numbers. The publishing of information such as e-mail addresses, phone numbers, home addresses and passwords could lead to identification theft, he said. Hacohen said the hacking is a criminal act against citizens of the world, since some of the information exposed belongs to Jews worldwide, not only Israelis. Israeli authorities have begun a criminal investigation, including a computer forensic probe to search for electronic evidence to try to locate the group, Hacohen said.  The theft of personal information is a criminal act under Israel's Privacy Protection Law. He acknowledged that in the digital world, offenders are very difficult to track, and authorities are asking for international help in the matter. ""The peculiar incident we are facing could be a bad joke, a youthful prank, a hate-driven terror attack for beginners or the cellars of the Iranian intelligence in Tehran,"" wrote Israeli columnist Ben Caspit in the Maariv newspaper Friday, outlining the difficulties of trying to identify the hackers. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu created a National Cyber Headquarters in May 2011, noting the emergence of cyber attacks that could ""potentially paralyze life systems -- electricity, communications, credit cards, water, transportation, traffic lights."" He said in December that the new agency -- along with a rocket defense system and a physical fence -- would help protect Israel against its enemies. An official with the prime minister's office said the National Cyber Headquarters is currently in the process of being set up.","The hackers claim to be from Saudi Arabia .

"A little over 26 years ago, Mohammad Reza Najafi started manufacturing auto parts in Iran. Today he's an industry leader, supplying roughly three million springs and one million break-pads every year to Iranian auto makers. Najafi's success has also earned him seats on the country's Chamber of Commerce and the board of directors of the Iranian Auto Parts Manufacturers Association. It has also made him a leading voice in Iran's efforts to re-energize its struggling economy. Like many of his country's business leaders, Najafi has watched the recent negotiations with world powers on Iran's nuclear program with great interest. He spoke to CNN's Reza Sayah on this week's Marketplace Middle East, sharing his thoughts on how he sees the talks panning out and the impact they will have on the Iranian economy going forward. Reza Sayah (RS): What was your reaction when they couldn't reach a deal (on the nuclear issue)? Mohammad Reza Najafi (MRN): As a matter of fact it was a deal but naturally it takes time and we are happy that it is continuing. RS: Would you agree that Iran's economy is not going to improve without the sanctions being lifted? MRN: It's a very difficult question to answer because at the same time during the sanctions we tried to find our own way to improve ourselves and so on. But we are interested to collaborate with them (the international community) so it is an obstacle that should be removed. RS: Tell me about Iran's economy today, where does it stand? MRN: These three months of the year, the first quarter of the Iranian year, the international trade has increased from $18.5 billion to $24.5 billion. We hope after removing the sanctions then we'll have at least 6% growth in the economy of the country and at least 10% growth in the industrial (sector). RS: Iran is still dependent on oil exports. That's been almost halved because of the sanctions. Then we have the banking sanctions. How can Iran's economy thrive if they're cut off from the banking system? MRN: The banking system is one of the main points that we hope will be removed very soon. We have found our own way but the best way is to go through the normal way where the cost is much lower and it is more normal. RS: Do you sense over this past year when relations have thawed with the west that investors and businessmen and women want to come to Iran to invest? MRN: Exactly, after and even before this we see a lot of delegations come from all over the world. All of them are ready, they are interested, they are eager to come here and work with us. RS: Iran's position is they have made enough concessions, that they're nuclear program is open for inspections. Even so, a deal wasn't struck. Why are you so optimistic that eventually a deal will happen? MRN: For sure it will happen. Why? Because we are a peaceful people. We have a capable country. We have more than four million students at university. We have the natural resources. We are ready and we are open for collaboration with the world. And we hope that with collaboration everybody will have the interest out of it and it will be a win-win play.","Mohammad Reza Najafi is one of Iran's foremost businesspeople .

"At the end of the APEC trade summit in China, U.S. President Barack Obama announced a climate change agreement with Chinese President Xi Jinping that would cut both countries' greenhouse gas emissions by close to a third over the next two decades. Under the deal, the United States would cut its carbon emissions between 26-28% -- from levels established in 2005 -- by 2025. China would peak its carbon emissions no later than 2030 and would also increase the use of non-fossil fuels to 20% by 2030. ""As the world's two largest economies, energy consumers and emitters of greenhouse gases, we have a special responsibility to lead the global effort against climate change,"" Obama said Wednesday in a joint press conference with Xi. Obama said he hopes the announcement will spur other nations to tackle climate change. ""We hope to encourage all major economies to be ambitious -- all countries, developing and developed -- to work across some of the old divides, so we can conclude a strong global climate agreement next year,"" Obama said. The White House said the ultimate target is to ""achieve deep economy-wide reductions on the order of 80% by 2050."" A senior administration official calls the goals both  ""ambitious and achievable,"" but also acknowledged that U.S. domestic politics could put a damper on the announcement.  Saying ""leading climate deniers"" in the GOP might try to stop the initiative,  the official hinted the President may act alone if necessary. ""Congress may try to stop us, but we believe that with control of Congress changing hands we can proceed with the authority we already have."" The official added, ""This is really the crusade of a narrow group of people who are politically motivated and have made this a cause celebre, but we believe we will be successful."" The administration hopes to sell the plan back home by touting the anticipated savings on energy costs. ""Consumers and businesses will save literally billions of dollars"" a senior administration official said. The plan offers initiatives and incentives to develop more solar and wind power across both countries, the official said. Another official said the agreement ""won't all fall together in five minutes,"" but hopes this will demonstrate to other nations that working together to reduce carbon emissions would prove that ""we can work together to enhance deployment of sustainable clean technologies."" The White House said the announcement marks the first time China has agreed to cut its carbon emissions, and said the Chinese are calling for ""an energy revolution"" that would include a broad economic reform program that would address air pollution. China has agreed to provide an ""additional 800-1,000 gigawatts of nuclear, wind, solar and other zero emission generation capacity by 2030, more than all the coal-fired power plants that exist in China today and close to total current electricity generation capacity in . During Obama's visit, the Chinese government closed factories and gave employees time off to reduce car traffic and, ultimately, emissions in Beijing. The reduction of smog and the appearance of blue skies was noted by media throughout the APEC Summit. Another senior administration official said that historically, the United States and China have often been seen as antagonists, so this ""should send a powerful message,"" and ""will usher in a new day, where the U.S. and China can work as partners."" On top of historic climate change agreement, Obama and Xi also agreed on the importance of cybersecurity, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, strengthening military relations and increasing trade.","Obama: We have a special responsibility to lead the effort against climate change .

"HBO's hot new anthology drama True Detectives opened solid in the ratings Sunday night, while comedy Girls returned to a series-high audience. Despite facing the Golden Globe Awards, HBO's freshman drama debut had 2.3 million viewers — the biggest HBO series opening since Boardwalk Empire in 2010, and just barely edging out the series premiere of Game of Thrones from 2011. True Detective's first replay added another million viewers to the tally. True Detective stars Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey as Louisiana detectives hunting a serial killer. Check out Jeff Jensen's in-depth analysis of the first episode. Meanwhile Girls returned to a series-high 1.1 million viewers, up 28 percent from the season 2 debut. Guess that TCA question #ragespiral fight about Lena Dunham's nudity didn't hurt the show's popularity (and might have even helped). EW's recap here. Though it might seem odd to launch a sophisticated premium drama like True Detective against an event like the Globes, the awards show draws fewer viewers than a major prime-time football game — which is what HBO faces most weeks this time of year.

"(CNN) -- Iran has brought down a U.S. ""spy drone"" flying near its Fordo nuclear enrichment plant in Qom province, state-run media reported Wednesday. The date of the incident has not been disclosed, and three U.S. officials said there was no indication or information that a U.S. drone was downed. State-run Press TV reported the development, citing a Tuesday story from another website -- javanonline.ir. Ali Aqazadeh Dafsari, an Iranian lawmaker, said air defense units of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps shot down the drone, Press TV reported, citing javanonline.ir . Dafsari, who is a member of parliament's National Security and Foreign Policy Committee, said that the craft was on a mission to identify the plant's location and collect information about the facility for the CIA. The development emerged as the Iranian government announced on Tuesday that it was installing a new generation of centrifuges in its nuclear facilities. The French Foreign Ministry called the development ""a new wave of provocation"" that flouts United Nations resolutions. Iran's development of missile and nuclear fuel technology has led to U.N. sanctions and accusations from the United States that the clerical regime is trying to develop nuclear weapons. Iran says it has a right to peaceful nuclear technology. The U.N. nuclear agency has said it cannot verify whether the intent of Tehran's nuclear program remains peaceful.

"Another top Iranian official weighed in Wednesday about the tensions brewing between his country and the United States, the latest salvo in the war of words over the Strait of Hormuz and the Persian Gulf. ""We have always stated that there is no need for the forces belonging to the countries beyond this region to have a presence in the Persian Gulf,"" Brig. Gen. Ahmad Vahidi said Wednesday, the semiofficial Fars News Agency reported. ""Their presence does nothing but create mayhem, and we never wanted them to be present in the Persian Gulf."" His statement is the latest rhetoric stemming from Iran's threat last week to close the strategically important Strait of Hormuz. The strait, the only outlet from the Persian Gulf, is a critical shipping lane, with 17 million barrels of oil per day passing through in 2011, according to the U.S. Energy Information Agency. Iran threatened to block the strait if sanctions were imposed on its oil exports. France, Britain and Germany have proposed sanctions to punish Iran's lack of cooperation on its nuclear program. Cmdr. Amy Derrick Frost, spokeswoman for the U.S. 5th Fleet based in Bahrain, responded at the time, ""Anyone who threatens to disrupt freedom of navigation in an international strait is clearly outside the community of nations; any disruption will not be tolerated."" Answering a reporter's question Wednesday about the closing of the strait, Vahidi said, ""The security of the Strait of Hormuz is one of the issues that Iran is concerned with, and the Islamic Republic has been maintaining this security."" He emphasized that Iran is a regional power and will always protect the strait. ""Of course the enemies try to exaggerate this issue in order to secure weapons sales to the countries of this region,"" he said. Vahidi said a number of observers from other countries had been present during Iran's recent military exercises in and around the strait, and suggested that Iran could hold joint maneuvers with neighboring countries, Fars said. Iran warned the United States on Tuesday not to return a U.S. aircraft carrier group ""to the Persian Gulf region."" Maj. Gen. Ataollah Salehi, commander of Iran's army, said his country ""will not adopt any irrational move, but it is ready to severely react against any threat,"" the Islamic Republic News Agency said. U.S. officials rejected the warning. The commander spoke at the Port of Chabahar in southern Iran, as forces held a military parade the day after Iran ended naval drills in the region, IRNA reported. The USS John C. Stennis, part of the U.S. Navy's fleet in the region, moved last week from the Persian Gulf into the North Arabian Sea as part of what the 5th Fleet called a preplanned transit. Iran said the ship's movement in relation to Iran's naval exercises showed that the United States ""understood"" that Iran's maneuvers were not ""suicidal or aggressive,"" but rather about Iran protecting its own ""interests and power."" But Western diplomats last week described the naval drills -- which, according to Iranian officials, included test-firing missiles -- as further evidence of Iran's volatile behavior. Iran's naval exercises began in the strait and also included waters in the Sea of Oman and the Indian Ocean up to the Gulf of Aden, according to IRNA. After Tuesday's warning from Iran, a Pentagon spokesman issued a statement saying ""deployment of U.S. military assets in the Persian Gulf region will continue as it has for decades."" The United States has had forces in the Persian Gulf since World War II. Its ships sail through the Persian Gulf frequently, many on their way to and from the 5th Fleet's headquarters in Bahrain. The 5th Fleet's area of responsibility covers about 2.5 million square miles, including the Persian Gulf, which the Navy also refers to as the Arabian Gulf; the Red Sea; the Gulf of Oman; and parts of the Indian Ocean.","Iran's defense minister speaks out over U.S. warship .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Julius Derico Jr. didn't need to travel to the Vietnam Memorial Wall in Washington to pay tribute to his fallen comrade -- the first casualty of his unit in Vietnam. Users can search the digitized Vietnam War Memorial Wall for details about soldiers who died. As he huddled around a computer with other veterans, he searched for his friend's name in a newly digitized version of the Wall. While it's just one of the Wall's 58,320 names, Derico said he hopes people understand that it represents something more than just an inscription. The virtual Wall, a project created by the National Archives and Footnote.com, brings the memorial to millions of American homes. The Web site, unveiled last week, links names to casualty reports, historical documents and digital photographs, and allows users to leave online tributes to those who died.  See the new project be unveiled in Washington » . To create the digital image, photographers used more than 6,000 photographs of the Wall, which measures about 460 feet wide. Ten Vietnam veterans at an American Legion Post 911 in Atlanta, Georgia, gathered to test the online Wall for CNN.com. They said they believe the new Wall gives a face to each of the names, and helps keep their memories alive.  See veterans react to the virtual memorial » . ""We can use that to help console people ... To help people realize that ... they are gone but they are not forgotten,"" Derico said. ""We can show it to you [online]. Your brother, your sister ... They're still there; they are being thought of and they are being treated with due respect."" Derico will never forget. The thought of that first death in his unit still chokes him up. David Perkett was killed one night when a fellow soldier accidentally discharged his weapon. At the age of 20, Derico had to identify the body. It was not prepped. It was not cleaned. His comrade was covered in dried blood. ""It was devastating,"" Derico said, visibly shaken. As some people searched the virtual Wall for people they knew, others shouted names from across the room, hoping someone would enter a search in the computer. Some only knew the first names and hoped to match them with the database by unit or hometown. As they found more names, the group grew in size, huddling closer together as they read the casualty report of the latest name. For Robert Love, who served in Vietnam as a mechanic, being able to view the Wall with fellow comrades gives the memorial new meaning. As he used the online version, he reflected on a trip to Washington, where he visited the Wall. ""I had so many different emotions; and then after a while, as you begin to look at the names on the wall, it overwhelms you,"" he said. ""Then you realize that you could be up there, but by the grace of God you aren't."" As he sat with his fellow servicemen Friday, reflecting on the war and sharing memories of those who died, some of the pain eased.   See how users are turning the wall into a personal scrapbook » . As they located familiar names and learned more about them, the group's excitement grew. Everyone agreed that other veterans should know about the site, and they agreed to spread the word. Some suggested including the site Stand Down -- an event that helps homeless and indigent veterans by providing them with food, clothing and other necesseties. So many veterans end up with no home, no benefits, no money and drug problems, Love said. Many are simply stuck in a cycle, unable to let go of the horror of war. ""War is hell. There's no other way to put it. And when an individual goes into a situation where he or she takes the life of another individual, it's devastating and you never really get over it,"" he said. ""At times, when you go to sleep at night, you see just like you were there. You wake up in a cold sweat -- scared; and after so long it starts wearing on your body."" ""It's an excellent opportunity for them to come in and look back on what happened to them in Vietnam,"" Derico said. ""For them to look back on the people they lost in Vietnam. And guess what?

"A man jumped a fence at the White House late Friday and made it through the North Portico doors into the building before he was captured, Secret Service spokesman Brian Leary told CNN. Part of the White House was evacuated after a disturbance was initially detected on the North Lawn, according to a CNN reporter who was among those hustled from the building. The first family was not at the White House at the time, but other people were. President Obama had left just four minutes earlier with his daughters via helicopter from the South Lawn to visit Camp David. The suspect, 42-year-old Omar Gonzalez of Copperas Cove, Texas, was apprehended just after making it inside the doors. He was taken to George Washington Medical Center for a medical evaluation, Leary said. Gonzalez was known to Secret Service, said an official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The official would not say how or why. He had not been arrested by the Secret Service before. ""He appeared to responding officers to be unarmed, and that turned out to be true. He ignored officers' calls for him to stop and ran towards the White House,"" Leary said. It's unclear how Gonzalez made his way onto the grounds. A CNN crew saw Secret Service agents standing over what appeared to be a man on the North Portico. A man believed to be the suspect was later seen being loaded onto an ambulance. More than an hour later, Secret Service agents and dogs were seen standing near where the disturbance occurred. CNN White House producer Becky Brittain said she has never been evacuated off White House grounds in her nine years of reporting there.

"The U.S. Coast Guard fired at an Iranian fishing dhow in the Persian Gulf after the Iranian boat pointed a machine gun at the American crew, the Navy said on Tuesday. The incident occurred earlier in the day when a team from the Coast Guard patrol vessel Monomoy was dispatched in a smaller boat ""to query the Iranian dhow"" in international waters, the Navy said in a statement. ""The dhow's crew trained and prepared to fire a .50 caliber machine gun on their small boat as it approached as part of a routine maritime security operation,"" the Navy statement said. ""This action by the dhow's crew demonstrated hostile intent,"" prompting the Coast Guard crew to turn away and then fire one round ""in self defense,"" the Navy said. Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said there was no indication whether the dhow was struck. The Navy statement said the dhow crew did not respond when fired upon and left the scene without communicating with the Monomoy. Earlier, the Monomoy had established communication with the dhow and determined that it was an Iranian-flagged vessel, the Navy said, adding that it subsequently refused to communicate further. No U.S. personnel were harmed and the small boat's crew returned safely to the Monomoy, the Navy statement said. The Coast Guard is in the gulf operating with the Navy's Fifth Fleet.

"Iran will not return an unmanned American stealth plane that it says it has, one of Iran's top generals said, according to the semi-official Fars news agency on Sunday. ""No nation welcomes other countries' spy drones in its territory, and no one sends back the spying equipment and its information back to the country of origin,"" said Gen. Hossein Salami, deputy commander of the Armed Forces. ""It makes no difference where this drone originated and which group or country sent it to invade our air space,"" Salami said. ""This was an act of invasion and belligerence."" American officials have not confirmed that the drone in a video released Thursday is a U.S. aircraft, but Pentagon spokesman George Little has said that an American drone is missing and had not been recovered as of Thursday. But two U.S. officials confirmed to CNN on Tuesday that the missing drone was part of a CIA reconnaissance mission that involved both the intelligence community and military personnel stationed in Afghanistan. Iran's official Iran Republic News Agency said the country's armed forces had downed the drone near Kashmar, some 225 kilometers (140 miles) from the border with Afghanistan on December 4. Salami said downing the plane was ""very valuable for us"" and ""a victory for us and a defeat for our enemies,"" IRNA reported. He also claimed Iran had downed other drones earlier but had not announced those instances because they were not as important. Iranian TV aired images Thursday of what it says is the drone, an apparently intact RQ-170 drone propped on a pedestal and triumphantly displayed. There was disagreement among Pentagon officials about whether the drone in the video was real. Military and intelligence officials were analyzing the Iran television footage. One U.S. official said the United States can't be certain it's the real stealth drone, because U.S. personnel don't have access to it. But he added there's no reason to think it's a fake. However, a second senior U.S. military official said that a big question is to how the drone could have remained virtually intact given the high altitude it is believed to have crashed from. The condition of the drone in the video suggests it was not shot down but suffered a system failure, aviation analyst Bill Sweetman said. There are no burn marks from a fire, no holes and no outward damage. Sweetman noticed a dent along the leading edge but doesn't know what that means. ""It's fairly clear here from the pictures that the outer wings have been separated. The question is, did that happen in the accident or (did they take) them off to move the aircraft?"" Sweetman asked. The CIA and the Pentagon would not comment on the video shown Thursday. A senior U.S. official with direct access to the assessment about what happened to the unmanned aircraft said it was tasked to fly over western Afghanistan and look for insurgent activity, with no directive either to fly into Iran or spy on Iran from Afghan airspace. A U.S. satellite quickly pinpointed the downed drone, which apparently sustained significant damage, the senior official said. Iran's U.N. ambassador said in a letter Thursday that the drone flew 250 kilometers (150 miles) into Iranian territory ""to the northern region of the city of Tabas."" The letter from Ambasador Mohammad Khazaee to U.N. Secretary-Genera Ban Ki-moon and the heads of the General Assembly and Security Council said the drone ""faced prompt and forceful action"" by the armed forces. ""My government emphasizes that this blatant and unprovoked air violation by the United States government is tantamount to an act of hostility against the Islamic Republic of Iran in clear contravention of international law, in particular, the basic tenets of the United Nations Charter,"" Khazaee's letter said. He called for U.N. condemnation of U.S. ""acts of aggression,"" as well as ""clear and effective measures to be taken to put an end to these dangerous and unlawful acts in line with the United Nations' responsibilities to maintain international and regional peace and security.""","General: ""No one sends back the spying equipment and its information back""

"ROME, Italy (CNN) -- The Vatican said Tuesday it has worked out a way for groups of Anglicans who are dissatisfied with their faith to join the Catholic Church. The Vatican says more Anglicans have expressed an interest in joining the Catholic Church. The process will enable groups of Anglicans to become Catholic and recognize the pope as their leader, yet have parishes that retain Anglican rites, Vatican officials said. The move comes some 450 years after King Henry VIII broke from Rome and created the Church of England, forerunner of the Anglican Communion. The parishes would be led by former Anglican clergy -- including those who are married -- who would be ordained as Catholic priests, said the Rev. James Massa, ecumenical director of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. ""This sets up a process for whole groups of Anglicans -- clergy and laity -- to enter in to the Catholic Church while retaining their forms of worship and other Anglican traditions,"" Massa said. The number of Anglicans wishing to join the Catholic Church has increased in recent years as the Anglican Church has welcomed the ordination of women and openly gay clergy and blessed homosexual partnerships, said Cardinal William Joseph Levada, the head of the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. Their talks with the Vatican recently began speeding up, Vatican officials said, leading to Tuesday's announcement. ""The Catholic Church is responding to the many requests that have been submitted to the Holy See from groups of Anglican clergy and faithful in different parts of the world who wish to enter into full visible communion,"" Levada said. Levada said ""hundreds"" of Anglicans around the world have expressed their desire to join the Catholic Church. Among them are 50 Anglican bishops, said Archbishop Joseph Augustine Di Noia of the Congregation for Divine Worship. While married Anglican priests may be ordained as Catholic priests, the same does not apply to married Anglican bishops, Levada said. ""We've been praying for this unity for 40 years and we've not anticipated it happening now,"" Di Noia said. ""The Holy Spirit is at work here."" One interested group is the Traditional Anglican Communion, an association of churches that is separate from the Anglican Communion and has hundreds of thousands of members worldwide. The TAC in 2007 petitioned the Vatican for unity with the Catholic Church with the stipulation that the group retain its Anglican rites. The TAC's primate, Archbishop John Hepworth of Australia, said in a statement Tuesday that the Vatican's announcement ""more than matches the dreams we dared to include in our petition two years ago."" That is because the Vatican's move involves not only the TAC but other Anglican groups that want to unite with the Catholic Church, said the Right Rev. Daren K. Williams, bishop ordinary of the western diocese of the Anglican Church of America, which is part of the TAC. The Vatican has yet to release all details of the offer, and the TAC's leaders will meet and discuss how to respond when it does, Williams said. But Williams said he believes much of TAC will respond favorably. Williams, who also is rector of All Saints Anglican Church in Fountain Valley, California, said his parishioners have generally been ""very warmly receiving"" Tuesday's announcement. ""It is encouraging for them to know their worship experience wouldn't be turned upside down by the Roman Catholic Church,"" Williams said. ""The person in the pew should see very little difference in the way we pray. We might be asked to pray aloud for any pope who happens to be in office, in addition to praying for our primate. ""Really, there'd be very little other difference."" The parishes retaining the Anglican rites would answer not to Catholic bishops but to regional or nationwide ""personal ordinariates"" who would report to the pope, Massa said. Those officials often will be former Anglican clergy, Vatican officials said. The Church of England said the move ends a ""period of uncertainty"" for Anglican groups who wanted more unity with the Catholic Church. Both groups have a ""substantial overlap in faith, doctrine and spirituality"" and will continue to hold official dialogues, the archbishops of Canterbury and Westminster said in a joint statement. ""Those Anglicans who have approached the Holy See have made clear their desire for full, visible unity in the one, holy, catholic and apostolic church,"" Levada said. ""At the same time, they have told us of the importance of their Anglican traditions of spirituality and worship for their faith journey."" Preserving Anglican traditions, such as mass rites, adds to the diversity of the Catholic Church, he said. ""The unity of the church does not require a uniformity that ignores cultural diversity, as the history of Christianity shows,"" he said. ""Moreover, the many diverse traditions present in the Catholic Church today are all rooted in the principle articulated by St. Paul in his letter to the Ephesians: 'There is one Lord, one faith, one baptism.' "" CNN's Hada Messia and Jason Hanna contributed to this report.","Vatican opens door to disillusioned Anglicans wanting to join Catholic Church .

"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced Tuesday that it approved the availability of the Plan B One-Step emergency contraception pill without a prescription for women 15 and older. This move comes just weeks after a federal judge in Brooklyn, New York, ordered the FDA to make the morning-after birth control pill available to women of any age, without a prescription. Tuesday's FDA announcement, which pertains to an application from Teva Women's Health, Inc., is not related to that, the FDA said. ""The FDA's approval of Teva's current application for Plan B One-Step is independent of that litigation and this decision is not intended to address the judge's ruling,"" the FDA said in a statement. In early April, the U.S. Justice Department indicated an appeal of the Brooklyn judge's order was under consideration. ""The Department of Justice is reviewing the appellate options and expects to act promptly,"" department spokeswoman Allison Price said. According to the new FDA decision, Plan B One-Step will now be labeled to reflect that proof of age is required to purchase it, and it cannot be sold where age cannot be verified. The packaging will include a product code that prompts the cashier to ask and verify the age of the customer. The product will be available in retail outlets with pharmacies, but the pill can be sold during non-pharmacy hours, too. ""While we fully support this expansion of access to birth control, we continue to believe that the administration should lift all unnecessary restrictions to emergency contraception, consistent with the prevailing science and medicine,"" Planned Parenthood Federation of America President Cecile Richards said Tuesday in a statement. The FDA decision does not pertain to the two other emergency contraceptive drugs marketed in the United States. Plan B is available from generic manufacturers over-the-counter for women 17 and older and Ella is available by prescription only, for all ages, and prevents pregnancy within five days of unprotected sex or contraceptive failure. ""Research has shown that access to emergency contraceptive products has the potential to further decrease the rate of unintended pregnancies in the United States,"" said FDA Commissioner Dr. Margaret A. Hamburg in a statement. ""The data reviewed by the agency demonstrated that women 15 years of age and older were able to understand how Plan B One-Step works, how to use it properly, and that it does not prevent the transmission of a sexually transmitted disease."" None of these products protect against sexually transmitted diseases. Controversy surrounding emergency contraception in the United States has lasted more than just one morning. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommended last year that oral contraceptives be sold over the counter in an effort to reduce the number of unintended pregnancies in the United States. Opponents of prescription requirements say prescriptions can delay access to the drug. In 2011, Teva Women's Health Inc., maker of Plan B One-Step, had asked the FDA to make the drug available without prescription to all sexually active girls and women. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius overruled the FDA's recommendation in 2011, saying, ""I do not believe enough data were presented to support the application."" She mandated requiring a prescription for girls under 17. In early April, U.S. District Court Judge Edward Korman said in his order, ""The decisions of the Secretary with respect to Plan B One-Step and that of the FDA with respect to the Citizen Petition, which it had no choice but to deny, were arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable."" Korman's order sparked praise among supporters of the morning-after pill for all ages, such as the Center for Reproductive Rights, which had launched a relevant lawsuit. Nancy Northup, the center's president and CEO, said in a statement about that order: ""This landmark court decision has struck a huge blow to the deep-seated discrimination that has for too long denied women access to a full range of safe and effective birth control methods."" But other groups, including the Family Research Council, expressed concerns about Korman's order. ""There is a real danger that Plan B may be given to young girls, under coercion or without their consent. The involvement of parents and medical professionals act as a safeguard for these young girls.  However, today's ruling removes these common-sense protections,"" Anna Higgins, director of the organization's Center for Human Dignity, said in a statement. The FDA approved Plan B in 1999. The key ingredient in Plan B is a synthetic hormone called levonorgestrel. This drug stops an egg from being released from the ovary, or preventing fertilization of the egg by sperm. If there has been fertilization, Plan B may prevent a fertilized egg from embedding in the uterus. But if the egg has already been implanted in the uterus, the morning-after pill will not work. Emergency contraceptives are intended for use within 72 hours after sex but are most effective if taken within 24 hours. Many developed countries require a prescription for oral contraceptives, including Canada and most of Europe, but other countries sell the pill without a prescription even formally or informally. A 2012 study in the journal Pediatrics found that there is misinformation about emergency contraception, including about what age women can obtain it without a prescription, and who can take it in general. The morning-after pill goes for about $50, said Susannah Baruch, interim president and CEO of Reproductive Health Technologies Project.","NEW: FDA: Morning-after pill can be sold over-the-counter to women 15 and older .
New decision is not related to litigation surrounding Brooklyn judge's order .
Previously, the morning-after pill required a prescription for women 17 and older ."
"Open, expansive postures reflect and signal power (picture Wonder Woman). They are expressed by individuals who already feel powerful. Powerless people do the opposite -- contracting, hunching, and making themselves smaller. When it comes to power, the mind shapes the body, a finding supported by extensive peer-reviewed science. This, to most of us, is not so surprising. But what is surprising, when it comes to power, is that the body also shapes the mind. Dana Carney (UC-Berkeley) and I, both experimental social psychologists, have conducted research showing that adopting these postures -- ""power posing"" -- actually causes people to become more powerful: After sitting or standing, alone in a room, in a high-power pose for just two minutes, participants in our experiments resembled powerful people -- emotionally, cognitively, behaviorally, and even physiologically. They felt more powerful, were more willing to take risks, presented their ideas with greater confidence and enthusiasm, performed better in demanding situations, and experienced significant increases in testosterone -- a hormone linked to assertiveness -- and significant decreases in cortisol -- a hormone linked to stress. In other words -- two minutes of preparatory power posing optimizes the brain to function well in high-stakes challenges. Watch Amy Cuddy's TED Talk . When I launched this program of research, I was not motivated to turn Gordon Gekkos into Gordon Gekkos-on-steroids. But I can understand how, noticing that I'm a professor at a competitive business school and that I use terms like ""power"" and ""posing,"" some people might have assumed that I was. In all honesty, my goal -- inspired in part by observing students who were struggling to engage in class discussions and in part by the feelings of powerlessness I'd experienced earlier in my own life (i.e., yes, it was part ""mesearch"") -- was to discover scientifically grounded ways to help relatively powerless people harness some of the healthy psychological benefits that relatively powerful people often enjoy. I aspired to embolden the people suffering from what psychologists call ""imposter syndrome"" -- the experience of hearing that relentless, looping voice in your head that says, ""I don't deserve to be here, I don't deserve to be here"" -- which can be thoroughly disempowering. TED.com: Listening to shame . I wanted to equip people with tools that would help them feel stronger and more confident, less stressed and fearful, and better able to bring their full, spirited selves to high-stakes, stressful situations -- like job interviews or speaking in class. Preparatory power posing is taking a few minutes before walking into a stressful interaction or situation to open up, occupy more space, and make yourself big. Stand with your feet apart and your hands on your hips, or with your arms reaching up in a 'V.' Or sit with your legs in front of you, feet propped up on desk or a table, leaning back, with your hands on the back of your head, fingers interlaced, and elbows pointing out. Try power poses in the elevator, a bathroom stall, the stairwell...wherever you can find two minutes of privacy. Who benefits from this, and how can those people use it in constructive ways? In the month since my TEDTalk was posted, I've received messages from thousands of people around the world describing to me how they've successfully used power posing to confront or overcome a challenge. I must admit, I never could have imagined the diverse range of contexts in which people are using it. I wish I had the space to tell you about all of them. Let me at least offer a sample: people recovering from grave illnesses, injuries, and losses, unemployed people who have been job-hunting for months or years, young women struggling to get a foothold or to succeed in traditionally male-dominated professions, people trying to survive or leave abusive relationships,  singers/actors/dancers preparing for auditions or performances, older adults and nontraditional students working up the courage to return to or to fully engage in their education, dedicated athletes training for highly competitive events, and teachers and parents of bullied children who -- every day -- have to confront their bullies. In short, I have heard from women and men, girls and boys, of all ages and races, and from nearly every corner of the world, who have encountered some kind of adversity, have been nagged by that voice telling them they don't belong, and who have been searching for ways to successfully tackle their specific challenges and to prosper. TED.com: Embracing otherness . As a researcher, I'm moved beyond words by these strangers' willingness to share such personal stories of vulnerability, and I'm humbled and astounded to see how this research has resonated with people outside my science. One person wrote, ""I learned that making progress in life is not a continuous function but rather a bunch of leaps of faith one needs to take in oneself. You need to do what you think is impossible and realize that people who already are doing that, are just like you."" Another wrote, ""I'm a first generation student and senior at [a large, top-tier university], but I still feel I don't belong here. I was about to withdraw from school this week. Your story inspired me to stay. You'll never know how glad I am I found this video."" And this: ""I am a shy person, and I had a job interview this morning. I got there early and I went to the washroom and raised my arms for 2 minutes. It was like magic how confident and outgoing I became during the interview. I got the job."" What more could a social scientist ever hope for? In short, the populations of people who can benefit from power posing extend far beyond business leaders and politicians. TED.com: How to spot a liar . The word ""power"" triggers a negative visceral twitch in many people. It's a word that carries more than its fair share of baggage. But the kind of power I study -- intrapersonal power -- should not cause people to recoil, because it is neither zero-sum nor is it about interpersonal dominance. As Pulitzer Prize-winning author Robert Caro once wrote, ""Power doesn't always corrupt. Power can cleanse. What I believe is always true about power is that power always reveals."" Power, ultimately, is not about faking or disguising; it's about revealing and bringing forth -- stripping away the fears and inhibitions that prevent people from being their truest, most energetic, vital selves. And, when people feel like their fullest selves -- they create, they connect, and they communicate. Why would we not want a world full of people who feel that way? So I ask you to do two things. First, try this: Before you walk into a stressful situation or confront a difficult challenge, take two minutes to prepare by power posing in private. Second, please, share this science with people who truly and chronically lack resources, status, and formal power; this is a free, no-tech life hack that has the ""power"" to significantly change meaningful outcomes in their lives.","Amy Cuddy: People who use expansive postures feel more powerful as a result .
She says posing with your arms extended, taking up more space, affects your physiology .
Many who have tried ""power poses"" say it has helped them navigate life, she says ."
"Horses have been pulling passenger carriages on New York City streets since 1858, 50 years before the Ford Model T was introduced, and there's no arguing they've been an iconic feature of the city's culture. But as society evolves, so do its standards. When traditions become unacceptable, we don't stick to them simply to keep money coming in. We make new ones. There is no better example of an obsolete and unacceptable tradition than New York City's horse-drawn carriage rides. In the 21st century, using horses to pull heavy loads of tourists through congested city streets is unnatural, unnecessary and an undeniable strain on the horses. And that strain is not restricted to the streets. The stables to which these horses return -- former tenement buildings -- do not afford horses a paddock for turnout, the ability to graze or the freedom to roll and run. That's why, as an organization that's fought for humane treatment of horses since our founding in 1866, we think it's time to end horse-drawn carriage rides, a position firmly and bravely backed by New York City's new mayor, Bill de Blasio. ""We're going to get rid of horse carriages, period,"" the mayor said two days before taking office. No counterargument stands up to the sheer absurdity of this antiquated practice, though many who profit from it keep trying. Opposite view: Keep the beloved New York carriage rides . A carriage driver and industry spokesperson recently told CNN that only ""two different sides"" are arguing this issue: ""the people that know about horses, and people who just look at the horses and give their first impression based on something they read on the Internet."" That statement indicates a deliberate ignorance that serves neither the horses nor the truth. There are many perspectives on this issue, but because these carriages are profit-driven as well as horse-driven, the paramount question is ""What's in the best interest of the horses?"" And is the answer more likely to come from a group dedicated to animal rescue and protection or from horse carriage drivers teaming up with a St. Louis-based PR firm that says it is fighting ""radical animal rights extremists"" to protect industry? Are the concerns about lost jobs legitimate? Absolutely. We share those concerns and encourage new ideas to address them. But using fear over facts and paper-thin arguments to sway this debate is irresponsible. Here's a sampling of the most ridiculous points suggested by the carriage horse industry and others in the media: . Carriage horses have ample ""vacation time."" This may come as news to some, but horses don't understand the idea of workplace benefits. Time off is no defense if the time on is degrading. And another key difference: If you don't like your job, you can quit. These horses' nine-hour shifts, pulling vehicles weighing hundreds of pounds through bumper-to-bumper traffic on hard pavement, go on without regard to their natural inclinations or overall well-being. The presence of police horses means the use of carriage horses is appropriate. Police horses serve a public service. Carriage horses exist for personal profit. That's the difference between necessary and unnecessary. Yes, they're both horses -- just like police officers and ticket scalpers are both humans -- but their roles could not be more different. It should also be noted that New York Police Department Mounted Unit horses and officers undergo months of specialized training, while New York City carriage horse drivers must simply attend a two-day course and have a valid driver's license. Horses share our environment: If it's good enough for us, it's good enough for them. Humans can get off the street, go inside, sit down and generally leave pollutants, noise, potholes and traffic behind. Horses don't have that luxury. Not only that, but the official training manual for horse-drawn carriage operators cautions drivers that horses are naturally alarmed by -- among other things -- brightly colored traffic lines, manhole covers, potholes, motorcycles, ambulance and police sirens, barking dogs, and noisy crowds. Sound like any city you know? The number of carriage horse violations and accidents is insignificant. The ASPCA has issued more than 230 summonses to carriage operators since 2007. But just one dangerous incident or violation is one too many. In one of many stories of these animals panicking, a  mare named Smoothie was spooked and bolted onto the sidewalk where she died of shock in 2007. In December, a carriage horse operator was arrested and charged with animal cruelty for working a horse that was visibly injured. Incidents such as these shouldn't be tolerated, especially when the practice is so unnecessary. And New York City still needs carriage horses like it still needs subway tokens. If the practice ends, the horses will be destroyed or abandoned. We hear this false forecast all too often. Many rescue organizations and shelters are ready and willing to find and open homes to these horses, if their owners allow it. The ASPCA will gladly get involved to help find and facilitate humane options for any horse in need of placement. But by no means does life as a carriage horse ensure the animal won't eventually be killed for profit. When their useful days are done, they may well be sent to auctions where buyers are often looking for American horses to ship to Canada or Mexico for slaughter and human consumption overseas. This debate is a conversation New York City needs to have. But it should happen in a context of hard truth, not hyperbolic bias. New Yorkers deserve that. And so do the animals with whom they share the city. We applaud efforts clearly in motion to take these horses off city streets, pushing both them and New York itself into a more civilized future that should be welcomed, not feared.","Matt Bershadker: When traditions are unacceptable, we should change them .

"(CNN) -- With a slew of domestic violence cases permeating the NFL, some football fans are benching America's favorite fall pastime. Even after the league enacted tougher punishments for domestic violence and three accused players sat out during games Sunday, the Twitter hashtag #BoycottNFL and calls for Commissioner Roger Goodell's removal are running rampant. ""No football for me today. Fire Goodell and I may return. #BoycottNFL @nflcommish @nfl #FireGoodell,"" Scott Allen tweeted. And the women's rights group Ultraviolet flew a banner over the New York Giants-Arizona Cardinals game Sunday, saying Goodell must go. Our #GoodellMustGo banner flying above @MLStadium today before the @Giants game. http://t.co/4bnpFXz2TS pic.twitter.com/KZ8macy9iW . According to a USA Today database, at least 84 NFL players have been arrested and accused of domestic violence since 2000. But the recent cases of four players -- Ray Rice, Greg Hardy, Adrian Peterson and Ray McDonald -- have hurled the topic into the spotlight. Newsom: Sideline McDonald . California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom is publicly asking the San Francisco 49ers to bench McDonald pending the outcome of his felony domestic violence investigation. ""(T)he 49ers' continued insistence on playing Ray McDonald during his ongoing criminal investigation is a painful affront to every victim of domestic violence and sends a troubling message to our community and especially our children that 'zero tolerance' are empty words, not real actions,"" Newsom and his wife said in a message on Facebook. McDonald was arrested on August 31 on suspicion of felony domestic violence after he allegedly got involved in an altercation with his fiancee, who was 10 weeks pregnant, a police source told The Sacramento Bee. The fiancee showed police minor bruises on her neck and arms, the newspaper said. After McDonald posted bail, he said he couldn't say much about the case. ""The truth will come out,"" he told CNN affiliate KTVU. ""Everybody knows what kind of person I am ... a good-hearted person."" Last week, San Francisco 49ers CEO Jed York said the team was awaiting the outcome of the criminal case against McDonald before determining whether to punish him. ""I think it's very important that we do let due process take its course,"" York told KNBR-AM. Rice could appeal . Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice, who was videotaped in February punching his then-fiancee in an elevator and dragging her unconscious body out, could appeal his indefinite suspension from the NFL. ESPN and Pro Football Talk said Rice will appeal Monday. But the NFL Players Association said Sunday that it could not confirm whether an appeal decision has been made. ""We don't know yet if or when our filing will come,"" said George Atallah, assistant executive director of NFLPA external affairs. Rice's attorney has not responded to CNN's request for comment. Ray Rice case: Did NFL execs know the truth earlier? The NFL's actions . After public outcry over a two-game suspension for Rice, the NFL established a six-game unpaid ban for personnel who violate the league's policy on domestic violence, Goodell said Thursday. A second incident would be punished by a lifetime ban from the league, Goodell said in a letter to the owners of the league's 32 teams. Other players have been disciplined over the past week. Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson was deactivated after he was indicted by a grand jury last week on a child abuse charge. He allegedly whipped his 4-year-old son repeatedly with a ""switch."" But his attorney said Peterson is ""a loving father"" who was disciplining his son. ""He used the same kind of discipline with his child that he experienced as a child growing up in east Texas,"" attorney Rusty Hardin said. And on Sunday, the Carolina Panthers announced just before game time that defensive end Greg Hardy would not be playing against the Detroit Lions. In May, authorities say, Hardy choked his then-girlfriend, dragged her by her hair and threatened to kill her. He was sentenced in July to 18 months of probation and a 60-day suspended sentence for the misdemeanors he was charged with. Hardy said he is innocent and has appealed a guilty verdict. In his post-game remarks Sunday, Panthers coach Ron Rivera alluded to the controversy looming over not just Hardy, but over the entire league. ""The climate has changed,"" he said. ""We really do have to get this right. Believe me. I understand that."" Tough questions . ESPN anchor and ""life-long fan"" Hannah Storm deplored the abuse cases in an emotional sign-off on Sunday. ""On Monday morning, I was genuinely excited to come to work and break down what I thought was a fascinating first weekend in the NFL,"" Storm told viewers. ""Instead, I kicked off ESPN's coverage of the horrific Ray Rice elevator video."" She described trying to answer her daughters' difficult questions over the weekend -- ""Mom, why did he do that? Why is he in jail? Why didn't he get fired?"" Storm said she has some lingering questions of her own. ""What does all of this mean for the future? What does it mean for female fans whose dollars are so coveted by the NFL (and) who make up an estimated 45% of the NFL's fan base?"" ""What exactly does the NFL stand for?"" CNN's Steve Almasy, Rachel Nichols, Michael Martinez, Priscilla Riojas, Mayra Cuevas and Kevin Conlon and CNN Sports' Kevin Dotson contributed to this report.","A women's rights group calls for the NFL commissioner's resignation at a Giants game .

"In Baghdad on Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry vowed that the U.S. and a ""broad coalition"" of nations would help Iraq fight ISIS militants. His visit comes hours before President Barack Obama will address Americans about his strategy for combating the terror group. Baghdad is Kerry's first stop on a regional tour to enlist Arab support for a global coalition to defeat ISIS. After meeting privately, Iraq's new Prime Minister, Haider al-Abadi, and Kerry spoke before reporters. ""We are fighting these people (ISIS),"" al-Abadi said. ""Of course, our role is to defend our country, but the international community is responsible to protect Iraq and protect Iraqis in the whole region. ""What's happening in Syria is coming across to Iraq,"" he said. ""We cannot cross that border. It is an international border, but there is a role for the international community for the United Nations to do that ... and of course for the United States to act immediately to stop the spread of this cancer."" He said Iraqis have worked hard recently to come together and form an inclusive government where ""everybody's on board"" to fight the militants. ISIS has said they're bent on creating an Islamic caliphate in Iraq and Syria where harsh Sharia law governs every aspect of life. Kerry first congratulated al-Abadi on working in record time to form a solid government. ""Your comments today and your description to me in our private meeting of the steps you're prepared to take, not only with respect to (ISIS) and your own military commitment to reconstitute itself and to take the fight to (ISIS) ... this is really important from the international community"" perspective, Kerry said. He said Obama will lay out a detailed description of what the United States is prepared to do, in a ""broad coalition"" with ""many other countries to take on this terrorist structure which is unacceptable by any standard anywhere in the world."" Obama is open to conducting airstrikes in Syria to combat the ISIS terror group, U.S. officials told CNN on Wednesday. But it's unclear whether he will announce any such plan in his televised speech Wednesday night. Read the latest news about Obama and Syria . In a separate news conference Wednesday in Iraq, Kerry said the U.S. is already coordinating with some 40 other nations to provide humanitarian, military and other assistance to Iraqis to fight ISIS militants. The U.S. has so far launched more than 150 airstrikes to weaken ISIS militants in Iraq, Kerry said. On Wednesday, a U.S. military attack aircraft conducted a strike in support of Iraqi Security Forces' defense of Irbil. The strike destroyed one ISIS armed vehicle in the vicinity of Irbil, the military said, and the aircraft left the strike area safely. 'The hard work is far from over' Kerry said that while he finds it ""encouraging"" that Iraqis are coming together so quickly to form a government, ""it doesn't mean much if it isn't able to govern inclusively."" Critics of former Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki accused him of consolidating power and persecuting political rivals, blaming him for fueling Iraq's problems with sectarian policies that alienated Sunni Muslims. ""The hard work is far from over,"" Kerry noted. ""In many ways, it's just beginning."" Iraq must strengthen its security forces, he said. In the face of ISIS attacks, some Iraqi soldiers simply ran from their posts. On the security front, Kerry said that Iraqi leaders have decided to establish locally rooted security structures that will be integrated into Iraq's national force. Doing so would be ""key"" to ""guaranteeing Iraq's territorial integrity,"" he said. Al-Abadi plans to accelerate the formation of those local units at his first Cabinet meeting this week, Kerry said. Kerry said that Obama asked him to visit Iraq not just to build a coalition and talk with Iraqis, but also to ""underscore to the people of Iraq that the U.S. will stand by them in this effort."" He called ISIS a ""vicious"" organization that is ""the single biggest threat"" to the country. Stressing that the fight against ISIS will be long, Kerry said Monday that the U.S. would assemble a coalition ""built to endure for the months, and perhaps years, to come."" Taking fight against ISIS 'to the next level' Senior State Department officials traveling with Kerry said the appointment of the new government would kick-start a strategy the Obama administration began this summer to combat ISIS, including increasing intelligence gathering in Iraq, assessing the Iraqi military capability and launching strategic airstrikes at ISIS targets, which the officials say have blunted the group's momentum. ""That was really critical to set a baseline foundation in the event additional decisions were made,"" one senior official said. ""We've come a long way since then, based upon this plan that we really put in place in June, and we are now at the stage of beginning to take it to the next level."" Kerry's visit comes ""under circumstances in which there are real opportunities,"" the official said. ""Certainly the road ahead is daunting,"" the official said. ""But to get to this point is significant ... there is a chance now."" Obama called al-Abadi on Monday to congratulate him on the formation of the new government. Baghdad was the first stop on a regional tour to enlist Arab support for a global coalition to defeat ISIS. In a statement, the White House said that in his call with Obama, al-Abadi ""expressed his commitment to work with all communities in Iraq as well as regional and international partners to strengthen Iraq's capabilities"" to fight ISIS militants, made up largely of Sunni jihadists. Broadening the anti-ISIS coalition . As Kerry leaves Iraq, Obama will address Americans about his diplomatic, military and economic campaign to defeat the group, which has captured large swaths of Syria and Iraq and has beheaded two American journalists. Videotaped beheadings, including two murders of American journalists, have led to the push for a broader counterterrorism mission, including possible airstrikes in Syria, where ISIS has a haven. The U.S. has ruled out sending American troops for a ground offensive. Obama has been reluctant to take military action against the group in Syria, which could indirectly help President Bashar al-Assad's regime. But White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the President was willing to go ""wherever is necessary to strike those who are threatening Americans."" After leaving Baghdad, Kerry's diplomatic drive will center on building regional support for a global coalition to combat ISIS. He will meet with King Abdullah II in Jordan on Wednesday before traveling Thursday to Saudi Arabia. In the seaside town of Jeddah, Kerry will meet with the leaders of six Persian Gulf nations. In addition to support for a military campaign against ISIS, administration officials said the United States would be looking to its Gulf allies to crack down on ISIS funding and stop the flow of foreign fighters, both seen as the lifeblood of the jihadist group. The United States also wants Sunni Arab states, particularly Saudi Arabia, to counter ISIS' narrative and persuade other Sunnis to eschew its ideology. ""It's going to be a very difficult, long road to get there, but it's something that the region and our partners in the Gulf can play a really important role in,"" a senior State Department official traveling with Kerry said. ""And there's a number of different ways that they can do that, both in terms of just their relationships, in terms of their encouragement, in terms of their financial contributions, in terms of lifting the burden that the government here has."" After Saudi Arabia, Kerry will travel to Paris to attend an international conference on Iraq, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. Obama will chair a meeting later this month at the U.N. General Assembly, where the global strategy is expected to be hammered out.","Kerry says the U.S. and about 40 other nations are helping fight ISIS in Iraq .

"The U.N. Security Council, capping a dramatic month of diplomacy, voted unanimously late Friday to require Syria to eliminate its arsenal of chemical weapons -- or face consequences. ""Today's resolution will ensure that the elimination of the Syrian chemical weapons program happens as soon as possible and with the utmost transparency and accountability,"" Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said. The U.N. resolution was based on a deal struck this month between the United States and Russia that averted an American military strike over allegations the Syrian government used sarin nerve gas in an August 21 attack on a Damascus suburb that U.S. officials said left at least 1,400 people dead. The resolution did not authorize the automatic use of force if Syria is said to be in violation, as was previously sought by the United States. The 15-member Security Council met shortly after the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, or OPCW, voted to fast-track Syria's addition to the Chemical Weapons Convention, which bans such weapons. For nearly two years, the U.N. Security Council had been unable to reach a consensus over what to do to bring about an end to Syria's civil war. Russia and China repeatedly vetoed resolutions dating back to October 2011 that condemned President Bashar al-Assad's government and called for him to step down. The turnaround came this month, when Russia called for Syria to divest itself of its chemical weapons arsenal after U.S. President Barack Obama accused Syria of crossing a ""red line"" with the use of nerve gas and threatened a strike. Syria announced this month that it was willing to join the agreement. A binding obligation . Both the United States and Russia warned that if Syria failed to adhere to the terms of the U.N. resolution, it would face consequences. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the world community was imposing a binding obligation on the government of al-Assad to get rid of its stockpile. ""This resolution makes clear that those responsible for this heinous act must be held accountable,"" said Kerry. If the resolution succeeds, the world ""will have eliminated one of the largest chemical weapon arsenals on Earth, eliminating it from one of the most volatile places on Earth,"" Kerry said. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told the council that his country, long an ally of the Syrian government, ""will stand ready to take action"" if the resolution needs enforcement. By agreeing to dismantle its chemical weapons program and provide documentation of its arsenal, ""Damascus has shown its readiness to cooperate,"" said Lavrov. Syrian U.N. Ambassador Bashar Jaafari said the resolution holds all parties in Syria accountable for the use of chemical weapons. Inspectors return to Syria . U.N. weapons inspectors returned to Syria this week to look into at least a half-dozen claims of chemical weapons use -- some allegedly by the government, others allegedly by rebels. U.N. inspectors have already confirmed the use of chemical warfare in the rural Damascus suburb of Ateibeh in August, but have not explicitly said who was responsible. The al-Assad government has repeatedly accused rebels of using chemical weapons, an assertion that has been widely dismissed by most Western leaders. The United Nations estimates more than 100,000 people have died since March 2011 when a brutal government crackdown against protesters devolved into an all-out civil war. The Security Council vote followed action by the executive council of the OPCW, meeting in the Netherlands. That group adopted its measure by consensus in about 10 minutes. ""We now have a legal mandate to start a verification mission in Syria,"" OPCW spokesman Michael Luhan. The OPCW agreed to an ""accelerated program for achieving the complete elimination of Syria's chemical weapons by mid-2014,"" it said in a statement. Inspections in Syria will begin Tuesday. ""The decision also calls for ambitious milestones for destruction, which will be set by the council by 15 November,"" the organization said. Obama: 'Very hopeful' Obama, speaking before the votes, said he was ""very hopeful"" about the developments, but warned much work remains to be done. ""I think, rightly, people have been concerned about whether Syria will follow through on the commitments that have been laid forth and I think there are legitimate concerns as to how technically we are going to be getting those chemical weapons out while there's still fighting going on the ground,"" Obama said. Obama said the threat of U.S. military power pushed Syrian leaders to agree to destroy their chemical weapons and said the resolution ""not only deters and prevents additional chemical use but actually goes beyond what could have been accomplished through any military action."" The OPCW plans to send an advance team of inspectors to Damascus, an official with the organization, who declined to be identified while discussing delicate operations, told CNN on Friday. The official said that in order to meet international deadlines for destruction of Syria's chemical weapons, the group may opt for a ""quick and dirty"" program that would render the weapons unusable but wouldn't destroy them, the official said. U.S. official: Syrian CW list more complete than anticipated . 'Not a license to kill' Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu has said his country is willing to transport and destroy Syrian chemical weapons, although only as part of an international coalition. Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier in September took to The New York Times to argue against military intervention in Syria. Striking Syria would have many negative ramifications, Putin argued in the piece, including the killing of innocent people, spreading violence around the Middle East, clouding diplomatic efforts to address Iran's nuclear crisis and resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and ""unleash(ing) a new wave of terrorism."" In his remarks Friday night, Ban called on both the Syrian government and rebels to stop the fighting. ""As we mark this important step, we must never forget that the catalog of horrors in Syria continues with bombs and tanks, grenades and guns,"" he said. ""A red light for one form of weapons does not mean a green light for others.  This is not a license to kill with conventional weapons."" Syria submits 'initial disclosure' of chemical weapons program . 'No meaningful enforcement mechanisms' Two Republican U.S. senators criticized the Security Council vote, saying it will do little to end the civil war. ""This resolution is another triumph of hope over reality,"" John McCain and Lindsey Graham said in a statement. ""It contains no meaningful or immediate enforcement mechanisms, let alone a threat of the use of force for the Assad regime's noncompliance."" The pair said al-Assad's forces will continue to ""use every weapon in their arsenal short of chemical weapons"" on the Syrian people while receiving outside assistance from Russia, Iran and Hezbollah while doing so.","Syria says chemical weapons resolution applies to all parties .

"(CNN) -- I wear the burqa for the simple reason that I am a Muslim and the Koran says that I must wear the full veil in order to be modest. I am proud of my Muslim faith and my modesty. I am proud to follow God's law. Nobody ever forced me to wear the full veil and I have been wearing it for around 10 years now. In fact, very few of my friends actually wear one. There are, of course, situations in which some men force their wives or daughters to wear the burqa but, believe me, these cases are a very, very small minority. For those of us who are believers, we just want to do God's will and live by the sacred text, so what any man says has nothing to do with that. I am testament to that as I don't have a husband and I practice my religion freely, that's why I'm always shocked when people say it's the husband who forces his wife to wear a burqa. It is actually the case that a lot of men in France do not wish their wives to wear the full veil because when they go out, they are insulted or attacked and their husbands don't want them to be put in that situation. I first started wearing the full veil when I was a teenager but I stopped for a while because when you're young, you don't want to be set apart, you want to look like everyone else. But later after seeing what was happening with terrorist attacks involving Muslims all over the world, I decided to become more conscious and find out more about my faith. In the process, I found myself becoming more spiritual and decided to start wearing the burqa. Now, my liberty is being threatened with this law proposed by the French government. If this law is passed, it will be a great injustice. It is very unfair that they are even considering this law. Perhaps the French authorities are terrified that women will start dressing like this, despite evidence to the contrary. Why am I, as a Muslim woman, targeted unfairly, when there are less than 2,000 of us in France who wear the burqa? Where is my freedom of clothing or expression? France prides itself as a country that upholds the rights of man but where are my rights? Why am I not free to wear what I want? Many cite security reasons because they can't tell who is under the veil. But myself and a lot of women who wear the burqa are always happy to identify ourselves when asked. In the past, I have taken off my veil when it is asked of me -- as long as it's a woman who does it. My religion demands that I cover my face in front of any man who is not either my brother, father or husband. I have been wearing the veil in France for years and it has never been a problem, I use public transport like everyone else and I've never had any problems. Although, it can be quite strange when I'm on a bus for example and people say to me: 'You poor thing, we feel sorry for you.' And I wonder exactly why they feel sorry for me. I'm very happy wearing the veil and it makes me spiritually fulfilled as I'm practicing my religion, so I don't really see it as anything to pity me for. I really believe that France is scared of Muslims, which is the motivation for this law, but people shouldn't generalize as not all Muslims are the same. Yes, some have done terrible things, but it is done in the name of man, never in the name of God. I, as a French Muslim woman, have nothing but love in my heart towards all people. And whatever the outcome, if France succeeds in banning the veil on its streets, I will never take mine off. My freedom means a lot to me and if this law is passed, I would rather move to another country where I can worship in peace. I obey the laws of God not the laws of man. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Oumkheyr.","French Muslim Oumkheyr speaks to CNN about why she chooses to wear the burqa .

"Ben Affleck has more than just a couple of Golden Globes to add to his resume. His movie ""Argo,"" about the suspenseful rescue of U.S. diplomats during the Iran hostage crisis, has also achieved the unusual honor of prompting Tehran to produce its own cinematic response. Opinion: Latino should have played lead in 'Argo' ""Argo"" was named best drama movie during the Golden Globes ceremony on Sunday night in Los Angeles, and Affleck won the award for best director, a category for which he was passed over in the recent Oscar nominations. But his efforts to recreate on screen the drama of the secret operation by the CIA and Canada to extract six U.S. embassy workers from revolutionary Iran in 1980 haven't been overlooked by Tehran's Art Bureau. 'Argo' recognizes forgotten heroes of Iran hostage saga . It plans to fund a movie entitled ""The General Staff,"" about 20 American hostages who were handed over to the United States by Iranian revolutionaries, according to a report last week by Mehr News, the official Iranian agency. ""This film, which will be a big production, should be an appropriate response to the ahistoric film 'Argo,'"" said Ataollah Salmanian, the director of the Iranian film, according to Mehr. ""Argo"" claims to be based on a true story rather than to constitute a scrupulous retelling of exactly what took place, and its deviations from reality have been documented. But Iranian authorities have taken offense at the film's portrayal of the country and its people. ""Argo"" was officially viewed as ""anti-Iranian"" following its U.S. release last year, Mehr reported. Iran's state-run broadcaster Press TV detailed its objections to the film in an online article on Sunday. ""The Iranophobic American movie attempts to describe Iranians as overemotional, irrational, insane, and diabolical while at the same, the CIA agents are represented as heroically patriotic,"" it complained. In the movie, in which Affleck plays the lead role, the CIA operation is shown outwitting Iranian authorities through an elaborate plan based on pretending that the U.S. diplomats fleeing the country were part of team scouting locations for an outlandish science-fiction film. But according to Press TV, the film is ""a far cry from a balanced narration"" and is ""replete with historical inaccuracies and distortions."" On the other hand, ""The General Staff,"" set to begin shooting next year, will be based on eyewitness accounts, Salmanian said. The Art Bureau, which is to provide the financing, is affiliated with the Islamic Ideology Dissemination Organization, according to Mehr. Press TV cited Salmanian as saying that his film would depict ""the historical event unlike the American version which lacks a proper view of the story.""","Ben Affleck's ""Argo"" tells the story of a dramatic rescue of U.S. diplomats from revolutionary Iran .

"Ajdabiya, Libya (CNN) -- The retreat of Moammar Gadhafi's forces from a key eastern city Saturday reinvigorated the opposition, which began taking the fight west toward the capital of Tripoli. By Saturday evening, advancing opposition fighters had reached the outskirts of the city of Brega, to the west of Ajdabiya, said opposition spokesman Col. Ahmed Omar Bani. ""The winds of change are starting to blow,"" Bani told reporters in Benghazi. Gadhafi's troops fell back after days of fierce fighting in Ajdabiya, Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim told reporters. He said the coalition's airstrike attacks were direct and the Libyan military decided to withdraw. That air campaign continued Saturday, further limiting loyalist movements. French warplanes destroyed at least five Libyan combat planes and two helicopters over a 24-hour period, the Ministry of Defense said. Meanwhile, an especially loud explosion and the subsequent sound of a plane, most likely belonging to the allies, were heard late Saturday in Tripoli, but there was no anti-aircraft fire in response. After the fall of Ajdabiya, the fighting is sure to shift westward through cities and towns that are more loyal to Gadhafi. Jalal al-Gallal, another spokesman, said the opposition expects heavy resistance in towns like Sirte, Gadhafi's birthplace, where he has strong support. Gadhafi's forces resumed shelling Misrata, just two hours east of Tripoli, where some of the most intense fighting has taken place since protests erupted in Libya last month. A witness told CNN that Gadhafi troops randomly targeted buildings and people in Misrata. Another witness said he saw busloads of loyalist snipers being brought to the city. CNN could not independently verify those accounts. Officials have said Gadhafi is far from defeated and still retains the power to reinforce units. Opposition fighters chanted gratitude for the coalition's support after they wrested control of Ajdabiya, considered a gateway to Libya's vast oil fields and a stopping point en route to the rebel stronghold of Benghazi. They were confident that with protective air power they would be able to hold onto the city they had captured once before but lost to Gadhafi's army. Ajdabiya is now ""100 percent"" in opposition hands, said Shamsuldin Abed Mawlah, spokesman for Libya's opposition interim council. He said many loyalists were retreating westward. Overnight, international fighter jets again bombed Libyan tanks that have been entrenched at the city's northern and western gates for days, said al-Gallal. At the northern entrance, damaged tanks lay strewn across the rolling desert. The buildings around the city entrances were riddled with bullet holes. Rebel troops combed the city's streets Saturday, hunting for any remaining Gadhafi loyalists as some displaced residents trickled back to their homes. The Ajdabiya victory is viewed as significant for the opposition. It also served as evidence of the impact of coalition airstrikes as NATO prepares to take command of the Libya mission this weekend. Coalition airstrikes targeted Gadhafi's military on the outskirts of Misrata but tanks resumed shelling Saturday, a doctor at the main hospital told CNN. Opposition fighters, armed only with light weapons, were trying to repel the attack and casualties were mounting, he said. At least 20 people were wounded in Misrata, victims of snipers taking aim in the heart of the city, said the doctor, who was not identified for safety reasons. Friday, seven people were killed and another 70 were wounded. Al-Gallal said the next big battle will be for control of Misrata. ""He (Gadhafi) is scared about Misrata,"" al-Gallal said. ""It's too close to Tripoli. He's going to do everything he can to hold on to it."" Opposition leaders uploaded a video that showed a rooftop view of Misrata. Gunfire could be heard and puffs of smoke rose from at least one rooftop, possibly indicating a sniper. CNN could not verify the contents of the video. Coalition planes flew 164 sorties Friday in Operation Odyssey Dawn and coalition leaders reported damage to Gadhafi's ground forces. ""Coalition forces have targeted anti-air capabilities, tanks, armored vehicles, as well as other regime forces threatening the civilians throughout the country,"" said Capt. Clint Gebke, a coalition spokesman. U.S. President Barack Obama defended America's leadership in the international coalition in his weekly radio address Saturday. ""Make no mistake,"" Obama said, ""because we acted quickly, a humanitarian catastrophe has been avoided and the lives of countless civilians -- innocent men, women and children -- have been saved."" ""The United States should not -- and cannot -- intervene every time there's a crisis somewhere in the world,"" Obama said. ""But I firmly believe that when innocent people are being brutalized; when someone like Gadhafi threatens a bloodbath that could destabilize an entire region; and when the international community is prepared to come together to save many thousands of lives -- then it's in our national interest to act. And it's our responsibility. This is one of those times."" Obama is scheduled to deliver a televised address on Libya Monday evening. Libyan government spokesman Ibrahim Mussa slammed the coalition attacks. ""This is immoral, illegal and it was not authorized by the (United Nations) Security Council,"" he told reporters in Tripoli. Libyan state television reported Saturday that ""airstrikes from the enemy"" had hit military positions in Tarhunah, about 40 miles (66 kilometers) from the country's capital. Pentagon spokesman Capt. Darryn James told CNN Saturday that airstrikes had struck military targets along the Libyan coast, including those in the capital.

"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- The world was watching in 2006 when the Microsoft-designed School of the Future opened in Philadelphia and attempted to reform education. Despite having four principals, curriculum overhauls, and student technology gaps, the school graduated its first senior class last week, with every graduate having plans for institutions of higher learning. ""This isn't a school about technology, this is a school about redefining the norm for urban education,"" said Mary Cullinane, director of innovation for Microsoft Education, who is also the liaison to the school. ""We've had this saying from the very beginning: Money and technology are great, but people are better."" And everything about the state-of-the-art facility, complete with digital whiteboards and streaming video in classrooms, was created to be different from the beginning, too. The majority-minority $63 million school was erected with school district funds in the tough Parkside neighborhood in West Philadelphia. The school partnered with Microsoft on new approaches to curriculum, teaching methods and staffing. The school is made up of students chosen by a lottery of public school students, with the majority of them coming from low-income households with limited access to technology and training. The school struggled in its infancy. Its first standardized test scores last year were daunting. Less than 8 percent of 11th-graders scored proficient or higher in math, while just over 23 percent scored proficient or higher in reading. It's back to basics under the watch of Rosalind Chivis, principal for the last two school years. Regardless of the advancements, Chivis says success is in the approach. ""I don't care how good the technology is, I don't care how good the books are, the ancillary materials, if you cannot create a stellar climate conducive to good teaching and learning, it's not going to happen,"" Chivis said. ""It's about connections, it's about relationships, it's about caring."" Test scores don't tell the whole story of School of the Future, according to Cullinane. ""We wanted to take on all the challenges and still show that you could do it,"" she said, adding that the school's mission is to challenge the education status quo, all the while doing it under the same conditions as other public schools in the district. ""And today, with 100 percent of these kids having college plans, I think we showed we can do it."" The original vision called for a paperless and textbook-free school. Students were to be called learners. They would receive laptops for taking notes and tests and doing homework. Students repeated the school mission ""Continuous, Relevant, Adaptive"" with ease. ""Things did fall apart here as far as the original vision,"" said Iman Griffin, a senior and the school president, adding that students do use paper and textbooks now. ""But we aren't broken, we're still good, and I believe that I came out better."" Griffin, one of the 118 students who graduated on June 15, said she plans to attend Indiana University of Pennsylvania to study journalism. College wasn't always in the future for Mahcaiyah Wearing-Gooden. There were times during high school that she wanted to give up. She credits the caring staff and individual attention at school with helping to keep her on track. ""When I actually grasped the concept that my future is what I make it, and my future is what I do exactly, I didn't want to fail, I didn't want to give up, I wanted to succeed,"" said Wearing-Gooden, who plans to attend Green Mountain College in Vermont to study climatology. ""I wanted to be everything that everyone said that I couldn't be.""","Microsoft-designed School of the Future opened in Philadelphia in 2006 .

"A massive explosion at a train station in the Russian city of Volgograd killed at least 16 people, including one police officer, the Investigative Committee of Russia said on its website Sunday. See photos of the blast . The head of the committee, Vladimir Markin, said 16 people had been killed and 34 people were injured, including a 9-year-old girl. The suspected female suicide bomber set off the device before she could pass through a metal detector, Markin said, citing available information at the time. Later, Markin told Russian news agency Ria Novosti the remains of the bomber will undergo DNA testing. He said the bomber used the equivalent of 10 kilograms of TNT and included shrapnel. Investigators also found an unexploded grenade. Video taken from an outside security camera shows a huge fireball inside what appears to be the main entrance of the three-story stone building followed by a steady trail of smoke coming out shattered windows. The bombing occurred at about 12:45 p.m. local time (3:45 a.m. ET), officials said. President Vladimir Putin posted a message on the Kremlin's website sending his condolences to the family of those killed and wishing a quick recovery to those hurt. Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev ordered the emergency and health ministries to provide ""all necessary assistance"" to the wounded. Ria Novosti reported that the regional governor said at least half of the wounded are in critical condition. It is the second bombing in the southern Russian city in two months and comes less than six weeks ahead of the Winter Olympics in Sochi, located less than 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) from Volgograd. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack. ""There can be no justification for such barbarous attacks."" said NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen. ""NATO and Russia stand together in the fight against terrorism., including by working together on technology to prevent attacks on public transport systems."" A White House spokeswoman said, ""Our hearts go out to the victims and their families."" In October, a bomber blew up a passenger bus, killing six people and wounding more than 30 others. Russian media reported that a female Islamist suicide bomber from the Russian region of Dagestan was responsible for the attack. Volgograd, once called Stalingrad, is a major rail hub in the region, and each day thousands of passengers pass through the station, many on their way to Moscow. The station likely was packed with holiday travelers. The restive region of Chechnya is also located in this southern portion of Russia.","Russian news agency says remains of bomber to be examined .

"(CNN) -- Iran announced Monday that it has built its first ballistic missile silos, airing video of one of the facilities as it began a new round of military exercises. The hardened, underground launch sites will allow Iranian commanders to fire missiles more quickly, Iran's state-run Press TV reported. A military statement carried by the official Islamic Republic News Agency said the silos were capable of launching long-range missiles. The announcement came as the Islamic republic opened a new round of war games, dubbed ""Great Prophet 6."" Iran is expected to test-fire several types of missiles during the exercise, state news agencies reported. Iran's development of missile and nuclear fuel technology has led to U.N. sanctions and accusations from the United States that the clerical regime is trying to develop nuclear weapons. Iran says it has a right to peaceful nuclear technology, but the International Atomic Energy says it can't verify whether Tehran's nuclear program remains entirely peaceful. The United States and the Soviet Union built more than 1,400 silos to protect their long-range missiles during the Cold War era. In the Iranian statement, military spokesman Col. Asghar Ghelichkhani said the facilities were designed and built with domestic expertise. Western observers say Iran currently has missiles capable of hitting targets up to about 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) away, a range that would cover nearly the entire Middle East and part of southeastern Europe. Iran also launched its first satellite in 2009.","Iran airs video of the missile silos Monday .

"(CNN) -- In 1940, Hollywood's most popular comedian made a movie that subjected a world leader to ruthless parody, turning a brutal despot into a figure of fun. At the time, Adolf Hitler was consolidating his hold over Europe; the full monstrousness of Nazi atrocities were still to be revealed, and the United States was not yet at war with his regime. But the film had been controversial from the start. Two years earlier, German officials raised questions about it and the secretary of the British Board of Film Censors wrote to his American counterpart saying it could violate a rule against depicting a living person on screen without his consent. Of course, ""Dictator"" went on to become Charlie Chaplin's biggest commercial success, and is today regularly listed among the greatest films in Hollywood history. One wonders what would have become of ""The Great Dictator"" today, given Sony's decision Wednesday to respond to threats from anonymous hackers by yanking the raunchy North Korea satire ""The Interview"" with Seth Rogen and James Franco from theatrical release. Granted, it's unlikely that ""The Interview"" is in the same league as Chaplin's magnum opus -- given that the film's comedy rests on subtle, nuanced plot elements such as Rogen being forced to hide objects in his anus, I'm not even sure it's playing the same sport. And Sony was compelled to pull the film after being subjected to debilitating leaks that have cost it hundreds of millions in lost time and business, and confronted with a new set of cyberterrorist intimidations that included a promise of ""9/11-style violence"" -- threats that ultimately led a half-dozen of the biggest theater chains in the United States to announce that they would refuse to show ""The Interview"" if Sony chose to distribute it. Sony's surrender is more than just a humiliating black eye for one of the world's largest entertainment companies -- more, even, than the first notes of a dirge for the studio and its beleaguered leadership. It opens a new and insidious chapter in artistic censorship that raises the question of whether any work that lampoons or derides a powerful public figure or institution can now be made in today's entertainment industry. Art (and for this argument's purposes, let's include ""The Interview"" in the category of ""art"") has always been deeply intertwined with politics. Many of the greatest works in history would never have been created without the patronage of powerful world leaders and institutions, from kings and queens to religious faiths to merchant princelings. And of course, the flipside of the coin of patronage has always been repression: the Iconoclastic Controversy of Byzantine emperor Leo III; Hitler's purging of ""degenerate"" art; Mao's Cultural Revolution; more recently, the death threats and vandalizations that have accompanied displays of Andres Serrano's ""Piss Christ,"" a photo of a crucifix immersed in urine; the fatwa that sent Salman Rushdie into hiding for writing his literary fantasy ""The Satanic Verses""; the murder of filmmaker Theo van Gogh for making the documentary ""Submission,"" which questioned the treatment of women under Islam; and the controversies over the cartoon depiction of the Prophet Mohammed in the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten and on Comedy Central's ""South Park."" America's recent midterm elections were affected by the question of art's intersection with politics: The Benghazi riots that served as the backdrop for a militant assault that killed several U.S. diplomatic officials, including J. Christopher Stevens, the U.S. ambassador to Libya, were initially claimed to have been part of a global series of protests after the Internet release of an amateurish anti-Islam film called ""Innocence of Muslims."" What Sony's capitulation shows, however, is that in our postmodern era, shutting down the arts no longer requires jackbooted soldiers, raging mobs -- or even manifest physical danger. It doesn't matter if North Korea was originally behind the Sony hack; even if it was, it's certainly unlikely that the vague threats to public safety in the more recent warnings could ever have been carried out. But after Sony's decision, the mere threat of attack by shadowy digital forces may now be enough to forestall interest in depicting ""controversial"" public figures -- or subjects. And this chill won't be limited to political leaders. After all, any institution or individual can buy a black-hat hacker's time; a single individual with enough time and skills can wreak unprecedented havoc on a multibillion-dollar company, and some of the most brilliant inhabitants of the digital dark side do their dirty deeds for nothing but the promise of ""lulz."" So the question remains: Could ""The Great Dictator"" be made today? Could ""Team America: World Police""? What about HBO's forthcoming documentary on Scientology, ""Going Clear""? The repercussions from Sony's junking of ""The Interview"" are already being seen: Fox Studios and New Regency were working on a Steve Carell thriller set in North Korea that was ready to begin shooting in March. On Wednesday, they quietly killed the project. Sony could have stood its ground and decided to release the film, even if only in a single theater. It could have chosen to distribute it globally via on-demand streaming, and probably would have made hundreds of millions from curiosity-seekers and those who want to send a message against censorship. It might have even chosen to fight fire with fire, broadly releasing the film to pirate sites and illicit-sharing platforms as an upraised middle finger to those who tried to suppress it -- the money has already been spent on it, after all, and an act of bravura of that caliber might even have brought Sony a patina of cool. Instead, the dominoes will continue to fall. Sony has given saboteurs a virtual veto over its productions, and Hollywood seems likely to follow suit. In short, at least in this battle, the terrorists have won.","After anonymous threats, movie exhibitors and Sony canceled ""The Interview""

"London, England (CNN) -- Google agreed Friday to delete data it inadvertently collected from unsecured Wi-Fi networks when compiling its Street View mapping service in Britain, authorities said. The British government and privacy advocates have long been concerned about the personal data Google may have collected when its Street View cars drove around the country taking pictures for the service, which shows panoramic photographic views from street level. Google admitted its vehicles inadvertently captured so-called payload data but said it contained only fragments of content, according to the Information Commissioner's Office, which examined the data in August. The ICO agreed it was ""unlikely"" that the data contained significant amounts of personal information but said it was wrong for Google to have collected and stored the information. It also said the collecting of the details violated the Data Protection Act. On Friday, Google agreed to delete that data as soon as possible, the company and the ICO said. ""I am very pleased to have a firm commitment from Google to work with my office to improve its handling of personal information,"" Information Commissioner Christopher Graham said. ""We don't want another breach like the collection of payload data by Google Street View vehicles to occur again."" In addition to agreeing to delete the data, Google signed a commitment to improve data handling, the ICO said. Google Senior Vice President Alan Eustace agreed that the company will improve training measures on security awareness and data protection issues for all employees, the ICO said. The company has also said it will require its engineers to maintain a privacy design document for every new project before it is launched. After the Google cars canvassed the country in 2008, initial privacy concerns were about license plates being shown in the photographs or people being shown in embarrassing situations, like entering adult bookstores. Google later admitted its systems had captured communications -- including possibly passwords and e-mails -- from people using open Wi-Fi networks as the cars drove past. The issue has come up in other countries as well. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission investigated the same problem but concluded last month that Google had sufficiently addressed it. The FTC said Google promised it had not and would not use the payload data -- though unlike the case in Britain, Google did not promise to delete the information. Also in October, the Canadian government said Google broke the law by collecting the data, but it closed an investigation after calling it ""a careless error."" In France, a commission that began investigating over the summer ruled that personal data had been collected. Authorities cracked down, even pulling over Street View vehicles to make sure they had stopped collecting personal information. The Czech Republic has banned Google from expanding the service, and the news sparked an online privacy debate in Germany, where Google is allowing people to opt out of Street View before the images go live.

"She's a charming cetacean who one minute will allow you to put your arm around her -- and the next leave you nursing injuries. As swimmers off the west coast of Ireland are finding out, you don't mess with Dusty the dolphin. Now authorities have been forced to erect signs around Doolin Harbor, County Clare, after a woman was hospitalized last Sunday by the feisty bottlenose dolphin -- the fourth such incident since May. Dusty has a checkered history in the area. First spotted in the waters off the coast of County Clare in 2000, reports began to surface as far back as 2004 that she was a little temperamental. According to media reports, one diver even claimed that Dusty had tried to drown her. Officials say that a record has never been kept of precisely how many incidents Dusty has been involved in -- but they believe that the number has escalated this year. Village suggest this could be because Dusty moved to Doolin Harbour -- which is much more heavily populated with swimmers than her previous hunting ground -- back in 2011. In the latest incident, the Irish Whale and Dolphin Group reports that Dusty rammed a woman in the abdomen resulting in her hospitalization. It's only the latest in a series of incidents, the group says, with one woman having to be flown back to Germany via air ambulance as a result of her injuries. The IWDG also warns that pursuing Dusty could also result in an injury or even a fatality. And don't even think about trying to take her picture. As one sign states: ""If she does grab a camera etc, let her have it, or she might ram you or hit you with her tail."" Clare County Council has now commissioned the IWDG to produce advisory posters warning people not to approach Dusty. It has also asked lifeguards to put out red warning flags whenever Dusty is spotted in the area. But beyond that there's little else the authorities can do: the bottlenose dolphin -- which can grow up to 10-feet long -- is an endangered species and is protected under law. Swimmers on the west coast of Ireland -- beware.","Reports suggest Dusty the dolphin, found on the west coast of Ireland, has attacked swimmers .

"Lt. Timothy Breen flies missions close to Iranian air space almost every day in his U.S. Navy F-18 Hornet, often encountering Iranian military aircraft over the strategic waters of the Strait of Hormuz. Breen's squadron, the Blue Blasters, are currently stationed aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln, a huge aircraft carrier whose presence in the region is testament to the escalating tensions between the West and Iran. He says in almost all cases, the interaction between U.S. and Iranian pilots is professional -- they stay out of each other's way. But he also knows, the Abraham Lincoln is here to make sure the Iranians don't overstep their boundaries. ""We have a responsibility to our coalition partners and to the world just to help make sure that freedom of navigation is going along smoothly and that people can feel safe transiting international waters,"" Breen said during a recent CNN visit to the carrier. He is referring to Iran's repeated threats to close the Strait of Hormuz as Tehran steps up its defiance in response to international sanctions. Any move to block the narrow waterway between Iran and Oman could affect 20% of the world's oil supply including 90% of Iraq's resurgent oil exports. ""We've heard the rhetoric about them possibly closing the Strait of Hormuz and we just remain vigilant as we come through,"" said Rear Admiral Troy Shoemaker, who led a carrier strike group that this week escorted the Abraham Lincoln as the carrier on its second passage through the Strait this year. Shoemaker says his crew takes care not to provoke Iran through its maneuvering, but at the same is prepared to answer any military escalation by Iran's navy. The U.S. believes any attempt by Iran to shut down the Hormuz waterway might involve missile or sea mine attacks on merchant vessels. ""It doesn't take many mines to be effective, to have an effect,"" Shoemaker said. ""There is a potential to do that and we are prepared to monitor it and respond with capabilities that are in theater."" The U.S. Navy says it is ready to counter threats in the Persian Gulf. And aboard the Abraham Lincoln, the crew works round the clock to ensure the carrier is always capable of launching its aircraft. A massive arsenal stores millions of pounds of laser and GPS-guided ordnance. Several maintenance decks in the ship's hull can conduct almost any maintenance required, from electronics to engine repairs. A crew of the dozens of people needed to get a plane into the air are always on standby. Among these, the so-called ""shooter"" is in charge of operations on deck and gives the final go for the fighters to take off. Shooters are also responsible for monitoring the pressure of the massive steam-powered catapults that propel the planes from 0-160 miles an hour in about 2 seconds. Too much and the plane could get torn apart, too little and it would stall and crash into the water. ""We can launch four aircraft in about a minute, then we takes a few minutes to re load the catapults and get next batch of aircraft into position,"" said Lt. Cmdr. Mike Givens, one of the shooters. Most crew members don't talk directly about the potential Iranian threat in the region and will only say they are prepared to deal with anything that comes up. The commander of the USS Abraham Lincoln, Cpt. John D. Alexander, says the vast majority of encounters with the Iranian Navy are routine and professional, with ships or planes monitoring the carrier or trying to establish radio contact for routine queries. Nevertheless, Iran's fleet, though old and equipped with only small surface vessels and submarines, can pose a danger even to a super carrier. ""They have small boats, they have bigger boats, they have submarines, they have pretty much the gambit of things,"" Alexander says. The U.S. Navy speaks of scenarios in which Iran could launch sudden, almost insurgent style attacks on larger, better-equipped U.S. warships. So far, however, that has not happened and there were no major incidents during Abraham Lincoln's recent passage through the Strait. The carrier is now on its way to new mission to support NATO forces in Afghanistan, but as international concerns over Iran persist, America's presence in the Persian Gulf will remain.","U.S. pilots say they have had daily encounters with Iranian aircraft over Strait of Hormuz .

"The Apple Watch will sell for $349 when it hits stores next year. Motorola's Moto 360 goes for $249 and Samsung's smartwatch, the Galaxy Gear, starts at $199. Now, a Chinese company wants to sell you one for $7. Fastfox, a technology startup, says keeping software simple and hardware minimal lets them offer a smart wristband starting at prices nowhere near their fancier counterparts in the growing wearable-tech space. The company has launched a campaign to release the watches on Australian crowdfunding site Pozible. They offered 100 of the wristbands at $7. All of those have been snapped up, but donors can still get a black Fastfox watch for $8. And for $9, they can get a Fastfox in the color and design of their choice. The campaign's highest donation level, $684, gets you 100 of the smartbands in the colors of your choice. The campagin ends on Dec. 24. As of Thursday it had raised more than $7,200 from 529 supporters. ""Smart wearables have the potential to be incredibly useful, especially in the data they can provide to people trying to forge healthy habits,"" Fastfox creator Liu Chao said in a news release. ""But the price is a big turn-off."" Like some of its contemporaries, including the forthcoming Apple Watch, Fastfox's limited array of apps are, indeed, heavily weighted toward health and fitness.

"(CNN) -- With gas prices inching their way back up and traffic in most metropolitan areas bottlenecking along any rush-hour route, it's a wonder that the majority of the modern office workforce doesn't telecommute. A self-admitted tech geek, Chris Pirillo is president of Lockergnome.com, a blogging network. The sad fact is that many bosses and personnel departments refuse to see the value in allowing their underlings the freedom to work from home in spite of the massive cost savings of business overhead (i.e. office space rental, work stations, parking, etc.) and potentially increased productivity. How can employees be working, these short-sighted micromanagers muse, if they're not monitored for every second they're on the clock? Who's going to make sure they're taking their allotted 30-minute lunches and 10-minute breaks? Who will crack the whip when the personal phone calls and water cooler chit-chat get out of hand? Stuck in the mindset of the 19th-century business model like Dickensian Scrooges, these uninformed overseers fail to see how grown adults could possibly be trusted to monitor their own work habits and get their jobs done without the ""benefit"" of managerial...guidance. They don't understand how constant meddling (i.e., calling endless meetings, tapping their watches parentally when employees return from lunch two minutes late, interrupting the general flow by introducing empty priority items over work already in progress, etc.) hinders -- rather than stimulates -- overall office morale and productivity. Let's say your job really is something that doesn't require you to be shackled to a desk in some office loft's cubicle sprawlscape. You have a daily checklist of tasks that need to be done and, regardless of whatever distractions may come your way, you've got the discipline to make sure you get those tasks crossed off before the personnel department's officially permitted quitting time. What do you say to a boss who, for no sane reason on God's green earth, resists a sensible appeal for allowing you to telecommute? It's tempting to parrot the immortal words of Redd Foxx's Fred Sanford and say: ""You big dummy!"" But don't. Don't. Sure, it'd probably save you the agony of your daily commute, but... On the other hand, if you're lucky enough to work in a place that does allow you to telecommute but the person who needs the most convincing is you, here are some of the best reasons I can come up with (maybe you'll think of more -- if so, drop me a line and share!): . 1. You'll save money on gas and car repairs, and possibly insurance since you'll be traveling less miles every day. 2. No more random interruptions from the office busybody. 3. Worried about not having enough social interaction? Do your work at home and hang out with people of your own choosing afterward instead of whoever you get stuck with all day long at the office! Sure, those social circles may overlap and you might actually enjoy the company of people with whom you happen to work, but my point here is that telecommuting gives you options. 4. Spend a good chunk of your day on the Internet? The office will likely pay for your home broadband connection! 5. Need to share a presentation with someone? Think about putting it up on SlideShare. 6. Need to collaborate on a spreadsheet? Use Google Docs! Stop sending file attachments, already! Seriously, if you've learned nothing else from this article, it's the benefit of using a service like Google Docs. 7. Need to look at someone's desktop remotely? I bet your company's system administrator has a tool for the job. 8. Need to take notes with a group, even if you're not in the same room together? Check out Etherpad.com. 9. Need some kind of radio playing in the background, just for that old-time officey feel? Point a Web browser to Pandora.com or Last.fm. You can define your own stations instantly, based on music and artists you love. 10. Monitor your eating habits, because (I'm telling you) you'll snack more at home than you do at work -- it's too convenient. Hey, I had to throw in at least one caveat, right? Still reading this at the office in spite of being offered the option to telecommute by your progressive, 21st-century, forward-thinking company? What the heck are you waiting for, you big dummy?","CNN tech columnist Chris Pirillo offers his reasons to try working from home .

"The New York Times website was still experiencing some issues late Wednesday and early Thursday following a widespread outage. Evidence continued to mount that it was the result of an attack by the Syrian Electronic Army. The group, loyal to Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad, has been behind multiple attacks on media websites in recent months and, on Twitter, took credit for a sophisticated hack that had hobbled the Times' news site for roughly 20 hours. ""The @nytimes attack was going to deliver an anti-war message but our server couldn't last for 3 minutes,"" the group posted on its Twitter feed at about 9:40 Wednesday morning. The attack came as governments in several countries considered military action in light of reports that Al-Assad has used chemical weapons against his own people in an effort to quell an uprising calling for his ouster. ""Our website and domain are now down, but it was worth the attempt, for #Syria and world peace,"" the group wrote later. What is the Syrian Electronic Army? The group said their site was taken down because they violated their registration agreement. People on Twitter began reporting the New York Times site was down as early as 3 p.m. ET Tuesday. Some users also reported difficulty accessing the Times' mobile site and apps. The newspaper posted a message on its Facebook page about 5 p.m. ET that said, ""Many users are having difficulty accessing The New York Times online. We are working to fix the problem. Our initial assessment is the outage is most likely the result of a malicious external attack."" New York Times chief information officer Marc Frons sent the same update internally to employees at 4:20 p.m. and advised them not to send out sensitive emails ""until this situation is resolved,"" according to a statement from the New York Times. The outage was the result of an attack on the company's domain name registrar, Melbourne IT. The hackers gained access to a Melbourne IT reseller account using a phishing email and proceeded to change the DNS records of multiple domains, including NYTimes.com, according to the company. ""We are currently reviewing our logs to see if we can obtain information on the identity of the party that has used the reseller credentials, and we will share this information with the reseller and any relevant law enforcement bodies,"" said Melbourne IT's Tony Smith in a statement. Twitter also was hampered briefly by a similar attack. Several Twitter users posted screenshots of a ""Hacked by SEA"" message they said they received when they went to the New York Times homepage. The Syrian Electronic Army has frequently targeted the U.S. news media. The group has hacked into the Twitter feeds of the Associated Press and The Washington Post, and on August 15 they briefly hacked the websites of several major news organizations redirecting them to a SEA page. CNN.com has been the target of similar attacks. Frons said Tuesday's attack was more sophisticated than previous SEA hacks. ""It's sort of like breaking into the local savings and loan versus breaking into Fort Knox. A domain registrar should have extremely tight security because they are holding the security to hundreds if not thousands of Web sites,"" said Frons in the New York Times. While the site was down, the New York Times continued to post articles at its numerical IP address, 170.149.168.130 and at news.nytco.com. Tuesday's episode was the Times' second sustained website outage this month. The newspaper's site also went down August 14 for several hours, an outage the newspaper blamed on ""an internal issue."" In an update on a company blog, Twitter confirmed that there was a DNS issue with one of the domains used to host images. ""Viewing of images and photos was sporadically impacted. By 22:29 UTC, the original domain record for twimg.com was restored. No Twitter user information was affected by this incident,"" said the post.","New York Times site still experiencing problems following Tuesday outage .

"The embattled head of the Internal Revenue Service blames faulty technology for what he called serious problems under investigation by Congress, the Justice Department and the Treasury inspector general. John Koskinen told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Thursday that he apologized to anyone who had their application for tax-exempt status held up by IRS targeting of political labels. ""The improper criteria used to highlight organizations for investigation just by their name was a mistake,"" Koskinen said. ""I apologize to anybody who ever had their applications held up needlessly. Everybody needs to be confident that the IRS is going to treat them fairly no matter who they are. Republicans, Democrats, whatever organization they belong to. So it's a serious matter."" However, he maintained that evidence uncovered so far by six investigations found no involvement by the White House, as alleged by some Republicans. In particular, GOP critics contend a hard drive crash that wiped out e-mails of the woman at the center of the controversy -- former IRS official Lois Lerner -- looked like a cover-up. ""It is suspicious. When we uncovered it, we pursued evidence,"" Koskinen said, adding that the agency also looked at other hard-drive failures in recent years. ""I think we need to pull all this together, see what we know and proceed."" At the same time, he noted technology problems occurred regularly, with 2,000 hard drives failing so far this year at the agency, which has about 90,000 employees. Fed official: IRS did not follow the line . Congressional Republicans pummeled Koskinen with questions and accusations this week, all but accusing him of perjury. But he hit back at committee hearings and in the CNN interview. ""It's not my intention at all to play games with the Congress,"" he said, adding that ""people need to feel comfortable that it's not a politicized agency, that it treats people fairly whoever they are."" Asked by Blitzer whether he regretted taking the job, Koskinen joked he should have read the fine print ahead of time. No regrets, he added, citing the need to fulfill an important public service. A government veteran, the 74-year-old Koskinen is taking the brunt of congressional pressure after the agency admitted it lost thousands of e-mails wanted by lawmakers investigating the targeting scandal. Rep. Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, flat out questioned whether Koskinen was being truthful with Congress, and Darrell Issa, the Oversight chairman, called him out for being evasive. On Thursday, Koskinen repeated his belief that an independent prosecutor would be unnecessary and a waste of taxpayer dollars with the other investigations underway. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas said Thursday that Attorney General Eric Holder, a frequent target of GOP attacks, should be impeached for refusing to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the missing Lerner e-mails. ""Make no mistakes. These e-mails haven't just been lost,"" Cruz said on the Senate floor. ""These e-mails have been deleted, taped over and the hard drive physically destroyed, according to public news reports."" Asked by Blitzer whether a criminal investigation was warranted, Koskinen replied: ""I don't think ... at this time there's any evidence of that."" Top IRS official beats back Republican barrage . Lerner, who ran the division that carried out the IRS targeting, resigned last year after the Treasury Department's inspector general found those working under her used ""inappropriate"" criteria to scrutinize certain groups, particularly those with conservative political names. Since then, she has refused to testify at hearings, invoking her constitutional right not to do so. Earlier this month, the IRS told Congress that a 2011 crash of Lerner's computer hard drive meant that e-mails until that point had been lost. The IRS targeting was first noticed by the agency after that time. Koskinen noted Thursday that the agency had recovered 24,000 Lerner e-mails by other means and was cooperating fully with all investigations of the matter. When Blitzer noted that taxpayers believe the IRS would never accept the excuse of a hard drive crash for filing an improper return, Koskinen responded that the agency tries to work with people to resolve the situation. ""We historically, if a taxpayer has lost electronic records, have said if you have other indications and evidence of what went on, we'll take that from you,"" he said. ""If you lose a document, it doesn't mean you lose the argument. We actually work with taxpayers to say we'll look at other evidence ... and if we can find any evidence to support your case -- and, in fact, if the circumstances support your case, we'll support you and you won't have any problems."" On Wednesday, a Republican congressman revealed Lerner e-mails that asked whether the IRS should look into an invitation for GOP Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa to appear at a seminar. The disclosure of the e-mail exchanges by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp of Michigan further inflamed GOP sentiment against Lerner. However, it was not clear from the e-mails whether Lerner was referring to an audit of Grassley personally or the group that invited him and was possibly offering to pay for his wife to attend. Her lawyer said Lerner acted appropriately, and Koskinen said Thursday the intent was unclear. Democrats accuse House Republicans of politicizing the IRS investigation, noting that some liberal seeking tax exempt status also were also targeted by the agency.

"It is rare for women and men in Iran to enjoy the thrill of sports together in public, but it happened over the weekend when several restaurants and cafes appeared to ignore a ban on broadcasting the World Cup. Inside one Tehran coffee shop, a young, veiled Iranian woman held her fiancé's hand tightly as the seconds ticked down in Iran's heart-stopping World Cup match against South American powerhouse Argentina. Another woman gently bit her French-manicured nails as she sat between two male friends who were drenched with nervous sweat and fast losing their voices. Throughout the rest of the cafe other women intermittently cheered, gasped, and shouted instructions at the direction of the big screen TV. ""100 percent it's better this way,"" said Negar Valayi. ""It doesn't happen often. It would be great if we have more of this."" ""It's actually much better to watch it with a bunch of people around because it makes you feel more excited,"" said Roya Marzbahan. Authorities in Iran banned women from entering most sporting events following the 1979 Islamic Revolution because mixed crowds enjoying games was deemed un-Islamic. For the past 35 years, the crowds at football games -- Iran's most popular sport -- have been all male. Iranian women were briefly allowed to attend volleyball matches during the presidency of moderate Mohammad Khatami but the ban was reinstated in 2005 when Mahmoud Ahmadinejad came to power. In an apparent effort to avoid mixed crowds watching this year's World Cup, authorities warned restaurants not to broadcast games. ""We were told not to turn on the TV because it might create some problems,"" a restaurant hostess told CNN on the phone. In more subtle measures designed to deter mixed crowds, women don't appear on World Cup billboards throughout Tehran, and state TV uses a delay of several seconds during matches to censor images of female fans deemed too racy for viewers. But in a country where conservative social norms often clash with a young, defiant, fun-loving population, women have continued to demand equality. Earlier this month, several Iranian women snuck into a men's volleyball match in Tehran disguised as Brazilian fans, state media reported. Others protested outside the match. ""We have rights too. We should be able to go to games,"" said Negar Valayi. ""They're taking our rights,"" said Roya Marzbahan. ""It's our right to watch our teams."" This month state media reported that female Vice President Shahindokht Molaverdi was ""investigating"" the ban on women attending volleyball matches -- a sign perhaps that Iran's moderate President Hassan Rouhani is heeding Iranian women's demand for equal rights to enjoy sports.","Women defy ban on watching sports with men to cheer on Iran in World Cup .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. State Department launched a new Farsi-language Twitter feed Sunday in a bid to connect with internet users in Iran. ""US State Dept recognizes historic role of social media among Iranians. We want to join in your conversations,"" the department said in its first tweet. The feed was launched just one day before opposition leaders and activists in Iran have called for a protest in support of the Egyptian revolution, according to Saham News. The rally is planned to coincide with the 25th day of Bahman, the 11th month of the Persian calendar. Following the resignation Friday of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, the head of Iran's National Security Council, among other Iranian authorities, lauded the leader's toppling, comparing ""the Egyptian Revolution with the victory of Iran's Islamic Revolution,"" according to Iran's state-run media. But while publicly praising the Egyptian uprising, the government has rounded up activists after Iran's two leading opposition figures called for Monday's rally. Opposition leaders Mehdi Karroubi and Mir Hossein Moussavi asked that the rally take place in Tehran's Azadi Square, the site of mass protests by Iran's opposition movement after the disputed 2009 presidential elections. ""Iran has shown that the activities it praised Egyptians for it sees as illegal, illegitimate for its own people,"" the State Department said in its second tweet. In its third tweet, the department called on Iran to allow people the same right to demonstrate as Egyptians had in Cairo. The Farsi-language feed had eight followers as of Sunday night.

"In his speech about ISIS last week, President Barack Obama said, ""American military power is unmatched, but this can't be America's fight alone."" Allies and partners of the United States, Obama vowed, would provide support to degrade and eventually destroy the militant group that has slaughtered many people in Iraq and Syria and beheaded two American journalists and a British aid worker. The United States has conducted more than 150 airstrikes in Iraq against ISIS, and Secretary of State John Kerry has said nearly 40 nations have agreed to contribute to the fight against the militants. But it remains unclear which countries are on that list and the precise role they'll play. On Sunday, Kerry said countries in the Middle East are willing to help with strikes against ISIS, but he said on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" that ""it's not appropriate to start announcing"" which nations will participate and what each will do. Those statements come as ISIS beheaded a third Western captive, Briton David Haines, and as Kerry ended a weeklong trip to the Middle East to drum up support for the battle against the militants. An international conference convened Monday in Paris, where there was more discussion of a coalition. After the meeting, the French government released general points the parties adopted to push against ISIS. On September 17, in a speech to service members at Central Command in Tampa, Florida, Obama said that Saudi Arabia has ""agreed to host our efforts to train and equip Syria opposition forces"" to fight ISIS. He mentioned several other nations, and the roles they are playing, detailed below. So far, this is what's known about the nations involved and their contributions: .

Australia will also help to stem the humanitarian crisis. Obama said on September 17 that Australia will send military advisers to Iraq.

France: France has begun reconnaissance flights over Iraq, the French Defense Ministry said. Two Rafale air force planes took off from an air base in the United Arab Emirates, the ministry said. France has contributed 18,000 rounds of .50-caliber ammunition in the fight against ISIS, a senior U.S. State Department official told reporters Sunday during a background briefing. It's protocol for officials giving the information not to be quoted by name. France's air force was also part of a recent operation in the Iraqi town of Amerli that pushed back ISIS fighters and, along with Australia and Great Britain, has performed humanitarian aid drops in Iraq. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi told reporters in Baghdad on Friday that French President François Hollande promised that France ""will participate in efforts to hit terrorist locations in Iraq."" Germany: Geared toward curbing ISIS propaganda and recruitment, Germany has banned activities that support ISIS, including making it illegal to fly the trademark black flag of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Germany has also said it was sending military assistance to the Kurdish region to fight ISIS. Obama said on September 17 that German paratroopers are offering training in the overall effort to fight ISIS. Netherlands: In Sunday's briefing, a State Department official praised the Netherlands for ""leading an effort"" to help curb the flow of foreign fighters coming into the country who may be empathetic to ISIS or assisting it in some way. Dutch leaders have proposed amending national law that would revoke citizenship to those who work with terrorists, The New York Times reported. Canada: A State Department official said Sunday that Canada has provided ""tangible equipment and ammunition"" to the broader effort to fight ISIS. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced just days ago that more than 50 Canadian special operations troops are being deployed to Iraq as part of an adviser mission but that there would be no direct military intervention by the country, according to CTV. On Sunday, State Department officials also called out Italy, Poland, Denmark, Albania and Croatia for providing equipment and ammunition in the fight against ISIS. New Zealand, Romania and South Korea were also named for providing humanitarian assistance, with specifics on South Korea giving some $1.2 million. Turkey: U.S. officials say Turkey has taken steps to cut the flow of money to ISIS and denied entry to or deported several thousand foreign fighters heading to Syria to join the extremists, CNN's Elise Labott and Tom Cohen reported Friday. The United States is hoping Turkey will stop oil exports from ISIS-held areas that bring more funding to the group, they write in a piece that examined who is signing on to aid the West fight ISIS. Jordan: Former Jordanian Foreign Minister Marwan Muasher said on CNN on Sunday that he doubts Jordan will commit ground troops in the fight against ISIS. ""The U.S. will have to take the lead in providing military strikes,"" he said. Jordan's key role would be providing intelligence to the West, Muasher said. Speaking from Amman, he stressed that Jordan's intelligence on ISIS is ""second to none."" Saudi Arabia: On Thursday, Kerry met with Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal in Jeddah. U.S. officials say that Saudi Arabia has offered to train rebels on its soil. In a short session with reporters Thursday, al-Faisal and Kerry took questions. Al-Faisal appeared to avoid giving specifics but said that Saudi Arabia has ""always taken initiatives with regard to a firm position towards terrorists and against them. So there is no limit to what the Kingdom can provide in this regard."" The United States also wants Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Egypt to use Arab television networks to spread anti-ISIS messages and encourage more clerics to speak out against the group. Saudi Arabia has also put $500 million into the coffers of the U.N. humanitarian aid agencies in Iraq, a senior State Department official said Sunday. CNN's Labott asked Kerry whether Saudi Arabia supports the extremist expressions of the Wahhabism version of Islam espoused by some terror groups. Kerry responded that the kingdom is ""deeply committed to the effort to terminate"" ISIS. A significant part of the counterterrorism effort against the militants includes cutting off money to terror groups, Kerry said. Egypt: Kerry said Saturday that Egypt has a critical role to play in countering ISIS ideology. There was a ""very detailed conversation with the Egyptians about military-to-military cooperation"" in Iraq, State Department officials said Sunday, but there appear to be no public details about the role Egypt may play. Signaling a major cultural push against ISIS, last week, Egypt's grand mufti reportedly condemned the terror group, saying that its actions are not in line with Islam. Qatar: Qatar has flown a number of humanitarian flights, State Department officials said. Iran: Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei said Monday on Twitter that he has rejected the possibility of cooperating with the United States ""because (the) US has corrupted its hands in this issue."" Khamenei accused the United States of planning to use military action against ISIS to ""dominate the region."" Iraqi Kurdistan: Leaders of the semiautonomous region of Iraq are willing to send their Peshmerga forces to fight beyond their borders if there's a comprehensive international strategy put in place, President Masoud Barzani told CNN's Anna Coren. A senior U.S. military official told CNN that ""more than one Arab nation"" has offered to carry out what the official described as ""kinetic"" actions, such as airstrikes against ISIS. Kerry said in a CBS interview aired Sunday that some nations also have offered to commit ground troops. Senior State Department and U.S. military officials said Monday that Kerry was not referring to foreign forces, whether Western or Arab. They are ""indigenous"" forces; that is, Syrian and Iraqi troops, including trained Syrian rebels, Iraqi forces, Kurdish forces and Sunni tribes, the officials said.","France has begun reconnaissance flights over Iraq, its Defense Ministry says .

"U.S. student Amanda Knox and her former Italian boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito have had their sentences in the murder case of British student Meredith Kercher upheld by an Italian court. Knox, who is currently living in the United States, had her sentence increased to 28 years and six months. Sollecito, who returned to Italy during the trial, was sentenced to 25 years. Why were Knox and Sollecito back on trial? In 2009, they were convicted of killing Kercher, 21, who was found stabbed in November 2007 in the villa that she and Knox rented in the central Italian university town of Perugia. The convictions of Knox, from Seattle, and Sollecito were overturned in 2011 for ""lack of evidence."" But Italy's Supreme Court decided in March 2013 to retry the case, saying the jury that acquitted them didn't consider all the evidence and discrepancies in testimony needed to be answered. What was different about this trial? Despite the ruling of the Supreme Court, there was little difference in the evidence or details of the case, and prior to Thursday's verdict it was unclear how presiding judge Alessandra Nencini would rule. When Knox was first convicted of murder, there was outcry in the U.S. that she was wrongfully convicted, based on shoddy evidence. When she was acquitted, there was nearly as much of an outcry in Italy that the courts had succumbed to American pressure. Timeline: Kercher murder case . Did the defendants attend the retrial? The retrial began on September 30 without either of them in court. Sollecito was in the Dominican Republic at the start of the retrial but returned to Italy. He took the stand in November, defending himself. ""I would like to make you understand that these charges against me are absurd,"" he said. ""There was not a basis to charge me, to put me in jail. ... I don't wish anybody on Earth to go through what I went through."" He said that evidence against him -- including a knife that was a key part of the prosecution's case -- was ""an illusion."" Knox returned to Seattle after her 2011 acquittal and has been living there since. She says she is afraid to return to Italy, where she spent four years behind bars. She again maintained her innocence in a written statement to the Florence court. ""I must repeat to you. I'm innocent. I did not rape, I did not steal ... I did not kill Meredith,"" Knox said a lengthy e-mail, written in Italian, which was presented to the court by her lawyer. What will happen to Knox now? Despite Thursday's verdict, the case is not necessarily closed. Either side can appeal a verdict they are unhappy with, under Italy's three-strike trial system. This could also mean the case would continue with no immediate outcome. Even though Knox was convicted this time around, it is unclear if she will return to Italy. CNN's legal analyst Sonny Hostin said that U.S. law dictates that a person cannot be tried twice on the same charge. ""Because of this tension between Italian and U.S. law it is unlikely that U.S. law will extradite her. When the fight begins those are the grounds that U.S. attorneys will be arguing."" However, another legal expert disagreed. ""They always forget she was convicted first,"" Julian Ku, who teaches transnational law at Hofstra University in New York, told Agence-France Presse. If Italy does file an extradition request with the U.S. State Department, Knox will have the right to challenge her transfer to Italy in a U.S. court. ""The chances of her winning that are not high because there has to be some very strong claim she'd have to make to block her extradition,"" Ku added. ""I followed the trial, it was slow but I never got the sense that it was unfair,"" he said. Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz added: ""As popular as she is here and as pretty as she is here -- because that's what this is all about, if she was not an attractive woman we wouldn't have the group love-in -- she will be extradited if it's upheld. ""The Italian legal system, though I don't love it, is a legitimate legal system and we have a treaty with Italy so I don't see how we would resist,"" he told AFP. ""We're trying to get (fugitive NSA leaker Edward) Snowden back -- how does it look if we want Snowden back and we won't return someone for murder?"" he asked. There is a valid extradition agreement between Italy and the U.S., but the U.S. has not set much of a precedence in returning suspects for such matters. Italians point to a number of high-profile cases over the years in which they say American suspects have been accused of wrongdoing and criminal acts, but have been let off lightly. In 1998, an American military jet clipped a ski lift cable, sending a gondola of 20 passengers to their deaths in the Italian Dolomite Mountains. Italian prosecutors wanted the crew of the jet tried in Italy, but an Italian court ruled they should face courts-martial in the U.S., in accordance with NATO treaties. The aircraft's pilot and navigator were found not guilty of involuntary manslaughter, even though the military admitted the plane had been flying lower and faster than authorized. When it emerged that a video that captured the accident from inside the plane had been destroyed, they were dismissed from the Marine Corps. Italians were outraged, referring to the incident as the ""massacre of Cermis."" In another incident that raised tensions, Egyptian cleric Abu Omar was seized off the streets of Milan in 2003 and smuggled to Egypt, where he says he was tortured and released four years later. Although Italy did not request the extradition of any of the suspects, 22 CIA agents were convicted in absentia of the kidnapping and sentenced to prison time for their role in the abduction, but none ever served time in Italy. What will happen to Sollecito now that he has been found guilty for a second time? Because Sollecito is an Italian citizen and currently living in Italy, he will not have to face extradition. He is unlikely to be jailed until his appeal has been heard -- and that could take months -- but authorities ordered that his passport be revoked. Hours later Italian authorities stopped Sollecito in the northern Italian town of Udine, near the border with Austria and Slovenia, police said. What has been the reaction of Kercher's family? The Kercher family has welcomed the ruling, which overturns the previous decision to acquit Knox and Sollecito. ""They are tired of this and want justice,"" Francesci Maresca, the family's attorney, said. ""I think we are still on the journey to the truth,"" said Kercher's sister Stephanie. ""I think it may be the fact that we don't ever really know what happened that night, which is obviously something we will have to come to terms with."" Lyle Kercher, Meredith's brother, said the family may have to wait until spring 2015 for a final resolution, since the verdicts reached Thursday can still be appealed at Italy's Supreme Court. ""Nothing is going to bring Meredith back, nothing will take away the horror of what happened for her,"" he said. ""The best we can hope for is finally bringing this whole case to a conclusion, having a conviction, and everyone can move on with their lives.""

"The quest for peace in Syria is now crippled with setbacks, as a U.N. observer mission has suspended operations and attempts to rescue civilians trapped amid violence have proved futile. At least 71 people were killed Monday, the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The dead included ""entire families trapped under rubble"" when regime forces shelled the city of Douma, according to the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria. ""Nobody can rescue the victims because of the continuous shelling,"" the LCC said. Government forces also shelled the southern town of Tafas after more than 80 tanks entered the town, killing three people, the LCC said. It accused ""security forces and thugs"" of using children in Tafas as human shields on their tanks to prevent possible attacks by the opposition Free Syrian Army. Also Monday, the Standard Club, a British marine insurer, said that it had stopped coverage for Russian operator Femco's cargo ship, MV Alaed, amid allegations that it is carrying weapons to the Syrian government. U.S. officials have said the ship is carrying attack helicopters and munitions from the port of Kaliningrad. Increased violence in Syria in recent days so exacerbated the already risky situation faced by the approximately 300 unarmed monitors that the United Nations announced Saturday it was suspending the operation. The LCC issued a statement saying the decision ""represents a failure of ... the international community to effectively and responsibly deal with the situation in Syria."" Officials from the Syrian National Council said the suspension indicated it was time for world leaders to take more severe steps. ""We say that all options are there and must be put on the table,"" said Abdul Basit Sieda, the group's leader. ""This regime only understands the language of violence and force."" In Washington, Sen. John McCain called Monday for just that. ""The Syrian opposition needs to know that the United States stands with them and that we are willing to take risks to support them when they need it the most,"" the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee told an audience at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. ""Inaction denies us the opportunity to have influence with forces in Syria who will one day inherit the country, ceding that to foreign states that may not always share our values."" McCain took aim at what he said is the Obama administration's toothless policy of calling for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step aside. ""To say they are leading from behind is too generous,"" he said. ""That suggests they are leading. They are just behind."" The Republican senator from Arizona accused the administration, ""in its desperation,"" of appearing to place its hopes on persuading the Russian government to push al-Assad from power. President Barack Obama met with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday at the G-20 meeting in Los Cabos, Mexico. Afterward, the two leaders issued a statement calling for ""an immediate cessation of all violence"" and expressing support for efforts by U.N. and Arab League joint special envoy Kofi Annan to broker a peace deal. That elicited derision from McCain. ""It was the kind of statement that you usually hear when there's no concrete agreement,"" he told CNN. ""Also, it's a little weird, Orwellian, to consider their statement supporting Kofi Annan's initiative."" McCain described the Annan plan as ""a total failure."" In his speech, McCain said any military aid should not include U.S. ground forces, but should include other military might from the United States and its allies, such as European and other Arab countries. McCain rejected characterizations of the current state of affairs inside Syria as a civil war. ""It's not a civil war because all the military strength is on one side, and not the other,"" he said. ""At least we ought to give them a chance to have a fair fight."" The suspension of the monitoring mission is a major blow to Annan's peace plan, which had become a symbol of hope for a country torn by relentless attacks during the 15-month uprising. The Syrian government has blamed the violence on ""armed terrorist groups,"" the vaguely defined entities it has consistently blamed over the past year. Syrian opposition groups say more than 13,000 people have been killed since al-Assad's government started cracking down on anti-government protesters last year. The United Nations' latest estimate puts the death toll at more than 10,000. CNN cannot independently verify government and opposition claims of casualties because the Syrian government has restricted access by international journalists.","At least 71 people were killed Monday, an opposition group says .

"Homicide detectives here say they are exploring every possible avenue, as they investigate the assassination-style killing of an Iranian dissident in mid-January. Gelareh Bagherzadeh, 30, was shot and killed on January 15 as she drove her father's car home just before midnight. She was studying molecular genetic technology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. ""The evidence indicated that she had been shot through the passenger side window,"" Houston Police Sgt. J.C. Padilla said.   ""She was shot one time, and an autopsy revealed she had been shot in the head."" Bagherzadeh had come to Houston in 2007, her friends said.   Before her arrival, they say, she had traveled throughout Europe, living in Paris and, for a time, in Budapest. Her father had once worked for the Iranian Oil ministry, according to police. In 2010, not long after the disputed presidential elections in Iran, Bagherzadeh joined a group called SabzHouston, formed to protest the election results.   She was videotaped by a reporter for the Houston Chronicle while on a street corner, saying she was showing support for ""brothers and sisters suffering in Iran."" ""That's why we gather here,"" she said in the taped account, ""to be their voice here and show them we are together, and they are not alone."" She wasn't scared to show her face, but she said she wouldn't give her last name to reporters for fear of retaliation. Police investigating her killing have found no one who would have wanted to kill Bagherzadeh.  With nothing stolen or missing, they've ruled out a random robbery.  Police said they are looking into whether her involvement with the protest movement had anything to do with her killing. ""Right now ... because of obvious reasons, we're exploring those issues that she was advocating,"" Padilla said. Houston police on Monday announced they have doubled the reward from $5,000 to $10,000 for any information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person responsible for Bagherzadeh's death. The night she was killed, she was driving to the condominium she shared with her parents not far from downtown Houston, according to police.  It was about 11:45 p.m. and, investigators said, she was on her cell phone with an ex-boyfriend. Police said the boyfriend heard a scream followed by tires screeching and then silence.   She was found slumped over the steering wheel, the tires of the car still spinning because it had crashed into a garage in a nearby condominium complex.   The ex-boyfriend, according to police, is not considered a suspect. Members of the Sabz dissident group wondered why Iran might target Bagherzadeh, particularly because ""there are many more important opposition leaders"" in the United States, according to group member Seth Eslami. ""There are groups who have their own TV stations, groups who lobby in Washington, D.C., groups who actually plot in Iran to do different things.  Not us,"" Eslami said.  ""Why us?"" Two years ago, CNN reported on what local police in Glendora, California, said was Iranian involvement in the attempted assassination of an Iranian dissident radio broadcaster.  Since then, the United States has formally accused Iran of being behind a plot to kill the Saudi Arabian ambassador to the United States. Fred Burton, a senior vice president of a private security analytical firm, Stratfor Global Intelligence, said Iranian intelligence services work in secretive ways, with motives that aren't always clear. Burton, a former State Department expert on counterterrorism, said the fact that the victim lived in Paris and traveled widely in Europe could have made her far more important to Iranian intelligence than her dissident activities in the United States. ""You have a 30-year-old woman who's spent time out of Iran, in Paris for example,"" he said,  ""What has she been doing?  Was she more active overseas, for example, than we understand here?  The Iranian intelligence service has a very strong network, a very strong collection network in Paris specifically.  They are trying to keep tabs on their dissidents."" Houston police said they are stuck and will follow any lead, even those involving Iranian conspiracies, if it will lead them to the killer.","Iranian dissident Gelareh Bagherzadeh, 30, was shot and killed in January .

"More than five years after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and the beginning of the most severe economic downturn since the Great Depression, lawmakers should ask themselves whether they have done enough to reduce the risk of another financial crisis. In our view, the answer is no. The chances of another financial crisis will remain unacceptably high as long as there are financial institutions that are ""too big to fail"" -- entities that are deemed so important to the overall health and functioning of the markets that their collapse would bring down the entire financial system. But over five years after the crash, the big banks are more concentrated and more interconnected and their appetite for excessively risky behavior is unchanged. The biggest banks are substantially bigger than they were in 2008. In fact, the five biggest banks now control more than half the nation's total banking assets. Despite a marked increase in banks' overall stability since 2008, the risk of systemic failure continues to exist. In 2012, JPMorgan Chase suffered a $6.2 billion loss because of the so-called ""London Whale"" trades. The bank's senior management, board of directors, and internal risk controls failed to stem the rapidly expanding losses. In its settlement with federal regulators, the bank admitted wrongdoing and acknowledged that there were severe problems with its internal controls. That episode was yet another reminder that banks continue to engage in risky conduct and that regulators continue to lack the tools and willingness to stop such conduct before it happens. That's why we co-sponsored the 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act. The Act, which we first introduced a year ago last week, would separate traditional banks that offer checking and savings accounts from riskier financial services, such as investment banking and swaps dealing. It would encourage financial institutions to shrink to manageable sizes and eliminate their ability to rely on federal depository insurance as a backstop for high-risk activities. It would make banks smaller and less complex. This proactive, structural approach to reducing bank risk should be far preferable to risk-management through over-regulation. Although a new Glass-Steagall Act would not resolve the ""too big to fail"" problem entirely, reinstating and strengthening the wall between federally insured commercial banks and investment banks would discourage the largest financial institutions from exploiting regulatory loopholes in order to take excessive risks at taxpayer expense. Congress should not wait until the next crisis to address the ""too big to fail"" problem. Nor should it wait any longer in the hopes that regulators will end this phenomenon themselves.  It's been four years since Congress passed, and rulemaking began on, the Dodd-Frank Act. The regulators have so far missed more than half of their statutory rule-making deadlines and many rules remain unwritten. Congress must step in. We owe the American people as much. The real cost of the financial crisis was borne, and is still being borne, by the men, women, families, small businesses, and communities in America -- American taxpayers. A report by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas estimated that the financial crisis cost us as much as $14 trillion. That's $120,000 for every American household -- more than two years' worth of income for the average family. The big Wall Street banks continue to hum along as they did before the crisis -- too big to fail and, in many cases, potentially exposing the economy to the risk of systemic failure. That would, needless to say, be devastating. Which leads to the last question lawmakers should ask themselves:  More than five years later, with another financial crisis a very real possibility, why isn't this a more urgent issue?  We urge our colleagues to support our bill.","Senators: We still have banks that are ""too big to fail,"" threatening another crash .
Senators want updated Glass-Steagall Act to scale back huge financial institutions .
They say new act would separate traditional banks from riskier financial services .

"Khartoum, Sudan -- A YouTube video of Sudanese police officers laughing as they publicly flogged a pleading, fleeing woman has sparked outrage, prompting dozens of demonstrators to protest Tuesday outside the Justice Ministry in downtown Khartoum, authorities said. The demonstrators belonged to the Women Initiative Against Violence, and 52 of them -- 46 women and six men -- were arrested for unlawful assembly, the Khartoum State Police Force said in a statement. All 52 persons were released under bail, police said. The two-minute video has caused an uproar in Sudan, and columnists in pro-government newspapers have called for an immediate investigation. Much criticism focuses on how the flogging was carried out. The footage shows an unidentified woman in a head scarf and black abaya, or Islamic robe, and she's ordered in Arabic to sit down in a parking lot and take her punishment so that the officers ""can go home."" The flogging is initially to her back, in keeping with the Sharia code, or Islamic law, governing flogging, but when she turns to ask for mercy, the whipping continues to the front part of her body, including her face, hands and legs. A shocked passerby can be heard exclaiming, ""There is no authority but God's"" after witnessing the woman's punishment. One of the officers responds: ""This is a fundamental principle. Let him whip her."" At another point, an officer laughs when he realizes he is being filmed and asks the person behind the camera to film spectators whom he says are laughing with him. That officer then joins the flogging, and the woman is whipped by the two male officers. Sudan's deputy police chief, Adel Al-Agib, initially attempted to downplay the incident and told the government's official news agency that the video was circulated to ""damage the image of the country."" In a recent meeting organized by the Sudanese Journalism and Publications Council, Al-Agib said the video was recorded in July 2009, but was recently released ""to coincide with International Human Rights Day in order to bring on more international pressure on the country,"" he said. On late Sunday, Sudan's Judiciary Authority, which oversees the legal system, announced it had launched an inquiry to see if the punishment had been administered improperly. The authority said nothing about the punishment itself. The judiciary authority said it would investigate the manner in which the ""execution of a punishment went against legally established guidelines according to criminal publications."" ""The investigation was started immediately after the images of the young woman, being punished under Articles 154 and 155 of the 1991 Sudanese penal code, appeared on the internet,"" the judiciary said in the statement. Article 154 deals with the ""practice of prostitution,"" and Article 155 deals with the ""management of a place of prostitution."" Details of the woman's purported offenses have not been released by authorities. Local news accounts have reported that the flogging took place in Omdurman, Khartoum's twin city across the river, at the Kajabab Police Station, which is in a poor neighborhood notorious for brothels and the illegal sale of the local moonshine ""aragi."" Flogging is common in northern Sudan, where Islamic law is often enforced arbitrarily under the Public Order Act. Police and ""public order units"" have powers to enforce what is inappropriate dress or behavior. Local human rights organizations have long accused police of abusing their authority to mistreat women. Last year, Lubna Hussein, a former journalist turned United Nations employee, was arrested with a dozen other women for wearing trousers. Lubna was found guilty but was fined rather than whipped. Her case garnered international attention. The Public Order Act also applies to men. Last week a Khartoum court convicted seven men of indecency after they wore make-up while appearing at the ""Sudanese Next Top Model fashion show."" The men were fined 200 Sudanese pounds, or $60, each. CNN's Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","A YouTube video depicts police officers laughing as they flog a crying woman .

"Just over half the public says that it's bad for the country that the GOP controls the House of Representatives, according to a new national poll conducted after the end of the partial government shutdown. And the CNN/ORC International survey also indicates that more than six in 10 Americans say that Speaker of the House John Boehner should be replaced. The poll was conducted Friday through Sunday, just after the end of the 16-day partial federal government shutdown that was caused in part by a push by House conservatives to try and dismantle the health care law, which is President Barack Obama's signature domestic achievement. Full poll results (pdf) According to the survey, 54% say it's a bad thing that the GOP controls the House, up 11 points from last December, soon after the 2012 elections when the Republicans kept control of the chamber. Only 38% say it's a good thing the GOP controls the House, a 13-point dive from the end of last year. Defeated GOP wants to unite and fight another day . This is the first time since the Republicans won back control of the House in the 2010 midterm elections that a majority say their control of the chamber is bad for the country. CNN Chief National Correspondent John King said there is time for Republicans to recover before the 2014 midterms. ""The midterm election is a year away. There's plenty of time for Republicans to work on the brand, but they've taken a bit of a beating here. They've got some work to do. They need a bit of a makeover,"" King said. Majority want Boehner out . ""We fought the good fight. We just didn't win,"" Boehner said at the end of the shutdown. And while he received a standing ovation at a closed gathering of House Republicans as the crisis came to a close, he may not see anything to applaud in the new poll. ""John Boehner fares just as badly as the GOP,"" CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said. ""Sixty-three percent of all Americans think that Boehner should be replaced as Speaker of the House, a view shared by roughly half of all Republicans."" Fleischer: Shutdown deal is a 15-yard punt . According to the poll, only 30% of the public says Boehner, who became Speaker in January 2011, should continue in that role. Congress near historic lows . The survey indicates that the approval rating for Congress remains near an all-time low. Only 12% of those questioned say they approve of the job Congress is doing, just two points higher than the historic low in CNN polling. And 86% give federal lawmakers a thumbs-down, also near the all-time high. Forty-four percent say they approve of the job the President is doing with 52% saying they disapprove. Four things we learned from government shutdown . ""Barack Obama's numbers are pretty anemic, but he remains in much better shape than the GOP,"" Holland said. ""Even though Obama's approval rating remains stuck in the mid-40s, it didn't take a hit during the shutdown -- 44% just before the shutdown began; 44% now."" According to the survey, 44% also say they have more confidence in Obama rather than the GOP in Congress to deal with the major issues facing the country today, a 5-point drop from last year; 31% say they have more confidence in congressional Republicans, unchanged from last December. Obama wants new approach after shutdown . ""The biggest change on that question is the 21% who volunteer that they don't have confidence in either side -- a remarkably high number that is roughly double its usual level,"" Holland said. Majority favor health care law or say it doesn't go far enough . Even though they lost this round, conservatives vow to continue their fight to dismantle Obamacare. And they point to major troubles with the rollout of the website where Americans without insurance can enroll in the new health care exchanges. The president addressed the debacle at an event Monday at the White House, saying there was no way to sugarcoat the issues that applicants have experienced. According to the poll, just more than four in 10 say they favor the law, with 56% opposed to it.

"(CNN) -- Iran's military is working to exponentially boost the range and numbers of its radar systems as part of a series of stepped-up defense measures, state-run media reports. Brig. Gen. Ahmad Miqani, commander of the Khatam ol-Anbia Air Defense Base, said Sunday that Iran is working on a radar system to detect low-altitude objects as far as 3,000 km (1,864 miles) away, according to Iran's semi-official Fars News Agency. Previously, the maximum range for Iranian radar was 400 km (250 miles), he said. ""Today, we are building all types of active or passive radar systems, with any kind of range and in any frequency,"" Miqani said, according to Fars. The latest public comments touting its upgraded military capabilities come days after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Iran the biggest threat to his country and the world, in a speech to a major Jewish organization. Starting Tuesday, Iran's military will hold five days of air defense drills to assess the effectiveness of its missile defense and weapons systems, Miqani said, according to state-run Press TV. During the drills, which were described as an annual exercise, Iranian forces will fend off ""mock enemy"" aircraft and missiles, the report said. Besides the new and upgraded radar, all of which will be produced domestically, Iran is also making progress in updating its missile defense systems, according to the Fars report. Miqani said that the military has finished the design stage of its long-range air missile defense system. Iran, too, expects to double the range of its low-altitude Mersad air defense system, he added Sunday. These announcements come a month after the national defense ministry said Iran had successfully expanded the range of its mid-range Mersad missile defense system. Iranian Defense Minister Ahmad Vahidi said earlier this year that Iran's radar systems can now detect any air-borne target, the Fars report said. ""Today, we own sea-based and ground-based radars, as well as radars (that) are capable of identifying multiple air targets in various frequencies and different altitudes,"" Vahidi said.","Iran is developing a radar with a range of 1,864 miles, state-run media reports .

"A cache of weapons seized from a ship off the coast of Yemen had markings that indicate they came from Iran, a U.S. official said Tuesday. The markings on those weapons -- which included surface-to-air missiles, potent explosives and rocket-propelled grenades -- indicate they came from Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps facilities, said the official, who declined to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the information. The weapons were believed to be headed for Shiite Muslim insurgents in Yemen, the official told CNN. The country's government has fought periodic battles against the Houthis, a Shiite rebel movement in northern Yemen, in a conflict seen as both separatist and sectarian. Yemen accused Shiite-majority Iran of supporting the Houthis during their last major revolt, in 2009, which saw Sunni-led Saudi Arabia launching airstrikes against suspected Houthis on its side of the border. Iran denied the allegations and criticized the Saudi strikes. Yemen's government announced the arms seizure on Monday, saying the ship had been boarded in Yemeni territorial waters in the Arabian Sea on January 23. The American destroyer USS Farragut was working with Yemeni authorities when they spotted the vessel in question, an Obama administration official said Monday. The ship had several flags onboard, but no reliable documentation showing where it came from, the official added. The firepower included anti-aircraft missiles, C4 military-grade explosives, ammunition and bomb-making equipment such as circuits, remote triggers and various handheld explosives, the Yemenis said. The vessel carried a crew of eight Yemenis, they said. The Obama administration official described the seizure as a joint operation, and said U.S. forces joined their Yemeni counterparts in boarding the suspect boat.","The weapons may have been headed for Yemeni Shiite rebels, a U.S. official says .

"The White House on Wednesday dismissed an Iranian threat to deploy warships near the U.S. coast, and military experts said Iran lacks the naval capability to do so. Overnight Tuesday, Iranian state news quoted a commander as saying his country plans to have a ""powerful presence"" near the U.S. border. In response, White House spokesman Jay Carney said that ""we don't take these statements seriously, given that they do not reflect at all Iran's naval capabilities."" Pentagon spokesman George Little echoed Carney's point, saying Iran has the right to send vessels into international waters, but ""whether they can truly project naval power beyond the region is another question."" ""I wouldn't read too much into what came out of Iran today,"" Little said, adding: ""I think what is said and what is actually done can be two different things."" State-run Press TV in Iran said similar plans were announced in July. However, no Iranian warships ever deployed. In February, two Iranian navy vessels traversed the Suez Canal in the first such voyage by Iranian ships since 1979. Richard Herrmann, director of the Mershon Center for International Security Studies at The Ohio State University, said Iran's navy is too small with too miniscule a budget to remain for long off the U.S. coast. ""This is hard to take seriously, because Iran's navy is very small. This force, whatever it may be, is going to be puny, especially compared to the U.S. Navy,"" said Herrmann, who specializes in the use of imagery and posturing in international conflicts. ""Iran doesn't have the capability to come within close proximity to (the United States) to conduct hostile activities. Even if (Iran) launched missiles, we would sink their ships immediately."" Iran lacks battleships or aircraft carriers. Its forces are capable of patrolling the Persian Gulf and sailing a short distance in the Indian Ocean, Herrmann said, but keeping ships stationed near the United States, so far from Iran, would be too expensive for the government. ""They would need a place to resupply, refuel, restock crews with food and water. They couldn't afford that unless they got help,"" Herrmann said.  ""I would imagine they could get help from somewhere in South America, maybe Venezuela."" Venezuela and Iran are allied by their anti-U.S. sentiments. Michael Connell, the director of the Iranian studies program at CNA, a Washington-area think tank that specializes in naval analyses, agreed with Herrmann. ""Their navy can't reach our coastline right now,"" Connell said, describing the Iranian announcement as ""bombastic rhetoric."" ""It's posturing"" by Iran intended for both its domestic and regional audience, Connell said. Making such pronouncements projects a dominant role including naval power, whether or not they can back it up, he added. ""The Iranians have been historically annoyed that we have a naval presence in the Persian Gulf, which is kind of their backyard,"" Connell said. The worst move the United States could make now would be to overreact, said John Mueller, the Woody Hayes chair of national security studies at Mershon. ""Hopefully this won't play into (American) neo-cons who are itching for a war with Iran,"" he said. ""The best thing to do is ignore it and treat it with the contempt it deserves. If Iran wants to waste their time and money on a dwindling supply of fuel (to keep ships) bobbing around in the Atlantic Ocean, then let them."" The idea of Iran moving ships near the U.S. coast is not on par with the Soviet Union flying planes off the coast of Alaska during the Cold War, Mueller noted. The Soviets' move was legal, and was considered a gesture intended to irritate the United States, he said. ""Those were different circumstances and different players,"" Mueller added. Herrmann cautioned that while moving ships near the U.S. coast may not be a real threat, Iran is certainly capable of harming the United States -- but closer to Iran. Iran could attack U.S. ships in the Strait of Hormuz, a waterway between the Gulf of Oman and the Persian Gulf, on the south coast of Iran. Such attacks could disrupt oil markets and scare American tourists, Herrmann said.","The White House says it doesn't take the Iranian claim seriously .

"(CNN) -- The flood-engorged Susquehanna River was beginning to crest late Thursday in some Pennsylvania and New York cities, while other communities braced for still higher water levels. Thousands evacuated their homes as the remnants of Tropical Storm Lee moved across already sodden portions of the Northeast, triggering near-historic flooding and leaving at least three people dead. In Luzerne County, in the northeastern part of Pennsylvania, between 65,000 and 70,000 people were ordered to leave their homes as the Susquehanna rose above flood stage, according to Emergency Management Coordinator Stephen Bekanich. The levee system was holding late Thursday in Wilkes-Barre, the county seat, a few hours before the river was to crest. As of 9:45 p.m. ET Thursday, the Susquehanna was at 38.83 feet at Wilkes-Barre. Flood stage is 22 feet, according to the National Weather Service.The valley has a levee system that tops out at 41 feet, and the river was projected to crest just shy of that Friday morning, near 40.7 feet, according to Drew McLaughlin, a spokesman for the Wilkes-Barre mayor's office. McLaughlin and other officials were examining the levees. ""We're closely monitoring, and it seems they are holding steady,"" he said. A river gate near the Market Street Bridge was leaking late Thursday, but sandbags and other repairs were keeping it in check, with some minor street flooding in the area, according to McLaughlin. ""It's pretty much a ghost town,"" McLaughlin said from south downtown, adding that residents appeared to heed the call to leave. Other Luzerne County communities not protected by the system were not so fortunate. Heavy flooding was reported in West Pittston, Harding and Plymouth Township. ""At this point, we haven't been able to assess that (flooding and damage) because the water is so high,"" Bekanich said. Plymouth Township resident Francis Federici was forced to leave his home, which sat in 5-foot floodwaters. ""On a normal day, we love it here,"" he said. ""There's nobody around us. We have a beautiful yard. We were fixing our home up."" ""The rise of the river is so tremendous, we put out a request to volunteers to assist in sandbagging operations,"" Bekanich said. ""We're getting more and more alarmed as the day progresses,"" said Luzerne County Commissioner Maryanne Petrilla, who said the river is now forecast to crest between midnight Thursday and 2 a.m. Friday. Shelter space for 4,100 was rapidly being filled, and the county was looking for more space, Petrilla told CNN. The area from Ithaca to Syracuse to Utica, in New York, and from Wilkes-Barre, Scranton, to Monticello, in Pennsylvania, continued to experience major to record flooding, CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen said. A 71-year-old man died Wednesday night in Derry Township, Pennsylvania, as he was bailing water out of the basement of his home and the walls of the structure caved in, said Chief Patrick O'Rourke of Derry Township Police. A second person drowned early Thursday near Brickerville in Lancaster County, CNN affiliate WGAL-TV reported. A third person died about 4:30 a.m. Thursday in North Lebanon Township, Pennsylvania, police said. A motorist became stranded in high water and was outside the vehicle when struck by another vehicle, which then left the scene. The suspect and that vehicle were found, authorities said. Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania, had received an incredible 15.37 inches of rainfall associated with Lee. P&J Pizza, which escaped flooding, did a brisk business Thursday because so many residents couldn't use their kitchens, said employee Sarah Bellia. Many recalled the flooding caused by Hurricane Agnes in 1972. That storm dumped as much as 18 inches of rain on the area in two days, destroying more than 68,000 homes and 3,000 businesses and leaving 220,000 Pennsylvanians homeless. In Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania, CNN iReporter Nick Bohacz said flooded roads prevented him from getting to work. Bohacz, who sent in several photos of the flooding, said he saw a line of people outside a hardware store waiting for supplies. Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and other towns won't see a river crest until later Friday. The rising Susquehanna and Chenango rivers were also triggering evacuations in upstate New York, where evacuation orders were issued for portions of Binghamton and the towns of Conklin, Endicott, Johnson City, Union and Vestal, according to CNN affiliate YNN-TV. Numerous cities and counties declared a state of emergency. Video from Johnson City showed a flooded shopping mall and a football field with water nearly up to its goalposts. ""This is a major flooding situation,"" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said at a news conference. ""This is nothing to trifle with."" He said he believes flooding will reach historic levels. ""By the time it looks that bad, you won't be able to leave,"" he said. Water was coming over the floodwalls in Binghamton, county spokeswoman Colleen Wagner said. About 15,000 people were ordered to evacuate, and about 1,400 were in shelters, she said. State officials sent in food and water. A number of boat rescues have taken place, she said, but she did not know how many. The Susquehanna later Thursday crested at 25.71 feet. Broome County Emergency Services Director Brett Chellis urged people in the evacuation areas to leave and not return for now. Water was topping flood walls in Union and Vestal as well as Binghamton, he said. In Otego, New York, about 50 miles northeast of Binghamton, CNN iReporter Don Wyckoff captured footage of water cascading down a road. Wyckoff said he was stunned after watching neighbors and family members lose their homes to the floodwaters. ""You are seeing the tiny mill creek rip out culvert pipes and tearing away roads,"" he said. ""We never thought we would see this again. It happened in 2006, but it is worse now."" In Oneonta, on the Susquehanna upstream of Binghamton, Police Chief Gary O'Neill said some roads were washed out and parks flooded, but the water appeared to be receding. On the down side, water was flooding the chief's home in Binghamton. Mandatory evacuations were also in place for low-lying areas near Schenectady, New York, YNN said. In neighboring Montgomery County, authorities closed all roads and county buildings until further notice, saying only emergency vehicles would be allowed to travel. The New York State Thruway Authority opened and closed several roads and ramps. In Maryland, areas near Baltimore were also affected. High water blocked dozens of roads in Baltimore County, according to CNN affiliate WMAR-TV. In Anne Arundel County, Maryland, crews found a 49-year-old man in floodwaters, CNN affiliate WBL reported. The man died at a hospital. The circumstances of his death were not clear Thursday evening. Port Deposit, Maryland, about 45 miles northeast of Baltimore along the Susquehanna, ordered an evacuation of the town's 800 residents by 8 p.m. Thursday. The Prince George's County, Maryland, Fire and EMS Department said it was responding to numerous emergency calls, and nearly two dozen people had been rescued or helped by firefighters and the department's swift-water team. Because the system is slow-moving, ""I'm afraid it's going to get worse before it gets better,"" CNN meteorologist Rob Marciano said. Several rounds of heavy rain are in store for much of the region the next couple of days, with an additional 2 to 6 inches forecast -- and in isolated cases as much as 10 inches, according to the National Weather Service. The rain comes on top of the heavy precipitation that has fallen in the region from Irene. What's left of Lee has stalled across the central Appalachian Mountains. Rainfall totals through 2 p.m. Thursday included 11.66 inches in Waldorf, Maryland; 8.23 inches at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland; 9.55 inches in Phillipsburg, New Jersey; 10.08 inches in Binghamton; 14.7 inches in Pine Grove, Pennsylvania; 13.3 inches in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, according to the National Weather Service's Hydrometeorological Prediction Center. CNN's Sarah Dillingham, Ines Ferre, Mary Snow, Scott Thompson and Jesse Solomon contributed to this report.","Susquehanna River begins to crest in Pennsylvania, New York state .

"(CNN) -- Following the preliminary hearing of a Georgia father accused of allowing his child to die in a hot car, most legal experts agree that the prosecution will likely upgrade the charges to malice murder after the case is presented to a grand jury. For now, until those charges are upgraded, Justin Ross Harris is charged with felony murder, perhaps the most widely criticized legal construct in American jurisprudence. To many legal scholars, the felony murder rule is logically and morally indefensible. To many members of the law-and-order public, the ends of the felony murder rule justify the means. And in Georgia it is liberally employed. It offers an end run around the very difficult standard of proof to find a killing was intentional. First, let's define murder. Most Americans have a working definition of murder, formed not only by what they've gleaned about the law, but also their personal morality. Murder is generally understood to be an intentional killing, without justification. There are subcategories of intentional murder: For example, killing by poison, torture, or ambush are considered worse; these show intent and take a more prolonged period. In addition to intentional killings, those resulting from incredibly reckless behavior qualify for murder, too. It makes sense: If someone shoots a gun into a crowd of people, someone is highly likely to die -- even though the defendant could truthfully say he didn't actually aim for the victim. It's important to remember that this kind of murder is not defined simply by the stupidity of the actions -- the defendant must have been aware of the risk, and have acted with a depraved indifference to human life. These are two main kinds of murder. One is intentional, and the other involves behavior so indifferent to human life and so close to intentional that it might as well have been. Those definitions make sense. But then there's felony murder. Call it what you will, but the ""felony murder rule"" is murder in name only. In fact, it's a first-degree murder charge for an admittedly unintentional killing. More specifically, it's a killing that happens during the commission of an inherently dangerous felony. With this definition, the policy behind the felony murder rule becomes immediately apparent: deterrence. The rule sends a powerful message to would-be felons: burglary, arson, rape, robbery, and kidnapping are so dangerous that a defendant should know that an innocent person is likely to die. If you intend to rob a bank, then you know a bank teller might die. Therefore, you, too, should be charged with murder, along with that robbery -- even if you were driving the getaway car and not the one who pulled the trigger. To felony murder supporters, it doesn't matter that a defendant is charged with murder, even a defendant they know didn't actually kill anyone and who didn't want anyone to die. To them, the ends of the felony murder rule justify the means: If you don't want to catch a murder case, don't rob banks. It's the cases like Justin Ross Harris that really test the morality of the rule, while exposing some logical problems with its application. Georgia has a very broad felony murder statute: The only limitation on the type of underlying felony for a felony murder conviction is that the crime must be ""inherently dangerous to human life."" Also in Georgia, a conviction for felony murder may be predicated on second degree child cruelty, which qualifies as that ""inherently dangerous felony."" That's what has happened so far in this case. The prosecution has charged Harris with second degree child cruelty, and used that charge as the predicate felony for the murder charge. There's just one problem: The second degree cruelty charge is a negligence crime. That means Harris is charged with murder using a felony charge that is an unintentional crime. In other words, Georgia reserves the charge of murder for the most intentional, depraved conduct, but if you do something unintentional but negligent, that can be a qualifying felony. So, charging Harris with felony murder predicated on child neglect was a brilliant strategic move by the prosecutors. Proving a specific intent to kill in this case will be more difficult than proving mere carelessness in parenting. And if both are murder, then there's no reason to charge the more difficult crime to prove. Key role of digital evidence . Of course, at the preliminary hearing, you'd never know that the charge was negligence, because we heard ample evidence of malicious intent. The defense attorney made a reasoned argument that the prosecution's state-of-mind evidence was thinly disguised, improper character evidence, but the judge sided with the prosecution and allowed this damning evidence in against Harris. The sexting, the life insurance policy, the Internet searches, had nothing to do with Harris' alleged negligence -- remember, right now, negligence is the only basis of the felony murder charge. It's as if the prosecution put on a hearing for a specific intent crime, malice murder, that hasn't been charged yet. That's why the preliminary hearing was just a harbinger of things to come. Why put on evidence of so much malice if it wasn't really germane to a charge of neglect? Because we'll probably see upgraded charges in the near future, once this case goes to a grand jury. It's very likely that the felony murder charges will only be a short chapter in the prosecution of Justin Ross Harris. However, they present an opportunity to open a debate traditionally reserved for legal scholars and philosophers: Is felony murder an unfair legal fiction that overly punishes people for unintentional killings? Or, is the overall message to would-be felons worth ignoring the logical inconsistencies of the felony murder rule? In law, as in many things, legal minds can differ on whether the ends justify the means.","Danny Cevallos: Justin Ross Harris charged with felony murder, a controversial charge .

"An estimated 7 million people died due to air pollution globally in 2012, with more than half of the deaths linked to indoor smoke from cook stoves, according to a report by the World Health Organization. Air pollution is now the ""single largest environmental health risk,"" the U.N. health agency stated in the report. The majority of the deaths associated with air pollution were heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer. ""Few risks have greater impact on global health today than air pollution: the evidence signals the need for concerted action to clean up the air we all breathe,"" said Dr. Maria Neira, director of WHO's Department for Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants of Health in the report. The Western Pacific (which includes east Asia and the Pacific islands)and the Southeast Asian regions were estimated to be the hardest-hit, according to the report, with 2.8 million and 2.3 million deaths as a result of polluted air in 2012. In the Southeast Asian region, the bulk of it, with 1.7 million premature deaths, was attributed to indoor air pollution. Around 3 billion people in the world rely on coal, wood and open-air fires for household cooking, according to the WHO's estimates. In India, 63% of the population uses such solid fuels for cooking. These fuels produce harmful pollutants such as fine particulate matter and carbon monoxide. Country-specific data was not yet available in the report. The WHO findings further noted that women in developing countries are more exposed to household air pollution than men. ""Poor women and children pay a hefty price from indoor air pollution since they spend more time at home breathing in smoke and soot from leaky coal and wood cook stoves,"" said Dr. Flavia Bustreo, WHO assistant director of General Family, Women and Child's Health in the report. Meanwhile, outdoor air pollution killed an estimated 3.7 million people, with more than 80% of the deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries. The sources for ambient pollution include diesel engines and industrial emissions. Sixty percent of these deaths were due to cardiovascular diseases like stroke and heart disease.

"Officials in Washington said Monday they would grant consular access to the U.S.-held suspect in an alleged Iranian plot to assassinate the Saudi Arabian ambassador to the United States. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said officials do not believe the suspect, Manssor Arbabsia, 56, is entitled to consular visits because he is a dual U.S.-Iranian citizen. But the agency has long encouraged authorities to allow consular visits in such cases and would do so this time, he said. Earlier, a senior administration official said Monday the United States will grant access if Iran formally requests it. The Iranian Foreign Ministry posted a statement to its website Sunday saying that it had given a note demanding access to Arbabsia. but Toner said that it did not appear that the request had been received yet. U.S. officials arrested Arbabsia last week on suspicion that he conspired with an Iran-based member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps to hire hit men from a Mexican drug cartel to set off a bomb next year at a restaurant to be visited by Adel Al-Jubeir, the Saudi ambassador. The Iranian Foreign Ministry said the accusations were baseless and called for access to the suspect. ""Iran's Foreign Ministry reiterated that any delay by the United States in facilitating consular contact with the Iranian national would be contrary to the logic of international law and the United States' obligations,"" the Foreign Ministry said. The United States alleges individuals in the Iranian government knew about the plot. Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi has said Iran is willing to look at evidence in the plot. ""We are prepared to consider any issue, even if it is falsely created, with patience. We have asked the Unites States to provide us with the relevant information regarding this scenario,"" he told the Islamic Republic News Agency. The State Department said last week there had been direct contact with Iran about the alleged plot, but a senior Iranian official denied it. Two State Department officials said Susan Rice, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, met with Mohammad Khazaee, Iran's permanent representative to the United Nations. But the Iranian mission in New York denied it. ""There were no kinds of negotiations between the two countries, and there was not such a contact,"" said Alireza Miryousefi, press secretary for the Iranian Mission to the United Nations. Salehi said Monday the American allegations were aimed at creating discord between states in the region. And he asserted that Iran had never been involved in terrorist operations, the Islamic Republic News Agency said. Salehi's apparent willingness to look at evidence of the plot comes in stark contrast to the response of the country's supreme leader. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called the allegations  ""meaningless and absurd"" in his first public reaction to alleged plot. ""They (the U.S.) want to isolate Iran,"" Khamenei said over chants of ""Down with America"" in a speech Saturday before thousands in Gilangharb, Iran. The alleged scheme involved a connection to the Quds Force, a branch of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard, which formally answers to Khamenei. Gholam Shakuri, an Iran-based member of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, is also accused in the alleged hit. Authorities developed the case against the suspects with the help of an undercover informant posing as an associate of a Mexican drug cartel, according to officials and an FBI agent's affidavit. Reza Aslan, a religious scholar and author, told CNN on Saturday that the described plot doesn't fit the Quds Force's modus operandi. Using a drug cartel would be risky and a Quds Force agent would be more reliable than Arbabsiar, a used-car salesman in Texas, he said. ""It's sloppy. It's uncharacteristic,"" Aslan said. ""It really does not serve Iran's interest in any legitimate way."" Iran could more easily target Saudi diplomats in the Middle East, Africa and elsewhere, Aslan said. ""Doing so on U.S. soil is unmistakably an attack on the United States, not on Saudi Arabia.""","U.S. will grant access to suspect if requested, State Department spokesman says .

"Ideally, Casey St. Clair would be spending Thanksgiving relaxing and eating dinner with her boyfriend and his family. Instead, the part-time Target employee and substitute teacher will work next Thursday night during the early kickoff of the big-box retailer's Black Friday sale. Stores will open at 9 p.m. on Thanksgiving this year, reflecting a wider shift in the retail industry toward getting a head start on the biggest shopping day of the year. Wal-Mart workers plan Black Friday walkout . As it stands now, Toys R Us, Wal-Mart, Sears and KMart will be the first large retail chains to open their doors for bargain hunters at 8 p.m. Many other chains are open Thanksgiving Day, but their Black Friday sales don't start until midnight or Friday morning. St. Clair, who lives in Corona, California, is scheduled to work Wednesday from 7 p.m. to 3 a.m. She'll return Thanksgiving Day before 9 p.m. and work until 5:15 on Friday morning. She has to sleep at some point, so traveling 45 minutes each way for Thanksgiving dinner is out. ""It shouldn't have to be a rushed affair, slipping in to eat some turkey and taking a piece of pie for the road,"" said St. Clair, who plans to have dinner at home with her boyfriend before going to work. What's your Black Friday strategy? She likes working for Target, which is why she has stayed with the company for six years, even after relocating from the East Coast in 2011, she said. She is also grateful to have a job that pays time and a half plus bonus pay for overnight hours, even if it means she can't fly home to her own family for the holidays. But after watching Black Friday sales start earlier each year, she decided the company had gone too far this time and started a Change.org petition asking Target CEO Gregg W. Steinhafel to forgo the plan to open stores on Thanksgiving. ""It's one of few days retail employees get to spend with their families, but at this point there's no time to see family,"" St. Clair said in a phone interview. ""My main issue is not with people wanting to shop; they can do that still, though I think that they can hold off until Friday without the world crashing down,"" she said. ""My issue is that Target and other retailers have done something they have never done before in opening on Thanksgiving. My anger is aimed at the loss of a day that, up until now, was considered important enough for only the most essential services to be open."" Why it sucks to work Black Friday . She's not the only one who thinks the ""Black Friday creep"" hurts employees and their families, with some taking action. A group of Wal-Mart workers are planning to strike at about 1,000 stores on Black Friday. More than 40 petitions have been launched on Change.org asking retailers including Sears, Target, Walmart and Kohl's to ""give Thanksgiving back to families."" Many of them popped up after St. Clair's appeared Friday, earning more than 200,000 signatures as of Wednesday. When it started earning traction, Change.org promoted the petition among users, but even before then it had taken on a life of its own, site spokeswoman Charlotte Hill said. ""Employees and customers alike are saying, 'Thanksgiving should be about celebrating with family, not shopping for the latest deals,' "" Hill said. Comments on the petitions echo that sentiment, with some threatening to boycott stores that they say put revenue before employees. ""I'm a conscious consumer; I think of good reasons to shop where I do, and consider why and why not to give any store my money. Seeing this happen year after year to the employees of Target irks me, and makes me want to ... take my money elsewhere,"" one user said. Other comments in petitions against Target and other retailers focused on the importance of letting employees spend time with family. ""After 33 years in retail, I still love everything about the holidays....except telling some poor employee she has to forgo her family holiday because she has to work! We really have to put a limit on the madness!"" said a person who signed a petition titled, ""Retailers: Stop Black Thursday."" ""Families should come before retail sales! Give these people the day off that they deserve,"" said another person who signed the petition ""Wal-Mart: Move Black Friday Start Back to Friday."" Relatives of retail employees are also speaking out. The sister of a Target employee in Illinois started a petition on behalf of her family, claiming that for them, Thanksgiving will ""not be complete"" without him. ""Family has always been important to me and Thanksgiving is all about family,"" Jennifer Ann said in her petition, ""Target: Don't take away Thanksgiving."" She asked to withhold her last name in deference to her brother, who asked to conceal his identity. Last year, it was hard for her 24-year-old brother, who has worked for Target since high school, to relax knowing he had to be at work, she said in an interview with sister network HLN. He rushed through dinner and had to leave for his shift just as everyone was starting to unwind. This year, he's going to miss dinner altogether, she said. ""It's just unfortunate that he has to be at work when we're celebrating,"" she said. ""I get that you sign up for things like this. (But) you don't typically have to work on Thanksgiving when you work in retail, and this is something that's kind of gradually happened."" Target and other big-box retailers say they're responding to consumer demands as best they can -- with employees in mind. ""Target's opening time was carefully evaluated with our guests, team and the business in mind. Across the country, team member preferences were considered in creating our store staffing schedules,"" said spokeswoman Molly Snyder. ""Thanksgiving weekend is one of the busiest of the year, and we appreciate our Target team's flexibility on this weekend and throughout the holiday season."" All hourly employees who work on a national holiday, including Thanksgiving, receive pay equal to time and a half their hourly pay rate, she said. Additionally, team members who work certain hours on Thanksgiving and Friday will receive shift differential pay and holiday premium pay. Walmart also was named in several petitions, though most of its stores are open 24 hours and 365 days a year, including Thanksgiving. Last year, customer traffic was highest during the 10 p.m. hour on Thanksgiving, a spokesman said . ""We appreciate our associates for everything they do to serve our customers during this busy shopping season and every day throughout the year,"" spokesman Steve Restivo said in an e-mail. ""According to the National Retail Federation, Thanksgiving night shopping has surged over the past three years. Most of our stores are open 24 hours and, historically, much of our Black Friday preparations have been done on Thanksgiving, which is not unusual in the retail industry."" Ultimately, the power is in the hands of consumers to drive down the demand for extended shopping hours, retail and employment experts agreed. Labor Day and Memorial Day used to be days of rest, too, said Rich Milgram, CEO of career network Beyond.com, which connects employers and job seekers. But now, sales on those days are the norm, showing that over time, society grows accustomed to changes and demands of the free market. ""This says less about the retailer and more about society as a whole. Target, Sears, Kmart and others are all doing what they need to do maximize sales and profits,"" he said. Just as consumers are driving the demand, employees are choosing to work in the field, leaving companies with little choice but to take advantage of every opportunity in the marketplace, said Bill Peppler with staffing firm Kavaliro. ""In today's economy where jobs are scarce and unemployment is high, people are willing to do more now than they were willing to do two to three years ago. This is especially true in retail. Black Friday alone last year led to almost $12 billion in sales, so you can understand the employers stance on this issue,"" he said. Does this mean that Christmas and New Years shopping is next? Probably not, said Brooks Holtom, associate professor of management at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business. ""I would suggest they are much less at risk because most of the shopping we see at Thanksgiving is in anticipation of Christmas. The incentive for retailers to open on Christmas and New Year's is much lower."" St. Clair knows it's too late to realistically expect Target to change its tune this year. But she is hopeful that her petition and others like it will make Target's leadership reconsider opening early for Thanksgiving next year. ""Going forward I hope it forces Target and other companies to take another look when they realize how many people out there care about this issue,"" she said. Until then, St. Clair plans to be in the electronics section Thanksgiving night through the morning hours of Black Friday. ""I do value my job and that's my schedule,"" she said. ""I will definitely honor that, as much as I don't agree with it."" Are you a retail employee who has to start work on Thanksgiving for Black Friday? Sound off in the comments section below.

"The sister of a U.S. citizen sentenced to 15 years in a North Korean labor camp defended her brother Thursday, asking leaders of both nations to ""please, just see him as one man."" Pae Jun Ho, known as Kenneth Bae by U.S. authorities, was found guilty of unspecified ""hostile acts"" against the reclusive Stalinist state, the North's state-run Korean Central News Agency reported. KCNA said the Korean-American was arrested November 3 after arriving as a tourist in Rason City, a port in the northeastern corner of North Korea. North Korean law allows up to 10 days of processing before a sentence is enforced, so it wasn't immediately clear when Bae would report for hard labor, or where he was being held in the meantime. ""We just pray, and ask for leaders of both nations to please, just see him as one man, caught in between,"" Terri Chung, Bae's sister, told CNN's Anderson Cooper 360. ""He's a father to three children, and we just ask that he be allowed to come home."" She said her family has spoken to Bae once in the last six months. Sounding ""incredibly calm under the circumstances,"" he called last week and tried to reassure family members, but they are devastated, Chung told Cooper. ""You know, Kenneth is a good man; he's not a spy. He has never had any evil intentions against North Korea, or any other country for that matter,"" she said. Bae is the owner of a tour company and was in North Korea for work, according to Chung. ""He didn't have any problems going there last time, last year five times, so he didn't have any reason to suspect that there would be any trouble this time around,"" she said. Her brother's case raises the possibly of another delicate diplomatic dance over an American captive. In previous instances, North Korea has released Americans in its custody after a visit by some U.S. dignitary -- in recent cases, former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton. But Bae's case could get caught up in the recent tensions between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, as the North is formally known, and the United States. ""You all are aware of the history and how this has happened in the past with U.S. citizens,"" State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell told reporters in Washington. ""But what we're calling for and we're urging the DPRK authorities to do is to grant him amnesty and to allow for his immediate release, full stop."" Ventrell said the State Department is still trying to confirm details of the case through Swedish diplomats who visited Bae last week. Sweden represents U.S. interests in North Korea because Washington has no diplomatic relations with Pyongyang. ""We've had longstanding concerns about the lack of transparency and due process in the North Korean legal system,"" he said. ""So now that Mr. Bae has gone through a legal process, we urge the DPRK to grant him amnesty and immediate release."" U.S. officials have struggled to establish how exactly Bae fell afoul of North Korean authorities. The North Korean statement on his conviction provided no details of the allegations against him. ""This was somebody who was a tour operator, who has been there in the past and has a visa to go to the North,"" a senior U.S. official told CNN on Monday, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the diplomatic sensitivity of the issue. Read more: The North Korea we rarely see . The news comes on the heels of weeks of superheated rhetoric from North Korea, which conducted its third nuclear test in February and launched a satellite into orbit atop a long-range rocket in December. Washington responded by deploying additional missile interceptors on the West Coast, dispatching a missile defense system to the Pacific territory of Guam and bolstering annual U.S.-South Korean military exercises with overflights by nuclear-capable B-2 and B-52 bombers. But the intensity of the North's rhetoric appears to have subsided recently, and the U.S.-South Korean drills finished this week, removing another source of friction. Read more: Why I fled North Korea . Previous situations involving Americans arrested in North Korea have usually been resolved with a red-carpet appearance by a prominent former official. In 2010, former President Jimmy Carter secured the release of Aijalon Mahli Gomes, a former English teacher who had been sentenced to eight years of hard labor for entering the North from China.  In 2009, the North freed American journalists Laura Ling and Euna Lee to former President Bill Clinton. Ling and Lee had been arrested while reporting from the North Korean-Chinese border and sentenced to 12 years in a labor camp. Analysts say high-level visits are a show of respect toward Pyongyang, a propaganda boost for the North that gives it a face-saving way to release a captive. In 2009, North Korean officials rejected several lower-level envoys before settling on Clinton, who sat for three hours of dinner and photos with then-North Korean leader Kim Jong Il. In one recent case, however, North Korea released an American prisoner without any apparent U.S. intervention. Robert Park had been arrested after crossing into the North to bring ""a message of Christ's love and forgiveness"" to Kim Jong Il in December 2009; he was released the following February, after what the state-run news agency KCNA called an ""admission and sincere repentance of his wrongdoings."" CNN iReport: Our global fear and fascination . But a visit to Pyongyang in January by a delegation led by Former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson and Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt didn't appear to make any breakthrough in Bae's case. The State Department had objected to the delegation's trip, saying it was ill-timed. The visit took place about a month after North Korea had launched a long-range rocket that put an object in orbit and prompted condemnation from the international community. North Korea is considered to have one of the most repressive penal systems in the world. Human rights groups estimate that as many as 200,000 people are being held in a network of prison camps that the regime is believed to use to crush political dissent. The United Nations Human Rights Council said in March that it would set up a commission of inquiry to examine what it called ""grave, widespread and systematic"" violations of human rights in North Korea. North Korea reacted to the move with indignation, saying it had ""one of the best systems for promotion and protection of human rights in the world.""

"The military coup d'etat that ousted Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy brought with it some diplomatic complications for other nations -- namely, that they want to avoid calling it a coup. A description of this week's events -- the military placing the president under house arrest and naming a new leader of its choosing -- fit the definition of a coup. But labeling it as such could mean an end of U.S. military aid to Egypt, and subsequently a deterioration of relations with an important ally in the Middle East and North Africa. For now, Western nations have avoided using the word ""coup,"" preferring to watch developments unfold, and pointing to the fact that popular sentiment appears on the side of the military. Defining a ""coup d'etat"" The most accepted definition of a coup is a sudden overthrow of a government by a group of conspirators. The events in Egypt are troubling because Morsy's government had been elected democratically. But an autocratic style had turned many of those who voted for him against his leadership and created deep divisions in Egypt. The massive protests that took place before the coup, and the celebrations afterward, lead some observers to define it as a revolution. But there are previous examples of situations where the public turned on a leader and were labeled a coup nonetheless. The environment that led to the ouster of former Honduran President Jose Manuel Zelaya in 2009 was similar to what was seen in Egypt. ""There was a significant amount of conflict within the country. There's a degree -- a high degree -- of polarization. There was a worry about the -- some of the policies that the president undertook and so on,"" then Assistant Secretary of State Arturo Valenzuela said of Honduras. The State Department was slow to call it a coup, but eventually stated the action against Zelaya was unjustifiable. The United States temporarily stopped some aid programs to Honduras. Still, when it comes to conflicted countries, the United States has more interests tied to Egypt than Honduras, keeping the Obama administration from calling it what it is -- a coup. Repercussions of a coup . It matters what the government calls the Egyptian military's seizure of power, because there is money at stake. Call it a coup and some of the $1.5 billion in annual aid that the United States gives Egypt is put in jeopardy. ""If this were to be seen as a coup, then it would limit our ability to have the kind of relationship we think we need with the Egyptian armed forces,"" Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey told CNN. Egypt is a key player in U.S. foreign policy in the region, and anything to sour that relationship could have unintended consequences. So it was no coincidence that President Barack Obama's statement on the coup did not actually use the word ""coup."" He didn't call upon the military to restore power to ""the democratically elected civilian government,"" but rather to ""a democratically elected civilian government."" In other words, it need not be deposed President Mohamed Morsy's. The thinking of the president and administration officials, according to a knowledgeable source, is that while the administration is not explicitly supporting the removal of Morsy from power -- it expressly did not support the move -- it is seeking to push the Egyptian military in a direction. But U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, called Friday for the suspension of U.S. aid to Egypt's military. ""We cannot repeat the same mistakes that we made at other times in our history by supporting the removal of freely elected governments,"" the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Armed Services told CNN affiliate KNXV. Once the military sets a timetable for elections and a new constitution, ""then we should evaluate whether to continue the aid,"" he said. A democratic coup? The Egyptian coup presents a unique case in that there was a popular uprising that accompanied it. While military coups usually have the goal of concentrating power in the hands of the armed forces, in this case, the generals immediately named a civilian jurist as interim leader. It is a role reminiscent of the uprising that ousted former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in 2011. In that instance, the military took over in the interim until democratic elections could be held. Once again, the military is stating that it does not want to impose a military dictatorship, but instead usher in another democratically elected government. Law professor Ozan O. Varol published a paper in the Harvard International Law Journal after Mubarak's ouster, arguing that the events of 2011 broke the mold of traditional military coups. ""Although all coups have anti-democratic features insofar as they place the military in power by force or the threat of force, some military coups are distinctly more democracy-promoting than others,"" he wrote. ""In these coups, the military responds to popular opposition against an authoritarian or totalitarian regime, overthrows that regime, and facilitates fair and free elections within a short span of time."" The current situation in Egypt is still playing out, but Varol's research explains why many see this week's coup as the expression of the popular will of the people.","The overthrow of Egypt's Morsy meets most definitions of a coup .
But the events in Egypt are not universally being called a coup .
Calling it such may lead to a halt of aid to Egypt ."
"Editor's note: This is part one of a series of reports CNN.com is featuring from an upcoming, six-hour television event, ""God's Warriors,"" hosted by CNN chief international correspondent Christiane Amanpour. Daveed Gartenstein-Ross was born to Jewish parents in Ashland, Oregon. A college friend introduced him to Islam. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The path to faith often takes unexpected twists. In the case of Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, the road went through three of the world's major religions -- Judaism, Islam and Christianity -- and ultimately brought him to the FBI. Born to Jewish parents who call themselves mystics, he grew up in what he calls the ""liberal hippie Mecca"" of Ashland, Oregon, a town of about 20,000 near the California border. It was in this ultraliberal intellectual environment that a young Gartenstein-Ross experimented with a radical form of Islam that eventually led him to shun music, reject women's rights and even refuse to touch dogs because he believed this was ""according to God's will."" ""I began to pray for the mujahedeen, for these stateless warriors who were trying to topple secular governments,"" he said. His journey began in 1997, when as a junior at Wake Forest University, he began to examine his own spiritual identity after experiencing a couple of brushes with death caused by illness. ""That kind of thing can cause spiritual discomfort and make you reevaluate what it is that you're living for,"" he told CNN in an upcoming documentary called ""God's Warriors.""  Watch behind-the-scenes with CNN's Christiane Amanpour » . A college friend introduced him to Islam and he was intrigued by its peaceful message. ""Islam was a very simple faith and as I learned more and more about it, it seemed more and more fascinating to me,"" he said. That fall, he called home to tell his parents he was planning to become a Muslim. ""We felt it was OK,"" his father Moshe Ross said. ""We were glad that he was going to study something and hopefully seriously. And we were happy with Islam."" When Gartenstein-Ross returned to Ashland, he got his first taste of radicalization when an imam at a local makeshift mosque blasted Western society. ""His argument was that the West was so inherently corrupt, so inherently anti-Islamic, that if we stayed in this society, then inevitably our faith would be eroded,"" said Gartenstein-Ross, who chronicled his experience in a book called ""My Year Inside Radical Islam."" The humble mosque would soon move to a hilltop headquarters in Ashland, thanks to financial support from a Saudi Arabian charity known as the Al-Haramain Islamic Foundation, which has since been shut down by U.S. and Saudi authorities for alleged terror ties. Lawyers for Al-Haramain have denied those charges and have filed suit against the U.S. government seeking to have its name cleared. Gartenstein-Ross said a man named Pete Seda, who ran the charity's local office, offered him a job. Seda became his mentor and within a few months Gartenstein-Ross said he found himself agreeing with extreme views. At Al-Haramain, he said he saw the religion which he had embraced for its tolerance become obsessed with rules and ideology. ""What I didn't expect was that over time my ideas would fall into line with theirs,"" he said. ""I wasn't to shake hands with women. I wasn't to pet a dog. I wasn't to wear shorts that came up above my knees. But conversely, my pants legs couldn't be too long."" But at times, he still had doubts about some beliefs espoused at the mosque. Whenever he questioned the rules, his co-workers would tell him his own views were irrelevant. The view was that ""your moral inclinations do not matter. All that matters is whether this is what's right according to God's will,"" said Gartenstein-Ross. In 1999 he left his job at Al-Haramain for law school at New York University. Away from his co-workers, he was free to question the radical doctrines he'd learned in Oregon and meet with others about spirituality, including Christians. A year later, he converted to Christianity and was eventually baptized in the Baptist church. It was a decision he took extremely seriously because he said his colleagues at Al-Haramain had preached that leaving Islam was punishable by death. ""This conversion out of Islam toward Christianity was certainly not one I took lightly in any way, because I realized there could be repercussions from it,"" he said. The Al-Haramain Islamic Foundation would come up in his life again, but in a very different fashion. His first job after law school was as a clerk with the U.S. Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia. He had to undergo a background check and listed Al-Haramain as a previous employer. Soon, the FBI was quizzing him about the group. Two years later, in 2004, federal agents raided the Ashland offices of Al-Haramain. When he learned of the bust, Gartenstein-Ross says he contacted the FBI. ""I knew about some of Al-Haramain's contempt for U.S. tax law. I knew about the support these guys had for the mujahedeen in Chechnya,"" he said. His mentor, Pete Seda, and another top Al-Haramain official now face conspiracy and tax fraud charges for allegedly helping provide $150,000 in funds meant for Muslim fighters in Chechnya. Lawyers for the group say it renounces terrorism, and in a lawsuit filed against the government last week, Al-Haramain says it's a ""charitable organization that seeks to promote greater understanding of the Islamic religion."" Seda on Wednesday voluntarily returned to the United States to fight the charges and entered a plea of not guilty. As for Gartenstein-Ross, he is now a counter-terrorism consultant who works with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington think-tank formed after September 11, 2001, that lists former FBI director Louis Freeh, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Sen. Joseph Lieberman among its ""distinguished advisers."" He acknowledges his experience is atypical -- that most American Muslims are well-assimilated into American society and don't embrace radical Islamic ideas. ""There is a lot that's going right about Islam in the United States, and a lot of the conversations I've had with moderate Muslims and other Muslims in the past year-and-a-half have been encouraging in terms of what's happening with Islam in America,"" he said.

"President Barack Obama took veiled shots at governors who are mandating quarantines for health workers returning to the United States after treating Ebola patients Tuesday. But the military -- where the Army has already imposed similar quarantines -- is ""a different situation,"" Obama said Tuesday. Without mentioning them by name, Obama criticized New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and others for the quarantines they've imposed for health workers, saying they ""aren't based on science and best practices"" and calling them ""another barrier on somebody who's already doing really important work on our behalf."" Christie, though, pointed to the discrepancy between how health workers and military members are being treated as he defended himself in an NBC interview Tuesday morning. ""Now six other states have joined us as well, both Republican and Democratic governors. As has the United States military,"" Christie said. Obama, though, said he has no problem with members of the military facing different policies than the general public because their service in West Africa, at the epicenter of the Ebola outbreak, isn't voluntary. ""It's part of their mission that's been assigned to them by their commanders and ultimately by me, the commander-in-chief,"" he told reporters on the White House's South Lawn on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, the Pentagon is preparing to announce new policies on whether military members returning from Ebola-related assignments will be monitored or have their travel restricted. Jessica L. Wright, the undersecretary of Defense for personnel and readiness, issued an Oct. 10 memo that said troops who have faced an elevated risk of exposure to Ebola will be quarantined for 21 days -- and that those who haven't faced any known exposure will be monitored for three weeks. Since then, the Army has announced quarantines for all members who return from West Africa. A Pentagon spokeswoman said Tuesday that Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel is reviewing the Army's move and ""will have a decision soon"" on whether it will be extended to other branches of the military.

"With the United States now launching airstrikes in Syria -- the seventh country bombed under the Obama administration—debate over foreign policy has once again ballooned, pitting the interventionist hawks against non-interventionist doves. A new CNN/ORC International survey indicates that half of Americans consider themselves doves on foreign policy, while slightly less describe themselves as hawks. The poll also shows that two-thirds of Americans describe President Obama, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, as a dove, while 29% consider him a hawk. Hawks vs. Doves . The President's plan to ""degrade and ultimately destroy"" ISIS includes a coalition airstrike campaign and the arming and training of Syrian rebel forces that are also fighting the extremist group. Altogether, the plan marks yet another U.S. involvement overseas. According to the survey, 50% of Americans view themselves as doves, defined in the poll as ""someone who believes the U.S. should rarely or never use military force,"" compared to 45% who self-identify as hawks, ""someone who believes that military force should be used frequently to promote U.S. policy."" CNN exclusive: ISIS fighter says U.S. airstrikes aren't effective . That trend between hawks and doves has ""remained remarkably consistent over the years,"" said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. The number of self-described hawks typically ranges between 44% and 45%, with the number of hawks slightly higher, and in recent years, hovering around the 50% mark. Hawks are more likely to be men, live in the South and Midwest, come from rural areas, and have no college education, Holland said. ""Self-described doves are more likely to be women, live in the Northeast and the West, come from urban areas and have at least some college education,"" he added. Next step: Keeping anti-ISIS coalition together . There's a significant age gap, as well. Sixty-six percent of those under the age of 35 prefer a dovish foreign policy, while a majority of those older than 35 say they are hawks. Breaking the numbers down by political affiliation, nearly seven in 10 Republicans call themselves hawks, compared to nearly six in 10 Democrats and independents who say they are doves. Opinions of Obama . Obama came into office pledging to end U.S.-led wars but now finds himself as a commander in chief who has ordered airstrikes in a host of countries in the Middle East and in Africa. The President has always recognized there are times when military force is necessary. Even when he accepted his Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, he said there could be instances when war is ""morally justified."" Analysis: America's wartime president . It appears that most Americans still consider him a dovish president. Sixty-five percent view him as a dove, while about three in 10 Americans consider him a hawk, according to the survey. On the question of whether the U.S. should take the lead in solving all the world's problems, 58% say ""no."" That represents a similar viewpoint that Obama has advocated in the past. The poll was conducted for CNN by ORC International by telephone with 1,010 adult Americans on September 22-25. The overall sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points.","A new CNN poll indicates half of Americans self-identify as foreign policy doves .

"Editor's note: Buzz Aldrin, whose new book is ""Magnificent Desolation,"" was one of the two American astronauts who were the first people to set foot on the moon. Buzz Aldrin walks on the moon in a photo taken by Neil Armstrong, his colleague on the 1969 mission. (CNN) -- Four decades have passed since the summer of 1969, when Neil Armstrong, Mike Collins and I flew America's first lunar landing mission. The passage of time has not faded either the memory of that summer or the importance of what we achieved, for our mission was about more than just exploring the moon. On July 20, 1969, Neil and I were peering out the window of our lunar lander, the Eagle, as it descended toward the lunar surface. The ship's computer was steering us toward a field of boulders the size of cars. That same computer -- with less power than today's pocket calculators -- was signaling that it was overworked and dangerously overloaded. Our single tank of fuel was nearly empty as we approached the surface, invisible to us, cloaked in a cloud of swirling dust. Neil took manual control and flew us toward a smoother terrain. Then, as the shadow of our landing gear appeared etched onto the surface in the gloom, a light on our console flashed that contact had been made. ""Houston, Tranquility Base Here,"" Neil radioed to the listening world back home. ""The Eagle has landed!"" For more than two hours, we explored the moon's dusty surface. We could easily tell that the planet we had landed on was very different from our home. The horizon visibly curved away in the distance, a sign of the moon's much smaller landscape. When my boot struck moon dust, the soils flew away in a straight line, a sign of the lighter gravity load, one-sixth that of Earth. When I looked around the stark landscape, it was a magnificent desolation. An uninviting world greeted us in eerie silence, hostile to our presence and to all visitors from Earth. The following day, we rocketed up off the surface, rejoined Mike Collins orbiting alone in our command ship, the Columbia, and headed home to a hero's welcome. That welcome took us all around the world in parades, banquets and greetings from millions. I was astonished that so many had followed every facet of our flight from start to finish, almost as if they were part of the adventure. That spirit, of a world come together in celebration of a peaceful scientific achievement, was perhaps our greatest legacy. More than just exploring a hostile new world, Apollo 11 was about bold vision and great risk, about the obstacles a great nation could overcome with dedication, courage and teamwork. It was about choosing a goal that exceeded our grasp -- and then reaching across history to make it happen. For me, the most difficult part of the mission wasn't what happened during the flight but what happened after we came home. Without a new mission to train for, I felt lost and without a purpose. My personal life was marked by deep depression and bouts of drinking. Nothing I did seemed to have meaning or motivation for me. I left the Air Force, the space program, and was adrift. But then, as I began to recover my bearings, something wonderful happened. I met a woman, Lois Driggs Cannon, who helped me to climb out of my depression and see a role for me in space -- but this time while on Earth. I came to dedicate my life to opening space to the average person and crafting designs for new spaceships that could take us far from home. But since Apollo ended, such travels were only in our collective memory. For these past decades, our country has achieved great things in space. It has built a reusable spacecraft and flown it more than 100 times. It has orbited great observatories that have unlocked the secrets of the universe. Most impressively, it has helped construct an orbiting laboratory that offers the prospect of long-term research into the effects of space flight, research that can not just improve the health and safety of our astronauts but also of people on Earth. But what America hasn't done is inspire the world -- and itself --with a bold vision for our future in space. We have remained, since our Apollo days, locked in Earth orbit. But five years ago, NASA was tasked with returning to the moon by 2020, rerunning the moon race that we won 40 years ago. Not surprisingly, this new race has failed to ignite the imagination of young Americans -- or their leaders. What we truly need is not more Cold War-style competition but a destination in space that offers great rewards for the risks to achieve it. I believe that destination must be homesteading Mars, the first human colony on another world. By refocusing our space program on Mars for America's future, we can restore the sense of wonder and adventure in space exploration that we knew in the summer of 1969. We won the moon race; now it's time for us to live and work on Mars, first on its moons and then on its surface. Exploring and colonizing Mars can bring us new scientific understanding of climate change, of how planet-wide processes can make a warm and wet world into a barren landscape. By exploring and understanding Mars, we may gain key insights into the past and future of our own world. Just as Mars -- a desert planet -- gives us insights into global climate change on Earth, the promise awaits for bringing back to life portions of the Red Planet through the application of Earth Science to its similar chemistry, possibly reawakening its life-bearing potential. Four decades ago, I was privileged to have been part of a great mission of exploration and discovery. But America's future in space has only just started. It is time for us to continue the journey. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Buzz Aldrin.","Buzz Aldrin: Our mission to the moon was shared by the world as an adventure .

"It's over. But just for now. President Barack Obama signed a bill that ends the 16-day partial government shutdown and raises the debt ceiling, the White House said early Thursday morning. Weeks of bitter political fighting gave way to a frenzied night in Washington as Congress passed the bill that would prevent the country from crashing into the debt ceiling. Lawmakers worked precariously close to the midnight debt ceiling deadline amid warnings the government could run out of money to pay its bills if it didn't raise the debt ceiling. Federal workers should expect to return to work Thursday morning, the director of the Office of Management and Budget said. Director Sylvia Mathews Burwell said employees should check the Office of Personnel Management's website for updates. Yosemite National Park said it was already resuming operations Wednesday night. The GOP-led House gave the final stamp of approval to the Senate-brokered bill, passing it easily late Wednesday night. But it wasn't Republicans who made it happen; a majority of that party's caucus actually voted against the measure, which only passed because of overwhelming Democratic support. Read the bill . A temporary bandage . The debt cushion now extends through February 7, with current spending levels being authorized through January 15. That means a few months of breathing room, but little more. After all, the bill doesn't address many of the contentious and complicated issues -- from changes to entitlement programs to tax reform -- that continue to divide Democrats and Republicans. ""We think that we'll be back here in January debating the same issues,"" John Chambers, managing director of Standard and Poor's rating service, told CNN on Wednesday night ""This is, I fear, a permanent feature of our budgetary process."" The heads of the Senate and House budget committees -- Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington and GOP Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin -- will meet Thursday with an eye on addressing these budget divides.  They'll helm budget negotiations intended to come up with a broader spending plan for the rest of fiscal year 2014, which ends on September 30. Obama, for one, didn't seem in the mood Wednesday night for more of the same -- saying politicians in Washington have to ""get out of the habit of governing by crisis."" ""Hopefully, next time, it will not be in the 11th hour,"" Obama told reporters, calling for both parties to work together on a budget, immigration reform and other issues. As he left the podium, Obama was asked whether he believed America would be going through all this political turmoil again in a few months. His answer: . ""No."" Come together . The past 16 days of the partial government shutdown have come at a steep cost. Standard and Poor's estimated it took $24 billion out of the economy. The possibility of a debt default -- something that, Chambers pointed out, is gone for now but not entirely -- spooked investors on Wall Street and hiked interest rates. And then there's the impact the ordeal had on politicians' image. If there's one thing polls showed Americans agreed on, it's that they don't trust Congress -- with Republicans bearing more blame than anyone else for what transpired. Both sides talked past each other continuously, with Republicans insisting for a time that defunding, delaying or otherwise altering Obamacare must be part of any final deal. Democrats, meanwhile, stood pat in insisting they'd negotiate -- but only after the passage of a spending bill and legislation to raise the debt without unnecessary add-ons. In the end, Democrats largely got what they wanted -- after some last-minute talks by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. ""We've been able to come together for a lot of different reasons,"" said Reid, a Nevada Democrat. Republicans did get a small Obamacare concession: requiring the government to confirm the eligibility of people receiving federal subsidies under the health care program. But while some Republicans, such as tea party favorite Sen. Ted Cruz, claimed moral victories in energizing their movement, House Speaker John Boehner didn't pretend his side was the victor. ""We fought the good fight; we just didn't win,"" Boehner told a radio station in his home state of Ohio. Boehner to fight another day . Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York blasted Cruz and the rest of the tea party wing in Congress for what he called the ""reckless, irresponsible politics of brinksmanship over the last few weeks."" ""It was not America's finest moment,"" he said. Markets soar on agreement . News of the deal brought some relief to Wall Street as well as Washington, with pressure to resolve the impasse building with the approach of the Thursday deadline to raise the debt ceiling or face default. U.S. stocks rose on the news of an agreement, with the benchmark Dow Jones Industrial Average jumping more than 200 points on the day. Reid hailed the agreement he worked out with McConnell as ""historic,"" saying that ""in the end, political adversaries put aside their differences."" McConnell fired an opening salvo for the budget talks expected to begin soon and continue until December when he said any ensuing spending deal should adhere to caps set in a 2011 law that included forced cuts known as sequestration. ""Preserving this law is critically important to the future of our country,"" McConnell said of the Budget Control Act, which resulted from the previous debt ceiling crisis in Washington. The focus on an agreement shifted to the Senate after House Republicans failed on Tuesday to come up with a plan their majority could support, stymied again by demands from tea party conservatives for outcomes unacceptable to Obama and Senate Democrats, as well as some fellow Republicans. Rep. Charles Rangel compares tea party in House to 'confederates' Cruz, despite being in the Senate, is credited with spearheading the House Republican effort to attach amendments that would dismantle or defund the health care reforms known as Obamacare to previous proposals intended to end the shutdown. All were rejected by the Democratic-led Senate, and Obama also pledged to veto them, meaning there was no chance they ever would have succeeded. Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire called the House GOP tactic of tying Obamacare to the shutdown legislation ""an ill-conceived strategy from the beginning, not a winning strategy.""","Federal workers can expect to return to work Thursday morning .
Most House Republicans vote against budget bill, but it still passes .
Asked whether there will be a similar crisis in a few months, Obama flatly says, ""no""

"The full statement delivered by Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak concerning Malaysia Airlines MH370 Monday: . ""This evening I was briefed by representatives from the UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch -- or AAIB. They informed me that Inmarsat, the UK company that provided the satellite data which indicated the northern and southern corridors, has been performing further calculations on the data. Using a type of analysis never before used in an investigation of this sort, they have been able to shed more light on MH370's flight path. ""Based on their new analysis, Inmarsat and the AAIB have concluded that MH370 flew along the southern corridor, and that its last position was in the middle of the Indian Ocean, west of Perth. This is a remote location, far from any possible landing sites. ""It is therefore with deep sadness and regret that I must inform you that, according to this new data, flight MH370 ended in the southern Indian Ocean. ""We will be holding a press conference tomorrow with further details. In the meantime, we wanted to inform you of this new development at the earliest opportunity. We share this information out of a commitment to openness and respect for the families, two principles which have guided this investigation. ""Malaysia Airlines have already spoken to the families of the passengers and crew to inform them of this development. For them, the past few weeks have been heartbreaking.

"It has been 35 years since a group of Iranian students stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took a group of Americans hostage. You have seen this story play out in movies like ""Argo"" and shows like ""Homeland,"" but here are six things about the Iran hostage crisis that you may not have known. 1) This conflict is often described as the United States' first brush with political Islam. In 1979, the Ayatollah Khomeini installed an anti-Western Islamic theocracy, which replaced the pro-Western monarchy of the Shah of Iran.  The U.S. was referred to as ""the Great Satan"" by the new Iranian government, and Iranians looked at the United States with suspicion because of its role in keeping the Shah in power.  Iranians felt the United States meddled too much in Iran's internal affairs, and were afraid the CIA was plotting to return the Shah to power.  The Ayatollah himself blessed the hostage-taking at the embassy, further fueling the government's hard line against the United States. 2) The U.S. Embassy in Tehran warned Washington the embassy would be attacked. By October 1979, the Shah had fled Iran and was staying in Mexico.  There, doctors discovered the Shah was suffering from an aggressive cancer and recommended he be admitted to a hospital in the United States.  The situation in Tehran was already tense, and the head of the diplomatic mission at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran sent several cables to Washington, saying that if the Shah was allowed to come to the United States for treatment, the embassy would be taken.   President Jimmy Carter allowed the Shah into the United States, with much hesitation, and the Iranians were outraged.  They saw this as an excuse to bring the Shah to the United States to plot his return to power.  This was just weeks before the embassy was attacked. 3)  Some of the hostages were beaten and tortured, and even underwent a mock execution. Iran has maintained a narrative that the hostages were treated well, but that is not true.  Not all the hostages were treated the same.  The two women, Ann Swift and Kathryn Koob, said they were treated ""correctly"" by their captors, but others, including Al Golacinski, John Limbert and Rick Kupke, were subject to a mock execution, where they were awakened in the middle of the night, forced to strip to their underwear and marched to a room in the basement where their guards made it seem they were about to be executed by firing squad.  The guards fired their weapons, but they were not loaded.  Then the guards laughed.  Why did they do it?  Limbert said it was because ""they thought it would be fun."" 4)  The hostages were released only after President Reagan was sworn in. Ted Koppel described this as the Iranians' last act of cruelty toward President Carter.  Even though the United States and Iran had come to an agreement to free the hostages in December, the Iranians waited literally until the hour President Reagan was sworn in before allowing the plane with the hostages to take off.  The Iranians had a deep hatred of Carter and wanted to deny him this last moment of victory as President. 5)  After the hostages were released, they met with President Jimmy Carter. William Daugherty, who was held in solitary confinement for almost the entire time he was a hostage, said, ""It was not a warm welcome"" when Jimmy Carter flew to the U.S. military base in Germany to meet the hostages right after their release.  The hostages were split on their thinking. Many felt they were left unprotected in the embassy after Carter made the decision to allow the Shah into the United States.   Daugherty said that during the meeting, Carter went around to hug all the hostages, and many remained still with their arms at their sides and did not return his hug. 6)  The former U.S. Embassy in Tehran has been preserved as a museum. The embassy in Tehran is now an Islamic cultural center and a museum, preserved from the days when it was a prison in 1979.  It stands as a symbol of the Iranian revolution, and is known in Iran as the ""den of spies.""  Old typewriters, communication equipment, even old visa photos, are on display.  Every year on the anniversary of the hostage taking, Iranians hold rallies where ""Death to America"" is chanted, just as it was in 1979.","The siege of the U.S. Embassy in Iran was 35 years ago .

"Washington (CNN) -- The much-maligned, color-coded Homeland Security Advisory System is about to be consigned to the proverbial dustbin of history. Not that anyone is really paying attention. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano is expected to announce Thursday that the almost 9-year-old threat alert system will go away in April. It will be replaced by the new National Terror Advisory System that will focus on specific threats in geographical areas, a department source said Wednesday. The source did not provide details of the new system, which Napolitano will unveil at what the department is calling ""the first annual 'State of America's Homeland Security' address"" at George Washington University. The top Democrat and Republican on the House Homeland Security Commission reacted positively to the news, although committee chairman Rep. Peter King, R-New York, reserved judgment on the specifics. ""Though the system served a valuable purpose in the terrible days and months following the terrorist attacks of September 11, it was clearly time for the current color-coded system to be replaced with a more targeted system,"" King said. ""I know they have been working on this for a long time. It sounds to me like the changes they are proposing make sense. We will have to wait and see how they implement this new, more targeted system. I expect the biggest challenge for DHS will be balancing the need to provide useful and timely information with the need to protect sensitive information."" ""The old color coded system taught Americans to be scared, not prepared,"" said ranking member Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Mississippi. ""Each and every time the threat level was raised, very rarely did the public know the reason, how to proceed, or for how long to be on alert. I have raised concerns for years about the effectiveness of the system and have cited the need for improvements and transparency. Many in Congress felt the system was being used as a political scare tactic -- raising and lowering the threat levels when it best suited the Bush administration."" President George W. Bush established the Homeland Security Advisory System by presidential directive on March 11, 2002, just a few months after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington. The five levels -- green for low, blue for guarded, yellow for elevated, orange for high and red for severe -- were intended to identify the risk of terrorist attack. The initial level was yellow, which the system retained until September 11, 2002, when it was raised to orange to cover the first anniversary of the attacks. It was lowered back to yellow on September 24. In its lifetime, the threat level has been raised to orange/high five times, although it went to that level three other times for specific industries. The threat level was raised to red/severe once -- on August 10, 2006, and only for commercial flights from the United Kingdom to the United States -- when British authorities announced they had disrupted a major plot to blow up aircraft. The level went down to orange on August 16, 2006, where it remains. The general threat level is yellow/elevated. The two lower levels have never been used, and task force looking at the system recommended in 2009 eliminating them altogether and making yellow the lowest threat level but renaming it ""guarded."" Almost from the start, the threat level system was the butt of jokes and multiple parodies. The ""Democracy Threat Advisory Level"" went from green/low (""Wow, clean money systems really work"") to red/severe (""Martial law, but it's for your own good""). A ""Total Headcase Advisory System"" began with ""George Soros is arrested"" and ended with ""Hillary Clinton is elected president."" Still another announced that Homeland Security and Crayola had jointly revised the system, changing green to aquamarine, blue to raw umber, yellow to burnt sienna, orange to neon carrot and red to cotton candy. The public didn't care much for the system either, with polls conducted at the time indicating most Americans found it confusing and not very useful. More seriously, however, some critics accused the Bush administration of using using the system to generate fear at politically sensitive times, such as just before the 2004 election. And just days after his 2005 resignation, then-Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge told a Washington forum that he sometimes disagreed with the rationale for raising the alert but was overruled by others on the Homeland Security Advisory Council, which made the decisions. The council included Attorney General John Ashcroft, FBI chief Robert Mueller, CIA director George Tenet, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and Secretary of State Colin Powell. ""More often than not we (the department) were the least inclined to raise it,"" Ridge told reporters after the forum. ""Sometimes we disagreed with the intelligence assessment. Sometimes we thought even if the intelligence was good, you don't necessarily put the country on (alert). ... There were times when some people were really aggressive about raising it, and we said, 'For that?' "" And in 2009, Ridge wrote in a tell-all book that sometimes officials such as Ashcroft and Rumsfeld pressured the department to change the level, describing a 2004 event in which his arguments against raising the alert worked. ""I believe our strong interventions had pulled the 'go-up' advocates back from the brink. But I consider the episode to be not only a dramatic moment in Washington's recent history, but another illustration of the intersection of politics, fear, credibility and security,"" he wrote. ""After that episode, I knew I had to follow through with my plans to leave the federal government,"" he wrote. Ridge announced his resignation on November 30, 2004, and left office on February 1, 2005. The Bush administration denied Ridge's assertions, however. ""Nobody's more surprised than I am,"" then-Homeland Security adviser Fran Townsend told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. ""Of course, Tom Ridge never expressed those concerns while he was in the administration, nor did he when I spoke to him after he left ... (He) wasn't the only one in that meeting who suggested the terror alert shouldn't be raised. At no time was there a discussion of politics in that meeting. And the president was made a consensus recommendation from the council that he accepted -- not to raise the terror alert."" Townsend is now a national security contributor for CNN.

"According to court documents that surfaced this week, General Motors' engineers knew about ignition-switch problems in the Chevrolet Cobalt as early as 2009. The company may have been aware of the dangers as early as 2005 soon after the first Cobalts rolled off the assembly line in 2004. Since 2009, at least a dozen deaths have resulted from the flaw in which, upon impact, the ignition switch slips out of the ""on"" position and thus prevented airbags from deploying. Last month, GM announced the recall of 1.6 million Cobalts. In a June 2013 deposition, Gary Altman, program engineering manager for the 2005 Cobalt, was asked whether GM made a business decision not to address the problem.  ""That is what happened, yes,"" said Altman. This news comes just a week after Toyota Motor Corporation announced it would pay $1.2 billion to settle pending criminal charges from the Department of Justice alleging Toyota covered up evidence of safety defects in its vehicles. ""The private sector is more efficient,"" says Sen. Rand Paul and his fellow conservatives.  Really?  Efficient at what, exactly — fraud, deception and disaster? Many of the public policy disagreements between conservatives and progressives are at essence a debate over whether government or the private sector is best equipped to provide vital services.  Conservatives argue that government can be bloated and inefficient, which is certainly true sometimes, but attributing those characteristics to all government is like accusing every small businessperson of being Bernie Madoff. At its heart, whatever the occasional shortcomings, government exists solely for the purpose of advancing the public good.  That's the mission.  That's the entire design of the enterprise.  Corruption, waste and falling short on delivery are inherently anathema to the core principles and existence of government. On the other hand, the point of the private sector is to make money.  That's a good thing.  Private enterprise is a vital engine of economic growth and opportunity in America and worldwide.  That said -- if your primary goal is to make money, then hiding inconvenient facts, deceiving customers, cutting corners or sweeping risks under the rug are endemic to your enterprise. In an era of capitalism where businesses are increasingly massive and removed from the direct consequences of their business practices on employees, customers and communities, these profit-at-all-cost impulses are increasingly unbound. That's how you end up with companies knowing that its products are killing or hurting people and yet still refusing to do something about it lest it hurt their bottom line. Today we're talking about the Chevy Cobalt, but before that it was securitized sub-prime mortgages and before that it was tobacco companies selling cigarettes to kids. The list goes on and on and on. And this week, we have the Supreme Court hearing arguments in the Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood cases that private businesses should be able to claim religion in order to evade tenets of the law.  The litigants want to evade compliance with the Obamacare mandate that they provide health insurance that covers contraception. But, as Justice Elena Kagan asked during oral arguments, what's to stop a company from using religion to object to vaccinations?  Or blood transfusions?  Or minimum wage laws or family medical leave or child labor laws?  We've already ushered in unprecedented corporate rights through Citizens United and various doctrines of corporate personhood.  Do we really need to go a step further and let corporations use religion as a loophole to rationalize their whims? More importantly, in spite of example after example to the contrary, why do we trust corporations to tell us the truth and do the right thing when they are not only designed but incentivized to do the opposite?  Why on earth would we trust oil companies to tell us that fracking poses no harm to our drinking water?  Or that our old health insurance policies are good ones?  Or that our education system would be better off in their hands? It seems that almost every day there's yet another corporation covering up how it endangered people's safety and well-being for the sake of profit. This is why we need to strengthen checks and balances of government regulation and be wary of privatizing vital public services.","General Motors may have known about problems with Chevrolet Cobalt back in 2005 .

"Joran van der Sloot has been tied to the disappearance of one woman and been convicted of murdering another. Now, he's a taken man. The Dutch national, who is serving a 28-year sentence for the killing of Stephany Flores -- married a Peruvian woman named Leidy Figueroa on Friday morning, his attorney told CNN en Espanol. The nuptials took place at the Lima, Peru, prison where the 26-year-old van der Sloot is being held, according to the lawyer, Maximo Altez. John Barrera, Mayor of Ancón District, presided over the ceremony. Van der Sloot is expected to become a father in September, when Figureoa is due to give birth to their child together, Altez said. But just like he won't have a honeymoon anytime soon, van der Sloot won't be around to change diapers after the baby heads home. That's because he has been sentenced to 28 years for the murder of Flores. Once he's eligible to get out of prison for that crime, van der Sloot is set to be extradited to the United States to face charges related to the case of Natalee Holloway, the Alabama 18-year-old last seen leaving an Aruba nightclub in 2005 with van der Sloot and two other men. Peru agrees to extradite Joran van der Sloot to U.S. ... in 24 years . Accountant met inmate while visiting a relative . There's no reason to believe that Figueroa didn't know about van der Sloot's past when the two first encountered one another. They met when Figueroa, an accountant with a young boy from another relationship, was visiting a relative in the Peruvian prison where van der Sloot was being held. ""They became friends and spent a lot of time together in his cell,"" Altez said earlier this year. ""Unlike the United States, here in Peru, loved ones or relatives can see inmates inside their jails."" In January 2012, van der Sloot made a far different pronouncement when he pleaded guilty to all charges against him in Flores' killing. ""I am really sorry for what happened,"" he told the three magistrates overseeing his trial in Lima. 2012: Joran van der Sloot sentenced to 28 years for Peru murder . Police say van der Sloot killed the then 21-year-old Flores in his Lima hotel room in May 2010, then took money and bank cards from her wallet and fled to Chile. He was arrested a few days later in that South American country. Investigators believe van der Sloot killed Flores after she found something related to the Holloway case on van der Sloot's computer as she visited with him in his hotel room. Lawyer: 'No hidden agendas' with marriage . Holloway's body has never been found, and her case -- which drew intense international attention in the weeks after it unfolded -- has never been solved. Van der Sloot himself was arrested twice in Aruba in connection with the Alabama teenager's disappearance. However, he was never charged in that Caribbean nation. He has been charged in the United States in relation to her case, though. In June 2010, a federal grand jury based in Alabama indicted van der Sloot on charges of allegedly attempting to extort $250,000 from Holloway's mother, Beth. Van der Sloot offered to provide what turned out to be bogus information about the whereabouts of Holloway's remains in exchange for the money, according to the indictment against him. He was allegedly given $25,000, which authorities say he used to travel to Peru for a poker tournament. 2012: Natalee Holloway declared legally dead . In March, Peru agreed to extradite van der Sloot to the United States on these charges sometime after he's eligible for release, in 2038, for Flores murder. Peruvian media have raised the possibility that van der Sloot got married to avoid extradition to the United States. But Altez, his defense lawyer, this spring dismissed that suggestion, saying then that the wedding shouldn't be ""a big deal."" ""He's getting married because he's in love and is having a child,"" Altez said in May. ""There are no hidden agendas.""","Joran van der Sloot marries a woman who he met as she visited his Lima prison .

"It was a sad day in the clown world when a ""clown"" at the Missouri State Fair put on a mask in the likeness of President Barack Obama and wore a broomstick attached to his behind to perform in a rodeo in America's Heartland. Some would ask: How this is different from late-night pundits making mocking comments about every political person alive?  It is different in that it goes against everything a clown stands for and makes fun of our president in a way that is truly offensive on so many levels. As someone who has performed as a ""real"" clown for 32 years and has taught the craft to hundreds of clowns, I would like the world to know that we have a code of ethics that we adhere to so that our life of making the world smile goes on without hurting people.  Among the ethics is a ban on ""blue humor."" This mean no sexual or racial humor. The joke always needs to be on us and never on an audience member. If someone is offended or made the ""victim"" of a joke, it is totally against what the clown community would consider funny. So what is this clown community and where do I get these ethics? One of the main international clown organizations based in the United States is Clowns of America, International. We are 3,000 members strong and are organized into clown ""alleys,"" groups that perform together. As part of our training, and really the training of most clowns, we have a strict code of ethics covering such things as drinking while clowning, cleanliness and remaining in character.  We take offense at the actions of the rodeo ""clown"" because we are strictly trained not to offend anyone while ""in clown."" The individual who took on the role of a clown in Missouri might have made some people laugh, but it was at the expense of so many others. What of the children who were in the audience and being taught to respect our president and government? What of every person in the audience who hates racism? What of the officials of the state of Missouri who are now the focus of national attention in this negative light? Forgive me for taking this forum to air another form of ""clown"" I find very offensive: the horror clown. In my travels as ""Dear Heart"" the clown, I encounter many people of all ages who are afraid of clowns.  Perhaps some are afraid of anyone who is behind makeup, but most have had the experience of a house of horror where a person dressed as a clown has frightened them and, in doing so, has robbed them of fun and playful experiences for life. Being a ""real clown"" takes training, money and a lot of time.  We each develop a character that is an extension of ourselves. Real clowns have clown hearts long before we put on makeup. Our goal is to make the world a happier place.  One part of our national organization, Red Nose Response, allows clowns go to places where there have been disasters and pitch in -- helping to distribute needed supplies but also helping to keep the spirits of people up. I am most proud when I come home having given a balloon flower to an elderly person who responds with a big smile or having taught a child who is in a hospital long-term the basics of juggling. And so what is there that I have described about ""real clowns"" that applies to the Missouri rodeo performer?  Absolutely nothing. As for the people in Texas who have said he would be welcome to perform there: Please think about that and what you are really doing. I believe that people today desperately need a reason to smile and a chance to forget their troubles for a moment and laugh. These laughs are most cherished if they are only for fun and do not offend or hurt another human being.","Judy Quest: Offensive act by ""clown"" at Missouri fair mocked Obama; this is not real clowning .

"(CNN) -- The court of public opinion has hardly been supportive of Bill Cosby, but the 77-year-old comedian still has his defenders. Last week, singer Jill Scott engaged with several people on her Twitter account after being approached to sign a petition asking Temple University to cut its ties with Cosby. Cosby, who attended the school and served on its board, has been accused of rape by a number of women in recent weeks. Through his attorneys, he has repeatedly denied the claims. Cosby facing litany of allegations . ""oh ok. So they've proven the alleged allegations? I didn't know. Will they also be giving him back the millions he's donated?"" Scott tweeted to the petition request. On Sunday, Scott responded to criticism with another tweet. ""u know Bill Cosby? I do child and this is insane. Proof. Period,"" she wrote. Cosby resigned from the Temple board of trustees on Monday, but his Twitter account, @BillCosby, took note of Scott's support Wednesday morning. ""Thank you @MissJillScott, from the Cosby Family,"" read the tweet. Cosby also thanked Whoopi Goldberg. On the November 17 edition of ""The View,"" Goldberg said that people should be skeptical of what they hear. ""Quite honestly, you know, look, I'm sorry, having been on both sides of this where people allege that you do something, it doesn't matter now,"" Goldberg said after the ""View"" panel discussed the allegations of Cosby accuser Barbara Bowman. ""The cat is out of the bag; people have it in their heads. I have a lot of questions for the lady. Maybe she'll come on."" ""Thank you @WhoopiGoldberg,"" responded @BillCosby on Tuesday. Cosby also received support from comedian Faizon Love, though Love's tweets have been more inflammatory. ""you sorry porch monkey deserve everything you get...you gonna stand up for this b*tch and and not a man like Mr. Cosby,"" he wrote on November 22 in response to a person criticizing Cosby. After some back and forth, Love said he doesn't believe in trying Cosby in the media. ""Let me be clear, I don't support rape, but @billcosby has been convicted in the media & that is unjust as well #DueProcess,"" Love tweeted. Love even went so far as to post ""I support Bill Cosby"" in large letters on his Instagram account. The stories of Cosby's purported crimes have been around for about a decade, but in the past two months, they've received new life, stoked particularly by a routine by comedian Hannibal Buress that went viral and a social media stunt that went awry. At least 18 women have spoken publicly accusing the comedian of sexual misconduct, and many of the women say he drugged them before he raped them. Some of the alleged attacks took place decades ago. Cosby's attorney, Martin D. Singer, has repeatedly denied the claims. Singer said in a statement to CNN that it defies common sense that ""so many people would have said nothing, done nothing, and made no reports to law enforcement or asserted civil claims if they thought they had been assaulted over a span of so many years."" On Tuesday, a woman named Judy Huth filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court, claiming sexual battery and infliction of emotional distress during an incident at the Playboy Mansion, according to the documents first obtained by Radar Online (PDF).

"As the world's fastest growing market for mobile phones, Africa is ripe for the upcoming disruption that will be ushered in by ubiquitous Internet access through smartphones. The previous wave of mobile phone adoption on the continent from 2000 to 2010 accelerated at an impressive 30% compound annual growth rate powered by affordable dumb and feature phones sold at mass market price points. Today, the narrative is changing. Read more: 10 African tech startups you need to know . The continent's smartphone market is expected to double in the next four years and device manufacturers who dominated the narrative over the past decade such as Nokia are making big bets on the continent's smartphone future. Microsoft/Nokia through the Lumia Windows phone line are betting that the continent's rising economic fundamentals coupled with a rising hunger for connected devices will spur significant demand. Huawei has since 2011 bet that its sub $100 Android devices will herald a new era of smartphone penetration in some of Africa's largest mobile phone markets like Nigeria and Kenya. Samsung has adopted a similar strategy, targeting student populations and engaging celebrities to trigger mass appeal and its tactics appear to be gaining traction. According to International Data Corp, 52% of all smartphones sold on the continent in the second quarter of 2013 were Samsung phones and the company has quickly ascended in a short period of time to become Africa's smartphone leader. Chinese manufacturer Tecno has also increasingly been making its intentions clear: ""Our desire is to flood the African mobile phone markets with Tecno smartphones,"" its director of marketing, Boukali Mounir said in an interview recently. Tecno humbly started out by introducing relatively simple phones in the African market but very quickly scaled up its offerings to include affordable smartphones and now has its ambitions set on continent-wide domination. Then there is the Blackberry, which despite its cataclysmic woes in Western markets, continues to enjoy significant patronage on the continent. The coming African smartphone wave poses an interesting dilemma for app developers on the continent. Should they invest their skills acquisition and app development efforts in Africa's feature phone past or its exciting smartphone future?  After all, despite the growth prospects, Africa is still largely a feature phone play with smartphones making up 18% of phones in Africa. Read more: Smart cabs and social games - Africa's mobile tech startups . Though the continent's smart phone penetration rate might appear low relative to its number of feature phone users, the addressable market for smartphone users on the continent is already sizeable and is currently growing at about 19% year over year. With 650 million mobile phone subscribers in Africa, there are already about 100 million smartphone users with the number set to double to 200 million users in the next four years. At present, South Africa is reportedly sub-Saharan Africa's largest smartphone market at 19% penetration followed closely by Tanzania, Nigeria and Kenya. Launching the right product with cross-country appeal would be key to success and carrier billing for local apps by indigenous mobile operators would provide a decent monetization path for breakout hits. Much has been analyzed about Africa's rising middle class, a demographic that has been touted to be the world's fastest growing. Despite the controversy surrounding who really comprises this base, McKinsey posits that in the next few years, 40% of the growth in spending power on the continent will be driven by households with an average income of more than $20,000 a year. What makes the continent's smartphone user base particularly interesting is its demographic composition. Africa's smartphone owners overlap significantly with its rising consumer class. Asides the relatively formidable size of their wallets, they are typically the most tech savvy cohort of the general populace and the most likely to use mobile apps solving key pain points in their day to day lives from mobile commerce to transit ticketing. Read more: How African innovation can take on the world . The launch of Uber (the Silicon Valley based startup that connects riders with a driver at the tap of a button on its smartphone app) in Johannesburg, South Africa this past August points to the fact that the philosophy of betting on the continent's smartphone future is increasingly gaining traction. It might be early days in Africa's smartphone history but at its current pace of growth, the future will very quickly merge with the present and eventually supersede it. While feature phone penetration will continue to maintain its healthy lead, smartphone adoption would take on a hockey stick adoption path; a trend that savvy entrepreneurs and app developers will inevitably profit from. The impact that rapid adoption of smartphones on the continent will usher in are legion. From education to retail, Africa's smartphone wave will redefine the continent's future in myriad sectors and at scale.","Africa's smartphone market is expected to double in next four years, says Nmachi Jidenma .

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Iran has successfully test-fired 14 missiles during military drills, Iranian news agencies reported Tuesday. Following the unveiling of several missile silos Monday, Tuesday's exercises are the second day of war games code-named the ""Great Prophet Six."" According to Iran's IRIB news agency, the Islamic Revolutions Guards Corps fired three Shabab ballistic missiles and 11 Zelzal short-range missiles to test the missiles ""'precision, navigation and interceptive capability."" Airing video of one of the facilities as it began a new round of military exercises, Iran announced Monday that it has built its first ballistic missile silos. The hardened, underground launch sites will allow Iranian commanders to fire missiles more quickly, Iran's state-run Press TV reported. A military statement carried by the official Islamic Republic News Agency said the silos were capable of launching long-range missiles. Iran's development of missile and nuclear fuel technology has led to U.N. sanctions and accusations from the United States that the clerical regime is trying to develop nuclear weapons. Iran says it has a right to peaceful nuclear technology, but the International Atomic Energy says it can't verify whether Tehran's nuclear program remains entirely peaceful. The United States and the Soviet Union built more than 1,400 silos to protect their long-range missiles during the Cold War era. In the Iranian statement, military spokesman Col. Asghar Ghelichkhani said the facilities were designed and built with domestic expertise. Western observers say Iran currently has missiles capable of hitting targets up to about 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) away, a range that would cover nearly the entire Middle East and part of southeastern Europe. Iran also launched its first satellite in 2009.","Tuesday is the second day of war games dubbed the ""Great Prophet Six""

"If Edward Snowden's NSA leaks led to changes in government policy, increased civil liberties protections and sparked a national dialogue, does it stand to reason that Edward Snowden is more whistleblower and patriot than traitor? We know where President Barack Obama stands. Even as he announced changes to the NSA programs, including the appointment of an independent government review, at a news conference on Friday, Obama suggested Americans would be better off if they hadn't found out that the government collects vast amounts of phone and Internet data. ""No, I don't think Mr. Snowden was a patriot,"" Obama said. A bit earlier he had argued that his administration was already in the process of reviewing the programs that most Americans didn't know existed. The leaks, he said, hurt that process. ""I called for a thorough review of our surveillance operations before Mr. Snowden made these leaks,"" Obama said. ""My preference, and I think the American people's preference, would have been for a lawful, orderly examination of these laws; a thoughtful fact-based debate that would then lead us to a better place."" Obama: Snowden can make his case in court . Edward Snowden, who has been granted temporary asylum in Russia, hasn't spoken up about the president's remarks, but his father did so on ABC News. ""Much of what he suggested is superficial,"" Lon Snowden said. More specifically, he called the idea that Edward Snowden could have been protected as a whistleblower ""absolutely untrue."" Snowden's father reacts to Obama statement . Lon Snowden appeared on ABC with his lawyer, Bruce Fein, who said the idea that congressional committees, which knew about the classified telephone and e-mail surveillance programs that Snowden disclosed through leaks to media, would have protected him as a whistleblower, is absurd. ""These were the committees that knew for seven years what was going on and refused to disclose it to the American people,"" said Fein. ""The best was some cryptic statements if the American people knew what was going on they would be stunned. And Edward Snowden is supposed to go to them? That seems rather implausible because they were the ones who were responsible for the secrecy."" NSA: We read .00004% of Web traffic . Obama is clearly sensitive to the idea he might be overlooking civil liberties. Snowden, the president argued, should have utilized the federal government's system for whistleblowers instead of leaking classified information. And the president offered his own support for whistleblower protections for government employees in the intelligence community as evidence that he and his administration want whistleblowers to come forward. Those are two important points Obama has made: First, that he was already reviewing the programs and second, that Snowden should have stayed in the United States to make his case either as a whistleblower within the intelligence infrastructure or to Congress and also in court with a lawyer by his side. Here's a look at both of them: . Would Obama's whistleblower protection have helped Snowden? Obama on Friday: ""I signed an executive order well before Mr. Snowden leaked this information that provided whistleblower protection to the intelligence community for the first time."" True -- he signed an executive order in October of 2012 that protects intelligence community whistleblowers. The Intelligence community is exempted from other whistleblower protections he signed into law in 2012. Read the executive order . But that protection does not appear to do much for someone like Snowden, who wanted to blow the whistle to public on a classified program. The order states that classified information should be protected. It also adjudicates through the intelligence committee, which is already complicit and agrees with the program that he disclosed. In other words, Snowden would have been protected in blowing the whistle up to the director of National Intelligence. Currently, that's James Clapper, who has had to apologize for misleading Congress about the existence of the programs. In any case, he already knew about the programs. So that does seem like a bit of a Catch-22. But it is part of a larger debate about whether Americans trust their government to have secret programs. If so, they have to trust the branches of government to do the checking and balancing. Intel chief admits 'erroneous statements' to Congress . What review of intelligence did Obama order in May? Obama said Friday the intelligence programs at the NSA were already under review before Snowden's leaks. He pointed to a speech he gave in May at National Defense University as public proof. That speech was given in the wake of the terror attack by two brothers, one an American citizen, on the Boston Marathon. It was more in line with strengthening capabilities of the intelligence community than it was an examination of civil liberties. Obama did raise concerns about press freedoms from a separate instance where the Department of Justice had sought phone records of The Associated Press as it investigated a leak of classified information about a terror plot emanating from Yemen. Perhaps the fact that the Department of Justice sought warrants for the data the government had apparently already collected is proof that government safeguards were working. But there was no mention in that speech about reviewing the necessity of collecting mass amounts of data from Americans. Of course, nobody really knew at that point about the NSA programs. Here's the relevant excerpt from that May speech: . ""Thwarting homegrown plots presents particular challenges in part because of our proud commitment to civil liberties for all who call America home. That's why, in the years to come, we will have to keep working hard to strike the appropriate balance between our need for security and preserving those freedoms that make us who we are.  That means reviewing the authorities of law enforcement, so we can intercept new types of communication, but also build in privacy protections to prevent abuse. ""That means that -- even after Boston -- we do not deport someone or throw somebody in prison in the absence of evidence.  That means putting careful constraints on the tools the government uses to protect sensitive information, such as the state secrets doctrine.  And that means finally having a strong Privacy and Civil Liberties Board to review those issues where our counterterrorism efforts and our values may come into tension."" Read Obama's full speech at National Defense University . The review Obama announced Friday -- charging an independent group within 60 days ""to step back and review our capabilities, particularly our surveillance technologies."" That seems more on point.","President suggested Americans would have been better off if they hadn't found out about NSA program .
Snowden's father rejects Obama's suggestion that he would have been protected .
Federal whistleblower protection doesn't appear to help someone in Snowden's case ."
"A series of documents released Monday revealed more details of the investigation into what happened the day a Georgia toddler died in a sweltering car -- and whether his father abandoned him on purpose. The documents, which include applications for search warrants and eight actual search warrants in the case against Justin Ross Harris, seek the medical records of Harris and his late son, Cooper Harris; a DVD; a 2-gigabyte memory card; a 32GB thumb drive; and an external hard drive. While Harris remains in jail charged with murder, a slew of recent claims have intensified the case. Among the most shocking allegations: Harris messaged six women and exchanged explicit texts from work while his 22-month-old was dying, a Cobb County detective testified at a hearing Thursday. Harris' attorney repeatedly objected to Detective Phil Stoddard's testimony claiming that Harris sexted the women, one of whom was underage at the time. But the judge allowed the testimony. Police say Harris, 33, left his toddler, Cooper, strapped into a car seat under a baking sun for seven hours while he went to work on June 18. Records show that the mercury topped 92 that day, and police say the temperature was 88 degrees when the boy was pronounced dead in a parking lot not far from his father's workplace. Cobb County Chief Magistrate Frank Cox found probable cause to move forward on murder and child cruelty charges. ""For him to enter the car ... when the child had been dead and rigor mortis had set in, and the testimony is the stench in the car was overwhelming at that point in time, that he -- in spite of that -- got in the car and drove it for some distance before he took any action to check on the welfare of his child, I find there is probable cause for the two charges contained in the warrant,"" Cox told a packed courtroom. The judge denied bail for Harris, who has pleaded not guilty. In addition to the charges he faces in connection with his son's death, Harris may also be charged with felony sexual exploitation of a minor and misdemeanor illegal contact with a minor, Stoddard said. Harris allegedly sent explicit photos, including one of an erect penis, to an underage female. 5 questions about mother in toddler's hot-car death . Internet searches . The detective also testified about Internet searches that could raise eyebrows given the context of the case. Before his son's death, Harris had visited a Reddit page called ""child-free"" and read four articles, Stoddard said. He also allegedly searched how to survive in prison. Among the other details police have released is that Harris and his wife, Leanna Harris, told them they looked up how hot a car needed to be to kill a child. Five days before Cooper died, Ross Harris twice viewed a sort of homemade public service announcement in which a veterinarian demonstrates on video the dangers of leaving someone or something inside a hot car. Leanna Harris told police that she had recently seen a story on a state initiative aimed at reminding people not to leave children in cars and that it was a fear of hers, Stoddard said. Death highlights key role of digital evidence . Ross Harris ""stated that he recently researched, through the Internet, child deaths inside vehicles and what temperature it needs to be for that to occur,"" police have said, adding that Harris told investigators ""he was fearful that this could happen."" During questioning, Leanna Harris ""made similar statements regarding researching in car deaths and how it occurs,"" according to police. The time frame for the alleged research remains unclear. 'I felt his pain; I even wept' Thursday's probable cause hearing was expected to last 90 minutes; it stretched for some three hours. A good chunk of that time was spent discussing how Ross Harris acted after he pulled into a shopping center asking for assistance with his son. Witnesses told police they heard ""squealing tires, and the vehicle came to a stop,"" Stoddard testified. Harris got out of the car yelling, ""Oh, my God, what have I done?"" Stoddard said. Harris then stood there with a blank look on his face, the detective said. When a witness told Harris his son needed CPR, Harris went to the other side of his vehicle and made a phone call, apparently to tell someone his son was dead, a witness told police, according to Stoddard. Harris never called 911, and when an officer told him to get off his phone, he refused and even said, ""F*** you"" before an officer took his phone and handcuffed him, the detective said. He also said that Harris told police he couldn't reach anyone on his telephone, but phone records show that Harris made three calls after he discovered his son's body -- including one with his employer that lasted six minutes, Stoddard said. Who is Justin Ross Harris? But witness Leonard Madden offered a different version of what happened. Madden and an acquaintance were leaving a restaurant when they noticed a commotion and approached within 3 or 4 feet of a clearly distraught Harris. ""He was crying. He was hollering,"" Madden testified, recounting the father saying, ""Oh, my God! Oh, my God, my son is dead!"" ""I felt his pain; I even wept,"" Madden said. Strange behaviors . According to Stoddard, Harris made statements that police felt were strange, including ""I can't believe this is happening to me"" and ""I'll be charged with a felony."" ""It was all about him,"" Stoddard said. ""'Why am I being punished for this?' It continued. It was all very one-sided."" The detective said Harris talked about losing his job. He testified that messages between the Harrises indicate the two were having financial problems. Ross Harris had recently been passed over for a promotion, and the couple had two insurance policies on Cooper, one for $2,000 and one for $25,000, the detective said. At another point in the interview room, Stoddard said, Leanna Harris asked her husband about what he had said to police. ""She asked him -- she had him sit down, and he starts going through this. And she looks at him, and she's like, 'Well, did you say too much?' "" the detective testified. 'Nothing was weird' While prosecutors painted Ross Harris as a terrible, in fact criminal, father, the defense called witnesses who testified on his behalf. James Alex Hall, who worked with Ross Harris and had run a Web development company with him for the past two or three months, said Harris didn't act out of the ordinary on the day his son died. ""I would say normal as you could be. Nothing stuck out. Nothing was weird,"" Hall said. 'That pain ... never goes away' Accident or murder in hot car death?

"London, England (CNN) -- British troops will pull out of the notorious Sangin district of Afghanistan's Helmand province to allow U.S. Marines to take over, British Defense Secretary Liam Fox said Wednesday. The British forces will redeploy to the central part of Helmand, leading the task force with Danish and Estonian troops there, while U.S. troops are positioned in the northern and southern parts, Fox said. ""This will simplify current command arrangements,"" Fox told the House of Commons. ""The result will be a coherent and equitable division of the main populated areas of Helmand between three brigade-size forces."" NATO's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) closely consulted Britain about the plan, and British officials ""fully support"" it, Fox said. ""In Sangin, UK forces have made huge progress in the face of great adversity,"" he said. ""The district center has been transformed. Helmand as a whole is a safer place as a result of our endeavors and sacrifices there."" The switch of command in Sangin is in no way a defeat for British troops, but simply works well militarily, said Michael Clarke, director of the Royal United Services Institute, an independent defense and security think tank in London. ""It never made much military sense to put troops into the northern areas of Sangin, Musa Qala and Kajacki in the first place,"" Clarke said, ""but in 2006 they were sent there at the insistence of (Afghan) President (Hamid) Karzai, and once established, any pullback would have represented a victory for the Taliban."" With the arrival of 18,000 U.S. Marines in the region by the end of August, it makes sense for the British troops to reorganize themselves and reinforce their numbers in central Helmand, Clarke said. It will make the British force more effective and safer, he said. The political fallout of the move, however, is unpredictable, Clarke said. When the British ended operations in the southern Iraqi city of Basra last year, it was under similar circumstances, but still appeared as a ""furtive retreat,"" he said. ""The image at home that Britain was giving up a job it could no longer handle was impossible to shake off,"" Clarke said. ""The same may attach to Sangin. This war is as much about image and perception as it is about who controls the ground in Afghanistan.""","British troops to leave Sangin district of Afghanistan's Helmand province .

"(CNN) -- A family in Saudi Arabia has taken a genie to court, alleging theft and harassment, according to local media. The lawsuit filed in Shariah court accuses the genie of leaving them threatening voicemails, stealing their cell phones and hurling rocks at them when they leave their house at night, said Al-Watan newspaper. An investigation was under way, local court officials said. ""We have to verify the truthfulness of this case despite the difficulty of doing so,"" Sheikh Amr Al Salmi, the head of the court, told Al-Watan. ""What makes this case and complaint more interesting is that it wasn't filed by just one person. Every member of the family is part of this case."" The family, which has lived in the same house near the holy city of Medina for 15 years, said it became aware of the spirit in the past two years. ""We began hearing strange noises,"" the head of the family, who requested anonymity, told Al-Watan. ""In the beginning, we didn't take it seriously, but after that, stranger things started happening and the children got really scared when the genie began throwing stones."" A local charity has moved the family to a temporary residence while a court investigates, the newspaper said. In Islamic cultures, a belief in genies, or jinns, is common. Genies not only appear in pre-Islamic fiction such as ""Arabian Nights,"" but are also mentioned in the Quran. Many Saudis believe invisible genies live among them and are capable of demonic possession and revenge.

"Kenneth Bae, a Korean-American being held in North Korea, says he is worried about his health after authorities moved him back into a labor camp following a stay in a hospital. ""I know if I continue for the next several months here, I will probably be sent back to the hospital again,"" Bae says in a video of a conversation with a Swedish diplomat recorded Friday. Footage of the conversation in the labor camp was released by Choson Sinbo, a pro-North Korean newspaper based in Japan that has been given access to Bae in the past. Wearing a gray jacket with the prisoner number ""103"" marked on it, Bae tells the Swedish diplomat, Cecilia Anderberg, that he thinks his weight has already dropped as much as 10 pounds since he was transferred back to the camp a few weeks ago. Bae's sister, Terri Chung, told CNN's ""The Lead"" that he looked worse than he did when he last appeared three weeks ago, in a hospital. ""I'm glad that he's holding strong, but I'm really concerned about his health,"" Chung said. ""And the fact that he's been moved to the labor camp, we're really discouraged by that."" The 45-year-old Bae, of Lynwood, Washington, was arrested in November 2012 in Rason, along North Korea's northeastern coast. Pyongyang sentenced him last year to 15 years of hard labor, accusing him of planning to bring down the government through religious activities. He is widely reported to have been carrying out Christian missionary work in North Korea. U.S. civil rights leader Jesse Jackson has offered to go to North Korea to help get Bae released, a move the U.S. State Department says it supports. ""We're just waiting and hoping for a positive response,"" Chung said. ""Every day we hold out hope that there is going to be some good dialogue between the two countries that will lead to Kenneth's release soon,"" she added. In the video, he expresses hope that North Korea will allow a U.S. envoy to visit for talks about his case -- but those hopes appeared to have been dashed over the weekend. A State Department official said Sunday that North Korea had rescinded its invitation to the envoy, Ambassador Robert King, without giving a reason. Hours later, the North's state-run Korean Central News Agency reported that a former U.S. ambassador to South Korea, Donald Gregg, had arrived in Pyongyang. The brief KCNA report Monday didn't state the purpose of the visit by Gregg, the chairman of the Pacific Century Institute, a U.S. nonprofit group that aims to promote education, dialogue and research in the Pacific region. But U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said Gregg was traveling with other former diplomats on a trip to ""build bridges,"" and his visit was unrelated to Bae's case. In a written statement earlier Monday, Chung said the family was ""saddened to hear"" that King's invitation had been rescinded. But she added, ""While we reel from this heartbreaking news, we are encouraged by the growing chorus of advocates asking for Kenneth to be released."" And Jackson told CNN that he has written to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to request a face-to-face meeting ""to make a humanitarian plea to him."" ""He is repentant and has been contrite, and we hope for forgiveness,"" Jackson said of Bae. In Washington, Harf told reporters that the State Department ""certainly"" supports Jackson's effort. 'I have not lost hope' Bae operated a China-based company specializing in tours of North Korea, according to family members, who have described him as a devout Christian. He was transferred to a hospital last year after his health deteriorated. But last week the United States said he had been moved back to a labor camp, a development his family described as ""devastating."" In the video, Bae asks the Swedish diplomat to tell his family that ""I have not lost hope and have not given up anything."" But says he is concerned that if his situation isn't resolved soon, it could ""drag on"" for months longer. He notes that annual U.S.-South Korean military drills due to start later this month may deepen tensions in the region, as they did last year. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki on Sunday expressed disappointment that King's visit was called off and noted North Korea had said it wouldn't use Bae as a ""political bargaining chip."" It is the second time North Korea has canceled a planned visit by King. Psaki said that the joint military exercises are ""in no way linked to Mr. Bae's case."" North Korea has been urging the South not to take part in the drills -- a call that Seoul and Washington have rejected. Jackson said he hoped a visit would break ""that cycle of terror and fear and irritation"" between the two countries. Life in the camp . In the conversation Friday, Bae discusses details of his health problems, as well as the minutiae of life in the labor camp. He says he is suffering from back pain and neck pain, making the eight hours of manual labor he does each day ""very difficult."" ""I've been working with my hands a lot,"" Bae tells the diplomat. ""My hands all got numb and sore. I have some cuts."" But he says that he remains ""strong mentally and spiritually, and I am trying to stay strong emotionally as well."" Bae tells the diplomat that he has access to books and television at the camp and that the staff there treat him ""very fairly."" The TV antenna stopped working for a couple of weeks recently, he says, allowing him to spend ""more time with the Lord, with the Bible."" ""That was actually a pretty good time for me,"" Bae says. Sweden represents U.S. interests in North Korea because the United States has no diplomatic presence in the secretive state. ""We again call on the (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) to grant Bae special amnesty and immediate release as a humanitarian gesture so he may reunite with his family and seek medical care,"" Psaki said Sunday. ""We will continue to work actively to secure Mr. Bae's release.""","Bae's sister says family is ""really discouraged"" by his move back to a labor camp .

"(CNN) -- With her signature Friday on Senate Bill 1070, Gov. Jan Brewer launched Arizona into a maelstrom of national controversy, community conflict and extreme fiscal risk. In doing so, she failed a basic test of courageous leadership -- recognizing and acting responsibly when political symbolism and populist pandering crosses into dangerous policy. The governor should have known better, if only because recent history demonstrates the folly in enacting measures like Arizona's SB 1070. SB 1070 will be subject to multiple legal challenges, and the state will devote precious resources to defend a law that has so many serious constitutional flaws that it will likely never be implemented. The neighboring state of California faced this circumstance 15 years ago when Gov. Pete Wilson championed Proposition 187, enacted by voters in November 1994. Over half a dozen lawsuits were on file within days of the law's passage. A federal court soon enjoined all but two minor sections of the initiative, and the vast bulk of the law never took effect. Yet, California not only paid a lot of state lawyers to defend these suits -- and ultimately paid much of the plaintiffs' attorneys' fees as well -- but also had to divert bureaucrats throughout state government from their other tasks to analyze and plan how to implement a law that could never be implemented. Today, California could certainly use the tens of millions of dollars expended so many years ago vainly defending Proposition 187. Moreover, even though Proposition 187 was never implemented, California suffered other repercussions besides the waste of limited state financial resources. Community conflict increased as some interpreted the initiative's passage as license for private individuals to harass and interrogate those they believed to be undocumented, which then, as now, was usually based on racial stereotype. In addition, support of Proposition 187 did not help Pete Wilson's political career, as naturalizations rose and an increasing number of angry Latino voters mobilized to oppose the governor and the political party that championed such a negative initiative. Today, so many years later, the political sins of Wilson continue to be visited upon the heads of California politicians from his political party. Coincidentally, Arizona's SB 1070 suffers from many of the same constitutional flaws as California's Proposition 187. In particular, the claim that felled the California initiative applies in even greater measure to the Arizona bill. The federal court struck down Proposition 187 as an unconstitutional attempt to regulate immigration, which is a role that belongs exclusively to the federal government. SB 1070 is an even more direct attempt to establish the state's own immigration law and enforcement scheme. Indeed, what we have seen since Friday is the usual pivot by those who propose and support unconstitutional laws like SB 1070. Sen. Russell Pearce and others who support the bill are now arguing it does nothing but reiterate existing federal law and that the law is legitimate because police officers always had ""inherent authority"" to enforce federal immigration law. Their assertions are dubious as a legal matter because of the very weak support for the ""inherent authority"" notion and because, in the area of immigration, the states lack even the right to duplicate federal law word-for-word. Beyond this, I am certain that neither Sen. Pearce nor Gov. Brewer would actually go into their next election campaigns asserting they expended significant time and state resources on a bill that does nothing to change existing law and authority. They and other proponents have at various times maintained, in more or less blatant contradiction of their rhetorical defense of the law's constitutional propriety, that SB 1070 is a much-needed change in current law that will strengthen Arizona. In fact, the pre-enactment characterization more accurately reflects the bill's effects: SB 1070 would dramatically change every Arizonan's daily experience, especially anyone whose appearance, name, language or accent fits the stereotype of the undocumented. It is this invitation or direction to police to engage in racial profiling, together with the state's unconstitutional attempt to regulate immigration, that makes it unlikely that SB 1070 can ever be implemented. Nonetheless, Arizona will experience extreme and dire consequences, just as California experienced a decade-and-a-half ago. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Thomas A. Saenz.","New immigration law follows in footsteps of California's Prop. 187, says Thomas Saenz .

"The mother of a Georgia toddler who died in a sweltering SUV emphatically told a crowd at her son's funeral she loves and stands by her husband, even though he was charged with murder in the child's death. ""Am I angry with Ross?"" Leanna Harris said at the funeral in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. ""Absolutely not.  It has never crossed my mind.  Ross is and was and will be, if we have more children, a wonderful father. Ross is a wonderful daddy and leader for our household. Cooper meant the world to him."" This was the first time she's spoken publicly since June 18, when her husband, Justin Ross Harris, was charged with murder and second-degree child cruelty in the death of his son, Cooper Harris. He has pleaded not guilty. Police said Harris, 33, told them he forgot to drop his 22-month-old son at the day-care center before going to work. The boy died after spending seven hours in a child safety seat in the back of an SUV. Suspect speaks to funeral by phone . Earlier in the funeral service at University Church of Christ, Harris called from the Cobb County Jail outside Atlanta, where he's being held without bond, and addressed the crowd by speaker phone. He wasn't allowed to leave the jail for the funeral. ""Thank you for everything you've done for my boy,"" he said. ""Good life. (Inaudible) No words to say. Just horrible. (Inaudible) I'm just sorry I can't be there."" Then Leanna Harris spoke. ""First of all Ross, I love you and I'm doing this for you, OK?"" she said. ""Two years ago when we welcomed a 6-pound, 8-ounce perfect baby into the world, this never crossed my mind."" Child 'was perfect' Leanna Harris said she worried about not being able to have a child and was joyous when Cooper was born. The couple had been married since 2006. ""He was perfect, and he is perfect,"" she said of Cooper. ""He changed mine and Ross' life. I've talked to you about the magnitude in which he changed it.  As children do, he turned our lives upside down. ... I wouldn't trade it for the world."" The last two nights of Cooper's life, he had trouble sleeping and ended up in bed between her and her husband, Leanna Harris said. ""I remember turning over in the middle of the night, his mouth was open and his full toddler lips just breathing right into my face,"" she said.  ""I will cherish that moment forever."" 'The Lord is holding me up' Religion has helped her and her husband cope during this stressful time, she said. Police released search warrants showing that Ross Harris searched the Internet for information on child deaths in hot vehicles. The international media scrutinized the couple's life. ""Some of you might wonder how I'm even standing here today. I wonder that myself, and I asked myself that question over and over the last week,"" she said. ""I should be crumpled into a heap of snot and tears into the dirt, but the Lord is holding me up right now. He is holding Ross up. And he is holding both of us up when we can't hold ourselves up.""

"The Department of Justice is investigating the death of Alfred Wright, a physical therapist who disappeared and died under mysterious circumstances in an isolated section of Texas, U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee said Monday. Wright, 28, a resident of Jasper, Texas, was last seen alive November 7 when he stopped at a liquor store because he was having trouble with his pickup truck. He was on his way to treat a patient. Local law enforcement authorities searched but gave up. His family found his partially clothed body 19 days later in an area that officers had supposedly searched. Adding more confusion, a medical examiner said the death was accidental, but a different pathologist hired by the family said there appeared to be ""severe trauma"" to the body. The federal investigation comes after reporting by CNN into the case. Lee, a Democrat who represents the 18th District of Texas, announced the investigation in a Monday press release. It wasn't immediately clear from the Justice Department when or how it will proceed with the investigation. Family members said Wright, married and the father of two young sons, called from the CL&M Grocery on Route 87, asking someone to pick him up because of problems with his truck. When they arrived, he was gone. The next day, Wright's personal effects, including his watch and ID, turned up on a nearby ranch but the search for him turned up nothing. Family members say the sheriff told them ""there was no foul play"" and that Wright's disappearance was probably drug-related. Family and friends kept searching. When found, Wright was wearing only boxer shorts, tennis shoes and a single sock, inside of which was his cell phone. Wright was missing an ear, two front teeth, and his tongue. His throat appeared to be cut. The medical examiner attributed the trauma to ""animal and insect activity."" The coroner's toxicology report described Wright's body as filled with drugs -- cocaine, methamphetamine -- and his death was ruled accidental due to a ""combined drug intoxication."" Family members said they never saw Wright do drugs. The family hired their own pathologist, who did a separate autopsy that found what appeared to be ""severe trauma to the neck and head."" The Sabine County Sheriff's Department handed the investigation over to the Texas Rangers, who announced they had called in the FBI to assist.

"There's no way for us to know exactly what happened some 13.8 billion years ago, when our universe burst onto the scene. But  scientists announced Monday a breakthrough in understanding how our world as we know it came to be. If the discovery holds up to scrutiny, it's evidence of how the universe rapidly expanded less than a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang. ""It teaches us something crucial about how our universe began,"" said Sean Carroll, a physicist at California Institute of Technology, who was not involved in the study. ""It's an amazing achievement that we humans, doing science systematically for just a few hundred years, can extend our understanding that far."" What's more, researchers discovered direct evidence for the first time of what Albert Einstein predicted in his general theory of relativity: Gravitational waves. These are essentially ripples in space-time, which have been thought of as the ""first tremors of the Big Bang,"" according to the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. A telescope at the South Pole called BICEP2 -- Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization 2 -- was critical to the discovery. The telescope allowed scientists to analyze the polarization of light left over from the early universe, leading to Monday's landmark announcement. How inflation works . Scientists use the word ""inflation"" to describe how the universe rapidly expanded after the Big Bang in a ripping-apart of space. The BICEP2 results are the ""smoking gun for inflation,"" Marc Kamionkowski, professor of physics and astronomy, said at a news conference. Kamionkowski also was not involved in the project. ""Inflation is the theory about the 'bang' of Big Bang,"" said  Chao-Lin Kuo, an assistant professor of physics at Stanford and SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, and a co-leader of the BICEP2 collaboration, in a Stanford video. ""It explains why we have all this stuff in the universe."" Imagine that you are making a raisin bun, said Stanford physicist Kent Irwin, who worked on sensors and readout systems used in the experiment. As the dough bakes and expands, the distance from any given raisin to another increases. ""Certainly everything in the universe that we see now, at one time before inflation, was smaller than an electron,"" Irwin said. ""And then it expanded during inflation at faster than the speed of light."" You may have learned in physics class that light sets the universe's speed limit, but space-time is an exception; it can stretch faster than the speed of light, Irwin said. Stanford University professor Andrei Linde, who helped develop the current inflation theory, said the new results are something he had hoped to see for 30 years. ""If this is true, this is a moment of understanding of nature of such a magnitude that it just overwhelms and let's just hope that it's not a trick,"" Linde said in a university video interview. Another cool tidbit: Inflation can be used in theories that suggest the existence of multiple universes, Irwin said, although these results do not directly address such theories. What are gravitational waves? Scientists believe that in the fabric of space-time, there are tiny ripples called quantum fluctuations. If you could look at space-time on the smallest scale possible, you would, in theory, see them, even today. Unfortunately, no microscope is capable of seeing something that small. Such fluctuations also existed at the beginning of the universe. Inflation blew them up much larger, launching gravitational waves that we now see imprinted on the cosmic microwave background. ""These gravitational waves are an aftershock of the Big Bang,"" he said. The BICEP2 study is the first to image them directly. ""We have for the first time a detection for the mythical gravity wave signal that people have been searching for so hard, for so long,"" said Clem Pryke, associate professor at the University of Minnesota, at a press conference Monday. Other experiments such as LIGO -- Caltech's Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory -- are also looking for proof of gravitational waves, but in the context of energetic cosmic phenomena such as coalescing black holes. The gravitational waves suggested by the BICEP2 results would have expanded across the entire universe at that time, Irwin said. The length of one of these waves -- the distance between peaks and troughs -- would have been billions of light years across. Light from the early universe, called cosmic microwave background radiation, reveals these telltale signs of our universe's history. Last year, scientists from the European Space Agency's Planck space telescope released a detailed map of temperature variations in this light, which came from from about 380,000 years after the Big Bang. Better 'baby picture' of universe emerges . Instead of temperature,  BICEP2 scientists were looking specifically at the polarization of the cosmic microwave background -- that is, the direction the electric field is pointing across the sky. Researchers were looking for a specific type of polarization called ""B-modes,"" which signify a curling pattern in the polarized orientations of light from the ancient universe, said Jamie Bock, co-leader of the BICEP2 collaboration and professor of physics at California Institute of Technology. In theory, this swirling polarization pattern could only be created from gravitational waves. And that is what BICEP2 found. ""It's a very clean signature of those gravity waves,"" Irwin said. Is it for real? Because of how potentially important these results are, they must be viewed with skepticism, said David Spergel, professor of astrophysics at Princeton University. The measurement is a very difficult one to make and could easily be contaminated. There are, as it stands, some ""oddities"" in the results that could be concerning, he said. ""I am looking forward to seeing these results confirmed or refuted by other experiments in the next year or two,"" Spergel said. The Planck space telescope collaboration is expected to release results on polarization of the cosmic microwave background as well, Irwin said. Other experiments are working toward similar goals, which could support or go against BICEP2. Regardless, Monday's announcement is making big waves in the scientific community.

"Three days after Hillary Clinton said businesses don't create jobs, she cleaned up the remark, part of a critique of trickle-down economics, explaining she had ""shorthanded this point the other day."" Friday at a campaign rally for Massachusetts Democratic gubernatorial candidate Martha Coakley, the former secretary of state told the crowd, ""Don't let anybody tell you that it's corporations and businesses that create jobs,"" going on to say trickle-down economics ""has failed rather spectacularly."" Republicans seized on the sentence, seemingly made for an anti-Hillary Clinton campaign ad. America Rising, the main anti-Clinton super-PAC, is featuring it on the header of its website. On Monday at a campaign event for New York Rep. Sean Maloney, a former aide to President Bill Clinton, Clinton went for a do-over, saying, ""Let me be absolutely clear about what I've been saying for a couple of decades: Our economy grows when businesses and entrepreneurs create good-paying jobs here in an America where workers and families are empowered to build from the bottom up and the middle out -- not when we hand out tax breaks for corporations that outsource jobs or stash their profits overseas."" It's the second time Clinton has struggled to speak fluently in the economic vernacular of her party. In early June, during her book tour, Clinton made a major gaffe when she said, ""We came out of the White House not only dead broke, but in debt,"" a comment that critics cited as evidence she is out of touch with everyday Americans. 7 things Hillary Clinton says at almost every speech . Her comment that businesses don't create jobs stood out even more at an event where Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a populist poster child, also spoke. Though Clinton has not committed to a presidential run in 2016, she is far and away the front-runner in polls and her comments are analyzed as if she's a candidate. Her quick cleanup of the comments reflects concern about the potential for lasting damage from missteps while discussing economic issues, a pitfall that helped sink Mitt Romney's run for the presidency in 2012. ""I'm not concerned about the very poor. ... I'm concerned about the heart of America, the 95% of Americans who are right now struggling,"" Romney, then a candidate, said in February 2012. Democrats seized on those remarks as out of touch. Republicans were chagrined Romney didn't talk about economically boosting all Americans. Later, in September 2012, once Romney was the Republican nominee, a recording of him speaking at a closed fundraiser was leaked to the media. In it he was heard saying, ""There are 47% of the people who will vote for the President no matter what,"" describing those voters as ""dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it.""","Clinton: ""Don't let anybody tell you that it's corporations and businesses that create jobs""

"""Affluenza."" The word touched a national nerve. But G. Dick Miller, the psychologist who said it, wishes he could take it back. ""I wish I hadn't used that term. Everyone seems to have hooked onto it,"" he told CNN's ""Anderson Copper 360"" on Thursday night. ""We used to call these people spoiled brats."" Miller recently testified on behalf of 16-year-old Ethan Couch, who this week was sentenced to 10 years' probation for driving drunk and causing a crash that killed four people. Miller told the court the teen's parents should share part of the blame for the crash because they never set limits for the boy and gave him everything he wanted, according to CNN affiliate WFAA. Couch is himself a victim -- of ""affluenza"" -- the psychologist said, suggesting the teen's life could be turned around with treatment and no contact with his parents. 'Affluenza': Is it real? A judge, at least in part, appears to have agreed. Couch was given no jail time, though he could face up to 10 years behind bars if he violates the terms of his probation. Prosecutors had asked for the maximum of 20 years. The judge's decision stunned victims' family members, who say they feel Couch basically got away with murder. ""Let's face it. ... There needs to be some justice here,"" Eric Boyles, who lost his wife and daughter, told ""Anderson Cooper 360."" On the night of June 15, his wife, Hollie Boyles, and daughter, Shelby, left their home to help Breanna Mitchell, whose SUV had broken down. Brian Jennings, a youth pastor, was driving past and also stopped to help. All four were killed when the teen's pickup plowed into the pedestrians on a road in Burleson, south of Fort Worth. Couch's vehicle also struck a parked car, which then slid into another vehicle headed in the opposite direction. Two people riding in the bed of the teen's pickup were tossed in the crash and severely injured. One is no longer able to move or talk because of a brain injury, while the other suffered internal injuries and broken bones. According to prosecutors, three hours after the crash, tests showed Couch had a blood alcohol content of 0.24, three times the legal limit. ""There are absolutely no consequences for what occurred that day,"" said Boyles. ""The primary message has to absolutely be that money and privilege can't buy justice in this country -- that it's not OK to drink and drive and kill four people ... and not have any consequences to that. That's not the American dream that we grew up to participate in."" Couch was sentenced by a juvenile judge Tuesday. Judge Jean Boyd told the court she would not release the teen to his parents, but would work to find Couch a long-term treatment facility. According to WFAA, defense attorneys asked that Couch be sent to a small, private facility in California. They reportedly said the teen's father would pay the $450,000 price tag. ""There is nothing the judge could have done to lessen the suffering for any of those families,"" said defense attorney Scott Brown, CNN affiliate KTVT reported. ""(The judge) fashioned a sentence that is going to keep Ethan under the thumb of the justice system for the next 10 years,"" he said. ""And if Ethan doesn't do what he's supposed to do, if he has one misstep at all, then this judge, or an adult judge when he's transferred, can then incarcerate him.""","Ethan Couch gets 10 years' probation for driving drunk, killing 4 .

"(CNN) -- Long before there was Apple there was Olivetti. With its slick, beautifully designed products at the cutting edge of innovation, the Italian company was once at the forefront of the race to produce a personal computer for mass consumption. The Ivrea based manufacturer spent years honing the design of its typewriters, calculators and adding machines, agonising over everything from the position of the keys to the shape of the space bar. And everyone from Cormac McCarthy to Bob Dylan used an Olivetti typewriter to bang out some of the world's best known novels and songs. While the company has never recovered its leading position, a humble start-up aims to put Ivrea back on the world innovation and design map. Open-source hardware . Called Arduino, after the local bar where the five founders met to discuss their project, the company produces simple open-source electronics platforms that allows enthusiasts and professionals to build interactive projects. Now, almost ten years after the company produced its first single-board microcontroller, more than 700,000 are in the hands of hobbyists and professionals, operating everything from drones and robots to lights and motors. Co-founder David Cuartielles told CNN that Arduino is not only an educational tool, but also a way of exploring new ideas with new people. ""It's been an emerging phenomenon since the late 1990s,"" Cuartielles said. ""Different schools around the world have tried to bring electronics to designers and artists to get them to come up with more creative uses for technology."" Arduino boards also have a distinctive and striking design, in recognition of which they will go on display at MoMA in New York in 2015. Olivetti roots . Operating from a part of the old Olivetti building in Ivrea, Arduino stamps out the blue microprocessors which operate under a form of open source that allows amateurs, designers and artists to come up with new uses for the circuit board. Cuartielles explained that when they launched the project, the only thing the team wanted to protect was the brand. Its use or misuse (one reason the boards have a robust construction and retail for less than US$50) is entirely in the public domain under a creative commons license. As a microprocessor for controlling sensors, Arduino is unparalleled and is becoming a common feature of the prototyping phase of many start-ups. ""I wouldn't be risking very much if I said that a lot of the products you see on Kickstarter use Arduino boards in the prototyping phase to control various aspects of the project,"" he said. He said one of the most interesting applications has been the development of the open platform ArduSat mission, which for the first time allow the general public to run their own space-based applications. ""You will be able to rent a timeslot to manipulate the machine so you can simulate your experiment on land with an Arduino board and you can simulate it in space on the satellite,"" he said. Putting the pieces together . One of the more surprising applications has been the natural marriage between the Arduino board and Lego. Once seen only as a child's building block toy, Lego is finding startling utility as an instant mechanical prototype maker for Arduino ideas. ""Lego is very interesting in a sense that it provides mechanical access to the world. It lets you build almost anything within some constraints -- you can't, for instance, build something that's perfectly round with Lego. ""Arduino is at the same level but with electronics. It allows you to control things at a low level really, really well."" But in the face of ever more sophisticated technology, keeping Arduino simple is no easy feat. ""The more simple you make it for the user, the more complex it becomes at the back end,"" Cuartilles said. ""For example, the Arduino Yun -- one of our latest products --basically allows you to connect anything to WiFi or anything to the ethernet. ""It can control it at a low level on the net or on the cloud but to make it easy for the users we had to imbed a whole Linux computer into it at that size. ""The complexity in the stomach of the beast just gets bigger."" While Arduino is most closely associated with robotics, Cuartielles said the application of electronics goes far beyond a concept of robotics, which he says has not changed dramatically over the past 70 years. ""For example, they have discovered that 3D printing lab parts makes them sterile by definition. You can 3D print a test tube to put micro-organisms in and that will be sterile because it is being produced by a plastic that must be heated to 250 degrees Celsius. ""For â‚¬1.000, you can have a machine capable of making sterile lab equipment. That is super cheap and can help laboratories and hospitals all around the world.""","Arduino, the open source electronic hardware, hails from Ivrea, the home of Olivetti .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- An amateur league of ill-trained rebel fighters appears to be on the brink of toppling Moammar Gadhafi's 42-year rule after reportedly capturing two of the leader's sons and infiltrating the Libyan capital. But in a possible indication that the fight is not over, celebrations in Tripoli's Green Square -- renamed Martyrs' Square by the rebels -- gave way to tension Monday morning after rebels told CNN that they'd heard Gadhafi army forces were heading their way. CNN could not confirm any movement of Gadhafi forces. The uncertainty came hours after a rebel official said two of Moammar Gadhafi's sons -- Saif al-Islam and Saadi -- had been arrested by opposition forces. Jumma Ibrahim, a rebel spokesman based in Libya's western mountain region, said both were captured in Tripoli. International Criminal Court chief prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo said the court plans Monday to contact authorities associated with those holding Saif al-Islam to try to arrange for his transfer to the Netherlands for an eventual trial for ""crimes against humanity."" The court, based in The Hague, issued an arrest warrant earlier this summer for Saif Gadhafi as well as his father and his uncle Abdullah al-Sanussi. Saadi Gadhafi, a businessman and onetime professional soccer player, helped set up an April CNN interview with a woman who claimed she'd been raped by government troops. He later told CNN that those behind the attack should be prosecuted. There was no immediate reaction from Libyan government officials to the reports of the sons' arrests. In an audio address broadcast just before midnight Sunday, Moammar Gadhafi claimed ""very small groups of people who are collaborators with the imperialists"" were fighting inside the capital. Should the rebels prevail, Gadhafi said NATO would not protect them and predicted massive bloodshed. To prevent such bloodshed, he said, Libyans, including women, should go out and fight. ""Get out and lead, lead, lead the people to paradise,"" he said. Just after midnight Sunday, scores of raucous rebel supporters packed Green Square -- the same place where Gadhafi loyalists have congregated regularly -- celebrating, waving the rebel flag and even flashing the ""victory"" sign. NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said Sunday that ""the Gadhafi regime is clearly crumbling,"" and urged the leader to acknowledge defeat. ""The rebel fighters are in control of most of the neighborhoods in Tripoli,"" said Ibrahim, the rebel spokesman. A main supply route into western Tripoli that had been the scene of intense fighting was clear early Monday, occupied only by rebels heading toward the capital. CNN's Sara Sidner reported around 3 a.m. that the route heading to Green Square was ""eerily quiet,"" with cars passing by checkpoints run by opposition loyalists. Between 100 and 150 rebel fighters by then had gathered in the square, only to scatter an hour later amid concerns about possible snipers and an upcoming battle there, in the heart of the city. The advance included members of the ""Tripoli Brigade,"" a group of rebel troops who'd once lived in the capital and could help navigate the city. But they weren't all professional soldiers, such as one IT worker who hadn't held a gun before joining the movement a few months ago. They entered a city that, after being largely free of large-scale fighting since the conflict began six months ago, became the site of intense drama and significant violence over the weekend. Libyan government spokesman Musa Ibrahim told reporters just after 11 p.m. Sunday that about 1,300 people had been killed and about 5,000 wounded in fighting in the previous 12 hours. ""(The city) is being turned into a hellfire,"" he said. The spokesman denied a report from Arab-language news network Al-Arabiya that Gadhafi's guard had surrendered, calling it ""false information."" In another sign of possible trouble for the regime, the signal for state-run television -- which has long been a forum for pro-Gadhafi views -- repeatedly froze, with the station later claiming there had been ""interference"" due to a ""hostile media campaign."" The network reverted to taped broadcasts of previous pro-Gadhafi gatherings. A fierce gun battle broke out Sunday evening near the hotel where many international reporters were stationed in Tripoli. Many government officials packed their suitcases and left the hotel earlier in the day. A woman in Tripoli said late Sunday that she and others went outside, ""screaming"" and calling for Gadhafi's ouster -- and had plenty of company. ""We realized that no one wants him, no one wants this dictator,"" said the resident, whom CNN is not naming for safety reasons. Musa Ibrahim told CNN on Sunday that ""more than 65,000 professional men"" are fighting in Tripoli, with thousands more flooding in to help defend the regime, and added they ""can hold for much longer."" He predicted a ""humanitarian disaster"" unless an immediate ceasefire is called. ""It's not about who will win,"" he said. ""The world needs to hear this message, that a massacre will be committed in Tripoli if one side wins now."" Some areas of eastern Tripoli, including the suburb of Tajoura, were out of government control Sunday, according to a Libyan government official who asked not to be named. Rebels set car tires afire along barricades there, the official said. Meanwhile, Zawiya -- a key coastal city about 30 miles west of the capital -- appeared under rebel control, with celebratory gunfire and fireworks as some yelled out, ""Libya is free!"" Aref Ali Nayed, an ambassador in the United Arab Emirates for the Libyan rebels' Transitional National Council, said that opposition forces were calling Sunday ""Day 1."" ""The reason we declare it 'Day 1' is because we feel Gadhafi is already finished. He is already finished, most importantly, in our hearts,"" he said. ""We no longer fear him."" Ibrahim, the government spokesman, blamed NATO for the conflict and appealed for a cease-fire. ""Every drop of Libyan blood shed by these rebels is the responsibility of the Western world, especially NATO's countries,"" he said. ""We hold (U.S. President Barack) Obama, (British Prime Minister David) Cameron and (French President Nicolas) Sarkozy morally responsible for every single unnecessary death that takes place in this country."" Several U.S. officials -- including President Barack Obama, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton -- were getting updates on the situation, officials said. ""Tonight, the momentum against the Gadhafi regime has reached a tipping point,"" Obama said in a statement, claiming ""Tripoli is slipping from the grasp of a tyrant. ... The surest way for the bloodshed to end is simple: Moammar Gadhafi and his regime need to recognize that their rule has come to an end."" In the rebel hub of Benghazi, meanwhile, CNN iReporter Sammi Addahoumi showed video of large, boisterous crowds in the city's Freedom Square reacting as reports of the developments played on a large screen. ""The spirits are quite high,"" said Addahoumi, a 28-year-old deli manager from South Carolina who said his father fled Benghazi decades ago. ""Everyone is expecting Tripoli to fall."" In the first of his speeches on state television Sunday, though, Gadhafi was still insisting the rebels -- whom he described as ""infidels,"" ""traitors"" and ""gangsters"" -- would fail and vowed not to back down.

"With another investigation yielding no direct ties between Gov. Chris Christie and the George Washington Bridge scandal, critics are questioning the purpose of continuing the Democratic-led probe, when yet a third investigation — run by the U.S. Attorney's Office — is also ongoing. Former Gov. Tom Kean, a widely esteemed figure in New Jersey politics who co-chaired the commission that investigated the 9/11 attacks, is accusing the state legislative committee of partisanship and acting in a ""purely political"" fashion. ""I know something about nonpartisan investigations, this isn't one,"" the Republican told CNN. ""I'm disappointed."" Democrat John Wisniewski, co-chairman of the panel, confirmed that they haven't determined whether the New Jersey governor knew about the lane closures ahead of time. But he's vowing to continue the committee's work until more questions are answered. The findings — set to be released in a report Monday and obtained by CNN's Chris Frates — fall in line so far with a review conducted by Christie's administration earlier this year, in the sense that both have found no wrongdoing on the part of the governor. Meanwhile, U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman is still conducting a federal probe into the incident, where lanes to the nation's busiest bridge were closed for alleged political reasons, causing major traffic gridlock in the town of Fort Lee, New Jersey for four days in September 2013. Kean, who was once a mentor for Christie, had a falling out with the governor after Christie's re-election, and as the news about the bridge scandal made national headlines in January, Kean issued sharp criticism about the Republican governor. He openly questioned Christie's leadership skills in an interview with the Washington Post, and told the New Yorker's Ryan Lizza that Christie managed a culture of intimidation within his administration. Kean on Friday was hesitant to offer his views about Christie's personality or reputation, only revealing, ""I don't see it the way I once did."" The two have made amends this year, and Kean said Christie asks him for advice ""every now and then."" ""We've had our differences and we still don't agree on everything,"" he conceded, before shifting his comments back to the committee's investigation. Kean freely admits that he thought the scandal merited investigation from the outset, saying there was a ""tremendous number of questions"" when the news broke. But he's frustrated with how the Democratic-led committee has run the investigation so far. The makeup of the committee consisted of four Republicans and eight Democrats, including the two co-chairs, Wisniewski and Senate Majority Leader Loretta Weinberg. Republicans complain that they weren't granted equal participation in the investigation, saying they had no say in the selection of legal counsel for the probe, nor in the selection of witnesses or the private interviewing of witnesses. The committee hired former Assistant U.S. Attorney Reid Schar of Illinois, the same prosecutor that went after former Illinois Democratic Gov. Rod Blagojevich. The internal probe launched by Christie's own administration — which cost taxpayers millions of dollars -- was also not a truly bipartisan effort, Kean acknowledged. But that probe, he continued, ""never pretended to be anything except for what it was,"" and ""when you're accused of a criminal act as governor, you got to spend time on it. You don't have much choice."" Asked if the legislative committee should end its investigation, Kean said, ""I think they should have stopped a long time ago."" ""If they're going to continue, they should just do it right,"" he said. ""They should bring in the Republicans."" Republican Assemblywoman Holly Schepisi said there's been ""grave concerns regarding the impartiality"" since the committee was formed earlier this year, referencing complaints about participation. Her grievances, however, are nothing new; Republicans frequently registered their complaints during public hearings this year. The committee, she argued, has been languishing. ""We have done absolutely nothing for months upon months. We have received no communications from our chair since this summer,"" Schepisi said. ""I don't see what else there that we're expected to do here."" A Democratic member, Assemblywoman Valerie Huttle, disagreed that the committee was partisan and felt that she ""was treated the same as (her) colleague across the aisle"" in terms of having access to the panel's lawyers and to documents released by the co-chairs. She acknowledged that Democratic members were not privy to private interviews of witnesses but said ""we let them have the flexibility,"" referring to the counsel selected by committee leadership. As for whether or not she thinks the probe should continue, Huttle said the committee should ""regroup"" and find a consensus on Monday. For his part, Wisniewski fiercely hit back at accusations of partisanship and pledged that the committee would march on with its work. ""The investigation was run in a fair-and-even handed fashion,"" he told CNN. He denied that he was part of the leak of the latest report, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, and said the legal firm was chosen out of state ""so no one could allege there was a political tie"" to a local law firm. ""I have the highest respects for Governor Kean, but I believe the information he's acting on inaccurate information,"" he said. The probe, he continued, has been limited due to a lack of access to witnesses who are also being asked to cooperate in the federal probe. Their testimony could help the panel come to a more conclusive finding, he said, stressing that the report set to be released on Monday still shows uncertainty about what the governor knew and didn't know. The report also details that a top adviser to Christie, Regina Egea, and the governor exchanged multiple text messages about the bridge scandal in 2013 during preliminary hearings about the traffic jam. Egea, however, had testified to the panel earlier this year that she only sent him one text message and deleted it. The discrepancy is one of the questions that still needs to be answered, Wisniewski said. He argued that the Republican backlash over the committee's work is ""their only recourse"" to criticize the process. ""Let's face it: it's partisan sniping because this is an embarrassing episode for the Republican Party in which a high ranking member of the governor's staff, for clearly political reasons, closed lanes leading to George Washington Bridge, creating not only a public safety nightmare but just traffic gridlock for an entire community for four days,"" he said. As for why the committee should continue on top of the U.S. Attorney's probe, he said the legislature has a ""constitutional role"" to conduct oversight of the administration and make sure a similar scenario doesn't happen again. And national Democrats aren't letting this go either. Michael Czin, press secretary for the Democratic National Committee, said the report's findings still show a side of Christie that could damage his 2016 presidential aspirations. ""Some of Christie's closest aides and allies put public safety at risk, seemingly to exact petty political revenge, and in the aftermath, they lied about it,"" he said in a written statement. ""That, in itself, is inexcusable conduct coming from the administration of someone who wants to be President of the United States.""","Former Gov.

"(CNN) -- Lost amidst the predictable clutter of the ""will-he-or won't-she"" questions about whether Jeb Bush or Hillary Clinton will actually run for the presidency is an unexpected development: a hint of authenticity. Turns out that political purgatory—even if temporary—can actually spark a genuine conversation with the public about what it takes to be president, and what goes into deciding whether you want to run. Here's Hillary on herself: ""The job is unforgiving in many ways, so I think you need people around you who will kid you, make fun of you. ... You can lose touch with what's real, what's authentic."" Here's Jeb on his decision: ""Can I do it where the sacrifice to my family is tolerable?...It's a pretty ugly business right now. There's a level under which I would never subjugate my family because that's my organizing principle. That's my life."" So while Chris Christie won't answer questions about immigration and Ted Cruz is threatening to block presidential nominations and Rand Paul is blaming the tragic Eric Garner death on cigarette taxes, there's another more personal and revealing conversation going on about the presidency and how to get there, and we ought to pay some attention. Not just because it's coming from Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton, although that is a part of it. After all, Hillary's outside support network is up and running, even if she isn't officially yet. And while Jeb has no campaign infrastructure or organization, his closest advisers are having enough meetings with enough operatives to send enough signals that it's a very live, real, even likely, possibility. Though Jeb's advisers tell me he hasn't made a decision, the process over the last six months sure looks like it leads to a presidential campaign. So all the cheerleaders need is the final hand signal. Which brings us back to the Jeb and Hillary conversations. They're thinking out loud, in a way, which hardly ever happens in politics anymore because it usually gets you into trouble. (See: Joe Biden.) But they're both doing it because their decisions about running for the presidency come from places of deep family experience. Hillary lived in the White House. Jeb visited his brother and his father there. They get it -- at all levels. They understand the power and nature of the job. They also understand the ""what-it-takes"" component to run for it. And, in a way, they've both got similar problems: They're each practiced politicians, but they're not the best transactional pols in their families. They each have problems with their party's activist base. And they both can seem like old news. It's that dynasty thing. But wait. Maybe all that stuff actually prepares a candidate for the campaign, and maybe even for the job itself. Clinton's ruminations about decision-making, for instance, are refreshing. ""Technology connects you around the world instantaneously, so you're constantly being asked for opinions, to make decisions that maybe you need some time to think about,"" she told a Boston audience on Thursday. ""Maybe you need some time to sleep on it. Maybe you need to bring in some people to talk about it. But the pace of demands is so intense that you feel like you've got to respond."" It's the stress, she said. ""Here's what I worry about. The stress on anybody in a leadership position, multiplied many times over to be president. The incoming never ends."" It's a much more honest assessment than talking about the tug of being a grandmother. As for Jeb Bush, in addition to the personal issues, he's given a big hint he gets that he's not aligned with the base of his party in some states—and that's fine. In a recent appearance before a Wall Street Journal CEO conference, he said the GOP nominee needs to be willing to ""lose the primary to win the general (election) without violating your principles."" Could he possibly be talking about Mitt Romney circa 2012? Or his own problems with the party base on immigration and school reform? My guess: Both. I'm also guessing this: What we are hearing from both of these politicians are part of the larger conversation they're having with themselves. As in: Do I need this? Can I do this? Is it worth it to me—and important enough to the country—for me to spend two years on this? These are not wannabes. They've been there, in the heat, in one way or another. So while the subordinates plan, organize and recruit, the actual deciders continue to decide. It's getting down to the wire, and they know it. You can hear it. And it may be the most genuine stuff we hear for the next two years.","Gloria Borger: Jeb Bush, Hillary Clinton talking authentically about demands of presidency .

"(CNN) -- A giant menorah will light the sky above New York on Wednesday to mark the start of Hanukkah, a Jewish holiday celebrated for eight days and nights. Jews celebrate Hanukkah by lighting candles each night in a menorah, an eight-branch candelabra with a ninth, elevated branch known as a shamash. Organizers will light the first candle of what they called the world's largest menorah at Central Park. Lighting of the menorah will be held at 5:30 p.m. daily through December 8. The 32-foot high, gold-colored, 4,000 pound steel structure features genuine oil lamps, according to organizers. It has glass chimneys to protect the lights from strong winds. The menorah marks Hanukkah, the Jewish Festival of Lights that mostly falls in December. ""The menorah stands as a symbol of freedom and democracy, strength and inspiration, delivering a timely and poignant message to each person on an individual basis,"" said Rabbi Shmuel M. Butman, director Lubavitch Youth Organization. The shamash, which is lit first, is used to light the others candles each night of the holiday. The holiday of Hanukkah celebrates the rededication of the Temple in Jerusalem after Syrians were chased out of the Holy Land. It also marks the eight days that a menorah burned with one day's worth of oil. Celebrants exchange small gifts during Hanukkah.

"The Brooklyn district attorney said Friday he will impanel a grand jury to investigate the death of Akai Gurley, who was unarmed when a rookie police officer shot him to death in the unlit stairwell of a housing project last month. ""I expect to present evidence regarding the ... shooting of Akai Gurley to a grand jury because it is important to get to the bottom of what happened,"" District Attorney Ken Thompson said in a press release. ""I pledge to conduct a full and fair investigation and to give the grand jury all of the information necessary to do its job."" Earlier Friday, Gurley's mother, Sylvia Palmer, said that ""I pray to God I get justice for my son."" ""My son was my heart and now he's been taken away from me,"" Palmer said at a press conference. The Brooklyn district attorney's decision comes as protesters take to the streets of American cities to protest police killings of unarmed black men in Ferguson, Missouri, and New York. A wake was held Friday night for Gurley at Brown Memorial Baptist Church in Brooklyn. Gurley, 28, was killed November 20. He was ""a total innocent who just happened"" to run into Officer Peter Liang in a ""pitch black"" stairwell at the Louis H. Pink Houses in Brooklyn, New York Police Commissioner William Bratton told reporters the day after the killing. Liang, with less than 18 months on the job and on probationary status, has been placed on modified assignment and stripped of his gun and badge pending an investigation. Liang and his partner were part of a ""violence reduction overtime detail"" at the Pink Houses, where a spate of serious crimes have been reported in recent months, including two robberies and four assaults, Bratton said. The officers had taken an elevator to the building's top floor to check on the roof and were taking the stairs down from the eighth floor, Bratton said, when the officer discharged the weapon. There were no lights in the stairwell leading up to the roof. Liang drew a flashlight and his weapon ""for safety reasons,"" the police commissioner said. The other officer did not draw his gun. In the darkened stairwell, Liang's gun discharged about the same time that Gurley, the father of a 2-year-old, and his girlfriend were entering the seventh-floor landing, Bratton said. U.S. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat who represents large sections of Brooklyn, said told CNN Friday that the problem in many police shootings is officer training, not race relations. He noted that Gurley was African-American and Liang is Asian-American. Jeffries said he's pleased the grand jury investigation will occur and hopes for ""an aggressive presentation of information.""","Brooklyn district attorney says he'll impanel grand jury in November 20 shooting .

"As Sen. Mary Landrieu soldiered through her re-election race this year with sinking poll numbers and the heavy drag of President Barack Obama, the refrain from her strategists and supporters was always the same: Don't count her out. She's a fighter. She will pull it off in the end. But in the hours before a runoff election on Saturday, when the three-term Louisiana Democrat faces Republican Congressman Bill Cassidy, it is hard to find anyone predicting the kind of eleventh hour victory that Landrieu pulled off in 1996 and 2002 -- turning her into a political legend. ""Sen. Landrieu has been a fabulous closer,"" said Joshua Stockley, a political science professor at the University of Louisiana at Monroe. ""Two of her three races, she was not supposed to win."" Landrieu is facing voters more than a month after the midterm elections that virtually wiped out Democrats in the South. She failed to clear a 50% threshold in November needed to avoid a runoff so Landrieu is heading into what could be the final race of her career battling nearly every trend that toppled Democrats this election cycle. Her base has shrunk dramatically in a state where Republicans are ascendant and she is one of the last white Democrats in the South holding statewide office. Louisiana voters remain apprehensive about the uneven economic recovery, and suspicious of the President's health care law. Adding to her struggle, Landrieu is a symbol of incumbency at a time when frustration with the deadlock in Washington is at an all time high. Her best argument -- clout -- evaporated Nov. 4th when the GOP took firm control of the Senate, diminishing the import of her race. Her embarrassing loss on the Keystone pipeline vote that she recently forced in the Senate only underscored Landrieu's diminished power in Washington. In the runoff phase, Landrieu has consistently trailed Cassidy, a physician. While there are many reasons to distrust midterm polling, the early vote numbers for Saturday's runoff also seemed to spell doom for the Democratic Senator. ""The percentage of whites is up. The percentage of men is up. The percentage of Republicans is up. The percentage of Democrats is down. None of these things are good for Sen. Landrieu,"" said Stockley, listing the trends in early ballots cast. ""If she's holding a magic card, then everyone in the world wants to know why she hasn't played it yet."" Like all the other vulnerable Democrats facing re-election in red states this year, Landrieu faced long odds with a midterm electorate that is historically more white, wealthy and conservative than in presidential years. When she was forced into the runoff by Louisiana's ""jungle primary""  -- she didn't even come close to the 50% threshold needed for an outright win -- she faced the more daunting prospect of turning out distracted voters on a Saturday in December, at a time when she and her allies are being heavily outspent by Republican allied groups. ""There's no perfect playbook for this kind of election,"" said Democratic Strategist Robby Mook, who managed the successful off-year election of Terry McAuliffe as governor of Virginia last year. At this juncture, ""it's a turnout game, and it's pretty straightforward."" Landrieu's formula for victory Saturday is to pump up turnout among African-American voters across the state while drawing support, as she has in elections past, from independents and moderate Republicans in the counties that ring New Orleans. That two-pronged strategy isn't so easy this year in a state that Obama lost by 17 points. She ran ads rebuking the President on Obamacare and energy issues, while trying to avoid alienating black voters. She selectively ran some of those ads outside the New Orleans media market. She tapped her father, Maurice ""Moon"" Landrieu, for a series of father-daughter ads reminding black voters of the family legacy. As the mayor of New Orleans in the 1970s, Moon Landrieu won the respect of many black voters by desegregating the workforce and opening high-ranking city jobs and contracts to blacks. But the collapse of the coalition that always carried Landrieu across the finish line was stunning on Nov. 4. Turnout was strong among black voters, who comprise about 30% of the electorate. But Landrieu's support among white voters slid to 18% from 33% in 2008. She lost ground among self-described independents and moderates, and even among women—one of her chief targets in her recent events. The erosion of her support was particularly striking given the weaknesses of her opponent. ""Cassidy is a really stiff, wooden, uncommunicative candidate who is a bad speaker,"" said Pearson Cross, a political science professor at the University of Louisiana Lafayette. ""He's your geeky family doctor."" Democratic strategists privately mused that they wished Cassidy's wife -- a far more charismatic figure -- had run instead. But Cassidy relentlessly pounded the anti-Obama narrative and the line that Landrieu had voted with the President 97% percent of the time. So far, it has worked. ""This election has not been about Cassidy,"" Cross said. ""This election has been about the negative press that the President has gotten and the ability of Cassidy to tie Barack Obama and (Senate Majority Leader) Harry Reid to Mary Landrieu. In this final act Saturday, the Louisiana race will test the limits of the vaunted Landrieu turnout operation, particularly in Orleans Parish, which has been the family stronghold for generations. After Hurricane Katrina, Landrieu operatives were vigilant about maintaining their voter data—scrubbing their voter files to make sure addresses and phone numbers were up to date after each purge of voters who had moved out of state by the Secretary of State's office.  Landrieu's campaign also partnered with the Democratic Party to register scores of new voters across the state this year, focusing particularly on ushering new black voters into the party. In Saturday's election, it is hard to underestimate the importance of Landrieu's turnout operation in Orleans Parish, which encompasses the city of New Orleans. ""They've always considered Orleans Parish to be their firewall,"" said Edward Chervenak, director of the Survey Research Center at the University of New Orleans.   ""They need that get out the vote machine operating in the city to help overcome the deficit she will face throughout the rest of the state."" She won her first race in 1996 by less than 6,000 votes -- but with a huge margin in Orleans Parish. In 2002, like this year, the Democratic Party pulled its ads and much of its financial support -- writing off the runoff race as a lost cause -- but she eked out a win in part by boosting black voters' share of the electorate above the level of the first round of voting -- an unusual feat for a runoff. In Landrieu's best race in 2008 -- a year when she rode on Obama's coattails -- she won by more than 121,000 votes. But if you took out Orleans Parish, her margin was only about 21,500 votes. Underscoring the importance of Orleans Parish, Landrieu brought in Ryan Berni -- the campaign manager for her brother, Mitch -- to head the campaign in a recent shakeup. Earlier this year, he helped Mitch Landrieu win a majority of the black and the white vote in Orleans Parish to become the first white mayor of the predominantly black city since his father left the office in 1978. But the number of voters turning out to cast ballots in Orleans Parish dropped in the latest round of early voting. Landrieu's campaign insists that the numbers were skewed by the Thanksgiving holiday, and they are counting on high turnout on Election Day. To many others, however, it just seemed like the latest sign of foreboding for a race that is unlikely to go well for Landrieu on Saturday.","Sen.

"Eric Williams, a former justice of the peace in Texas accused of killing two prosecutors, could soon be sentenced to death after being convicted of capital murder. A Kaufman County, Texas, jury on Thursday took about 1½ hours to find Williams guilty of murder in the death of Cynthia McLelland, the wife of that county's then-District Attorney Michael McLelland, the county's Bruce Wood said. The couple was fatally shot in March 2013 at their home in Forney, which is about 20 miles east of Dallas. Williams wasn't put on trial for Michael McLelland's death or the January 2013 killing of Kaufman County Assistant District Attorney Mark Hasse, though authorities did accuse him in both of those deaths. Even then, Williams could be executed. The sentencing phase in the Cynthia McLelland case is set for Monday morning, at which time prosecutors will ask jurors -- the same ones who found him guilty -- to recommend the death penalty, Wood said. ""I understand there will be quite a few witnesses brought in on both sides,"" said Wood, who is a Kaufman County judge in addition to speaking for the county. Wood estimates the sentencing phase could last all next week. County Sheriff David Byrnes has said the three killings -- of Hasse and the McLellands -- stemmed from Williams' ""past legal problems with the criminal justice system of this county."" These legal troubles included a 2012 conviction on burglary and theft charges that led to his removal as justice of the peace. According to court papers, his wife Kim has confessed to her role in the killings and implicated her husband as the triggerman. In Hasse's death, Kim Williams was the getaway driver; in the McLellands' killings, she was the passenger, Byrnes has said. A grand jury tied all three killings together in April 2013 when they indicted the couple on capital murder, though Williams' wife Kim has yet to stand trial. Plus, Eric Williams himself hasn't been tried for Hasse or Michael McLelland's deaths. The cases have shaken many in Kaufman County, a community of about 100,000 residents in northeastern Texas. ""It's an unusual situation because it was an attack on law enforcement, but the other part of law enforcement -- the prosecution (as opposed to police),"" Wood said. ""That seldom occurs, especially in a rural county.""","Eric Williams, his wife were accused of killing 2 prosecutors, a prosecutor's wife .

"New research shows a major section of west Antarctica's ice sheet will completely melt in coming centuries and probably raise sea levels higher than previously predicted, revealing another impact from the world's changing climate. According to a study released Monday, warm ocean currents and geographic peculiarities have helped kick off a chain reaction at the Amundsen Sea-area glaciers, melting them faster than previously realized and pushing them ""past the point of no return,"" NASA glaciologist Eric Rignot told reporters. The glacial retreat there ""appears unstoppable,"" said Rignot, lead author of a joint NASA-University of California Irvine paper that used 40 years of satellite data and aircraft studies. NASA says the region has enough ice to raise global sea levels by 4 feet. According to Rignot, conservative estimates indicate the complete melting of the Antarctic ice cited in the study could take several centuries. However, the melting could have an impact this century, according to Sridhar Anandakrishnan, a geosciences professor at Pennsylvania State University. The United Nations' most recent climate change report estimated sea levels could rise from about 1 foot to 3 feet by 2100. Such a rise could displace tens of millions of people from coastal areas around the world. Anandakrishnan said the U.N. estimate largely didn't take into account the melting ice sheet from west Antarctica, because few studies for that area had been completed. ""So as this paper and others come out, the (U.N.) numbers for 2100 will almost certainly"" lean closer to 3 feet, he said. Why scientists think it's unstoppable . The rate at which the area's ice is melting has increased 77% since 1973, and there are several reasons, researchers said. The ice sheet there, unlike those in much of east Antarctica, is attached to a bed below sea level. That means ocean currents can deliver warm water at the glaciers' base, or grounding lines -- places where the ice attaches to the bed, NASA said. The heat makes the grounding line retreat inland, leaving a less massive ice shelf above. When ice shelves lose mass, they can't hold back inland glaciers from flowing toward the sea. Glaciers then flow faster and become thin as a result, and this thinning is conducive to more grounding-line retreat, NASA said. ""The system (becomes) a chain reaction that is unstoppable, (with) every process of retreat feeding the next one,"" Rignot said. Iceberg is twice the size of Atlanta . A hill or a mountain behind the grounding line would slow this retreat. But the beds behind nearly all the Amundsen Sea glaciers slope downward, researchers said. Rignot said he believes climate change and a depletion of the Earth's ozone layer are partly to blame, saying they have changed the winds in the area to cause more warm water to go toward the glaciers. Climate change skeptics, many backed by a huge campaign funded by the fossil fuels industry, seek to undermine research findings on the impacts of what is popularly referred to as global warming. They challenge the scientific validity of climate change, as well as the role of human-produced pollution in contributing to it. For example, such opponents of policies to reduce U.S. carbon emissions say the severe North American winter that just ended and evidence of increasing Antarctic sea ice defied the claims by scientists of a warming planet. However,  Rignot and Anandakrishnan said their findings on the west Antarctica ice shelf don't clash with news of the record levels of Antarctic sea ice. They noted that sea ice forms and melts quickly, while glaciers are subject to longer-term change. Rignot added that the same winds that stir subsurface heat toward the base of Antarctic ice shelf also can expand sea ice cover. Not a first . Such a melting would be uncommon, but not necessarily unprecedented, Anandakrishnan said. Evidence shows that west Antarctica retained an ice sheet during the last few 100,000-year cycles of glacial formation and retreat, he said. But evidence also suggests the entire west Antarctica ice sheet might have melted 500,000 to 600,000 years ago, Anandakrishnan said. The six Amundsen Sea glaciers are just a portion of the entire west Antarctic ice sheet. Though much of the other west Antarctic sections are grounded below sea level, the Amundsen Sea area is more vulnerable, in part because it has fewer hills behind the leading edges and because the shape of the sea floor helps usher more warm water to the base, NASA said. Anandakrishnan said it was possible that the melting in the Amundsen Sea area could destabilize other ice sheets. The entire west Antarctic ice sheet has enough ice to raise the global sea level by about 16 feet, NASA said.","Warm currents, other factors have caused chain reaction, NASA says .
Region has enough ice to raise global sea levels by 4 feet, scientists say .
Researchers: Melting could take several hundred years, but could have impact this century ."
"What a difference a year makes! Last year's address by President Vladimir Putin to the Federal Council, the joint session of both houses of Russian parliament, was a rather low-key affair by international standards and the world was not exactly losing sleep over it, apart from the usual talking heads on Russian television and newspaper commentators who were listing the main points of the speech without much excitement. Ukraine was mentioned in last year's address in the sense that Russia was planning to continue working with it with the view of promoting Ukrainian membership of the Customs Union, as part of the bigger Euroasian project. There was no talk of the military build-up and on the economy nothing extraordinary was proposed. On the whole there was no sense of urgency present in the measures suggested. But since then the situation has changed dramatically, with Russia finding itself in a bitter stand-off with the West over the crisis in Ukraine and the new status of Crimea that has become part of Russian territory. So the annual address delivered by Putin this time round was completely different in its tone and rhetoric and it was no wonder that the media, both Russian and foreign, were watching it carefully for any signs that would give an idea of how the Kremlin intends to deal with the new realities. Putin made it clear that Crimea was going to remain Russian and if anyone had other ideas, well, tough luck. He also made the point of insisting that had the crisis in Ukraine not happened at all, the West would have found some other pretext to try to undermine Russia's economic standing. He even went as far as saying that this policy of containment of Russia by the West dates back years, decades and even centuries: obviously music to the ears of those people in Russia who always said trusting the West was a bad idea. The Russian president warned the West that Russia was prepared to defend itself militarily, should the need arise, and was not going to allow anyone to achieve military superiority over it -- unimaginable a year ago. On the economy Putin refrained from coming up with any dramatic reforms, like for, example, having a closer look at some of the past privatizations schemes and the way they had been conducted and he did not propose any radical changes with the aim of diversifying the economy that is greatly dependent on the sale of oil and gas. What was unusual, though, was his proposal of a one-off amnesty to Russians who are holding their money abroad, offering them to bring it back into the country without fear of having to explain its origins. It remains to be seen whether this offer will be taken by the Russian rich who keep their money abroad in off-shore accounts, considering that the ruble is currently in freefall. Putin did send a signal to banks and investors who were, as he put it, ""rattling the rouble."" The message was primarily directed at state-owned companies and banks that have been lured by large returns from forex operations at a time of the ruble sliding and occasionally picking up strength. Will they listen to him, these barons who get paid more than most top execs in Western companies? To sum it up, the Kremlin appears to have no taste for any drastic economic measures and will continue to pursue the line that Western sanctions hurt not just Russia but the West as well. Putin has always been known for treading carefully and avoiding any sudden movements or changes in the economy, something that his critics say may have actually prevented Russia from having a more flexible and durable economy. As a result the speech disappointed both liberals and nationalists, as it failed to offer either a dramatic liberalization of the economy or any move to put it on the ""mobilization rails,"" as if a war was imminent. But on the whole the speech showed a confident president who still enjoys a very health popularity rating of over 80% and who can expect the country to stay united behind him, considering that the impact of sanctions and falling oil prices has yet to be felt by most of the population. In fact, the fall of the oil prices is being offset by a weak ruble, as the government sells ""black gold"" in dollars and gets plenty of rubles to play with. But if the oil prices fall well below $60 per barrel, as some experts are predicting, that would be tough to stomach for Russia, even with its substantial hard currency reserves totaling around $450 billion. In the meantime Putin can afford to remain defiant and challenge the West. But who knows how long this situation can last?","Russia finds itself in bitter stand-off with West over Ukraine crisis, new status of Crimea .

"Uruguayan lawmakers have approved a same-sex marriage measure, leaving just one more key step -- the president's signature -- before such couples can wed in the South American country. A marriage equality bill passed the lower house Wednesday, with 71 of 92 lawmakers supporting the measure. The house approved a different version of the measure in December. Last week, Uruguay's senate approved the bill in a 23-8 vote. If signed by President Jose Mujica, who has indicated he supports the measure, the proposal would make Uruguay the second country in Latin America to legalize same-sex marriage and the 12th country in the world to do so. Neighboring Argentina legalized such marriages in 2010. In Argentina, the push to legalize same-sex marriage met with fierce opposition from the Roman Catholic Church, with Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio -- then the archbishop of Buenos Aires and now Pope Francis -- engaging in a notorious war of words with the government over the issue. In Uruguay, the church has taken a similar tack, with officials describing the measure as a harsh blow to the institutions of marriage and the family. ""Why make relative or devalue an institution that is already so injured, like the family, introducing deep modifications that are going to confuse more than clarify?"" the Rev. Pablo Galimberti, bishop of Salto, wrote in a recent post on the website of the Uruguayan Bishops Council. Uruguay's Broad Front, a coalition of left-wing political parties, backs the measure. Last week, the group's president stressed that the proposed law changes a civil institution and has nothing to do with the church. ""Here we are speaking about RIGHTS, with capital letters. Rights that were denied and repressed for a long time, and which a society that is trying to be modern and inclusive necessarily must recognize, to advance in equality,"" wrote Sen. Monica Xavier. ""Rights that are inherent to people, that are not a legislative creation, but something that the law must recognize."" Same-sex marriage has sparked debate and impassioned demonstrations from supporters and opponents in many countries. Legislators in France and the United Kingdom are among lawmakers worldwide weighing proposals to legalize same-sex marriage. In the United States, the question of same-sex marriage went before the Supreme Court last month, and justices are now deliberating the matter. The first same-sex couples walked down the aisle in the Netherlands in 2001. Since then, almost a dozen countries have passed laws allowing same-sex marriages and domestic partnerships, including Canada, South Africa, Belgium and Spain. In 2009, Uruguay was the first Latin American country to allow same-sex couples to adopt children. It was also one the first Latin American countries to allow same-sex civil unions. The measure approved by Uruguayan lawmakers Wednesday removes the words ""man"" and ""woman"" from the country's civil code and replaces them with the word ""spouse,"" CNN affiliate Teledoce reported.","The measure must be signed by Uruguay's president .
If approved, Uruguay will become the second Latin American country to legalize same-sex marriage .

"(CNN) -- Apparently, all those clicks over at Buzzfeed are paying off in more ways than one. For hitting a big traffic goal, all 700 or so employees of the viral news site will be getting free Apple smartwatches -- a bonus that will cost at least $245,000. Early last month, CEO Jonah Peretti sent a memo to his staff celebrating Buzzfeed surpassing $100 million in revenue for the year. ""This is a huge milestone and amazing accomplishment!"" he wrote. He also issued a challenge. If the site hit 200 million unique visitors and 750 million video views in November, the entire staff would get one of Apple's watches, which are set to hit the market in early 2015. The least expensive model will sell for $349. Peretti told the staff they'd met the goals at a meeting on Thursday, according to Business Insider. He later confirmed it on Twitter. . Known largely for buzzy, viral posts that have a way of rampaging across social media -- critics would call it clickbait -- Buzzfeed, founded in 2006, has made moves over the past couple of years to expand its coverage to politics and other serious news.

"(CNN) -- The longest-running holiday special still has a very shiny nose. ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" premiered on television December 6, 1964, and is now one of the holiday season's perennial favorites. The story of the reindeer who saves Christmas is beloved among children and adults alike. The Rankin-Bass animated film production company used Japanese puppets and stop motion to tell the tale, bolstered by a soundtrack featuring Burl Ives' rendition of the theme song. In the story, Santa's reindeer Donner and his wife have a son, Rudolph, who has the distinction of a nose that glows. He runs away after being made to feel an outcast and links up with an elf who dreams of becoming a dentist and an adventurer seeking silver and gold. After ending up on the Island of Misfit Toys and wandering for a while, Rudolph goes on to save his loved ones from the Abominable Snow Monster and guides Santa through a blizzard that threatens to ruin Christmas. In 2006, the New York Times reported that fans drove for miles to see the Rudolph and Santa Claus puppets at the Center for Puppetry Arts in Atlanta. The pair were thought to be the last of the surviving production puppets. They had been taken home by a production company employee and given to her children after filming was completed. ""In 2005, the nephew of the original rescuer found the puppets in a family attic and brought them to be appraised on the PBS series 'Antiques Roadshow,' "" the Times said. ""Created for about $5,000 each in 1964, they were valued at $8,000 to $10,000 for the pair. The family sold both figures to Kevin A. Kriess, the president of TimeandSpaceToys.com and a lifelong fan of the Rankin-Bass films."" The special has been shown every year since it premiered, which gives it a leg up over other beloved shows like ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" and ""Frosty the Snowman"" and makes it the longest-running program of its type. And viewers still love it. One fan posted on social media, ""I love watching Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer...and remember our tv that was like this growing up. Of course our picture was black and white. Lol. #rudolphrocks #thosewerethedays.""","The beloved 'Rudolph' special turns 50 this year .

"Eight Indian army soldiers were killed Friday in a gunfight with militants in Indian-controlled Kashmir ahead of a visit by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In a predawn attack, heavily armed militants stormed an Indian army camp 85 kilometers (about 52 miles) from Srinagar in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. The militants opened fire at the camp near the Line of Control, the defacto border between India and Pakistan in Kashmir. ""Eight army troopers including an officer and three cops were killed in the gunfight, which has now ended,"" an Indian defense spokesman said in a statement. ""In the ensuing firefight, all the six foreign terrorists were eliminated."" The gunfight came two days ahead of Modi's visit to Indian Kashmir to campaign for the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, or BJP, which is making its presence felt in the Muslim-majority Kashmir for the first time. Modi's BJP has fielded candidates for the ongoing state assembly polls. Attacks on the army camps by militants have been occurring in Indian-administered Kashmir, which has been in the throes of separatist violence since 1989. Last week, militants attacked another army camp in the Arnia sector of the border near the main city of Jammu. The nearly 24-hour-long gunfight claimed 12 lives.","Militants storm Indian army camp in Indian-controlled Kashmir .

"Government surveillance of telephone records and conversations in the name of national security has long been controversial. The debate, which dates back decades, is back in the news with recent revelations that the U.S. government is collecting telephone records in the United States and some Internet traffic overseas. Here's a primer on what the government is getting, how it affects you and what the legal debate is all about: . I live in the United States. What kinds of records is the government collecting on me? U.S. officials have acknowledged collecting domestic telephone records containing the time and date of calls and telephone numbers involved. A secret court order published by The Guardian newspaper also indicates the government is getting rough location information and details that would identify the specific handsets used to make mobile calls. That court order names Verizon Business Network Services, but analysts say similar orders are likely in effect for all U.S. carriers, meaning the government has logs of most, if not all, telephone calls. The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with NSA activities, reported Friday that the agency has also collected credit card records. But the newspaper couldn't say if that collection effort is continuing or was a one-time effort. I live overseas. What might the United States have? If you're a United States citizen or permanent resident living or traveling overseas, the government says it's not collecting anything on you, If it does, the government says, it's incidental and the resulting data is kept under strict controls. But the picture could be different for citizens of other nations living outside the United States. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper on Thursday indirectly confirmed a program to collect data generated by overseas customers of some of the largest internet services companies in the world, including Microsoft, Yahoo, Google and Apple. Clapper's statement came Thursday in response to stories in the Washington Post and The Guardian newspaper Thursday reporting the existence of a program called PRISM. The program is designed to collect ""audio and video chats, photographs, e-mails, documents"" and other materials, The Post reported. The Wall Street Journal, however, said the monitoring doesn't include the contents of messages. Opinion: NSA's phone snooping a different kind of creepy . Is the government listening to my phone calls? Clapper says it's not. What happens to the records? The telephone records go into a database, where they can't be accessed unless a judge gives the go-ahead in a national-security investigation, Clapper said. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Thursday that the records can't be accessed without ""reasonable and articulable suspicion"" that they're relevant to terrorist activity. It's less clear what happens to the Internet monitoring data, but Clapper said it's ""used to protect our nation from a wide variety of threats."" Why does the government need this information? Access to such information ""allows counterterrorism personnel to discover whether known or suspected terrorists have been in contact with other persons who may be engaged in terrorist activities, particularly people located inside the United States,"" a senior Obama administration official said Thursday. Clapper said Thursday that the telephone records allow analysts to ""make connections related to terrorist activities over time."" The Internet data collected overseas ""is among the most important and valuable foreign intelligence information we collect, and is used to protect our nation from a wide variety of threats,"" he said. Who approved these programs? Both programs have been approved by all three branches of government, officials say. The telephone records collection program was authorized by the Foreign Surveillance Intelligence Court under what Clapper called ""stringent condition."" It's reviewed every 90 days, he said. Feinstein said the order published in The Guardian was the approval of one such 90-day review. The court is special judicial office set up as part of the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The court operates in secrecy, reviewing requests by intelligence agencies to conduct electronic surveillance and other activities as part of espionage, terrorism and national security investigations. Is it legal? The FISA Court, Clapper and other administration officials obviously think so. But many privacy advocates and some lawmakers believe this sort of broad data collection goes too far. ""While I cannot corroborate the details of this particular report, this sort of widescale surveillance should concern all of us and is the kind of government overreach I've said Americans would find shocking,"" said Sen. Mark Udall, D-Colorado, who serves on the Senate Intelligence Committee. In a letter last year to Attorney General Eric Holder, Udall and Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, complained about secret interpretations of the Patriot Act, details of which are classified but which the senators said ""most Americans would be stunned to learn the details of."" ""As we see it, there is now a significant gap between what most Americans think the law allows and what the government secretly claims the law allows,"" the senators wrote. ""This is a problem, because it is impossible to have an informed public debate about what the law should say when the public doesn't know what its government thinks the law says."" Has this happened before? In 2006, it was revealed that the NSA was secretly collecting telephone records as part of an effort to root out potential terror plots. At that time, Verizon denied reports that it was providing the NSA with data from customers' domestic calls. The company said that while it is committed to helping the government protect against terrorist attacks, ""we will always make sure that any assistance is authorized by law and that our customers' privacy is safeguarded."" The Electronic Frontier Foundation is also suing the NSA over claims that it was working with AT&T and possibly other telecommunications companies to suck up enormous amounts of Internet traffic through secure NSA-controlled rooms attached to network stations. Other programs, some going back decades, have stoked similar concerns. In fact, abuses by intelligence services led to the passage of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in an effort to rein in domestic surveillance practices.","Data collection revelations expand to Internet and credit card data .

"A country is suffering from a deep recession, unemployment is increasing, and the government deficit looms larger by the day. Part of the problem comes from an overvalued, fixed exchange rate. Anti-government demonstrations are a common occurrence, and riots are increasingly frequent. The country seems engulfed by a rising wave of chaos. The International Monetary Fund is administering an aid package. The government is duly passing austerity package after austerity package, at the behest of foreign creditors, while ignoring the population's wishes and representatives. The country in question? Greece in 2011? No, it's Argentina in 2001. While not every part of the puzzle falls into place, many of the similarities are striking. It all started so well. For a while, after Argentina introduced a currency board -- a rigid link with the U.S.-dollar -- inflation came down, and consumption and growth surged. Asset prices ballooned, wages went up, and the new prosperity was everywhere -- in swanky restaurants, in the form of gleaming new cars, and in massive public building projects. Then, suddenly, the dream fell apart overnight. In Greece, joining the euro -- effectively a way of fixing Greece's exchange rate vis-à-vis its European partners -- also caused a drastic reduction in inflationary expectations. Lower interest rates fueled a consumption and housing binge; growth looked good for a few years, and so did tax receipts. Everyone was spending: firms, consumers and the government. In both cases, the rigid exchange rate went hand-in-hand with a dramatic loss in competitiveness. Both Argentina and Greece continued to import much more than they exported; for a while, the high life continued, fueled by foreign borrowing that paid for the gap. In both Greece and Argentina, there were fudged numbers in the public accounts. While the Greek case is well known, Argentina's debt/GDP ratio increased by more than 10% in four years, from 1994 to 1998. At the same time, official central government accounts showed deficits of 1.7% to 2.2% -- in an economy that was growing by up to 8% per year, the debt/GDP ratio should actually have been falling. In both cases, the ability to raise taxes was very small, with the government raising no more than 20%-30% of GDP. When the crisis came, with interest rates moving up sharply in the secondary market for government bonds, the first reaction was denial; then a wave of austerity measures. Argentina brought back Domingo Cavallo, the architect of its Houdini-like escape from hyperinflation half a decade earlier. The Greeks voted in a new, reforming government under George Papandreou, which promptly found so many skeletons in the cupboard that it had to go cap in hand to its European partners soon after. In both cases, the IMF (in the Greek case, together with the European Union) kept on lending long after it became clear that the country was insolvent. The political pressure was just too great not to do so; until the end, lenders hoped that the risk premium might one day start to fall, and that a combination of austerity and cheap loans from international institutions would make the problem go away. The increasingly hectic political moves over the last week in Greece are also reminding many veterans of emerging market crises of the Argentine case. The Greek government will surely fall if it loses the referendum; Argentina's cabinet became a revolving door for ministers before finally defaulting in chaotic fashion. Greece shows that all of the eurozone is now potentially subject to wrenching debt crises of the type that were once the prerogative of emerging markets. The cause of the problem is often similar -- a pegged exchange rate at an artificial rate, combined with massive debts issued in a foreign currency. Once the peg failed, Argentina's banking system imploded; Argentines could not touch their savings for years, and the economy collapsed, before rebounding sharply. For the Republic by the Rio de la Plata, a commodity boom eventually helped to turn the economy around. No similar positive shock from foreign demand is going to save the Greeks -- they simply do not produce enough of a range of goods to benefit. Whether Greece can avoid the wholesale destruction of its banking system is unclear, especially if a ""no"" vote arrives. Perhaps Papandreou should make sure there is a helicopter on standby, to rescue him from the presidential palace should he be forced to flee from angry protesters -- as Argentine President Fernando de la Rue was in December 2001.","Hans-Joachim Voth believes Greece in 2011 is similar to Argentina in 2001 .

"Maybe she meant to, maybe she didn't, but Mary Landrieu reached straight for the encyclopedia of Things Losing Candidates Say. The Louisiana Senator — an 18-year Washington veteran and outgoing chairwoman of the Senate Energy Committee, blessed with one of the most recognizable last names in southern politics —  stepped away from a modest crowd of supporters at a campaign event here for an interview about her difficult runoff race against Republican Bill Cassidy. ""It's not over until it's over,"" Landrieu said of the campaign, which has been left for dead by national Democrats. ""The only poll that counts is Election Day."" A few of the reporters and political types standing nearby exchanged knowing glances. Landrieu's defeat gives Republicans ninth seat this cycle . As defined by political analyst Stuart Rothenberg, who curated the definitive list of ""Things Losing Candidates Say"" for Roll Call last year, the luckless phrase is a pretty good indicator that ""you are losing the race at the time and have no empirical evidence to the contrary."" The evidence was stacked against Landrieu, who advanced to the runoff after losing a strategic bet that she would win Louisiana's non-partisan primary outright four weeks ago. Instead, she got 42 percent, far short of the 50.1% needed to win, and voters are now consolidating around Cassidy. If Landrieu had pulled it out Saturday, it would be have been an epic fourth quarter miracle that would put Les Miles to shame. She would have had to keep African-American turnout on par with the November primary, and somehow find a way to increase her support among white voters from the dreadful 18 percent she received last month, all in the middle of the holiday season. It was a near-impossible lift. There hasn't been a gold standard poll of the race, but she was losing by 15 or 20 points depending on the survey. The actions of national Democrats were an even better tell. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee canceled its ad reservations for the runoff after Landrieu failed to win the Nov. 4 jungle primary outright, effectively ceding the airwaves to Cassidy and Republicans, who are outspending her 7-1 on television. Supporters put on a brave face. ""Mary has always had close races and she always pulled them out,"" said Harold Ritchie, a state representative and funeral director from Bogalusa. ""A lot of us are counting on that happening one more time."" Politically speaking, Louisiana is a weird place. They have elections in odd years and run ""jungle primaries."" Politicians, state and local, genuflect before the gods of the oil and gas industry. It's a state that's twice voted an Indian-American Catholic Rhodes scholar into the governor's office (Bobby Jindal) and seems primed to succeed him with a Republican who reportedly liked to wear diapers while soliciting a prostitute in the French Quarter (David Vitter). There's a proud populist streak, a fraught racial history and a healthy dash of corruption. ""Louisiana politics is of an intensity and complexity that are matched, in my experience, only in the Republic of Lebanon,"" A.J. Leibling once wrote about the state. He was referring to the strange gumbo coalitions — white, black, cajun, redneck, uptown, downtown — that candidates assembled to win statewide elections. But Liebling was scribbling those thoughts for The New Yorker in 1960. These days, elections are nationalized, waged on television and online, and not even the most Lousianan of Louisianans can safely count on surviving at the ballot box — no matter how much clout one has built up in Washington or how many LSU tailgates one attends. Republicans have clobbered Landrieu with television ads tying her to President Barack Obama, whose approval rating in Louisiana, according to midterm exit polls, is 39 percent. ""The Republicans and her opponent Bill Cassidy have done a very effective job at creating an emotional target for voters to direct their frustration towards, and that would be President Obama,"" said New Orleans-based Democratic pollster Silas Lee. Landrieu, first elected in 1996, compared herself to New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees and Cassidy to an unknown rookie. Voting her out of office, she argues, would be akin to benching the star quarterback when the team needs it most. The argument, though, had lost its resonance with Obama's waning popularity and the newly-in-charge Republican Senate majority, depriving Landrieu of her coveted position as chairwoman of the Energy Committee. ""Seniority is based on how many years you have served,"" she said. ""Nothing has changed. I will have served 18 years. I have served with Democrats in charge, I have served with Republicans in charge. Nothing can take my seniority away. I will still be one of the highest ranking members of the Senate. I won't be chair. But I will be ranking member of the Energy Committee, and in that I will convene meetings of Democrats on Energy Committee, so Louisianans will still be at forefront, at the leadership table. I will still be part of the leadership team. That's much better than sitting on the back bench or sitting on the rookie bench."" Landrieu spent the final week flogging Cassidy, a congressman and LSU physician, over a late-breaking news story about questionable paychecks he received for part-time medical teaching work he may or may not have done at the university in Baton Rouge. ""This story has legs,"" Landrieu said. ""This story is breaking. You know, I wish it had broken a couple of weeks ago, but you know what? It broke now. Bill Cassidy cannot say, 'I am a doctor, I am higher than the law.'"" The argument felt like a Hail Mary, the last gasp of a zombie campaign that many Democrats are waiting for to die in a canebrake. And even the senator admits how difficult it is to run a campaign when no one, in Louisiana or elsewhere, seems to be listening anymore. ""Nothing seems to be breaking through these days,"" she said with a sigh, deviating slightly from her message. ""It's a very strange situation, all over the country. It's like people are just so mad, these commercials have really gotten people's emotions up. So getting people to focus on what really matters, leadership, honesty, integrity, hard work ..."" Landrieu trailed off. ""I am not going to give up,"" she said. ""These last few days are really important.""","Sen. Mary Landrieu lost her runoff race to GOP challenger Bill Cassidy on Saturday .

"New York may be the ""city that never sleeps"" but that won't come as a shock to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge who are still new parents and are expecting another baby in April. Prince George, now a toddler, would no doubt love the bright lights of the big city but he'll have to wait to see them himself. A source close to the couple tells me the main reason he isn't coming is that the program of events ""doesn't make it appropriate to bring him."" This visit certainly feels rocket-propelled compared to the leisurely three-week tour of New Zealand and Australia earlier this year, when George did join his parents. On Monday that will involve everything from a children's craft group in Harlem, a conservation reception with Hillary and Chelsea Clinton, to an NBA game where they're likely to rub shoulders with Beyoncé and husband Jay Z. On Tuesday, their plans include a moment of reflection at the September 11 memorial and a glittering charity dinner at the Metropolitan Museum of Modern Art. The couple will split at one point so that the heir to the throne can drop in on President Obama in Washington and give a speech at the World Bank. The White House said William's visit underscored ""the special relationship"" between the United States and the United Kingdom. ""The President looks forward to thanking The Duke of Cambridge for the hospitality shown to him by the Royal Family during the President's recent visits to the United Kingdom,"" a spokesperson said in a statement. William and Kate will also have additional private engagements. Each event has been carefully orchestrated to promote the couple's own interests or those of the British government. Royals are in the fund-raising business and if there's anywhere you can make big money, it's in the Big Apple. The causes the royal couple support are set to benefit hugely from this trip. The Duke and Duchess will meet the rich, the famous, the powerful and the vulnerable. No other couple in the world has the power to fill a room like the Cambridges can right now. Their spokesman tells me: ""The Duke and Duchess are looking forward to their visit enormously, especially as neither have visited New York or Washington in any capacity before. ""They fondly remember the incredibly warm welcome they received on their last official visit to the U.S.A. (California in 2011) and are very much looking forward to returning to the States."" That last visit was to sunny Los Angeles at a time when people were still sizzling from the hype around the royal wedding. It was an unquestionable triumph. This time they will be returning to a bitter East Coast winter but the welcome will no doubt be as warm. It may be reminiscent of Princess Diana's first visit to New York. Poignantly, Diana never came here with her husband Prince Charles. Kate and William are the next generation and very much a couple. Wherever they go in Manhattan, the royals will be greeted by cameras and big crowds. America's fascination with this fairytale is unmatched. Unlike Diana's day, many of the best royal moments come now from cell phones belonging to well-wishers. No doubt Kate will be asked how she is feeling after her bout of morning sickness -- with her entourage looking-on to make sure she doesn't over do it.","Britain's Prince William and Catherine arrive in New York City for a whirlwind tour Sunday .

"(CNN) -- Before NBC even aired ""Peter Pan Live!"" on Thursday night, its star, Allison Williams, asked viewers not to hate-watch it. Unfortunately, Tinkerbell didn't totally grant that wish. Although the live musical production garnered some celeb praise and a few pats on the back for its star, some critics and viewers concluded they were right to worry that it wouldn't fly. ""Peter Pan may have overcome the tyranny of time, but he couldn't surmount the constrictions of a television screen,"" wrote New York Daily News writer Don Kaplan. ""Or a wooden screenplay."" The special, which featured ""Girls"" star Williams as the eternally young Pan and Christopher Walken as Captain Hook, had been highly anticipated after NBC's ratings success with ""Sound of Music Live!"" starring Carrie Underwood. Deadline reported that the latest production tumbled in early ratings, down 46% from last year's live show. Though ""Sound of Music Live!"" did well with the numbers, it was ripped to shreds by some viewers, and the expectation was that the new show wouldn't be much better. But according to The Daily Beast's Kevin Fallon, ""Peter Pan"" proved to be just underwhelming. ""No, it's not that Peter Pan Live! was the 'Sound of Music Live!' train wreck our heads are still spinning over, like Carrie Underwood twirling maniacally on a soundstage hilltop,"" Fallon wrote. ""It's that 'Peter Pan Live!' was boring."" Perhaps trying to liven things up, viewers amused themselves on social media. One tweeted, ""Apparently Never Never Land is just a backdrop at Sears. #PeterPanLive."" Even ""Scrubs"" star Zach Braff got in on the fun, tweeting, ""All of this needs more cowbell #PeterPanLive,"" a nod to Walken's now-classic ""SNL"" skit. Actress Anna Kendrick tweeted, ""Increasingly worried this is going to turn into a ""Boys Don't Cry"" situation for Peter #PeterPanLive."" Walken didn't win any raves for his singing, but Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter found the actor to be ""simultaneously playing himself and playing Captain Hook, though for some long stretches one couldn't be sure if he was forgetting lines left and right or just letting the play breathe."" ""Seriously, you can't underestimate the Walken Effect,"" Goodman wrote. ""If you don't like him, well, this was not a three-hour musical for you, because during vast stretches of it Walken seemed to be doing something else entirely than his fellow singers and actors. But for those who love the Cult of Christopher, that level of odd behavior, moments of outright weirdness and his own brand of playing cool in chaos was precisely what made NBC's gambit work."" One person who knew all too well the experience of presenting a musical live on national TV gave it a thumbs up.

"(CNN) -- Toilet, latrine, loo, washroom, baÃ±o, water closet, toilette -- no matter what you might call it, toilets are a basic tool for sanitation. And in many countries, access to one is taken as a given. But not for the 1.1 billion people who have to defecate in the open. Men, women and children who are left to face conditions that are unsanitary, sometimes dangerous and often humiliating. So what if we told you the United States could help address the problem? And that there is actually bipartisan (yes, you read that right) legislation on the table? Because there is -- and the U.S. Congress has a unique opportunity to continue this leadership by investing in increased access to water and sanitation around the world. More than a hundred members of Congress have crossed the aisles and joined co-sponsors Reps. Earl Blumenauer (D-Oregon) and Ted Poe (R-Texas) to champion the Water for the World Act. And they are joined by over 80 civil society organizations that have raised their voices to support the bill. If passed, the Water for the World Act -- which moved through the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Thursday -- would help improve the lives of 2.5 billion people who live without a basic latrine. How? By ensuring funding for water programs get to the communities with the greatest need, a key step in addressing these critical issues, while making one of the best investments the United States can make. The lack of access to water and sanitation is a global problem that impacts health and economic development for all. Consider this: In many parts of the world, girls and women are disproportionately expected to find water, with many facing treks of several hours to a stream and back across often unsafe terrain. This can affect girls' ability to participate in the classroom, if they have time to attend at all. And for girls that attend schools that do not have private bathrooms, the cultural shame and embarrassment of menstruation more often than not pushes them to drop out. This is a major loss to the local community, because when women and girls have the tools they need to provide a healthier life for their families through education, it has a tremendous ripple effect across all areas of local development. Now is the time for Congress to act by helping the United States support other nations in the global effort to provide access to clean water and sanitation worldwide. The results could be dramatic. Just look at Ghana, where by the end of 2015 it is expected that less than 5% of people living in the five most affected regions of that country will be practicing open defecation, while more than half of them will be using improved toilet or latrine facilities. The Ghanaian government is looking to increase access to water and sanitation across the country with a goal of ensuring more than three quarters of Ghanaians have access to safe drinking water, an advance that would help keep waterborne diseases at bay. This is the kind of plan the United States should be behind, and it is the sort of progress that should be celebrated and recognized by donor countries around the world, not least because future significant advances require the support of key donor countries like the United States and Britain. So, will Congress respond? The finish line is within reach -- and we cannot afford to stop short by failing to pass the legislation before the end of this congressional session. By passing this bill, Congress would be sending a powerful statement that it is committed to the post-2015 development agenda, and helping hundreds of millions of people around the globe who lack clean water and sanitation. Because the reality is that no matter what you call it, a toilet can mean the difference between life or death.","Charles Rangel and Hugh Evans: Poor access to sanitation a global problem .

"New York (CNN) -- Demonstrators took their shouts for an end to what they say is widespread and unchecked police brutality to an NBA arena in Washington, a famed department store in New York, a well-known Ivy League commercial spot and to roads where they often brought traffic and passersby to a stop. Streets in major cities throughout the United States -- Boston, Chicago, Miami and New Orleans, among them -- filled again Friday night with protesters. And while crowds appeared to be smaller than previous nights, marchers were just as passionate about their voices being heard. One sign held by a young black man in Washington read simply: ""I could be next."" The protests are a response to the decision Wednesday by a New York grand jury not to charge police Officer Daniel Pantaleo in the chokehold death of Eric Garner during his Staten Island arrest, which was captured on cell phone video. They come a week after another decision not to indict by a grand jury in St. Louis County, Missouri, examining the killing of African-American teenager Michael Brown by a white police officer. In New York, protesters in the rain passed out a list of demands to the media regarding the Garner death in July. The top demands were for all officers involved to be fired, for a special prosecutor to be appointed to investigate all complaints of excessive force and for the state Legislature to make a chokehold punishable by significant penalties. A die-in at Macy's . Earlier, Eric Garner's daughter Erica told CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper"" that she wanted to see people punished for her father's killing. ""Justice to me is basically doing what's right,"" she said. ""I wouldn't be happy with (Pantaleo) just losing his job or being suspended or still getting paid. I wouldn't want that. I would want him to face time in jail."" She said that anyone who contributed to her father's death should go to prison. Protesters flooded Macy's iconic Herald Square location and staged a die-in as holiday shoppers looked on. Later, the flood of demonstrators shut off Times Square to traffic for 10 minutes before the crowd headed down 42nd Street, shouting, ""This is what democracy looks like."" They stopped again in Bryant Park and ringed a set of shops. Many of the workers in those stores came out and, in support, raised their hands in the air. It was also a short stop, as the crowd set off up Sixth Avenue, traversing against the flow of yellow cabs and other cars. A cacophony of car horns greeted the protesters and cabbies also held their hands out the window to give their approval. Only about 50 people protested in Chicago, but they marched with few breaks for hours. In Washington, the demonstrators held several four-minute long silent die-ins to empathize with the family of Michael Brown, a Missouri teenager who lie in the street for four hours after he was fatally shot by a police officer. ""I'm not an angry black man. I'm an outraged, hurt black man,"" one of the protest organizers told CNN. Six protesters shouted ""Hands up, don't shoot"" inside the Verizon Center before an NBA game between the Washington Wizards and the Denver Nuggets. Near Boston -- site of one of the largest demonstrations of the night -- a mass of protesters staged a die-in, several dozen of them blocking an intersection by lying on the road. As many as 1,000 people were marching Friday evening from Tufts University in Somerville, Massachusetts, near Boston to Harvard Square, according to a police estimate. ""People who don't already realize what is happening, maybe they will open their minds a little bit or people that do realize and don't care will realize that people are angry and it's not OK,"" Nicole, a Boston demonstrator who wouldn't give her last name, told CNN affiliate WHDH when asked why she marches. 'So many people realize this is a problem' Those who turned out to protest were a mix of ages and races. Chuck Helms, a 67-year-old New Jersey resident, marched in New York clad in a union-issue hard hat and satin Occupy Wall Street jacket. A sign dangling around his neck said, ""Remembering my brothers. BLACK LIVES MATTER."" The sign included photographs of Eric Garner, Trayvon Martin, Tamir Rice and Akai Gurley -- all black men whose controversial deaths made headlines. Gurley was shot dead last month by a police officer in a dark stairwell of a New York housing project. Brooklyn DA: Grand jury to investigate shooting of unarmed man . ""It's a shame that people have to die for us to become focused,"" Helms said. At least two people in New York were detained by police, who will not report on arrests until Saturday morning. In Chicago, Elizabeth Huston, a paralegal, joined in for the first time. ""So many people realize this is a problem. This is disproportionally affecting black men and women,"" she said. In Cleveland, protesters there marched over the death of Tamir, 12, who police say had a lifelike air gun and didn't comply with an officer's commands. ""CPD what do you say? How many kids have you killed today,"" they yelled. Cleveland cop who shot 12-year-old slammed for 'immaturity' in past job . The family of Tamir filed a wrongful death suit Friday against police over the killing, according to the Cleveland Plain Dealer. Growing movement . The demand for change in how law enforcement deals with minorities has been broad, with protests involving untold thousands of demonstrators from coast to coast, in towns both large and small. ""It's happening in every city, every town. It's happening here in Pittsburgh,"" Julia Johnson told CNN affiliate WPXI on Thursday. In many ways, it appears to be based on the Occupy Wall Street movement, which generated protests in New York and elsewhere in 2011 over inequality, corporate influence and other issues. The largely leaderless and underground movement is using social media to organize protests, which have morphed from a wide-ranging agenda to a tight focus on the issue of police violence against black men. The mostly peaceful protests shared many similarities with the protests of the Civil Rights era -- marches, signs, civil disobedience. One Asian-American protester felt inspired by the 1960s marches, but said she believes that struggle shows change will take a long time. ""If you think about the civil rights movement, it took 10 years for anything to happen between the protests and the boycotts of the buses to the actual Civil Rights Act,"" she said. Author and CNN commentator Michaela Angela Davis was marching in a mixed crowd of mostly white students chanting ""black lives matter."" The blocked streets didn't bother her so much. It's democracy, she said. ""I feel like we are seeing the American project at work. It is messy; it is difficult."" NYC officials: Fewer complaints against police . Meanwhile, New York officials said that complaints against police officers had fallen significantly in the second half of the year, compared with July to November 2013. A report that tallied complaints said 1,813 were made so far since July 1 of this year, 26% less than the number of complaints filed with the Civilian Complaint Review Board in the same period of the prior year. Excessive force allegations fell by 29%. The dip followed a slight rise in the first six months of the year, but, overall, allegations have declined in 2014. ""Over the past 11 months, my administration has implemented a series of initiatives and reforms aimed at bridging the gap between the NYPD and the communities they serve,"" Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a written statement. ""From ending the overuse of stop and frisk, to dropping the city's legal challenge to the racial profiling ban, to changing the department's policy on possession of small amounts of marijuana, we're steadily bringing crime down while drawing police and community closer together."" CNN's Ray Sanchez reported from New York, Athena Jones reported from Washington and Steve Almasy reported and wrote in Atlanta. Michael Pearson, Bill Kirkos, Dave Alsup, Ben Brumfield, Jason Carroll, Ralph Ellis, Dan Merica, Dana Ford and Greg Botelho and Melanie Whitney contributed to this report.","Daughter of Eric Garner says officers should go to prison .

"BANGKOK, Thailand (CNN) -- Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the world's longest-reigning monarch, has been hospitalized with fever and fatigue, the royal palace said Sunday. King Bhumibol Adulyadej attends a celebration of his 81st birthday in Bangkok on December 2, 2008. King Bhumibol Adulyadej, 81, was admitted to a Bangkok hospital on Saturday night. Doctors are monitoring his condition while administering antibiotics and intravenous fluid, the statement from the Royal Household Bureau said. The statement was carried by Thai News Agency and other local media. The king was formally crowned on May 5, 1950.  Watch why king's health is big issue » . Thailand abolished absolute monarchy in the 1930s, so the king wields little power although he last month appealed for unity amid Thailand's four-year-long political crisis.

"Just how bad is the drought in California? It's so bad, that in some extreme cases, thieves are stealing water. A father and daughter living off a water tank in the Central Valley report being ripped off eight times -- 2,500 gallons disappeared. That meant no showers -- and no toilet flushing. The lack of rain has pushed most of California into extreme or exceptional drought, the two worst levels, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. In most of California's major reservoirs, the water supplies that sustain many communities are less than half full. With water sources drying up, farmers are looking for underground springs to support their livelihoods. Steve Arthur works in California's San Joaquin Valley, drilling for water wells on drought-ravaged farms and ranches. ""It's just going crazy; people are starting to panic,"" said Arthur, the owner of Arthur & Orum Well Drilling Inc. Arthur said he is now drilling three times as many water wells. ""You go to the city, and some people don't know there's a drought,"" he told CNN. ""Then they pay more for their milk, and they realize this drought is making it more expensive for these poor farmers to put food on your table."" It's a problem that extends well beyond agriculturally rich California. The U.S. Department of Agriculture predicts some meat and produce prices will rise as much as 6% as farmers pay more money to water crops and feed livestock. Earlier this year, beef prices hit a record high, and milk, butter, eggs, fruit and vegetables were also on the rise as the drought continued to ravage farms. Avocados could increase as much as 35 cents each, lettuce could increase up to 62 cents per head, and tomatoes could jump by 45 cents, up to $2.84 per pound, according to an analysis by professor Timothy Richards of Arizona State University's W.P. Carey School of Business. The fast-food chains Chipotle and In-N-Out Burger have already raised prices, partly blaming the drought. Graphic: Breakfast takes a big bite out of your wallet . Mandatory and voluntary water conservation programs have been implemented throughout the West. Some cities have restricted residential water use, shut off public fountains and even let the grass in parks die. In mid-July, California officials approved statewide emergency water restrictions. The restrictions go into effect Friday, and infractions could bring fines of $500 per day. In California and beyond, shrinking lakes show just how bad things are. It's an inverse ripple effect -- the fresh water keeps draining, sucking down with it tourism business. Kern River Outfitters shut down its entire rafting operation this year because attempting to paddle downstream would have been a dangerous, futile effort over exposed Kern River rocks. ""The California drought has reduced projected Kern River flows to a level that is inadequate to run the top-quality rafting trips our guests expect,"" the company's website says. At many lakes, now landlocked boat docks are upward hikes from the water. Campers Ed and Barbie Perkins sat in lawn chairs just 3 feet from the shore of California's Lake Nacimiento, which has receded to 81% of its capacity. ""Normally we'd be way under water,"" Barbie Perkins said from their campsite. ""You would be able to drive your boat here. You would not be camping down here."" In Nevada, Lake Mead is at its lowest level since the dam was built in the 1930s. The lake supplies water to parts of Nevada, Arizona, Southern California and northern Mexico, and the supply is disappearing. ""I think it's important for people to realize water is a finite resource,"" said Rose Davis, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, Lower Colorado Region.  ""When you turn on the tap, it does not just magically appear. It has to come from the Colorado River."" In Santa Barbara, California, a program to reduce or stop watering in public parks has turned once pool-table green swatches of lawn along the waterfront into patches that look more like burlap. At Hearst Castle in San Simeon, the iconic Neptune Pool sits empty. Sparkling blue water has given way to a skateboarders' dreamland and a reminder of horrific drought.","California drought having ramifications beyond the state .

"(CNN) -- As a frequent traveler to Germany, I can't help but compare it to the United States. At first, I admired its new architecture. Then I became fascinated with how many different recycling bins line the streets. Lately, I've been marveling at the country's work-life balance. Germans work on average 35 hours per week by law. Yet, Germany hasn't lost any edge as an industrial powerhouse. In fact, Germany has remained Europe's biggest economy, even helping to keep the continent afloat during the global recession. (Though lately, growth has been modest for Germany as anxiety looms over Europe' drag economy.) And let's not forget the amazingly generous maternity-leave policies. When German babies are born, parents can take up to 14 months off of work while still making 65% of their salary. Concern for work-life balance doesn't stop there. German Labor Minister Andrea Nahles is calling for an ""anti-stress regulation"" forbidding employers from contacting their employees after business hours. No emails. No phone calls. No text messages. Talk about protecting people's personal time. There's good reason to be concerned about work-life balance. One-third of all heart disease cases are linked to stress, often from working too hard. A 2012 study showed that working lengthy hours increases current and future risks of depression. As NPR reported this week, a health expert from the Federation of German Trade Unions has sounded an alarm about the stress, burnout and reduced productivity that result from working too much. Whether or not the policy is enacted, one thing is clear: America could learn a thing or two from Germany when it comes to healthy work attitudes. Imagine the outcry if an American politician or high-ranking government official suggested a ""no emails after 6 p.m."" policy. The reactions? Probably: ""She's a lazy bum!"" ""He wants a nanny state!"" ""The government wants to take away my right to work all the time and neglect my family!"" I happen to have a job that I love, and I don't mind answering emails at all hours. But not everyone is so fortunate. For fear of losing their jobs, many Americans not only check emails after hours but also go to work while sick. Who cares if you're giving everyone strep throat? At least the boss knows you're a hard worker. And then there are the people who can make ends meet just fine, but still feel the need to be workaholics. Does our Protestant work ethic condition us to classify leisure time as a moral failure? Are we in some sort of sick competition to see who can be the most over-worked, over-stressed person? Compared with other rich countries, America is more stressed and less happy. According to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, we are 28th among advanced nations when it comes to work-life balance -- ninth from the bottom. If increasing our work hours hurts us instead of helping us, why exactly do we do it? What's fascinating about this topic is that American conservatives love to extol America's ""family values"" while demonizing those godless European countries like Germany. Yet America has no mandatory maternity leave, no limits to the work week and certainly no interest in curtailing the ability to be ""on call"" 24 hours a day. Isn't it pro-family to be able to have the time to care for a newborn? Isn't it pro-family to be able to spend time, uninterrupted, with your loved ones in the evening? Journalist Matt Bruenig argued in The Week earlier this year that if American social conservatives really wanted a return to households where men were the breadwinners, women stayed home with the kids and people had more time for family overall, they should embrace European-style socialism. But as the ""no email after work"" proposal demonstrates, some Germans fear they're getting too close to attaining that great American value called stress. In the United States, one in nine employees work more than 50 hours a week. In Germany, it's one in 18. That's a big difference. But get this -- in the Netherlands, only one in 152 employees works more than 50 hours per week, making Germany look quite ""American"" in comparison. Whether Germany restricts emails after hours isn't the point. The point is protecting your work-life balance. Germany knows how to do it, and we don't. Granted, some jobs, such as doctors, paramedics and firefighters, require some level of being on call. Other jobs -- which is to say, the majority of jobs -- have no such need. Nevertheless, we Americans always have our laptops open, our smartphones on and our tablets handy. Better be ready in case the boss needs us during dinner, family time or vacation. But this attitude will be worth it in the end, right? At least on our deathbeds we'll never have to say, ""I wish I'd made myself more available by email after work.""","In Germany a proposed law would ban employers from emailing employees after work .

"A new report by the New Jersey legislative committee investigating Gov. Chris Christie's involvement in the Bridgegate controversy shows an inconsistency between a top aide's sworn testimony and phone records. National Democrats quickly seized on the development as proof that Christie and his aides have stonewalled the investigation, even as the 136-page report failed to find any conclusive evidence tying Christie to the scandal. And a top New Jersey Democrat vowed the investigation would continue. In July, Regina Egea, a senior Christie aide, told the legislative panel investigating Bridgegate that she texted Christie during a key committee hearing last year and did not recall getting a response from the governor. But phone records show that it was Christie who texted Egea before the two traded a dozen messages during the hearing, according to a copy of the report obtained by CNN. The text messages were deleted before the committee could review them, but the report shows Egea's sworn testimony was not accurate. Related: Bridgegate panel co-chair: ""We are not done"" The report is inconclusive on what Christie knew about last year's lane closings that snarled traffic on the George Washington Bridge. Christie has denied knowing anything about the lane closures until they were over. On Dec. 9 last year, the state Assembly Transportation Committee heard testimony from three Port Authority officials and Egea monitored the hearing, Egea told the investigative committee in July. She said she texted the governor to tell him the Port Authority officials' testimony was professional and that she did not recall getting a response from Christie. But according to the report, Egea's phone records show that Christie texted her during the officials' testimony and the texting continued throughout the hearing. ""This is taking place on Dec. 9. This is taking place several days before the governor makes his press statement on Dec. 13 that he didn't know anything about this issue,"" said John Wisniewski, the Democratic co-chair of the investigative committee. He added, ""You know (the texts are) relevant to the investigation. You know the committee is going to want to look at them. To delete them and claim it was in the ordinary course of business strains credibility. It's just not believable."" A Christie spokesman declined to comment, pointing instead to what the governor said about the issue in August. ""I have no recollection of her even sending me a text,"" he said. ""It obviously was something of no moment or no import because I have no recollection of it at all."" The governor's office also released a statement from Randy Mastro, the attorney Christie hired to do an internal investigation. ""The Committee has finally acknowledged what we reported nine months ago -- namely, that there is not a shred of evidence Governor Christie knew anything about the GWB lane realignment beforehand or that any current member of his staff was involved in that decision,"" he said.

"(CNN)Like many Chinese, Beijing bank clerk Zhou Keran shudders when asked if he would donate his organs should he die. ""I would never. There's an old saying that our parents give us everything -- from our bodies to our hair -- and we have to show obedience to our family."" China said on Thursday it would end the harvesting of organs from executed prisoners on January 1 and while the move has been welcomed by human rights groups, it's hard to see how China can wean itself from the controversial practice if the views of people like Zhou are anything to go by. Traditional beliefs regard the body as sacred and it should remain intact after death. What's more, even if people are prepared to donate, there are fears that their body parts may be traded for profit and end up on the black market. Thus making a quick switch from organs supplied by death row inmates to a system based on altruism will be tough without a major shift in attitudes -- something the head of China's transplant system acknowledges. ""People have concerns about whether the organs will be allocated in a fair, open and just way,"" Huang Jiefu, director of the China Organ Donation and Transplant Committee said, according to state media. Low donation rate . China has one of the world's lowest rates of organ transplants, with 10,000 procedures each year. The country launched a voluntary donation scheme in 2010 but between that year and 2013 only 1,448 people donated organs -- a drop in the ocean compared with around 300,000 people in need of organ transplants each year. And just 0.6 people out of every million citizens have signed up to donate their organs when they die. To plug the shortfall, China has relied overwhelmingly on organs from death row prisoners. Technically, their organs can only be used under certain conditions, such as if no one collects the body, the inmate gives consent or  their family agrees to the medical use of the body. However, observers both in and outside China have questioned whether prisoners have the free will to give their consent and say it's become an unwritten policy that prisoners' organs can be used to ease the shortage. Even with the new rules, it's likely that death-row inmates will still supply organs for transplants. Huang said that prisoners will still be qualified to donate, but their organs will be registered in a computerized donation system instead of being traded privately, according to official English-language newspaper China Daily. Skepticism . Phelim Kine, deputy director, Asia Division, Human Rights Watch in New York, says he's ""extremely skeptical"" about whether China can really end its reliance on prisoners' organs in the foreseeable future. The opacity of China's prison and death penalty system, the massive profits in organ peddling and corruption make it ""near impossible,"" he says. ""Many Chinese citizens would be unconvinced about voluntarily signing away their organs, even for altruistic (reasons)."" Such fears are not unfounded, given the flourishing underground trade in organs and even corpses. Last month, local officials in southern China were found to have bought and sold dead bodies to fulfill cremation quotas in a ""body snatching"" scandal across two provinces. And earlier this year, authorities jailed a 12-member gang that recruited donors online and smuggled their kidneys by disguising them as seafood shipments. There are tentative signs that attitudes are beginning to change. Since the beginning of the year, 1,500 people have donated organs --  more than the total between 2010 and 2013. The government has set up a website to make it easier to become a donor but it's still something that few young people are willing to discuss with their families. Surveys have suggested that financial incentives, including payment of funeral and medical bills might help. Liu Teng, a 24-year old audio engineer from Beijing, says it's something he might consider. ""I want to help those in need and I feel like it would be a continuation of my life,"" he says. CNN's Serena Dong in Beijing contributed to the report.","China says it will end organ transplants from executed prisoners from January 1 .

"With Republican majorities coming in both houses of Congress and a Democrat in the White House, many people in Washington believe nothing will get done. We'd like to nominate an exception to that expectation: Criminal justice reform. Newt has talked about the need for ""confidence-building measures"" between the President and Republicans in Congress. The idea is that we should work on easier things first, so that we can work on harder things next. Transforming our nation's failed prison system looks like it could be easier now than anyone expected. Leaders in both parties agree on the need and direction for reform. They recognize that locking up millions of people for very long periods of time at ballooning costs is not a wise response to nonviolent crime. Warehousing nonviolent offenders for years behind bars has been an economic, moral and human catastrophe. The United States has 5% of the world's population, but 25% of its incarcerated population. During the past four decades, the rate of incarceration in the U.S. has more than quadrupled, costing us more than $80 billion a year. There are now roughly 2.3 million people in prison or in jail, which is nearly one in every 100 Americans. Today in a Florida prison, a 19-year-old man is serving a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence for drug possession. His incarceration will cost taxpayers $60,000 a year. He will receive no job training, no education and no drug treatment. He will leave prison beaten down. He'll carry the stigma and the barriers that come with being a felon, making it difficult for him to find a job and more likely that he will end up back in prison. As a corrections system, this makes no sense. We must rethink our approach from the ground up. And for federal crimes, we can start by building on bipartisan reforms that are spreading across the country at the state level. In the true spirit of federalism, states have led the way in passing reforms that protect public safety, more effectively punish and correct nonviolent offenders, save taxpayers money and ensure hardened and violent criminals remain behind bars. In Georgia, Gov. Nathan Deal has implemented a bold overhaul of the state's criminal justice system, slashing prison spending and reducing harsh penalties for nonviolent offenses. The result has been a 20% reduction over five years in the number of African-American men incarcerated. In Texas, Gov. Rick Perry has been so successful at using probation, parole and sentencing reform to both reduce the prison population while also reducing crime that people have termed his approach  the ""Texas Model."" Out west, California recently passed one of the most transformational examples of bipartisan criminal justice reform. Proposition 47, the ""Safe Neighborhood and Schools Act,"" was a sensible measure to reduce incarceration for nonviolent crimes and to increase investments in crime prevention, treatment and education. The initiative changed six low-level offenses, including simple drug possession, from felonies to misdemeanors, and will save California hundreds of millions of dollars each year in prison spending that wasn't working, reinvesting those savings into mental health and drug treatment, K-12 schools and victim services. While there is a lot to learn from the policy reforms brought about by Prop 47, there may be even more to learn from its politics. The initiative had the support of crime survivors, victims groups, business groups and 1,500 clergy across the state. Everyone from rapper Jay Z and the ACLU to Sen. Rand Paul and Grover Norquist lined up behind the measure. (We both endorsed it, too.) Conservative California businessman B. Wayne Hughes Jr. was the single largest individual donor to the effort, giving more than $1.25 million. Because of its broad-based support, Proposition 47 passed  by a huge margin of 59-41 percent. It even won in some conservative strongholds, such as Orange County and Riverside County. California isn't the only place where criminal justice reform did well on the ballot. Deal, and senators such as John Cornyn and Cory Booker were re-elected by big margins, campaigning in part on their criminal justice reform efforts. And in New Jersey, voters passed  a state constitutional amendment reforming the bail system that was championed by both Republican Gov. Chris Christie and the Drug Policy Alliance. If criminal justice reform can happen in places as diverse as Georgia, Texas, California and New Jersey, then it should be possible to bring similar reforms to the federal level in Washington, D.C. There are a number of good bipartisan bills in the U.S. Senate that should be our starting point. One of the most important is the ""Smarter Sentencing Act,"" authored by conservative Sen. Mike Lee and liberal Sen. Dick Durbin. It would reduce mandatory sentences for nonviolent drug offenses. Senators Rand Paul and Cory Booker have also introduced important, bipartisan legislation. Even more than the current debate in the Senate, however, the approaching 2016 election season offers the opportunity for the American people to make criminal justice reform a priority. Voters should demand of each presidential and gubernatorial candidate a vision for reducing incarceration and cutting prison spending while improving public safety and helping nonviolent offenders live full, productive lives within the law. In the interest of ensuring criminal justice reform is part of the conversation about who should be our next president, we will convene a national summit on criminal justice reform on March 26, 2015, under the banner of #cut50 -- a new bipartisan initiative of Rebuild the Dream, which Van leads, to help cut the prison population in half over the next 10 years. Our overreliance on prisons has failed America. It is past time for both political parties to come together and fix a bad system of their own making.

Colbert -- very much in character -- noted in a university release that ""The Colbert Report"" is no stranger to Washington, D.C., though the city may need to brace itself. ""Washington has been the Report's second home, and I will be returning on Monday to show it the same affection the British did in 1812,"" Colbert said. Obama will be the second member of the first family to be interviewed by Colbert: Michelle Obama appeared on the program in 2012. GW students got the chance to vie for free tickets to the taping this week, before Obama was announced as the show's guest. Obama's visit to the university's campus will be his sixth, according to a university release. Colbert previously appeared at the university's Lisner Auditorium in 2007 to discuss his book ""I Am America (And So Can You!)"" with the late Tim Russert of NBC News.

"(CNN) -- Walmart is editing a commercial after viewers complained its use of the line ""I can't breathe"" brings to mind the case of Eric Garner, who died at the hands of a police officer after yelling those words. The ad features an African-American father and daughter sitting on a couch, discussing the perks of a Walmart family mobile plan. Unbeknownst to the daughter, the father made a stop at the retail chain earlier and bought her a cell phone. When he hands it to her, she screams and throws her hands around his neck in a tight hug. ""I can't breathe,"" the father jokingly mouths. Those three words have become a rallying cry for protesters nationwide following the July 17 death of Garner in a videotaped incident in New York City. In the footage, a white officer from the New York Police Department puts him in a chokehold that sends him tumbling to the ground. Garner, who is black, says ""I can't breathe"" a few times during the incident. He dies shortly after. A grand jury said Wednesday it will not indict the officer, Daniel Pantaleo, sending outraged protesters rallying against the decision. Walmart said Thursday that it has received some criticism over the ad, and it will revise it as a result. ""We're re-editing as we speak based on feedback we've received,"" the retailer posted on Twitter. ""We can see how the ad could be viewed differently today than when it first aired."" Danielle Ramos, who lives in New York City, was one of the people who tweeted Walmart about the ad. ""Walmart, did you really just air a commercial in NY where a little black girl has her arm around her dad's neck and he says #icantbreathe?"" she asked. Ramos said she's glad the retailer is rethinking the ad. ""The decision to edit it given the current climate is appreciated,"" Ramos said. ""I don't think it was a huge company intentionally being insensitive. I just think maybe they weren't aware just how deeply affected this nation is by all this."" But Eric Lewis said there's nothing wrong with the ad. ""It's a cute and happy commercial .... Lord people,"" the Richmond, Virginia, resident tweeted. Walmart said the ad has been on air since earlier this year, but it did not give a specific date.","The ad features an African-American daughter giving her dad a tight hug .

"Seven decades after being sent to Nazi concentration camps, survivors of the Holocaust will have the chance to get retribution -- from the government of France. France signed an agreement Monday with U.S. authorities to pay $60 million to Holocaust survivors transported to concentration camps, said Arnaud Guillois, a spokesman for the French Embassy in Washington. Patrizianna Sparacino-Thiellay, France's ambassador at large for human rights in charge of Holocaust issues, said Monday the agreement ""is a further contribution to recognizing France's commitment to facing up to its historic responsibilities. ""The reparation programs set up immediately after the war, and those introduced in the past fifteen years, are the tangible symbol of the official acknowledgment in 1995 of France's 'imprescriptible debt' towards the victims of the Holocaust,"" Sparacino-Thiellay said. A joint statement from France's Foreign Affairs Ministry and the U.S. State Department noted that the accord shows the close relationship between the two countries. ""In this year marked by the commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the Allied landings in Normandy and Provence, this agreement further strengthens the historic friendship and ties between our two countries,"" the statement said. U.S. officials created the fund and will administer it. But Americans aren't the only ones eligible for compensation; victims living in nations that haven't signed Holocaust compensation agreements also can benefit, according to the embassy spokesman. A few thousand people may be eligible for some of the fund, according to Guillois. This fund had been years in the making, and had come under intense pressure inside the United States, including efforts by American lawmakers to bar the SNCF, the French national railway, from bidding in U.S. markets until the issue is resolved. One piece of proposed legislation, the Holocaust Rail Justice Act, stated that more than 75,000 Jews and thousands of others were moved from France to Nazi concentration camps on SNCF trains. Those transported included U.S. citizens and their relatives, as well as American military pilots shot down during the war. An official at France's national railway declined to comment on the agreement when reached by CNN. Yet Guillois explained that the SNCF was not considered liable for the deportation of Jews in France, because it was commissioned by France's Vichy government -- which was formed after the armistice and collaborated with the Nazis -- to do so. This isn't the first time that France, which was invaded by Nazi Germany in 1940 before reaching an armistice agreement with Adolf Hitler's government later that year, has borne some responsibility for the Holocaust. As Guillois noted, this latest agreement is one of several mechanisms by the French government to compensate Holocaust victims since 1946, the year after World War II ended. The Nazis systematically killed more than 6 million Jews during the Holocaust, along with millions of other people who were religious and ethnic minorities, political dissidents, homosexuals or disabled, in death camps situated primarily in Germany and Eastern Europe.","Embassy spokesman: France signed an agreement with U.S. authorities on Monday .

"The Pacific Island nation of Kiribati may be the first country to disappear under the rising sea levels of climate change. Its people fear their homeland may become the world's next Atlantis. As our boat nears the shore, the dark shadows beneath the sea sharpen into focus. Chiseled coral stones, organized neatly into rows, glisten from the reef of this shallow cove. We are drifting over the foundations of the surrendered neighborhoods of Tebunginako. The village was once home to more than 200 households, but today, it lies beneath several meters of turquoise water. ""We used to swim out there to see the ships when we were boys. They'd tie them up to the coconut trees just over here,"" explains the Mayor, pointing enthusiastically as we coast over the remains of his town. Locals say Tebunginako was once the island's main harbor -- before the rising sea swallowed its coast. Now stumps of dead coconut trees line the lagoon, their tips peaking out from the water like little grave stones of a civilization lost. The extreme coastal erosion of Tebunginako is becoming increasingly common in Kiribati, a South Pacific nation of 33 islands strung along the equator. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has identified Kiribati as one of the six Pacific Island countries most threatened by rising sea-levels. The report claims that, due to coastal erosion and freshwater contamination, Kiribati could become uninhabitable as early as 2050. ""Right now we're experiencing total inundation of areas that previously were not vulnerable to normal tides,"" says Andrew Teem, Kiribati's Senior Adviser on Climate Change. ""We're getting something called King Tides -- extremely high tides. These were non-existent when I was a boy."" A large number of Kiribati's citizens are already internally displaced from climate-related disasters, and many have fled to the capitol island, South Tarawa. Today, half of Kiribati's population crowds onto South Tarawa's tiny crescent of land, making it one of the most densely populated areas on earth, mirroring the population density of Tokyo or London. Unless birthrates or internal displacement are curbed, the population of South Tarawa is expected to double by 2030. ""Like any developing island state, our population is quite young and developing at a very high rate, which already strains our fresh water supply,"" Teem explains. ""Climate change and the rising sea exacerbate a problem we already have with regards to our water resources."" This week, representatives from 190 countries will gather in Lima, Peru for the twentieth session of the U.N. Climate Change Conference. The Lima conference will lay the groundwork for a climate treaty at the end of 2015, for implementation by 2020. But for low-lying island nations like Kiribati, these commitments may not materialize soon enough. For communities like Tebunginako, these treaties are already long overdue. ""Climate change has major implications for our people today, not in the future like some other countries,"" explains Teem. Kiribati's government has pursued various adaptation initiatives over the last decade. These efforts range from employment-related migration programs with Australia and New Zealand to the exploration of man-made floating islands. This year, Kiribati finalized a purchase of a plot of land in Fiji that it hopes to use in the future. But the people of Kiribati are unwilling to abandon their homes without a fight. In addition to their local efforts, they are challenging the root of the problem, global carbon-emissions, at the international level. The government of Kiribati, along with a coalition of other small island states, has been lobbying for binding carbon-emissions treaties. They have also supported the concept of ""climate change reparations,"" or compensation to non-industrialized developing countries for the climate-related damages caused by the industrialized powers. In the past month, breakthroughs were made on both fronts. The United States and China -- the world's largest emitters of carbon -- announced plans to cut emissions over the next two decades. At the recent G20 conference, several nations joined President Obama in committing billions of dollars to the United Nation's Green Climate Fund, which will support developing nations in combating the effects of climate change. While the government of Kiribati welcomed this news, the measures are only a first step towards addressing their national needs. Environmental groups have criticized the developments, calling the measures ""a drop in the ocean."" ""Climate change is something we were not responsible for. If we were responsible for this fate, that would be a different story all together,"" responds Teem, on the issues of climate change reparations and carbon emission cuts. ""We are very simple people with very simple needs, but we do not want to be faced with something that is not entirely of our own doing."" As the sun sets in Tebunginako, the Mayor guides us to the shore of the town's two remaining structures, a Church and a traditional community center, known as a maneaba. The tall structures jet out defiantly from the middle of the lagoon, fortified only by leaking sandbags and battered seawalls. ""We struggle to maintain them as a remembrance of Tebunginako,"" explains the Mayor. ""These places are important to our people because of their religion and because it was the last place they were all together."" When asked about his people's future, he clings to their past. ""We are very scared, and we need help,"" he shrugs. ""We believe in our government and their strong voice to the world, but we are still waiting for the world to reply."" ""We used to swim out there as children,"" he repeats quietly, his gaze shifting blankly to the ocean. ""And tie the boats to the coconut trees...""","The Pacific Island nation of Kiribati was once home to more than 200 households .

"As Joey Donner in the 1999 film ""10 Things I Hate About You,"" Andrew Keegan attracted his fair share of fans. Now, he's attracting converts.

The former teen heartthrob said his spiritual journey began after he and some friends were attacked on Venice Beach in 2011. The incident happened around the same time as the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, and Keegan said he began to see an odd series of occurrences that led him to start Full Circle. ""I had a moment where I was looking at a streetlamp, and it exploded,"" he said. ""That was a weird coincidence. At a ceremony, a heart-shaped rose quartz crystal was on the altar, and synchronistically, this whole thing happened. It's a long story, but basically the crystal jumped off the altar and skipped on camera. That was weird."" It all prompted him to conclude that ""the mission is to take the war out of our story, which is essentially peace but activated peace,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- The march music stops and the camera screens come to life as 70 small black cannons fire a shower of golden confetti high above the crowds. Tumbling through the air, the shiny plume swirls in a fleeting dance, covering the ground in a sprawling blanket of gold stars. It was with this rain of 54,000 star-shaped gold confetti, part of his ""Celebration"" installation, that Algerian artist Slimane Rais chose to mark the opening of the 11th edition of the Dakar Biennale of Contemporary African Art (Dak'Art) on May 10. The month-long event is Africa's major contemporary art stage. Its main exhibition, housed on an industrial wasteland on the southeastern edge of the bustling Senegalese capital, has brought together 61 well-established and emerging artists from all across the continent and the African diaspora. Across three old warehouses, a diverse array of paintings, sculptures, videos, installations and mixed-media work leads audiences into an immersive journey of forms and ideas that seek to go beyond aesthetics. ""We are in an era where art should speak for something,"" says Ugochukwu-Smooth Nzewi, one of the Biennale's three curators. ""There's a crisis in Nigeria for example with Boko Haram -- you expect artists to respond to that because artists act as seers of society,"" he adds. ""[To] engage with the real issues of our time, like inequality or social conditions, without the work losing the sublime quality that makes art art -- it's very important."" True, shortcomings such as last-minute schedule changes and repairs, as well as missing work (the area supposed to host the etching prints of Julie Mehretu, the world-renowned Ethiopian artist and one of Dak'Art's biggest names, was left glaringly empty at the time of the opening) took some shine off this year's opening event, but also added a real sense of adventure. Yet, this is still a powerful showcase, with several highlights reaffirming the renewed energy of Africa's contemporary artists and their growing relevance in the global stage. Compelling creations . One of them is ""The End of Eating Everything,"" a captivating video installation by Wangechi Mutu. In a small darkened room, the Kenyan artist uses a Medusa-like creature that obsessively devours everything around her to paint a grim picture of today's mass consumerism. Likewise, Cameroonian Justine Gaga deploys giant anthropomorphic gas canisters in ""Indignation"" to denounce issues like fundamentalism, racism and corruption and to call for resistance. In ""Corps en Resonance,"" Tunisian Naziha Mestaoui invites visitors to interact with three crystal bowls filled with water to produce hypnotizing sounds and eerie light reflections. This is a crowd-pleaser, just like the intriguing work by Kenya-based Sam Hopkins, who playfully mixes real and imaginary NGO logos to question the role and motivations of charity groups. Similarly, Angolan Kiluanji Kia Henda imagines an African NGO that gives grants to Western countries in a series of manipulated images that challenge assumptions over international aid. All the exhibited work has been brought together under the central theme of ""Producing the Common,"" an ambitious attempt to showcase art that engages with the real issues of today. Or, as the biennial's three curators -- Nzewi, Elise Atangana and Abdelkader Damani -- put it, ""to connect politics and aesthetics in a vigorous and sustained way."" A more tangible link, however, is that all participating artists are exhibiting in Dakar for the first time. ""The real value of Dak'Art is that it serves as a platform of visibility for African artists, so it makes no sense if you keep on repeating the same set of people over the different iterations,"" says Nzewi. ""In a way, with this edition we are set to reposition Dak'Art going forward."" New faces . One of these newcomers is Milumbe Haimbe, a Zambian artist exploring the representation of cultural minorities in popular media. Here, she uses comic book illustrations to challenge the stereotypical portrayal of women in contemporary graphic novels, as well as the absence of female black superheroes in the genre. ""My protagonist in this particular comic is female, black, young and gay,"" says Haimbe, introducing ""Ananiya,"" an undercover agent operating in a not-too-distant future, where the whole world is controlled by a powerful corporation. ""The idea is to help different people to relate to different symbolisms,"" says Haimbe. ""A lot of the heroes in popular media, whether they are comics, movies or novels, are heterosexual white males -- nothing wrong with that but I think we need to see another alternative,"" she adds. ""You know, the world is made out of so many people."" Like other art festivals, Dak'art gives out awards to participating artists. Haimbe herself was one of the 10 winners, scooping the ""Prix de la Fondation Blachere."" The grand prize was shared by Algerian artist Driss Ouadahi, for his ""Unter Uns"" painting, and Nigerian Olu Amoda, for his ""Sunflower"" sculpture, a compelling creation made of repurposed nails and spoons in Lagos's junkyards. ""The sunflower comprises of several small flowers and when they come together they glow under the sun,"" says Amoda. ""So I'm trying to look at the positive signs of the interdependence of Africans ... because the interpretation of Africa is such that it's conflict and famine."" Rich history . Dak'Art first appeared in the calendars of art aficionados in the early 1990s, initially as an event dedicated to literature and then as a biennial of visual arts that welcomed artists from all over the world. By 1996, however, at a time when few young African artists were able to break into the international market, Dak'Art had already found a new focus as a pan-African contemporary art biennial. The transformation helped it distinguish itself from other large-scale recurring exhibitions but also connected it to a longer history of 20th century black consciousness, where Senegal played a leading role -- it's hard to start talking today about Dak'Art without the name of Leopold Sedar Senghor, Senegal's first president, popping up. A poet, writer and an avid art collector himself, Senghor famously staged the first World Festival of Black Arts in Dakar in 1966, bringing together artists, dancers, writers and musicians from all over Africa, Europe, North and South America and the Caribbean. Today, as more and more African artists are finally making a name outside the continent, Dak'Art has become the main platform for Africa and its diaspora to engage with the international market, attracting the usual crowds of artists, curators, critics and art historians. Similar to previous editions, this year's biennial doesn't start and end with its five main events. Even though the local public here seems to be largely unaware of them, there are some 200 parallel exhibitions running simultaneously across and outside Dakar, giving the opportunity to 500 artists to showcase their work in a wide array of spaces ranging from art galleries and hotel lobbies to bookstores and restaurants. Back in the main exhibition, curator Abdelkader Damani walks past the massive installations dotting the outdoor space, stopping every now and then to hug and talk to artists crossing his path. He says part of Dak'Art's goals this year were to help launch the careers of unknown artists and also help deal with the absence of an active market for contemporary art in the continent. ""There's just one problem with the African art in the continent: there are no local markets for this kind of art,"" he says. ""There are not that many institutions who help,"" he adds. ""Artists need to go to Europe or America to find someone who can buy the work and help and do the exhibitions,"" continues Damani. ""I know that what we are doing here is going to open this way to make all the people in Africa understand that."" The Dakar Biennale runs until June 8.","The 11th Dakar Biennale is currently underway .

"Staten Island, New York (CNN) -- On a chilly morning after thousands took to the streets to protest yet another grand jury's refusal to indict a white police officer for killing an unarmed black man, tourists vied for spots on the Staten Island Ferry to photograph the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. The ferry is the only way to get from lower Manhattan -- without a car, of course -- to the north shore of New York's least populated and whitest borough. On the other side of the harbor, just blocks from the ferry terminal, is Tompkinsville, the neighborhood where Eric Garner lived and died. Garner, 43, was a father of six and a grandfather. He died July 17 after police Officer Daniel Pantaleo tackled him to the ground in a department-banned chokehold during an arrest for selling cigarettes illegally. Garner's death occurred weeks before Ferguson, Missouri, Police Officer Darren Wilson shot unarmed teenager Michael Brown to death on August 9. A St. Louis County grand jury last week declined to indict Wilson, setting off days of unrest. On the journey from Manhattan, where hordes of protesters stopped traffic on Wednesday and Thursday, to the Staten Island street where Garner was killed, people were asked three questions. What do the deaths of Brown and Garner say about race in America? How would your life be different if you were of a different race or class? Do you believe justice is colorblind? Enoch Karim and his daughter Takeya sat on the Staten Island-bound ferry, watching tourists snap photos of the Statue of Liberty. The United States is not all it's made out to be, Karim said. The grand jury decision to not indict Pantaleo was not unexpected. ""We've become desensitized to these murders,"" said Karim, whose son was friends with Garner, known in the neighborhood as ""Big E."" ""It's business as usual in America."" ""It's bad,"" his 14-year-old daughter said. ""We die and they don't do anything about it."" Karim said his son and Garner sold ""loosie"" cigarettes to make a few dollars ""instead of stealing."" His son saw Garner die, he said. ""He said, 'Dad, I had to walk away. They killed Big E and I couldn't do anything about it.' "" Asked if life would be different if his race was different, Karim smiled. ""It's called the privileged race,"" he said. ""I'd probably be president."" Johannes Morken and his wife, May, on Wednesday stood near Rockefeller Center in Manhattan. They watched hundreds of protesters on the streets. On Thursday, waiting for the ferry, the couple visiting from Norway read a front-page newspaper article about the protests. ""Both these two guys are black and they were killed for small crimes,"" said Johannes Morken. ""Police use tough measures against unarmed black people. It looks like white policemen are trained to act like that."" ""Racism is more of a problem than we hoped it would be,"" he added. Garner's father, Ben Carr, has been holding an almost daily vigil near the makeshift shrine at the spot where his son died. ""I just want to make sure that people come here to honor and remember my son,"" he said. ""No violence. We live here."" Rage was on display on the streets of New York, but there was none of the looting and violence seen in Ferguson. To Twan Scholar, who knew Garner for 25 years, the sidewalk where his friend died is sacred ground. So many young black men are dying, he said. ""The government worries about all these other countries, but what about folks being killed by the police on our streets?"" he asked. Rodney Lee, who is Korean, has run Bay Beauty Supply on Bay Street for 15 years. As Pantaleo grabbed Garner in a chokehold, the officer and the man he took down nearly crashed through the window of Lee's shop. A memorial of white flowers, handwritten notes and burning candles marks the spot on a sidewalk where Garner uttered his last words: ""I can't breathe. I can't breathe."" ""Why do we have to be scared of the cops?"" Lee asked. Katie McCarthy has owned Book CafÃ© on Bay Street for three decades. She looked down the street at the people gathered around Garner's memorial and lamented that America was far from guaranteeing ""equal justice for all."" Outside a pharmacy on Victory Boulevard, Loretta Bevilacqua said the Garner case was not about race. Though Staten Island is more than three-quarters white, the north shore is more diverse. ""It's sad what happened but most people here get along,"" she said. The borough -- the only one not reachable by the city's subway system -- is home to many firefighters and police officers. On September 11, 2001, more than 250 Staten Islanders died when the World Trade Center towers fell. ""Justice is colorblind,"" Bevilacqua said. ""A lot of people don't care about race. But there are always some people who are prejudiced.""","Tompkinsville is the Staten Island neighborhood where Eric Garner lived and died .

"At least ten patients have been left permanently blind following botched cataract surgeries at an illegal medical camp in Punjab state, India, health officials say. The operations were carried out at a free, unofficial ""eye camp"" at Guru Nanak Charitable Hospital, Ghuman, organized by a non-government organization, Amritsar's deputy commissioner Ravi Bhagat told CNN. Sixty-two people, mostly of them aged over 60, had undergone cataract surgery at the camp, held on November 4-5, Anil Joshi, Punjab's Minister for Local Bodies, Medical Education and Research told CNN. Seventeen later complained of severe pain in their eyes, he said, and had subsequently been treated at an eye clinic at Amritsar's Government Medical College. Dr Karamjit Singh, an ENT specialist at Government Medical College who is now working to help the affected patients, said that of the 17 who approached the deputy  commissioner with complaints on December 3, 10 were now permanently blind. Three patients were receiving treatment -- one of whom regained their sight -- while four had left the hospital for personal reasons, despite their eyes being in very poor condition. Singh said the infections could have been caused unsterilized instruments or eyedrops, and it would be very hard to restore sight to those affected. Officials have launched an inquiry into the camp, and were trying to trace everyone who was operated on so they could be assessed by Singh, said Joshi. Medical camps, often run by non-government organizations, are commonplace in India, helping to bring healthcare to many poor people in rural areas who would otherwise be deprived of their services. They are usually approved by the Department of Health and Welfare. But Bhagat said that no such permissions had been granted to the eye camp, and its operations were illegal. He said a police report had been filed against the NGO and the doctors involved on the grounds of negligence, and other medical camps in the city had been told to halt operations while their permissions were reviewed. India's health sector has come in for harsh scrutiny in the wake of a rash of recent incidents in surgery camps. Earlier this week, officials in Odisha state announced an investigation after bicycle pumps were used to inflate the abdomens of 56 women undergoing sterilization surgery at a government-run community health center. And last month, a surgeon was arrested on charges of negligence and attempted culpable homicide in the deaths of a dozen women who had undergone sterilization operations at a mobile clinic in Chhattisgarh.

"(CNN) -- Pundit Glenn Reynolds recently wrote: ""So as I understand it, Atticus Finch is now the bad guy in ""To Kill A Mockingbird,"" because he doubted a story about rape."" How right he was. A story with a rape allegation carries an immediate electric charge. In Jim Crow's South, lynchings often came with a story of the victim having raped a white girl. With the energy of such a story, it wasn't too hard to whip up a fury strong enough to leave a man hanging from a tree. The ""rape propaganda"" was necessary to garner the emotions necessary to press the real, dark, agenda. Al Sharpton took a page out of the old South's playbook and brought us Tawana Brawley, who accused six white men of raping her. The story of white on black crime resonated, and it helped to promote a social justice agenda, but Tawana Brawley was no more a rape victim than two white women in Scottsboro, Alabama, who falsely accused nine black teenagers more than 80 years ago. What do these stories have in common? Someone had an agenda, and they knew that a rape story would put it on a rocket powered toboggan. And, therein lies the origin of today's ""rape culture"" frenzy. This is not to say that there are not unreported and unprosecuted sexual assaults. I have dear friends who suffered such injustice, and I believe their stories with every drop of blood in my body. I'll bet that nearly everyone knows someone who has a verifiably true story. But, is that really ""rape culture?"" What does that silly phrase mean? It means the same thing as Jim Crow stories of rape meant. It means the same thing that Tawana Brawley meant. It means that someone has an agenda, and they want to harness the emotional power of rape to promote it. Which brings us to the University of Virginia. When Sabrina Erdely's Rolling Stone story about a gang rape in a UVA frat house hit the presses, it went viral. Why? It was like a horror movie. I'll admit that when I read it, my own prejudices rose up, and I believed ""Jackie"" (the victim in the story). I thought of my friends who had been harmed and couldn't even begin to doubt that ""Jackie"" was telling the truth. Why wouldn't I believe her? The antagonists were a bunch of over-privileged white fraternity jerks from UVA, it seemed. The victim was yet another young woman who had had justice withheld. The story confirmed what I wanted to believe: that the elite run roughshod over the rest of us. It proved so much, and I ""knew"" which side was right. And it confirmed the bias of left-wing academics who have collectively decided that the ""war on boys"" must have more victims, because everything with a penis is a rapist. As the story burned, cries of ""rape culture"" started to sound less like fairy tales and more like factual reports. All of a sudden, embattled sexual harassment policies on college campuses started to look good, perhaps unquestionable. These policies that have been attacked by those who still believe in that quaint notion known as due process, and the tide started to turn. The Boston Globe recently ran the story of Patrick Whitt, who found himself falsely accused, and immediately judged guilty by mere suspicion. But then we had Jackie. Rape culture was real, after all! And then someone dared to question the story. Even I was aghast. How could he? This account was not published in some rag -- this was Rolling Stone, a publication of editorial ethics. Some schools of feminist thought consider questioning a victim to be utterly taboo. If she said it, then it must be true. Such is the mentality of those who would lynch Atticus Finch, or at least call for his disbarment, if he were practicing in modern day America. ""Jackie"" may not be Mayella Ewell, ""Mockingbird's"" faux victim. I wasn't there in that UVA frat house. But Jackie supposedly was. Nevertheless, the ""journalist"" who brought us the story has now been revealed to have been, at least, lazy and willfully blind to the holes in Jackie's story. She claims that she never asked the men in the story for their account of events because of an agreement with Jackie. And therein lie so many problems.

Patrick Whitt is the new Tom Robinson, the black man accused of the rape in ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" Due process loses, ethics are out the window, because there is an agenda, and it needs the fuel of a rape story. And who loses? The casualty list is still being compiled. Terrible journalism or not, maybe Jackie was telling the truth. Maybe she was lying. If she was lying, the UVA Greek system already paid a terrible price. If she was telling the truth, she won't ever be believed now. Why? Because Sabrina Erdely was so utterly void of journalistic ethics that she committed ""journalistic malpractice."" Because now, nobody will believe Jackie. And after Erdely's lazy journalism, the next girl who reports a rape might find it to be that much more difficult to get to justice. I don't know what Erdely's agenda was, but it wasn't responsible journalism. Responsible journalism is hard. It isn't public relations. A responsible journalist digs for the truth, she doesn't just take her subject's agenda and run with it.

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- The International Criminal Court has dropped charges against Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta -- the first sitting head of state to appear before the tribunal. Kenyatta, 53, faced five counts of crimes against humanity for allegedly orchestrating violence after a disputed presidential election seven years ago. ""I am very keen to run to my wife right now and tell her what is happening,"" he said on Twitter after the court dropped the charges Friday. ""To be sincere, we are very excited."" More than 1,000 people died when ethnic groups loyal to leading candidates torched homes and hacked rivals in violence that raged for months. Kenyatta, who backed then-incumbent Mwai Kibaki in that election, was accused of funding a local militia that conducted reprisal attacks. He has maintained that he is not guilty. Withdrawal follows a series of setbacks . This week, the court rejected the prosecution's request for an adjournment, giving it a week to either provide more evidence or drop the charges. In light of the court's mandate, Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said, she was left with no choice but to withdraw the charges. ""The evidence has not improved to such an extent that Mr. Kenyatta's alleged criminal responsibility can be proven beyond reasonable doubt,"" Bensouda said in a statement explaining her decision. Numerous adjournments . Bensouda has postponed the start of the trial numerous times, and accused the Kenyan government of withholding key documents in the case against its leader. ""Crucial documentary evidence regarding the 2007-2008 postelection violence ... can only be found in Kenya and is only accessible to the prosecution through the assistance of the government of Kenya,"" she said. ""This crucial assistance was ultimately not provided."" The defense has rejected the accusations. 'My conscience is clear' Shortly after she dropped the charges, Bensouda listed a series of setbacks the prosecution faced, including the exposure and harassment of protected witnesses. The Kenyan president has denied any links to the violence, and had pledged to cooperate with the court to clear his name. ""My conscience is clear, has been clear, and will remain forever clear that I am innocent of all the accusations leveled against me,"" Kenyatta said last month. He became the first sitting head of state to appear before the international court when he attended a status hearing last month at the court in The Hague, Netherlands. ICC withdrawal? The international court has also accused Deputy President William Ruto of orchestrating attacks in the 2007 election, which he denies. His trial started in September last year. The Kenyan parliament voted this year to withdraw from ICC jurisdiction after repeatedly calling on the court to drop the two leaders' cases. But a withdrawal would take a while to implement because it involves steps such as a formal notification to the United Nations. Bias accusations . The International Criminal Court was set up in 2002 to prosecute genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. The nation's previous administration reneged on a deal to set up a special tribunal to try suspects in the postelection violence, prompting the international court to step in. The African Union has urged the court to postpone cases against sitting leaders, accusing it of unfair treatment against African leaders. The international court has said it is not a substitute for domestic justice systems, and only intervenes if the national judicial system is either unwilling or unable to carry out justice. Rights groups have said the court is crucial in ensuring justice for everyone. CNN's Lillian Leposo contributed from Nairobi, and Faith Karimi wrote and reported from Atlanta.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- Misha Di Bono zips around town in her Infiniti sport-utility vehicle, breezy and unconcerned about the price of gas. Misha Di Bono says people used to make fun of her rolling billboard. She gets $500 a month and free gas. That's because she gets $500 a month -- plus free gas -- for turning her car into a rolling billboard for Jobing.com, the online recruiting company she works for. ""People used to tease me about the 'Jobing' mobile, and now they're like, 'Oh, we'll get Misha to drive,' "" she said, standing next to her decal-covered car. Jobing.com might be the most extreme example of how companies are helping employees during the current gas crunch. But with gas averaging more than $4 a gallon, more and more companies are trying to figure out incentives to help ease the pain at the pump for their employees.  Watch a rolling billboard for your company » . ""There's no question companies are feeling the pinch,"" said John Challenger, the chief executive officer of global outplacement company Challenger, Gray and Christmas. ""It's an important issue because no company wants to lose its people."" His firm recently surveyed about 100 human resources executives at white-collar and blue-collar companies. The survey found that 57 percent of the companies offer programs to help ease commutes. The most popular option was reducing the work week from five eight-hour days to four 10-hour days. Twenty-three percent of the companies polled have such an option, Challenger said.  Calculator: How much do you need to work to pay your gas? » . ""We're at a watershed time of how people go to work,"" he said. ""Maybe the gas crisis will be the real trigger."" Other incentives: Twenty percent of the companies offer carpools, and 18 percent pay for the cost of public transportation. Only 14 percent of the companies offer telecommuting options, the poll found. The survey reports that companies had seen a recent jump in carpooling of 43 percent and a 23 percent increase in the use of public transportation. Still, 31 percent of the companies saw no increase in their employees' commuting behaviors.  See gas prices around the country » . Some of the companies have had the incentives for years, but it's taken the soaring gas prices for employees to look more closely at the programs. ""It's something that is much more important than two years ago,"" Challenger said. ""It's hard to get away from, because you're constantly going back to the gas station."" He added, ""It's hitting people's radar screens now."" One company offering generous commuting benefits is online giant Yahoo, which rewards employees who organize carpools, ride bikes to work and take company shuttles to and from offices. Yahoo rewards these green-conscious commuters with free movie tickets, lunches, massages and other benefits. iReport: How is your company helping you . The company recently hired an ""employee transportation coordinator"" to help devise even more incentives. ""We've really been listening to our employees to make sure we help them find ways to make the cost of the commute a little less excessive,"" said Barbary Brunner, a Yahoo vice president. But it is the Jobing.com vehicle that is most eye-popping. Company spokesman Joe Cockrell says the company started the rolling billboard cars in 2001, but only three executives took part in it. But now, 60 percent of its 270 employees nationwide drive the cars.   Watch a shift from marketing ploy to employee benefit » . ""This year, for the first time, we've had a long waiting list for our wrap,"" Cockrell says. ""It's basically a huge sticker that goes on your car and should last in theory about three to four years."" It costs the company about $3,000 to $4,000 to turn the cars into rolling billboards. They do have rules: The car can't be older than three years, and employees must take a driving safety course and have clean driving records. Once the cars are wrapped, employees shouldn't flip the bird at other drivers. The company did have to ""unwrap"" one employee's car because he got too many speeding tickets. Cockrell says the program has proved to be a huge win-win. ""These are mobile billboards, and wherever our employees go, so does that billboard."" Di Bono, who works in community relations, says she loves it, too. She says the cost of filling her tank has doubled in recent years. Now, her company pays her to drive her car. ""They pay for everything,"" she said. ""They pay for me to go to all my appointments and anything I want to do on my own time."" She added, ""You'd be a fool not to take advantage of it."" Although many people across the nation are seeking help from their offices, an iReporter in West Virginia recently stopped using his company car and began using his old clunker again. Maurice Alouf's company paid for his V-8 Chrysler sedan, but he says it guzzled gas on his 80-mile round-trip commute. The company didn't offer a gas allowance, and it was costing him more than $60 a week to fill up. So he dusted off his 50-mile-per-gallon Geo Metro. ""It's not fun,"" he said.

"When Shakira became the first Colombian this week to get her name on a world-renowned monument to the entertainment industry -- the Hollywood Walk of Fame -- the 34-year-old recording artist recalled what her mother told her at age 7. ""One day, Shaki, your name will be here,"" her mother said when the two and a family friend visited Hollywood for the first time 27 years ago. For Shakira, the star marked a personal triumph -- as an artist and a Latina. ""If by coincidence you happen to look down to the ground and you see this star, remember that it belongs to each one of you, because it carries the name of a Hispanic woman that, like you, dreams and works and works and dreams every day,"" Shakira said during a public ceremony on Hollywood Boulevard, with her mom and the same friend present. As the latest celebrity to get a terrazzo star, trimmed with bronze, on the sidewalks of Hollywood, Shakira joins a small but growing rank of minority performers making a dent in an overall industry that some criticize as not inviting enough to African-Americans, Latinos and Asians. In fact, of the 2,354 stars on Hollywood sidewalks, only 3.4% of them belong to Hispanics such as Shakira, a CNN analysis shows. The figure is 5.1% for African-Americans and a mere 0.4% for Asians, according to an analysis of the stars on the Walk of Fame. Those figures fall short when compared with those minorities' representation in the nation's overall population: 16% for Hispanics, 13% for African-Americans and about 5% for Asians. List: Minority celebs on Walk of Fame . To be sure, the Walk of Fame functions as a commercial attraction and publicity device, but given the international attention it receives whenever a prominent artist such as Shakira receives a star, the Walk is also a major indicator of industry trends and success. Hollywood analysts say they aren't surprised at how the Walk lacks minorities, though its sponsor and operator, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, says it has been working hard to improve diversity in an attraction that stretches for blocks throughout Hollywood. ""The numbers are low,"" said Andrew Weaver, an Indiana University assistant professor in the department of telecommunications and an expert in race and media. ""The Walk of Fame reflects what we're seeing in Hollywood in general."" Hollywood's overall shortcomings in including more minorities -- and representing them as more than stereotypes -- are a longstanding problem that has been roundly decried by minority advocacy groups and many performers. Still, the chamber says its committee that selects star honorees balances numerous factors in its annual process, including race, gender, nationality, genre of performance and industry type. The 2,354 stars on the Walk line both sides of Hollywood Boulevard and Vine Street -- the heart of Hollywood -- and the chamber's annual 24 or so induction ceremonies are broadcast around the world. ""We are equal opportunity star givers!"" Leron Gubler, president and CEO of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, said in a written response to questions from CNN. The stars honor celebrities in five categories: motion pictures, television, radio, recording and live theater/performance. ""The committee tries to select candidates from each of the five categories, so with all of the different factors as well as the makeup of who has been nominated, it is a challenge to balance all factors,"" Gubler said. ""Since day one, we have encouraged minorities to apply,"" Gubler said about the Walk, which opened in 1961. ""When the Walk of Fame was created, some of the first stars included Anna May Wong, Dolores Del Rio, Cantinflas, Hattie McDaniel and many others. The committee does try to ensure that minorities are represented in the selections, but there is no set mandatory ratio."" A CNN analysis bears out Gubler's assertions and shows an upward trend of minority representation on the Walk over recent decades. Latinos grew from 1.9% in 1980, 2.2% in 1990, 2.8% in 2000, to 3.2% in 2010. African-Americans showed similar growth: 1.6% in 1980, 2.3% in 1990, 4.7% in 2000 and 5.1% in 2010. Asians posted marginal increases: 0.20% in 1980, 0.22% in 1990, 0.41% in 2000, and 0.43% in 2010. On one level, the Walk is a marketing tool. ""The Hollywood Walk of Fame is undoubtedly one of the most successful marketing ideas ever produced,"" the chamber touts on its website. The marketing aspect -- in which a celebrity sometimes gets a star timed with the release of a new project -- is partly reflected in how the chamber requires a $30,000 ""sponsorship fee,"" often paid by a studio, recording label or even a group of fans, chamber officials said. The fee is for the lifetime maintenance of the star, its production, a replica plaque and ceremony costs, officials said. ""Of course, it's a promotional tool. That's why studios and networks look for it,"" Hollywood publicist Michael Levine said. Still, the selection process is a serious-minded affair, according to the Walk's gatekeepers. A star is awarded after a lengthy process in which hundreds of nomination applications are sent to the Hollywood chamber, and then its Walk of Fame committee selects the winners, with the approval of the chamber's board of directors. The names also are submitted to the city of Los Angeles' Board of Public Works Department. Sometimes, several annual nominations must be made before a nominee finally receives a star, chamber officials said. The chamber has other criteria for who gets a star: professional achievement, longevity of five years or more, contributions to the community and the guarantee that the celebrity will attend the dedication ceremony. An honoree also has to agree to be nominated, which may be a factor in why not all major celebrities have a star. Sometimes, a performer doesn't want one, such as Julia Roberts. Other notable A-listers without one include George Lucas, Robert Redford, Angelina Jolie, Woody Allen and Leonardo DiCaprio. By the end of 2011 -- with a few more minority celebrities scheduled to be honored this year -- the Walk of Fame will have 77 stars overall given to Latinos, 119 stars to African-Americans or African-American ensembles (three of those performers -- Nat ""King"" Cole, Lena Horne and Sarah Vaughn -- have a second star, but they are counted only once), and only 10 stars to Asians, according to the chamber. When asked about the dearth of Asian artists on the Walk of Fame, Gubler stated: ""There have been relatively few nominations for Asian entertainers. Someone has to be nominated by a sponsor in order to be considered with a star. The issue must be pursued by a nominator. The committee can only consider from the pool of candidates that have been nominated."" A recent decade-by-decade analysis of the stars on the Walk of Fame shows that the 1990s were a boom decade for African-Americans, when 49 stars were awarded to them. During the 1980s, they secured 24 stars. From 2000 to the end of 2011, the number will be 22. Latinos, however, have prospered from 2000 to the end of 2011: Nineteen stars were awarded, including four this year alone, according to a CNN analysis. That compares with 18 during the 1990s and 11 during the 1980s. Only one Asian -- actor Philip Ahn, who played wise Master Kan in the TV series ""Kung Fu"" -- received a star in the 1980s. Five Asians received stars in the 1990s, but only one (Jackie Chan) has been placed on the Walk since 2000, a CNN analysis shows. It was the recent success of Latinos that caught the attention of several Hollywood analysts. That trend comes as the 2010 U.S. Census put the burgeoning Latino population at the nation's No. 2 racial group for the first time ever, displacing African-Americans. On Tuesday, two-time Grammy and seven-time Latin Grammy winner Shakira Isabel Mebarak Ripoll -- known professionally as Shakira -- received a star for her accomplishments as a singer, songwriter, musician, record producer, dancer and philanthropist, the chamber said. It's no secret that studios and record labels alike are hoping to find additional revenues in the rapidly growing Latino market. ""One of the ways to get Latinos into the movie theaters is getting Latino stars,"" said Steven Ross, a University of Southern California history professor and author of ""Hollywood Left and Right: How Movie Stars Shaped American Politics."" ""Hollywood is also thinking about global markets: Central American and Latin markets. A majority of Hollywood revenue is coming from international revenue. It's a much more significant part, more important to the studios' bottom line now that it ever has been before,"" Ross said. Still, Ross wasn't surprised by the low minority representation on the Walk of Fame, he said. ""It's probably appropriate to the history of Hollywood, which has mainly been playing to (a) mainstream audience, which is a white audience,"" Ross said. ""Just remember, this is not the consciousness-raising industry. This is the money-making industry. They will always follow the money trail. If they see more Latinos going to movies, they'll feature more Latino stars."" In the end, that reality may put more minorities in Hollywood -- and on its Walk of Fame. ""Very simple,"" Ross said. ""More minority audiences, more minority stars.""","CNN analysis: Minorities are underrepresented on the Hollywood Walk of Fame .

"Tacloban, Philippines (CNN) -- Anyone who visits Tacloban would be struck by the resilience of its people, many of whom lost everything -- family, friends, homes -- when Typhoon Haiyan battered the central Philippines a year ago. But imagine if you were them for a moment: you're told another storm, almost as powerful, is now heading for you. It's a horrifying prospect. INTERACTIVE: See the latest satellite and path of the storm . This is a population used to frequent tropical storms and that was one of the problems in November 2013. So many people thought they could ride out the storm but didn't account for the deadly floodwaters from the storm surge that followed. And what followed has been well documented -- entire communities flattened and decomposing bodies strewn along the side of roads. A death toll that eventually exceeded 5,000 of this country's most impoverished souls. Nearly everyone here lost someone. Barely 12 months later and the people of Tacloban, a name that will be forever associated with this disaster, have only started to recover, with many schools and homes rebuilt, businesses reopened and the scars of lost relatives and friends beginning to heal. The current storm in question -- Typhoon Hagupit -- may not yet hit Tacloban, such is the chilling unpredictability of these weather systems, but the prospect of another massive storm so soon after Haiyan is enough to alarm people here. And that has spurred many to act. ""I heard about the new storm on television,"" Charity Hilaria, a young mother, told CNN from outside her modest home on the edge of a dirt road into Tacloban. ""It scared me, I remembered last year,"" she added. As she cradled her weeks-old son, she told us that her family would be evacuating and spending the next couple of nights in a hotel. ""We have to hide somewhere to be safe."" Last year, she said they didn't understand the dangers of a storm surge because the government hadn't warned them. Hilaria's home was completely destroyed by Haiyan. Her new one -- little more than a rickety wooden shack -- took six months to complete, and only after they managed to get financial assistance from one of the many NGOs and foundations active in the region. While the safety of her family was the priority, she appeared resigned to losing her second home. All they can do is tie down the corrugated iron roof. Asked whether she'd consider leaving Tacloban for good, her sister, Christina, interjected: ""No, this is where we grew up. We've been living here for almost 30 years, so it's hard for us to leave somewhere and start a new life."" Unfortunately, many of the homes of Tacloban's poorest rebuilt in the wake of Haiyan are little more than shanty-like structures located in areas extremely vulnerable to flooding and storm surges. The local government initially tried to ban them from these areas, but they eventually relented, such was the pressure to build new homes in the wake of Haiyan. At one school on the outskirts of Tacloban City, hundreds of families sought shelter in a school, setting up makeshift camps along corridors outside classrooms labeled ""Science lab"" or ""English,"" and inside a massive sports hall. This is one of more than 60 evacuation centers dotted around the area. As we walked into the sports hall, we were greeted by hundreds of smiling faces -- mainly children, who clearly viewed this as an adventure. One middle-aged woman told us she'd brought all 13 of her children along with her. Another young mother said her husband insisted they leave their home despite the threat of losing their possessions to opportunist looters. She said memories of the Haiyan prompted them to look for somewhere safe to shelter. As we moved towards the San Jose neighborhood, one of the worst-hit areas of Tacloban last year, the scars of Haiyan were evident, a single palm tree stood defiantly on the beach alongside a group of wrecked wooden shacks -- once the homes of entire families. This is a particularly poor neighborhood that sits along the water's edge. Many residents like Ramil Arania, 40, have opted to evacuate too, though the police reportedly have orders to arrest anyone who ignores compulsory evacuation orders for this area anyway. With the incongruous sight of a young boy surfing in the background, Arania told us he and his family were inside when the waves started to lash their home during last year's storm surge. ""We were lucky, because the water made a hole in our wall that created a pocket for the water to pass through and not collapse it,"" he said. ""We managed to get to the second floor -- if it wasn't for that hole, it would have collapsed and we'd have been swept away. ""And now we pray that this new storm just disappears."" While there's a very real fear that last year could happen again, the situation in Tacloban is calm. The police and military are deployed here alongside an impressive number of foreign NGOs and even soldiers from South Korea's military. The feared run on supplies doesn't seem to have materialized -- yet. While some businesses have boarded up and closed, others, including gas stations, don't have long queues of people anxious to stock up.","Year after Typhoon Haiyan, people of Tacloban are again braced for a tropical storm .

"They had been in Nepal for a week trying to reach Thorong La Pass, 17,769 feet above sea level, when they were caught in a snowstorm, unable to make it to the nearest village. Avalanches roared down the mountain. Jeremy Aerts and his girlfriend May Wong pressed on: Extreme hiking enthusiasts, they had committed to making it all the way through. For some people, the idea of facing such obstacles -- especially voluntarily -- seems crazy. And yet many in the extreme hiking community wouldn't have it any other way. The new film ""Wild,"" based on the memoir by Cheryl Strayed, chronicles a grueling solo hike along 1,100 miles of the Pacific Crest Trail, on the border with Mexico, after Strayed's divorce and the death of her mother. The movie, which hits theaters Friday, might encourage more travelers to try extreme hiking. Aerts, 30, a GIS analyst from Pittsburgh, describes that night in Nepal this past spring as the closest he has ever been to death. Despite being unable to see 10 feet ahead of them, Aerts and Wong continued. ""At one point the wind was so strong it knocked me off my feet,"" said Aerts. ""We had to break into an abandoned cabin just before dark to spend the night with our guide and another trekking group."" The payoff came the next day when the couple reached the tiny village of Muktinath, surrounded by Himalayan peaks. ""It was one of the most beautiful places I've ever had the chance to see,"" he said. And that, in a nutshell, is why Aerts hikes. ""I love the sense of adventure and challenge that it presents,"" he said. ""I like the idea of never really knowing what to expect around the next corner."" Mohit Samant, a 27-year-old software engineer from Kansas City, Kansas, got a similar feeling about hiking when he visited Guatemala a year ago in his most memorable of many hikes. He had half a mind to quit midway through his hike through the Pacaya volcano due to the incredibly steep terrain, but the  hikers with him motivated him to continue to the top. Ultimately, he said it was the best hiking excursion he has done. He was able to admire views of three other nearby volcanoes: Agua, Fuego and Acatenango, making the whole experience -- three hours on foot -- well worth it.

"Belgrade, Serbia (CNN) -- After more than 15 years in hiding, onetime Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladic was in a Belgrade jail Friday to face charges that he presided over Europe's worst massacre since World War II. Mladic was the highest-ranking fugitive to remain at large after the conflicts that accompanied the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s. His arrest followed a three-year investigation, President Boris Tadic announced in a dramatic news conference Thursday morning. Tadic told CNN's ""Connect the World"" that he expected Mladic to be transferred to the U.N. war crimes tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ""within seven days."" He said Serbian authorities are still investigating who aided Mladic during his decade and a half on the run, but he called allegations that the country's military sheltered him ""rubbish."" Notorious Hutu militia leader captured . ""At the end of the day, he was protected by a very small group of people from his family,"" Tadic said. He acknowledged that Mladic may have been aided by military officers early on, ""but at the end of that process, I don't believe that,"" Tadic said. Mladic's lawyer, Milos Saljic, said Mladic's hearing was halted and rescheduled for Friday when he could not address the judge ""because of his physical and psychological condition."" Saljic called the ex-general ""a ruin of a man"" who has suffered two heart attacks and three strokes since 1996. ""He is no longer the monumental personality he used to be,"" Saljic said. He said doctors would evaluate whether Mladic is fit to return to court on Friday. Hundreds of riot police patrolled central Belgrade as the 69-year-old Mladic made his initial appearance on war crimes charges in a special Belgrade court. One squad chased away a crowd of 100 to 200 people, including one man who waved a Serbian flag, but they were far outnumbered by other people eating dinner or otherwise enjoying a warm spring night. The former Yugoslav army officer was the commanding general of Bosnian Serb forces during the 1992-95 war that followed Bosnia-Herzegovina's secession from Yugoslavia. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia has charged him with leading a genocidal campaign against Bosnia's Muslim and Croat populations, including ""direct involvement"" in the 1995 killings of nearly 8,000 men and boys in the Muslim enclave of Srebrenica -- the worst European massacre since the Holocaust. However, Mladic remains a hero to some Serbs, and small outbursts of anger were seend in Belgrade late Thursday. A passenger in a speeding car hurled a full beer can at a Serbian television truck, while another driver shouted, ""I like Ratko Mladic"" and an obscenity as he passed the courthouse. After midnight, three men stood beneath the building, clapping and chanting Mladic's name. ""That man fought for us, for my father and mother,"" 28-year-old Goran Stijela told CNN. One of his companions, Midorag Rodjenkov, called Mladic ""a martyr for Christ."" Mladic was transferred from Lazarevo, about 80 km (50 miles) north of Belgrade, earlier Thursday. In a statement issued after the arrest, the tribunal said it looked forward to his ""expeditious transfer"" to its custody in The Hague, Netherlands, for trial. Once there, he will be allowed to enter a plea to the charges against him, which include genocide, crimes against humanity and violating the laws of war, the court said. ""The arrest of Mladic is a milestone in the Tribunal's history and brings the institution closer to the successful completion of its mandate,"" the tribunal said. The sole remaining fugitive from the court is former Croatian Serb leader Goran Hadzic, ""and the Tribunal hopes he will be arrested in the very near future."" Mladic is accused of leading a campaign of ""ethnic cleansing,"" widespread killing, forcible deportations, torture, forced labor and physical, psychological and sexual violence during the Bosnian war. The international police agency Interpol praised the arrest as ""a triumph for international justice."" Interpol officials had met with Tadic in January to discuss closer cooperation in the hunt for war crimes suspects, the organization's secretary-general, Ronald Noble, said in a statement on Mladic's capture. ""After today's arrest, no one should doubt Serbia's commitment to the rule of law and justice,"" Noble said. Tadic said the arrest will help the process of reconciliation throughout the Balkans and should pave the way for Serbia's entry into the European Union. EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton hailed the arrest as a victory for ""the rule of law in Serbia"" and praised Tadic and his government for ""this courageous action."" Mladic had been on the run since the Bosnian war ended in 1995. The Croatian newspaper Jutarnji List was the first to report his arrest, saying police were doing DNA tests on a suspect to determine whether he was the notorious former commander. Mladic was the last fugitive from a triumvirate of Serbian leaders accused of genocide against Muslims and Croats as the three populations fought a brutal war over Yugoslav territory. Former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was toppled in 2000 and sent to face charges in The Hague, but he died in 2006 while the trial was still going on. Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic was arrested in July 2008 and is now on trial in The Hague. Karadzic was removed from power under the Dayton Peace accords that ended the Bosnian war. He went into hiding, grew a full white beard and long hair, and was working in an alternative medicine clinic in Belgrade -- right under the noses of authorities -- when he was captured. Karadzic has insisted on defending himself at The Hague. Prosecutors accuse him of deliberately obstructing the trial with delaying tactics, and judges have threatened to impose a defense lawyer on him if he does not cooperate. The Bosnian war was the longest of the conflicts spawned by the breakup of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s. Backed by the Milosevic government, Bosnian Serb forces seized control of more than half the country and launched a campaign against the Muslim and Croat populations. The United Nations declared Srebrenica to be a safe haven, and tens of thousands of Bosnian Muslims flooded in, expecting protection. But a small contingent of Dutch U.N. peacekeepers, lightly armed and aware that no reinforcements were coming, stood aside and allowed Mladic's troops to overrun Srebrenica, leading to the slaughter. NATO intervened in the conflict, bombing Bosnian Serb military positions. The United States brought the leaders of the warring factions to an agreement in Dayton, Ohio, in 1995, bringing the violence to an end.

"The number of immigrant deportations on President Barack Obama's watch fell to an all-time low this past year, according to a new border patrol report. As border crossings continue to rise, deportations dropped by about 14 percent in the year that ended Sept. 30 compared to the year before, according to a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement draft report first obtained by the L.A. Times and published Thursday. Nearly 316,000 people were removed from the U.S. A slowdown of deportations might help Obama score higher the Latino community, which overwhelmingly voted for Obama over his GOP challengers, but have been critical of the president's deportation policies, some even calling him a ""Deporter in Chief."" Over the course of his presidency, Obama's administration has deported about 2 million people -- putting him on track to have deported more illegal immigrants than any other President in history. His popularity in the Latino community has inched up since he issued an executive order last month. The action would limit deportations for about 5 million people. While this policy is favored by most Americans, 56% said they opposed Obama's use of executive action. Poll: Obama's immigration policy popular, but approach isn't . House Republicans have approved a measure to challenge Obama's executive order -- and these new deportation numbers could also add fuel to the fire for Congressional Republicans, who say that less deportations will lead to more illegal immigration. ""We essentially tell citizens of other countries, 'If you come here, you can stay -- don't worry, we won't deport you,'"" said Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, in a statement to the L.A. Times. ""The reality on the ground is that unless you commit multiple crimes, the chances of your being removed from this country are close to zero."" Immigration anger fuels House vote . Eighty-five percent of immigrants deported during the year from within the country had a criminal conviction, according to the report. In a statement to CNN, Gillian Christensen, the agency's press secretary, said that I.C.E.'s effort ""prioritizes the removal of convicted criminals and recent border entrants."" That squares with Obama's dedication to focus on ""felons, not families,"" as he said in his executive action speech, honing in on criminal offenses instead of more broad sweeping deportation policies. Christensen noted that numerous factors might contribute to fluctuating year-to-year data, including local court decisions, migration patterns and scheduling air transportation. Most deported immigrants were sent back to their home country: Mexico. Notably, higher than usual numbers of immigrants crossing the border in the past year came from countries other than Mexico, including Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, the report reveals, potentially making the process to obtain travel documents and book flights to distant locations more complicated and more expensive.","President Obama deported immigrants at an all-time low rate during the past year .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Nearly half of all Americans are worried about the collapse of a bridge somewhere in the United States, yet nearly two-thirds reject higher taxes to inspect and fix them, according to a new CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll released Thursday. The collapse of a bridge in Minnesota has put America's infrastructure on the political agenda. In the poll, 52 percent were either ""very worried"" or ""somewhat worried"" about a bridge collapsing. Forty-seven percent were either ""not too worried"" or ""not worried at all."" One percent had no opinion. But only one in three Americans are concerned that a bridge that they drive across regularly will collapse, while 69 percent are not worried. In an effect called BIMBY -- ""Better In My Back Yard"" -- that is common in polling, CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said people often feel that situations locally are better than the national averages. The new numbers come eight days after an interstate highway bridge in Minneapolis, Minnesota, collapsed into the Mississippi River. At least five people were killed in the collapse. Despite the concerns, only one-third of those polled favor increasing the tax on gas to pay for bridge inspections and repairs. The federal program to inspect and repair bridges is funded mostly by the federal tax on gasoline. Sixty-five percent of those questioned were against raising that tax. ""Polls sometimes show that the public is willing to accept higher taxes to pay for popular projects, but not in this case,"" Holland said. ""With the price of gasoline hovering around $3, it may not be surprising that Americans don't want to pay any more at the pump, even though they worry about bridge safety."" Several members of the House Transportation Committee are calling for the tax hike in the wake of the Interstate 35W bridge collapse in Minneapolis last week. Congressman James Oberstar, D-Minnesota, on Wednesday said he would introduce legislation for bridge repair funding and increased inspections. He says a 5-cent increase in the gas tax would pay for the proposed three-year program by generating $8.5 billion a year. Citing 74,000 bridges rated by the federal government as ""structurally deficient,"" Oberstar told reporters ""we cannot wait for another tragedy. We must, and we will, act decisively."" At a news conference Thursday morning at the White House, President Bush dismissed raising the federal gasoline tax, at least until Congress changes the way it spends highway money. ""It's an interesting question, about how Congress spends and prioritizes highway money,"" the president said. ""My suggestion would be that they revisit the process by which they spend gasoline money in the first place."" ""If bridges are a priority, let's make sure we set that priority first and foremost, before we raise taxes,"" Bush said. The poll involved telephone interviews with 1,029 American adults conducted August 6-8, 2007. The poll's margin of error was plus-or-minus 3 percentage points E-mail to a friend .

"When the first Triple E Class cargo vessel sails out of the Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering yard in Okpo, South Korea, on July 2, an intriguing new age of container shipping will commence. Roughly a quarter of a mile long, as tall as a 20-story building and built from enough steel to construct eight Eiffel Towers, the giant vessel will become the largest operating ship on the ocean -- although the first official voyage is not until July 15. Hosting a record-breaking capacity of 18,000 TEU (20-foot equivalent units) containers the Triple E has enough room for 11% more cargo than the world's current largest freight ship, the 16,020 TEU Marco Polo operated by French firm CMA CGM. To put these figures into perspective, 18,000 TEU containers provide enough space to transport 111 million pairs of sneakers. If stacked one atop the other, they would reach a staggering 47 kilometers into the sky. For Maersk, the Danish shipping firm which has 20 of these seafaring behemoths on order at a cost of $190 million each, the Triple E is more than just the next stage in the battle to be the ocean's biggest beast. It's also a vital component of a carefully considered strategy that aims to see the company facilitate long-term trade along the bustling AE10 shipping route between Asia and Europe as well as reduce its carbon footprint. See also: 8 spectacular infrastructure projects . But with the OECD, IMF and European Commission all expecting European GDP to contract in the near term, will such a cargo-capable fleet -- that is already too big for the Panama Canal and most American ports -- still be necessary in the years to come? We asked Maersk COO Morten H. Engelstoft to explain the thinking behind the Triple E and whether its colossal scale could provide a key market edge or end up counting against it. CNN: Why did Maersk decide to build the Triple E? Morten H. Engelstoft (ME): I think there is a clue in the name. The first E stands for economy of scale and this refers to the number of containers we can move in one go. The second E is energy efficiency. We expect the Triple E to reduce fuel consumed by approximately 20% compared to the most fuel-efficient vessel in our fleet today. And the third E is environment. By reducing fuel consumption it will also reduce our CO2 emissions by 20%. CNN: You talk about the environment but Maersk will also save a lot of money on fuel. ME: Absolutely -- fuel is the single largest operational expense we have, somewhere between $5 billion and $6 billion this year. We want to focus on reducing fuel because it is to a large extent within our own control. Our whole behavior is focused on reducing our fuel consumption. If we compare the Triple E with the normal 13,100 (TEU) vessel in the industry in terms of fuel consumption, the Triple E will be 35% more fuel efficient. Therefore, these vessels will help us be more competitive. CNN: How much of a challenge was it to oversee and put together a mammoth ship like this? ME: Clearly it's a big project where we have made a very big technological leap. We have spent a lot of time preparing the vessel, in designing the vessel and building the vessel with the yards. I'd say the most challenging aspect of a project like this is to find out how do you really get to the most optimized ships. See also: Could drones replace highways? If we had decided to make the vessel even bigger then we would have been able to reduce the fuel consumption per unit transported even further, but that would have added complexity. Similarly we have capped the top speed of the vessel at 23 knots. Capping the top speed reduces fuel consumption. We could have decided to cap the top speed at 21 knots. But we decided to have the flexibility that would allow us to go faster if we are late, for whatever reason, in order to catch up with our schedule and reduce the impact of incurring potential extra costs further down the voyage. CNN: Is the Triple E a risk given the current financial uncertainty in Europe? ME: It is clear that the world economy and certainly the economy in Europe is suffering from low growth. Therefore, as the Triple E will operate in the trade area from Asia to Europe, we will watch the market growth very carefully. What we have said is that we want to grow with the market -- we do not want to grow more than the markets. If the slow growth and weak economies continue then we will look to move other capacity from that trade line so that the capacity we deploy will be in line with the growth in the markets. CNN: Is it not a drawback that the Triple E will only be able to dock in a small number of ports initially because of its size? ME: It was always the plan from the outset that these vessels would be deployed in the Asia to Europe trade lane. First of all this is the biggest trade route for us, so it makes sense that we deploy the biggest vessels where we have the most cargo. Also, we have to take into account the terminals and port capabilities. The places that have facilities that can handle vessels of this size are indeed in Asia and in Europe. We have worked with the trade terminals early on to ensure they are ready. I would also expect in time that we will see more terminals being able to handle the vessels. See also: Could Danube be Romania's 'blue motorway?' One interesting thing is that the Triple E is able to carry 2,500 more containers than our current biggest ships, the E class vessels, but is only three meters longer and three meters wider. This means that these vessels do not really require much more capability requirements from the terminal compared to the already existing largest vessels in the world. CNN: Is there a certain prestige with having the world's biggest ship? ME: It's actually not the most important thing for us. We used to have the biggest vessels in the world with the E Class but now currently another company has introduced a bigger vessel. I actually think the way most carriers look at it is how optimized are these vessels. If we had built them even bigger it might not have given us additional cost advantages. For us it is much more important to have vessels that optimize cost efficiency rather than something that is the largest in the world. CNN: Will there be an even bigger ship in the coming years? ME: We are not thinking about it and I actually think an even bigger vessel may become problematic at least in the near future. I think we have reached a point where it will become more difficult. From an infrastructure point of view, the Triple E's can't call at all the ports in the world. A longer vessel will make it more difficult to maneuver in the ports that we are looking at. I'd say there has been a tendency that vessels have been built bigger and more energy efficient as years have gone by but I don't think we will see container vessels becoming any larger for quite a long time.","The Triple E Class container vessel will be the world's biggest operating ship .

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN)  -- It's a nightmarish scenario straight out of the movies: A passenger is forced to land a plane after its pilot becomes incapacitated. Passanger Doug White landed this Super King two-engine turboprop after the pilot fell unconscious. ""Descend and maintain 5,000. Just take your time, we'll set you up for the airport,"" an air traffic controller says. In a calm voice, a passenger responds: ""I need to get my throttle set for this descent. I don't know where to set it at."" The reality was playing aboard a plane over Florida on Sunday in what the National Air Traffic Controllers Association called ""an Easter miracle."" The incident began about 1:30 p.m. The plane, a Super King Air two-engine turboprop with four passengers on board, was headed to Jackson, Mississippi, from Marco Island, Florida, about 18 miles south of Naples. The plane entered the jurisdiction of air traffic control at Miami Center, the facility responsible for high-altitude air traffic in southern Florida and the Caribbean, according to a statement issued by the air traffic controllers association. The pilot notified controllers that the plane was at 9,000 feet and climbing, said Steve Wallace, Miami Center spokesman for the association. However, a controller at the center tried twice to raise the pilot after that and received no response, Wallace said.  Hear audiotape of emergency landing » . After a few moments, a different voice came over the radio: Passenger Doug White told air traffic controllers the pilot was unconscious and they needed help. His wife and two teenage daughters were flying home to Louisiana with him, he said.  Listen to White describe seeing the pilot's eyes roll back in his head » . He reported the plane's autopilot was on and the plane was continuing to climb from 10,000 feet. ""I told my girls to pray hard,"" White later told CNN television affiliate WINK. White later told the Naples Daily News he has a pilot's license and about 130 hours experience flying a single engine Cessna, but had never flown the larger, faster King Air. The difference, experts said, is not as simple as driving a different model of car. A turboprop multi-engine, Wallace told CNN, ""probably lands at a faster speed than he's ever flown a single-engine plane before."" White told air traffic controllers it appeared the pilot had died, according to the statement, and he reported that the plane's autopilot was on and the plane was continuing to climb from 10,000 feet. Two air traffic controllers worked to help him disengage the autopilot, as other controllers stepped in to lighten their workload. ""Keep it coming around when you can ... the turn looks good, very good sir,"" a controller said. The controllers then turned the plane over to air traffic controllers at the airport. One of them had called a friend who was certified in the King Air planes for advice. ""They walked him through flipping the switches, turning the knobs,"" Wallace said. White, who was composed for the most part, seemed doubtful for a brief moment. ""When I touch down ... If I ever touch down, do I just kill the throttle or what?"" he asks. The landing was successful. ""I knew we had to do something ... I knew that much,"" White told WINK. The Federal Aviation Administration has not given any of the involved air traffic controllers permission to speak about the incident, Wallace said. However, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association lauded all of those involved in landing the plane. ""If you were to ask any one of the controllers who worked this even about what happened over the skies of south Florida, they would tell you that it was just a typical day at the office and that it was merely their job,"" association President Patrick Forrey said in the statement. ""However, the actions they all took to save the passengers aboard the flight were beyond heroic."" Victoria Moreland, spokeswoman for Southwest Florida International Airport, said the pilot's death was confirmed after the plane landed. The cause of death was unclear, Moreland said. It's rare for a pilot to suffer a medical emergency during flight, said Chris Dancy, spokesman for the Frederick, Maryland-based Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association. The organization issues a yearly summary of accident trends and factors based on National Transportation Safety Board reports involving aircraft of less than 12,500 pounds -- smaller than the King Air involved in Sunday's incident. According to the most recent report, which covers the year 2007, out of 22 million general aviation flight hours, an estimated 15 million to 20 million flights, only six instances of a pilot's medical incapacitation were reported, he said. In four of those instances, the pilot died. CNN's Ashley Broughton contributed to this report.","Passenger Doug White commandeers plane after pilot loses consciousness .

"(CNN) -- Investigators in Bosnia have uncovered a mass grave thought to contain several hundred bodies of victims of the conflict that followed the breakup of the former Yugoslavia two decades ago. The remains are believed to be those of victims of Bosniak and Croat ethnicity from Prijedor and its surroundings, killed in the summer of 1992, according to the Prosecutor's Office of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The site, at Tomasica in Prijedor municipality, is one of the biggest mass graves found in Bosnia and Herzegovina since the conflict, said Boris Grubesic, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office. As of Thursday, 231 complete bodies had been exhumed, as well as the body parts of another 112 people. But, he added, the number found goes up by the day or even the hour. More than 30 personal items have also been found, he said. Excavation of the mass grave, which goes to a depth of 10 meters (33 feet), began in early September and is expected to continue into next week. The remains are being taken to an identification center in Sanski Most, where they will remain until the forensic analysis and identification process is completed, the prosecutor's office said. Representatives of the International Commission on Missing Persons, the interior ministry for Bosnia and Herzegovina and the prosecutor's office are present for the dig, as well as an expert forensic pathologist. Missing relatives . Identification of the remains may help bring closure for the many families whose relatives vanished in the course of the conflict, which ended in 1995. About 9,000 people are still missing, about 30% of all those reported after the conflict. Another 22,000 have been accounted for, according to the International Commission on Missing Persons. Ambassador Peter Sorensen, head of the delegation of the European Union to Bosnia and Herzegovina, was part of a delegation that visited the Tomasica site just over a month ago, when he spoke of the thousands still missing. ""Their families have the right to know what happened to their missing relatives,"" he said. ""Governments, military authorities and former armed groups have an obligation to provide all the relevant information they hold, and assist in efforts to put families back together."" He and others also visited another grave site under excavation, this one at a garbage disposal site in Sarajevo. Witness statements suggest that as many as 100 bodies may be found there, but two decades worth of garbage must first be removed, according to a statement from the International Commission on Missing Persons. Kathryne Bomberger, director general of the commission, praised the work of the investigators, saying that the excavation works at the two sites were ""some of the most complex undertaken in the region."" ""The process of investigating these disappearances is a painstaking one which requires careful excavation of clandestine gravesites and precise documentation of evidence that is recovered,"" she said. War crimes trials . The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, a U.N.-backed court, continues to prosecute war crimes committed during the conflicts in the Balkans in the 1990s. Four cases remain at trial, including that of former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, accused of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. The other three on trial are former Bosnian Serb army leader Ratko Mladic, who's indicted for genocide and other war crimes; Croatian Serb rebel leader Goran Hadzic, accused of crimes against humanity and war crimes; and Vojislav Seselj, a Serb nationalist politician who faces charges of crimes against humanity and war crimes. The tribunal said ""the most significant number"" of its cases dealt with alleged crimes by Serbians or Bosnian Serbs. But there have been convictions for crimes against Serbs by others, including Croats, Bosnian Muslims and Kosovo Albanians. Serbia's president declines to define killing of 8,000 in Srebrenica as 'genocide' CNN's Talia Kayali contributed to this report.","The bodies are thought to be those of victims of Bosniak and Croat ethnicity killed in 1992 .

"Why my brother? Jordan Somers indirectly puts the question to al Qaeda militants in Yemen in a video message, in which he and his mother plead with them to let American Luke Somers go. The Islamists have threatened to kill the photojournalist who fell into their hands in September last year, if Washington doesn't meet their demands. ""We have no explanation as to why Luke was targeted as a victim, and we currently don't know why he is being held,"" Jordan Somers tells them. He wants his captors to believe that his brother is a good man who cares about Yemenis. ""He has made many lasting friends in Yemen,"" he says. Special forces raid . A raid by U.S. and Yemeni special forces last month that freed eight hostages could have also rescued Luke Somers, but a move by his captors prevented it. Then this week, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, released the video threatening his life and showing Somers pleading for it. Nasser bin Ali al-Ansi, who read a statement for al Qaeda in the video, did not name the demands the terrorist group expects the U.S. government to meet, but said that Washington knows what they are. Special forces planned the raid after al Qaeda militants were spotted transferring the hostages into pickups, ""chained and covered in blankets,"" according to a website associated with Yemen's defense ministry. Militants drove them to a cave over 65 miles away from the town of Hajir al-Saiyer. U.S. and Yemeni special forces outfitted with night visors embarked on the mission about four miles from the cave. They encountered the kidnappers near its entrance; a gun battle ensued, and the special forces killed all seven abductors. They also freed eight chained up hostages, who told them that militants had moved five more hostages to another location, according to the Yemeni defense ministry account. That included Somers. 'We mean no harm' His brother Jordan asks the AQAP militants not to fault Somers or his family. ""He is not responsible for any actions that the U.S. government has taken. Please understand that we had no prior knowledge of the rescue attempt for Luke, and we mean no harm to anyone,"" Jordan Somers said. The Yemeni account did not mention the U.S. Special Forces, but a U.S. official confirmed their participation. CNN, at the request of the government, delayed reporting the information about the raid, so as not to endanger the search for Somers and the other hostages at that time. Somers appeared in the AQAP video asking for help and identifying himself. ""My name is Luke Somers. I'm 33 years old. I was born in England, but I carry American citizenship and have lived in America for most of my life,"" he said. Mother's plea . He was dressed in a nice shirt and at least appeared clean and healthy. This did not escape his mother. ""We note that you have taken good care of Luke, and he appears healthy. We thank you for that,"" Paula Somers says in the family's response video to AQAP. ""Please show mercy and give us an opportunity to see our Luke again. He is all that we have,"" she says. She tells her son that the family is doing all it can to help him. They want to hold him safe in their arms again.

"(CNN) -- He's been called the Bill Gates of India, the man who has made India synonymous with IT and outsourcing, and is consistently cited as one of the world's best technology and business brains. You've either got IT or you haven't: Nandan Nilekani and Infosys is one of India's biggest success stories. As the co-founder and co-chairman of Infosys Technology, Nandan Nilekani has received plenty of accolades for being at the forefront of India's transformation into a global leader in information technology. He was Forbes Asia Businessman of the Year in 2006, the same year he was given one of India' highest civilian honors, the Padma Bhushan. From modest beginnings, getting into the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology to study engineering was a defining moment in Nilekani's life. ""I was just a middle class kid from a small town, and meeting a lot of very bright people gave me a lot of confidence and figure out how the world works,"" he told CNN. While he has said that he lacked ambition as a young man -- ""it came later in life"" -- he had enough foresight and initiative to set up Infosys in 1981 with six others, and so the fabled company story goes, with only $250 of capital. Infosys is now worth an estimated $4 billion and his ambition to develop Infosys as a company of ethics and excellence is as strong as ever. As a businessman, Nilekani is sought after for his business nous and ability to develop a company, but he is just as in demand as an excellent communicator and technology visionary. He's courted by governments and focus groups and sits on the directors' board of a number of international organizations. ""A good leader is one who can connect a bird's-eye view with a worm's-eye view of the world. Nandan is very good with the bird's-eye-view,"" said Infosys' Chairman of the Board Narayana Murthy. Nilekani told CNN: ""I had the patience to listen to those points of view and then hammer out a resolution or a solution that was acceptable to everybody. I realized I could be a consensus builder, a lot of that comes from my background."" He's been realistic about the current global economic crisis, predicting an inevitable slowdown in the growth of India's IT sector but stated at the India Economic Summit in New Delhi in November that they will continue to grow, despite the difficulties ahead. The days of scorching growth might be over, but with a worm's-eye view and a bird's-eye view of the global situation, Nilekani is one Indian industrialist who has the vision to see through tough times.","Set up Infosys with six others in 1981 with $250 capital; now worth $4 billion .

"(CNN) -- Even for an employed schoolteacher like Narinder, it is hard to find a bride these days. Narinder is a shy, slender 36-year old with a certain anxiety about him -- as if he has resigned to a fate that he is unable to change. He is very polite and at first, reluctant to talk about his situation. Narinder is one of four sons and only one of his brothers has managed to get married. In his district in the state of Uttar Pradesh, there are only 858 girls born for every 1,000 boys, a ratio that doesn't occur naturally without medical intervention. The northwestern state of Uttar Pradesh is home to one of the largest skewed sex ratios in India. INFOGRAPHIC: India's gender gap . ""Only the rich and men with government jobs manage to get a bride these days,"" he says. ""Anyone who earns less cannot find a bride here anymore."" In India's conservative society, remaining a bachelor is not an option. A new bride would help his parents, he says. ""They would have had an easier life. They would have had someone to cook and to take care of them."" She should clean. She should run the household. She should bear children. And Narinder plans to share her with his two unmarried brothers, who live in the same house. But he cannot find a bride in his village, where so few exist. So, he contacted an agent to find one from another state. Narinder may be a victim of the heavily-skewed male sex ratio in his community; more broadly, the desire to buy a bride is also fueling bride trafficking. Decades of sex-selective abortion have created an acute lack of women in certain parts of India. Traffickers capitalize on the shortage by recruiting or kidnapping women ensnared in poverty to sell as brides. It's a cycle influenced by poverty and medical technologies, but one that ultimately is perpetuated by India's attitude towards women. India grapples with rape and sexual violence . Where India's trafficked brides come from . Across the country, in the northeastern state of Assam, the sobs of a couple fill a hut made of mud and bamboo. An aging couple cannot hold back their tears when they look at a passport-sized image of a dark-haired teenager, whose expression is washed out by water spots. This faded photo is all what's left of Jaida, their 16-year-old daughter. Jaida's family ended up in the village of mud houses at a safe distance from the Brahmaputra River, after floods had destroyed their livelihood. The family retains a few of their possessions: pots, pans, a few goats and two Indian daybeds. They had no access to farmland and Jaida's father earned a living by weaving baskets and mats out of straw. Jaida disappeared more than two years ago from their makeshift settlement along the Brahmaputra River. She was last seen talking to a stranger on a rainy day. Her parents' hopes rest with Shafiq Khan, a human rights activist, who has come to find out why more than 3,000 women went missing in the state of Assam in 2012. The National Crime Records Bureau estimated in 2012 that about 10 women are kidnapped in Assam every day. Some of these women are found again. Some go missing forever. Eastern Indian states like Assam, Jharkhand, West Bengal and Odisha turn into source areas for bride trafficking, because they have much more balanced sex ratios. Meanwhile, India's northwestern states are more conservative and also more affluent, meaning they're able to afford ultrasound scans and selective abortions. Halida, a 14-year-old girl, lives in a neighboring village, near Jaida's family. In December 2012, as a violent gang rape in Delhi shocked the world, Halida was fetching water when she was kidnapped by a man on a motorbike. He took Halida to a house, locked her up and raped her over two days. Only when the man said that he would sell her in Delhi, did Halida muster the courage to escape. Opinion: India can learn respect for women . While Halida managed to escape her captor, she could not escape the blame her community cast on her. When her village found out about the attack, children started to tease her, making school a nightmare. Nobody would hire her father, a day-laborer, so he has to venture ever further afield in search of work. During the interview, Halida's mother sat quietly in a corner, but didn't hide her opinions: That her daughter had brought shame on the whole family. Shafiq Khan, the human rights advocate, says there is a cruel logic to this: Rape is a means for the trafficker to exert power over their victims. And the social stigma attached to rape puts the victim in an even more vulnerable situation. India's northeastern states have all the ingredients for turning poor women into traffickers' prey. The question is why? Opinion: Where have India's females gone? When everyone wants a son . India's preference for sons transcends all religions and castes. ""As fertility declines, people choose not only the number of children they have, but also choose the sex of the child,"" says Poonam Muttreja, a prominent campaigner for women's rights and an adviser to the government. ""And everyone wants a son."" The skewed sex ratio is due to what Puneet Bedi, a Delhi suburb gynecologist, calls ""mass murder on an unprecedented scale."" Census data shows some districts in India have fewer than 800 girls born for every 1,000 boys, leaving male-heavy villages. A maverick amongst India's medical community, Bedi accuses his colleagues of helping parents use ultrasound scans to determine the sex of the baby and abort females, because of a cultural preference for sons. If this practice doesn't stop, Bedi fears the worst for the future of India. ""The social fabric of society we accept as normal is unimaginable when a good 20 or 30% of the women are missing,"" he says. Opinion: How terrible is it to be born a girl? Why such a strong preference for sons exists is a matter of heated debate. Some point out that it is expensive to marry off daughters, because of the practice of dowry. Although dowry is outlawed in India, this practice persists. Others maintain that daughters only look after their in-laws, instead of their birth parents, when they grow old. Muttreja calls this pure myth. Women have been shown to be much more reliable when it comes to looking after relatives or using their earnings responsibly, she says. ""While working women send money back to their families, men hold back money for liquor, cigarettes and perhaps going to sex workers, too,"" she says. The middle-class especially selects for sons, suggesting that economic development isn't likely to solve the problem, according to recent census data. When brides are sold . Although women are outnumbered by men in northwestern states, trafficked brides do not arrive into their new homes as prized wives. They have a name for the purchased brides -- paro -- which is derogatory for foreigner or stranger. We met 32 of them in a village of less than 1,000 people in the northeastern state of Haryana. Tasleema and her sister Akhleema are originally from Kolkata. Their family was so poor, they decided to sell them to a trafficker. The sisters are married to two brothers in a dusty village in Haryana. During their childhood in Kolkata, they recalled, on a few lucky days, there was money to go to the cinema. After being sold as brides, their lives are spent cooking, cleaning and working in the fields. They tell us of beatings and abuse. ""Even the village children talk to us like dogs,"" the sisters say. Faced with the allegations, the husbands maintain they paid more than $2,000 to traffickers, before they married the sisters. They emphasize that the men are stigmatized too, because they didn't manage to find a bride locally and instead had to buy one of the ""paro"" women. ""Patriarchy is so entrenched in our society. Girls are unwelcome visitor(s) in our own homes, and that's how they are treated,"" says Muttreja, the activist. The men and women alike speak of their situation with surprising frankness. The public outrage after the Delhi rape case has shown India's ability for self-criticism and the willingness of a significant part of its society to leave behind a deeply entrenched patriarchy. But this vicious cycle of aborting girls, kidnapping women and selling off brides continues -- the byproduct of a culture that sees sons as a blessing and daughters as a curse.","Employed schoolteacher seeks to purchase bride and with the intention of sharing her with unmarried brothers .

"An Idaho man who fired an assault rifle at the White House and struck the residential wing in 2011 pleaded guilty on Wednesday to terrorism and weapons charges. Oscar Ramiro Ortega-Hernandez, 22, of Idaho Falls, drove 2,000 miles to Washington to carry out the attack, the Justice Department said. On Nov. 11, 2011, shortly before 9 p.m. ET, he stopped his car in the middle of Constitution Avenue and fired at least eight shots from a Romanian Cugir semi-automatic, an AK-47 style rifle, through the open passenger window. He sped off but crashed nearby, managing to get away on foot and ultimately hopping aboard an empty car of a freight train. He was arrested in Indiana, Pennsylvania, five days later. No one was hurt in the incident. Read the complaint against Ramiro Ortega-Hernandez . Ortega-Hernandez faces a minimum of 10 years in prison, and a possible maximum of just over 27 years under sentencing guidelines. He admitted that the attack was an act of terrorism. ""Firing an assault rifle at the White House to make a political statement is terrorism, plain and simple,"" U.S. Attorney Ron Machen said in a statement that also made reference to this week's Washington Navy Yard shooting. ""As we have seen this week, gunmen who come to the nation's capital bent on violence can inflict terrible damage,"" Machen said. According to the FBI, Ortega-Hernandez's friends reported that he made anti-government statements beginning in 2010. He believed that the federal government was trying to control Americans through GPS, fluoride and aspartame. He was also angry at what he believed was U.S. bullying of other countries, including in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and claimed that the president was the ""anti-Christ"" and told friends he was ""on a mission from God to take out Obama."" He bought the assault rifle from a private seller the previous March for $550, and later bought more than 1,200 rounds of ammunition and a scope, federal authorities said. He practiced shooting on federal land near Idaho Falls. According to the FBI, Ortega-Hernandez made two short videos on October 23, 2011, praising Osama bin Laden for having the courage to stand up to the United States, and called for a revolution against the federal government. In the videos, Ortega-Hernandez described himself as a ""cold-hearted warrior of God"" and declared, ""it's time for Armageddon."" After the shooting, FBI and Secret Service agents found eight locations where the bullets struck the White House, including a window sill of the Truman balcony on the south side of the mansion.","Idaho man fired assault weapon at the White House in 2011, striking the residence; no one hurt .

"It's late in Iran on a dark night, moonless or with heavy clouds. Suddenly the silence is broken by sonic booms, followed by the sound of jets roaring overhead. Flying in tight formation, Israeli fighter planes drop bunker-busting bombs on a nuclear enrichment plant built into the side of a mountain. Iranian pilots race for their own jets to fight back, but by the time they take to the sky, it's too late. The Israeli jets streak away. That, at least, is what Israel would like to happen if it decides to attack Iran in an effort to prevent it from acquiring the ability to make nuclear weapons. But would it be as easy for Israel to destroy Iran's nuclear sites as it was for the Jewish state to strike an Iraqi reactor in 1981 or a suspected one in Syria five years ago? Experts inside and outside Israel say no. They envision a much more complicated attack, one that would involve more than 100 planes -- from fighters to refueling tankers -- flying hundreds of miles to bomb up to eight targets around Iran. Possible site of Iran explosive tests identified, think tank says . Israel hit one target each in Iraq and Syria, but Iran's nuclear assets are spread over multiple sites in different parts of the country. One is buried under concrete. Another is dug into a mountain. Surface-to-air missiles and electronic warfare systems protect them all. They also are significantly farther away from Israel than the targets in Iraq or Syria. And they may not be the only sites Israel would need to destroy to achieve its goal. Bombing Iranian nuclear facilities would be ""very complicated,"" said Ephraim Kam, deputy director of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies. ""It is a very large-scale operation, much greater than the one carried out in Iraq 30 years ago,"" said Kam, a former colonel who served with an intelligence research division in the Israeli military. Israel would most likely attack Iran with fighters jets -- the F-15I and the F-16I -- rather than missiles fired from submarines, Kam and other experts said. ""In order to create proper damage to the nuclear plants, you need extremely accurate weapons,"" Kam said. ""I don't know that the missiles are accurate enough."" According to the London-based defense analysis group Jane's, Israel has one squadron -- about 25 planes -- of F-15I jets, which are similar to the F-15 Eagle fighters of the U.S. Air Force. Israel calls its version of the fighter Raam, or Thunder. It has four squadrons of F-16Is, the Israeli version of the U.S. F-16 Fighting Falcon. The Israeli jet is known as the Suefa, or Storm. The Israeli fighters lack the range to reach most of the likely targets in Iran, so Israel would also need to put tanker aircraft into the sky, said Douglas Barrie of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. Israel has at least seven KC-707 tankers that it could use for airborne refueling, Barrie said. It also has at least four KC-130H tankers, versions of the giant Hercules aircraft, but is not likely to use them because their slow speed means the jets would need to slow down to link with them, wasting fuel, he said. The strike aircraft would carry bunker-busting GBU-28 bombs -- 5,000-pound bombs to ""go after hardened and buried sites,"" Barrie said. Each F-15I could carry up to three bunker-busters, he said, depending on whether they are configured to carry the maximum number of bombs or the largest possible amount of fuel. The American military has an even larger bunker-buster, the 30,000-pound GBU-57, but there's ""no indication the Israelis have requested that weapon"" or that Israel has the B-2 or B-52 bombers needed to deliver it, Barrie said. Like other experts, he based his analysis on the assumption that if Israel mounted an attack, it would do so without American help. There would be at least four primary targets, said Emily Chorley, a nuclear expert at Jane's: the Natanz and Fordo nuclear enrichment plants, the Esfahan uranium conversion facility, and the Arak nuclear complex. Esfahan and Arak are above ground and are ""relatively vulnerable to aerial attack,"" she said. But Natanz, in the center of the country, is buried under 33 feet of earth and 6 feet of concrete, Chorley said, making it ""very hard to penetrate."" Fordo, near the holy city of Qom, is ""even more difficult"" because it is deeply buried in a mountain, she said. Dropping a bunker-busting bomb on Fordo actually might make it less vulnerable, Chorley said, since collapsing the entrance without destroying the facility would protect it from further bombing. ""It's questionable whether Israel is capable of destroying it in an air-launched attack,"" she said. ""Just getting Natanz and Arak without getting Fordo wouldn't be worth the risk,"" she argued, since Fordo is enriching uranium to higher levels than the other sites. All four targets are protected by S-200 and Hawk surface-to-air missile batteries, said Chorley's colleague, Jim O'Halloran, a specialist in land-based air defense. Israel would have at least two secondary targets as well, Chorley predicted -- the Tabriz and Imam Ali missile bases in the west, ""to prevent a retaliatory missile attack"" on Israel. It also could try to strike the controversial Parchin military base east of Tehran, which inspectors with the International Atomic Energy Agency have been trying to visit, Chorley said. Israel also might target the Bidganeh military base, which suffered a mysterious explosion in November. That would bring the number of potential targets to eight. Iran's single declared civilian nuclear reactor probably is safe, Chorley said. An attack on the Bushehr reactor would risk spreading nuclear contamination, and could mean killing Russian personnel at the Russian-built facility, infuriating Moscow. Israel has three potential routes of attack, according to Jane's and other experts, assuming its fighters do not fly all the way around the Arabian Peninsula. Jane's says the Israeli Air Force does not have enough refueling capacity to travel that distance. The northern route would go through Turkey, with which Israel has tense relations. The southern route would go through Saudi Arabia, which fears its rival Iran getting a bomb but is openly hostile toward Israel. The central route is the shortest. It runs through Jordan and Iraq. Jordan and Israel are at peace, but there's no guarantee Jordan would formally give Israel permission to fly over its territory. Iraqi air defenses, meanwhile, ""cannot prevent violations of sovereignty,"" said Charles Hollosi of IHS Jane's. That makes it the ""most likely location for air refueling."" Israel will need to decide what altitude its planes would fly at on the way in. Flying higher would protect them from the defenses of the countries they fly over, but will expose them sooner to Iranian radar. ""You're going to be in the cockpit three hours-plus before you get to the target unless you go the central route,"" said Barrie, the International Institute for Strategic Studies' senior fellow for military aerospace in London. He doubts the Iranians would be able to detect them coming that far away. ""I don't imagine them having two hours' notice. The Israelis will be desperate to give them as little notice as possible. ""They will try to ensure their aircraft remain below their radar as long as possible,"" he said. ""If you're in an Israeli fast jet you don't want it to be anything like a fair fight."" Barrie noted the Israeli military's success in attacking a suspected nuclear site in Syria in 2007. ""The Israelis, with a mix of electronic warfare and electronic attack, degraded Syrian air defenses to the point where they didn't see the strike package coming in,"" he said. ""Can the Israelis pull off tactical surprise the way they did with the Syrians in 2007? Going after three or four strike targets is much harder,"" he said. Iran's air force has American-made F-14 Tomcats acquired under the shah's regime, which ended in 1979, Barrie said, as well as Russian-made MiG-29s. On paper, they are not a match for the Israeli planes. ""Israel remains the pre-eminent air force in the region -- well-equipped, and they have trained long and hard,"" he said. ""The Iranians are at an obvious disadvantage in terms of the age and quality of the equipment they have, but they also train hard and will be motivated,"" Barrie said. ""I would be surprised if the Israelis are underestimating the Iranians.""","An Israeli attack on Iran would involve more than 100 planes, experts say .
They would need to hit as many as eight well-protected Iranian targets .
Experts: Israel's air force is superior on paper, but the Iranians train hard .

"Atlanta is shut down -- businesses, roads, government in general -- and while that's generated furor among residents, the angst is exacerbated by the overnight uncertainty involving many of the city's cubs. Across the state, and even extending into Alabama, there were reports of children spending the night in schools, their parents or school buses unable to navigate treacherous conditions that Georgia Department of Public Safety Commissioner Col. Mark McDonough said caused almost 1,000 accidents in the Georgia capital alone. Fifty Atlanta students remained on school buses overnight, and seven of them still weren't home by 5 a.m. ET Wednesday, Atlanta Public Schools spokeswoman Kimberly Willis Green said. Atlanta police delivered food to the kids, who were all home or returned to schools by 9 a.m. ET, she said. Finally, word came from Green on Wednesday evening that every child that had been stuck was on a bus and headed home. That included the 2,000 Fulton County Schools students and 400 Atlanta Public Schools kids who had stayed at their schools overnight. Facing critics who ask how fewer than 3 inches of snow could cripple the city, especially after it tangled with another debilitating storm in 2011, Mayor Kasim Reed assured Atlantans the city was working to open roads and asked them to stay at home. ""What I want to say to them is hold off on trying to get to them. What I can assure (you) is they are safe,"" he said. ""The safest place for them was in the school system. ... I know it is very tough."" There were uplifting stories amid the chaos, however, as the city schools' Twitter feed and a specially created Facebook page, SnowedOutAtlanta, which had more than 52,000 members as of Wednesday night, showed a steady stream of gratitude alongside the messages of frustration. At E. Rivers Elementary School, about 150 students and teachers spent the night on gym mats, according to CNN affiliate WSB. They watched movies, ate a warm meal Tuesday night and were served French toast for breakfast, the station reported. Was Atlanta asleep at the wheel? One father, who identified himself only as Mark, said he walked 6 miles to spend the night with his 5-year-old daughter, Elizabeth. He said it put his mind at ease to see how the school staff was taking care of the youngsters. ""It was fantastic. All the students seemed like they were having a great time,"" he told WSB. ""It looked like a very large sleepover party."" Added young Elizabeth, ""We got to watch four or five movies."" Heartwarming stories were heavily outnumbered by those from worried parents who had to spend the night without their children. Corliss Collins, for instance, said she spoke to her granddaughter, one of about 200 students who spent the night at New Manchester High School in Douglasville, west of Atlanta, around 8 a.m. The granddaughter ate dinner and breakfast there, but told her grandmother that school officials were asking parents to pick up their children because the cafeteria had run out of food, Collins said. Principal Constance Craft told CNN there was no truth to reports the school had no food. ""We are trying to get teachers who have been here since early morning yesterday home to their families. Our manpower is exhausted, and our children are ready to be home,"" she said in an e-mail. Craft later added that the National Guard troops who helped escort the students home were ""wonderful."" All students had been sent home by lunchtime Wednesday, she said. In West Atlanta, about 60 students from Riverwood International Charter School remained at a Kroger supermarket Wednesday morning after being transported there from their buses, which were stuck on I-285, said store employee Kim Bradley. The store provided food for them, she said. About 90 high school students were initially taken there overnight in ambulances, with Highway Emergency Road Operators clearing a path, the state Department of Transportation said. The four buses were evacuated about 6 a.m. after being stuck in ice and traffic all night, the department said. A total of 51 schoolbuses ""needed support"" because of the snow and ice, said Matthew Kallmyer, director of Atlanta-Fulton County Emergency Management Agency. Other reports from Georgia and Alabama include: . -- Eight students from Marietta City Schools, northwest of Atlanta, spent the night in the school bus depot, and 669 students spent the night at eight schools in the system, said spokesman Thomas Algarin. The system was working to get them all home, he said Wednesday morning. ""Our schools were prepared for this,"" Algarin said, adding that Marietta High School's culinary team a ""terrific gourmet meal last night."" -- Schools in Cherokee County, Georgia, north of Atlanta, reported 150 students remained at 11 schools as of Wednesday morning. The number had dwindled to 10 as of 12:15 p.m. ET. ""Students are being kept safe, warm and fed, and staff are doing their best to keep them entertained with movies, games, books and other activities,"" spokeswoman Barbara Jacoby said in a statement. -- In Georgia's Paulding and Douglas counties, west of Atlanta, schools reported about 1,800 collective students were sheltered at county schools, CNN affiliate WXIA reported. In Douglas County, the schools offered shelter to people had gotten stuck on the roads or walked to the schools, the station reported. -- In Hoover, Alabama, one bus with 61 children was stuck until 6 a.m. ET, but the kids were safe, said spokesman Jason Gaston, and another stranded bus had its 21 occupants moved to a local children's hospital. About 4,000 students and 350 adults -- including some community members who couldn't make it home -- were sheltered in Hoover schools Wednesday morning, Gaston said, adding that the cafeteria was well stocked and the schools were prepared to host those in need until the roads cleared. Students were watching movies and playing video games, he said. iReporter Monica Cantwell said she spent the night in her office at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and her 13-year-old daughter was stuck at her middle school in Hoover. The school separated the kids by gender and put them into small groups at bedtime. The kids were playing games and watching videos in the gym and watching videos, she said, and her daughter had texted her to say was bored and none too thrilled to be spending the night on campus. -- As of 8 a.m., at least 1,400 students spent the night in Birmingham, Alabama-area schools, and none spent the night on buses because they were either shuttled back to school or picked up by parents, said Jefferson County Emergency Management officer Bob Ammons. Steve Smith, associate superintendent of Atlanta Public Schools, told CNN that roughly 1 million people attempted to go home Tuesday, gnarling traffic on Atlanta's roads and highways. ""The storm was much more intense than anyone knew, and even with our efforts of early dismissal, we still ran into the challenge of having the gridlock,"" he said. Smith declined to say when the students would be home but said they'd be reunited with their parents as soon as conditions allowed it. Could the city have handled the situation better? Sure, he said. ""There's always room for improvement, but we're just appreciative of our parents who have been understanding and patient with us, and our bus drivers have really been the heroes in this situation. They've made some real sacrifices,"" he said. ""Our staff with students as well have made sacrifices. So  our principals and staff, they've worked with us and have been very cooperative."" Birmingham Mayor William Bell, too, said his city was expecting a ""light dusting,"" and by the time they realized the severity of the wintry weather, ""it was too late."" ""All of the businesses and schools began to let out. It clogged up our interstate system, which then led to a clogging of the side roads and many people became stranded,"" he said. ""We have had to scurry to try to play catch up and all of our people working in the public works department, our public safety units within the fire and the police department, they've all been out overnight to try to deal with the stranded motorists.""

"(CNN)He runs his terror group like a CEO -- with spreadsheets on missions, assassinations and captured assets. And reports from Iraq's government suggest ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi may have been hit in airstrikes over the weekend -- though it's not clear whether he was wounded, whose strikes he may have been hit by and in what part of the country he may have been struck. But if al-Baghdadi is dead, what would happen to the radical Sunni militant group? Don't expect ISIS to just crumble. ""It will morph, and new leaders will emerge,"" retired U.S. Maj. Gen. James ""Spider"" Marks said. ""In fact, bear in mind that ISIS leadership originated from Saddam's military. These are very conventionally trained, very professional leaders."" Odds are al-Baghdadi or the Shura Council, which handles the group's religious and military affairs, has planned this scenario in advance. ""ISIS likely has a clear line of succession,"" said Lauren Squires of the Institute for the Study of War. ""This is a bureaucratic organization with a deep bench ... either Baghdadi has signed off on the line of succession himself or the Shura Council has agreed to a line of succession."" Top two deputies . Al-Baghdadi has a Cabinet of advisers as well as two top deputies -- Abu Muslim al-Turkmani, who oversees ISIS' mission in Iraq, and Abu Ali al-Anbari, who is in charge of operations in Syria, according to the Terrorism Research and Analysis Consortium. Both men are veteran Iraqi military officials who served under Saddam Hussein. ""These people who had previously served in Saddam Hussein's army were extremely brutal because Saddam Hussein's regime was very brutal,"" said Peter Neumann of King's College. ""But they also inherited the disciplines and the military skills that are now benefiting ISIS in its campaign against its enemies."" Analysts say al-Turkmani could make a strong case to become the leader of ISIS if al-Baghdadi is taken out. ""He would also have had to have a lot of outstanding qualities either in the political or the military field, and that certainly makes him a potential contender,"" Neumann said. Beneath each deputy are 12 governors for both Iraq and Syria. Those governors handle financial, military, legal, media and intelligence councils, among others. What's interesting about the bureaucratic hierarchy of ISIS is that it looks a lot like those of some Western countries whose values it rejects -- except there's no democracy involved and there's a council tasked with considering who to behead. Another possibility . Then there's Syrian Abu Mohammed al-Adnani, the chief spokesman for ISIS who could also take over the group. In September, al-Adnani called for ISIS supporters to launch lone-wolf attacks. Analysts say some of al-Baghdadi's top deputies were imprisoned with the spokesman at Camp Bucca, a U.S.-run detention center in Iraq where al-Baghdadi was also held for at least four years. ""He was able to trust these individuals as sharing his ideology, sharing his hatred for the West.,"" Squires said. The Shura Council's importance . If al-Baghdadi is still alive, there's one group of people who can take him out even without the use of airstrikes or violence. The Shura Council is the religious monitor for ISIS. Not only does it make sure all the local councils and governors are sticking to ISIS' version of Islamic law, it has the ability to stand up to al-Baghdadi. ""The Shura Council has the right to tell Baghdadi to go if he's not adhering to ISIS' religious standards,"" said Jasmine Opperman of the Terrorism Research and Analysis Consortium. ""It would most probably never happen, but the fact that it's possible indicates the council's prominence."" She said the recent beheadings of Western hostages James Foley, Steven Sotloff, and David Haines would have fallen under the Shura council's purview. On top of that, Opperman said, the Shura Council also has the power to censure the leadership for running afoul of its interpretation of Sharia law. But what happens if al-Baghdadi dies might just be hypothetical for now. While some Iraqi officials say the ISIS leader was wounded in an airstrike, U.S. officials say they can't confirm whether al-Baghdadi was hit at all. CNN's Dugald McConnell, Nick Thompson, Atika Shubert and Barbara Starr contributed to this report.","ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi may have been wounded in an airstrike .

"(CNN) -- On Thursday night Shonda Rhimes will rule the airwaves. The creative powerhouse will have not one, not two, but three shows premiering on ABC. ""Grey's Anatomy"" and ""Scandal"" will be joined by a newcomer, ""How to Get Away With Murder,"" starring Viola Davis. And while it's not the first time Rhimes has had three shows on the network -- her show ""Private Practice"" went off the air last year -- having a block of prime-time shows on a single night is quite the accomplishment. It's an even bigger deal for an African-American woman. The Los Angeles Times wrote that viewers might just want to go ahead and dub Thursdays ""Shondaday."" Shonda Rhimes strikes back against 'angry black woman' label . For her part, Rhimes is just focused on the product. ""I know it's an incredible amount of trust that's being placed on me, I get that. ... But I'm not really thinking about, 'Oh, I'm the Thursday queen,' "" Rhimes told the Times. ""Uh, no. I'm thinking, ' ""Grey's"" has to be good, ""Scandal"" has to be good, and ""Murder"" has to be damn good.' "" Rhimes has become known as a bit of a tour de force in Hollywood. A writer and a producer, she became the first black woman in Hollywood to create and producer a top 10 series with ""Grey's Anatomy."" Since then, she has leveraged her equity in the industry to not only create hits, but also pave the way for others. And her experience hasn't been limited to the small screen. She also wrote the screenplays for ""The Princess Diaries 2"" and the Britney Spears film ""Crossroads."" But television is where she has found her greatest success. To get you ready for the monumental Thursday night event, here are just a few of the sign posts you will find as you make your way through Shondaland: . 1. Strong female leads . Move over, Olivia Pope. Annalise Keating has it handled. Academy Award-nominated actress Viola Davis takes no prisoners as Keating, a tough-as-nails attorney who employs some of her top students to help get her clients off. She joins characters like ""Scandal's"" Pope (played by Kerry Washington) and ""Grey's Anatomy's"" Meredith Grey (played by Ellen Pompeo) in Rhimes' portofolio of female characters who play hardball. ""The question I'm asked most often as a defense attorney is whether I can tell if my clients are innocent or guilty,"" Davis says as Keating in a promo for the show. ""I don't care."" 2. Some vino . No ""Scandal"" viewing party is complete without some red wine and popcorn, a favorite dinner meal of the main character, Pope. It's so serious that you can even buy the style of wine glasses that Olivia swigs from. And let us not forget how often some of the ""Grey's"" characters have come together in a bar. Booze definitely has a place in Rhimes' shows. 3. LGBT characters . Rhimes has been a pioneer in terms of diversity within her casts be it racially or gender. When asked by a fan why her shows featured so many gay characters she responded, ""Because I believe everyone should get to see themselves reflected on TV. EVERYONE. ""And because I love all my gay and lesbian friends,"" she continued. ""AND because I think same-sex marriage is the civil rights fight of our era and back when being a person of color was the civil rights fight, people like Norman Lear put black people on TV and helped change some minds. So you know, it's gotta be paid forward."" 4.Rapid-fire dialogue . Try to keep up with all of the snappy lines on these three shows. We dare you. The fast word play on ""Scandal"" has come to be so well-known that the actors have even been asked to explain how they keep up. 5. Interracial relationships . It doesn't get much hotter than Olivia Pope and President Fitzgerald ""Fitz"" Thomas Grant III on ""Scandal."" But let us not forget Sandra Oh's and Isaiah Washington as doctors Cristina Yang and Preston Burke. There is also an interracial relationship in ""How to Get Away With Murder"" which we won't reveal here (no spoilers!). Love knows no color in Shondaland. 6. Anyone can go at any time . Rhimes has absolutely no fear in killing off major and minor characters at any point to further a good plot. When actor T.R. Knight wanted out of playing Dr. George O'Malley on ""Grey's Anatomy"" in 2009, the character didn't just move away -- it appears that he was hit by a bus.

"China's skylines could look a lot more uniform in the years to come, if a statement by a Beijing official is to believed. The backlash against ""weird buildings"" escalated earlier this week when the capital's vice mayor, Chen Gang, announced that the city would be taking a greater role in influencing its structures' aesthetics. The city plans to implement ""building ordinances to govern the city's building size, style, color and materials,"" Chinese state media reported. China's cities, with their huge growth and increasingly bold architectural choices, have been a boon to the architecture industry over the past decade or so, with eye-catching structures popping up across the country. However, following Chinese President Xi Jinping's remarks, which call for an end of ""weird architecture,"" to a symposium in October, it seems as though there might be a politically-motivated directive at hand. The comments were widely reported in Chinese media. Chen's announcement is ostensibly to allow urban planning a greater hand in creating public spaces and ""a better cityscape"" for residents. When contacted by CNN, the municipal government declined to comment further. ""Like a pendulum"" Some are not concerned. Pritzker-prize laureate Rem Koolhaas, whose landmark CCTV building in the capital is often used as an illustration in media reports of so-called ""weird architecture"" told CNN that there have been previous, similar edicts. ""There have been periods (in China) where ordinances existed, there were mayors who insisted (to put) Chinese roofs on modern buildings but it's like a pendulum,"" he said while attending a design conference in Hong Kong. He says he's holding off making judgment until the updated ordinances were expanded upon. ""I'd like to see (the rules when they are announced). There was a rule that buildings had to be grey, and the CCTV building is grey, and I don't think it is diminished because of that."" Koolhaas is quick to clarify that the ""weird buildings"" remarks were not directly aimed at his flagship China project. ""The media has made that connection. No more weird buildings, it's understandable if you look around and I don't feel that CCTV is a weird building so that's my comment."" Stifling creativity . Hong Kong-based architect William To, project director at the Hong Kong Design Centre, however, decried Chinese attempts to rein in creativity. ""Wouldn't (the ordinances) make everything pretty much the same? Then they're not giving the young creative industries a chance to come up with new ideas or innovation."" To said that the proposed rulings would stifle what has been a playground for architects. ""That's setting parameters on creativity and this will limit or kill a lot of great ideas. From creativity there shouldn't be boundaries. For new ideas and new projects to take shape, thinking out of the box is essential. By putting parameters you're limiting (architects) to remain in the box. Cheng Taining, from the Chinese Academy of Engineering, says that China's unorthodox skylines are the result of a ""judgment imbalance,"" according to the China Daily. ""These weird buildings are too alienated from basic architectural norms and ... have become super-sized art installations that jump on the desire and vanity bandwagon,"" he told the paper.","Beijing authorities announce plans to place restrictions on new building designs, materials .
Vice-mayoral announcement comes shortly after President Xi Jinping called for no more ""weird buildings""

"William Gibson's popular science fiction tale ""Johnny Mnemonic"" foresaw sensitive information being carried by microchips in the brain by 2021. A team of American neuroscientists could be making this fantasy world a reality. Their motivation is different but the outcome would be somewhat similar. Hailed as one of 2013's top ten technological breakthroughs by MIT, the work by the University of Southern California, North Carolina's Wake Forest University and other partners has actually spanned a decade. But the U.S.-wide team now thinks that it will see a memory device being implanted in a small number of human volunteers within two years and available to patients in five to 10 years. They can't quite contain their excitement. ""I never thought I'd see this in my lifetime,"" said Ted Berger, professor of biomedical engineering at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. ""I might not benefit from it myself but my kids will."" Rob Hampson, associate professor of physiology and pharmacology at Wake Forest University, agrees. ""We keep pushing forward, every time I put an estimate on it, it gets shorter and shorter."" The scientists -- who bring varied skills to the table, including mathematical modeling and psychiatry -- believe they have cracked how long-term memories are made, stored and retrieved and how to replicate this process in brains that are damaged, particularly by stroke or localized injury. Berger said they record a memory being made, in an undamaged area of the brain, then use that data to predict what a damaged area ""downstream"" should be doing. Electrodes are then used to stimulate the damaged area to replicate the action of the undamaged cells. They concentrate on the hippocampus -- part of the cerebral cortex which sits deep in the brain -- where short-term memories become long-term ones. Berger has looked at how electrical signals travel through neurons there to form those long-term memories and has used his expertise in mathematical modeling to mimic these movements using electronics. Hampson, whose university has done much of the animal studies, adds: ""We support and reinforce the signal in the hippocampus but we are moving forward with the idea that if you can study enough of the inputs and outputs to replace the function of the hippocampus, you can bypass the hippocampus."" The team's experiments on rats and monkeys have shown that certain brain functions can be replaced with signals via electrodes. You would think that the work of then creating an implant for people and getting such a thing approved would be a Herculean task, but think again. For 15 years, people have been having brain implants to provide deep brain stimulation to treat epilepsy and Parkinson's disease -- a reported 80,000 people have now had such devices placed in their brains. So many of the hurdles have already been overcome -- particularly the ""yuck factor"" and the fear factor. ""It's now commonly accepted that humans will have electrodes put in them -- it's done for epilepsy, deep brain stimulation, (that has made it) easier for investigative research, it's much more acceptable now than five to 10 years ago,"" Hampson says. Much of the work that remains now is in shrinking down the electronics. ""Right now it's not a device, it's a fair amount of equipment,""Hampson says. ""We're probably looking at devices in the five to 10 year range for human patients."" The ultimate goal in memory research would be to treat Alzheimer's Disease but unlike in stroke or localized brain injury, Alzheimer's tends to affect many parts of the brain, especially in its later stages, making these implants a less likely option any time soon. Berger foresees a future, however, where drugs and implants could be used together to treat early dementia. Drugs could be used to enhance the action of cells that surround the most damaged areas, and the team's memory implant could be used to replace a lot of the lost cells in the center of the damaged area. ""I think the best strategy is going to involve both drugs and devices,"" he says. Unfortunately, the team found that its method can't help patients with advanced dementia. ""When looking at a patient with mild memory loss, there's probably enough residual signal to work with, but not when there's significant memory loss,"" Hampson said. Constantine Lyketsos, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at John Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore which is trialing a deep brain stimulator implant for Alzheimer's patients was a little skeptical of the other team's claims. ""The brain has a lot of redundancy, it can function pretty well if loses one or two parts. But memory involves circuits diffusely dispersed throughout the brain so it's hard to envision."" However, he added that it was more likely to be successful in helping victims of stroke or localized brain injury as indeed its makers are aiming to do. The UK's Alzheimer's Society is cautiously optimistic. ""Finding ways to combat symptoms caused by changes in the brain is an ongoing battle for researchers. An implant like this one is an interesting avenue to explore,"" said Doug Brown, director of research and development. Hampson says the team's breakthrough is ""like the difference between a cane, to help you walk, and a prosthetic limb -- it's two different approaches."" It will still take time for many people to accept their findings and their claims, he says, but they don't expect to have a shortage of volunteers stepping forward to try their implant -- the project is partly funded by the U.S. military which is looking for help with battlefield injuries. There are U.S. soldiers coming back from operations with brain trauma and a neurologist at DARPA (the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) is asking ""what can you do for my boys?"" Hampson says. ""That's what it's all about.""","U.S. researchers hoping to start human trials of memory implants in next two years .

"For years, chocolate, jewelry and flowers have been Valentine's Day staples. However, many consumers are now giving gifts that not only say I love you, but also help those in need. Recently, the concept of giving back through consuming gained traction with TOMS shoes, the company that makes the popular slip-on shoes and donates a pair to a child in need for every pair sold. TOMS seemed to open the door for other socially conscious brands, ones that make a difference through product sales. Now, many entrepreneurs are opening businesses and nonprofit organizations that produce socially conscious goods. From backpacks that provide an education to jewelry that empowers women to crocheted goods that help people rise out of poverty, here are three socially conscious companies that are trying to change the world with their products. Buy a backpack, fund an education in Tanzania . Matthew Clough traveled to Tanzania to climb Mount Kilimanjaro in 2008. ""I always had this dream of climbing each continent's highest summit. One of my buddies called me and asked if I wanted to climb Kilimanjaro, the highest peak in Africa. It was my first opportunity to check one of those seven summits off the list,"" says Clough. Little did he know, reaching the peak would inspire him to pursue an even loftier goal. Clough realized that his success on the mountain would have been impossible without the help of the porters who carried his extra gear, prepared his meals and ultimately guided him to the summit. As Clough descended the mountain, he discovered that his porters made less than a dollar a day -- an amount he later learned was not nearly enough to put a child in Tanzania through school. After returning to the United States, Clough made it his mission to provide education opportunities for underserved communities. He started stone + cloth, a backpack company that donates part of its profits to support children's education in Tanzania. ""I decided to make backpacks to create a symbol linking my mountaineering trip with education. I kept thinking about how I used a backpack for school as a kid and wanted to create a tool for people to use to spread the word about educating those in need."" All stone + cloth backpacks are made in Los Angeles, with $10 from every backpack purchased going directly to its partner in Tanzania, the Knock Foundation. Together with the Knock Foundation, stone + cloth supports education programs, including tuition assistance, school meals, and school supplies -- the learning essentials. ""By purchasing a backpack our customers carry an education,"" says Clough. Beads of hope help women in Uganda . Kallie Dovel traveled to Uganda in the summer of 2007 to volunteer. She began working with women at an after-school program and quickly learned about the hardships they faced after years of conflict in the region. While getting to know the women, Dovel was introduced to jewelry they made from paper beads. ""They showed me this beautiful product but told me they weren't able to sell it. In Uganda [the jewelry made from paper beads] is looked down on,"" says Dovel. The women at the school taught Dovel how to make the paper beads and asked her to sell the jewelry for them in the United States. Dovel agreed to purchase a box from them and try to sell some pieces when she got back home. The jewelry sold quickly and inspired Dovel to team up with her friends Jessie Simonson, Anna Nelson, Brooke Hodges and Alli Swanson to create the company 31 Bits. In August of 2008, the five traveled to Uganda and started purchasing jewelry from six women, promising to employ them for at least two years. Dovel stayed in Uganda in order to oversee operations while Simonson, Nelson, Hodges and Swanson traveled back to the States to spread brand awareness. Through its success, 31 Bits has been able to hire more women and launch programs for its Ugandan employees that include English lessons, health education, and business development programs. More than 100 Ugandan women now participate in 31 Bits programs, and the company reports it has raised more than $500,000 for women it employs through product sales. Programs provide participants the skills they need to support their families and communities, allowing the company ""to empower women to be self-sufficient."" Crocheting empowers women in Uganda, Peru . Stewart Ramsey was inspired to create the nonprofit organization Krochet Kids International after traveling to Uganda in the summer of 2006. Ramsey met a group of refugees who for 20 years had depended on government and aid organizations for food and protection as a result of war. When Ramsey returned, he brought with him a message that he passed on to his two childhood friends. The refugees he met were tired of handouts. They wanted to have jobs and provide for themselves. Ramsey's friends took this message to heart and the three decided to act. Together, Ramsey, Kohl Crecelius and Travis Hartanov set out to provide the tools, knowledge and opportunities needed to enable Ugandan refugees to better their circumstances; but first they had to figure out how. Years earlier, while still in high school, the three had made extra money crocheting hats. ""[We] sold them to friends of ours who were skiers and snowboarders in the Northwest. And it was the one thing we knew that we could [teach] people and even provide a job for in the process,"" Crecelius explains. The group traveled to Uganda in 2007 and taught 10 women to crochet. Ramsey, Crecelius and Hartanov sold the hats in the United States, providing income for the women they employed. The company's success has allowed for expansion of programs into Peru; they currently employ more than 150 women in the two countries. More than 250,000 hats have been sold, with each one personally signed by its creator. As a nonprofit, Krochet Kids International has been able to raise $5 million, which has gone to teaching and empowering the women in its programs and allowing them to rise above poverty. Stone + cloth, 31 Bits, and Krochet Kids International provide three different ways consumers can show their love for that special someone while making the world a better place. By informing themselves about companies' social policies and programs, consumers can channel their purchasing power to make an impact.","Brands that not only make a profit but make a difference are becoming more popular .

"Just stay home. That's the message from officials in the path of the South's latest nasty winter weather. In Atlanta, where less than 3 inches of snow recently brought the city to a grinding, gridlocked halt, drivers and officials seemed to have learned some lessons. Roadways were uncongested and schools closed across the metro area Tuesday morning, hours ahead of most of the expected inclement weather. Much of the city heeded the advice of local officials who advised drivers to avoid the roads from Tuesday through midday Thursday. By late Tuesday afternoon, flight cancellations for Wednesday were stacking up with about 1,700 canceled across the United States. More than 1,100 of those Wednesday cancellations were heading to or from the world's busiest airport in Atlanta. At Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International, more than 400 Tuesday flights were also canceled out of more than 1,200 U.S. flight cancellations on Tuesday, according to flight tracking site FlightAware.com. 24 hours at the world's busiest airport . On Tuesday afternoon, Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines said it had canceled more than 1,500 Wednesday Delta and Delta Connection flights. The airline moved quickly Monday night to cancel more than 500 Tuesday flights ahead of the storm, according to spokesman Morgan Durrant. All Wednesday Southwest Airlines and AirTran Airways departures -- about 160 flights -- are canceled in Atlanta, according to a statement from the joint airlines. The airport in Charlotte, North Carolina, is another spot where operations are getting snarled by winter weather, with more than 450 Wednesday flight cancellations at Charlotte-Douglas International Airport, according to FlightAware. That's after more than 300 Tuesday cancellations. Atlanta's guide to snow survival . The Atlanta airport ramped up winter storm operations Monday night, putting essential employees on 12-hour shifts in preparation for the week's bad weather.  The airport said in a statement that it ""will remain open and fully operational this week."" The airport has 11 de-icing pads, 100,000 gallons of de-icing fluids and 50,000 pounds of de-icing pellets ready to treat icy aircraft and runways as well as 50,000 pounds of a salt/sand mixture to treat the airport roadways, according to spokesman Reese McCranie. During the last winter storm, the airport went through 13,000 gallons of de-icing fluid, 35,000 pounds of de-icing pellets and 35,000 pounds of the salt/sand mixture, McCranie said. Those materials will surely be needed if forecasts calling for freezing precipitation through much of Wednesday hold true. ""Accordingly, Atlanta will not be on a regular schedule until Thursday at the earliest,""  wrote Daniel Baker, chief of executive officer of FlightAware.com. Airline customers should check their flight status with airlines before departing for the airport. Many airlines are offering flexible, no-fee changes to travel dates. For those who must travel, North Carolina's Department of Transportation cautions drivers to reduce their speed, leave plenty of room between vehicles and approach bridges and overpasses with extreme caution. Do not apply your brakes on a bridge or if your car begins to slide. If your car begins to slip, turn the steering wheel in the direction of the slide and take your foot off the gas, the department advises. AAA advises motorists to check tire pressure and make sure car batteries, cooling systems and antifreeze levels are in order. Keep gas tanks close to full, the automobile association advises, so you'll be able to run the engine for heat in case you get stranded. AAA suggests keeping the following items in your car: a shovel and a bag of sand; a snowbrush and ice scraper; jumper cables; a spare tire; windshield wiper fluid; a cell phone and car charger; and blankets, gloves, hats and food, water and essential medication. Conserve the battery life on your cell phone by turning it off when not expecting or making a call.","Nearly 1,100  Atlanta flights canceled ahead of winter storm for Wednesday .

"UK police arrested two more men Friday in connection with an investigation into suspected membership of a banned organization. It comes a day after nine men were arrested in London on terrorism charges, one of them named in British media reports as radical British cleric Anjem Choudary. The two latest arrests came in the early hours in a swoop on a vehicle traveling on the M6 motorway, which runs northwest from the English Midlands to Manchester and beyond. One suspect, aged 33, was arrested on suspicion of being a member of a banned organization, supporting a banned organization and encouraging terrorism, London's Metropolitan Police said in a statement. The second man, aged 42, was arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender. Both remain in custody at a central London police station. The nine men arrested Thursday, ages 22 to 51, also remain in custody in London, police said. Searches continue at a number of addresses. ""These arrests and searches are part of an ongoing investigation into Islamist related terrorism and are not in response to any immediate public safety risk,"" the police statement said. Radical cleric . Anjem Choudary, who was a co-founder of the banned UK Islamist group Al Muhajiroun, told CNN last month that the world had been split into two camps. There's a ""camp which believes that sovereignty and supremacy belongs to God. They are the Islamic State, at the head of which is Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi,"" Choudary said. ""In the other camp you have those people who believe sovereignty and supremacy belongs to man. At the head of that camp is Barack Obama."" ""I believe this Islamic State will spread, rapidly, and I believe it will be in Europe and even America within decades."" Police have not named the suspects or the banned organization concerned. Cameron lays out plans to counter UK jihadi threat . Terror threat level raised . The Home Office has listed 60 international proscribed terrorist organizations as of August 2014. They include networks such as ISIS and al Qaeda, as well as UK-based groups such as Al Muhajiroun, which emerged in 1996 and has operated under a range of other names since being disbanded in 2004 and banned in 2010. The UK Home Office last month raised its terror threat level from ""substantial"" to ""severe."" The government also announced new measures to combat the threat from Islamist extremism, including a radical new measure to ban Britons from coming home once they join jihadi ranks abroad. UK authorities estimate that 500 Britons have gone to Syria and Iraq to fight with Islamist groups.","London's Metropolitan Police arrest two men in a swoop on a vehicle on a highway .

"A New York judge Tuesday rejected claims by former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn that a civil lawsuit against him should be dismissed because he was protected by diplomatic immunity. Bronx Supreme Court Justice Douglas McKeon denied a motion by Strauss-Kahn's lawyers to dismiss the lawsuit, which was filed by a hotel maid who accused him of sexual assault last year. A lawyer for the maid, Nafissatou Diallo, said his client was pleased with the decision. ""We are extremely pleased with Judge McKeon's well-reasoned and articulate decision recognizing that Strauss-Kahn is not entitled to immunity,"" said attorney Douglas H. Wigdor. ""We have said all along that Strauss-Kahn's desperate plea for immunity was a tactic designed to delay these proceedings and we now look forward to holding him accountable for the brutal sexual assault that he committed."" Strauss-Kahn headed the IMF, an international organization of 187 member-states with headquarters in Washington. The IMF provides loans to countries that are suffering economic difficulties. He resigned his position soon after his arrest by New York police in May 2011, when he was charged with criminally assaulting a housekeeper in a Manhattan hotel suite. Diallo accused Strauss-Kahn of raping her when she entered his suite to clean it. Police subsequently removed him from an Air France flight that was about to depart New York's Kennedy Airport and jailed him before his arraignment in criminal court. Strauss-Kahn's attorneys later said a consensual sexual encounter did take place with the maid but there was no force involved. The arrest of such a high-profile international political figure who was preparing a presidential run in his native France sparked worldwide media interest. But the criminal case against Strauss-Kahn was later dropped by New York prosecutors, because of credibility issues they cited in Diallo's account. ""At the end of the day, they did something very courageous by dismissing the case,"" one of his lawyers, Benjamin Brafman, told CNN's Piers Morgan Monday night. ""It took a lot of guts to do that. It was the right decision. That case was fed by a media frenzy unlike any I've seen."" In August, Diallo's lawyers served Strauss-Kahn with a civil suit seeking damages stemming from the alleged assault in the hotel. Strauss-Kahn's lawyers did not invoke his immunity from prosecution during the criminal case. Wigdor ridiculed the fact that they would invoke it in the civil case, but not the criminal case, as ""piecemeal immunity."" But Strauss-Kahn attorney Amit Mehta countered that his client was eager to assert his innocence in the criminal proceedings, so he didn't invoke whatever immunity he enjoyed as IMF chief. In his decision, the judge wrote that ""Mr. Strauss-Kahn cannot eschew immunity in an effort to clear his name only to embrace it now in an effort to deny Ms. Diallo the opportunity to clear hers."" In the months following Diallo's accusation last year, other allegations surfaced. Anne Mansouret, a Socialist member of the French parliament, said Strauss-Kahn had attacked her daughter. A complaint was filed, alleging a 2002 attack, though it could not be pursued because the statute of limitations had expired. Currently, Strauss-Kahn faces another legal battle -- this time centering on an investigation into a high-profile prostitution network operating out of luxury hotels in the French city of Lille. Strauss-Kahn has been formally warned by French authorities that he is under investigation for ""aggravated pimping,"" and has been released on 100,000-euro bail. He has pushed back against the accusations, saying he did not know young women at parties he attended were being paid for sex.","A motion to dismiss the case was denied .

"The U.S. ambassador to NATO says the alliance has no plans for military intervention in the Syrian crisis, as reports of deaths mount by the dozens and diplomatic efforts have yet to stymie the bloodshed. Ivo Daalder told reporters late Sunday there is ""no planning going on that's related to a NATO role in Syria."" ""As it relates to NATO planning, a NATO ally has to come forward and request that type of planning.  So that's a circumstance that hasn't taken place,"" the ambassador said. ""We'd obviously take any requests of that nature seriously if it were to be made."" Daalder also said that NATO, along with European allies and Arab partners, has provided assistance to the Syrian opposition, including political and diplomatic support. ""We've also decided, however, that a military intervention of the nature that we did in Libya would further militarize the situation in ways that wouldn't necessarily protect civilian life,"" Daalder said. ""... Unlike Libya, you don't have pockets of the country that can be protected by civilian protection zones. You've got security forces intermingled with the population, and that introduction of greater military intervention from outside or arms to groups within Syria could further militarize the conflict in a counterproductive way."" On the same day Daalder spoke, at least 60 people were killed in Syria's 14-month crisis, opposition activists said. Among the dead, at least 40 were killed in the northwestern city of Hama, where a neighborhood sustained heavy shelling by government troops, said the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, a network of opposition activists. On Monday, activists said, six people died across the country. The deaths included three unidentified bodies. The United Nations says at least 9,000 people have been killed since initially peaceful protests against President Bashar al-Assad erupted in March 2011. Opposition activists put the toll at more than 11,000. Syria's government, meanwhile, said it buried 18 more members of its security forces who died battling ""armed terrorist groups"" around the country. CNN cannot independently verify reports of deaths and violence because the Syrian government has severely restricted access by international media. The fighting has continued despite a peace plan brokered by former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, now a special envoy for the United Nations and the Arab League.","At least six people have been killed Monday, according to opposition activists .

"(CNN) -- On Friday, August 4, 1944 -- a beautiful summer morning, not unlike the one on which I am writing this now -- a car pulled up in front of a spice warehouse at 263 Prinsengracht in Amsterdam. Inside the car were an Austrian Gestapo officer and his Dutch subordinates, who, acting on a tip-off (whose source has never been identified), had come to arrest the eight Jews who had been hiding for two years in an attic above the warehouse. The eight prisoners were taken to a deportation camp, from where they were sent to Auschwitz. Only one of them, Otto Frank, would survive. It is because of one of youngest of those prisoners, Anne -- 15 at the time of her arrest -- that we know the names of the people who endured under those extraordinary circumstances, and who tried heroically to lead normal lives, although, during the daylight hours, they were forbidden to move or make noise. The diary that Anne had received for her 13th birthday, which she had kept up during their time in the ""secret annex,"" and which she had revised during her family's last few months in hiding, has outlived her by decades. It has become a classic of world literature, translated, reprinted and read throughout the world. She made her final entry in the diary 70 years ago Friday, sounding like a typical soul-searching adolescent. Often, reading Anne Frank's diary is the way in which young people first learn about the horrors of the Nazi genocide. Just as importantly, young readers understand that these crimes were visited upon a girl much like themselves and their friends -- a girl who was often in conflict with her mother, a girl who kept vowing to be a more patient and forgiving person, a girl who fell in love for the first time. A girl who wanted to be a writer -- and who was one. Though the circumstances of her final years (she died, at 15, in Bergen-Belsen) were so terrible and extreme, her inner life and her voice seem almost shockingly contemporary, astonishingly similar to the voices of the teenagers we know. We cannot help but be amazed that an adolescent girl could have written so movingly and intelligently about a subject that continues to overwhelm the adult imagination. Because of this book, we will remember the names, the quirks -- the characters -- of the eight people who inhabited the secret annex and their brave Dutch helpers. We will be able to visualize them long after everyone who witnessed that horrific era is gone. It is because of Anne's diary that she and her family are among the few we will remember -- the ones we feel we know -- among the millions who suffered and died as she did. All of this should bolster the argument to be made against those who wish to remove some literature from the curriculum that our children study because it is not ""practical,"" not ""useful,"" because literature (like Anne Frank's diary) is a frivolous luxury compared with the more ""necessary"" subjects that today's young people must master. What could be more ""practical"" than to learn (from the inside, from the first-person point of view of someone who experienced it) the history of the world in which we live, the history that has made us who we are -- and to learn that this history happened not to anonymous masses but to individuals much like ourselves and our children. What could be more ""useful"" than to view that era through the mind and eyes -- and in the words -- of a girl who wanted us to know who she was and what happened to her. And what could be more necessary than the story of a girl who wanted to grow up, to become a writer, to lead a full and normal life -- and was prevented from doing so, by the forces of prejudice and hatred, on a beautiful and otherwise ordinary August morning.","Francine Prose: Anne Frank made her final entry in her diary 70 years ago Friday .

"(CNN) -- As fighting rages in Gaza, a question about the region has shot to the forefront of international politics: More than three years after Israel pulled out from the small strip of land, is it still ""occupied"" territory? An Israeli helicopter gunship fires a missile Tuesday at a target in Gaza. ""They are re-invading occupied territory,"" Palestinian legislator Hanan Ashrawi said on ""CNN Sunday Morning."" She added that Israel has ""all the powers and none of the responsibilities of the occupying force."" Ambassador Reda Mansour, Israel's consul general to the Southeastern United States, decried ""the same old story about 'occupation.'"" He added, ""We didn't have, until the last 48 hours, one soldier inside Gaza. We didn't have one settler there."" The United Nations still calls Gaza ""occupied,"" although U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon last year balked at the question. U.S. government Web sites also describe Gaza as ""occupied."" Israel's supreme court ruled last year that after the disengagement, Israel ""had no effective control over what occurred"" inside Gaza, according to the Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Israel's relationship to the two separate Palestinian territories -- Gaza and the West Bank -- is one of the most sensitive topics in the world. The issue is further complicated by the fact that Hamas -- the Palestinian political party whose militant wing has killed Israeli civilians through terrorist attacks -- and many other groups in the Middle East consider all of Israel an occupation of what should be Palestine. Background . Gaza's history can be traced from ancient Egypt through to the Ottoman Empire. Beginning in 1920, it was part of the British-ruled Mandate of Palestine. In 1948, Egypt gained control of Gaza during the Arab-Israeli war -- the same war that ultimately led to Israel's independence as a nation. During the six-day Arab-Israeli war of 1967, Israel took control of Gaza and the West Bank. In 1993, Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) signed agreements that led to the withdrawal of Israeli troops from most of Gaza in 1994. Ten years later, following numerous failed peace efforts, Israel -- under Prime Minister Ariel Sharon -- announced a plan to remove all Jewish settlements and Israeli troops from Gaza by the end of 2005. On September 11, 2005, the disengagement was complete. As CNN reported, ""The Israeli flag has been lowered over Gaza, symbolizing the end of 38 years of Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territory two weeks ahead of schedule."" But Palestinian leaders say that despite the symbolism, the disengagement did not end the occupation. Israel has ""besieged Gaza,"" Ashrawi said Sunday. ""They control the territorial waters, the airspace, the land crossing points and they gave themselves overriding security consideration or powers."" Israel says the steps it has taken are necessary to protect Israeli citizens from terrorist attacks by Hamas, which controls Palestinian life in Gaza. ""They can't live without blaming the Israelis for all the troubles of Gaza,"" Mansour said. ""Gaza is a great place, it should be a very advanced place. Israel was willing to develop it. ... We want to make it one of the most advanced areas of the Middle East. There could be tourism, there's natural gas, there's so much resources to use in Gaza."" Palestinian officials argue that terrorism and poverty wouldn't flourish in the region if Israel eased restrictions. Israel says the terrorism must stop so it can ease restrictions. The U.N. position . In February 2008, Secretary-General Ban was asked at a media availability whether Gaza is occupied territory. ""I am not in a position to say on these legal matters,"" he responded. The next day, at a press briefing, a reporter pointed out to a U.N. spokesman that the secretary-general had told Arab League representatives that Gaza was still considered occupied. ""Yes, the U.N. defines Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem as Occupied Palestinian Territory. No, that definition hasn't changed,"" the spokesman replied. Farhan Haq, spokesman for the secretary-general, told CNN Monday that the official status of Gaza would change only through a decision of the U.N. Security Council. The U.S. position . The CIA World Factbook says: ""West Bank and Gaza Strip are Israeli-occupied with current status subject to the Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement -- permanent status to be determined through further negotiation; Israel removed settlers and military personnel from the Gaza Strip in August 2005."" The U.S. State Department Web site also includes Gaza when it discusses the ""occupied"" territories. State Department spokeswoman Amanda Harper referred CNN Monday to the department's Web site for any questions about the status of Gaza, and she noted that the Web site referred to the 2005 disengagement. When asked the department's position on whether Gaza is still occupied, Harper said she would look into it. She has not yet contacted CNN with any more information. Israel's supreme court . Israel's court system has dealt with legal questions involving Israel's responsibility for Gaza after the withdrawal in 2005. In January 2008, the supreme court ruled in a case involving the shipping of fuel into Gaza. ""The Israeli Supreme Court determined that since Israel had disengaged from the Gaza Strip it had no effective control over what occurred there,"" Israel's ministry of foreign affairs says on its Web site. ""The judges also determined that Israel had no commitment 'to deal with the welfare of the residents of the Gaza Strip or to allow unlimited amounts of goods and merchandise' to pass through, but only vital and humanitarian goods."" Occupation of the West Bank . The Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on its Web site, notes that in 1967 the Israel Defense Forces completed the ""occupation of West Bank and Gaza Strip."" After the 1993 peace agreements, Israel withdrew its troops from much of the West Bank. But in 2002, amid a slew of terrorist attacks from extremists in the region, Israel reoccupied most cities from which it had withdrawn. While Israel pulled out of Gaza in 2005, its troops remain in the West Bank and the number of Jewish settlers in that area has grown. Israel says its actions in the area, including building of a separation barrier, have helped prevent terrorists from entering Israel. Palestinians say it has increased the misery for Palestinians and further delayed any prospects for peace. Hamas: Israel's existence is an occupation . To Hamas, Israel's ""occupation"" is not limited to Gaza and the West Bank. Like many other Islamic militant groups, Hamas views Israel's presence as the de facto occupier of greater Palestine. Hamas' charter calls for the destruction of Israel altogether. As former Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu said on CNN's ""Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer"" on Sunday, ""They say, 'Look, we're firing these rockets to liberate occupied Palestine, occupied Ashkelon, occupied Ashdod, occupied Tel Aviv. To them, any place that Israel sits on, any square inch of Israel is occupied territory, and Israel has to be destroyed.'""","Question of Gaza ""occupation"" at forefront of international politics .

"New York (CNN) -- Officer Rafael Ramos sat in the driver's seat. Officer Wenjian Liu was at his side. The two cops weren't at their usual precinct -- normally, the pair was assigned to downtown Brooklyn, but they were working a ""critical response"" detail in an area with higher crime, police said. That's where they were slain, ambush-style -- Saturday afternoon as they sat in their patrol car, New York Police Commissioner William Bratton said at an evening news conference. The gunman approached the passenger side of the patrol car and took a shooting stance, witnesses told police. He opened fire several times, striking both officers in the head, Bratton said. They were ""shot and killed with no warning, no provocation,"" Bratton told reporters. ""They were quite simply, assassinated."" The gunman was found dead in a nearby subway station from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The thin blue line . The families of the fallen officers rushed to Woodhull Medical Center on Saturday, as dozens of their comrades gathered in a show of support. Ramos had just turned 40 this month; Liu got married two months ago. Both dreamed of being police officers, Bratton said. ""One of the unfortunate realities of policing is that you put that blue uniform on and you become part of the thin blue line between us and anarchy,"" Bratton said. Mayor Bill de Blasio and Bratton met with the families of the victims. De Blasio said that Ramos' 13-year-old son couldn't comprehend what had happened to his father. ""When a police officer is murdered, it tears at the foundation of our society,"" the mayor said. ""It is an attack on the very concept of decency."" The suspect . Police identified the shooter as Ismaaiyl Brinsley. He arrived in New York from Baltimore, but had a residence in Atlanta. Bratton said that Brinsley was somehow connected to Brooklyn, but would not discuss that information. Bratton said at this time, there was no indication Brinsley was connected to any terrorist groups or organized entity. Police were investigating posts Brinsley allegedly made on social media. Bratton said that the suspect had earlier shot and seriously wounded a woman believed to be his ex-girlfriend in Baltimore. Baltimore police received information that Brinsley had made threatening comments about police, and sent a warning to police in New York, Bratton said. That message came almost the same time the ambush happened. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder called the attack ""an unspeakable act of barbarism."" De Blasio also called the shootings an ""assassination."" ""It is an attack on all of us,"" he said. ""It is an attack on everything we hold dear."" A White House official says President Barack Obama was briefed on the shooting. ""This can't happen"" The shooting jolted residents in the neighborhood. ""This can't happen. If you mad at somebody, be mad at the person that you are mad at. Now, we have two families that (are) missing somebody for the holidays,"" Shaniqua Pervis told CNN affiliate WABC. ""Where is your humanity? I know it's a war going on and shoutout to Eric Garner's family and everybody else who lost somebody, but you're not at his house, on his lawn. This is two (officers). You don't even know if (they were) good or bad. I don't condone this, and I'm not with it."" The woman was referring to the controversial July death of the unarmed black man after New York police officers on Staten Island wrestled him to the ground, with one of the officers wrapping his arm around Garner's neck in a chokehold. A grand jury's decision not to indict the police officer in the Garner case, as well as a separate grand jury's refusal to indict an officer in a controversial police shooting of unarmed teen Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, led to nationwide protests against the police. Brown's family condemned Saturday's slayings. ""We reject any kind of violence directed toward members of law enforcement. It cannot be tolerated. We must work together to bring peace to our communities,"" they said in a statement. ""Our thoughts and prayers go out to the officers' families during this incredibly difficult time."" In a statement, activist the Rev. Al Sharpton said the Garner family was outraged by news of the shootings. ""Any use of the names of Eric Garner and Michael Brown, in connection with any violence or killing of police, is reprehensible and against the pursuit of justice in both cases,"" the statement said. ""We have stressed at every rally and march that anyone engaged in any violence is an enemy to the pursuit of justice for Eric Garner and Michael Brown."" Tensions between the community and police have heightened around the country since the deaths of Brown and Garner. ""This could not have come at a worse time,"" City Councilman Robert Cornegy told CNN affiliate PIX. So far, police have not commented on the motive for the Brooklyn shootings, except to say the officers were not engaging the shooter in any way when they were shot. CNN's David Shortell, Mariano Castillo and Kevin Liptak contributed to this report.","Baltimore police reached out to NYPD .

"Three people were killed and another was seriously injured in a shooting Saturday at the Jewish Museum of Belgium in Brussels, Belgian officials said. A person arrived by car at the museum in central Brussels, entered and quickly opened fire before leaving the scene, Belgian Interior Minister Joelle Milquet told CNN affiliate Bel RTL. The circumstances of the shooting have raised suspicions that it may have been an anti-Semitic attack, but no motive has been determined. The shooter remains at large, and the nation's terror alert level was raised. Belgian public broadcaster RTBF quoted Brussels Mayor Yvan Mayeur as saying those killed were two men and a woman, while a man was seriously injured at the museum, which is near the tourist sites. Two of the dead were Israelis -- a couple in their 50's from Tel Aviv, Israel's foreign ministry said Sunday. At a press conference, Milquet said the threat level is highest at locations frequented by the Jewish community. This measure was precautionary, she added. Belgian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Affairs Minister Didier Reynders, who was nearby when the shooting occurred, told CNN affiliate RTL/TVI that he saw the victims inside the museum, then called the emergency services and put witnesses in touch with police. ""It seems that a car was double-parked and that a person went in and came out of the museum quickly after shots were fired,"" Reynders said. One witness managed to see the license plate of the vehicle used in the attack, according to Reynders. ""You can't help thinking, when you see a Jewish museum, to think about an anti-Semitic act, but the investigation will tell more,"" he said. The person involved in the attack was carrying bags, and police were asked to look inside the museum to ensure that no devices were left behind, Reynders added. Milquet told RTBF that the circumstances of the ""haphazard"" shooting ""could give rise to presumptions of an anti-Semitic act."" But she added that the matter was still under investigation. Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo expressed his shock and condolences via Twitter. 'We didn't expect such a terrible act' The European Jewish Congress also decried the attack, the group's president, Moshe Kantor, said in a statement. ""While we don't not yet have full information regarding the background to this attack, we are acutely aware of the permanent threat to Jewish targets in Belgium and across the whole of Europe,"" he said. ""This is once again, much like the savage murders in Toulouse, a clear example of where hate and anti-Semitism leads. European governments must send out a clear message of zero tolerance towards any manifestation of anti-Semitism."" Henry Goodman, president of the Jewish Community Center in Brussels, also drew a parallel with the attacks by a gunman in Toulouse, France, two years ago in which a rabbi, three Jewish children and three French paratroopers were killed, saying it ""must be the same logic."" He added, ""They, whoever they are, are not going to close the community activities. Jewish people know what anti-Semitism means. ""They are not going to silence us. ... We are going to survive and fight."" Goodman told CNN he was ""horrified"" by what had happened Saturday. ""We didn't expect such a terrible act. Since we don't know who has done it or the reason, we can only imagine that it is an act of pure anti-Semitism,"" he said. A crisis center has been opened by the Consistoire Central and the Coordinating Committee of Belgian Jewish Organisations, and community leaders are in direct and permanent contact with police, local authorities and emergency services. A global survey released in May by the Anti-Defamation League reported on the levels of anti-Semitism found in 102 nations. Belgium received a 27% index score in the survey. The index score represents the percentage of adults in a country who answered ""probably true"" to a majority of the anti-Semitic stereotypes tested. Belgium has an adult population of about 8.7 million. The ADL said one in four adults worldwide are ""deeply infected with anti-Semitic attitudes,"" according to a CNN.com report on the survey. France had an index score of 37%, Germany 27%, Spain 29%, Sweden 4% and the United Kingdom 8%. The United States was given an index score of 9%. 7 dead in California shooting rampage called 'premeditated mass murder'","Interior minister says terror alert level highest where Jewish community frequents .

"Tired of hokey in-flight movies or spotty DirecTV connections? United Airlines is adding an option for watching TV during flights that lets passengers stream content directly to their laptop, iPhone, iPad or iPod touch for free. The airline announced the new entertainment system in February and will roll it out on U.S. flights starting in April. United will preload 150 movies and 200 TV shows onto an on-board system. Passengers with compatible devices will be able to stream directly from a server on the plane, so there's no need to pay for in-flight WIFi service, and the airline won't have to worry about an entire airplane of people gobbling up bandwidth while binge-watching. United has chosen a combination of new and classic content, including popular TV shows ""Downton Abbey"" and Netflix's ""House of Cards"" to start. Eventually the aircraft will swap in fresh movies and episodes every month so frequent fliers don't run out of things to watch. The program does have some limitations. The most notable is that it only works with Apple smartphones and tablets running iOS 6 and above for the time being. To watch shows on an iOS device, passengers must download the official United app. Android users are out in the cold unless they have a laptop handy, but United is working on adding support. ""We expect to offer the same service for users of Android mobile devices later this year,"" said a United spokesperson. Passengers can watch the movies and shows only while in the air, but United plans on making it work from ""gate-to-gate"" to reflect recent changes in mobile device policies. Late last year, the FAA changed its policy to allow passengers to use mobile devices before and during takeoff and landing, at the discretion of the airlines. On computers, the streaming works with Windows computers running Windows XP and Windows 7. It requires the most recent versions of the Chrome, Firefox or Internet Explorer browsers. Mac laptops must have OS X 10.6 or higher and use Safari, Chrome or Firefox. The browsers must run Flash 10.3 or higher. For security reasons, some of the content can only be viewed with a specific browser plug-in, which can be downloaded in-flight. The first planes to offer the feature will be the Airbus A319 and A320, the Boeing 747-400 and some Boeing 777-200s. To decide if you need to download all three seasons of ""Veronica Mars"" before getting on a cross-country United flight, check to see whether the new in-flight mobile streaming service is offered by looking at the list of amenities for your flight.","United Airlines is adding free in-flight movie and TV streaming starting in April .

"The case of Yanira Maldonado brought international attention once more to the innocent people getting caught in Mexico's drug war. Maldonado, a U.S. citizen and mother of seven children, was released late last week after spending more than a week in a prison in Nogales, Mexico, accused of trying to transport marijuana aboard a bus. She and her husband, Gary, were returning on the  bus from a family funeral in Sonora, Mexico, when soldiers at a military checkpoint stopped them. The passengers were told to get out so that the soldiers and an official from the public prosecutor's office could inspect it. She was arrested and handed over to the official because soldiers said marijuana was found under her seat -- conviction could have meant a  minimum of 10 years in jail. A surveillance video showing her boarding the bus with only her purse, blankets and two bottles of water apparently exonerated her. Opinion: Shakedown 'justice' in Mexico . Unfortunately, not everyone is as lucky as Maldonado. The Washington Office on Latin America recently interviewed Rosa Julia Leyva Martinez, who described how one day in 1993 she decided to travel for the first time from her home state of Guerrero to Mexico City to buy some seeds for her plant nursery. According to her video testimony, she was afraid of traveling alone, and some people from her town persuaded her to travel with them. Without her knowledge, she says they had her carry a bag with heroin through airport security. She was blamed for the drugs and taken to police custody, where she says she was tortured and raped and forced to sign a confession. In jail, she learned to read, and the first thing she read was her conviction for drug trafficking for smuggling heroin, which sentenced her to 22 years in prison. She was released after nearly 11 years. As the Mexican government has stepped up its efforts to combat drug trafficking, the number of people who have been detained and accused of crimes related to drugs has dramatically increased. But they must struggle to defend themselves with often poor, or no, legal representation. A 2012 survey of the prison population by the Center for Research and Teaching in Economics in eight of Mexico's federal prisons found that the majority of the prisoners, 60%, were in jail for drug crimes. Of these prisoners, more than 43% said that they did not have a lawyer present when they presented their testimony before the public prosecutor's office, 44% said their lawyer did not explain to them what was happening during the trial, and 51% said their attorneys did not give them any advice. Just as telling is the small number of cases that are ever brought to trial. The Washington Office on Latin America and Transnational Institute did a study on drug laws in Latin America, including Mexico. It found that during the first four years of the government of Mexican President Felipe Calderón -- whose term ran from 2006 to 2012 -- of the 226,667 detainees accused of a drug crime, 33,5000, or  less than 15%, were ever sentenced. This finding suggests that in the majority of cases, the evidence presented against the accused wasn't strong enough for charges to be filed, and of those, relatively few held up in court. Mexico's justice system has a reputation for being rife with corruption -- with officials too often accused of negotiating with criminals or demanding or accepting bribes to set someone free. Indeed, Gary Maldonado said they demanded $5,000 to let his wife go. According to the Mexican Ministry of the Interior's 2012 National Survey of the Criminal Justice System, 6% of the Mexicans surveyed had confidence in the justice system. Responders said the main problems were that criminals are not held accountable, the system is corrupt, the judicial process slow, and the service from public servants is poor. In one high-profile case, 23 municipal police officers and two citizens from Tijuana, Baja California, were arrested in March 2009 and held under arraigo, a controversial pre-accusation detention period, while evidence was supposedly being gathered against them for alleged links to organized crime. Mexico's National Human Rights Commission documented that the agents were tortured during this detention period. Thirteen of the detained were released after spending almost a year and a half in jail; the rest were released after 3½ years, and the charges against them dropped. The Mexican government has recognized the urgent need to change the country's criminal justice system. In 2008,  important constitutional and legislative reforms were passed that could transform Mexico's legal system to an adversarial judicial model with oral trials. This new system is very different from Mexico's traditional inquisitorial model, where most of the evidence is presented in written form to the judge and the proceedings take place largely outside of the public view. If fully put into place, the reforms should make the justice system more effective, efficient and transparent. In his first few months in office, new Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto has affirmed his commitment to implement fully the justice reform at the state and federal level. It will be no small task. Five years after the constitutional reform went into effect, only three of Mexico's 32 states are working under the new system, and it is partially operational in only 10 others. In support, the United States has  provided more than  $100 million to help Mexico fully adopt the adversarial justice system and to address weaknesses in criminal justice institutions. Last year, Mexican human rights defender Leopoldo Maldonado stated that the country's justice system had become a ""factory for producing guilty people."" Mexicans -- and indeed anyone accused of committing a crime in Mexico -- deserve better. A full transition to an adversarial system is essential to bring criminals to justice, strengthen the rule of law and provide due process guarantees for the accused. Continued U.S. support is essential as more states and the federal government work to build the criminal justice system that Mexico desperately needs. As in Yanira Maldonado's case, too many people in Mexico have been deemed guilty until proven innocent.","Maureen Meyer: U.S. woman jailed in Mexico one of many caught in corrupt system .

"The mutants might be fighting for their lives in ""X-Men: Days of Future Past,"" but everything is smooth-sailing for the explosive, star-studded saga at the box office. Professor X (old and young) and his friends helped usher in a mighty $111 million domestically for ""X-Men's"" first four days in theaters.

EW: 'X-Men: Days of Future Past': Oh God, let's talk about that ending . Adam Sandler was less lucky with ""Blended,"" which made its debut in the No. 3 spot with $18.2 million in its first four days in theaters. The $45 million PG-13 rated Warner Bros. pic suffered from dismal reviews (15 percent on Rotten Tomatoes), resulting in one of Sandler's worst comedy openings in almost two decades. In 2011, for example, ""Jack and Jill"" earned $25 million in its first three days in theaters. Moviegoers seemed to enjoy ""Blended"" nonetheless, giving it a solid A- Cinema Score. Holdovers include ""Godzilla,"" which plummeted in weekend two with an estimated $39.45 million over the four-day span, with IMAX showings (352 screens) accounting for nearly $6 million of that total. But, the Warner Bros. and Legendary pic still looks to be on track for a $200 million domestic tally.

"A day after men armed with long knives stormed a railway station in the southwest Chinese city of Kunming, killing dozens of people and wounding more than 100, authorities described what happened as a premeditated terrorist attack. Police shot dead at least four of the attackers -- who numbered more than 10 -- and were looking for the others, officials told the state-run Xinhua News Agency. Premier Li Keqiang asked that security in public places be tightened. But for Chen Guizhen, that request came too late. The 50-year-old woman told Xinhua at the hospital that her husband, Xiong Wenguang, 59, was killed in the attack. ""Why are the terrorists so cruel?"" asked Chen, her husband's bloody ID card shaking in her hands. The attackers gave no warning. Liu Chen, a 19-year-old student from Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei Province, was at the station to buy tickets when the attack began. ""At first I thought it was just someone fighting, but then I saw blood and heard people scream, and I just ran,"" she said. Lu Haiyan said the slaughter began while she and a friend were standing in the ticket hall of the train station. ""Suddenly, many people started running around crazily,"" she said on Tencent Weibo, a Chinese equivalent of Twitter. ""We saw two people carrying big cleavers hacking whoever is in the way. They almost got to my back. Then I lost contact with (my friend) and I saw blood splashing in front of me."" As is common in the aftermath of attacks, the casualty figures were in flux: in the same story, Xinhua reported that at least 28 civilians had been killed and 113 wounded and that 29 were confirmed dead and more than 130 wounded. Members of a separatist group from Xinjiang, in northwest China, are believed to have carried out the assault, authorities said. The report referred to them as terrorists. Police said that, in addition to killing at least four attackers, they had shot and wounded a female suspect. Train departures were not affected, Xinhua reported, citing the railway bureau. In the aftermath, postings on Sina Weibo, another Twitter-like social medium, showed local police patrolling the station, where bodies lay on the ground in blood. Chinese state TV showed investigators placing a knife -- its blade at least 2 feet long -- into an evidence bag. Mass knife attacks are not unprecedented in China. Some occurred in 2010 and 2012, but the attacks happened at schools and didn't appear to have political connections. Chinese President Xi Jinping urged law enforcement ""to investigate and solve the case and punish the terrorists in accordance with the law,"" according to Xinhua. Kunming's railway station is one of the largest in southwest China. Two weeks ago, 11 ""terrorists"" died in the Xinjiang region, Xinhua reported. Frequent outbreaks of violence have beset Xinjiang, a resource-rich area where the arrival of waves of Han Chinese people over the decades has fueled tensions with the Uyghurs, a Turkic-speaking, predominantly Muslim ethnic group.","""We saw two people carrying big cleavers hacking whoever is in the way,"" witness says .

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration told the manufacturers of seven caffeinated alcoholic beverages Wednesday that their drinks are a ""public health concern"" and can't stay on the market in their current form. The move follows a year-long review by the FDA, which gave the companies 15 days to either reformulate their products or face possible seizure under federal law, said Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, the agency's principal deputy commissioner. Experts have said the caffeine used in the beverages can mask the effects of alcohol, leaving drinkers unaware of how intoxicated they are. ""FDA does not find support for the claim that the addition of caffeine to these alcoholic beverages is 'generally recognized as safe,' which is the legal standard,"" Sharfstein told reporters. ""To the contrary, there is evidence that the combinations of caffeine and alcohol in these products pose a public health concern."" One of the companies that received warning letters was Phusion Projects, of Chicago, Illinois, which makes Four Loko -- a drink nicknamed ""blackout in a can"" by some users. The company announced Tuesday that it was dropping caffeine and two other ingredients, guarana and taurine, from Four Loko in the face of ""a difficult and politically-charged regulatory environment."" The other companies are San Diego, California-based United Brands, which manufactures the Joose and Max brands; Portland, Oregon's Charge Beverages Corp., which sells Core High Gravity HG, Core High Gravity HG Orange, and Lemon Lime Core Spiked; and New Century Brewing of Boston, Massachusetts, which makes Moonshot. Sharfstein called Phusion's decision to drop caffeine and two other ingredients a ""positive step"" Wednesday. And in a statement issued after the decision, the company said it was pleased by FDA's response. ""As we stated yesterday, we have stopped the production and shipment of all our products containing these ingredients,"" the company said. ""We will continue to work closely and cooperatively with national and state regulators."" But New Century proprietor Rhonda Kallman told CNN she was puzzled by the FDA's decision to include Moonshot on its list. ""I don't know what to say except I'm really shocked about the outcome of the FDA's inquiry, and I need more answers than what I've gotten,"" said Kallman, who said she is New Century's only full-time employee. Kallman described Moonshot as a craft beer that has about 4 percent alcohol by weight, about two-thirds the caffeine of a cup of coffee and is sold in only three cities -- ""and yet it's being singled out with Four Loko and Joose."" ""Those brands are neon green. They're not beer, they're juice, with 200 grams of sodium and artificial everything,"" she said. United Brands said Tuesday that it would review any new FDA guidelines, but noted it was unaware ""of a single incident of injury or other harm associated with its products."" Neither United nor Charge Beverages had responded to requests for comment after the announcement. The FDA has no authority to ban the products outright. But Sharfstein said the review is still going on, and ""We expect these warning letters to be read across the industry."" ""This will send a message to the industry about the importance of looking directly at these alcoholic beverages and how the FDA will respond to that,"" he said. The FDA began its review in November 2009, after complaints from officials in several states. The controversy exploded in October, when nine underage students at Central Washington University were hospitalized after drinking Four Loko, both on its own and mixed with other drinks, police reported. Critics say drinks like Four Loko mix caffeine equal to the amount in three cups of coffee with the alcoholic equivalent of three cans of beer and are designed to appeal to younger consumers accustomed to consuming high-caffeine energy drinks. A 23.5-ounce can of Four Loko contains either 6 or 12 percent alcohol by volume, depending on state regulations. Phusion has compared Four Loko to popular drinks like rum and cola or Irish coffee that also mix caffeine and alcohol. But ""we didn't see these kinds of events when people were drinking irish coffees,"" Robert McKenna, Washington's state attorney general, told reporters. ""What we're seeing now is striking, and we need to take quick action,"" McKenna said. Washington and four other states -- New York, Utah, Michigan and Oklahoma -- already have taken steps to remove Four Loko and similar drinks from store shelves. And Gil Kerlikowske, the White House anti-drug czar, praised the FDA for moving against products he said are ""designed, branded, and promoted to encourage binge drinking."" ""Acting early to protect public health is critical and a vital component of the Obama administration's effort to reduce drug use and its consequences,"" he said. Combining large amounts of caffeine and alcohol produces ""a wide-awake drunk,"" said Dr. Mary Claire O'Brien, an associate professor of emergency medicine at Wake Forest University's medical school in North Carolina. But since caffeine's effect wears off faster than alcohol's, she said, drinkers are left with ""much more alcohol than he would have been able to tolerate -- and that leads to blackouts."" ""If you're going to drink caffeine, drink it responsibly. If you're going to drink alcohol, drink it responsibly,"" said O'Brien, who has studied the drinks extensively. ""But mixing them is dangerous, because you might not know when you've had too much to drink.""

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday that the salmonella outbreak that sickened about1,400 people across the country appears to be over. Contaminated jalapeño and serrano peppers, grown in Mexico, are no longer in circulation, the FDA said. ""The number of reported cases has been dropping since early July,"" and the number has appeared to return to around the typical number of salmonella cases expected during this time of year, said Dr. Robert Tauxe, the deputy director of the CDC Division of Foodborne, Bacterial and Mycotic Diseases. ""There are some cases of this infection that occur every year,"" he said. Initial results from a CDC and Food and Drug Administration investigation found that jalapeño peppers appeared to be a major carrier of the bacteria, as were serrano peppers, Tauxe said. Tomatoes -- identified early in the outbreak as the culprit -- were still possibly a source, he said. The FDA said the contaminated jalapeño and serrano peppers, grown in Mexico, were no longer in circulation and said Thursday that it was lifting its advice to avoid eating raw jalapeño and serrano peppers grown, harvested or packed in Mexico. The agency had lifted its advice to consumers last month to avoid several types of tomatoes. At least 286 people were hospitalized from the salmonella Saintpaul strain, which began in April, and it may have contributed to two deaths, Tauxe said. ""Most persons became ill in May, June and early July,"" he said. The outbreak touched 43 states as well as Washington and Canada, Tauxe explained. ""This was a very large and complex outbreak,"" he said, noting that it was unusual to have two food carriers with the bacteria. It was the largest  foodborne outbreak -- based on confirmed cases -- in the last 10 years, the CDC said. Investigators had traced a contaminated jalapeno pepper found in a Texas produce distribution firm to a farm in Tamaulipas, Mexico. They found contaminated serrano peppers and irrigation systems at another farm in that same region. However, Dr. David Acheson of the FDA said they were not prepared to rule out the possibility that there were other sources. ""If you've got salmonella Saintpaul in a water supply on a farm, you've got to ask the question about how it got into the water, whether it was connected to canal systems -- the irrigation systems could have caused that contamination to go elsewhere,"" he said.","Salmonella cases have been dropping since early July, CDC says .

"In his first-ever interview as the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani defended his country against allegations of funding terrorism and pledged support for the fight against ISIS for the long haul. ""We don't fund extremists,"" the Emir told CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Thursday. ""If you talk about certain movements, especially in Syria and Iraq, we all consider them terrorist movement."" ""I know that in America and some countries they look at some movements as terrorist movements. ...  But there are differences. There are differences that some countries and some people that any group which comes from Islamic background are terrorists. And we don't accept that."" It would be a ""big mistake,"" he said, to consider every Islamic movement to be ""extremists."" The Qatari government itself has long been criticized for hosting and financing Islamic extremists in Syria and elsewhere; an Israeli diplomat has even gone so far as to call the country, ""Club Med for terrorists."" Nonetheless, the small, but rich Gulf nation has become a key member of the U.S-led effort to route ISIS in Syria. The country hosts one of the largest American military bases in the Middle East. Qatar, like other coalition countries, will ""stay in it for a while,"" the Emir, 34, told Amanpour. ""We've been asked by our American friends if we can join, and we did."" Who is the enemy? There are some crucial differences in Qatar's approach to the chaos in Syria, and America's. The Obama administration has said explicitly that while Bashar al-Assad, Syria's brutal strongman, has lost all legitimacy, he is no longer a priority. Qatar could not disagree more. ""The main cause of all this is the regime in Syria, and this regime should be punished,"" the Emir said. ""We've been saying that from day one, that if we don't stop the bloodshed in Syria and we don't stop Bashar committing genocide on his own people, this is where we're going to reach."" ""Unfortunately, we are in a situation now that the Syrian people, who demanded for their freedom, are between a regime, brutal regime, and terrorist acts."" ""If we think that we're going to get rid of the terrorist movements and leave those regimes doing what -- this regime especially, doing what he is doing -- then terrorist movements will come back again."" America has now done what President Barack Obama so long wanted to avoid -- intervention in the Syrian war. But it remains very unlikely that he would expand the mission to combat the Assad regime. Would Qatar, Amanpour asked, expand its mission in Syria to do after the regime? ""Qatar cannot do that by itself, of course. If there is a coalition that will help and protect the Syrian people, we will be part of it."" A troubled region . Qatar's relationship with Syria, of course, is from the only the only source of controversy in its foreign policy. During the Arab Spring, many accused Qatar of backing the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and the Qatari-run cable news network Al Jazeera of instigating unrest around the Middle East. The Emir contended that far from playing sides, Qatar backed every Egyptian government since Hosni Mubarak stepped down. He did acknowledge that many members of the Muslim Brotherhood, who have fled Egypt en masse, have been offered shelter in Qatar. ""Many of them left and some of them came to Qatar because they were traveling and they were afraid."" ""Some of them are still there,"" he said. ""They know the rules of the country -- that as long as you're here, you can't practice politics against any other Arab country."" Qatar is also a vocal supporter of Hamas, the Palestinian organization, which controls Gaza and which the United States considers a terrorist organization. Amanpour asked whether Qatar would continue its support of Hamas. ""We support all Palestinian people. We believe Hamas is a very important part of the Palestinian people."" ""What is the difference between Hamas 10 years ago and Hamas now? I believe the difference is that Hamas are more realistic now. They believe in peace and they want peace. But it's for the other party to believe in peace as well and to be more realistic."" A troubled World Cup . Nothing shows Qatar's desire to have its moment in the sun better than its successful bid to host the World Cup in 2022. It would be the first Muslim country to do so. The bid has been mired in controversy, amid allegations of bribery and horrific labor conditions for those building the stadiums and infrastructure. Qatar's scorching summer weather has also been a source of considerable tension; some have suggested that the tournament should be moved to the winter, though that would wreak havoc on soccer league schedules around the world. ""People should understand that Qatar had the best bid, and Qatar will provide and will do one of the best World Cups in history,"" the Emir said. ""And I'm sure about that."" ""People don't want to accept, don't want to realize that a small country, Arab, Muslim country, can host a big event like that."" The International Trade Union Confederation says that well over 1,000 migrant workers have died in Qatar since construction began, and 4,000 could be dead by the time the World Cup starts. ""Yes, it's true -- we had problems,"" the Emir said. ""We're solving the problems. We're enforcing the laws -- it's not acceptable."" ""We changed the laws. They are enforced and there are many laws that have been changed. And I'm telling you because I am personally hurt about the situation."" When asked by Amanpour, the Emir said that the laws would ""definitely"" be enforced, and workers would ""definitely"" get paid their fair wage. ""All the media is concentrating on Qatar due to the World Cup,"" he said. ""If we have problems I don't mind the talking about problems. But also we need to talk other -- about other things, about those laws that we did."" In order protect players from the heat of Qatar's summer, the country is development complex air conditioning systems for its stadiums. ""We have this technology for ten years now and it's working in ... one of our stadiums."" ""One hundred percent it will be working"" for the 2002 Cup, he said. And what of the suggestion that the Cup be moved to winter? ""Our bid was for it to be in summer,"" he said. ""At the end, it's up to the FIFA to decide when is the best time."" ""We're ready for both.""","World makes too many generalizations about Islamic movements, he says .

"T-shirts, hoodies and even toy figurines bearing the ISIS logo are being sold on online and marketed across social media. For around $10 you can buy an ISIS shirt with the militant group's logo and phrases printed on it like ""We are all ISIS"" and ""Fight for Freedom, Until the Last Drop of Blood."" A toy soldier available on Rezji.com, an Indonesian site which by Tuesday could not be accessed, holds a gun in its hands and an ISIS flag with the Islamic tenet: ""There is no god but God, Muhammad is the messenger of God."" The websites are marketing the ISIS paraphernalia across social media. Facebook has been removing the pages once the media alerts them to their existence. ""Where hateful content is posted and reported, Facebook removes it and disables accounts of those responsible,"" a Facebook spokesperson told CNN via email. CNN alerted Twitter to some of the merchants' pages on that social network, but Twitter declined to comment. Using merchandise to market itself as ""cool"" is a one of the common propaganda tools ISIS uses, according to researcher Hassan Hassan of the Delma Institute in Dubai. ""The point is to encourage people to get out there and join the trend,"" Hassan said. Many of the websites with the merchandise come from Indonesia. While Middle East experts are unsure whether ISIS is manufacturing the products, terrorism researcher J.M. Berger says he wouldn't be surprised if the money ends up going to ISIS. ""ISIS has a big base of support in Southeast Asia -- a long history with Islamism and jihadism. A number of foreign fighters come from the region,"" Berger wrote in an email to CNN. ""Much radical activity is local: vigilante gangs and mainstream politics. For those who find those options lacking, ISIS seems to be the leading choice of outlet."" While some of the Indonesian manufacturers of the ISIS merchandise may be opportunistic capitalists, others may be sympathetic to ISIS. On the Twitter feed of the Rezji manufacturers, they describe themselves in the Indonesian language as ""distributors of anti-Western culture"" and state ""together we stand with you against the tyrants."" In early 2014, the Institute for the Policy and Analysis of Conflict (IPAC) published a report that said the Syrian conflict was attracting foreign fighters from Indonesia. ""Indonesian extremists are more engaged by the conflict in Syria than by any other foreign war in recent memory, including Afghanistan and Iraq,"" the report said.

"Atlanta (CNN) -- You've probably seen the smoke-filled, glass-encased fishbowls that play host to smokers if you've passed through some of the nation's largest airports in recent years. Perhaps you've cast a quick glance in its direction as you walked by, feeling contempt or maybe even a dash of pity for those poor slaves to a nasty habit. But if you're a smoker with a mind to enter the fishbowl -- and many shudder at the thought -- you're likely grateful for the consideration as you puff away, contributing to the collective cloud enveloping you. ""Isn't this nice?"" traveler Colleen Sherretta said of the concourse C smoking lounge at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, as others cycled through the sliding automatic door, filling the room to capacity. A cool draft circulated musty air around the lounge, whose walls were unadorned except for a hole into which you could insert your cigarette for a light; and a large window providing a view of the busy tarmac and a generous amount of natural light. Smoking lounges can be comforting to a group of people accustomed to being pushed to the fringes. If there's one thing strangers in airport smoking lounges like to talk about, apart from tobacco price comparisons, it's the fact that they're in an airport smoking lounge. ""I'm glad they have one,"" Sherretta said cheerily during a recent midday connection from Savannah, Georgia, to Newark, New Jersey, as she stubbed out her Camel Blue. ""They don't have these in Newark."" It's true, smoking is not allowed anywhere inside the airports operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, including Newark International. Twenty-two of the nation's 29 large-hub international airports are completely smoke-free inside the terminal, according to a Centers for Disease Control report released in November 2010. The number of smoking lounges has decreased since 2002, when less than half of the nation's large-hub airports were smoke-free. But the 2010 report means that seven of the nation's largest airports -- including the five busiest -- still allow smoking inside the terminals, as do several other smaller airports. There are websites and travel forums devoted to the topic. As long as smoking is legal in the United States, smoking lounges will continue to represent the tension between those who detest the addictive habit and those who can't quite rid themselves of it. ""As we're learning more about the tremendous dangers of smoking, fewer people are willing to tolerate exposure to second-hand smoke, which leads to smokers being pushed to the periphery,"" said licensed psychologist Clifford Lazarus. ""But it is a right, people can smoke just like they can drink and have guns, it's just that the government is being a bit more controlling in terms of creating parameters in which people can engage in this marginalized behavior."" Public smoking policies tend to reflect the attitudes of the community, which means the fate of airport smoking lounges increasingly rests in the hands of their hometowns' lawmakers. ""Airports are creatures of the community,"" said Debby McElroy with Airports Council International. ""The decision as to whether to provide a smoking lounge in the terminal is based on the laws and regulations of that jurisdiction as well as the desires of the community."" Allegations that airport smoking policies are influenced by the tobacco lobby are not always untrue. The construction of Atlanta's smoking lounges was funded by Philip Morris, according to documents on the University of California's online Legacy Tobacco Documents Library. Smoking is not allowed in airports in New York and New Jersey, two of 25 states where smoking is banned in workplaces, restaurants and bars, compared to Georgia, where smoking laws vary from city to county. The same goes for regulations related to ventilation of designated smoking areas. ""We have four indoor smoking areas. Two designated smoking lounges and two restaurants that offer separate smoking areas,"" said Laura Cole, spokeswoman for Denver International Airport in Colorado. ""All four are fully enclosed and DIA uses completely separate ventilated systems for the smoking areas. We believe that by using separate systems to ventilate the smoking lounges and the concourse we're creating a second layer of protection from second-hand smoke."" But ventilation systems do not eliminate the hazards of second-hand smoke, a 2006 Surgeon General's report found, leading public health advocacy groups to support a zero tolerance policy. ""We're optimistic that the trend is still going toward 100% smoke free, like the airlines. The question is who will be the last?"" said Cynthia Hallet, executive director of Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights, a California-based lobbying group. ""The bottom line is this is a health issue. We know what smoking and second-hand smoke can do to us, and the safest policy is a smoke-free policy."" Hallet said she would like to ""see some leadership"" on the issue from the nation's busiest airport. Instead, Atlanta's airport takes the lead in the number of airport smoking lounges, 11 spread out over 6 concourses, in the name of customer service. ""Hartsfield-Jackson provides designated, specially designed smoking lounges on each concourse for the convenience and comfort of our passengers who choose to smoke,"" airport spokesman John Kennedy said in an e-mail. ""The Airport's layout and design does not allow for outside smoking areas in the sterile concourses and the smoking lounges eliminate the need for passengers wishing to smoke to exit and then re-enter the secured areas, or seek other alternatives to smoke inside the Airport."" His comments were echoed by spokespeople from the six other airports with designated smoking areas beyond security (Denver International, Dallas-Fort Worth International, Las Vegas' McCarren International, Charlotte-Douglas International, Washington Dulles International and Salt Lake City International). Each said smoking lounges reduce incidents of people sneaking a puff in restricted areas, especially connecting passengers who don't have the time to leave the building and go through security. Passengers who smoke agree. ""It's a necessity for people who have long layovers,"" a patron of Atlanta's concourse B smoking lounge said in between long drags of a Marlboro Red from a tar-stained plastic cigarette holder. ""I don't think they'll ever go away."" The 60-year-old lifelong smoker from West Palm Beach, Florida, had a few hours to spare until his flight to Minneapolis, Minnesota, where smoking is also banned in bars, restaurants, workplaces and the airport. He was happy to wait among fellow smokers -- businessmen on their phones, soldiers discussing past and future deployments, chatty couples and the odd single woman fixing their makeup and reading celebrity gossip magazines. ""I love to people watch in here. You have all walks of life coming in here. Even though it's not accepted by a majority of the public you see all walks of life in here. I also love to listen to the soldiers' conversations. They really impress me. They're so clean cut. I'm surprised they smoke,"" he said. Nonsmokers, however, think the era of the smoking lounge is nearing its end. ""It's just disgusting. I can smell the smoke even though those doors are closed,"" traveler Cathy Urchin said as she waited in line at Seattle's Best Coffee, across from the smoking lounge. ""I used to smoke. Now I'm just glad I live in Minnesota, where you can't smoke in bars or the airport,"" she said. ""I think they're becoming extinct. Or at least I hope they are.""","7 of nation's 29 large-hub airports allow smoking in designated areas in terminals .

"French hostage Herve Gourdel was abducted and beheaded, a killing shown on video, French President Francois Hollande told the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday. ""You will understand that today I am speaking before you with a particularly high level of emotion because one of my compatriots has just been subject of a cowardly assassination,"" Hollande said. ""He was a man who was full enthusiasm. He loved the mountains. He thought he would be able to pursue his passion moving into the Ouzou area in Algeria."" Hollande said the attack won't affect France's role in the battle against terrorism. ""France will never give in to blackmail, to pressure, to barbaric acts.  Quite to the contrary, France knows what is expected,"" Hollande said. Earlier, Hollande expressed his condolences to Gourdel's family in a news conference at the French mission. Gourdel was kidnapped over the weekend in Algeria's Tizi Ouzou region east of Algiers, the French Foreign Ministry said. The video was posted online Wednesday. It shows armed men who claim to belong to Islamist militant group Jund al-Khilafa -- or Soldiers of the Caliphate -- in Algeria. They pledge allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. ISIS execution videos strikingly similar . Titled ""A message of blood for the French government,"" the video surfaced as French Prime Minister Manuel Valls addressed the French National Assembly, the country's lower house of parliament, about the fight against ISIS. France is part of a broad coalition that is working with the United States to combat the brutal extremist group. According to his website, Gourdel was born in 1959 and when he was a teenager decided he wanted to become a mountain guide. He opened a guide office in Saint Martin-Vésubie in 1987 where he spent more than 20 years, the website says. He was also an active member of a mountaineering club that spent time in France's Mercantour National Park. The Algerian government called the beheading an act of ""criminals."" ""It is with a lot of sorrow and sadness that the Algerian government has learned about the horrible assassination of French national Pierre Hervé Gourdel, an odious and despicable act committed by a group of criminals,"" officials said, according to the state-run Algerie Presse Service news agency. Hollande said he spoke with Algerian Prime Minister Abdelmalek Sellal, who assured Hollande he would commit a maximum effort to find the killers and Gourdel's body. ""We owe it to his family,"" Hollande said. The video appears to show the latest beheading of a Westerner by an Islamist extremist group. Since mid-August, ISIS has beheaded American journalists Steven Sotloff and James Foley and British aid worker David Haines. The new video came on the same day U.S. President Barack Obama addressed the United Nations, calling for all countries to unite against terrorism and brutality wrought by ISIS. The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria goes against everything Islam stands for, he said. Islam, Obama said, is about peace. Obama publicly extended the condolences of the United States to the people of France for the death of Gourdel. The U.N.

"Marbella, Spain (CNN) -- U.S. first lady Michelle Obama and her youngest daughter, Sasha, 9, arrived Wednesday on Spain's southern Mediterranean coast for a vacation with friends at a luxury hotel here. The White House issued a brief statement Tuesday confirming only that ""the first lady will travel to Spain for a private, mother-daughter trip with longtime family friends. President Obama will not be joining this trip. All activities are closed press."" While the Spanish government also was not providing details, the hotel owners and just about every local politician in the resort of Marbella, famous for its jet-set image, were discussing the visit that is making front-page news in some Spanish newspapers. ""We are really amazed about her choosing our hotel and coming down to the south of Spain, paying us such a wonderful visit at the best time of the year,"" said Alicia Villapadierna, co-owner of the Hotel Villa Padierna, where Obama and her entourage are staying. An aide to Mrs. Obama and Villapadierna confirmed that the first lady was traveling with Sasha. The aide said daughter Malia, 12, is away at camp. Security was already tight at the hotel on Tuesday. Numerous Spanish Civil Guards patrolled the various access points to the resort, and a large American flag flapped in the wind alongside a Spanish flag at the entrance. Out of sight, Villapadierna said, were numerous U.S. Secret Service agents. Her husband, hotel co-owner Ricardo Arranz, said Obama apparently chose the hotel on the recommendation of friends who had visited before. The hotel is in the hills above the resort town of Marbella, a haunt for the rich and famous, including members of the royal family of Saudi Arabia, Spain's so-called jet-set and Hollywood actors such as Sean Connery and Antonio Banderas. Northern Europeans, especially from Britain and Germany, far outnumber the Americans who visit in August, when the beaches are packed. The Obama group is expected to occupy 60 to 70 rooms, more than a third of the lodging at the 160-room resort, which consists of hotel rooms, suites and separate villas. Listed prices start at 300 euros, or nearly $400 per night at the resort, which uses Italian marble as a decorative theme. The facility includes golf courses, tennis courts, a swimming pool and spa and a range of activities for children, such as sports and performing arts. Sasha ""will be surrounded by children, and I'm sure that Mrs. Obama will be able to do her life and enjoy the spa and the swimming pool,"" Villapadierna said. The White House statement said Obama would visit Spain's King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia, who typically vacation in August at their summer palace on Mallorca Island in the Mediterranean, a short flight from Marbella on the southern Costa del Sol (sun coast) of Spain. Spanish media reported the visit with the Spanish royals could come this weekend. Before then, many people in old town Marbella -- with its winding narrow streets and white-washed walls, and in nearby chic Puerto Banus, where large yachts are moored -- were hoping Obama would come for a visit. ""I suppose [she] likes the Spanish food,"" said Karla de la Barra, maitre d' at the Salsa Marinera restaurant in Puerto Banus. ""For example, seafood paella. And Spain fish is very good."" At the nearby Luz jewelry store, owner Kai Baumann said, ""I think porcelain is very nice. I think she likes this style of things. And I would make a photo, of course. I would be very happy. She's a very nice lady."" But on this private vacation under tight security, it's not likely many local people will get a chance to see Michelle Obama up close.","The first lady and her youngest daughter arrived in Spain Wednesday .

"Editor's Note: The staff at CNN.com has recently been intrigued by the journalism of VICE, an independent media company and Web site based in Brooklyn, New York. VBS.TV is VICE's broadband television network. The reports, which are produced solely by VICE, reflect a very transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers. Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- On the afternoon of June 13, 1981, a Japanese man named Issei Sagawa walked to the Bois de Boulogne, a park on the outskirts of Paris, carrying two suitcases. The contents of those suitcases were the dismembered body parts of a fellow student, a Dutch woman named Renée Hartevelt, whom Sagawa had shot three days prior and had spent the days since, eating various parts of her body. The details of Sagawa's brief incarceration and subsequent return to Japan are too vague and complex to state here, but for the sake of this introduction, I can say that on August 12, 1986, Sagawa checked himself out of Matsuzawa Psychiatric Hospital and has been a free man ever since. This is the point in the story in which things get really strange. In his 24 years of freedom since, Sagawa has experienced a level of notoriety ranging from perverse public intrigue to minor celebrity. He has published novels; inspired songs; been the subject of countless documentaries and magazine articles, and exploitation films in which he re-enacts his crime; drawn manga novels and even directed his own personal pornography ""experiment."" Effectively, he has made a living off his crime. The prospect of not only meeting such a despicable man but spending several days with him was of course one of apprehension. A walk through his greater Tokyo apartment revealed an almost physical manifestation of his neurosis. Just inside the door, a wall-mounted black balaclava hangs next to cabinets filled with gargoyle-like statuettes, classic literature and trinkets collected over decades of travels (often with young girls he's met under dubious circumstances). Chairs are piled high with stuffed children's toys. His room is like a 14-year-old boy's: adorned with countless images of young girls, some painted by himself, some taken from celebrity magazines. See the rest of Issei Sagawa's story at VBS.TV . After an initial meeting, we went to a local restaurant for lunch, over which Sagawa recommended we visit the national park around Mount Fuji. ""Breathtaking scenery,"" he assured us, ""and there is a part of the forest where people go to commit suicide called Aokigahara. If I could drive, I would go there and kill myself,"" he remarked casually. I explained that, funnily enough, we had been there a few days prior, shooting a documentary surrounding the park, and actually the train was modestly priced. We returned to his tiny apartment and began the interview. Sagawa stared into the lens of the camera and began his story. Clearly, at times his delivery was scripted and straight from the pages of his novels. It was an abject despair at having to once again recount what he refers to as his ""incident."" He was constantly desperate to somehow validate his existence, and what unfolded was a confession of a man approaching the end of a very unusual life and having spent too much time reflecting upon it. Sagawa's punishment, he believes, is the very thing that has supported him -- his fame and the irony is not lost on him. Personally, I feel that this torment has not been punishment enough. Furthermore, I feel that perhaps the blame is just as much upon us, the public. We have been encouraging this strange man to exist in order to feed our macabre fascinations, and the irony of that is not lost on me.","Issei Sagawa murdered a Dutch woman in 1981, dismembered and ate her .

"From his sanctuary in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, with roughly a dozen police officers outside, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said Saturday that everyone in the world will be just as effectively monitored soon -- at least digitally. ""The ability to surveil everyone on the planet is almost there and, arguably, will be there in the next couple of years,"" said Assange, speaking via Skype to a large audience at the South by Southwest Interactive festival here. Assange rocketed to international fame, and infamy, in 2010 after Wikileaks began helping publish secret government documents online. Ecuador granted Assange asylum in June 2012 and he fled to the embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he is wanted for questioning over allegations that he raped one woman and sexually molested another. He calls those charges false and politically motivated, but has said he fears Sweden will transfer him to the United States, where he could face the death penalty for the work of WikiLeaks if he were charged and convicted of a crime. On Saturday, he called life in the embassy ""like a prison,"" adding that actual inmates ""arguably"" have it worse. Saturday's talk was billed as a question-and-answer session, but because of technological glitches it ended up being mostly an hourlong speech by Assange, punctuated occasionally with questions from Twitter. The one-sided conversation seemed to turn off some members of the 2,000 people in the audience, many of whom streamed out before Assange was finished speaking. With little to guide him other than his own thoughts (moderator Benjamin Palmer's audio connection appeared to go down after about 15 minutes), Assange was largely left to expound upon his views that world powers like the United States and England have overstepped their bounds in terms of online surveillance. He said the U.S. National Security Agency has become a ""rogue agency"" with too much power, even suggesting that President Barack Obama would be toppled politically if he attempted to disband the agency. ""They would come up with all of this dirt (on Obama),"" he said. ""Congress may impeach him ... a criminal act would come to light."" Assange described activist groups like WikiLeaks as freedom fighters in an age when governments have occupied what should be their citizens' private online space. ""Now that the Internet has merged with human society, the laws of human society should apply to the Internet,"" he said. He said that because governments keep so much information secret, citizens don't have a complete picture of what is happening .

"The recent video depicting the final words and beheading of U.S. journalist James Wright Foley by someone that seems to be a British foreign fighter has sent shockwaves across the West. The video has already been blocked multiple times from various video-sharing platforms, only to reappear as many times, something that once again emphasizes that the new frontline for counter-terrorist practitioners is online extremism. Labeled as a ""Message to America,"" the video adds another line of fodder to ISIS' tech-savvy and social media-driven propaganda and messaging. The scene is filmed on a high quality device with seamless editing of President Obama's speech authorizing military action against ISIS positions, something which it argues led directly to this, ISIS' brutal response. The answer to why ISIS -- which refers to itself as the ""Islamic State"" (""IS"") -- makes and popularizes such videos is simple: They represent a critical threat to the West on two levels. On the one hand, the video directly warns the West of repercussions if its intervention continues. On the other, it represents a more subtle threat reminding Europe and the United States that their own citizens are vulnerable to being radicalized, that ISIS supporters are present all over the world. In the past, most ISIS propaganda had focused on the development of the caliphate state and on securing territories within Syria and Iraq. The primary target audience had been Syrian and Iraqi military forces and militias. So, creating an elaborate display of beheading an American represents a distinct change in messaging, turning the threat towards the West. The act is declared as revenge for U.S. air strikes against ISIS fighters in Iraq. Indeed, the apparently British militant conducting the beheading addresses Obama directly, declaring that any attempt ""to deny Muslims liberty and safety under the Islamic caliphate will result in the bloodshed of your people."" Clearly, here ISIS is attempting to strip U.S. intervention down to the rudimentary ""us versus them rhetoric"" -- depicting the West, and specifically America, as a force that is continually trying to oppress Muslims the world over. This is nothing new. In the ISIS English-language magazine, ""Dabiq,"" Westerners are referred to as ""Crusaders,"" linking present day events with historical events where Christians (predominantly, but not exclusively, from the West) have targeted Muslims. As such, the U.S. decision to commence military action in Iraq based on humanitarian concerns, without the equivalent military intervention of other Middle Eastern political powers has played into ISIS rhetoric against America. ISIS knows that U.S. military action is unlikely to change based on one video. However, by making this threat and demanding that the U.S. stop military interference in the region, ISIS gives itself justification for direct action against American hostages and potentially justifies action against the U.S. directly. Opinion: Beheading video poses challenge for social media . Using an apparently British foreign fighter to carry out the beheading in the Foley execution video was a deliberate act perpetrated in order to create the maximum impact and gain as much Western attention as possible. The use of what seems to be a native English-speaker in the video forces Western viewers to recognize an individual who has wholeheartedly rejected his past, and who is committed to ISIS' cause -- willing to carry out the most abhorrent acts of violence in the name of its political program. Western governments face an ongoing threat that their citizens will become radicalized and go abroad to fight in Syria and Iraq. Aaron Zelin, a fellow at the Washington Center for Near East Policy, estimates that almost 3,000 foreign fighters have left Western countries to fight in Syria. This is an unprecedented number, already far surpassing the number that left to fight in Afghanistan during the previous 10-year conflict. The success of ISIS in promoting their cause and attracting fighters from abroad is a combination of an advanced social media strategy paired with a lack of counter-narratives. While ISIS supporters handing out leaflets on London streets may gain more media attention, it is ISIS' online presence that is its most powerful recruitment tool. ISIS has been a game-changer in terms of using Twitter, YouTube and its own online apps to engage with potential recruits, promote its victories and antagonize its perceived enemies. Twitter feeds regularly depict an idealized image of a 5-star jihad to draw in young potential jihadists, often mentioning the availability of young local women who are marrying ISIS fighters. These same feeds also boast of ""spoils"" -- military weaponry and vehicles won in battle. Violence towards the enemy is also a common theme, largely because it threatens those willing to stand up to ISIS, something that cultivates intrinsic fear in future military and paramilitary personnel attempting to face the group. Right now, we are woefully lacking in both online and offline content that stands up against ISIS messaging. Counter-messaging needs to come from moderate theologians explaining why Islam does not condone the use of violence. Other community voices must be louder in their arguments against the validity of a caliphate state. Finally, governments must give a clear message about why they are intervening militarily in some areas, like Iraq, but unwilling to act in others, like Syria. The extremist minority is exceptionally vocal and continues to overwhelm discourse on the validity of ISIS and its actions, particularly online. Only by empowering and activating the vast moderate majority can we turn the tide against ISIS.

"More than a century before Johnny Depp wore a terrifying crow headpiece in new Disney film ""The Lone Ranger,"" another hero of the Wild West was carefully arranging his own remarkable disguise. Sometimes he dressed as a preacher, at other times a tramp, and occasionally even a woman. But beneath the elaborate costumes was always Bass Reeves -- a 19th-century Arkansas slave who became a legendary deputy U.S. marshal, capturing more than 3,000 criminals with his flamboyant detective skills, super strength and supreme horsemanship. 'Texas in Queens': The story of New York City's black cowboys . Sound familiar? As one historian argues, Reeves could have been the real-life inspiration behind one of America's most beloved fictional characters -- the Lone Ranger. ""Many of Reeves' personal attributes and techniques in catching desperadoes were similar to the Lone Ranger,"" says Art Burton, author of ""Black Gun, Silver Star: The Life and Legend of Frontier Marshal Bass Reeves."" ""He was bigger than the Lone Ranger -- he was a combination of the Lone Ranger, Sherlock Holmes and Superman,"" Burton told CNN. ""But because he was a black man his story has been buried. He never got the recognition he deserved."" Legendary Lone Ranger . It's a world apart from the fictional Lone Ranger, who remains one of most the iconic Wild West heroes of the 20th century. First appearing on a Detroit radio station in 1933, the masked man on a white stallion who brought bad guys to justice was hugely successful, with the series running for over two decades. It spawned novels, comic books and an eight-year TV show starring the most iconic Lone Ranger of all -- actor Clayton Moore. Indeed, Disney's new film -- featuring Armie Hammer as the Lone Ranger and Johnny Depp as his trusty native American Indian sidekick Tonto -- is just the latest in a long line of films depicting the legendary lawman. So what's that got to do with Bass Reeves -- one of the country's first African American marshals, who was born almost 100 years before the Lone Ranger made his radio debut? Hi-Ho Silver! Quite a lot, argues Burton, pointing to similarities such as their gray horses, penchant for disguises, use of American Indian trackers, and unusual calling cards -- Reeves gave folks a silver dollar to remember him by, while the Lone Ranger left silver bullets. As for the iconic black mask, the link is more symbolic. ""Blacks at that time wore an invisible mask in a world that largely ignored them -- so in that societal sense, Reeves also wore a mask,"" said Burton, a lecturer at South Suburban College in Illinois. ""When the Lone Ranger first started appearing in comic books he wore a black mask that covered his entire face. Why would they do that? There was deep physiological connection going on."" Then there's the Detroit link. Many of the thousands of criminals captured by Reeves were sent to the House of Corrections in Detroit  -- the same city where the Lone Ranger character was created by George Trendle and Fran Striker. ""It's not beyond belief that all those felons were talking about a black man who had these attributes and the stories got out,"" said Burton. ""I haven't been able to prove conclusively that Reeves was the inspiration for the Lone Ranger, but he was the closest person in real life who had these characteristics."" Real life superhero . In fact, if the newspaper clippings, federal documents, and handed-down stories are anything to go by, Reeves wasn't just a lawman -- he was a 6 foot 2 inch moustachioed muscleman who was so honorable he even arrested his own son. Born a slave in Arkansas in 1838, Reeves headed to the Civil War front line in the 1860s, working as a servant for his master in the Confederate Army. While there, he managed to escape to the Indian Territory -- now the state of Oklahoma -- living with native American Indians and learning their languages and tracking skills. So renowned were the father-of-10's shooting skills and horsemanship, that in 1875 he was appointed deputy U.S. marshal. ""He was a big guy for his time,"" said Burton. ""If you got in a fight with Reeves it was the worst decision you could make in your life -- it accounted to suicide. ""He was also an excellent horseman -- the Indians taught him how to make himself appear smaller in the saddle, helping him with disguises."" Such was the skilled rider's love of horses, he even bred them on his farm. Indeed, many of the first U.S. jockeys were African American slaves who had originally worked in their master's stables. Lost legacy? In his 32-year career, Reeves became a Wild West celebrity, with folk songs springing up about the marshal with almost mythical strength. He died in 1910, at the impressive age of 71, just as segregation laws were starting to take effect in his home state. Last year, a 23-foot (7-meter) bronze statue of Reeves, in all his gun-slinging glory atop a horse, was unveiled in Fort Smith, Arkansas. ""He's one of America's most important heroes and it's sad his story isn't known more than it is,"" said Burton. ""But unfortunately, the majority of black history has been buried. ""Even today, nobody knows where Reeves is buried -- I like to tell people he's still in disguise.""","Disney releases latest Lone Ranger film, but who was the real-life inspiration?

"A U.S. general who oversaw nuclear weapons boozed, fraternized with ""hot women"" and disrespected his hosts during an official visit to Russia this year, an investigative report shows. Maj. Gen. Michael Carey led the 20th Air Force responsible for three nuclear wings. He was relieved of duty in October because of loss of confidence in his leadership, the Air Force said at the time without providing specific details. But an Air Force Inspector General report released Thursday sheds more light into the case. It details the events of a July trip to  Moscow in which witnesses recalled Carey drinking too much. During a layover in Switzerland, the report states, he bragged loudly about his position as commander of a nuclear force, saying he ""saves the world from war every day."" And the shenanigans continued in Moscow, according to the report. Alcohol, comments flow . While there, Carey and an unidentified man walked to a nearby hotel to meet ""two foreign national women."" He returned to his Marriott hotel room in the wee hours of the morning. As a result, Carey was 45 minutes late in joining a delegation to the Moscow suburb of Sergiyev Posad, according to the report. He attributed the tardiness to jet lag, and said his body clock was out of whack. During a lunch banquet later, he downed more alcohol and talked about Syria and Edward Snowden, according to the report. Though the report did not reveal details on his talks, it said his Russian hosts were not amused by his comments. Russia granted Snowden, a former NSA contractor who released intelligence secrets, temporary asylum this year.  It is also a major ally of Syria. 'Very embarrassing' fist bump . In addition, Carey announced he'd ""met two hot women the night before,"" and continually interrupted a monastery guide during a tour, the report said, his speech slurred the entire time. ""At one point, he tried to give her (the guide) a fist bump,"" the report said, citing a witness. ""She had no idea what he was trying to do. It was again, very, very embarrassing."" The names of the witnesses are redacted in the report. During dinner at a Mexican restaurant, he drank more alcohol and wanted to perform with the live band, which wanted no part of it, the report said. He later left his delegation and joined the two women he'd met the night before at a different table. Tardiness and interruptions . Other inappropriate behavior included arriving at events late despite his Russian hosts' request to be on time,  and interrupting their toasts to make his own commentary. His conduct was unbecoming of an officer, the report said. The inspector general's office began its investigation after multiple ""reports of misbehavior"" while Carey was traveling on business.  He was reassigned a few weeks ago pending the outcome of the investigation. Experts say someone in his position should not put himself in a situation where he can unintentionally give up sensitive information. There was no indication Carey's behavior compromised sensitive nuclear information or  went beyond drinking, dancing and fraternizing with the women, officials said. CNN's repeated attempts to reach Carey were unsuccessful. Otherwise distinctive career . Though his behavior did not impact highly sensitive nuclear weapons operations, officials said, it is unbecoming for a job in such a critical position. ""This was an unfortunate incident.  Maj. Gen. Carey has otherwise served the nation extremely well,"" said  Gen William Shelton,  who heads the Air Force Space Command.  ""After full consideration of all the available information, I determined the evidence supported taking further command action in addition to his previous removal from command of 20th Air Force."" He was transferred to the Air Force  space operation. ""I am confident Maj. Gen. Carey will use his depth of space expertise to assist my command in providing foundational space and cyberspace capabilities to the warfighter,"" Shelton said. Leading the intercontinental nuclear ballistic missile facilities and operations is ""a position of great trust and responsibility,"" said Lt. Gen James Kowalski, head of the Air Force Global Strike Command.  ""Personal behavior is vital to that."" The U.S. delegation was in Russia for a bilateral presidential commission on military issues.

"Zimbabwe has asked neighboring southern African countries to help fund elections scheduled for the end of the month, the country's finance minister said Wednesday. Tendai Biti said he had released about $40 million of the $132 million the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission needs for the July 31 vote, ""but we are far away from reaching the target. We do not have the money. We can't increase taxes."" Biti is a member of Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change party (MDC). ""I have been in touch with the (Southern African Development Community) secretariat on the issue of trying to raise funds from the region. So it is something we are going to pursue. In fact it is something we have already started pursuing. We spoke to four countries in the region today. I can't disclose their names and what we discussed."" The 15-nation SADC pressured President Robert Mugabe to form a power-sharing government with Tsvangirai in 2009 following a violence-marred election. The 89-year-old Mugabe had claimed victory over Tsvangirai, the opposition leader at the time. Robert Mugabe: Fast Facts - Morgan Tsvangirai: Fast Facts . Biti said he had written to Mugabe asking him to force diamond-mining companies controlled by his party, ZANU PF, to release more than $150 million in profit they made in June. He added that his efforts to get international funding from the United Nations had been frustrated by Zimbabwe's justice minister, Patrick Chinamasa, a ZANU PF member. The UN said in March it was prepared to fund Zimbabwe's elections. But that fell through after its assessment mission was barred by Chinamasa from entering the country. That has left Harare with few options for funding; one such is the SADC. While launching his reelection bid Friday, Mugabe threatened to pull out of SADC, accusing it of being biased against ZANU PF. Last month, the regional bloc asked Mugabe to ensure a free and fair election.","Finance minister: Zimbabwe is well short of the $132 million needed to run its election .

"While the U.S. economy surges in 2014, posting the biggest jobs numbers in 15 years, the Russian economy is tanking straight into a recession after a bludgeon of Western sanctions. But the economic news hasn't translated to presidential approval ratings -- in either country. President Barack Obama has been facing some of his lowest job approval numbers this year while public support in Russia for President Vladimir Putin has surged over the last year to record highs. Putin's numbers aren't just high; they've surged from a 61% low in Nov. 2013 as events in Ukraine unfolded and despite sanctions hitting the country. And as opposed to Americans, a majority of Russians think their country is on the right track. A majority of Americans, 53% according to a CNN poll released last week, disapprove of Obama while 85% of Russians approve of Putin, according to a November poll from the highly cited Levada Center, an independent polling agency. Obama's struggling popularity had a concrete impact in November when his party suffered a drubbing at the polls on Election Day, despite low gas prices and the lowest unemployment numbers of his presidency. Meanwhile, the Russian government admitted this week the country should brace recession because of dramatic drops in oil prices and after a spree of Western sanctions over Russia's annexation of Crimea and its ongoing support for separatists in eastern Ukraine walloped the Russian currency and sent investors fleeing. Putin has remained defiant in the face of Western sanctions and political pressure to stand down in Ukraine. And that defiance is earning him political points at home despite the impact on the Russian economy. On Thursday Putin delivered a rallying state of the nation address in which he accused the West of replicating the Cold War containment strategy -- asserting that Western nations would have found a way to impose sanctions on Russia even without the crisis roiling in Ukraine -- and he called on Russians at home and abroad to come together. Speaking to top business leaders Wednesday, Obama appeared keenly aware of Putin's success in stirring nationalist sentiment to beat back the force international sanctions. ""If you ask me if I am optimistic that Putin suddenly changes his mindset, I don't think that will happen until the politics inside of Russia catch up to what's happening with the economy in Russia, which is part of the reason why we're going to maintain that pressure,"" Obama said, according to the International Business Times. But the political landscape Obama and Putin face couldn't be more different. Russian state media pumps out high levels of propaganda straight from the Kremlin, dissenting voices are censured and political dissenters are jailed. Ben Judah, author of ""Fragile Empire: How Russia Fell In And Out Of Love With Vladimir Putin,"" said those factors make it more difficult to gauge Russian public opinion. ""The very idea that people know about an alternative to Putin the way Americans know about an alternative to Obama like the Republicans is just laughable,"" Judah said. Judah acknowledged that there was an ""outburst of nationalist hysteria"" after Russia annexed Crimea, but said he believes Western sanctions are driving down public opinion of the Russian leader as the economy takes a hit. Henry Hale, an international affairs professor at The George Washington University specializing in Russian politics, said on the whole, the polls reflect the reality on the ground of popular support for Putin. ""I don't think Russians are really hiding their feelings,"" Hale said, adding that the polls indicate support for Putin, but not necessarily the depth of that support. Media propaganda plays a key role in bolstering Putin's popularity, Hale said, especially in the portrayal of Ukraine's popular revolt as a fascist takeover and in portraying the annexation of Crimea as, essentially, a rescue mission. While Russians have ""rallied around the leader"" in the face of Western sanctions, over time the economic impact of those sanctions could ultimately backfire on Putin. ""Over time people are going to say, 'Yeah ok we're happy with Russia being larger and its newfound role on the political stage. We're glad we have a leader standing up for us, but we also want a better economy,"" Hale said. So while the media does boost Putin's public image through ha ""barrage of positive images of him,"" economic realities will in the long term hit Putin, adding that Putin's strategy of blaming the West for hits to the economy is limited. ""After a while that starts to wear off,"" Hale said. But that could take years, he said.","The U.S. economy is roaring and the Russian economy is sagging .
President Obama is in an approval slump, but Vladimir Putin is seeing a popular surge ."

"Luay al-Khatteeb spoke to CNN about the impact of ISIS' march through northern Iraq, and the militant group's control of some oil fields. He explained how they used the oil fields to raise funds, and how it could impact global prices. This is an edited version of the conversation. How much of Iraq's oil market do ISIS control? ISIS control just a few marginal fields in Iraq's north, but they are enough to fund the terrorist group's self-sufficiency. A month ago, the ISIS--controlled oil market in Iraq was reported to be worth $1 million a day. Now, with expansion, further control of oil fields and smuggling routes, the market is believed to be raising at least $2 million a day. This could fetch them more than $730 million a year, enough to sustain the operation beyond Iraq. ISIS have been battling over Baiji and the refinery is still under siege. However, if ISIS succeed in capturing it, the refinery would be very difficult to operate without capable and technical staff. One important factor for the stability of global markets: ISIS is not yet in the south of Iraq, where the country's true oil bounty lies. Capturing the southern assets of the country would be mission impossible for the group. The territory is far from fault lines, and is dominated by Shia, which makes dominating the region difficult for the Sunni militant group. What do ISIS do with the oil they get? ISIS smuggle the crude oil and trade it for cash and refined products, at a reduced price. They also have their own small and rudimentary refineries in Syria. Refined oil is returned to ISIS for selling locally, in Iraq and Syria. ISIS also use the oil in their own warfare. ISIS controls smuggling routes and the crude transported by tankers to Jordan via Anbar province, to Iran via Kurdistan, to Turkey via Mosul, to Syria's local market and to the Kurdistan region of Iraq, where most of it gets refined locally. Turkey has turned a blind eye to this and may continue to do so until they come under pressure from the West to close down oil black markets in the country's south. ISIS' oil will remain limited to these black markets, and the group will have no chance to establish a sophisticated pipeline network. Fixed distribution networks are complex, require investment and can become targets by the Iraqi Army and Kurdish Peshmerga. What is ISIS' ultimate aim and how does oil wealth play into it? At present, ISIS are trying to establish a self-sufficient state and a capital in what is known as the ""Sunni triangle"" (west and north Iraq), and oil production will be part of this. They want to be self-sufficient, expand their territorial control, recruit more jihadists -- with focus on extremists with foreign passports -- and extend their operations, to eventually launch attacks on Western countries. ISIS declared its Caliphate by turning Iraq and Syria into a hub to attract extremists. They are aiming to take over the Arabian Peninsula as their epicenter to launch attacks globally. If this happens, they will be in control of a region that holds 60% of world's conventional energy reserves and produces 40% of global oil and gas production. And the only way to do it is by attracting the masses of jihadists and extremists from all over the world to eventually outnumber the locals, which will endanger global security and economies. How is ISIS' control of some of Iraq's oil fields impacting the global economy? In the short to mid-term, the impact will be minimal as Iraq's south is its dominant producer. However, there are enough rich assets in the midlands and the north part of Iraq that ISIS could reach out to, a potential capacity that could ramp up to a million barrels a day -- from its current 30,000 barrels a day -- should they seize control the oil-rich city of Kirkuk and its surrounding districts. If they succeed in controlling those assets, cash inflow could stretch their empire of terrorism beyond imagination. But so far, ISIS oil trading has remained local with buyers in Jordan, Turkey, Syria and Iran via middlemen network and truck owners. However, the instability created by Iraq effectively being broken up would have a ripple impact, in terms of hindering investment prospect in the country. In turn, that could prevent Iraq from reaching its 2020 target of 9 million barrels of oil production per day, which is three times Iraq's current oil supply and 10% of global demand.","Terrorist group ISIS controls some oil fields in North Iraq, which helps fund its activities .

"Shrimp pasta, steak and eggs, maybe a bacon cheddar double cheeseburger. Sound good? Those dishes, as prepared by restaurant chains, may look and taste good, but they're loaded with calories, saturated fat, sodium and sugar -- enough to earn them the dubious distinction of being named Xtreme Eating ""dis-honorees"" on this year's list from the Center for Science in the Public Interest, known as the CSPI. For the last six years, the CSPI has released Xtreme Eating Awards winners in its Nutrition Action Healthletter. But ""we think this year that this is the worst of some of the worst,"" said Jayne Hurley, CSPI senior nutritionist. ""They top the list for being extremely high in calories, saturated fat and salt or sugar."" Hurley, who has been analyzing restaurant foods since 1993, went through the menus of more than 200 chain restaurants looking for nutritional information. The nine finalists for 2013: .

It weighs in at 3,120 calories, 89 grams of saturated fat and 1,090 milligrams of sodium, according to CSPI, equal to three lasagna classico entrees and a tiramisu from Olive Garden. Cheesecake Factory's crispy chicken costoletta was not too far behind. According to the menu, it's a chicken breast lightly breaded and sautéed to a crispy golden brown. It is served with a lemon sauce, mashed potatoes and fresh asparagus. According to CSPI, it also has 2,610 calories, more than a 12-piece bucket of original recipe Kentucky Fried Chicken, and 4½ days' worth of saturated fat. Johnny Rockets bacon cheddar double burger, sweet potato fries and Big Apple shake. This meal packs on 3,500 calories, 88 grams of saturated fat -- that's four days' worth -- 3,720 milligrams of sodium and 15 teaspoons of sugar, according to CSPI. Country fried steak and eggs at the International House of Pancakes, or IHOP, has 1,760 calories, 23 grams of saturated fat, 3,720 milligrams of salt and 11 teaspoons -- nearly two days' worth -- of sugar, CSPI said. The veal porterhouse at Maggiano's Little Italy has roasted garlic, caramelized onions and lemon with crispy red potatoes. It also has 2,710 calories, 45 grams of saturated fat and 3,700 milligrams of sodium, the CSPI report said. Maggiano's chocolate zuccotto cake contains 1,820 calories, 62 grams of saturated fat and 26 teaspoons of sugar, according to CSPI. Smoothie King's peanut power plus grape smoothie may sound healthy, but the 40-ounce size has 1,460 calories and 22 teaspoons of sugar. Chili's full rack of baby back ribs with Shiner Bock BBQ sauce comes with homestyle fried and cinnamon apples.  It also comes, according to the report, with 2,330 calories, 45 grams of saturated fat and 6,490 milligrams of salt. And finally, Uno Chicago Grill's deep dish macaroni and three cheese had a day's worth of calories -- 1,980 -- and more than three days' worth of saturated fat, 71 grams. According to CSPI, it also contains 3,110 milligrams of sodium. ""The most surprising one to me was the smoothie,"" Hurley said. ""I think smoothies get this pass that they are better for you than they really are. When you go to Smoothie King looking for a snack and walk out with a 1,500 calorie drink, which is close to a day's worth of calories in a cup, that's shocking. ""I think people need to be warned about that. Smoothies have the illusion of being good for you, which I think is why it's important to warn people that the calories can skyrocket."" Worst fast-food meals for sodium . CNN reached out to all restaurants on the list. The Cheesecake Factory did not respond to requests for comment. IHOP noted its menu does offer healthier choices. ""At IHOP, our menu is all about choice and giving our guests a full range of items to choose from that fits their lifestyle,"" spokesman Craig Hoffman said. ""In addition to offering indulgent classic favorites like country fried steak, our menu also features a complete selection of 'Simple & Fit' items, all of which are under 600 calories and include at least one item in every category,"" he said. ""These also include our recently introduced 'Simple & Fit' whole wheat waffles, pancakes and crepes as well as our new proprietary blend of Quaker Oatmeal."" Rick Hendrie, senior vice president of marketing for Uno's, says the chain is doing its best to make sure people have choices. ""There is no question that particular item is indulgent,"" he said. ""But with every single section on the menu, we have items that are also nutritious and delicious, so that you always have a choice. ""We've really worked hard to make sure that choice is everywhere,"" he said. ""In addition, every single one of our restaurants has a nutrition kiosk which is in the lobby, and all the information about our items, every single one, all the nutritional information about allergens, is available and transparent."" Several restaurants questioned the numbers, telling CNN they had different totals. ""The results included in the CSPI study were significantly higher than our findings,"" said Maureen Locus, spokeswoman for Brinker International, the parent company of Chili's and Maggiano's. ""While menu item ingredient information is based on standardized product recipes, variations in nutritional content may occur due to in-restaurant preparation, portion size variances and guest customization of menu items, among other factors."" CSPI says it got the nutritional information from company websites.

""With this in mind, restaurants provide an array of menu options including a growing selection of healthful menu options.

The average adult should consume about 2,000 calories a day, according to the Food and Drug Administration.

The National Restaurant Association advocated for the move, Dubost said. Hurley's advice in the meantime? ""When you're dining out, skip the appetizers and dessert.

"Lindsay Lohan has filed suit against a video game maker, alleging the company based the likeness of a character on her. The actress filed suit Wednesday in a Manhattan court against Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. and its subsidiaries, Rockstar Games and Rockstar North, over the character of Lacey Jonas from the game ""Grand Theft Auto V."" According to the suit, Lohan alleges the company based the character on her and ""incorporated her image, likeness, clothing, outfits, Plaintiff's clothing line products, ensemble in the form of hats, hair style, sunglasses, jean shorts worn by Plaintiff that were for sale to the public at least two years before the Defendant's release of the GTA V game."" The suit goes on to say that ""the game also features Hotel Chateau (Marmont) in West Hollywood, a place where the Plaintiff once lived and often frequents."" In the popular video game, the character is an actress who complains of being pursued by paparazzi and asks another character to help her flee. The character utters such lines as, ""They cannot get a shot of me,"" and ""How's my hair? Do I look cute?"" In an e-mail, a spokesman for the company told CNN, ""It is our company policy to not comment on legal matters."" It would not be the first time Lohan has taken to the courts alleging others were trading on her and her image. In 2010 she sued E*Trade over a Super Bowl commercial that made mention of ""that milkaholic Lindsay,"" which Lohan alleged was a reference to her. In 2011 she sued rapper Pitbull for using her name in a lyric of the song ""Give Me Everything Tonight."" The suit against E*Trade was reportedly settled, and her suit against Pitbull was dismissed, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

"The Ukraine crisis simmered Wednesday, if not with actual fighting, then with fighting words from the key outside players in the conflict: the United States and Russia, whose foreign minister accused Washington of ""running the show"" in Kiev. In an interview with state-run RT, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov lamented how he felt U.S. officials were quick to blame his nation for everything awry in Ukraine and to insist Moscow can unilaterally solve it all. Lavrov said that while those in Ukraine's east and south who defiantly oppose the Kiev-based government are ""not puppets"" of the Kremlin, such a characterization would describe the relationship between Ukraine's leadership in Kiev and the United States. ""(Americans) have, I think, overwhelming influence,"" he said. ""They act in a much more open way, without any scruples, compared to the Europeans ... You cannot avoid the impression that they are running the show very much, very much."" As proof, Lavrov pointed to the timing of the Ukrainian government's relaunch of its security operation just after a two-day visit  from U.S. Vice President Joe Biden. He claimed acting President Oleksandr Turchynov has ""ordered the army to shoot at ... people if they are engaged in peaceful protests,"" yet hasn't disarmed extremists and what he called ""the right sector."" Some in Ukraine's east are occupying official buildings, defying the Kiev government and openly siding with Russia""after several months of total neglect of their interests,"" Lavrov said. The minister faulted the new Kiev government  for not doing more, including taking the necessary ""first step"" to implement an international deal brokered in Geneva, Switzerland. About a week after being reached, that deal has done little to defuse the crisis. On the contrary, both sides appear to be digging in. Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Vitaliy Yarema said Wednesday that ""the active phase of the anti-terrorist operation continues"" in the eastern cities of Kramatorsk, Slavyansk, Donetsk and Luhansk, according to state-run news agency Ukrinform. Militants in those cities have shown no inclination to leave the government buildings they have seized or disarm, as was mandated by the Geneva agreement. Meanwhile, NATO estimates that Russia has massed 40,000 troops near its border with Ukraine, which has fueled speculation the conflict could only get bigger and more violent, with Russia possibly taking over some, if not all, of Ukraine and possibly neighboring nations. Lavrov didn't say any military intervention was imminent, but he didn't rule it out, either. ""If our interests, our legitimate interests, the interests of Russians have been attacked directly -- like they were in South Ossetia for example -- I do not see any other way but to respond in accordance with international law,"" he told RT, referring to Russia's 2008 invasion of Georgia. ""Russian citizens being attacked is an attack against the Russian Federation."" U.S. vows to defend fellow NATO members . The United States isn't standing still militarily, sending personnel to allied nations near Ukraine that have grown increasingly wary of Russia's military intentions. On Wednesday, a company-size contingent of U.S. Army paratroopers arrived in Swidwin, Poland, for training exercises at Warsaw's request. They'll be there through at least the end of the year, according to Stephen Mull, the U.S. ambassador to Poland. The contingent is part of ""a persistent rotational presence"" that Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby has said will involve four Italy-based companies of paratroopers that will go to Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia over the next few months. ""Poland has been there for the United States,"" Mull said Wednesday in front U.S. troops standing in formation next to Polish troops. ""Today, as the trans-Atlantic community confronts Russia's unacceptable aggression against Poland's neighbor, Ukraine, a sovereign and independent state, we have a solemn obligation in the framework of NATO to reassure Poland of our security guarantee."" The United States and its allies have accused Russia of fomenting unrest in Ukraine since massive demonstrations helped push out President Viktor Yanukovych, who came under fire for moving Ukraine away from the European Union and closer to Russia. The allegations include Moscow's sending members of its armed forces into the country, providing other support for pro-Russian militants or generally contributing to an atmosphere of distrust and instability. Whatever the cause or culprit, a part of Ukraine -- Crimea -- has broken off and joined Russia. Some in the West fear that Russia will try to repeat that scenario elsewhere in Ukraine and perhaps in other countries in which ethnic Russians live or where Russia or the former Soviet Union historically has had significant influence. Some of those countries include the Baltic states and Poland, which, like the United States, are part of NATO. The treaty that defines this alliances states that if any one NATO member ""is the victim of an armed attack, each and every other member of the alliance will consider this act of violence as an armed attack against all members and will take the actions it deems necessary to assist the Ally attacked."" As a result, the United States and its NATO allies are publicly stepping up involvement in places like Poland to dissuade Russian President Vladimir Putin from thinking that advancing into these countries is an option, according to Kurt Volker, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO. ""I think that if we did not take the steps that we are taking now, (Putin) would think that maybe it's an option,"" Volker, who served as ambassador from 2008 and 2009, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. ""... If we did not do that, I think he would wonder: What would be the response of NATO if he did have some ... action there?"" Counterclaims over politician's death . Within Ukraine itself -- particularly the east and south -- government forces and pro-Russian militants continued their unsettling standoff. The situation seemed largely peaceful, with hints of violence here and there. A Ukrainian army helicopter, for instance, was targeted Wednesday ""by unknown gunmen"" in Kramatorsk, which is about 9 miles (15 kilometers) from Slavyansk. On Ukraine's Internal Affairs Ministry website, Deputy Minister Sergiy Yaroviy said the helicopter suffered ""minor damage"" to its blades but was able to land safely, with no injuries to its crew. The same couldn't be said about the discovery Saturday of two tortured bodies near Slavyansk. One of them was pro-Kiev politician Vladimir Rybak, who Ukraine's Interior Ministry said Wednesday died as a result of injuries from torture and drowning. Stanislav Rechinsky, an adviser to the interior minister, blamed pro-Russian militants for having tortured and ""kidnapped"" him and others. ""We have eyewitnesses who testified about hearing the so-called little green men bragging about the murders,"" he said Wednesday. ""We have another eyewitness who saw these men alive in the torture cells and who was able to escape."" The term ""little green men"" has become widely used for the unidentified armed men who have appeared in eastern Ukraine in recent days. Russia has denied they are Russian military forces in uniforms that don't bear insignia. Yet a pro-Russian leader in Slavyansk, de facto Mayor Vyacheslav Ponomaryo, vehemently denies such allegations, instead blaming the deaths on far-right Ukrainian nationalist extremists.","Official: Gunmen fire at Ukrainian army helicopter near Slavyansk .

"In a move sure to attract attention from the music industry, a small group of coders claiming to be part of Anonymous is putting together a social music platform. The rather ambitious goal: Create a service that seamlessly pulls up songs streaming from all around the internet. The project, called Anontune and still in its infancy, is designed to pull songs from third-party sources like YouTube and let anonymous users put them into playlists and share them — while keeping the service from being shut down by music industry lawsuits. Reached by e-mail, one of the creators of Anontune told Wired the project was started by a group of anons who met online six years ago on what was then an underground hacking site. The group, mostly focused at the time on ""cracking,"" began discussing music, favorite artists and what they would do to fix current music business models. ""We would say stuff like, 'People really use YouTube as a music player yet it really sucks for that purpose ... it's too unorganized,'"" the anon wrote to Wired. ""And then, 'YouTube does make a good music player but you can't play all your songs on it since the obscure ones aren't uploaded,' then eventually, 'Hmmm, what if you were to combine music websites like Myspace, Yahoo, YouTube and others?'"" On the ever-sprawling internet, music can pop up anywhere — Tumblr pages, blogs, The Hype Machine (to name but a few). Almost any song is available at any time, whether posted by legitimate sources or uploaded by fans or pirates, and Anontune would tap into that rich reservoir. It wouldn't be the first time Anonymous squared off with the record industry: When popular file-sharing site Megaupload was shuttered by the Justice Department in January, Anonymous retaliated by attacking the websites of the Recording Industry Association of America and the DoJ. The DDoS attacks provide an undeniable look at what Anonymous can do in a copyfight, but if the creators of Anontune succeed, they could make something far more disruptive to the music industry. The Anontune concept remained nothing more than talk until one day in early December, when an anon posted a link to Anontune and said he planned to make their ideas a reality. The others looked at the site. Although it wasn't very good, the working prototype got enough people interested in the project that they ""formed a team that day and stopped hacking,"" the anon said. The platform has been in development for just a few months, according to the video above (titled ""Message From Anonymous: Music Has Changed""). Although Anontune is still very rudimentary, the service is meant to improve the way music is played online. ""It has come to our attention that the state of online music has been sabotaged by the fat hands of corporate involvement,"" the Anontune video's voiceover states. ""These changes have led to a world in which your enjoyment of music is controlled and billed by the minute."" How Anontune Works (And a Word of Caution) Anontune works by automating what most people do online manually. After setting up an account, users can build playlists by simply typing in the names of songs they want to hear, or they can choose from the names of songs imported from their iPods. Anontune's ""music engine"" — which runs in a user's browser — then finds the songs on the web. Currently most of the tracks come from YouTube and SoundCloud, but there are plans in the works to add Yahoo Music, Myspace Music, Bandcamp and others. From there, users, of which there are currently fewer than 1,000, just press play. (A word of caution to curious readers: The system relies on executing a Java applet. Unless you are extremely trusting or using VMWare, you should think very carefully about running code on your machine that was written by members of Anonymous.) The stated central aims of the service's creators are to provide a flexible, open platform for users to listen to music without having to pirate it or face legal repercussions — read Anontune's white paper here. True to form, users of the service can largely remain anonymous. Although the site is still very crude and its origins obscure, the idea of Anonymous — even a few far-flung members of the group — tackling online music is compelling. But Anontune could come into the world with a target on its back, even if it operates using completely legitimate methods, according to Electronic Frontier Foundation attorney Corynne McSherry. ""What we're seeing here is a situation where the government is getting much more involved in enforcement, and we know that the U.S. government doesn't like Anonymous all that much anyway,"" McSherry said in an interview with Wired. Other music services can attempt to cut deals with music labels to avoid legal hot water, but that's not really an option here. ""I think content owners, if they feel like the site is a really viable site, they're going to be pretty nervous [about this],"" McSherry said. ""Because they like to have people that they can make deals with, and there's no one to make a deal with in this situation."" It's hard not to notice that Anontune is popping up just as the U.S. government's case against Megaupload is getting heated. Even though Anontune's creators say the service isn't a rebuttal to the shuttering of the file-sharing service, its timely unveiling could serve as a model for a different way for Anonymous to respond to incidents (as opposed to, say, directing Low Orbit Ion Cannons at the website of the Recording Industry Association of America). ""The project is not so much a response to Megaupload but a response to the tycoons from the RIAA shutting down music services,"" the anon wrote to Wired. ""You may have heard about what Anonymous has done in Operation Payback. We believe the underlying reasons for the revolt were (mostly) correct, however their approach is unlikely to change anything in the long run."" When asked about Anontune by Wired, an RIAA spokesman declined to comment. Anontune's creators hope that in its complete version — it's only about 20 percent there so far, our source said — the service can improve the way people engage with music. ""We have a lot of plans regarding this,"" the Anontune co-creator told Wired. ""The development of software to assist in achieving musical peak experiences, illumination of the functions and roles of music, psychometric testing based on music preference. It's all there and this is possibly the most interesting part of the whole project."" Anontune's technical aspects can be reviewed online, and the site's operators are taking donations. Even though its creators are still hurriedly trying to get the service up to snuff, the site has massive goals. One only needs to look at the final note on the above clip's YouTube page to get a taste. ""We need to think bigger,"" it reads. ""This is Operation Mozart.""","Group identified as Anonymous putting together a social-music platform .

"Iraq's second largest museum in Sulaimaniya is recovering stolen artifacts by paying smugglers to return the treasures. Located in the semi-autonomous northern region of Kurdistan, the Slemani Museum has taken drastic measures to refill display cabinets following looting. ""The position of not just UNESCO but the international museum community is that we don't buy back looted objects because it encourages looting. Simple. Full stop,"" says Stuart Gibson, director of the UNESCO Sulaimaniya Museum Project. ""The Kurdish authorities took a very difficult and I must admit a very courageous position and they said we are going to buy these objects,"" he added. Iraq has struggled with looters, most notably in 2003 when thieves sacked the National Museum in Baghdad stealing treasures dating thousands of years to the beginnings of civilization in Mesopotamia. Original estimates said 170,000 pieces had been looted from the museum. However, authorities say it was closer to around 15,000 artifacts, of which 6,000 had been recovered by the time the museum reopened in 2009. While paying smugglers for the return of lost treasures is a controversial move on the part of the museum, it seems to have worked in this instance. One of the recently-recovered artifacts is an ancient democratic text that smugglers asked just $600 for. ""It's a full Sumerian text written during the old Babylonian period, around 1,800-900 B.C.,"" says Dr. Farouk Al-Rawi, a professor in the Department of Languages and Cultures of the Near and Middle East at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London. ""It is the first document to tell us about democracy. It concerns the establishment of two assemblies,"" he added. The return of this tablet to the museum is ironic considering that thousands of years later, Iraq is still trying to establish a semblance of a democracy. Despite the Slemani Museum's unorthodox move, smuggling has decreased in the region in part due to the growing awareness of the problem and a joint effort by authorities. But organizations say more help is needed to stop thieves. The museum's director Hashim Abdulla says that in the region of Kurdistan there are still thousands of undiscovered sites yet to be excavated. He points out a recent site in a small village 20 minutes outside of Sulaimaniya. Artifacts at this location have dated back to the Assyrian period, almost 3,000 years ago. Under Kurdistan regional governmental laws the site should become a protected area but in reality in many cases those laws are too difficult to implement.","Selmani museum in Kurdistan is paying smugglers to return looted treasure .

"Ashley and Tyson Gardner tried unsuccessfully for years to get pregnant. Finally, the Utah couple learned in July that their first in-vitro fertilization attempt was successful. But the real surprise came during the ultrasound, when they learned she was pregnant with quadruplets. Luckily, a friend was in the room to capture the look on Gardner's face in a picture that is delighting parents, moms-to-be and just about anyone else who has a heart. A BabyCenter article on the picture was shared 2,600 times from its Facebook page, drawing nearly 15,000 likes. In the past week, the Gardners' Facebook page, where they share news about their pregnancy, grew by nearly 16,000 likes to 24,300. Ashley Gardner shared some thoughts via email with CNN about her experience with infertility and becoming an internet sensation. CNN: What other methods did you try before IVF? Ashley Gardner: We tried EVERYTHING under the sun. We tried for 8 long years (taking a few months of here and there to keep our sanity!) our efforts included, diet, a surgery on my end (laparoscopy), medications then onto 4 fails IUI's and then we saved up for IVF and BAM! It worked really really really REALLY well! Record number of women using IVF to get pregnant . CNN: What made you decide to start sharing your journey on Facebook? Gardner: So about a year and a half ago I decided to open up about our infertility struggles. It was getting hard getting asked ALL THE TIME why I didn't have children yet. I was sick of making excuses for something that was out of my control and emotionally affecting me so much. I opened up and couldn't believe the outpouring support I started getting from EVERYONE! Even people I didn't know. It was an amazing feeling to not be hiding this awful disease of infertility anymore and openly talking about it! I found that so many others were going through the same thing! And I've since been able to help so many others struggling and feeling so alone during this heartbreaking journey. As for our Facebook page, my awesome sister Whitney set that up for me when we announced that we were having quads. We just announced on our private pages to our friends and family and the picture was so priceless that everyone started sharing it and we started getting hundreds of friend requests from people we didn't know. So we did the Facebook page so that everyone can follow our story and we can still keep our personal Facebook pages for ourselves. CNN: Do you remember what was going through your mind when you found out you had quads? Gardner: ""OH MY GOSH!!!!!!!"" I couldn't think straight! I had never been so excited and terrified in the same instant. We waited so long to have babies so we were so happy... But at that time we literally had NEVER even thought once about this being a possibility. We didn't know anything about having quads and the risks that go with it. But overall, we were just excited!!!! My husband is the oldest of 10 children so he is ready to take on anything! He can calm any baby and entertain any kid. They love him. He is the favorite uncle to all our nieces and nephews. We are ready! Our doctors say that everything is in our favor for this going great. Doesn't mean it won't be hard. But we can handle it! Identical quadruplets surprise mom expecting triplets . CNN: Dumb question: Were you surprised? Gardner: YES!!!! After eight long, heartbreaking years of infertility and every month passing by with a negative pregnancy test you do get discouraged! You hold on to as much hope as you can and sometimes you lose it. But you dust yourself off get up and try again! My endometriosis (cause of our infertility) was so bad that we found during the IVF process that it had compromised my eggs. Out of all the eggs they got they all started dying off and left us with 1 perfect egg and one good egg. They put both back to give me the best odds of one sticking so we would at least get one baby out of this since I didn't have any eggs to freeze and this was probably our last shot at this. The chances of even getting one to stick was 40%. To have both stick and both split... well, that's a 1 in 70 million chance! It was meant to be! CNN: Do you have any idea how the photos got picked up and started going ""viral""? Gardner: Only thing I can think of is what I stated above. People loved the announcement picture so much they shared it and it just kept going. The real reason behind the multiples baby boom .","After years of trying Ashley and Tyson Gardner got pregnant through first IVF attempt .

"(CNN) -- ISIS demanded 100 million euros ($132.5 million) in ransom for the release of James Foley, the American journalist kidnapped and killed by the terrorist group in Syria, according to a spokesman for GlobalPost, the news website for which Foley freelanced. It was never a serious demand, far exceeding the amounts of money paid for hostages held by jihadist militant groups in the past, which typically ranged up to several million dollars. But the demand does shine a light on two uncomfortable facts about ""Kidnap & Ransom,"" or K&R, the dark netherworld of professionals who work to negotiate between murderous groups like ISIS and the terrified families whose loved ones have been kidnapped. It also includes their worried employers and Western governments such as France that will pay ransoms, and other governments, notably the United States and the United Kingdom, that will not. The first uncomfortable fact is that if you pay a ransom a hostage is more likely to be released. The other is that every time a ransom is paid it increases the chance that other hostages will be taken to help fill the coffers of a terrorist group. According to an investigation by The New York Times, al Qaeda and its affiliates have netted at least $125 million in ransoms since 2008. That finding is similar to a 2012 U.S. Treasury estimate that $120 million had been paid to terrorist organizations during the previous eight years. Much of this revenue reportedly comes from France. French media reported that the government had paid 20 million euros (about $28 million) for the release of four employees of a French nuclear firm. They were held by an al Qaeda affiliate for three years in northern Niger and were released last year. The French government denied paying a ransom, but The New York Times indicated -- based on reports from Le Monde and Agence France-Presse -- that France did pay in that case and has paid out a total of some $58 million to al Qaeda or related groups. Not surprisingly, the Times also found that of the 53 hostages known to have been taken by al Qaeda and its affiliates during the past five years, a third were French. The French government's purported policy of negotiating with militant groups for the release of kidnapped citizens does appear to work. Four French journalists -- Nicolas Henin, Pierre Torres, Edouard Elias and Didier FranÃ§ois, who were kidnapped in Syria last year by ISIS -- were released near the Turkish border in April, blindfolded and with their hands bound. One of those hostages, Henin, had been held by ISIS alongside Foley. Henin is free, and Foley is dead. These are the facts that policymakers must confront as they consider what to do about the other Western hostages still held by ISIS. Who is ISIS currently holding? ISIS holds three Americans, including Steven Sotloff, a freelance journalist who was kidnapped last August and who the terrorist group threatened to kill in the video it released showing Foley's beheading. The names of the other two Americans being held by ISIS have not been publicly disclosed; CNN is withholding their names and occupations. Two Italian women are reported to be among the militant group's newest captives. A Dane and a Japanese national were seized along with the two Italians. The group of four was recently moved to Raqqa, an ISIS stronghold in northern Syria. For these hostages, there is always the chance that their governments will mount a rescue operation as the United States did in Syria in July to try and rescue Foley and the other Americans. That mission failed because the hostages had been moved from a location they had been kept in for some months. There is also the possibility that hostages could escape, as American photographer Matthew Schrier did last year when he managed to crawl out of a window of the prison where he was being held in in the Syrian city of Aleppo by an Islamist militant group. But such escapes are rare, and while successful rescue efforts do happen, they are fraught with risks for the hostages. Linda Norgrove, for instance, a British aid worker held by the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2010, was killed in a U.S. rescue operation, likely by a grenade that exploded near her. If there's not an escape or a successful rescue effort, Western governments whose citizens are held by ISIS have only the options of either a negotiation involving ransom or the real possibility that their hostages may be executed. This is the sobering choice that faces President Barack Obama and his national security advisers. It's not much of a choice at all.","Peter Bergen, Emily Schneider: ISIS wanted $132.5 million in ransom for James Foley .

"Washington (CNN) -- A majority of Americans think the federal government poses a threat to the rights of Americans, according to a new national poll. Fifty-six percent of people questioned in a CNN/Opinion Research Corporation survey released Friday say they think the federal government has become so large and powerful that it poses an immediate threat to the rights and freedoms of ordinary citizens. Forty-four percent of those polled disagree. The survey indicates a partisan divide on the question: Only 37 percent of Democrats, 63 percent of independents and nearly seven in 10 Republicans say the federal government poses a threat to the rights of Americans. According to CNN poll numbers released Sunday, Americans overwhelmingly think that the U.S. government is broken, though the public overwhelmingly holds out hope that what's broken can be fixed. The CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll was conducted February 12-15, with 1,023 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points for the overall survey.","Poll: 56 percent think federal government is a threat to freedoms of ordinary citizens .

"(CNN)The scene of devastation is staggering in Debaltseve, the town at the heart of the battle between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists in recent days. Barely a house is unscathed by shelling. Elderly civilians trapped by the fighting still cower in basements. After most Ukrainian forces pulled out Wednesday, the separatists are now in control. It's obvious there's been a seismic shift on the battlefield. But it's not yet clear what the Ukrainian withdrawal means for the shaky peace deal that came into force Sunday. Will the separatists halt their offensive, satisfied with the territory they hold? Or will they be emboldened to push for more? The leaders of Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany spoke Thursday by phone in an attempt to patch up the deal, rocked by the fierce fighting for control of Debaltseve, a strategic railroad hub. They called for the ceasefire to be respected along the entire front line and for the withdrawal of heavy weaponry by both sides to create a buffer zone, as agreed to in Minsk, Belarus. But skeptics may wonder whether it's too late to salvage the deal, hammered out a week ago by the four leaders -- Germany's Angela Merkel, France's François Hollande, Ukraine's Petro Poroshenko and Russia's Vladimir Putin. The ramifications for the West are huge because the 10-month-long conflict in eastern Ukraine has hiked tensions with Russia to a level not seen since the end of the Cold War, affecting trade and raising the specter of a Russian threat to Eastern Europe. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh, who was able to return to Debaltseve on Thursday after a two-week absence, said the physical change in the town was astounding, with destruction on a wide scale. Terrified elderly women are still taking shelter in the basement of a building formerly held by Ukrainian forces but now in rebel hands, he said. Humanitarian aid deliveries have started quickly, with food parcels brought in on trucks run by the separatists. Those still in Debaltseve -- a fraction of its former population of 25,000 -- are angered by what has happened to their hometown. A Ukrainian tank and other destroyed military armor could be seen across the town, and the noise of machine gun fire could be heard, suggesting some Ukrainian soldiers are still holed up on the edges of Debaltseve, Paton Walsh said. The rumble of shelling also continued, mostly in the distance. It's not clear yet how many civilians, separatist militants or Ukrainian soldiers died during the days of fighting for Debaltseve or in attempts to leave the town. Ukrainian leaders claim their troops' withdrawal was strategic and organized, but the signs indicate that a vastly better equipped separatist force outgunned them and that they came under fire while retreating. Separatist fighters who spoke to CNN said the road out of town was still a contested area. Kiev and the West accuse Russia of arming and training the separatists and sending Russian troops over the border to fight with them. Russia has steadfastly denied the claim. Debaltseve: Inside the ghost town . Ukraine's Poroshenko has not hesitated to point the finger at Russia over the fighting this week in Debaltseve. ""The whole world saw that Russia doesn't adhere to its commitments,"" he said after his troops' hasty retreat. ""In my telephone conversation with Merkel, Hollande and Putin I stressed that the situation around Debaltseve was in breach of Minsk accords,"" he tweeted a day later. According to his office, Poroshenko asked for ""definite guarantees in case there are further attempts to violate the agreements."" The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which is tasked with monitoring the ceasefire, has criticized the separatists for refusing to allow its monitors into Debaltseve. Michael Bociurkiw, the OSCE spokesman in Kiev, told CNN on Thursday that the organization had made contact with both the Ukrainians and the separatists regarding access to Debaltseve. Separatist leaders in Luhansk and Donetsk said they were unable to provide safe passage for the OSCE monitors, he said, so ""at the moment it is not possible for us to visit the area."" Poroshenko said all four leaders had agreed in their phone call that the OSCE should be supported in its mission and that full access should be ensured starting Thursday, particularly around Donetsk's airport and in other towns where fighting has occurred in the past hours. Only after a full ceasefire is achieved will the drawback of heavy weapons start under direct OSCE observation, he said. A statement from Hollande's office said the leaders had agreed the ceasefire should be in effect on the entire front line without exception. The leaders called for an acceleration in the release of prisoners held by both sides, as agreed to under the Minsk deal. Poroshenko said this release should include those captured in Debaltseve. A statement from the Kremlin said the leaders had stressed that the start of the implementation of the Minsk agreement had led to a decrease in military activity in eastern Ukraine and fewer civilian casualties. ""The leaders emphasized the need of holding a ceasefire, taking real steps to withdraw the heavy weapons and release of prisoners,"" it said. Poroshenko sought to portray his forces' retreat from Debaltseve as organized and orderly, disputing separatists' claims that the Ukrainian troops were surrounded and surrendered their arms. The separatists regarded Debaltseve as already being their territory when the front lines for the ceasefire were drawn. Hours after Kiev pulled its troops out of Debaltseve, Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council said it would ask for U.N. peacekeepers to be sent to eastern Ukraine. But a spokesman for Russia's Foreign Ministry, Alexander Lukashevich, said Moscow rejects any such call. The Minsk agreement is the basis for the ceasefire and resolution of the conflict, so there's no need for international monitoring, Lukashevich said at a televised briefing. He added that the government in Kiev was responsible for its implementation. ""We're convinced the full responsibility of fulfillment of the agreement lies only on the parties of the conflict,"" Lukashevich said. Poroshenko said the question of deploying peacekeepers along the front line and the Ukraine-Russia border had been included in the Minsk agenda. Speaking later Thursday in Kiev, he insisted that Russia, given its alleged involvement in the conflict, could not play a role in peacekeeping operations in Ukraine. ""Ukraine will not agree to a peacekeeping format, which threatens to legalize thousands of Russian militaries -- we already have enough such 'peacekeepers,' "" he said. In a sign of the heightened tensions between Russia and other European nations, Britain's Royal Air Force scrambled fighter jets Wednesday after Russian aircraft were identified flying close to UK airspace, the Ministry of Defence said. ""The Russian planes were escorted by the RAF until they were out of the UK area of interest. At no time did the Russian military aircraft cross into UK sovereign airspace,"" a spokeswoman said. UK Defence Secretary Michael Fallon told Britain's Telegraph newspaper that there's a ""real and present danger"" that Putin would use murky tactics to destabilize the Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, which border Russia on NATO's eastern flank. CNN's Alla Eshchenko, Matthew Chance and Khushbu Shah contributed to this report as did journalist Victoria Butenko in Kiev.","A CNN team finds wide destruction in Debaltseve, now in separatist hands .

"(CNN) -- ISIS, al Qaeda, weapons of mass destruction -- it's easy to understand why these threats to global stability consistently make the headlines. But it doesn't take a nuclear device to devastate countries. While the international community has mobilized to tackle global threats posed by terrorism and nuclear proliferation, hundreds of thousands of people have already been killed by conventional weapons that have largely been overlooked by headlines and policymakers. Despite the immeasurable human suffering caused from Latin America to the Middle East by conventional weapons such as machine guns and grenade launchers, it has been an uphill battle to generate the international will to control and regulate this trade -- until now. After years of difficult negotiations, governments joined together to adopt the Arms Trade Treaty. The treaty, which enters into force this week, is the only global, legally binding defense against the irresponsible and largely unregulated international arms trade. I spent more than five years advising the United Nations and the diplomats that drafted it, and the treaty has enjoyed widespread global support since the U.N. General Assembly adopted it in April 2013. Indeed, only three countries opposed its adoption: Iran, Syria and North Korea. And it's a good treaty. It's not a perfect one, but for the first time, the estimated $85 billion annual trade will have clear rules: outright prohibition of some arms transfers, greater scrutiny over others and government obligations to consider whether a transfer would contribute to violations of international humanitarian law, human rights law or be used to commit gender-based violence before a transfer is granted. In short, the treaty represents a global foundation from which countries can build and adapt their own policies. And, by formalizing the global rules of the road to help prevent powerful weapons from falling into the hands of bad actors, the security of the United States and our allies will be strengthened. So why is the United States suddenly absent from the front lines of recent discussions to shape the treaty's future? To its credit, the Obama administration actively participated in treaty negotiations, demanding that the text meet U.S. requirements, including that there be no change in U.S. law. These concessions allowed the United States to sign the treaty three months after it was opened for signature, and as a result the United States maintained that it wanted to be part of the treaty and help plan for its future. Yet at a meeting to discuss the future of the Arms Trade Treaty last month in Berlin, the United States was conspicuously absent. The Obama administration said it skipped the gathering because it was protesting the decision not to allow all U.S. civil society organizations and industry into the meeting. The Berlin meeting was only open to those organizations that could demonstrate a record of actively promoting the Arms Trade Treaty and supporting its objectives and purpose, preventing groups that have worked to try to undermine the treaty, such as the National Rifle Association, from admission. As a result, other governments are now questioning the depth of U.S. commitment to the treaty. And while missing one meeting may not harm the United States moving forward, its strong-arm tactics hardly seems constructive. Insisting other governments give in to U.S. demands and open the meeting to treaty opponents and nonsignatories alienates treaty supporters. After all, the treaty is no longer being negotiated -- after Wednesday it is international law, and it is time to set the treaty up for success in the long term. Of course, the Arms Trade Treaty is far from a panacea -- it is not going to put an end to all global illicit arms transfers. But it will help states develop laws, regulations and good practice to inhibit illegal and irresponsible transfers and better regulate the legitimate flow of weapons to help reduce human suffering. The U.S. reluctance to engage constructively is all the more disappointing because it has good practices and experiences on the arms trade to promote and share with other countries, and also, as the largest arms producer and exporter, its views and actions carry significant weight internationally. This treaty has been years in the making, and will help address an issue that is far too often overlooked. The United States should therefore embrace the leadership platform -- something it can't do from the sidelines.","Conventional weapons are often overlooked in headlines, Rachel Stohl says .
