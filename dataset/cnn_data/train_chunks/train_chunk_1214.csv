"Jobseekers from the European Union are to be barred from having their wages topped up by the state, Iain Duncan Smith has revealed. The Work and Pensions Secretary told MPs people who come to the UK will not be able to claim universal credit, which is replacing all of the main out-of-work benefits and tax credits. Mr Duncan Smith’s intervention fuelled speculation that a bar on access to the new credit will be a centrepiece of a keenly-anticipated speech by David Cameron on how the Conservatives plan to reduce Britain’s lure as a destination for EU migrants. Scroll down for video . Iain Duncan Smith is planning a new universal credit to replace all out-of-work benefits and tax credits . The UK was branded a ‘honeypot nation’ this week as a new analysis revealed the extent to which taxpayers are subsidising low-paid migrant workers. The Government has announced a series of measures to crack down on those who come here to claim out-of-work benefits, with a six-month waiting period being introduced within the next few months. But critics argue the bigger issue is the generous top-ups to low paid jobs that are offered by Labour’s complex system of tax credits. Research by the Open Europe think-tank suggested a foreign worker with two children earning the minimum wage sees a basic income of less than £200 a week propped up with an additional £330 in tax credits and other benefits. New jobseekers arriving from the EU will be prohibited from applying for the new benefit, it is believed . Yesterday, in the Commons, Mr Duncan Smith said universal credit was a ‘different kind’ of benefit and suggested it would not be offered to those who come to the UK. The Department for Work and Pensions is understood to have drawn up plans for Downing Street to use the universal credit system to reduce the attractiveness of the UK to migrants from the EU. Ministers are expected to argue that restricting access to the benefit will not breach EU rules on the free movement of workers, since it is not primarily designed to facilitate access to the labour market. ‘Universal credit is not primarily a job-seeking benefit,’ said one source. ‘It’ s an anti-poverty, anti-welfare dependency benefit. It is social security. ‘National governments in the EU are perfectly able to control who accesses those sorts of benefits – and EU jobseekers will not be able to claim. ‘This is a payment for people who are both in work and out of work, and it’s there to support them and push them along a path that will free them from dependency on the state. ‘It is the end of tax credits, which are hugely expensive and allow bosses to pay wages that workers can’t exist on. It’s a subsidy from the Government for low pay.’ David Cameron, pictured, is expected to make some major announcements during an immigration speech . Mr Cameron has promised new measures to bring immigration under control in his proposed renegotiation of Britain’s relationship with Brussels, and is expected to set out detailed measures in a speech that could come as early as later this week. Universal credit combines income-based jobseeker’s allowance, employment and support allowance, income support, child tax credit, working tax credit and housing benefit in an attempt to simplify the Byzantine welfare system. Crucially, it means it is always worth people’s while to take a job or more hours if they already have one. The Government says that more than 30,000 people have now moved onto universal credit, which is available in more than 60 jobcentres. By Christmas, the scheme will have been extended to nearly 100 jobcentres, predominantly in the North West. Mr Duncan Smith admitted the original 2017 deadline for all claimants to be transferred to the new benefit had been ‘artificial’, and said he made ‘no apologies’ for slowing down its introduction to avoid the sorts of errors that plagued the tax credits system. It is expected to take until 2019 to put all claimants on to the system, though it will apply to all new claimants – including migrants – far sooner. Mr Duncan Smith told MPs the credit would bring £35bn in economic benefits to the UK , and is now being extended to parents for the first time. Today, a report from the National Audit Office cautions that billions of pounds are at risk if the Government fails to stick to its ‘challenging’ timetable for introducing new IT systems to run the universal credit system. Ministers have failed to put contingency plans in place to cope with any setbacks in the digital service being created to deliver payments, it said. The programme is already six months behind schedule and a further six month delay could mean a £2.3 billion loss in the societal benefits expected from people being moved into work and off benefits, it warned. Labour’s Rachel Reeves said universal credit was being introduced at a ‘glacial pace’. The party has said it will review the system if it wins power next May. Miss Reeves will claim today that the Government is set to spend more than £5 billion more on tax credits than it expected over the five years of this Parliament. Labour will blame the overspend - revealed in figures from the House of Commons Library - on rising levels of low pay, which have left more people reliant on in-work benefits. ‘This is yet another example of Tory welfare waste: billions more of taxpayers’ money spent on in-work benefits, 900,000 people waiting for a combined 118,000 years in a huge backlog for sickness and disability benefit assessments. And the shambles of Universal Credit leading to huge delays and over £130 million of taxpayers’ money already wasted on failed IT,’ she will say. A Conservative spokesman said: This is desperate stuff from Labour – the party which let the benefits bill double, including a 340 per cent rise in tax credit spending. What’s more, they’ve opposed every single step we’ve taken to put things right. Our welfare reforms are set to save £50 billion over the course of this Parliament.’","Iain Duncan Smith is planning a  clampdown on benefits for EU nationals .

"Nigel Farage has become a trendsetter after a tie he wore sold out after he was seen wearing it in public. The UKIP leader wore the distinctive Bayeux Tapestry tie during the Rochester by-election last week. However people hoping to copy his look have been left disappointed after it sold out on a number of websites. A silk tie depicting the Bayeux Tapestry sold out after UKIP leader Nigel Farage was spotted wearing it . Some even admitted the lack of supplies was due to the 'Farage effect', suggesting the politician is emulating the likes of celebrities and the Duchess of Cambridge in setting the latest trends. And the tie may have been lucky for the leader as Mark Reckless, who recently defected from the Conservatives to UKIP, won last Thursday's by-election. Asked why he made the particular fashion decision, Mr Farage told the Telegraph: 'It was the last time we were invaded and taken over. 'And there's a Norman keep here [at Rochester Castle]. I was looking through the tie rack this morning, and it seemed a sensible choice to me.' The distinctive silk tie costs £25 from online retailer Fox and Chave, but is now listed as sold out on the website. It is printed with a pattern of the Bayeux Tapestry, which is a cloth that depicts the events leading up to the Norman conquest of England. The silk tie is currently out of stock at Fox and Chave, after Nigel Farage was spotted wearing it on Thursday . Mr Farage wore the tie during the Rochester and Strood by-election when UKIP's Mark Reckless (right) won . The 230ft long work is believed to have been made sometime after the Battle of Hastings in 1066, probably in a monastery. It is also sold by the British Museum for £30. In April the Duchess of Cambridge was seen wearing a yellow dress during the Royal tour of Australia and New Zealand. Sales of yellow items immediately increased by 95 per cent on eBay. A polka dot Topshop dress she wore during her pregnancy had a similar impact, selling out hours after she was seen wearing it. The first written record of the Bayeux Tapestry is in 1476. It was described in the cathedral at Bayeux as 'a very long and narrow hanging on which are embroidered figures and inscriptions comprising a representation of the conquest of England.' The Bayeux Tapestry is thought to have been commissioned in the 1070s by Bishop Odo of Bayeux, half-brother of William the Conqueror. It is over 230 feet (70 metres) and tells the story of the final days of King Harold's encounter with William the Conqueror. The tapestry consists of some fifty scenes with captions embroidered on linen with coloured woollen yarns. Since it was 'rediscovered' by scholars in the 18th Century, its final scene - thought to show the coronation of William - has been missing. According to legend, French revolutionary soldiers took it from the cathedral intending to cut it up to use as wagon covers. In July this year stitchers in Alderney completed the missing final piece of the tapestry. The new tapestry is the same height as the original, with four panels showing events following the Battle of Hastings . A section of the Bayeux Tapestry shows the death of King Harold following the Norman Invasion of 1066 .","Nigel Farage wore distinctive Bayeux Tapestry tie during the by-election .

"Coca-Cola plans to unveil a classic beverage nationwide this December that is a far cry from the sugary soda that made the brand famous. As Americans cut down on unhealthy soft drinks, Coca-Cola has turned to creating a premium type of milk to boost their dwindling profits. Fairlife will be available in stores in late December and boasts 50 per cent more protein and 50 per cent less sugar than regular milk. It also contains 30 per cent more calcium. The added nutritional benefits fatten the price tag and it will cost about double the amount of regular milk. New product: As less and less Americans are buying the sugary soda that Coca-Cola is famous for, the brand has decided to come out with a premium milk product called Fairlife . Coming soon: Fairlife milk will be on shelves starting in late December and will cost twice the price of regular milk because it is supposedly healthier than traditional milk . Fairlife is also lactose free. 'It's basically the premiumization of milk,' Sandy Douglas, a senior vice president at Coca-Cola's North American operation at the Morgan Stanley Global Consumer Conference last week. The company has had success in advertising healthier beverages with their Simply juice line which has done well despite the fruit juice industry starting to slump. Fruit juices are also packed with sugars and are a major contributor along with soft drinks to childhood obesity. CBS reports that Coca-Cola advertises Simlpy juices as being healthier, unsweetened, and never frozen. 'Our ambition there is to create the Simply of milk,' Douglas said of the new product. American shoppers have flocked towards higher protein products like Yogurt and less are buying items with high sugar contents. 'Protein is the fastest-growing segment of the beverage category,' Mike Saint John, president of Coca-Cola North America's Minute Maid business unit, told the Dairy Today. Racy advertisements: Coca-Cola's promotion of the new milk product features women wearing dresses made of milk that cling tightly to their shapely bodies . Dress to drink: In this advertisement for Fairlife a woman wears a dress made of milk that resembles Marilyn Monroe's famous white ensemble . Despite the growing popularity of high protein products, Dairy Today reports that one of every two adults doesn't drink milk at all. Milk sales have also declined by 8 per cent over the last ten years. What Coca-Cola aims to do is advertise how Fairlife is healthier than traditional milk because it's cold-filtered to concentrate protein and remove fat and sugar. Coca-Cola already sells a protein shake called Core Power which goes through the same filtration process. In order to build hype around the new milk, Coca-Cola has developed provocative ads which they launched earlier this year in Minnesota of women wearing dresses made from milk, reports Business Insider. 'Swing into something better,' says one advertisement picturing a woman in a dress made of milk hanging from a swing. 'Milk with flair,' reads another ad picturing a woman in a dress made from milk that resembles an iconic image of Marilyn Monroe in a white dress. Despite the Milk industry being on the decline, Coca-Cola believes that their premium product equipped with a premium price tag will reel in the cash flow. 'Now to be clear, we're going to be investing in the milk business for a while to build the brand so it won't rain money in the early couple of years,' Douglas said at last week's conference. 'But like Simply, when you do it well, it rains money later.' Moove over Coca-Cola: The advertisements for Fairlife not only depict women in milk dresses that cling closely to their bodies, they advertise the health benefits of the product such as more calcium . Body conscious: Coca-Cola hops that Americans concerned about their weight  will purchase Fairlife .","As Americans cut down on unhealthy soft drinks, Coca-Cola has turned to creating a premium type of milk called Fairlife to boost dwindling profits .

"A dog waited for her owner for five months after their Kansas City house exploded, killing a man and critically injuring another in the process. The dog, now named Asha, was left homeless and suffered injuries from the blaze. Her greatest pain was the loss of her owner Wiley Mitchell Jr. for whom she waited five months to return. Investigators say that on June 4, people inside a home on Tennessee Avenue were making illegal fireworks and that's what caused the deadly combustion. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Loyal: Asha waited by her dead owner's house for five months after he died and their home was destroyed . Dead:  52-year-old Wiley Mitchell Jr. died days after the explosion after losing both his legs and one of his arms and Asha lingered by the destroyed property waiting for him to come home . KTLA reports that 52-year-old Wiley Mitchell Jr. died days after the explosion after losing both his legs and one of his arms. Another man was critically injured. Asha was one of the family's three dogs but she was the only one out of the three to survive the blast. She had a willingness to live so that she could be reunited with her owner and she refused to leave the property even when neighbors and animal workers tried to save her numerous times. 'Once the house had exploded, the family never came back because of the tragedy,' The Rescue Project outreach lead Lori lamb said. Destroyed: The Explosion destroyed this Kansas City home and killed 52-year-old Wiley Mitchell JR. and two out of the family's three dogs on June 4 . 'She obviously had the will to live. She had hope to live,' Lamb said. 'That’s the reason why we named her Asha because it stands for hope.' After numerous attempts at rescuing the dog, neighbors called The Rescue project to set up a humane trap to save the mourning pooch. Initial attempts were unsuccessful but thankfully their efforts were not in vain. 'The neighbor called and said she was in the trap,' Lamb said. 'We were ecstatic.' Asha is currently being cared for at the Great Plains SPCA where they are running tests to determine the severity of her injuries which were left untreated for months. After she is nursed back to health, veterinarians will find her a new and loving home. 'We have a lot of people just ready to see that happy ending for Asha,' Great Plains SPCA chief communications officer Rachel Hodgson told KTLA. New home: Once Asha's injuries have healed she will be placed in a new and loving home .","The dog, now named Asha, was left homeless and suffered injuries from a June 4 explosion that killed her owner Wiley Mitchell Jr.

"Five children have perished in a massive fire that destroyed their mobile home - but their parents and little brother managed to escape. The children's father, Johnny Hernandez Jr., 30, was able to push their mother Annabel Ortiz, 32, and two-year-old brother Johnny to safety as the 70-foot mobile home in Edna, Texas was engulfed by flames just after 5am on Tuesday, the Victoria Advocate reported. But the fire claimed the lives of the couple's other children: Noah Ortiz, 15, Nicholas Ortiz, 13, Julian Ortiz, nine, Ariana Hernandez, six and Liliana Hernandez, five. Officials said the children died after the roof of a South Texas mobile home partially collapsed in a fire, making rescue attempts impossible. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: Noah Ortiz, 15, (back center) and his siblings Nicholas, 13, (right) Julian, nine, (left) Ariana, six (front left) and Liliana, five (center) have perished in a fire. Their brother Johnny (front right) survived . Witnesses told Click2Houston that they heard the distraught father shouting 'I tried to get in there! I tried, I tried!' outside the home. 'We're taking it really hard,' the father's brother, Rico Hernandez, told the Advocate. 'It's probably one of the biggest tragedies in Edna, in all around.' The cause of the fire is being investigated, although authorities have said it appears the flames started in the kitchen. 'It was an old trailer so maybe it was something electrical,' Rico Hernandez told the Advocate. 'I'm guessing it was cold last night so something with the heater.' Survivors: The children's parents, Johnny Hernandez, 30, and Annabel Ortiz, 32, also survived the fire . Heartbreaking: The siblings, pictured together, were unable to escape when the home partially collapsed . Photographs taken of the two- or three-bedroom home on Tuesday show it completely burned down. By the time emergency services arrived, it was already completely engulfed in flames. Ortiz was taken to Citizens Medical Center, where she was listed in fair condition. She was treated for a gash to her arm, which she reportedly sustained when her husband pushed her from a window. Her husband and their surviving son did not need medical attention. Hernandez Jr.'s cellphone was found outside the house, the Advocate reported. He had taken photos of his children on Monday night and wanted to make sure he saved the images, his brother said. Destroyed: Firefighters sift through the charred remains of a mobile home where the five children perished . Scene: The 70-foot-long home was completely destroyed by the fire that broke out just after 5am . Questions: Authorities are still looking into what caused the fire at the mobile home in Edna, Texas . 'All of them were just popular, great kids,' Superintendent Robert O'Connor told The L.A. Times. 'It's devastating anytime you lose a child ... but to lose five at a one time, that is unbelievable.' Edna is a town of 5,500 residents about 100 miles southwest of Houston. The high school, where Noah was a starter for the football team, has canceled upcoming sports games and brought in grief counselors across its campuses.","Johnny Hernandez, 30, managed to get Annabel Ortiz, 32, and their two-year-old son, Johnny, out of their burning home on Tuesday morning .

"Authorities in Tanzania have ordered the eviction of 40,000 Masai people so their ancestral home can be turned into a hunting ground for Middle Eastern royals. A 1,500sq/km 'wildlife corridor' around Loliondo, next to the Serengeti national park, will be handed over to a commercial hunting and safari company based in the United Arab Emirates. Activists have accused the government of reneging on a promise after it last year said it had backed down on the plans following intense global public opposition. Ancestral lands: Maasai dancers at sunset in the Loliondo area which the Tanzanian government is planning to sell off to a luxury hunting and safari company, near the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania . Now the Masai have been ordered to quit their traditional lands by the end of the year, with the only change to the original deal being an offer of 1 billion shillings compensation (£369,350) channelled into development projects. Samwel Nangiria, co-ordinator of the local Ngonett civil society group, told The Guardian he feels 'betrayed'. 'One billion is very little and you cannot compare that with land. It’s inherited. Their mothers and grandmothers are buried in that land. There’s nothing you can compare with it,' he said. Tanzania’s prime minister, Mizengo Pinda, is set to meet with Masai representatives in Dodoma on Tuesday. The Maasai are a semi-nomadic tribe inhabiting southern Kenya and northern Tanzania. Their lives centre around their cattle, which are their primary source of food and an important measure of wealth and success. They say the lands around Loliondo are crucial for grazing their livestock, allowing them to maintain their traditional way of life. They insist the sale of the territory will affect the livelihoods of 80,000 people. The lands are to be sold off to the Ortelo Business Corporation (OBC), a luxury game-hunting outfit reportedly set up by an official close to a United Arab Emirates royal family. The company has operated in Loliondo for 20 years, catering to such high profile clients as Prince Andrew and the royal families of Dubai and Abu Dhabi, whose 747s touch down on a private airstrip. Masai children in front of their mud hut: The Masai say the lands around Loliondo are crucial for grazing their livestock, and insist the sale of the territory will affect the livelihoods of 80,000 people . Mr Nangiria says even in recent years police have killed activists opposing the hunting reserve, and he claims he has been threatened by text message and over the phone. In September last year Tanzanian authorities announced the end to a two decade effort to expel the Masai from Loliondo, bowing to 18 months of coordinated protest and a petition signed by more than 1.7million people. The revival of the plans has angered Mr Nagiria. 'The Masai would like to ask the prime minister about the promise.,' said. 'What happened to the promise? Was it a one-year promise or forever? Perhaps he should put the promise in writing.'","1,500sq/km of Masai grazing lands to be sold to UAE game-hunting outfit .

"As businessman Geoffrey Edelsten is chased for millions by the Australian Tax Office and US creditors, it's now been revealed more than $30 million has been 'inexplicably' removed from his private trust account ledgers. The Australian Taxation Office is pursuing the former doctor for $14,130,000 in taxes and penalties and a motion was filed in the US Bankruptcy Court on Friday regarding a secret settlement last month between Mr Edelsten and his creditors, namely Florida's Mawardi family, reported the Daily Telegraph. The ATO says the US trustee liquidating Mr Edelsten's assets showed that it 'disproportionately favours (the) trust' and may have been unaware of $30.9 million in his Norman South Trust as of June, because that amount of money may not have been disclosed before the agreement.

"Thanksgiving is just around the corner, and for many of us that means spending days lounging about with bloated stomachs and nursing hangovers after one too many. But what’s the science behind such over-indulging and why do our bodies feel so full after eating too much? The answer is revealed in a video that explains why too much turkey during the festive period can leave you unable to swallow another morsel of food. Scroll down for video . The video analyses all of the major components of a Thanksgiving dinner - ans shows exactly what they do to our body. The average adult consumes 3,000 calories and 229 grams of fat in one Thanksgiving meal. A 160-pound person would have to run at a moderate pace for four hours, swim for five hours or walk 30 miles to burn off those calories. The video was created by the American Chemical Society’s YouTube channel Reactions. 'The season of giving is often also the season of over-indulging at the dinner table,' it said. 'As Thanksgiving approaches, Reactions takes a look down at our stomachs to find out what happens when you overeat.' They explain that, when you eat a big meal, part of the reason you can feel full is down to the size of your stomach. ‘Your stomach can stretch the volume of about one litre; that’s about the size of a burrito,’ the narrator says. ‘When you eat a big meal you fill your stomach to its limits, squeezing against your other organs and making your abdomen feel, well, full.’ When eating your stomach and intestines also fill with gases, not only from food and drink but also gulps of air when you swallow anything. This additional air adds to the swollen sensation you get after eating. It also reveals how what we drink affects us - and how carbon dioxide in fizzy drinks can be behind the overwhelming urge to belch at the dinner table . In the video on their Reactions page they detail the processes taking place (illustrated) when we over-indulge in certain foods. Our stomach has a finite size and squeezes other organs when it's full . Fizzy drinks can make you feel especially full, as the gas that makes them fizzy - namely carbon dioxide - can fill more space than the liquid it came in. Your body can get rid of this gas though - in the form of burps and other methods that don’t need to be explained. ‘For some people another uncomfortable result of a big meal is heartburn,’ the video continues. In 2012, Robert Lustig, a professor of clinical paediatrics at the University of California, explained a new scientific theory on why people eat too much. He argues that the urge to overeat and lounge around doing nothing is not a sign of weakness. It is, he says, a hormonal issue, triggered by eating too much sugar. He points the finger of blame at the hormone leptin, which acts like an appetite thermostat. As one of two ‘hunger hormones’ in the body, leptin works to decrease the appetite (its partner, ghrelin, increases appetite). When you have had enough to eat, your fat cells release leptin, which effectively dulls the appetite by instructing the brain that it’s time to stop eating. But Professor Lustig warns that our sweet tooth can send this process haywire and, if you are leptin-resistant, food never stops tasting delicious, no matter how much of it you choose to eat. ‘The stomach produces hydrochloric acid to break down food. More food to break down means more acid, which can creep into the oesophagus, leading to that burning feeling.’ Antacid tablets can alleviate this pain using bases, which are at the opposite end of the pH scale, to neutralise the acids. Doing this, however, can release more carbon dioxide and increase the feeling of being full. But it’s not just on a physical level that you can feel full; your brain also sends signals to stop you eating when it thinks you’ve had enough. It releases a hormone called leptin when the amount of fat in your body reaches a certain level, which inhibits hunger. In addition, the video says: ‘When you eat a high-calorie meal, cells in your intestines secrete a hormone called peptide tyrosine-tyrosine, or PYY. ‘When PYY reaches the brain, it binds with receptors that give you the feeling that you’re full. Maybe even a little queasy.’ The video reveals how Thanksgiving can boost our stomach by up to a litre . Ingesting air and gas can also lead to people feeling more bloated, while our brain also sends out hormones to warn us to stop eating when it detects we've got too much fat in our bodies. The bloated feeling will be felt by many come Thanksgiving (stock image shown) Other hormones also have a similar purpose, to get you to stop eating when you’ve had too much. But for some, come Christmas time, there’s simply too much delicious food available for any notice to be given to these hormones. And instead, they’ll be left to deal with the biological repercussions of over-eating.

"Work has got under way to start dismantling the part of Eastbourne Pier left devastated by a fire during the summer. A team of experts using cutting torches were hoisted into position to begin slicing through the steel carcass of the dome-shaped amusement arcade at the front of the Victorian pier. The section, once home to banks of fruit machines, ride-on toys and grabbers, bore the brunt of the fire which left it a scorched shell on July 30. Demolition work of the arcade is expected to take eight weeks, but the front of the Grade II-listed pier will remain open during that time, while the end of it will be off limits while cranes operate. A specialist team of workers used oxygen and propane cutting torches  to begin the process of removing the dome's mangled remains . The historic pier caught fire on July 30 causing extensive damage to the Grade II listed structure as the blaze destroyed an amusement arcade . The RNLI assisted the fire brigade in fighting the blaze by stationing their lifeboat near the pier and helping prevent the fire spreading . The fire on the 144-year-old, 1,000ft-long attraction came at the worst possible time for traders in the East Sussex resort, at the height of the all-important summer tourist season. Traders, some of whom did not have insurance, were told their rent would be waived until the end of the season, and a discount offered on their 2015/16 fees. Up to 80 firefighters tackled the inferno on the attraction, which happened in broad daylight but mercifully resulted in no-one being injured. It was initially suspected that an electrical fault could have caused the blaze on the privately-owned pier, which is run by Cuerden Leisure. But Sussex Police later said they were treating the fire as “suspicious”, leading to the possibility arsonists may have been responsible. No arrests have so far been made. The people of East Sussex have witnessed the devastation of some of their beloved piers before. The top of the dome was badly mangled by the fire, which investigators believe may have been started deliberately by an arsonist . The pier will be closed while heavy cranes remove the large sections of steel from the site in an operation which should take eight weeks . The workers operating on the site have been lifted into place using a large crane, inside a special safety cage . In 2003, the 148-year-old West Pier in Brighton was reduced to a mangled mass of metal by two major blazes within two months. And in Eastbourne’s neighbouring resort of Hastings, the Grade II-listed pier there was almost destroyed in a fire in 2010 following years of neglect by its then-Panama-registered owner. Efforts are now well under way to restoring Hastings Pier by next summer after more than £13 million was secured mainly though the Heritage Lottery Fund. Prime Minister David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne visited Eastbourne in the fire’s aftermath to see the damage as Downing Street pledged up to £2 million to help the town’s tourism industry recover from the pier’s loss. The inferno was so fierce that 20 firefighters remained at the site more than 24 hours after the blaze started. Student Louisa Foley from Eastbourne, posed for a photograph with the blazing inferno in the background before posting it on the internet . Firefighters continued to battle the massive blaze until the following morning when the final flames burned themselves out . Firefighters battled the blaze several different direction, with some officers on the pier itself with others underneath the historic structure and a final group spraying water from the sea. However, at the time of the fire some people were criticised on social media after they took selfie photographs with the blazing pier in the background. One image, featured student Louisa Foley, who posed in a leopard skin bikini, dark sun glasses and large pint-bottle of cider in front of the inferno. Ms Foley is a student at the Leeds College of Art and thought the fire provided the perfect backdrop for a photograph. She described criticism of her photograph as 'ridiculous' and hilarious'. Ms Foley told Leeds student Newspaper The Tab: 'My friend was visiting Eastbourne, where I'm from, so we decided to pop down to the beach. 'We were drinking and enjoying the sun when she asked me if the pier usually has smoke coming from it. 'That's when we realised it was on fire and saw it as a great photo opportunity - it's not exactly something you see every day.' Within days, Ms Foley's image had been viewed more than 1.3 million times on the Imgur website. One Eastbourne local criticised Ms Foley's photograph claiming: 'Really wish people would stop taking pictures of my town's historic landmark burning. So many memories on that pier.' Ms Foley added: 'It's ridiculous. It's a great shame that it's happened as the pier's obviously a great landmark in Eastbourne but at the end of the day there's all kinds of photos throughout history of similar events. 'I think it's hilarious how some people are making assumptions of how I'm a tourist or on my day off from work - why do they care? 'They're making assumptions about my life and who I am, which is none of their business. 'It was literally just two girls on a beach, and we decided to take a few photos. 'Of course the burning pier is the main part of the picture but it's a historic event and we wanted to capture it. It's not like we were the only ones taking photos.' Eastbourne Pier, pictured her in May 1931, was built between 1886 and 1870 and actually moves during bad weather to protect it from storms . The 1,000-foot pier has been an incredibly popular tourist attraction for more than a century and even attracted paddle steamers in the 1930s . Before the fire, the pier featured an amusement arcade, pictured, as well as a theatre, shops and restaurants . Unfortunately, the popular attraction will have to remain closed while the heavy machinery is on the site removing the destroyed dome .","Workers began the slow process of removing the fire-damaged steel from the 144-year-old Eastbourne Pier .

"A popular Xbox game has come under fire after being blighted with technical problems and bugs which fans claim make it impossible to play online. Halo: The Master Chief Collection, which is designed for the Xbox One, has been marred with issues since it was released in the UK two weeks ago. Despite being one of the biggest games to be released on the console this year, developers have been forced to issue dozens of updates as part of attempts to fix the problems. Scroll down for video . Halo: The Master Chief Collection, which is designed for the Xbox One, has been marred with issues since it was released in the UK two weeks ago. The main issues surround the 'multiplayer' function of the game . The main issues are said to revolve around the online gaming aspect of Halo, where players can access a multiplayer function to battle against each other. Halo: The Master Chief Collection, which costs about £40, comprises of all the Halo titles which have been released since the original Xbox came out in 2001. The previous titles have been digitally upgraded so they are compatible with the new Xbox One, which costs in the region of £329.99. 343 Industries, the Microsoft-owned developer of Halo, said numerous updates have been released to try and resolve the problems but said ‘far too many’ players remain affected. Today, Bonnie Ross, the founder of 343 industries, issued a heartfelt apology to fans for the issues surrounding the game. In a blog post, she wrote: ‘On Nov 11 we released Halo: The Master Chief Collection. The goal being to create a tribute to Halo fans around the world, and to celebrate the Master Chief’s debut on Xbox One. ‘With the initial release of Halo: The Master Chief Collection, however, we have not delivered the experience you deserve. I personally apologise for this on behalf of us all at 343 Industries. Our team is committed to working around the clock until these issues are resolved. ‘While our team works on continual improvements and towards solutions, my commitment to you is that we will take care of all owners of Halo: The Master Chief Collection. ‘Our primary and continued focus is first on fixing the issues at hand. Once we’ve done that, we will detail how we will make this right with our fans.’ Ms Ross also announced that multiple content updates would be issued over the coming weeks as part of desperate attempts to fix the problems. The collection, which costs about £40, comprises of all the Halo titles which have been released since  2001 . Bonnie Ross, founder of 343 Industries, has personally apologised for the issues and vowed to get them fixed . She said: ‘On the matchmaking front, we have encountered unexpected issues that were not apparent in our internal test environment and that have resulted in a frustrating experience, including long matchmaking times and low session success rates. ‘Within 343 Industries and Xbox, I can assure you that resolving these issues is our #1 priority (sic). ‘We continue to partner with the Xbox platform team to analyse all data to make ongoing server-side adjustments to continually improve the matchmaking experience. ‘We are also preparing additional content updates that will address existing campaign, UI, and other issues to improve the overall experience. ‘With each update we will carefully analyse data to confirm that the improvements we’re seeing internally are also happening with fans at home. ‘Know that we’re trying to be as nimble as possible to put fixes in place. We are planning multiple server-side tweaks and game content updates over the coming weeks.’ She said the next release would come later in the week before adding: ‘Please accept my heartfelt apologies for the delay and for the negative aspects of your experience to date. ‘We’re doing everything in our power to resolve it as quickly as possible.’ Earlier this month, Phil Spencer, the head of Microsoft’s Xbox division, took to Twitter to apologise for the issues after receiving a barrage of criticism from fans. He wrote: ‘Sorry about the issues. I know our fans expect more from us. Team is making progress but I know it’s still disappointing.’ However, his tweet was later deleted. Halo: The Master Chief Collection was billed as the ultimate package which would allow players to enjoy all four Halo games on the Xbox One. Players would take on the role of cyborg soldiers and have access to more than 100 multiplayer maps on which their virtual character could battle against others.","Halo: The Master Chief Collection blighted with technical issues and bugs .

"It doesn’t matter how many steps you record on a fitness tracker, if your posture is poor you could be doing more harm than good. The Arki wristband has been designed to not only monitor activity levels, but also help wearers improve their stance and walking style. It uses machine learning technology to analyse a users’ posture, while haptic feedback gives the wearer immediate prompts to stop them slouching or leaning. Scroll down for video . The £60 Arki wristband (pictured) has been designed to not only monitor activity levels, but also help wearers improve their posture and range of movement. It uses machine learning technology to analyse a users’ walking posture, while haptic feedback gives the wearer immediate prompts to stop slouching or leaning . Elsewhere, Arki is, a fully functional fitness tracker and has biometric authentication features. For example, once it has learnt a person’s walking style it knows when a different person is wearing the device. It can then use the person’s style as a password to get access to the device and its data. Prices for a basic band start at $99 (£63). Arki is dubbed a walking coach and was created by Zikto, which has offices in Los Angeles and Seoul. Real-time haptic feedback gives the wearer prompts to improve their posture, and all the data is gathered and analysed using a smartphone app which provides a Sound Walking Score. Arki additionally has a Body Balance Analysis tool that identifies physical imbalances . Do you spend hours hunched over your phone? Do you also suffer from neck and back pain? If so, the two may well be related. New research has found that slumping to read a text or study a selfie can put undue pressure on the neck, leading to a sore back. This is because bending the neck increases the pressure put on the spine. Bending the head at a 60 degree angle to look at a phone screen puts 60 lbs - or 27kg - worth of pressure on the cervical spine, the part of the spine above the shoulders, the study found. At more than four stone in weight, that is heavier than the average seven year old. Its Kickstarter campaign surpassed its initial target of $100,000 (£64,000) just 13 days following its launch earlier this month, and bands are expected to ship internationally in January. ‘Arki takes wearable fitness technology one step further,’ explained the firm. ‘First-generation fitness wearables track the quantity of users’ movement, serving the valuable purpose of getting people moving. ‘Arki, however, tracks not only the quantity but the quality of movement.’ Arki uses machine learning technology to analyse a users’ walking posture to detect poor walking habits and styles. Real-time haptic feedback gives the wearer prompts to improve their posture, and all the data is gathered and analysed using a smartphone app which provides a Sound Walking Score. Arki additionally has a Body Balance Analysis tool that identifies physical imbalances, by swapping the wristband from left wrist to right, or vice versa once a week or month. It then creates a personalised body map. Arki even suggests personalised exercises, as recommended by professionals, to help users boost their balance.

"Cameron appointed Joanna Shields, a former managing director of Facebook in Europe, to the Lords . David Cameron has long faced criticism over how he has made Downing Street far too close to internet giants since he became Prime Minister. In summer, the concerns reached fever pitch when he appointed Joanna Shields, a former managing director of Facebook in Europe, to the Lords. Despite the fact that the firm has avoided paying its UK taxes, there is even speculation that she could one day be granted a ministerial role. The appointment deepened concerns that the Conservatives are too close to firms such as Facebook and Google and that they have the ear of the government on sensitive topics. Facebook is a US-based social network company set up by Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg in 2004. Its UK arm is based in Covent Garden, and focuses mainly on advertising sales. Miss Shields had a long history in internet firms. She was the managing director of Google in Europe and Africa until 2006, and then chief executive of Bebo, another social networking site. She then went on to take the helm at Facebook, where she was managing director of the company’s European wing between 2008 and 2012 – around the time that the firm was accused of avoiding tax. Facebook UK only paid a small amount of corporation tax in 2011 – much lower than experts said would be expected. And in 2012, Facebook paid zero corporation tax in the UK. It was one of a number of global firms accused of registering subsidiary companies in low-tax countries to avoid paying their full British tax obligations. Facebook UK filed a pre-tax loss of £2.4million on turnover of only £34.6million, despite estimated ad revenues of £223million. The company pushed much of its revenues through a complex scheme in Ireland. At the time, the chairwoman of the powerful Commons public accounts committee called it ‘deliberate manipulation of accounts’. And last month, it emerged that Facebook had not paid any corporation tax in the UK for a second year in a row, despite recording sales of £50million in 2013. Despite the controversy over the firm’s tax affairs, Miss Shields was unveiled in 2012 as Mr Cameron’s digital adviser and chief executive of the government’s ‘Tech City’ to help boost internet start-ups in east London. The dual US and British national is a non-executive director of the London Stock Exchange. She also sits on Boris Johnson’s ‘smart board’ which aims to establish London as Europe’s digital capital. In August, Miss Shields was raised to the Lords – prompting Labour MP John Mann to say: ‘This is showing two fingers to every taxpaying business and taxpayer in the country, and it’s a green light to tax avoiders.’ Facebook says it always pays tax according to the laws of each country. Last month, Mr Cameron pledged tough actions to force companies such as Facebook – along with Google, Starbucks and Amazon – to meet their full UK tax obligations. ‘We’ve cut the rate of corporation tax down to 20 per cent, we’re the most competitive place to come and start a business, but here’s the deal – if they have a low tax rate, those companies have damn well got to pay it.’ But some will question whether the government, which has such close links to these firms, will really apply the required pressure. The Tories are even closer to Google, which has also been accused of avoiding tax. Their bosses enjoy regular access to senior ministers, while some Conservative employees have taken jobs with the company. For example, Rachel Whetstone, Google’s global head of communications, is a close friend of the Camerons and is married to Steve Hilton, the Prime Minister’ s ex-policy chief. And Naomi Gummer, a former adviser to Jeremy Hunt when he was Culture Secretary, is now a public policy analyst at Google.","Cameron appointed former Facebook head Joanna Shields to Lords .

"A baker claims she has cooked the world's biggest mince pie after it weighed in at two stone and containing 56,140 calories - 22 times the recommended daily calorie intake for a man. Charlotte Shaw, 40, of Lottie Shaw's bakery in Elland, near Halifax, West Yorkshire, created the festive favourite using 12.5kg of mincemeat and 1.5kg of sweet pastry. She designed a custom-made reinforced steel tray to produce the pie, which measured a monstrous 27-inches - the same size as a typical four by four tyre. Charlotte Shaw pictured with the finished product that was 27-inches in diameter, the same size as a typical four-by-four tyre . A baker laying out the 1.5kg of traditional sweet pastry in the custom-made reinforced steel tray . Charlotte said: 'It is 27 inches which is massive and probably about the equivalent of a large tyre. It took about an hour to cook - it normally takes 23 minutes. It is huge. 'We think we have we have made the world's biggest mince pie that actually looks like a mince pie. 'It has got the star cut out on top too just as we would with our normal sized pies - only difference is this 100 times bigger.' The giant pie had to be transported around the bakery from machine to machine by six people due to its size. The mincemeat filling alone weighed in at 12.5 kg, just shy of two stone and the traditional sweet pastry, a family recipe of Charlotte's, added another 1.5kg. One of the largest mince pies ever made was an 18-feet-long pie, baked in three separate tins, at Prestatyn, in 2007, in an rectangular shape. However, Charlotte and her bakers were able to make a giant version that looks more like the traditional circular mince pie. The finished product was a 27-inch diameter mine pie - the same size as a typical 4x4 tyre. Six people were needed to carry it around the bakery because of its size. The mincemeat filling weighs 12.5kg, just shy of two stone. Normal pies contain just 30g of mincemeat. The traditional sweet pastry was 1.5kg . The pie contains a massive 56,140 calories . To do this Charlotte had to have a reinforced custom-made steel tray designed to hold the pie and this was then covered with foil to ensure it retained its shape. Charlotte said: 'We had a local steel manufacturing company make us the tin. We couldn't find foil big enough to hold or cover the pie. So we used this steel tin to replicated the foil and hold it in place. It was just far too heavy for foil. So we worked with the local business to achieve this.' Once Charlotte had the tin made, it was foiled and then lined with silicon grease proof paper before the 1.5kg of pastry were rolled out using a commercial rolling pin called a pastry brake machine. She added: 'It was then rolled over the pin, although it was rather heavy, and then carefully put inside the tin. Because it was so big we had to do it with the pastry brake.' The bakers then put 12.5 kg of mincemeat inside the pastry case and cut by hand a 27 inch lid of pastry in the shape of a star and carefully slid it atop the pie. A total of six bakers were needed to move the massive mince pie around the kitchen in Elland, near Halifax, West Yorkshire . Baker Charlotte Shaw said the only difference between the record breaking pie and their traditional festive favourite is the size, 'it is 100 times bigger,' she said . Normal sized mince pies usually contain just 30 grams of mincemeat. Charlotte said: 'We had to cut the lid on a box because we couldn't transport it easily. It was just huge. 'The scariest bit was probably waiting to find out that we had cooked it enough and that it didn't have a soggy bottom!' However the pie isn't just for decoration, Lottie Shaw's bakery will be donating to the pie to their local Forget Me Not Children's Hospice who have been working with the Huddersfield Giants Rugby team. She said: 'We are donating it for a good cause. I don't know if they will be auctioning it off to the rugby players or putting on a charity event to see how much these rugby players can eat of it - we know they have high calorie diets but I am not sure if they could stomach 60,000. Or maybe everyone at the hospice will get to eat it.' She added: 'We wanted to do something fun for the run up to Christmas - everyone loves a mince. We sell four for £2.85. But we thought, how about a giant mince pie! We also wanted to do something good for a local charity!'","The giant mince pie has been created by Lottie Shaw's bakery in Elland .

"A probe into whether a controversial police and crime commissioner was properly insured during a car crash has been widened amid claims an investigating officer was obstructed. Ann Barnes, who earns £85,000-a-year as Kent's crime tsar, was driving her Mercedes sports car when she was involved in a collision in Dartford two months ago. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is already probing whether she committed a criminal offence by not having proper insurance to cover business use of her own car. But today the police watchdog said its team is now examining whether a police officer was 'obstructed in the execution of their duty' when initial inquiries into her insurance cover were being made by her force, Kent Police. Fresh investigation: The Independent Police Complaints Commission has said it will consider if a police officer was 'obstructed in the execution of their duty' after Ann Barnes crashed her Mercedes, pictured . New probe: Kent PCC Ann Barnes, pictured with battle bus 'Ann Force One', is being probed over whether she was properly insured in a crash . Mrs Barnes’s latest troubles began on September 16 when her soft-top Mercedes crashed into another car and then a tree as she drove to a meeting in Dartford. She suffered only minor injuries and later tweeted: ‘Not feeling too bright today, but OK.’ If Mrs Barnes is prosecuted on a charge of driving without insurance, she could be fined £300 and hit with six penalty points on her licence. An IPCC spokesman said: 'The IPCC is investigating whether the police and crime commissioner for Kent, Ann Barnes, may have committed a criminal offence by not having in place appropriate insurance to cover business use of her own car when she was involved in a road traffic accident on 16 September 2014. 'The investigation will also determine how long the relevant insurance was not in place, if that is the case, and how many miles the PCC travelled on business use while uninsured. 'The IPCC is also investigating whether a police constable was obstructed in the execution of their duty when initial inquiries into the PCC's insurance cover were being made by Kent Police.' The office for Mrs Barnes, who was shaken but uninjured in the crash, said no comment would be made on the latest update from the IPCC until after its investigation had ended. Ann Barnes has faced calls to resign and has at times been widely ridiculed since she took office in 2012. Her first major gaffe came when she appointed Paris Brown, then aged 17, as Britain's first youth crime commissioner. But Paris Brown later resigned from the £15,000-a-year job after making offensive comments on her Twitter feed. She wrote the offensive messages on her personal Twitter account, which also included boasts about her sex life, violence, drinking binges and drugs. In trouble: Kent Police and Crime Commissioner Ann Barnes with her 'Onion' diagram explaining police priorities, but when asked to explain what it meant she said: 'Oh God, I've got no idea' Repeat: The Cutting Edge documentary producer also asked her to name crimes towards the outer rings of the onion and again said, 'no idea' Pressure: The storm over the documentary culminated in a rented plane flying over Maidstone, where she works, dragging a banner reading '#annbarnesout - resign'. Then later Miss Brown's replacement was temporarily suspended over allegations of a relationship with a married former councillor. On her documentary: 'The only reason I agreed to do the documentary was to help people better understand the role of police and crime commissioner. It is very complex and there are lots of challenges. Unfortunately I don't think the programme did that and I'm deeply sorry'. When asked about  her job:'Oh dear, what is a police commissioner? Right, well it's not . the Police Commissioner, it's the Police and Crime Commissioner. 'It's . a strange job because there is actually no description at all - there . are certain responsibilities you have to do, but there is no actual job . description.' On . what her 'Crime Onion' meant: 'Oh God, I've got no idea - I can't tell . you actually - I wasn't thinking I'd be talking about the actual onion . (the concentric circles) as we call it - umm I don't know know really - . everything's important.' On . her Ann Force One battle bus: 'My budget is £317million, £15,000 is . money well spent - I could have had a top of range Mercedes, but it's . not my image.' Mrs Barnes was then seen driving her personal Mercedes. On resignation of Paris Brown: 'I was not recruiting an angel. I was not recruiting a police officer. I was recruiting a young person, warts and all. It is personally sad for Paris and her family' In June Mrs Barnes said she was 'deeply sorry' for her 'toe-curling' appearance on a fly-on-the-wall television documentary about her job - but refused to quit. She was filmed saying she had 'no idea' what her taxpayer-funded job entailed in an hour-long Channel Four show branded a 'disaster from start to finish'. Mrs Barnes was widely criticised for her performance on Meet The Police Commissioner where she was compared to David Brent and accused of making Kent Police a 'laughing stock'. The storm culminated in a rented plane flying over Maidstone, where she works, dragging a banner reading '#annbarnesout - resign'. The documentary, aired on May 29, showed Mrs Barnes travelling in a van she dubs 'Ann Force 1 and bringing her dogs into the office. In one clip Mrs Barnes was seen drawing an onion in an attempt to explain what types of crime Kent Police prioritises. But when asked what the rings meant she said: 'Oh God, I've got no idea - I can't tell you actually - I wasn't thinking I'd be talking about the actual onion (the concentric circles) as we call it - umm I don't know know really - everything's important.' She is then asked: 'So what would be an example of the kind of crime on the outside of that ring?', to which she replies that he had 'no idea'. The documentary, aired on May 29, showed Mrs Barnes travelling in a van she dubs 'Ann Force 1' and bringing her dogs into the office. She said: 'My budget is £317million, £15,000 is money well spent - I could have had a top of range Mercedes, but it's not my image.' Turned sour: Ann Barnes appointed Paris Brown as Britain's first youth crime commissioner but she resigned after it emerged she boasted about her sex life, violence, drinking binges and drugs online . But later in the documentary she then pulled up at her office in her top of the range soft-top Mercedes. In one scene she was also filmed painting her 'flaky nails'.","Ann Barnes' soft-top Mercedes collided with another car and a tree .

"Save the Children has been hit by a furious backlash from its own staff for giving a high-profile award to Tony Blair. Nearly 200 employees have signed a letter condemning the decision to give the former Prime Minister a ‘global legacy award’ as ‘morally reprehensible’ and ‘a betrayal’ of the charity’s principles. Mr Blair was presented with the award – for the last Labour government’s aid spending – by the charity’s US arm at a star-studded ceremony in New York last week. Scroll down for video . Celeb bash: Former prime minister Tony Blair speaks on stage at the second annual Save The Children Illumination Gala at the Plaza Hotel in New York City after he is awarded the charity's 'global legacy award' Looking sharp: Mr Blair (left) rubbed shoulders with Hollywood royalty including Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner (right) as guest of honour at the star-studded event . But dozens of staff have signed a petition saying the award ‘endangers our credibility’ and calling for it to be withdrawn. The letter demands a review of the charity’s decision-making process which led to the award being given to Mr Blair. Extracts of the letter published by The Guardian stated: ‘We consider this award inappropriate and a betrayal to Save the Children’s founding principles and values. 'Management staff in the region were not communicated with nor consulted about the award and were caught by surprise with this decision.’ The award renewed the focus on links between senior figures in the charity and Mr Blair. Save the Children’s UK chief executive is Justin Forsyth, who worked as an adviser for Mr Blair for three years and then for Gordon Brown. Jonathan Powell, who was Mr Blair’s chief of staff, is on the board of directors of Save the Children International. One of the charity’s senior managers sent an email last week commenting on the backlash, and admitting the charity had received a ‘high volume of complaints and negative reactions’ regarding the award. Global media manager Krista Armstrong accepted that Mr Blair was a ‘hugely controversial and divisive figure in many parts of the world’. She also listed questions received by outraged staff members asking why Save the Children would hand out one of its most prestigious awards ‘to a man accused of being a war criminal’. Hero dog: Lassie, or rather her latest incarnation, was also among the guests at the sumptuous gala event . Star-studded bash: (From left) Mr Blair, Mike Bezos of the Bezos Family Foundation, actress Dakota Fanning, and Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Nicholas Kristof at the event in New York . Two former aides of Tony Blair have significant roles in Save the Children. Poverty adviser to Blair: Justin Forsyth . Justin Forsyth, who worked in Downing Street from 2004 to 2010, is chief executive of Save the Children UK. And 12 months ago, Jonathan Powell, Mr Blair’s chief of staff throughout his time in power, was appointed to the board of Save the Children International. Mr Forsyth was recruited by Mr Blair to work in Downing Street as an adviser on poverty and climate change. He worked on the Government’s aid agenda, including the Make Poverty History campaign. Mr Forsyth worked for Oxfam before entering No 10, and stayed on after Mr Blair left as Gordon Brown’s director of strategic communications and campaigns. Jonathan Powell, former chief of staff . He was appointed as Save the Children UK’s chief executive soon after the General Election in September 2010. Mr Forsyth attracted controversy two years ago when Save the Children UK warned some parents in the UK could not afford hot meals and shoes for their children. The Tories accused him of turning the charity into a political organisation. His pay packet was also criticised last year when it emerged he was paid £163,000 a year. It has since fallen to £140,000. As Mr Blair’s chief of staff, Mr Powell was among his most senior advisers, and played a key role in the Northern Ireland peace process. Mr Blair was presented with the award last Wednesday at an ‘Illumination Gala’ at the Plaza Hotel in New York. The ceremony’s guest of honour hobnobbed with Hollywood stars including Ben Affleck, Jennifer Garner and Dakota Fanning. He was praised for his ‘leadership on international development’ and the charity pointed to two major summits on debt relief for poor countries during his premiership. Accepting the award, Mr Blair said: ‘From the beginning of humankind there has been brutality, conflict, intrigue, the destructive obsession with a narrow self-interest. ‘But throughout all human history, never has been extinguished that relentless, unquenchable desire to do good. To act not only in self-interest and sometimes to even to act in defiance of it.’ Mr Blair set Britain on course to meet its target of spending 0.7 per cent of national income on aid. But critics of the ballooning aid budget – which hit £11.4billion last year – say the target is arbitrary, warn huge increases in spending will lead to waste, and point out that money is going to India, a country with its own space programme. Much of the opposition to Mr Blair centres on his decision to take Britain to war in Iraq. But his consultancy work for the autocratic President of Kazakhstan has led to opposition leaders in the former Soviet state saying he has ‘blood on his hands’. Mr Blair is said to have earned millions of pounds advising Nursultan Nazarbayev, who has ruled the former Soviet republic since 1989, on how to ‘spin’ a massacre of civilians by his regime. Last night a Save the Children spokesman said: ‘Contrary to some reports, the award was not awarded by Save the Children UK or Justin Forsyth, its UK CEO. It was given to Tony Blair last week by Save the Children US at their gala event in New York. ‘He received the award because of his work on Africa and poverty when Prime Minister. He led the G8 nations at Gleneagles to agree a doubling of aid to Africa, debt cancellation and universal access to Aids treatment. ‘In a global organisation like ours of thousands of people, our staff have strong views on a whole range of issues and people and we respect that diversity of views.’ In a lengthy criticism of The Guardian posted on the website of The Office of Tony Blair last night, a spokesman said: ‘The award was in recognition of Tony Blair’s work in leading G8 nations at Gleneagles in 2005 to pledge to double aid to Africa and provide 100 per cent debt relief to eligible countries, as well as his ongoing work in partnership with African governments through his Foundation, the Africa Governance Initiative (AGI). ‘It is extraordinary that while ignoring the body of work undertaken by Tony Blair, the AGI and the people they work alongside in African governments . . . the article also sought to traduce the reputation of Save the Children, and was neither balanced nor fair.’","Nearly 200 employees sign letter condemning decision to give him award .

The Purefresh toilet seat is designed to neutralise and mask unpleasant smells as quickly as possible. A battery-powered fan draws air through a deodorising carbon filter, which is integrated into the seat. It hums quietly as it moves the air over a scent pack, which fragrances the neutralised air with a more pleasant aroma such as fresh laundry or 'avocado spa'. The carbon filter lasts for up to six months, while the scent packs must be refreshed monthly. The seat also contains two LED light settings to help people find their way to the toilet in the dark. A light illuminates the toilet tank when the lid is down, but once it is lifted up, it lights up the bowl. Josh Pantel, 27, has a Purefresh seat in the Middleton home he bought three months ago with his girlfriend, who works for Kohler. ‘If you have a visitor or someone at your place, it makes them feel more comfortable using the restroom,’ he says. The seat has a light to illuminate the bowl when lifted to make it easier for people to use in the night. Kohler is not the first US company to make a no-smell seat. San Francisco-based Brondell introduced one in 2006 but pulled it from the market about three years ago because the manufacturing costs were high and demand ‘wasn't where we had hoped it would be,’ according to the company's president, Steve Scheer. His company now includes deodorising technology similar to Kohler's on its $600 (£382) Swash 1000 bidet seats. ‘Personally, I kind of view (deodorising) more as an extra than as a core reason to buy the product,’ Mr Scheer said, before conceding that the market for specialty toilet seats is growing. Kohler also makes heated seats and versions that glow so people can find their way to a toilet in the dark.","Purefresh’ seat has a hidden fan that sucks in air and pushes it through an odour-eating carbon filter, before adding a more pleasant scent .

"The winner of Australia's Ugliest Living Room has been crowned, but luckily for the owners their prize came in the form of a complete makeover for the unattractive space. What used to be a crowded, outdated and completely mismatched room in the house has been transformed into a bright and modern area perfect for entertaining or relaxing. Nabila Jouni’s living space in their Guilford, NSW, home is completely unrecognisable thanks to a $10,000 overhaul by online homewares retailer TheHome.com.au. Before: Nabila Jouni's living room was cluttered, outdated and in desperate need of a makeover . After: The space is brighter, more modern and appears much more spacious . Originally it was her son Sam who entered Nabila's house in the running, revealing his mother was too embarrassed to entertain even her own family in the living room. 'My parents have struggled to pay off their mortgage for the past 16 years, leaving no money to fix up our home. 'All my mother wants is to have an entertaining area to cater to her children and grandchildren without being embarrassed. She deserves this,' Sam wrote in his touching entry. Before the makeover Nabila's living room featured bold green checkered couches, outdated wallpaper, cluttered corners and knick-knacks piled into every corner. Before the makeover the room was crowded and full of green checkered couches . Now the space looks larger, and is filled with simpler furniture in an updated colour scheme . Nabila, pictured here with husband Elias, said she loves her new lounge room too much to pick just one piece that is her favourite . There was a faded rug, ancient blinds on the windows, and pictures covering all the walls. Now the room is full of vibrant colours, much more modern furniture and looks much more spacious than it previously did. Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Nabila described the makeover as 'beautiful' and expressed her gratitude for the helping hand renovating her home. 'I just want to say thank you to everyone and I'm really glad that my son entered us in the competition,' she said. The winner also revealed how happy the new space makes her feel and the new living room provides a great starting point for renovating the rest of her home. The living space used to feature faded floral wallpaper over a pale pink paint job . Now the whole theme of the room is based around the powder blue colour on the walls . Stylist Emma Bloomfield said she designed the room to have a Scandinavian feel about it . When asked whether she had a favourite piece in the newly transformed space, Nabila said it was too difficult to choose just one. 'To tell you the truth I love it all together.' 'It makes me feel good, and thankful for him (her son Sam)', she revealed. Nabila also revealed she looks forward to entertaining her family in the living room, but added there was a lot of them so it still might be a bit of a squeeze. Emma Bloomfield, stylist from TheHome.com.au helped create the transformation, said the concept for the whole room began with the colour of the walls. 'I made up a mood board and the first thing we decided was a paint colour and it all stemmed from there,' Ms Bloomfield told Daily Mail Australia. The Jounis, pictured before the makeover, will now renovate the rest of their house around the new room . Next on their list to tackle is the kitchen, but Nabila said the new living room gave them a great head start . 'We wanted the wall to be not the average beige colour that people tend to go,' she added, before saying she wanted to room to have a Scandinavian feel to it. The owners moved all of the old furniture out and packed up their own possessions so nothing was lost, and in order to make room for the painters from Haymes Paint. Once that was completed it was simply 'a matter of assembling the furniture'. 'The rug is one of my favourite pieces as well as the artwork above the smaller grey couch,' Ms Bloomfield revealed. 'And the floating shelf, the main idea behind doing that was so that we could display the family photos Nabila had. 'She had photos everywhere and we knew it was important to her to incorporate that into the room.'","The title of Australia's Ugliest Living Room was awarded to Nabila Jouni .

"No, God didn't reveal himself to this Chinese man in a vision. But it seems Lu Zhenghai has been reading about the Mayan prophecy that predicts the end of the world on December 21. He is so afraid of the rumours he has spent his whole life savings trying to build his very own apocalypse-proof 'Noah's Ark'. Race for survival: One Chinese man is so convinced the world will end next month he is building his very own Noah's Ark (pictured) The vessel, which has cost him ¥1million (£100,000), measures 21.2m long, 15.5m wide, 5.6m high and displaces about 140 tons of water. Lu, from Urumqi, Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, admits it's not much to look at, but is confident it will serve its purpose. Scientists and researchers are going out of their way to assure people that December 21, 2012, the so-called Mayan end-date, will not bring about the end of the world. But that hasn't stopped some from ploughing on with their own safety measures regardless. Faith: Lu has spent his whole life savings of £100,000 on the boat, which he believes will save him from an impending global disaster . Not quite biblical proportions: The vessel measures 21.2m long, 15.5m wide, 5.6m high and displaces about 140 tons of water . Work in progress: Lu, from Urumqi, Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, admits it's not much to look at, but is confident it will serve its purpose . In France, the authorities have been . forced to ban access to a sacred mountain, rumoured to be a haven from . the apocalypse, because hordes of believers have been flocking to the . region in recent weeks. Legend . has it that the Pic de Bugarach in south-west France will burst open on . that day revealing an alien spaceship which will carry nearby humans to . safety. A hundred police . and firefighters will also control approaches to the tiny village of the . same name at the foot of the mountain, and if too many people turn up, . they will block access there, too. Doomsday refuge: The Pic de Bugarach, south-west France, where some believe an alien spacecraft will burst out taking humans away from an apocalypse . Expectations: With the Aztec Mayan calendar, pictured, ending on or around December 21 some fear it means the people believed it to be the end of the world . The significance of December 21, 2012, stems from interpretations of the Maya Long Count calendar, which is made up of 394-year periods called baktuns. Experts estimate the system starts counting at 3114 BC and will have run through 13 baktuns, or 5,125 years, around that day. However, experts say that while 13 was a significant number for the Maya, the end of that cycle would be a milestone — but not an end. Geoffrey Braswell, an anthropologist at the University of California at San Diego, said: 'The Maya long count system is like a car odometer. 'My first car (odometer) only had six wheels so it went up to 99,999.9 miles. 'That didn't mean the car would explode after reaching 100,000 miles.' As the clock winds down to December 21, experts on the Maya calendar have been racing to convince people that the Maya didn't predict an apocalypse for the end of this year. Some experts are now saying the Maya may indeed have made prophecies, just not about the end of the world. Archaeologists, anthropologists and other experts met in September in the southern Mexico city of Merida to discuss the implications of the Maya Long Count calendar, which some interpret as signalling the end of the world on December 21. Meanwhile, only a couple of references to the 2012 date equivalency have been found carved in stone at Maya sites and neither refers to an apocalypse, experts say. Such apocalyptic visions have been common for more than 1,000 years in Western, Christian thinking, and are not native to Maya thought. Experts stressed that the ancient Maya, whose 'classic' culture of writing, astronomy and temple complexes flourished from the year 300AD to 900AD, were extremely interested in future events, far beyond December 21.","Lu Zhenghai splashes out £100,000 on disaster-proof vessel .

"A collection of weird and wonderful postcards dating back to 1900 show the Victorians were not far off in predicting the future of travel in the 21st century. While most of the ideas remain totally unachievable in the modern world, some of the concepts are not dissimilar to the lives we lead today. The moving pavement is one that we can credit the Victorians for - just about every airport now has travelators, and even a break to the North Pole  isn't too far from reality, as more and more people begin to venture further afield for a more adventurous holiday. It may not quite be mainstream yet, but trips to the North Pole are taken on my some explorers as we seek to broaden our knowledge . Ships that can go out to sea and then transform into a wheeled vehicle to carry on land are yet to make an appearance . Travel on boats with glass lookouts that go underwater - the nearest we have is submarines . The 12 drawings are based on predictions made in 1900 as to how the world would look 100 years on, and they leave little to the imagination. Among the warped ideas are moveable houses, undersea ships and even a roofed city, each illustrated with a suitably unrealistic picture of how the idea would play out. However, a good weather machine remains as much of a pipe dream as it did a century ago, and people seem happier to travel by commercial aeroplane rather than an individual flying machine. Moveable brick/stone houses and buildings might not be quite right, but we do have mobile homes . Hot air balloon rides to travel the world have been somewhat superseded by aeroplanes and trains . The postcards were the idea of Theodore Hildebrand and Son - a German chocolate company - pictured here is a weather machine . A walled city, as predicted by the Victorians, might not work in this days and age with pollution from fumes being the biggest worry . But, in an era that invented the telephone, the light bulb and even the first ceramic toilet, the Victorians appear to have had a fairly good insight into what the future had to offer. The postcards were the idea of Theodore Hildebrand and Son - a German chocolate company who decided to get in on the future-telling business with a crafty marketing campaign. For a short time, they slipped the colourful cards depicting theoretical life in the year 2000 into boxes of their sweets, predicting how a range of activities would be upgraded for the 21st Century. This scene is not too dissimilar to us using paragliders and handgliders to get around and explore the landscape . Individual water travel was predicted by the Victorians, but this hasn't exactly taken off . Moving walkways to get around were predicted by the Victorians, and these are seen today in many of our airports . The Victorians looked ahead to how our states would be policed as well as how we would travel the world . The postcards predicted what life would be like in the year 2000 .","Predictions of trips to the North Pole and 'moving walkways' fit with the modern day .

"Former Premier League footballer Clarke Carlisle discussed his failed suicide attempt with Absolute Radio's Jon Champion in what was his first radio appearance since leaving hospital. Carlisle, who jumped in front of a lorry on December 22, has revealed he was 'disgusted' with himself after trying to commit suicide. An emotional Carlisle has admitted he told his family members he still 'did not want to be here' while they visited him in Leeds General Infirmary. A tearful Clarke Carlisle wipes his eyes during the interview with Absolute Radio's Jon Champion . Carlisle was incredibly emotional as he reflected on his failed suicide attempt . Speaking to Champion, Carlisle said: 'I was only in LGI for three days and throughout those three days my family were coming to see me. 'Every time I came and felt unconditional love. It was just another point of self loathing. I was disgusted with myself and I said I have to be honest with you ""I still do not want to be here"". 'And that disgusted me even more. Because these are the people who are coming to love me and care for me. And I'm telling them that in spite of that I want to be dead.' Carlisle also revealed he would have been sectioned if he rejected the chance of attending a psychiatric hospital. Carlisle admitted in an interview with The Sun that he tried to kill himself by jumping in front of a lorry . The 35-year-old former footballer played for QPR (left) and Burnley (right) during his playing days . He added: 'They discharged me and said ""Clarke will you go to a psychiatric hospital?"" And I said ""If I say no then what will happen?"" and they replied ""then we will put you in a psychiatric hospital"". 'So I would have been sectioned, so I said ""yes I will go"". For the first five days in there I didn't leave my room. 'I'm sitting there thinking what on earth am I doing in a psychiatric hospital. Not that I didn't want to be there but that I was taking up bed space for someone who needed to be helped.' Carlisle, who has been diagnosed with recurrent complex depressive disorder, concluded by saying he feels 'honoured to still be here'.

"A Colorado nursing student was arrested yesterday after telling his therapist of his desire to shoot children, kill people on Halloween and assassinate President Obama, court records show. Mitchell Kenneth Kusick, 20, of Westminster, was being held on suspicion of a federal charge of threats against a president. He identified himself as a student at Colorado Mesa University in western Colorado, investigators said. Scroll down for video . Murderous intent? Mitchell Kenneth Kusick, a nursing student from Westminster, Colorado, was charged with making a threat against the president . Plot: Court papers say Kusick wanted to be known as 'the guy who killed President Obama,' pictured on Sunday at a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery . According to KUSA-TV in Denver, Jefferson County court records show he told his therapist about wanting to shoot children at a trick-or-treat event at Standley Lake High School. Federal court records say Kusick said he took a shotgun from his aunt's house and tried to buy ammunition. Is a doctor sworn to secrecy when a patient plans to commit a crime? It’s up to the doctor. Doctors can sever the physician-patient confidentiality if they become concerned, as the doctor of Mitchell Kusick did. The American Medical Association admits that its code of ethics are not bound by law. The issue was brought in another Colorado case, when Aurora theater gunman James Holmes's doctor went to police because she had become concerned about her patient. However, she did not give his name, citing doctor-patient confidentiality. The court will decide whether to allow a notebook believed to detail Holmes' plans, which he mailed to the psychiatrist, Dr Lynn Fenton, before the shooting. For members of the clergy, there is priest-penitent privilege in which a priest is bound by secrecy during church confessions, but there have been exceptions in court. The documents said that he claimed to . have owned a .22 caliber rifle and an assault rifle, but his parents . made him get rid of the weapons. He . told his therapist on October 29 about his plan and allegedly said he . wanted to go down in history as the 'guy who killed Obama.' His comments came just days before the president held a campaign rally in Boulder. Kusick . also said he was obsessed with the deadly shootings at Columbine High . School and Virginia Tech, as well as the Dark Knight Rises theater . massacre earlier this year, according to court records. Among Kusick’s interests on his Facebook . page are 'American conspiracies,' the Call of Duty video games and the film . Paul Blart: Mall Cop. The same document quoted Kusick of saying: 'Some people just want to watch the world burn down, and I’m one of them.' The therapist notified police, and Kusick was placed on a mental health hold at a hospital. A detention hearing is scheduled Friday. Violent interests: Kusick's therapist said he was obsessed with the Columbine and Virginia Tech shootings, and the Aurora theater massacre, in which James Holmes, pictured, was charged with killing 12 .

He claims inmates at the jail are being radicalised but the issue is not being addressed by prison bosses. 'Terror' preacher Abu Hamza and radical cleric Abu Qatada have both been held at the prison. The inmate wrote: 'The kitchen is usually occupied by 90 per cent Muslims and we have been told if we cook pork we will be stabbed. There have been incidents here where people have been targeted and pressured and bullied into converting to Islam. 'Young Muslim men are being radicalised in here and one day they may commit acts of terrorism in this country. 'There seems to be nothing being done here to stop it and people are scared to speak out.' The man also claimed Muslim inmates celebrated the murder of Drummer Lee Rigby at the Category A prison.

"If your canine displays attention-seeking behaviour (pictured), you may have a better bond with them than owners with well-mannered pooches . Badly behaved dogs can be a source of embarrassment for their owners. But if your canine companion displays attention-seeking behaviour, you may have a better bond with them than owners with perfectly-mannered pooches, a new study claims. The research looked at human-animal attachment among 60 dog-owning families, including parents and children. It is the first study to examine attachment in children in this way. Participants completed questionnaires to provide details about their attachment to their pet dogs, how responsible they feel towards them, and how often they feed and walk their canines. They were also asked to rate their dogs on behavioural characteristics such as excitability, trainability, stranger fear and aggression, separation problems and attention-seeking behaviour. Christy Hoffman, assistant professor of animal behaviour at Canisius College in Buffalo, New York, said that people who care for their dogs well and take more responsibility for them are more attached to their pets than those who have a more hands-off approach. While this is not surprising, her study also found that the more dogs act out and try to catch their owners’ attention, the more their owners are likely to love them. Interestingly, children were not affected by this behaviour. ‘Children’s attitudes and levels of attachment toward their pets remained high, even when dogs showed low levels of attention-seeking behaviour,’ Dr Hoffman said. Christy Hoffman, assistant professor of animal behaviour at Canisius College in Buffalo, New York, said that people who care for their dogs well and take more responsibility for them (stock image) are more attached to their pets than those who have a more hands-off approach . Adults tend to be more selective than . children in the types of dogs with which they bond ‘due to work-related . and parental responsibilities that already demand their attention. ‘Thus, adults may only form emotional attachments with dogs that seek out their attention,’ she explained. Dr Hoffman also discovered that owners have a better bond with their pets if their animal is well trained, but misses them when they are not around. If a dog likes socialising with humans, then the bond between canine and owner is greater still. The study did not identify any differences between men and women. and found that they are typically drawn to the same dog characteristics and are equally attached to their pets. Growing numbers of people are being kept awake at night by their pets, doctors have warned. The respected Mayo Clinic in the U.S. says that while many people sleep peacefully with their pet curled up beside them, some are left so exhausted that they seek specialist help. Snoring dogs, squawking parrots, wandering kittens, sick pets and animals with weak bladders are all disturbing vital shut-eye. Pampered pooches may be a problem, as well as more people owning more than one pet. Some 10 per cent of pet-owners who attended the clinic’s sleep centre in 2013 partly blamed their animals for their problems. The study’s author, Dr Lois Krahn, a psychiatrist, said: ‘The study determined that while the majority of patients did not view their pets intolerably disturbing their sleep, a higher percentage of patients experienced irritation. Dogs, cats and birds were the most popular pets and kept their owners awake by snoring, whimpering and wandering.","Research by Canisius College in New York found busy adults are more likely to bond emotionally with attention-seeking dogs .

"Katherine Russell, the widow of Boston bomb suspect, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, was 'an all-American girl who was brainwashed' by her extremist husband according to one schoolfriend. Today MailOnline has gained the first glimpse and pictures of the early life of the woman who, according to those who knew her best, was 'totally transformed' by Tsarnaev. At high school her personal motto was 'Do something about it or stop complaining'. She dreamed of going to college and joining the Peace Corps. She urged her friends to 'lighten up and enjoy the small things,' in life. Scroll down for video . Transformed: Katherine Russell, the American wife of marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev, is pictured left in her school book and, right, leaving the house she shared with her husband in Cambridge . Instead she met Tsarneav, 26, a disenfranchised man who came to America from his troubled homeland of Chechnya who rapidly had her in his thrall. By the time she was 21 she had married him and borne his child, Zahara, now three. She had converted to Islam, hidden her tumble of chestnut hair beneath the hijab and undergone a change so profound that today few friends profess to truly understand it. Yesterday Katherine, who has been staying at her parents’ home in Rhode Island, returned to the Cambridge, Massachusetts home which she shared with her late husband. Dressed in a leopard print hijab she darted into the white shingle house to collect some belongings and her pet cat while her daughter waited in the car. Today she was back home, accompanied by armed federal agents who first interviewed Katherine and her family on Friday. What did she know? Katherine's proximity to both brothers makes her a key witness - witting or otherwise. A team of federal agents today delivered a package to her home after her mother reluctantly answered the door . Great future: Her friends say she dreamed of going to the Peace Corps - before she met Tsarnaev . Shortly before 6pm on Sunday three law enforcement agents – two men, one woman - all wearing dark sunglasses delivered a package to the Russell's family home. Katherine's mother Judith was initially reluctant to answer the front door, opening it fully only after requesting that the officers, thought to be Federal Agents, showed their credentials. At around 7.30 the Federal agents returned to the Russell family home as there was a marked increase in law enforcement activity in this quiet suburban neighborhood. MailOnline has learned that the family's attorney entered by a back door as several officers were seen going into the family home. The agents stayed for just over an hour. Moments after they left, the family's attorney Amato DeLuca did likewise. Mr DeLuca said he could not discuss any detail of what had passed between his client and the agents, saying only that there were ‘talks.’ He said ‘We’re doing our best to deal with a very difficult situation. The family’s going through a lot. That’s the best I can do at the moment.’ Through the years: She had a comfortable upbringing as the eldest daughter of a doctor and a nurse . Involved: Russell, circled, is pictured with her high school dance team, third from right on the back row . Their presence raises the question how much did Katherine know about her late husband's activities and links? Katherine's . awareness of her then husband's movements, thoughts and plans is under . intense scrutiny as her relation to Tsaraev and her proximity to both . brothers makes her a key witness  - witting or otherwise. After . all she was living with Tsarnaev when he travelled to Makhachkala in . 2011 – a trip now attracting the interest of investigators trying to . establish whether he met with Gaczhimurad Dolgatov at that time. Dolgatov was a Dagestani jihadist who died in 2012 after a vicious . stand-off with Russian security services. As . it has already been revealed, Tsarnaev was on the FBI's radar during . that time as they were asked to look into his potential links to . extremist groups. None who knew her as a child could . have dreamed that this would be the face she would one day present to . the world, nor that her life and those of so many Bostonians would be so . violently caught up with two brothers from Chechnya and a cause as . unclear as it was brutal. Out: She exits a car with her father Warren Russell, left, as they arrive at the family home in Rhode Island . Changed: Her school friends have described how she transformed after meeting Tamerlan Tsarnaev . In hiding: The Russell family home in North Kingstown, Rhode Island, where Katherine is staying . Support: A man, believed to be Warren Russell, father of Katherine Russell, smiles at the media . Family: After pulling into her driveway, Judith Russell, Katherine's mother, spoke briefly with the media . As . a girl growing up in Rhode Island Katherine was known to her friends as . Katie. One school friend who asked not to be named recalled: ‘I saw her . like a few months ago and she was just totally transformed. She was not . the same person at all.’ Another . agreed: ‘She was just this All-American girl who was brainwashed by her . super-religious husband. Nobody understands what happened to her. ‘None of us would have dreamed that . she would marry so young or drop out of college and have a baby or . convert or be part of any of what’s happened.’ She said, ‘She’s just not the same person at all.’ It would be hard to imagine a . childhood more rooted in America’s pilgrim heritage than Katherine’s. It is in there in the names of the towns – Plymouth, Dorset, Greenwich – . where many of her friends still live and writ large in the wholesome . values of the one-time Honors student’s home life. The eldest of three daughters, to . emergency physician Dr Warren Russell and nurse Judith, hers is a . background steeped in the values of family and education. She . attended Daivisville Middle School, North Kingstown. As a sixth grader . she is pictured smiling from the pages of the 2001-2002 yearbook . dedicated to The North Kingstown Police and Fire Departments in the wake . of 9/11. – a date, the opening dedication reads, ‘forever in our . minds.’ A section of the book is titled, . ‘Enduring Freedom,’ as the school, along with the rest of the nation, . refused to be cowed by the acts of terror that hit the homeland that . day. 'Attackers': Her husband Tamerlan Tsarnaev and his younger brother Dzhokhar Tsarnaev were allegedly behind the bombings at the Boston Marathon last Monday, which left three dead and more than 180 injured . Patimat Suleimanova, aunt of the suspected bombers, shared this photo of a young Dzhokhar (C, bottom) and Tamerlan (C, top) with their sisters about 15 years ago . Chilling: Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev are seen near the marathon finish line before the bombings . Scene: Dzhokhar was found in a boat in Watertown, Massachusetts on Friday following a massive manhunt . In 2004 Katherine progressed to North Kingstown High School. She . took part gamely in the school’s Mismatch/Bad Hair Day; she dressed up . for Hawaiian day though the occasion fell in a chilly October. She . was a member of the Dance Team and the Art Club. In 11th grade she was . awarded a Silver Key for a rather odd image of a cat, lashing out at a . mouse in a ballet shoe. Her favorite food was Pad Thai. She . competed with her peers in Class Color Day that ended with a Pep Rally . in which seas of the school colors, green, blue, red, black and gold . filled the stands at the playing field. One classmate who remembers Katherine . from those early days said: ‘The thing that’s so shocking is that there . was nothing at all that made Katherine different. ‘Her parents are nice people, her sisters are great girls. But she met this guy, I guess, and everything changed.’ Memorial: Candles are lit for those who died in the Boston Marathon bombings and the subsequent police manhunt at a memorial on Boylston Street in Boston, Massachusetts April 21, 2013 . Remembering: A couple embraces at a memorial on Boylston Street to the victims of the Boston Marathon bombings in Boston . Flowers: A woman holds a flower at the memorial on Boylston Street last night . Katherine was a student at Suffolk University, Boston, when she met Tsaraev, then a promising boxer and athlete. It . was during that time that she converted and her youthful priorities . appear to have changed as she left in 2010 without graduating. By then her relationship with Tsaraev was intense. Not even his arrest for violently assaulting her in 2009 could change that. According to Cambridge City Police Department reports of the incident which took place in July at the Massachusetts home she once shared with Tsaraev, when interviewed she described Tsaraev as ‘a very nice man.’ Certainly he was a man whose influence on Katherine's life would prove profound. There is only one odd and unsettling inclusion in her own entry in her graduation High School Yearbook. Asked to provide a quotation she settled on one that would surely chime with the extremist views of her late husband. ‘Don’t take anything for granted,’ she advises, before quoting a line from David Bowie's 'Quicksand': ‘Don’t believe in yourself, don’t deceive with belief,’ the baffling lines run. ‘Knowledge comes from death’s release.’","Schoolfriend tells MailOnline how Katherine Russell had dreams of joining the Peace Corps - but was 'totally transformed' by Tamerlan Tsarnaev .

"Since she was a baby, Danielle Sheehan has suffered painful bouts of eczema. As a child the debilitating condition subsided. But four years ago  red patches returned on her arms and around her eyes. The model and dancer's self-esteem crumbled. She stopped booking photo shoots at work and refused to see her boyfriend during flare ups. The eczema around her eyes was aggravated by moisture, becoming particularly painful when she cried. She visited her doctor time and time again, trying tablets, creams, lotions and other remedies. But to no avail. The painful patches persisted, making Miss Sheehan's life a misery. A year ago the 24-year-old visited a cosmetic surgeon to have Botox, curious to see the cosmetic benefits. Scroll down for video . Danielle Sheehan, 24, from Suffolk has suffered painful bouts of eczema since she was a baby. After trying countless treatments including creams, ointments and light therapy she was shocked when Botox appeared to cure the skin condition . The model and dancer said she first had Botox, for purely cosmetic reasons, around 18 months ago. Her eczema was aggravated when she cried, with painful patches around her eyes. But five days after having the cosmetic procedure she noticed the patches had completely cleared up . Not only did the treatment leave her forehead and face without trace of any lines, the procedure appeared to clear up her eczema. Miss Sheehan, from Lowestoft in Suffolk, told MailOnline: 'I've always suffered from eczema, ever since I can remember. 'During my childhood it seemed to get a bit better but then, about four years ago it came back. 'I developed symmetrical patches in the creases of both arms, and then patches around my eyes as well. 'I obviously went to the doctors and tried literally everything - tablets, creams - everything. 'Nothing was working, even three months of light therapy treatment failed to make any difference. 'My self-esteem and confidence was really bad, it dragged me down. Eczema is a dry skin condition. Also known as dermatitis, it is highly individual, and varies from person to person. In mild cases the skin is dry, scaly, red and itchy. In more severe cases there may be weeping, crusting and bleeding. In the UK, one if five children and one in 12 adults have the condition. Keeping the skin moisturised using emollients (medical moisturisers) is key to managing all types of the conditon. Topical steroids are commonly used to bring flare ups under control. Source: National Eczema Society . 'I'm a model and a dancer and so my work really suffered. 'I stopped booking photo shoots, my eyes were so bad I didn't want to see my boyfriend and I used to have to put socks on my hands at night to stop me scratching. 'It had a huge impact on my life.' A year-and-a-half ago Miss Sheehan first had Botox. 'It wasn't something I was doing to actively help my eczema,' she explained. 'I was going along for purely cosmetic reasons.' Shortly after her treatment, Miss Sheehan discovered her then boyfriend had been cheating on her. 'I cried and cried, longer than ever before,' she said. But a day later, around five days after her Botox, Miss Sheehan said her mother was shocked at how fresh faced her daughter looked despite crying so much. 'By then the Botox had started to work,' she told MailOnline. 'It often takes five to seven days. 'My mum was really shocked, I was fresh faced. There was no sign of the red, angry patches of eczema that would flare up after I had been crying.' Miss Sheehan said told MailOnline her eczema was so bad she would cancel work and stop seeing her boyfriend, suffering low self-esteem . Almost overnight her confidence returned, as her eczema disappeared. 'I can't really describe it,' she said. 'It felt amazing. All of a sudden I felt good again. 'For the first time in years I liked how I looked, I liked what I saw in the mirror. 'It was so good. I told my surgeon and she said there is some research to suggest Botox is good for eczema.' Botox is used to help treat a number of different medical conditions. It has been found to help overactive bladder symptoms - the strong need to urinate with incontinence, prevent headaches in those suffering chronic migrane. She said almost overnight her confidence returned. 'For the first time in years, I liked how I looked,' she told MailOnline . It has also been found to help treat increased muscle stiffness in the elbow, wrist and finger muscles, as well as abnormal head positions and neck pain as a result of cervical dystonia. And research has found Botox can help treat eye muscle conditions, including the abnormal spasm of the eyelid in those aged over 12. In 2012, a study published by scientists at Edinburgh University, found Botox may be able to resolve itchy skin and eczema. A female patient who suffered itchy skin on her arms and torso for more than a decade experienced a dramatic reduction in her symptoms following Botox injections to the areas affected. The positive effects of the procedure were noted for a period of six months. Indeed, Miss Sheehan said she has had repeated bouts of the treatment since realising it has proved effective. She urged scientists to invest more time in researching Botox as a cure for the skin condition, in the hope it could be used as a treatment on the NHS in future. 'At £300 a go, it is pretty expensive,' she told MailOnline. 'But it works. I think it should be available free of charge to those people with really bad eczema. 'Obviously I like the cosmetic effects but my eczema is the reason I have Botox now. 'The results are really amazing. Literally everyone says how fresh faced I look now. 'My eczema used to really drag me down but now it's gone. For the first time in a really long time, I like the way I look.' It is thought Botox helps relieve the itchiness caused by eczema in the same way it treats wrinkles. The drug inhibits acetylcholine, a chemical that helps notify the muscles to contract.","Danielle Sheehan has suffered eczema since she was a baby .

"When Make-A-Wish Foundation approached Peter Srsich, a stage-four cancer patient, offering to make a dream of his come true, the 17-year-old boy had an unusual request: he wanted to meet the pope. Two years later, the Colorado teen is in remission - and he has credited his encounter with Benedict XVI with helping him beat the cancer. Srsich, a devout Catholic who is now studying for priesthood, is well aware that his cancer was cured thanks to decades of medical research and his doctors' extensive training - but he believes that meeting the former pontiff in Rome has restored his faith and gave him strength to fight for his life. Fateful meeting: In May 2012, Peter Srsich, 17, a stage-four cancer patient, got to meet with Pope Benedict XVI, who unexpectedly placed his hand on the exact spot where his tumor was to offer him a blessing . Humble offering: Unlike other people in line to meet the pontiff who came bearing costly presents, Peter handed the pope a simple wristband with the words 'Praying for Peter' that a friend had made for him . For Peter, the harrowing ordeal started in 2011 with a simple cough. When the lanky 6-foot-6 lacrosse player returned from a canoe trip in July of that year, he felt overwhelmed with the kind of fatigue that he had never experienced before, ABC News reported. The family suspected that the boy came down with pneumonia, but the reality was much more terrifying: doctors discovered a softball-sized mass in his left lung that was pressing on his heart. The tumor was diagnosed as a stage-four cancer. Luckily for Peter, he was young, strong and very athletic, giving him a good chance for survival. What followed was six months of grueling cancer treatment, which included seven rounds of chemotherapy that left the teenager completely bald. Srsich's diagnosis and treatment had another impact on the boy: it plunged him into depression and made him question why all this was happening to him. But the 17-year-old still found comfort in his faith. Knowing that he was devout, a friend created 1,200 lime-green wristbands with the words 'Praying for Peter' on them, along with Srsich's favorite Biblical passage, Romans 8:28. Out of the blue: For Peter, an athletic 17-year-old, it all started with a cough and a feeling of overwhelming fatigue, which turned out to be stage-four cancer . Harrowing ordeal: Srsich (far left) had to go through seven rounds of chemotherapy, which left him completely bald. His younger brother (center) and dad shaved their heads to support him . Three months into his treatment, Srsich was approached by the Make-a-Wish Foundation - a charity that grants wishes to children suffering from life-threatening illnesses. Peter's dream was an unusual one: the 17-year-old high school student wanted to go to Rome and see the pope in person. Trooper: The 17-year-old was treated with powerful drugs that plunged him into depression, but Peter fought on . 'I would have been perfectly fine if I just got a tour of the Vatican,' he later said . The Italian branch of Make-A-Wish helped organize the $14,000 trip, covering the cost of plane tickets, accommodations, meals and spending expenses. ‘After meeting Peter, there was no doubt in my mind it was his true wish and it was going to play an important role in what he wants to do career-wise,’ said his gift coordinator LuAnn Griffin. On a sunny day in May 2012, Peter, his parents and 15-year-old brother, Johnny, filed into St Peter’s Square in the Vatican to hear Pope Benedict XVI address the multinational audience in five languages. Afterwards, Peter and his family were invited to queue up before the pope along with a number of high dignities. Srsich was concerned: everyone else in line waiting to speak to the pontiff came bearing expensive gifts, but he only had a lime-green rubber wristband to offer the leader of the Catholic church. Finally, his turn was up to meet the pope. Towering over the diminutive pontiff, Peter told him that he had cancer and asked him for a blessing. And then something unexpected happened. ‘He looked at me and said, “Oh, you speak English?” and put his hand on my chest right where the tumor had been, even though I had not mentioned it to him,’ Peter recalled. ‘The blessing is usually on the head.’ Special moment: Even though Peter (second right) ended up missing most of his senior year of high school, he made it to his prom and was voted homecoming king . In February 2013, less than a year after the fateful encounter, Pope Benedict resigned due to his declining health and was replaced by Pope Francis I. These days,. Peter Srsich says he feels ‘wonderful.' He currently attends Regis University, a Jesuit college in Denver. His goal is to be ordained as a priest in about eight years. With his cancer on the ropes, the 19-year-old is also back to playing lacrosse and practicing taekwondo. Dream come true: When Peter (second left), pictured, with his mother, father and younger brother, was approach by the Make-A-Wish-Foundation, he asked to travel to Rome with his family and meet the pope . Although some Christian groups have latched on to Peter's recovery story, proclaiming it a miracle, Srsich does not see it quite that way. ‘Chemo helped me fight the cancer. Make-A-Wish helped me fight the chemo,’ he told ABC. ‘Knowing the pope was in my future helped me get through that, and in a small, non-miraculous way, helped cure my cancer.’","Peter Srsich was diagnosed with non-Hodgkins lymphoid in July 2011 after doctors found softball-sized mass on his lung .

"Former Kings Cross bouncer-turned-Islamic State recruiter Mohammad Baryalei is unlikely to be dead, according to a senior defence force chief. Baryalei, who left Australia in 2013 to go to Syria, is the highest-ranked Australian in the Islamic State jihadist group. Last month,reports emerged that he had died during air strikes in Syria, however Foreign Minister Julie Bishop was unable to confirm the death. A warrant was put out for his arrest in September as it emerged Baryalei was recruiting fighters to the Islamic State's cause in Syria. Scroll down for video . Mohammed Ali Baryalei was reported to have died in airstrikes on the Islamic State last month . Vice Admiral David Johnston says he has seen no information to confirm social media reports the Australian was killed . Defence force chief of joint operations Vice Admiral David Johnston says he has seen no information to confirm social media reports the Australian was killed in Syria last month. 'Increasingly, it looks less likely than likely,' he told reporters on Tuesday. 'I have not seen anything to indicate, on balance, that he is dead.' His phone calls to Australia, allegedly regarding a plot to behead a random member of the public, sparked the largest anti-terrorism raids in the country's history, which targeted 25 homes in NSW and Queensland. A social media report at the end of October said Baryalei had been martyred, although it gave no details, and the Australian government was unable to confirm the reports. Vice Admiral Johnston says he has seen reports indicating a number of IS leaders have been targeted in air strikes, and there is no doubt that is having an impact on their leadership capability. His phone calls to Australia, allegedly regarding a plot to behead a random member of the public, sparked the largest anti-terrorism raids in Australian history . The Baryalei family arrived in Australia more than 30 years ago as refugees from Afghanistan. Unbeknownst to his family, Baryalei chose to join terror group Jabhat al-Nusra then the Islamic State. During the September terror raids, Mohammed Baryalei was named by police as the instigator behind a plot to behead a member of the public in an Australian city which was to be filmed with the victim draped in the Islamic State's black flag. He worked with the Street Dawah movement, a group of Muslims who recruited on the streets of western Sydney. Mr Baryalei, who left Australia in 2013 to go to Syria, is the highest-ranked Australian in the Islamic State jihadist group . In a briefing to reporters on Australian operations in Iraq, Mr Johnston said Australian Super Hornet aircraft had conducted raids on IS facilities, hitting vehicles, compounds and fighting positions. As well, Australian C-130J Hercules transport aircraft had conducted a further four humanitarian air drops of food, water, tents and blankets to civilians on Mount Sinjar in northern Iraq during the past week. The Australian aircraft were part of a multinational coalition conducting the air drops before the harsh Iraqi winter. That follows two air drops to the same area in August, Australia's first missions of the Iraq campaign.

"Britons cannot do without their iPads and iPhones after naming Apple as their favourite American export. A study has found that one in three British people think the electronic giants and their products are the best thing to come from America. They ranked the devices above the invention of the light bulb, credit card, hamburger and even Elvis. The research, conducted by St Pancras International Station to celebrate Thanksgiving, saw 36 per cent of people place Apple at the top of the table. Britons named Apple, who make the iPhone, as the number one thing they are most grateful to American for. It beat the light bulb into second place . Apple was founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne on April 1, 1976, to develop and sell personal computers like the iPad pictured above . It was followed by the light bulb with 25 per cent, credit card 22 per cent, and wheeled luggage 22 per cent. The TV comedy, Friends, starring Jennifer Aniston, Matt LeBlanc, Lisa Kurdrow, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer, came in fifth. Also featuring highly were Americano coffee, scented candles, milkshakes and Elvis. Across the Atlantic Americans named the 1960s rock and roll band, The Beatles, as their favourite British export. In a survey 39 per cent of Americans named the UK's best export as The Beatles . The fab four beat the television, which was created by John Logie Baird . The Fab Four received 39 per cent of the vote followed by the television 34 per cent, the internet 31 per cent and Ian Fleming's fictional character, James Bond, with 30 per cent. Afternoon tea, the toilet, picnics and whisky also made the American list of UK favourites. Wendy Spinks, Commercial Director of HS1 International Ltd (owners of St Pancras International) said: 'We twinned with Grand Central Terminal earlier this year as we have lots in common; we both have stunning architecture, eye-catching clocks and reputations as romantic meeting destinations. 'In the spirit of our American friends and Thanksgiving, we wanted to reflect on what we are most thankful to the U.S. for as a nation. 'Every day we see lots of people whizzing through the station with wheeled luggage, on their iPads or sipping Americanos on the concourse, and it's great to be able to say thanks to the U.S. for their contribution.'

"A civilian who dressed as a Royal Marine  on Remembrance Sunday told police he was just trying to pay his respects to a friend killed in Afghanistan. Carwyn Pollard wore a green beret, camouflage,  the Royal Marines dagger insignia and a lance corporal's stripe on November 9 in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk. But the 18-year-old was arrested after a serving soldier spotted he had no army-issue boots, an emblem was displayed wrongly on his arm and he was too young to be a lance corporal. Suspicions: Great Yarmouth magistrates heard questions were raised about Pollard when he joined veterans at a parade and service to remember Britain's war dead in his home town a few weeks ago . Pollard - whose actions the  soldier described as a 'disgrace' - admitted the offence of wearing a uniform and medal without permission of the Queen, which carries a  fine of up to £1,000 under the 1894 Uniforms Act. He was also wearing an International Security Assistance Force service medal for Afghanistan, which was not one  the Ministry of Defence had  authorised for use with a uniform. But he told a court the medal belonged to a friend who had died on active service, and he was just trying to pay tribute. Great Yarmouth magistrates heard suspicions were raised about Pollard when he joined veterans at a parade and service to remember Britain's war dead in his home town. Criminal record: Carwyn Pollard, 18, was arrested and charged after he dressed as a Royal Marine at a Remembrance Sunday parade in Norfolk. He told police he was just trying to honour a friend killed in service . Prosecutor Denis King said serving soldier Luke Watson, 23, who was also at the parade, spotted 'various discrepancies' in Pollard's uniform. Police then arrested him on the seafront, where a second ceremony in memory of Far East prisoners of war was being held after the town's main Remembrance Sunday service. In interview the unemployed teenager said he had been wearing an old uniform from when he was in the 901 Troop Marine Cadets, based in nearby Winterton. Mr King added: 'He accepts he had dressed to look like a soldier. The Crown's case is not that this defendant intended to cause offence. No bragging: Prosecutors accepted he was not trying to pass himself off as a Royal Marine . 'The Crown is happy to accept his explanation that he was there to convey his respects, although he did it in an inappropriate way.' Claire Edgeler, defending, said Pollard had become a cadet in Cambridgeshire before joining the unit in Norfolk. 'He concedes he is no longer in the Cadets,' she said. 'The person who introduced him to the cadets was a serving soldier and that young man died in Afghanistan. 'Mr Pollard was extremely grateful to this young man and wanted to show his respects. He thought the best way was to wear his old cadet's uniform. He accepts he should not have put on the Commando badge. 'The Lance Corporal stripe was from his time in the cadets. He was certainly not attending the Remembrance Day service with the aim of upsetting anybody. 'It was misguided and had he stopped to think, he may have realised that other people may have been offended by his actions. 'There is no suggestion he was trying to impersonate someone from the armed forces. He simply wore a uniform without permission. 'The medal he was wearing was one his friend had been awarded. The friend gave it to him before his last tour and asked him to look after it and said he would retrieve it on his return. 'In hindsight he should have worn it on his right side, not his left, as medals can be worn on the right in memory of someone. In his ignorance he was unaware that those awarded it, should not be wearing it.' Mrs Edgeler added Pollard had been subject to 'unpleasant threats' since his arrest was made public and now felt a prisoner in his own home. Presiding magistrate Carol Doe said she accepted that Pollard did not intend to upset anybody, but 'not surprisingly', his actions had caused offence. She handed Pollard a 12-month conditional discharge and ordered him to pay £100 in costs and a victim surcharge. She also ordered the destruction of his uniform, apart from the medal. Speaking after the case, Pollard declined to identify the friend who he said had been awarded the medal. Magistrates handed Pollard a 12-month conditional discharge and ordered him to pay £100 in costs and a victim surcharge. They also ordered the destruction of his uniform, apart from the medal . Keith Savage, a member of staff at the independent 901 Troop Marine Cadets, said after the hearing that Pollard had only been in the unit for six to eight weeks last year before being discharged for alleged dishonesty. He denied Pollard's claim to police that he had been awarded the green beret for completing a course with the unit, and said he appeared to have added insignia to his uniform . Mr Savage said: 'We do not use the Commando insignia and we certainly never issue a green beret. They are a sacred thing and are only ever issued to people who go through hell on the Commando training course.' Paul Williams, 74, the chairman of Great Yarmouth branch of the Royal British Legion and standard bearer at the parade, declined to comment on the furore. 'The incident happened out of my sight and did not disturb the overall dignity of the occasion,' he said.","Carwyn Pollard, 18, wore Afghan medal and Marine kit in Great Yarmouth .

"A fraudster who pretended to be in a coma for two years was caught by police going on shopping trips and holidays with his family. Conman Alan Knight of Swansea, South Wales, faked being in a vegetative state after he scammed his next door neighbour out of £40,000. The 47-year-old tried to beat justice by claiming he was a quadriplegic - his family said he was hooked up to oxygen and had no movement from the neck down. Scroll down for video . Conman Alan Knight (pictured) of Swansea, South Wales faked that he was in a vegetative state after he scammed his next door neighbour out of £40,000 . But a court heard how he was caught out after CCTV captured him walking around the Tesco supermarket (pictured) in Bishops Cleeve . But a court heard he was caught out after CCTV captured him walking around Tesco and driving his car to Dorset. Knight was then hauled before Swansea Crown Court where he admitted scamming the pensioner who lived next door to him out of thousands of pounds. The fraudster had been living off benefits after claiming he had suffered a massive neck injury. The court heard that he claimed his injury had caused him to have seizures which left him in a comatose state. His wife Helen, 33, claimed she had to care for her husband who had snapped his neck after falling backwards as he pulled down a garage door. But the whole time he was carrying out an elaborate three-year fraud targeting neighbour Ivor Richards' life savings and shares, the court heard. Alan Knight was pushed into Swansea Crown Court in a wheelchair by his wife Helen . The 47-year-old, pictured with wife Helen, tried to beat justice claiming he was a quadriplegic, was even hooked up to oxygen and that he had no movement from the neck down . The court was told how he 'systematically' funnelled £41,570 out of the pensioner's bank account which he used to pay for holidays and to buy a caravan in Dorset. The father-of-three was caught on CCTV at the Severn bridge toll on the M4 as he travelled back from the south coast. He was also captured on CCTV in Tesco stores across the country after police traced the use of the family's loyalty club card. Officers tried 'at least twice' to bring him to court but each time he admitted himself to hospital claiming his condition had worsened. Swansea Crown Court was told he had 'pulled the wool' over his GP's eyes but he was unable to fool doctors at the hospital. While he was on 'observations' they spotted him eating, wiping his face and even writing. Knight was told he would have to stand trial even if he did not attend, and he finally appeared in court in a wheel chair and wearing a neck brace.

'Aspects of this case in my experience are unique, and a strong message needs to be sent out to anyone who seeks to adopt similar tactics. 'Having seen the CCTV evidence from Tesco and driving the car, I have come to the conclusion he is putting it on. 'Attempts to make progress have been thwarted by Mr Knight pretending to be ill. 'Although a very accomplished and determined actor, he is nothing like in the condition he claims to be, and the conditions he claims to be suffering from are simply non existent. 'His illnesses coincide with impending court appearances. I do not believe the symptoms are genuine. 'He has been monitored, despite attempts to maintain the fiction.

Previously, he had escaped standing trial twice, in September 2012 and July 2013. A third trial was due to start today with a judge at Swansea Crown Court signalling it would go ahead in his absence. The decision came after a day of discussions at the court yesterday during which expert evidence demonstrated conclusively that Knight was a fraudster. Today Knight avoided a trial as he admitted 19 separate charges of forgery, fraud and theft over more than a year from November 2008. He will be sentenced next month. Detective Constable Harry Paul, who led the case, said: 'In my entire career this is the most calculated, long-term deception of a vulnerable, elderly neighbour I have ever seen. 'He had constantly avoided court for two years, costing police, the NHS and the court system thousands of pounds'.","Alan Knight scammed neighbour out of £40,000 but refused to go to court .

"It was an excoriating public dressing-down, an email fired off by a retired naval commander to the three children he regards as a ‘bitter disappointment’. But yesterday former nuclear submarine captain Nick Crews, 67, got an unequivocal broadside back. After the publication of his father’s heartfelt tirade – a no-punches-pulled  salvo accusing his public school-educated children of failing in their careers and marriages – Mr Crews’s son Fred, 35, replied: ‘Sorry, but you made me.’ 'Cock-up' children: Fred Crews and his sister Emily were the recipients of an email from their father in which he spoke of the 'bitter disappointment' he felt at his children's inability to pursue fulfilling careers . Speaking as he prepared for his shift at . a taxi office, Fred, bare-chested and sporting a stomach tattoo, said . his father could no longer treat him ‘like a sailor in his command’. And he added his father had done ‘enough of that in my formative years to ensure that I do not have the confidence to succeed in life now’. He accused Mr Crews of acting like his own father before him, and insisted he would not speak to him again without an apology. The family feud burst into the public domain when Nick Crews published the email at the request of daughter Emily Crews-Montes, 40 – one of his targets – who now lives in France and works as a translator for a publisher. She is the only one of the siblings still speaking to her parents. Dear All Three . With . last evening’s crop of whinges and tidings of more rotten news for . which you seem to treat your mother like a cess-pit, I feel it is time . to come off my perch. We . are seeing the miserable death throes of the fourth of your collective . marriages at the same time we see the advent of a fifth... Having . done our best to provide for our children, we naturally hoped to see . them provide happy and stable homes for their own children. Fulfilling . careers based on your educations would have helped – but as yet none of . you is what I would term properly self-supporting. So . we witness the introduction to this life of six beautiful children none . of whose parents have had the maturity to make a reasonable fist at . making essential threshold decisions. The . predictable result has been a decade of deep unhappiness over the fates . of our grandchildren. If it wasn’t for them, Mum and I would not be too . concerned, as each of you crashes from one cock-up to the next. It . makes us weak that so many of these events are copulation-driven and . then to see these lovely little people being so woefully let down by . you. I can now tell you . that I for one have had enough of being forced to live through the . never-ending bad dream of our children’s domestic ineptitudes. I want to hear no more from any of you until you have a success or an achievement to tell me about. If . you think I have been unfair in what I have said, by all means try  to . persuade me to change my mind. But you won’t do it by simply whingeing. If that isn’t possible then I rest my case. I am bitterly, bitterly disappointed. Dad . In his email, addressed to ‘Dear All Three’, Mr Crews spoke of the ‘bitter disappointment’ he felt at the ‘miserable death throes of the fourth of your collective marriages’, his children’s inability to pursue fulfilling careers based on public school educations, and the fact none of them was ‘properly self-supporting’. He said his six ‘beautiful’ grandchildren had parents who lacked maturity and sound judgment ‘as each of you consciously, and with eyes wide open, crashes from one cock-up to the next’. Witheringly, he added that for he and his wife Sarah, ‘it makes us weak that so many of these events are copulation-driven, and then helplessly to see these lovely little people being so woefully let down by you, their parents’. Yesterday Nick Crews told The Mail on Sunday he had ‘nothing to apologise for’ and that many friends facing similar challenges had emailed him messages of support. Earlier, Fred, clearly furious that the row had gone public – through an article in yesterday’s Daily Mail – said: ‘I’m not going to dignify him with a full response. ‘He knows what the score is. I’ve spoken to my Mum and I responded to his email. I likened him to his own father and left it at that. He said what he wanted to say but there are other things he shouldn’t have said. ‘He said he didn’t want any of us to contact him again until we had some good news. Well, if he wants us to talk to him now, then he shouldn’t have written that. That’s what needs to be apologised for.’ Speaking from the Plymouth terraced house where he is living with his sister, Fred insisted his father had only himself to blame. ‘He compared us to his friends’ children and said what an embarrassment we were and how he can’t boast about us,’ he said. ‘Well, I’m sorry, but you made me. That also needs to be apologised for.’ But perhaps something of his father’s sense of duty has rubbed off on Fred after all, as he insisted he was unable to stay and provide a full interview as he could not let his employer down. ‘My father made me who I am today and I think he did a good job,’ he said. ‘I do not leech off him, my mother or society – except for a brief stint on Job Seekers’ Allowance – nor am I a criminal of any sort. I try to keep to the values I have been brought up with.’ Nearby, at the family’s detached, six-bedroomed house in a Plymouth suburb, an unrepentant Nick Crews made a robust defence of the decision to set out his frustrations in the email, sent earlier this year. And his wife Sarah made clear she backed every word. ‘Absolutely, it needed saying,’ she insisted. ‘An email was the right way to go because they absolutely took notice of something there in black and white.’ Mr Crews said: ‘What I was saying to my children was that if they got their ducks in a row, their children would be getting a better start. As a father and a grandfather, don’t you have a duty to do that? I think you do. I don’t like living with the repercussions of this and it makes you very sad that your children hate you. But life is hard. Happier times: Nick Crews poses with his daugher Emily on her wedding day. He laments his children's inability to pursue fulfilling careers . Daddy's girl: Emily Crews-Montes now lives in France. She is the only one of the siblings still talking to her parents . Unapologetic: Nick Crews (pictured yesterday) thinks his email was necessary . ‘There are people in society who . desperately need financial support and for that support to be sucked up . by people, my children, who could do better is not acceptable to me. ‘My . message to other parents who feel as I do is that you have a social . responsibility to say your piece. I can remember my father saying things . to me that I didn’t like to hear. Friends have emailed me to say, “I’ve . had to write a letter like that and it’s not nice.” They have been very . supportive. ‘If you had one child like this you’d think, “Do I say anything?” But I’ve had three out of three and you wonder whether you’re an appalling father with defective genes. It’s not just one of them that’s had a failed marriage – it’s three out of three. ‘Emily said to me, “We’re not  triplets, we’re all individuals.” But  they all needed the same message for their own individual reasons.  I thought that by sending it to all three none of them would be singled out as a black sheep. ‘One of the gratifying things about it is that they closed ranks and they came together and decided how they were going to cope with it. I think that’s fantastic. Certainly Emily has had this appalling email chucked at her and said, “Right, it’s time to pull my socks up”.’ Historic: Like his father, Fred went to Sherborne School in Dorset, where fees are £10,100 a term . Mr Crews, who spends his spare time restoring paintings and sailing yachts, said the children were sent to public schools because he felt it gave them the best possible start. Like his father, Fred went to Sherborne School in Dorset, where fees are £10,100 a term. Emily, an Exeter University psychology graduate, attended Stoodley Knowle boarding school in Torquay. Reflecting on the situation, Mr Crews felt moved to finally observe: ‘It’s not a bad thing to write and say, “Hey, look, you’re leaving a trail as you bash through life and your mum and dad are part of the wreckage.” ’","Nick Crews sent an email to his three children speaking of 'disappointment'

"Circus staff have been warned by police after taking a  2.5 tonne rhinoceros for a walk in Germany without any restraints. Panicked locals in the town of Luckenwalde called authorities after spotting the rhino, nicknamed Hulk, walking along the road without any lead or restraints. But by the time police got to the scene the animal was back at the Circus Voyage site along with its keeper. Police stood down, but hours later they received another call claiming a rhino had escaped. This time they caught the animal's keeper and circus director walking the rhino to the local park. Police spokesman Marcus Braun said: 'The circus staff were given a stiff talking to by the officers, and warned that it was not allowed to take rhinos onto the streets.' The circus said they did not understand the fuss over the 34-year-old rhino being allowed to get some fresh air, and added that Hulk was completely tame and unlikely to harm anyone. The animal's keepers rejected the idea of putting the rhino on a lead when they walked him. The same rhinoceros sparked a similar alert three years ago after he escaped from the circus while it was performing in the town of Goslar in Lower Saxony.","Panicked locals in Luckenwalde called police saying the rhino had escaped .

"An Oregon man has been sentenced to life in prison for the murder of his wife, local media reported. Joshua Cavett, 37, was sentenced Monday - though there is the possibility of parole following 28 years behind bars, The Oregonian reported. Cavett entered into a plea bargain - and entered guilty pleas for murder, felon in possession of a firearm as well as felon in possession of body armor, the news outlet reported.

Two months before her death, Jessie Cavett was looking to divorce from her husband and also filed a restraining order, the newspaper reported. Defense attorney Gordon Mallon said in court that the shooting happened following the rejection of his client's visitation request to see his daughter, according to The Oregonian. Mallon also reportedly cited drug use and paranoia - the latter of which he claimed was a byproduct of a brain injury from a beating meant to induct him into a motorcycle club - as other factors in the slaying. MailOnline earlier reported that Cavett belonged to The Gypsy Jokers, which do not allow African-Americans into the club. According to KATU, Cavett admitted to the murder of his wife Jessie Cavett last October, which took place right in front of two girls.

"With a single, vicious and unprovoked punch, a life is tragically ended. Andrew Young, 40, paid an appalling price for his good citizen act of challenging a cyclist who was  riding on the pavement. The cyclist’s friend, a convicted robber, delivered the killer blow – yet could spend just two years behind bars. Mr Young’s mother yesterday described the sentence as an ‘absolute joke’. Scroll down for video . This is the shocking moment Andrew Young was punched by Lewis Gill - Mr Young died of head injuries a day later in hospital . Mr Young was attacked by Gill after the 40-year-old became involved in an argument with his friend . Gill, 20, can be seen to walk away after looking back to see his victim lying motionless on the ground . The shocking incident took place on a . busy street in Bournemouth when Mr Young warned Victor Ibitoye that . riding on the pavement was dangerous. When the conversation ended Lewis Gill, who was with Mr Ibitoye, punched Mr Young, taking him by surprise. Distressing CCTV footage shows the Asperger’s sufferer toppling back on to the road, violently striking his head. Gill, . who has a conviction for handling stolen goods as well as robbery, then . walks away, with a glance back at his motionless victim. Passers-by came to Mr Young’s aid but he died the following day in hospital. His mother Pamela was at his bedside. Mr Young (left), who suffered from Asperger's Syndrome, was said to be able to speak several languages but had the social skills of a 14-year-old due to his condition. Gill (right) pleaded guilty to a charge of manslaughter and was jailed for four-and-a-half years . Mr Young became involved in an argument with cyclist Victor Ibitoye after he told him that cycling on the pavement was dangerous . After the hearing Mrs Young said her son (pictured) did not cause Gill 'any harm' Yesterday Gill, 20, pleaded guilty to a charge of manslaughter for which he was jailed for just four years. He . was sentenced by Judge Keith Cutler, who was criticised for his . handling of the inquest into the gangster Mark Duggan, whose shooting by . police sparked the riots of 2011.Mrs Young said: ‘You can see Andrew didn’t cause Lewis Gill any harm. ‘I . wish that awful man who took my son away had pleaded not guilty so he . would have got a longer sentence. The sentence is an absolute joke. ‘I’m a committed Christian but I think that if someone takes a life they should be prepared to forfeit their own.’ She said that too few killers served full sentences. Tory . MP David Davies said of Gill’s punishment: ‘That’s an outrageously lean . sentence. In two years he will be out walking the streets after taking . somebody’s life. ‘He has . attacked someone unprovoked and should be properly punished. People . need to realise if you punch someone like that, and they fall backward, . they can die.’ Explaining . why Gill would receive just four years, Judge  Cutler told him: ‘What I . have had to look at is what was in your mind at the time you threw that . punch. ‘You wanted to . cause some injury to Mr Young. If you wanted to cause grievous bodily . harm it would have been a murder charge. You are very, very lucky that . was not in fact the outcome.’ The judge told the hearing at Salisbury Crown Court on Friday that the case lay somewhere between murder and manslaughter. ‘I bear in mind your early guilty plea. I accept there is no pre-meditated element and provocation does exist,’ he told Gill. After the hearing, Mr Young's mother Pamela described the sentence as a 'joke' The . maximum sentence for manslaughter is life, but the term can be shorter, . at the discretion of the judge. With half his sentence served on . licence, and allowing for time already served, Gill could be out of jail . in under two years. The . judge told Gill, from Sutton, Surrey, that Mr Young was no threat: ‘You . are a powerfully built young man. You must have known that [the punch] . was going to cause a significant injury and, very sadly, it did.’ Gill was also sentenced to two three-month terms to run consecutively with the manslaughter sentence. This . was for committing the crime while on a suspended sentence for the . robbery and handling offences. In mitigation, Steven Perian said: ‘He . wishes he could turn back the clock and not react in the way he did.’ Mr . Young, a former grammar school pupil, regular church-goer and speaker . of several languages, was said to have the social skills of a . 14-year-old due to his Asperger’s. Taxi . driver Simon Scott said of him: ‘Andrew was always friendly and polite . and often struck up conversations with strangers. He was gentle and . wouldn’t hurt a fly.’ His . mother added: ‘He was very particular because of his Asperger’s and he . wouldn’t have liked seeing someone riding a bicycle on the pavement.’ The incident took place outside a Tesco Express in the Charminster area of Bournemouth at 4.25pm on November 6. Keith Cutler made a controversial decision to hold a 20-second silence for Mark Duggan . The judge who sentenced Lewis Gill was at the centre of the Mark Duggan inquest that ended in January. At the start of the hearing, Keith Cutler made the controversial decision to hold a 20-second silence to acknowledge the ‘regrettable loss of a young life’. The death of Duggan, a gangster who was shot twice by police marksmen, sparked the London riots that broke out in summer 2011. The senior circuit judge led the silence – virtually unprecedented at an inquest – by lowering his head and clasping his hands together. He later explained: ‘It was my idea. I know it was controversial, and I know the police were bristling about it and sections of the media were very critical, but I believe that Mark Duggan’s death led to a great deal of unrest. ‘I thought that a few moments’ reflection at the start of the inquest might be quite healing.’ He also said he would ask the dead man’s family to help shape recommendations on police firearms procedure. Jurors were given special protection by police as they left the Royal Courts of Justice, following the intimidation and abuse they faced from Duggan’s supporters during the hearing. There were claims the judge had treated the Duggan family with ‘kid gloves’ during the inquest which ended last month. Judge Cutler once admitted that he enjoys having the power to show leniency. And he has reacted angrily to criticism from Government ministers who accused judges of ‘soft’ sentencing. The response came in 2006 in his role as secretary of the Council of Circuit Judges. The married father-of-two is a Christian who was installed as a lay canon of Salisbury Cathedral in 2009. The Duggan inquest ended with an 8-2 majority jury verdict that his death was a lawful killing.","Andrew Young, 40, died in hospital after he was punched by Lewis Gill .

"Madeleine McCann's family say they 'would welcome' a fresh search of a man-made lake close to the holiday resort where the three-year-old was taken, amid claims her body may have been dumped there. A rain-sodden letter reportedly discovered outside the room from which she vanished on the first anniversary of her disappearance contained details of what it claimed was her final resting place. A handyman who discovered the note is said to have immediately handed it to the Portuguese police, but it is understood that a full underwater search of the Barragem da Bravura reservoir - which lies nine miles from the Ocean Club resort in Praia da Luz - has never been carried out. Despite the claims made in the letter, there remains no evidence to suggest Madeleine is dead, and her parents Gerry and Kate McCann still cling to the hope that she will one day be found alive. Scroll down for video . Hope: Madeleine McCann's parents Kate (left) and Gerry (right) have called for a fresh search of a man-made lake close to the holiday resort where the three-year-old was taken . Disappearance: Madeleine McCann (pictured left and right) went missing in 2007, aged three. The case has become one of the most high profile missing children cases in Britain's history . The letter containing allegations relating to Madeleine's disappearance was discovered by a handyman on the rain-soaked doorstep of the Ocean Club's room 5A - the room from which Madeleine went missing - according to the Mirror. It was found on the the night of May 3, 2008 - a year to the day of Madeleine's disappearance. The letter is understood to have been headed 'Madeleine Beth McCann' but otherwise written in Portuguese. It reportedly started with a description of her being dumped in the Barragem da Bravura reservoir which it described as her 'final resting place'. 'I spoke to the other staff about it and they said to hand it in to the Portuguese police. I gave it to them, but I have no idea what they did about it,' the handyman told the newspaper. He went on to describe Barragem da Bravura as 'the perfect place to hide a body'. Chilling: The letter reportedly started with a description of Madeleine being dumped in the Barragem da Bravura reservoir which it described as her 'final resting place' Search: A spokesperson for Kate and Gerry McCann said they would 'welcome' any new searches of the Barragem da Bravura and the surrounding woodland . The woodland area surrounding the reservoir is understood to have been searched several months before the emergence of the letter but no underwater investigation was carried out. Following the discovery of the note, a two-hour second search was carried out using sniffer dogs, but eyewitnesses reportedly claim that police divers were still not deployed. A spokesperson for Kate and Gerry McCann said they would 'welcome' any new searches of the Barragem da Bravura and the surrounding woodland. Clarence Mitchell said: 'Kate and Gerry will be informed of what this witness is telling the Daily Mirror. 'We would welcome any new searches. But they cannot comment on any specific detail as that is entirely a matter for Operation Grange and the Portuguese authorities.' Investigation: Robert Murat pictured in Praia da Luz, in August 2007. Mr Murat has said he would have no problem speaking to police again if they wished . Last week a Portuguese newspaper claimed that police investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann want to question British ex-pat Robert Murat. Scotland Yard detectives want to speak to several potential witnesses including Mr Murat, who was previously questioned by Portuguese police after Madeleine vanished in 2007 just before her fourth birthday, the newspaper Jornal de Noticias reported. Mr Murat, 41, who has always denied any involvement in Madeleine's disappearance, said neither he nor his lawyer had been contacted by police, but said he would co-operate if contacted. Mr Murat was named as an arguido – a person of interest or suspect - during the Portuguese investigation seven years ago, as were Madeleine's parents Kate and Gerry McCann. All three were later cleared when the Portuguese investigation ended in 2008. Scotland Yard launched its own investigation and its inquiry team travelled to Praia da Luz to conduct searches and observe Portuguese police interviews.","Rain-sodden letter found on first anniversary of Madeleine's disappearance .

"A baby girl who was born with her small heart beating outside of her body is now remarkably recovering after a revolutionary surgery saved her life. Audrina Cardenas was born with a rare congenital disease where her heart formed outside the chest; though the disease affects only one in eight million, 90 percent of infants with the condition are stillborn or die within days of their birth. But after hours of complicated surgery at the Texas Children’s Hospital in Houston, Audrina is recovering, and her mother Ashley couldn’t be more thankful.

Incredible video taken during the surgery shows it beating at a steady pace. Her mother found out about her daughter’s life-threatening condition at a routine check-up at 16 weeks. Ms Cardenas said she was given three options, each of them difficult in their own right –abort the baby, carry her to term knowing she would die shortly thereafter, or have doctors construct a hole in her unborn baby’s chest to make room for the heart. She told the Houston Chronicle that her choice to have her newborn daughter operated on was incredibly difficult. ‘You’ll never know what it feels like to make that decision until you’re faced with it,’ she said.

They must wait for Audrina to heal and gain strength before attempting any additional procedures. She will need to see a cardiologist for the rest of her life, but doctors said the prognosis is good. Dr Carolyn Altman, a pediatric cardiologist at the hospital, said in a release: 'Despite Audrina's misplaced heart, she was born with no other syndromes or genetic conditions that would cause additional stress or complications on her heart.

'The reason I talk about my background in policing is to say that I know what I'm doing in relation to these arrests - I understand the law.' The Sydney Morning Herald filmed Mr Howarth conducting one of his arrests during a ride-along with a hidden camera. In the video, he books an UberX in the Sydney CBD and strikes up a conversation with the driver, who appears to be unaware that operating an UberX is against the law. After they get out of the car Mr Howarth informs the driver he is placing the man under citizen's arrest. Mr Howarth (pictured in red circle) said his policing background, including two years in the advanced riot squad and counter-terrorism, would help him in his quest to 'stop' Uber . Police attended the scene but the driver later told the Herald he didn't receive any warning or fine from police and was reassured by Uber than he was not doing anything illegal. A NSW police spokeswoman said the matter was subject to a police investigation and 'it is not appropriate to comment further'. Mr Howarth said until earlier this month he had been an Uber Partner for two years, helping to sign drivers and passengers to the app. 'I brought probably like a third of the cars they had on in their first year,' he said. 'In terms of clients easily over 500-1000 passengers.' But he said he changed his tune because he disagreed with the way Uber operated. 'I realised I couldn't be part of the lie,' he said. 'I would have been rewarded handsomely for it if I convinced more drivers to come on their illegal platform. 'I just thought if I'm not going to be with them I'm actually going to try to stop them.' Mr Howarth argues that UberX drivers are often unaware that what they are doing is breaking the law under the NSW Passenger Transport Act . Mr Howarth said he has been labelled a 'thug' but asserts he has never used excessive force during his arrests. 'I am clearly not fighting individual drivers – I'm clearly fighting Uber. 'Uber is coercing, manipulating and exploiting these people - not Russell Howarth. 'And if Russell Howarth wasn't out there arresting them every now and then they would still be out there committing these offences.' A spokeswoman for Uber said Mr Howarth had been 'harassing' a number of drivers and the company had reported him to authorities. 'Russell claims to represent a taxi industry that has not faced any competition in decades and, through its association with Mr Howarth, is now resorting to open intimidation and threats of force to those who dare to provide an alternative service,' she said. 'Hundreds of thousands of riders have taken millions of trips in Australia and we are growing exponentially week on week. The spokeswoman said Uber has signed up 1100 new drivers  last month, adding that not one of the drivers Mr Howarth has 'harassed' has left Uber. A spokeswoman for Uber said Russell had been 'harassing' a number of partners and the company had reported him to authorities . 'With the taxi industry now threatening violence against Uber partners, we call on governments to remove the ambiguity around ridesharing, begin its promised consultation process and provide certainty to the the thousands of Uber partners who are working to provide for themselves and their families,' she said. The NSW Taxi Council denies any affiliation with Mr Howarth, but is critical of the app and other ride-sharing services. 'The issue here, setting aside his actions, is there is a prevailing sense of injustice among our industry,' said NSW Taxi Council CEO Roy Wakelin-King. 'From the fact that [registered taxi drivers] do right thing, they comply with the law, they have to pay all of their obligations, have cameras in their cars, pay for proper insurance, yet they see people thumbing their nose at the law and operating illegally.' NSW Transport Minister said Gladys Berejiklian there were serious safety issues to consider. 'This is a complex issue and cities all around the world are grappling with it as we speak,' Ms Berejiklian said in a statement. Mr Howarth said he has been labelled a 'thug' but asserts he has never used excessive force in his arrests . 'Here in NSW we have been very clear that it is illegal for drivers to participate in what we call ""ride-sharing"" activities like Uber X. 'Roads and Maritime Services has issued several fines of thousands of dollars for those breaking the law and RMS will also be initiating legal action before the end of the year against motorists engaged in driving for Uber X.' A spokeswoman for NSW Roads and Maritime Services says Uber Pty Ltd does not breach the Passenger Transport Act 1990 by offering the service, but drivers transporting passengers for a fare do. 'Taxi and hire car services in NSW must be provided by an accredited operator authorised by Roads and Maritime,' she said. 'Authorised drivers have relevant criminal history and medical checks. This is to ensure the safety of customers and drivers.' The spokeswoman added that on the spot fines of between $500 and $1000 have been issued to drivers for offences including 'drive private hire vehicle without authority', but drivers could find themselves facing $110,000 fines before a court.","Russell Howarth, a limo driver, has 'arrested' eight UberX drivers in Sydney .

"If you have ever watched a dog drink water, you will know that it can be a splashy and messy affair. But until now scientists have not been exactly sure why, assuming that canines use their tongues like an inefficient ladle. High-speed cameras have now revealed that dogs ‘smash’ their tongues against the water to create water columns, which feed into their mouths. Scroll down for video . High-speed cameras have revealed that dogs ‘smash’ their tongues against the water to create water columns, which feed into their mouths (pictured) Scientists at Virginia Tech and Purdue University modelled the fluid dynamics at play when dogs of different sizes drink water. Dogs and cats have large jaws and ‘incomplete cheeks’ typical of a predatory quadruped, allowing to open their mouths wide to deliver killer blows. But what makes hunting possible also makes drinking using suction impossible. Unable to seal their cheeks completely, there is no way for a dog to suck up water, unlike humans, who have ‘complete’ cheeks, which allow us to create negative pressure and suck water into their mouths. Dogs can't such liquid due to their 'incomplete cheeks'. They smash their tongues on the water's surface to create splashes. When a dog withdraws its tongue from water, it creates a significant amount of acceleration - roughly five times that of gravity - that creates the water columns that feed up into its mouth. The columns of water ‘pinch off’ and detach from the water bath primarily due to gravity. Dogs are smart enough to close their mouths just before the water column collapses back to the bath, allowing them to drink. While cats lack suction too, they drink using a two part ‘water entry and exit’ process by placing the tip of their tongue on the water’s surface and rapidly withdrawing it to generate a column of water under their retracting tongue. Sunny Jung, an assistant professor at Virginia Tech, said: ‘When we started this project, we thought that dogs drink similarly to cats. 'But it turns out that it's different, because dogs smash their tongues on the water surface - they make lots of splashing - but a cat never does that.’ When a dog withdraws its tongue from water, it creates a significant amount of acceleration - roughly five times that of gravity - that creates the water columns that feed up into its mouth. To model this, Professor Jung placed cameras under the surface of a water trough to map the total surface area of the dogs' tongues that splashed down when drinking. The researchers found that heavier dogs drink water with the larger wetted area of the tongue. When dogs withdraw their tongue from water, they create a significant amount of acceleration - roughly five times that of gravity - that creates the water columns that feed up into their mouths. Canines are smart enough to close their mouths just before the water column collapses back again . This finding suggests that there’s a relationship between the water contact area of a dog's tongue and its body weight, so the volume of water a dog's tongue can move increases relative to its body size. In order to better understand how the physiology works, Professor Jung and his colleagues made models of different sized dogs’ tongues and mouths using glass tubes. This allowed them to mimic the acceleration and water column formation created when a dog splashes its tongue one water’s surface. They then measured the volume of water withdrawn. The scientists found that the column of water ‘pinches off’ and detaches from the water bath primarily due to gravity. This means that dogs are smart enough to close their mouths just before the water column collapses back to the bath - just like cats. They will today describe the findings at the American Physical Society's Division of Fluid Dynamics (DFD) meeting in San Francisco, California. Dogs and cats have large jaws and ‘incomplete cheeks’ typical of a predatory quadruped, allowing to open their mouths wide to deliver killer blows. But cats drinks differently to dogs and are more delicate . In 1940, Harold Edgerton discovered that when cats lap, they extend their tongues straight down toward the bowl with the tip of the tongue curled backwards, so that the top of the tongue touches the liquid first. Three years ago, a team from MIT, Virginia Tech and Princeton built upon his study by using high speed cameras to discover that the top of the cat's tongue is the only surface to touch liquid. Cats, unlike dogs, don’t dip their tongues into the liquid, so the cat’s lapping mechanism is far more subtle and elegant. The smooth tip of the tongue barely touches the surface of the liquid before the cat draws its tongue back up. As it does so, a column of liquid forms between the moving tongue and the liquid’s surface. The cat then closes its mouth, pinching off the top of the column for a nice drink, while keeping its chin dry. This part of the process is similar to how a dog drinks. Three years ago, a team from MIT, Virginia Tech and Princeton built upon his study by using high speed cameras to discover that the top of the cat's tongue is the only surface to touch liquid. A video referenced in the study is shown . When the cat’s tongue touches the liquid surface, some of the liquid sticks to it through liquid adhesion, much as water adheres to a human palm when it touches the surface of a pool. But the cat draws its tongue back up so rapidly that for a fraction of a second, inertia - the tendency of the moving liquid to continue following the tongue - overcomes gravity, which is pulling the liquid back down toward the bowl. The cat instinctively knows just when this delicate balance will change and it closes its mouth in the instant before gravity overtakes inertia. If the cat hesitates, the column will break, so that the liquid would fall back into the bowl and the tongue would come up empty. While the domestic cat averages about four laps per second, big cats, such as tigers, know to slow down. Because their tongues are larger, they lap more slowly to achieve the same balance of gravity and inertia.","Scientists at Virginia Tech and Purdue University modelled fluid dynamics at play when dogs drink water - and it's different to a cat's technique .

"Security officials made a string of blunders in tracking the fanatics who butchered Lee Rigby, an official report said yesterday. Agents dismissed Michael Adebolajo as a drug dealer who was not a threat to national security weeks before the merciless killing outside Woolwich barracks in London in May 2013. By that time, Adebolajo and his accomplice Michael Adebowale had featured in seven MI5 investigations. Following a series of errors, including paperwork delays, neither of the Muslim converts was under intrusive surveillance at the time of the murder. Scroll down for video . Lee Rigby's killers Michael Adebolajo (left) and Michael Adebowale. Agents dismissed Adebolajo as a drug dealer who wasn't a threat to national security weeks before the killing outside Woolwich barracks in London . Officers from the security service had closed their operation against Adebolajo on April 11, 2013 – just six weeks before the atrocity – and suggested police should instead arrest him for drugs. Incredibly, however, the Metropolitan Police lost the number of his house so no further action was taken. The unnamed officer in Romford who took the decision said his address would be too hard to find. The log reads: ‘Closed… cannot find number… and this is a long road.’ In the case of Adebowale, he first came to the attention of MI5 in August 2011 after studying hate-filled extremist material on the internet. However, it took eight months for officials to start investigating him – three months to find his name, followed by five months of ‘inaction’. Murdered: British soldier Lee Rigby, of 2nd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers. Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale were found guilty in December 2013 of murdering Rigby, despite Adebolajo's claims that he was a 'soldier of Allah' and that the killing was an act of war . In its report, the Commons Intelligence and Security Committee said there was no excuse for the delay, though it conceded it did not have an impact on the final outcome. There were similar delays in mounting more detailed surveillance after the security services received intelligence in March 2013 that Adebowale was handing out extremist material. It took more than a month to complete the paperwork, which was sent backwards and forwards between MI5 lawyers and staff – only being completed one day before the killing. Theresa May, the Home Secretary, was finally able to sign the warrant as an ‘urgent application’ only in the hours after Fusilier Rigby had been butchered. The 191-page report contains a string of redactions – but glosses over the attempts made by MI5 to recruit Adebolajo as an informant. Yesterday, David Cameron said there were ‘lessons to be learned’. Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale  speaking to a member of the public near the murder site . He told MPs that £130million would be invested into the security services to help identify lone wolf terrorists. The ISC, which had access to hundreds of pages of secret intelligence, identified at least four missed opportunities to uncover more evidence about the threat the men posed. MI5 had linked both Adebolajo and Adebowale to Anjem Choudary’s extremist al-Muhajiroun group and its various offshoots. Adebolajo cropped up in five inquiries, two of which were priority one investigations – the most serious classification. Yet neither MI5 or MI6 was aware that he had travelled to Kenya in November 2010, where he was arrested on suspicion of attempting to travel to Somalia to join the terror group Al Shabaab. MI6, in particular, comes under blistering attack from the ISC for showing little interest in the fact a British national had been stopped as a possible ‘jihadi tourist’. However the MPs said: ‘We have concluded that, given what the agencies knew at the time, they were not in a position to prevent the murder of Fusilier Rigby.’","Agents dismissed Michael Adebolajo as a drug dealer who was not a threat to national security .

"Barbie is no longer the most popular girl in the toy store. For the past 11 years, the Mattel doll has been top of the Christmas gift list for parents of girls. But she has been knocked into the No.2 spot by the Disney film Frozen. Scroll down for video . For 11 years, Barbie (right) doll had been top of Christmas list for parents of girls. Now, Frozen is No.1 (left) with one in five parents buying merchandise from film . Around one in five parents are planning to buy an item of merchandise from the animated film for their daughters, according to the annual Holiday Top Toys survey from America's National Retail Federation. While 20 per cent of parents are relying on the children's film to bring a smile to their girl's face on Christmas morning, 16 per cent of mothers and fathers are still planning on purchasing a Barbie - it is the first time in the survey's history that the brand has been beaten. The Frozen film has taken the world by storm since its release in November last year. By June, it had already made $1.2 billion (£765,198,768) worldwide at the box office, making it the fifth highest-grossing film of all time. The movie's catchy soundtrack has sold more than a million copies and been streamed more than eight million times on Spotify, it has also spawned numerous copycat videos on YouTube of children singing with their parents. The Frozen film has taken the world by storm since its release in November last year . The success didn't just translate to sales figures though - UK parenting website Babycentre reported earlier this year that the name Elsa had gone from No.331 in the list of girls' baby names to No.88. While Frozen has proved a hit with children around the world, the plot-line was also attractive to the parents. Much has been made of Elsa and Anna being good role models for young girls, with their strong personalities and their close bond of sisterhood. And now, the popularity of the film means it is expected to dominate the toy market too. While the success of Elsa and her frozen friends has been undoubtedly created by the movie, Barbie has also had a difficult year in terms of press. The doll's makers have tried hard to bring the doll into the 21st century, with versions of the toy including Business Barbie and a 'Share A Smile Becky' doll that featured Barbie in a wheelchair. Mattel have tried hard to bring the doll into the 21st century, with versions of the toy including Business Barbie (right) and a 'Share A Smile Becky' doll that featured Barbie in a wheelchair. (left) But Mattel has still been marred by criticism that Barbie's figure is completely out of proportion to a normal woman, therefore creating unrealistic standards for young girls. They also attracted negative publicity earlier this month for a book called 'Barbie: I Can Be A Computer Engineer,' which actually showed Barbie needing the help of her male friends to do the job. The response to the book was so negative that Mattel was forced to removed the product from shelves and promise that it would only write story-lines in the future that would inspire girls. With its distinctive pink packaging, Barbie will also have been hit by the recent argument for toy stores to move away from gender stereotypes for children. 1: Disney Frozen 20.0% . 2: Barbie 16.8% . 3: Dolls 10.7% . 4: Monster High 5.2% . 5: American Girl 3.8% . 6: LEGO 3.1% . 7: Tablet/Apple iPad 3.0% . 8: My Little Pony 2.1% . 9: Disney Doc McStuffins 1.9% . 10: Apparel 1.8% . 1: LEGO 14.2% . 2: Cars & Trucks 8.1% . 3: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 7.7% . 4: Video Games 7.5% . 5: Hot Wheels 4.6% . 6: Xbox One 4.4% . 7: PlayStation 4 4.2% . 8: Transformers 3.5% . 9: Remote Controlled Vehicle 2.7% . 10: Marvel Action Figures 2.3% .

NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay said: 'Parents will not have to go far to find good deals on the toys their children have put at the top of their lists.

"France on Tuesday pushed back 'until further notice' the delivery of a controversial warship to Russia because of the Ukraine crisis, sparking a measured initial response from Moscow. President Francois Hollande said in a statement that the 'current situation in eastern Ukraine still does not allow for the delivery of the first' of two Mistral-class vessels France has built for Russia. 'He therefore decided to delay until further notice' the decision on whether to grant the export licence needed to deliver the ship to Russia, the statement added. Russia has reportedly warned Paris of 'serious' consequences unless France delivers the first of the two Mistral-class helicopter carriers by the end of November. Scroll down for video . Still waiting: Russian sailors stand in formation in front of the Mistral-class helicopter carrier Vladivostok at the STX Les Chantiers de l'Atlantique shipyard site in Saint-Nazaire, western France . President Francois Hollande said in a statement that the 'current situation in eastern Ukraine still does not allow for the delivery of the first' of two Mistral-class vessels France has built for Russia . But Moscow's reaction was relatively calm after Hollande's announcement, with Deputy Defence Minister Yury Borisov saying Russia did not immediately intend to file a claim against France for breach of contract. 'We'll wait patiently... So far we are not filing a claim anywhere,' Borisov told RIA Novosti news agency. The first of the two assault ships - which can carry 16 helicopters, four landing crafts, 13 tanks, 450 soldiers and a hospital - was supposed to be delivered earlier this month, according to the original deal signed in 2011. But amid the Ukraine conflict and the rapid decline in the West's relations with Russia, France has come under intense pressure from its allies, particularly the United States, and in September postponed the delivery. The Russian navy frigate Smolny is seen at the STX Les Chantiers de l'Atlantique shipyard site in Saint-Nazaire . could be liable for hefty fines if it breaches the 1.2-billion-euro ($1.5-billion) contract with Russia . Several dozen sailors could be seen this afternoon training or jogging on the harbour nearby while the vast grey vessel Vladivostok remained anchored just offshore . A source close to the case said Hollande's announcement was tied to the deadline for the contract, without revealing further details. Paris faces a serious dilemma over the Mistrals. It could be liable for hefty fines if it breaches the 1.2-billion-euro ($1.5-billion) contract. But it would also risk the wrath of its allies around the world if it were to deliver the hot-button technology to Russia at a time when Moscow is in the diplomatic deep-freeze over the Ukraine unrest. 'Whatever our future decision, half of the world will have it in for us,' a top-level French official who declined to be named said earlier this month. Given an economy that is barely moving forward, France is unwilling to have two enormous white elephants on its hands and no cash to show for it. Tense: Soldiers stand guard in front of the entrance of the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar people  in Simferopol . Aerial footage shows how Donetsk Airport has become a deserted wasteland and a crucial battleground . Selling the ships to another client is not possible as Russian technology has already been installed on board, which Moscow would not want any other country to have and which in any case is not technically compatible with Western military systems. Also weighing on the French decision is its reliability as an arms export partner as it seeks to sell Rafale jets to countries such as India. A well-placed source in the Russian defence ministry told the Interfax agency: 'We have no doubt that we'll get these helicopter carriers. France has even more interest than we do in delivering them.' 'We can do without them but what will France do with them? That's the question,' added this source, who said the contract allowed for a three-month delay that would push the final deadline back to mid-February. However, Borisov told the ITAR-TASS news agency that if France ultimately refused to hand over the ship, Russia would 'go to court and impose fines'. 'Everything is written in the contract. We will act according to the wording of the contract, like all civilised people,' Borisov said. France had hoped that a ceasefire agreement signed in September would pave the way for a clear-conscience delivery of the Mistral but conditions on the ground in eastern Ukraine have since deteriorated, with the West pointing the finger at Russia. Meanwhile, some 400 Russian sailors currently being trained in Saint-Nazaire in western France, where the shipyard is located, continue to kick their heels until their fate is decided. Several dozen sailors could be seen this afternoon training or jogging on the harbour nearby while the vast grey vessel Vladivostok remained anchored just offshore, its nose pointing out to sea but, for the moment, going nowhere.","Russia has delivered measured response to being denied warship .

"The sound of an alarm is bad enough at the best of times, but hearing your partner’s alarm - especially when you don’t have to be up - can be a major source of irritation. Hush earplugs aim to solve this problem by only playing the alarm directly in the wearer’s ears. The smart buds link to an app via Bluetooth to play soothing music, and block out external noises such as a busy road, or someone’s snoring. Scroll down for video . The Hush earplugs were built by San Diego-based engineers. They connect to an app via Bluetooth and the earplugs play soothing music to help wearers get to sleep, while blocking external noises. And when it’s time to get up, the alarm sounds directly in the earbuds, without disturbing anyone else . Hush earplugs were created by three engineering students from San Diego. The whole process from design to sale has taken 11 months and the trio has launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund production of the plugs. To block out noise, Hush is fitted with sound eliminating foam and uses noise masking to isolate the wearer from external sounds. An app is hoping to put people in a good mood in the morning by making them smile to switch off their alarm. Dubbed ‘Smile Clock’, the app requires users to grin into their smartphone camera before its incessant buzzing is turned off. The camera tracks key features on a user’s face and then determines whether that person is happy enough to be allowed out of bed. It even helps the user crack a genuine smile by showing pre-selected images, or playing songs designed to make someone’s day. They are either silent, or can be programmed using the app to play a variety of sounds from white noise, to ocean waves and a crackling fire. And when it’s time to get up, the smartphone's alarm plays the sound through the earbuds, without disturbing anyone else. Additionally, users can customise notifications so they are always woken up in an emergency, when a certain contact calls or sends a message. ‘Two of the most popular methods of dealing with noise disturbances when you're trying to sleep are earplugs and sound machines,’ explained the firm. ‘However, earplugs have physical limitations in blocking out sound because even when your canal is completely sealed off, sound still gets through to the eardrum by conducting through your bones. ‘Similarly, sound machines are limited in how much sound they can mask as they can only be played so loudly until they become a deterrent to sleep themselves.’ To block out noise, Hush plugs (pictured) are fitted with sound eliminating foam and uses noise masking to isolate the wearer from external sounds. They are either silent, or can be programmed using the app to play a variety of sounds from white noise, to ocean waves and a crackling fire . The whole process from design to sale has taken 11 months and the trio has launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund production of the buds and charger (pictured). The plugs can be pre-ordered for $100 (£64 a pair), and are expected to ship internationally in May 2015 .

Daniel Lee, Hush’s chief executive, said: ‘We have launched a new way for people to deal with noise, perhaps the most significant deterrent to sleep. ‘As engineering students living in dorms, we often found our sleep distracted by a variety of noises. ‘Hush's smart earplugs allow for a better night's sleep with the ability to hear important notifications.’ And, if the Hush plugs fall out or are lost, they can be tracked using the app.","The smart Hush earplugs were built by San Diego-based Hush .

"An Australian model has taken a stand after a swimwear label used pictures of her without permission and Photoshopped her to appear considerably slimmer than she is in real life. Meaghan Kausman, 23, a fashion student from Melbourne, was photographed in an underwater shoot with photographer Pip Summerville two weeks ago wearing a Fella Swim bikini. Ms Summerville shared some photographs from the shoot on Instagram and the next day she and Ms Kausman were shocked to find that Fella Swim had posted a Photoshopped version of one of the pictures that made Ms Kausman appear kilograms lighter than she does in real life. Scroll down for video . Spot the difference: Meaghan Kausman was shocked when a photograph taken in an underwater shoot was reposted by a swimwear company after they had Photoshopped her body to make it appear much slimmer . 'My jaw literally dropped,' Ms Kausman told Daily Mail Australia. 'Straight away I messaged Pip… we were incredibly disappointed that they took the photo without permission. They took something and altered it because they didn't see it as beautiful,' she said. Swimwear label Fella Swim had sent Ms Kausman a bikini to use for the shoot but no money changed hands, with neither Ms Kausman nor Ms Summerville being paid for the photographs. Ms Kausman decided to speak out about what had occurred and uploaded side-by-side pictures comparing the original image with the Photoshopped one and wrote a post criticising the changes. 'They had drastically altered my body, thinning out my stomach and thighs in an attempt to box me into the cultural ideal of beauty,' she wrote. 'My body is a size 8, not a size 4. That's my body! I refuse to stand by and allow ANY company or person to perpetuate the belief that ""thinner is better"". All women are beautiful, and we come in different shapes and sizes! It is NOT OKAY to alter a woman's body to make it look thinner. EVER!' Meaghan Kausman is a part-time model as well as studying fashion at RMIT in Melbourne . The photographer, Pip Summerville, who is considering legal action against the swimwear company for breach of copyright, told Daily Mail Australia that she was 'blown away' when she saw the retouched image. 'They didn't ask for my permission [and] it completely changed the image, it just destroyed Meaghan's appearance. They basically cut her in half and biologically speaking that's not what a human body would look like in that position,' she said. Ms Kausman said she contacted Fella Swim before publishing the comparison shots to Instagram and did not want to shame the company, but when she did not hear back from them she decided to go public with her grievance. 'Unfortunately there has not been a response from Fella [Swim]. It's really upsetting. I would never want to shame a company or embarrass someone,' she added.

They added the company does not promote a negative body image or believe in glamourising skinny models - saying they make swimwear for a variety of body shapes and often post pictures of models not wearing makeup. 'There was no way, ever meant to be a negative connotation derived from the image, and the intention of re-posting the image was to draw attention to the beauty of the shot, and encourage others to also follow and support Meaghan and Pip's work,' the statement read. Ms Kausman, whose father is Dr Rick Kausman, a prominent advocate for healthy body image, told Daily Mail Australia she is pleased to have been able to speak out about body image on behalf of other women. 'People have been so appreciative. I got a couple of emails from people suffering eating disorders saying thank you. I'm so thankful that people are supportive,' she said.

"A 17-year-old Florida high school student recruited her schoolmates for a prostitution ring and coordinated the trysts on Facebook, charging $50 to $100 in cash and alcohol, police revealed today. Alexa Nicole De Armas has been charged with felony human trafficking after a Friday arrest in Venice, near Sarasota on Florida's Gulf Coast. John Michael Mosher, 21, also was arrested Friday. Police say he paid $40 and a bottle of liquor to have sex with a 15-year-old girl, who allegedly did not want to participate in the encounter. Traffic: Alexa De Armas (left), 17, has been charged with felony human trafficking, and 21-year-old John Mosher (right) has been arrested on a charge of sexual battery with a victim older than 15 . 'Mastermind': De Armas is accused of being the leader of a Florida sex trafficking ring recruiting high school girls for prostitution . Break in the case: Four students at Venice High School (pictured) told administrators last month that De Armas wanted them to work for her as prostitutes . Mosher is charged with felony sexual battery on a victim older than 12. He is being held without bond and has been ordered to have no contact with the victim or the 17-year-old suspected madame. Police Capt. Tom Mattmuller told the Sarasota Herald-Tribune hat a third arrest is expected later in the day Tuesday. The alleged sex trafficking ring first came to light in October after four students at Venice High School told administrators that De Armas, a student at Sarasota High, and a male student from their school wanted them to join, according to police. About the same time, police looked into reports of a Riverview High School student's involvement with Mosher. De Armas and at least one other student are said to have come up with a plan over the summer to prostitute other teens for money and alcohol. Police documents indicate that the ring leader, Miss De Armas, arranged for Mosher to have sex with the 15-year-old girl in a community pool shed on Colonial Lane in Nokomis in August. 'She stated she told Mosher she did not want to have sexual intercourse with him to which he disregarded and forcefully held her against the wall of the pool shed building, restricting her movement and ability to flee,' charging documents stated. 'Cyber-madame': Investigators say De Armas used her Facebook account to coordinate sexual encounters with clients . Businesswoman: The teenager allegedly discussed with her accomplice online prices for various sexual services . According to his Facebook page, Mosher, a native of Illinois, works as a dishwasher at Fins at Sharky's on the Pier in Venice. Police say no activity took place on school property. Students told officers that De Armas coordinated at least three prostitution deals — including the one with Mosher — through Facebook private messaging, according to police. 'Why pimp out old h*** when I have fresh young h*** I can give up for money?' De Armas allegedly wrote online. 'As long as I'm getting paid I'm trafficking all these (expletive).' Police said that a search warrant was issued for the 17-year-old's Facebook account and that they found conversations between potential clients and participants, along with details of how the transactions would be made. Client: Mosher, a dishwasher at a Venice restaurant, allegedly paid $40 and a bottle of liquor to have sex with a 15-year-old girl . Crime scene: The illicit tryst between Mosher and the teenage girl took place at a community pool in Nokomis . Investigators reportedly found online exchanges between De Armas and her accomplice discussing prices for various services: $50 to $70 for oral sex and $100 for sex with a virgin. Following Mosher's alleged sexual encounter with the 15-year-old, De Armas and her unnamed business partner began trying to expand their recruitment operation to bring in more girls for prospective clients. According to witness accounts, De Armas and her accomplice planned to use the money paid by johns to buy drugs.","Alexa De Armas, 17, from Venice, Florida, charged with felony human trafficking .

"The Senate Democrats' top message man said Tuesday that his party erred five years ago by putting the Obamacare law ahead of economic priorities. At a Washington news conference, New York Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer conceded that the vast majority of Americans were relatively happy with their employer-provided health insurance in 2009. The health care overhaul's message, Schumer explained, was aimed at about 5 per cent of the electorate: those who lacked insurance and who voted. 'To aim a huge change in mandate at such a small percentage of the electorate made no political sense,' he said. Scroll down for video . Uber-liberal New York Sen. Charles Schumer, the Senate's third-ranking Democrat, said at the National Press Club that his party was too intent on passing the Affordable Care Act in 2009 instead of focusing on jobs and the economy . AMBITIONS: Schumer's name is being floated as a possible successor to Sen. Harry Reid when he gives up the Democrats' top leadership position . He said he expressed such concerns at the time. His office later told the Associated Press that he 'expressed those concerns privately to fellow Democrats.' Schumer is now urging the Democratic Party to tilt leftward in the wake of crushing midterm election losses, saying 'working Americans' want a robust government that will promote education access, labor bargaining rights, progressive taxes and more. His remarks came a few weeks after Republicans won control of the Senate and boosted their House majority in the midterm elections. He said the way back to influence on Capitol Hill is to appeal to voters who support 'an active and forceful government' to help them cope with globalization, technology and other forces keeping middle incomes stagnant. Schumer said Democrats made it easier for Republicans to paint government as bloated and inept with 'the rollout of the Obamacare exchanges, the mishandling of the surge in border crossers, ineptitude at the VA (Veterans' Administration) and the government's initial handling of the Ebola threat.' Schumer is one of the Senate's most senior and ambitious Democrats. He oversaw the party's campaign efforts in two highly successful elections, 2006 and 2008, and he now chairs the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee. Some see him as a potential successor to Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada. His comments Tuesday could upset those who say it was wise to make the health care overhaul the first major legislative initiative after President Barack Obama's 2008 election. And Republicans quickly ridiculed his call for a more robust federal government. 'The failure of big-government liberalism is why liberals were overwhelmingly rebuked at the polls this month,' said the conservative group YG Network. ODD REFLECTION: In a 2007 book, Schumer called for lower taxes and a reduction in the number of illegal immigrants in America . In a lengthy speech Tuesday, Schumer repeatedly said Democrats must not run away from an active government. 'The 2014 election was not a repudiation of government in general,' he said, but 'just another sign of a deep frustration that government is not doing enough to fix our country's problems.' Schumer said he and other Democrats will propose specific policies later, but he hinted at several likely areas. He called for making college more affordable; making taxes progressive, or proportionately higher on upper incomes; spending more on infrastructure such as roads and bridges; and 'changing labor laws so workers can demand more pay.' Schumer reflected Democratic divisions over expanded trade agreements. He called for 'negotiating good trade policies that prevent jobs from going overseas.' He said most voters feel 'trade has hurt wages significantly' by encouraging imports from low-income countries.","New York Sen. Chuck Schumer said going all-in on the Affordable Care Act at the beginning on the Obama presidency 'made no political sense'
Most people were happy with their medical insurance already, he said .
Strategy was to earn appreciation from those who weren't, and who were likely voters .
That group, said Schumer, was only about 5 per cent of the electorate ."

"New launch: Illegal Magazine is being sold on the streets of London and vendors use the cash raised to pay for drugs . A new Big Issue-inspired magazine sold by drug addicts who can use the £2 profit on each issue  to fund their habit was today criticised by police. 'Illegal!' was launched in east London last week and argues everyone 'has a right' to do what they want with their bodies - even if that means an illegal 'acid trip in Camden' or an 'ecstasy-fuelled night in Shoreditch'. Sellers, who pay £1.50 per copy, charge £3.50 for it and can tell buyers they will 'more than likely spend the money on drugs'. Buyers can 'help make them a bit less criminal', the founders say. But it is not clear whether the sellers or the magazine's proprietors are breaking the law. Following the magazine's launch last week, one drug addict sold 100 copies in a few days, pocketing £350. Its Danish founder Michael Lodberg Olsen has said giving drug addicts access to the magazine will help them get money 'beyond theft and prostitution'. Louis Jensen, head of Illegal!’s team in London, told MailOnline he met Mr Olsen while filming a documentary - and decided he wanted to bring the magazine to Britain. Mr Jensen, 26, said: ‘The whole war on drugs is something I've kept a close eye on over the last few years. I really like Michael's ethos, and thought education is lacking in the UK - not just on the drug itself, but how to take it, and on drug users. ‘He'd always had this dream that he wanted to take it to globally - and I said to Michael, “I want to take this to London, let's do this”. ‘There's many misconceptions about drug users. This magazine challenges those misconceptions and stereotypes. It's not necessarily there to create a revenue to spend it on drugs. Campaign: Illegal! founder Michael Lodberg Olsen, centre, with the mayor of Copenhagen, where his magazine is widely sold to help drug addicts there . ‘Michael is creating an alternative to crime and prostitution to generate revenue. He knows at the end of the day that they probably will spend this on drugs, but at least they've been given the option to sell something that doesn't cause them to commit crime. ‘He's a realist, and I'm a realist. We want to hope that the user reads the content and takes certain things on board, and hopefully gets themselves out of the hole they're in - but you know nine out of the ten are probably going to spend it on drugs. There’s that real hope that the one in ten won't.’ He added: ‘I want to create a conversation. Current drug policies clearly don't work. Drug-related crime on the increase. This shouldn't be a judicial issue. This is an educational issue. ‘I've been known to take drugs in the past, but more on a recreational level - it's never something that's been a dependency for me. 'One of my very close friends happens to be a heavy user, and he is a vendor who sells the magazine in Brixton. I think being involved in this magazine has helped him.’ Mr Olsen added: 'We don’t think the magazine breaks any laws. We have told people that, if someone is unhappy about the magazine being sold near a particular place, then they should move on and not cause any problem.' Illegal! has sold  around 15,000 copies in Copenhagen and last week 2,000 copies of the English language version of the magazine were handed out to drug addicts in London, who sell them on the street. The magazine's foreword states: 'Everyone has a right to do with their body as they wish and, if that means a two-day acid trip in Camden or an ecstasy-fuelled night in Shoreditch, then so be it. What we lack is education. Welcome to Illegal! magazine in London.' Mr Olsen, editor-in-chief, admitted that he has not yet talked to Scotland Yard about the magazine, but said he was 'planning on doing so'. Chief Inspector Ian Simpkins, of the Metropolitan Police, said he was 'not a big fan' of the idea. He said: 'We would always wish to reduce crime and the generators for crime, which funding a drug habit often is of course. This initiative seeks to legitimise and formalise fundraising for illegal drug use which I'm not sure is the answer. Launch: Illegal! is being sold in east London and one seller is said to have pocketed £350 so far . 'There is always the risk here of funding and consequently increasing a person's drug use to the point where the selling of the magazine no longer covers the cost or the initiative fails, so you're back to square one, or worse because you're now consuming more drugs with all the health and crime risks that poses.' MailOnline has asked Scotland Yard if they are investigating whether selling the magazine constitutes illegal activity, but the force is yet to respond. Illegal! magazine states in its blurb: 'Whether you smoke dried leaves, sniff coke, inject heroin or neck all the pills you can buy from a pensioner on the street, it's no concern to the police or the prison service, it's a health and social concern. 'Illegal! magazine is a helping hand to those drug users who have become dependent and forced into criminality or prostitution to get their next fix. 'They sell the magazine on the streets of Copenhagen and now London. That's their job. Help them - buy the magazine and make them a bit less criminal.' Mr Olsen, however, said the aim of the magazine was to spark a debate about drug use. He said: 'We are challenging the war on drugs. The magazine is about the drug culture, good and bad. The point is that anyone can sell this magazine and we hope that it will spark a debate about drug use. 'We can't just ignore that drugs are everywhere and there are heavy drug users on the streets who often fund their habit through theft or prostitution. This offers them an alternative. It is about breaking the cycle between drug use and crime.' Shoreditch resident Jake Furness said the 'very idea' of drug addicts selling magazines on the street specifically to fund their drug addiction was 'ridiculous'. The 32-year-old IT worker said: 'The whole idea will just lead to a vicious circle of an ever-increasing dependency on drugs. 'Drugs are still illegal in the UK and to blatantly sell magazines which are designed to help fund the purchase of drugs is frankly ridiculous.' Debra Greaves, 41, said: 'I'll happily buy the Big Issue as it aims to help people, but this magazine is just a money spinner for drug addicts to get more drugs. 'The legality of the whole operation must be questionable and I certainly won't be buying a copy.'","Copenhagen-based Illegal! has started selling issues in east London .

"A spectator who witnessed Australian cricketer Phil Hughes being struck by a ball that saw the sportsman rushed into emergency surgery has described the moment as 'chilling'.

'I have still goosebumps. It was chilling,' Dempsey told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Phil Hughes was hit by a cricket ball and collapsed face first on the pitch at Sydney Cricket Grounds . 'There was this crack that echoed through the grounds. It was an eerie feeling, you knew something wasn't right. 'It didn't sound like leather hitting hard metal, it looked like a bouncer crept under his grill.' Dempsey said as soon as Hughes hit the ground players ran to assist him, with wicketkeeper Brad Haddin rolling his teammate on to his side and doctors following close behind. 'Tom Cooper and David Warner stayed by his side for more than half an hour,' Dempsey said. He was hit following a brutal bouncer from South Australia's Sean Abbott on Tuesday . Nine News reporter Will Dempsey was there to witness the moment and said players rushed to Hughes' side . 'They worked on Phil for around 45 minutes. 'There was dead silence at the grounds. No one in the stands spoke or move. No one left, unless they were moving closer to Hughes to help.' Dempsey said Hughes' teammates were distraught over the incident, which happened on day one of the Sheffield Shield between New South Wales and South Australia on Tuesday. 'Steve O'Keefe came off the ground crying. Hughes was loaded into one of two ambulances. It appeared that the helicopter landed at Paddington Barracks,' the spectator said. 'Steve Smith came to the stands, visibly distressed. 'Speaking with Moises Henriques and Mark Waugh, Steve motioned to indicate that Phil had been hit underneath his jawline.' Phil Hughes lays on a stretcher after being struck in the head during day one of the Sheffield Shield match between New South Wales and South Australia . Dempsey said Sean Abbott - who had bowled the ball that struck Hughes - remained in the dressing room the entire time, while players comforted each other with many crying. 'It was the second ball to hit a player in five overs. It was fast bowling but Abbott's ball to Hughes was a bit sharper than usual,' Dempsey said. The scene was total chaos as Hughes was taken away in an ambulance. 'The ambulance changed direction to avoid the crowds. People and guards were yelling at people who were trying to take photos of Phil as they loaded him into the ambulance,' Dempsey said. 'Umpires were shouting ""get away, get away"" 'David Warner had been at Phil's side and walked up to his fiancee and daughter in the stands for a warm hug - he was really upset.' NSW Blues assistant coach Geoff Lawson told 702 ABC radio he had never seen something like this before during his career in cricket. 'The ball was rising, his head's going away to the right, and it's hit him just on the back of the head under the helmet,' he said. 'The consequences of the injury I've probably never seen in my lengthy time in the game. Pretty quickly you could see he was in trouble. He fell over... and the way he collapsed was quite alarming. 'The fieldsman worked it out in a few seconds and signaled to the dressing room immediately.

"A man making a hospital visit has been left horrified after a strange woman pushed a trash bag on him which contained a blood-soaked baby boy.

He said: 'I didn't think she was talking to me, so I walked over there and she was like, ""You need to take that bag inside."" 'She was nervous, she was scratching her arms and forearms, I guess she was kind of nervous.' The woman then jumped back in her car and sped off. The young man took the plastic bag to a nurse who opened it to find the newborn baby inside. The Safe Haven Law allows an individual to give up a baby with no questions asked and without fear of being prosecuted.

Mothers unable to cope are often under severe emotional distress and this law allows them a way out from actions that may be committed in fear or desperation. The law was introduced in Texas in 1999 and now each state in the U.S. has a slightly different version of the legislation. Visit safehaven.tv for more information.

They aren't usually harmful to humans, although if they are alive, they can bite. Cymothoa Exigua is more commonly known as the tongue-eating louse and is a parasite, which attaches itself to the tongue of a fish. It enters the fish through its gills before attaching itself to the tongue. It then replaces the tongue and feeds on the blood of the fish as well as any other food that it takes in. The parasite can bite humans but is not thought to be harmful to them in any other way. Mr Poli, of Llanon, South Wales said: 'It was disgusting - I love fish but it's put me off it for life now.

"A nurse who was diagnosed with Ebola has asked the bridal shop that was forced to close for weeks after her visit for a $480 refund on her bridesmaid dresses. Amber Vinson, who has since recovered, was working in Dallas, Texas when she contracted the disease but - unaware she had it - she traveled to Cleveland, Ohio to plan her wedding. She went to Coming Attractions Bridal & Formal in Akron with her bridesmaids and put in an order - but her visit later forced the shop to close for weeks, losing the owners tens of thousands of dollars. Her attorney has now asked that the shop refund her bridesmaids the $479.89 they paid for their dresses, the Akron Beacon Journal reported. Demands: Amber Vinson, a nurse who was diagnosed with Ebola in Texas last month, has asked for a bridal shop to give her a refund - even though her visit cost the shop tens of thousands of dollars . Attorney Stephen Malouf said Vinson saw the publicity of her case harm the store and decided to get bridesmaids' dresses elsewhere to avoid further scrutiny for the business. But owner Anna Younker said Vinson's change of heart and the refund request feel like 'a slap in the face' after the shop lost tens of thousands of dollars because of its connection to her. 'This is like the icing on the cake for her to ask,' she told the Beacon Journal. 'By canceling completely because she wants to go somewhere else, that's like a slap in the face to me.' Malouf said that wasn't Vinson's intention. 'I'm sorry that the shop is upset,' he said. 'This was an effort to help the shop and Amber. ... This was a purely innocent request and I'm sorry it wasn't received in the spirit in which it was sent.' Precautions: Two men in hazmat suits are seen inside the bridal store following the Ebola scare last month . Loss: The store, pictured, was forced to close for weeks after her visit and other customers were monitored . Younker said she occasionally makes exceptions to her store's usual policy against refunds, but that it's not feasible in this case. 'It doesn't make sense,' Younker said. 'I'm out a lot of money.' Hurt: Store owner Anna Younker, pictured, said the refund request felt like 'a slap in the face' She said if Vinson had called her and explained why they wanted to go elsewhere, she might have considered helping her, but she said she has not heard from the bride-to-be. Vinson was the second nurse at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital to be diagnosed with Ebola after they both cared for Thomas Eric Duncan, who later died of the disease. After treating him, she flew to Ohio to prepare for her upcoming wedding to former football player Derrick Markray. While in Ohio, she learned that one of her colleagues, Nina Pham, had been diagnosed with Ebola - so she called Texas Health before boarding her return flight and was cleared to travel, she said. It was only once she landed back in Dallas after the weekend trip that she discovered that she had a temperature of 100.3F and reported to the hospital. Since she was hospitalized, a gofundme page has raised more than $23,000 for her. Vinson's  diagnosis led to several weeks of health monitoring for more than 160 people in Ohio - including people who had been at the bridal shop. None showed symptoms. At the height of the watch period, more than 160 Ohio residents — including customers who visited the bridal shop at the same time — were monitored by public health officials for symptoms.","Amber Vinson visited Coming Attractions Bridal in Akron last month after traveling to Ohio for the weekend after treating an Ebola patient .

"A young woman has told how a gang of men blackmailed her into having sex with them when she was 13 years old, by threatening to burn her younger brother alive. The vulnerable schoolgirl was also sold to other men for sex from the age of 12 until she was15, under threat that the Oxford gang would hurt her family, a court heart today. Nine men deny 51 counts, including rape, trafficking and organising prostitution involving six schoolgirls, some as young as 11. On trial: The accused, seen in court today, allegedly sexually exploited Girl A and five other school girls and deny 51counts, including trafficking and rape . Now aged 21, she told a jury at the Old Bailey that she was pressured into having sex with three of the defendants, Kamar Jamil, Akhtar Dogar and Anjum Dogar. The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said she was repeatedly raped and sold for sex between 2004 and 2007 under threat of violence towards her family. ‘I was scared because they were grown men and I was a child. ‘They would say things like “we'll come and get you and burn your house down” to frighten me. They said they'd burn my brother alive.’ Noel Lucas QC, prosecuting, asked: ‘Did you believe them?’ ‘At the time, yes, I was very frightened,’ she answered. Accused: In the dock at an earlier hearing, (left to right) Kamar Jamil, Akhtar Dogar, Anjun Dogar, Assad Hussain, Mohammed Karrar, Bassan A Karrar, Mohammed T Hussain, Shan Ahmed and Balel Ahmed . Jamil, . 27, and the Dogar brothers, Akhtar, 32, and Anjum, 30, are accused of . raping and organising the abuse of the woman known as Girl A. A . fourth defendant, Assad Hussain, 32, is alleged to have been one of the . men who paid to have sex with her knowing she was under age. 'Girl . A', who chose to give evidence in court in view of the accused rather . than from behind a curtain, said she met three of them shortly after her . thirteenth birthday in 2004. Initially, . she told the court, the men were nice to her and would buy her presents . and offer her alcohol and cannabis. ‘Then they started asking for . sexual favours,’ she said. She . told the court they wanted oral sex at first but soon demanded full sex . before they began taking her to a number of locations, including hotel . rooms, bedsits and parks, to have sex with strangers. ‘Because I liked them at the start I felt obliged. I felt like I owed it to them, like that was what I was supposed to do. ‘They . made it sound like it was a party, like it was supposed to be fun, and . in my childish naivety I believed these men were coming for a good time, . a good time being a laugh. I didn't necessarily think that they would . expect to have sex with me,’ she said. Case: Girl A was the second alleged victim to give evidence at the Old Bailey, with four young girls remaining . As time went by the victim, now 21, . said she began to resent herself but did as they said because their . threats to hurt her family were 'always in the back of my mind.' ‘All the time they were treating me like a piece of meat that they could just tread all over. ‘But . I got into the mindset that if a man wanted it, I was just supposed to . give it. That probably sounds quite difficult to understand but that's . how it was. 'I had no dignity left, no self-respect. I just gave them . what they wanted,’ she added. Jurors heard she suffered so much at the hands of the men she cannot even remember the first time she was abused by them. ‘Sometimes . there would be one or two guys then more would turn up. They would take . you to places and basically do what they wanted to you,’ she said. Asked . why she thought the men were interested in someone her age, she said: . ‘I didn't think of it like that at the time. I thought it was because . they liked me. ‘Looking . back I suppose I was seeking friendship in a way, I don't know. I felt . empty a lot of the time. I was looking to fill a void. I was a child, a . vulnerable child.’ Evidence: The now 21-year-old woman says the gang abused her from the age of 12, demanding sexual favours and eventually selling her on to other men around Oxford . The woman said she probably looked 15 when she met the defendants, as she was tall for her age, but added the men knew her real age. She contacted police in September 2006 after claiming she was abused by one of the defendants - Akhtar Dogar - and another man when she was 15. A video recording of her interview with police at the time of her report, was played to the jury. During the interview, Girl A said: ‘I just hate myself. I just feel proper dirty and disgusted with myself. ‘I don't want them to have any hold over me. They can't control my life anymore.’ ‘They're doing it to other girls. Little girls with their school uniforms on.’ Four more girls are still to evidence including one who was allegedly forced to have a back street abortion after one of the men got her pregnant. Kamar Jamil, 27, Akhtar Dogar, 32, his brother Anjum Dogar, 30, Assad Hussain, 32, Mohammed Karrar, Bassam Karrar, Mohammed Hussain, 24, Zeeshan Ahmed, 27, and Bilal Ahmed, 26, deny all the charges against them.

"Eating instant noodles two or three times a week increased the risk of heart disease and stroke . From a cheap student staple to a pricey bowl of broth, noodle dishes are soaring in popularity. But they could also wreak havoc with your health, a new study warns. U.S. scientists found people who ate noodle dishes two to three times a week - including the Japanese noodle soup dish ramen - had an increased risk of developing cardiometabolic syndrome. This, in turn, raises a person’s likelihood of developing heart disease . and other conditions, such as diabetes and stroke. The findings, published in The Journal of Nutrition, could shed new light on the risks of a worldwide dietary habit, said lead study author Hyun Joon Shin. Dr Shin, who led the study on behalf of . the Baylor Heart and Vascular Hospital, in Texas, said instant noodles and ramen appeared to be particularly damaging to women's health. Because ramen consumption is relatively high among Asian populations, the research focused primarily on South Korea, which has the highest instant noodle consumption person in the world. In recent years, South Koreans have experienced a rapid increase in health problems, specifically heart disease, and a growing number of overweight adults, said Dr Shin. He decided to investigate the connection between noodle consumption and poor health. Noodles, like many processed foods, are high in salt - and a diet high in the mineral can increase the risk of heart disease and stroke. And earlier this year, Braden Kuo, a gastrointestinal specialist from the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston found the body struggles to digest dried, ramen noodles. He used a tiny camera to look at the digestive activity of instant ramen noodles in comparison to the digestion of fresh ones. Many instant . ramen noodles, he said, contain the chemical Tertiary-butyl hydroquinone . (TBHQ), a food additive that is a bi-product of butane, used in the . petroleum industry. After the experiment, he said: 'The most striking thing about our experiment when you looked at a time . interval, say in one or two hours, [was that] processed ramen noodles . were less broken down than homemade ramen noodles.' The findings even apply to the Japanese noodle soup dish ramen - with women most at risk of health problems . In the new study, Dr Shin found women in particular were more likely to suffer health problems from slurping bowls of noodles. This, he says, can be attributed to biological differences - such as sex hormones and metabolism -  between men and women. Ramen is a Japanese . noodle soup dish. It consists of Chinese-style wheat noodles served in a . meat- or fish-based broth, often flavoured with soy sauce or miso, and . uses toppings such as sliced pork, dried seaweed, kamaboko, and green . onions. However it may be because women are more likely to accurately report what they ate each day, he adds.Another potential factor in the gender differences is a chemical called bisphenol A (BPA) - used to package noodles in Styrofoam containers. Studies have shown that BPA interferes with the way hormones send messages through the body, specifically oestrogen, said Dr Shin. 'This research is significant since many people are consuming instant noodles without knowing possible health risks,' he added. 'My hope is that this study can lay a foundation for future research about the health effects of instant noodle consumption.'","Noodle dishes increased .

"Extremely rare handcuffs, truncheon and whistle carried by a police officer who found Jack the Ripper's fourth victim are to be auctioned. The unusual items, along with a notebook cover, were carried by PC Edward Watkins when he discovered the mutilated body of Catherine Eddowes. Jack the Ripper was blamed for a string of murders during a three-month period in 1888, when five women were killed on the streets of London's Whitechapel. Under the hammer: The handcuffs, truncheon, whistle and note book cover belonging to PC Edward Watkins are expected to fetch between £500 and £800 each . PC Watkins discovered the body of Catherine Eddowes (pictured left), who was Jack the Ripper's fourth victim in Mitre Square. Elizabeth Stride (right) was killed a few hours later . All the women murdered by Jack the Ripper between August and November 1888 were prostitutes. The body of Mary Nichols was found at around 3.40am on August 31 1888, in a gateway in Buck's Row, Whitechapel. She is generally believed to have been the first of Jack the Ripper's so-called 'canonical' five victims. She had been disemboweled. The mutilated corpse of Annie Chapman was found in the backyard of number 29 Hanbury Street at 6am. The killer, who struck on September 8 1888, had made off with her womb. Elizabeth Stride was found dead on September 30 1888, at 1am in Dutfield's Yard, off Berner Street. It is believed the ripper may have been interrupted as her throat had been cut, but the rest of her body was untouched. The body of Catherine Eddowes, was found in Mitre Square in the City of London at 1.45am on September 30 1888. Her uterus and kidney were removed and her cheeks torn. . Many experts believe Mary Kelly was Jack the Ripper's finals victim. She was found in her room in Miller's Court, off Dorset Street at 10.45am on November 9 1888. Their throats were slashed and bodies mutilated but no one was ever caught and 'the Ripper's' identity remains one of the world's greatest crime mysteries. PC Watkins, who started his patrols of Mitre Street, London, on Saturday September 29 1888 around 10pm, discovered the Ms Eddowes corpse around 1.44am. Catherine, who was discovered in the south-west corner of Mitre Square, was the Ripper's fourth horrific killing. The notorious serial killer also murdered Mary Ann Nichols, Annie Chapman, Elizabeth Stride and Mary Jane Kelly in London's East End. Earlier this month criminologist Dr Gareth Norris from Aberystwyth University claimed that Jack the Ripper was meat cart driver, Charles Allen Lechmere. He believes that his legitimately blood-spattered appearance helped him to evade justice. Lechmere was found leaning over victim Mary Ann Nichols' body on Buck's Row in Whitechapel on August 31, 1888 and told police he had only been there a few minutes. He also passed Hanbury Street, Dorset Street and Mitre Square at roughly the same times as the Ripper killings - while another happened in Berners Street, where his mother lived. It is a theory that joins many others in relation to the murders. In the years that have passed since the killing spree, many high-profile suspects have been suggested including Prince Albert Victor, the grandson of Queen Victoria and Sir William Gull, the Queen's doctor. All four lots belonging to PC Watkins are to be sold separately and are expected to fetch between £500 and £800 each. A criminologist has claimed Jack the Ripper could be a meat cart driver from Whitechapel and his blood-splattered appearance may have been what helped him evade justice . The leather notebook City of London Police notebook cover is stamped with Watkin's number, '881City'. The items have come from a private collector who has had them in family possession for over three generations. The vendor's grandfather purchased the items directly from the Watkins family and this is the first time these items have been offered for sale. Auctioneer Jonathan Humbert said: 'It's chilling to think these very items may have physically been only yards from Jack the Ripper and played such an integral role in one of the most fascinating unresolved crimes of all time. 'Ripper items are rarer than rare and I have no doubt these items will really capture the public's imagination around the world. 'The fact that the items have provenance, are of the correct age and have been privately owned for so long really helps to give them added value.' The auction takes place on Wednesday December 10 at JP Humbert Auctioneers in Towcester, Northants.

"A pet owner who bought a tortoise on Gumtree for £100 was stunned when it arrived duct-taped to the inside of a cereal box. The animal was reportedly left dazed and confused after a horror journey lasting around 18 hours from London to Wormit, Fife - 500 miles away. The buyer said he was shocked at the 'inhumane' treatment and had paid extra money for a polystyrene box with  straw bedding. I would walk 500 miles: A tortoise was sent from London to Fife - duct-taped to a cereal box (pictured) Instead, he received a purple Choco Hoops box with the pet stuffed inside. The man, who asked to remain anonymous, told Dundee's Evening Telegraph he already owned one tortoise and had bought a new one to keep his pet company. He also owns dogs and cats, and used to keep iguanas. He told the Evening Telegraph: 'There was duct tape all over him and he couldn't move. Everyone knows tortoises are slow, but they need exercise when in transit. 'He was very cold when he arrived, and, to be honest, I thought he was dead.' The man added the tortoise he received was not even the one in the photo. The man said of his new pet: 'He was very cold when he arrived, and, to be honest, I thought he was dead' 'Looking back, the seller should've been able to answer more questions than he did,' he admitted. Government regulations say all animals must be transported 'in a way that does not or is not likely to cause injury or undue suffering to them.' The rules add: 'Transport, handling, loading and unloading may be stressful to some animals as a result of unaccustomed and unfamiliar surroundings. 'It is important, therefore, that everyone involved in these operations is aware of the correct action to take to minimise adverse effects in handling and transport and of the effects on the animals if these procedures are not followed properly.' The buyer has been urged to pass details of the incident to the Scottish Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Tortoise owners are advised to used a box slightly bigger than the animal, with enough space for it to stretch its legs but not to move freely around. The container should have air holes and not be transparent, because tortoises can get stressed if they see the world moving at high speed around them. There should be straw bedding into which the tortoise can burrow a little and hide in the dark. This will encourage the animal to sleep through the journey without noticing the time going by. It is also more comfortable and also helps absorb shocks or knocks. Any box should be secured tightly in the boot of a car or if it is being posted, it must have live animal stickers by law and be sent with a specialist courier or delivery firm. Tortoises can urinate into their bedding during the journey, so they should be bathed and brought into fresh surroundings as soon as possible afterwards.

"A jealous engineer strangled his wannabe glamour model girlfriend during a sunshine holiday and dumped her naked body in the sea before flying back to Britain alone, a court heard yesterday. Christopher Chittock throttled pretty blonde Sarah Shields with his bare hands on a deserted Gran Canaria beach after flying into a rage when he discovered texts to an ex-boyfriend on her phone, the court was told. He burned her belongings but flew back to their home in Ipswich, Suffolk, with her mobile and messaged her friends and family pretending to be Miss Shields and claiming she had stayed in Spain with a new lover, prosecutors said. Throttled: Sarah Shields (right) was beaten and strangled by her jealous boyfriend Christopher Chittock (left) on holidays before he flew back to Britain alone, the court heard . Divorced father-of-one Chittock, 38, was arrested when Spanish police identified her body three days after returning to the UK. State prosecutor Beatriz Sanchez claimed Chittock killed the 23-year-old Katie Price fan on July 6 2010 after discovering a text to ex-boyfriend William Newham saying: 'I wish you could be here with me.' She told the jury of four men and five women set to decide the Brit’s fate: 'He hit her several times in the apartment shouting she was a whore. 'Then he took her to a dark, deserted beach opposite their holiday complex and with the aim of ending her life, punched her repeatedly in the face until she fell to the ground, causing her injuries including a broken nose. 'After, he sat on top of her and began to smash her head on the stones on the beach. 'While she was still alive but weakened and stunned and swallowing blood because of her broken nose, he took advantage of her defencelessness and began to strangle her with his bare hands until she stopped breathing and died.' Sarah’s naked body was pulled out of the Atlantic Ocean near the couple’s holiday apartment in the popular resort of Mogan early on July 7 2010. Chittock, who met the gas firm employee through work, flew back home three days later after allegedly burning a suitcase with all her personal belongings except her phone on a bonfire. He was extradited to Spain in September 2010 and charged with her murder. State prosecutors accused him yesterday at the Las Palmas Provincial Court of sending a series of incriminating text messages to her friends and family from her mobile after she was found dead to try to cover up his crime. One, sent to her mother Angela as Miss Shields’s unidentified body was lying in a morgue, claimed she planned to stay on Gran Canaria with a new boyfriend and said: 'I’m going to miss my dog.' Another was a text to best friend Sarah Clark, who had asked her to buy cheap cigarettes, was sent two days after Sarah was found floating in the sea, advising her when to pick them up from her at work. Telling the court Miss Shields and . Chittock’s mobile phones had been tracked using satellite technology, . she added: 'How is it possible that your and her phones are located in . the same place at the same time when you get off the plane at Stansted . Airport and they are still located together when you return to the home . you shared with Sarah in Ipswich?' 'I'm going to miss my dog': Chittock burned Miss Shields's belongings but kept her phone to message her friends and family pretending she was alive . Chittock, dressed in blue jeans and a black top, spoke in a whispered voice through an interpreter. He claimed his girlfriend, who dreamed of becoming a lingerie model, walked out on him two days before she was found dead for a mystery man called Jason she had met at their holiday complex the week before. He admitted to shutting her out of their apartment after 'spotting them kissing' but insisted: 'I raised my voice to her because I was obviously upset but not my hand. 'I was obviously very upset but there’s a big difference between being upset and killing someone.' He added: 'I ended things with her because I could see she didn’t want to be with me. 'I went for a walk and when I came back she had collected her belongings and had gone. That was the last time I saw her. 'I never sent any messages from her phone because I didn’t have it.' Chittock choked back tears as he spoke of his broken marriage to ex-wife Catharine, mother of their nine-year-old son, who he left for Miss Shields. She sat yards from him in the front row of the public gallery after flying to Gran Canaria to hear his evidence. The trial, scheduled to last three days, continues.

"Hospital waiting lists have soared to a five-year high, with almost 2.9million patients in the queue for treatment. New figures show that at the end of June the number of people waiting to start NHS treatment after being referred by their GP was 240,000 higher than the same time last year. It comes as the respected medical journal The Lancet accused ministers of treating the health service like a ‘failing bank’ by trying to bail-out crisis hit units with extra money instead of taking responsibility for care. Delays: At the end of June 2.88 million people were waiting for hospital treatment, the highest number since May 2008 . The government has been stung by accusations that the NHS is struggling to cope with increased demand. Last winter A&E departments were likened to war zones with huge increases in people turning up at casualty departments because many GPs will not work out of hours and the new NHS 111 helpline went into meltdown. Now data shows the number of people waiting for operations and other hospital treatment has hit 2,876,836. It is the highest level since a figure of 2,871,949 was record in May 2008. Shadow health minister Andrew Gwynne said: ‘This year, thousands of extra patients are facing the agony of a long-awaited operation being cancelled as overflowing A&E departments need more and more hospital beds. ‘Whole hospitals are being consumed by the crisis in A&E. David Cameron wasted £3 billion on an NHS reorganisation that took the focus off patient care. ‘At the same time, almost 5,000 nursing jobs were axed and cuts to older people's care budgets left thousands more vulnerable people arriving at A&E. This is further proof you can't trust the Tories with the NHS.’ The NHS regulator Monitor has raised concerns that non-urgent operations are being called in some hospitals ‘to deal with increased A&E and non-elective pressures’. Last week Mr Cameron announced a £500million fund for over-crowded A&Es to help ease the pressure on the NHS. Operation: The Department for Health insists most people are still treated within 18 weeks despite rising numbers of patients on waiting lists . The Prime Minister said the emergency fund money should be used to help hospitals and social workers to ensure that the elderly no longer block beds in hospitals at weekends and at night because there are no home helps to help them leave. But The Lancet claimed the move was evidence of ministers leaving staff to shoulder the blame for problems in services. In a damning editorial, it said: 'One might be forgiven for thinking that the current Coalition Government views the NHS as a failing bank or business. 'This stance is one of the most cynical, and at the same time cunning, ways by which the government abdicates all responsibilities for running a health care system that has patient care and safety at its heart.' However, the Department of Health insisted that despite the sharp increase in the number of people on waiting lists, targets were still being met. Of those people who needed admitting to hospital for treatment, 91.7 per cent were seen within 18 weeks, the latest figures show. The national target is for 90 per cent of admitted patients to be seen within this timeframe. Of those who did not need admitting, 97.4 per cent were seen within 18 weeks, against a target of 95 per cent. Cash: Prime Minister David Cameron last week used a visit to Salford Royal Hospital to announce £500million had been found for stretched A&Es . A spokesman for the Department of Health said: ‘The NHS is performing well - it is treating over a million patients a month. ‘But despite this, average waiting times are low and stable and the number of patients waiting longer than 18 weeks is nearly 55,000 lower than in May 2010. ‘The number of people waiting for more than a year to start treatment is the lowest it has ever been. ‘A&E departments have been seeing 95 per cent of their patients within four hours since the end of April.’ According to the Government, the NHS is now handling 4.3 million more outpatient appointments every year compared to 2009-10. There are 590,000 more planned procedures in hospitals every year and 2.4 million more diagnostic tests are being carried out.","At the end of June 2.88million were on waiting lists, highest since May 2008 .

"Internet troll: Reece Elliott has been jailed for more than two years after admitting making threats to kill and eight Communications Act offences . An internet troll whose 'grossly offensive' Facebook postings included threats to kill 200 US children has been jailed for more than two years after a judge heard how he spread terror in local schools. Reece Elliott, 24, left abusive comments on tribute pages set up for two teenagers who died in car accidents. But when he was challenged he sent more nasty messages directly to pupils living in Warren County, Tennessee, in February. After a deputy sheriff contacted him to say he would shut the page down, curly-haired Elliott sparked a security crackdown at local schools by threatening to shoot 200 children. With sensitivities heightened in the US following the Newtown shooting which saw 20 children and six adults killed in an elementary school, hundreds saw Elliott's message and almost 3,000 pupils missed classes the next day, Newcastle Crown Court heard. Tennessee police began investigating, along with the FBI and Homeland Security. Elliott, from South Shields, South Tyneside, contacted his solicitor and walked into his local police station to admit what he had done when he realised the outcry he had caused. At a previous hearing he admitted one count of making threats to kill and eight Communications Act offences. Prosecutor Bridie Smurthwaite said Elliott left 'grossly offensive' messages to two tribute sites. On one for a teenage girl killed by a drink driver, he wrote: 'F****** fat c*** deserves to die.' And on another for a teenager who died in a car crash, he said: 'Hip, hip, horray, he is dead motherf******. Huge brain injuries. Stupid motherf****** b****. I hope you rot in hell.' When Elliott's fake Facebook profile received a friend request from a local deputy sheriff, the officer was branded a 'paedo'. Outcry: Elliott (left) contacted his solicitor and walked into his local police station to admit what he had done when he realised the outcry he had caused. Pictured (right) is Elliott's home in South Shields (the door on the right) After the lawman said he would shut down Elliott's page, the father-of-one went online again, with severe consequences for him. He wrote on the teenage girl's tribute page: 'My father has three guns. I'm planning on killing him first and putting his body in the dumpster. 'Then I'm taking the motor and I'm going in fast. 'I'm gonna kill hopefully at least 200 before I kill myself. So you want to tell the deputy, I'm on my way.' Because it was posted on the site's public wall, many hundreds of people probably saw it, the court heard. School officials were swamped with calls . and texts from concerned staff, parents and pupils so security was . stepped up, with only restricted access to sites. Threats: Elliott sparked a security crackdown at local schools by threatening to shoot 200 children . Nevertheless, 2,908 out of 6,654 pupils, or 44 per cent of the register, missed classes at schools in the county the next day. One girl, now 16 and whose identity cannot be reported, received a private message from Elliott which said: 'You have been chosen tomorrow at school to receive one of my bullets.' She replied: 'Screw off dude.' 'During the first week in February this . year, with what seems to be no more than self-indulgent nastiness, you . posted a series of grossly offensive comments on Facebook' - Judge James Goss QC . Elliott said: 'The doctors will have to unscrew the bullet from your skull b****.' The girl then offered to pray for her abuser, saying: 'Wow, you need serious help.' She told police afterwards: 'I think it should be taken very seriously, even though he was miles and miles away in another country, I was still scared and I didn't want to come to school even after they caught him.' After his arrest, Elliott said he was an internet troll, the purpose of which was to provoke arguments and reaction. Miss Smurthwaite said he told officers 'it was a massive mistake'. Elliott has 17 convictions for 28 offences, including at the age of 16 an attempted robbery on a bookmakers when he was armed with an axe, and a racially aggravated public order offence in a pizza shop. John Wilkinson, defending said Elliott was described by a psychiatrist as emotionally immature and impulsive. Hearing: Newcastle Crown Court heard how after his arrest Elliott said he was an internet troll, the purpose of which was to provoke arguments and reaction . 'As he says himself ""It's time I finally grew up and started to act like an adult"",' Mr Wilkinson told the court. Mr Wilkinson said Elliott could not explain his behaviour, which the defendant said was 'idiotic, childish and pathetic'. Elliott bowed his head and wept as Judge James Goss QC, the Recorder of Newcastle, passed a two years and four month sentence. 'Investigating reports of criminal . behaviour on social network sites has its challenges but we have staff . who are trained in navigating these systems and identifying who the . offenders are' - Detective Chief Inspector Ged Noble . He told Elliott: 'During the first week in February this year, with what seems to be no more than self-indulgent nastiness, you posted a series of grossly offensive comments on Facebook.' Outside court, Detective Chief Inspector Ged Noble, who led the investigation, said officers were about to arrest Elliott when he walked into the police station. The FBI contacted colleagues in England after discovering that the threats were coming from the North East. He said: 'Police officers were about to go to the identified address when we were notified by a local solicitor that Reece Elliott wanted to hand himself in.' Mr Noble continued: 'Investigating reports of criminal behaviour on social network sites has its challenges but we have staff who are trained in navigating these systems and identifying who the offenders are. 'New guidelines on dealing with people who post offensive messages using social media have been released by the Director of Public Prosecutions and we will continue to work closely with the Crown Prosecution Service to take action against those who cross the line from their right to free speech to committing criminal offences.'

"'Menacing': Romanian pimp Marcel Vasile, 36, has been brought to justice five years on following an international manhunt . A Romanian pimp who ‘bought’ a woman from sex traffickers and then forced her into prostitution has been jailed for 15 years. Marcel Vasile, 36, has been convicted five years after she was sold by father-and-son duo Bogdan and Marius Nejloveanus following an international manhunt. Vasile, described as a 'calculating, menacing character' with little regard for women, raped his 23-year-old victim and made her work in massage parlours. He was jailed after being found guilty of rape, controlling prostitution and trafficking. The woman was one of six brought to Britain by the Nejloveanus, who are also from Romania. In early 2008, she was sold to Vasile, a London-based pimp who was on the run from a sex trafficking case in Spain, because she was fighting the Nejloveanus' attempts to exploit her. The Nejloveanus then went on to supply other women to massage parlours in Manchester. They used the example of the victim they had ‘sold’ to scare the other trafficked women. Father and son were jailed in 2011, but Vasile remained at large until last year, when Manchester detectives brought him back from Spain to face charges of rape, controlling prostitution and trafficking within the UK. Vasile, of no fixed address, had denied the offences, but was found guilty following a trial at Manchester Crown Court. Passing sentence, Judge Robert Atherton told him: 'You demonstrated little regard not only for her, but for women in general.' The capture of Vasile brings to an end a long-running Greater Manchester Police investigation which began in October 2008, when police learned the Nejloveanus had been supplying trafficked women to massage parlours in the city. Their victims told police of a sixth woman who had been sold to Marcel Vasile, who was identified only as a 'gypsy in London' at the time. By then the woman had escaped from Vasile and returned to Romania after running away from the massage parlour in London where he had forced her to work. She had told police in the capital of her ordeal, but they let Vasile go without charge after she was too scared to press charges. After learning of this, the Manchester detectives decided to hunt him down. 'Menacing': Vasile was jailed for 15 years after being convicted of rape, trafficking and controlling prostitution following a trial at Manchester Crown Court . Using his fingerprint they managed to get his real name from the authorities in his native Romania, who confirmed he had been extradited to Spain. In December last year Vasile was brought back from Spain, where he was serving time for other trafficking offences, using a European arrest warrant. The court heard he was first convicted of sex trafficking in Romania in 1996. Detective Constable Colin Ward said: 'Vasile is a calculating, menacing character who has shown not an ounce of remorse.'","Marcel Vasile, 36, raped victim and forced her to work in massage parlours .

"Mexican cartels who have murdered thousands are infiltrating Australia to peddle drugs for maximum profit. Australian Crime Commission chief executive Chris Dawson says the cartels can get higher prices for their drugs in Australia than in Mexico or the US. 'Organised crime is motivated principally by profit and criminals look to exploit markets which offer high returns for low or calculated risk,' he said in a statement on Monday. 'Recently, we've seen the emergence of Mexican cartel activity within Australia. Mexican drug cartels are targeting Australia, motivated by higher profits. Pictured: police guard more than seven tons of cocaine belonging to a Mexican cartel and bound for Belgium and Spain at an airport in Lima . 'You only need to look to the violence on the streets in Mexico and the thousands of people who have died at the hands of Mexican drug cartels to realise how dangerous these groups are, and they are now looking at Australia as a destination to facilitate their crime.' A kilogram of cocaine is worth about $A13,500 in Mexico and about $A35,000 in the US. But if it reaches Australian shores it could fetch about $A250,000. 'While there are additional costs involved in importing cocaine to Australia, this represents a significant mark-up,' Mr Dawson said. 'It's a fact the profits of Mexican drug cartels alone rival the GDP of some of the world's smaller nations.' Mr Dawson said the cartels had links to Australian outlaw motorcycle gangs and organised crime groups. A kilogram of cocaine is worth about $A13,500 in Mexico, $A35,000 in the US and $A250,000 in Australia. Pictured:  Mexican police guard two tons of seized marijuana in Chihuahua State in Mexico on February 6 . Two Mexican men allegedly linked to a cartel were arrested in Sydney in July. The ACC and Australian Federal Police (AFP) said at the time they seized about 30kg of suspected crystal methamphetamine with a street value of up to $30 million, guns and about $2 million. Mr Dawson said the commission and other law enforcement agencies were sharing intelligence with the US and other overseas authorities in a bid to choke the syndicates. AFP liaison officers based in the US are also engaging with Mexican authorities. 'The AFP also works closely with North American law enforcement liaison officers based Australia,' an AFP spokesperson said. Two Mexican men allegedly linked to a cartel were arrested in Sydney in July. Pictured: Lima police carry 25kg packages of  cocaine that was seized from a Mexican cartel . Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Ken Lay said the insidious reach of global drug crime was part of the changing face of policing, combining the efforts of state, national and international authorities. 'No longer are crimes being committed in geographical areas,' he told reporters on Monday. 'These are very, very violent people, with a history of murder and assault and robbery and peddling poison to our communities. 'This is a challenge that we're going to have to stand up and face.'","A kilogram of cocaine is worth about $A13,500 in Mexico, $A35,000 in the US and $A250,000 in Australia .

"The last time they were side by side was as babies in their mother’s arms. But 78 years later, after being separated before they were 20 weeks old, long lost twin sisters named Ann and Elizabeth have finally been reunited. They spent lifetimes apart in different countries; one never knew she had a sister, the other never knew where her adopted twin might be. Elizabeth Hammel sets eyes on her twin sister Ann Hunt for he first time in 78 yeras after they were separated . As soon as the sisters saw each other they hugged, shedding tears of joy after finally being reunited . This week they met for the first time – to discover striking parallels in the separate paths they followed. After hugging and shedding tears of joy, they caught up on old times in their first face-to-face conversation. Their time apart is said to be the longest that twins have been separated, an unwitting achievement that will give experts extra insight into a fascinating phenomenon. Despite growing up apart, carving out lives in different cultures and being separated by 5,000 miles, both married someone called Jim, found religion, became grandmothers, then widows. When they opened the family albums for each other they also discovered that each enjoys goofing about in front of the camera. When they’re together, they share some of the same mannerisms. Elizabeth, left and Ann, right both said 'how lovely' as they reached out to one another . Despite growing up apart both married someone called Jim, found religion, became grandmothers, then widows . They even chose the same words as they approached each other for the first time with arms outstretched: ‘How lovely!’ they said, almost in unison. The poignant story began when the sisters were born Elizabeth Ann Lamb and Patricia Susan Lamb on February 28, 1936, in Hampshire. Their father was stationed at Aldershot barracks and had a fling with Alice Lamb, a domestic servant for a well-to-do family nearby. He never saw his daughters. Alice, who would almost certainly have been stigmatised for having children out of wedlock, and would probably have had to abandon her job to bring up two babies simultaneously, was forced to offer them for adoption. Patricia was raised by Hector and Gladys Wilson, a local family, who named her Ann. Elizaeth, left, was raised by her biological mother Alice but Ann, right was brougt up by adoptive parents Hector and Gladys Wilson . But Elizabeth had curvature of the spine and was deemed unsuitable for adoption. So Alice kept her and called on friends and an aunt to help raise her. She was 15 before her mother told her she had a twin who was adopted, but she didn’t try to trace her sibling while her mother was alive. And when Alice died in 1980, the adoption papers and other records had been lost. Elizabeth moved to Chester, joined the Royal Navy and married an American sailor. The couple settled in Portland, Oregon, and raised two boys there. Coincidentally, Ann discovered her past at almost the same time as Elizabeth. Her aunt told her the Wilsons were not her natural parents and she immediately went home to ask her stepmother. She cannot explain it now, but the way she phrased the question might have been significant. Although she never knew she was a twin, she asked: ‘Were we adopted?’ She was happy to remain in Aldershot for the rest of her life, marrying, becoming a printer and raising three daughters. It was her daughter Samantha, 43, who discovered during some family tree research that mum appeared to have a sister. She traced her to America and after much research and several setbacks was able to tell her mother: ‘She’s your twin!’ They both married men called Jim, with Elizabeth, left on her wedding day with her American sailor husband and Ann, right on hers . An overjoyed Ann wrote to Elizabeth at the address Samantha had unearthed. Elizabeth described the moment she saw the Aldershot postmark and read the letter. ‘My eyes popped out of my head,’ she said. ‘I couldn’t get on the phone fast enough to give her a call. ‘I had tried to trace her over the years but it seemed an impossible task. I had no idea where in the world she might be or even whether she was still alive.’ Both women found out they had more in common than they thought. This is despite Elizabeth, left, and Ann, right living on opposite sides of the Atlantic . At the other end of the phone, Ann recalls: ‘I was so excited I could hardly speak. I’m so happy. I feel now I’ve known her all my life.’ They finally met in person on Thursday near Los Angeles and quickly began to pore over photos in search of similarities. They do not believe they are identical twins but researchers will establish this through DNA testing, before conducting extensive interviews with them. The research, by the Minnesota Study of Twins Reared Apart, will be used to look into ways of combating inherited disease and learning about the ageing process. Meanwhile Elizabeth (she boasts she’s 20 minutes older than her little sister) was amazed that Ann had never left Aldershot. So yesterday she was organising a reunion party back home in Oregon – with her new-found sister as the star guest.","Ann Hunt and Elizabeth Hemmel were separated at 20 weeks old .

"When little Leighton's tummy began to swell two weeks ago, her parents took her to the doctor thinking she had nothing more than wind. But an X-ray revealed the cause of the newborn's distended tummy was a cancerous tumor which grew to the size of a three-pound cantaloupe within weeks. After a 12-hour operation to remove the . lump and most of her digestive system, the frail eight-week-old baby will need multiple organ transplants and reconstructive surgery to stay alive. Her heartbroken parents Keenan and Dave Sanders remain at her bedside at Seattle Children's Hospital in Washington, hoping their precious second child will continue to gain weight and get stronger. 'When I start to take everything in at once, I can't handle it. I can't listen to it,' mother Keenan Sanders told KOMO News. 'It becomes too much when I hear every single obstacle that she faces and will face. It's overwhelming.' Heartbreaking: Little Leighton Sanders is fighting for her life after a massive tumor the size of a cantaloupe was removed from her belly . Hopeful: Washington couple Keenan and Dave Sanders remain at their baby daughter Leighton's bedside hoping she will continue to gain weight and get stronger (family pictured) KOMO News reported Keenan Sanders, a mother-of-two, took her daughter to the doctor several weeks ago when she first noticed something was wrong. Doctors planned to . wait a few weeks to remove the tumor, but they brought forward the surgery when it expanded from the size of a softball to the size of a . cantaloupe in weeks. When the huge bulge was removed, Leighton's weight dropped from eight-and-a-half pounds to five-and-a-half pounds. Surgeons also removed her gallbladder, intestine, and parts of her stomach and pancreas, which had been damaged by the tumor. In good news, doctors said the tumor was only five per cent cancerous and are waiting to see if cancer has spread to Leighton's body. 'I had forgotten we had come [to the . hospital] for cancer in the first place. That became the . best case scenario, that it’s just cancer,' Keenan Sanders said. 'As long as I have a piece of hope, there’s something I can hang on to. There were a couple days where it seemed her best case scenario was so dismal. It was just crushing.' Surgery: After a 12-hour operation to remove the tumor, Leighton Sander's weight dropped from eight-and-a-half pounds to five-and-a-half-pounds . Hope: Doctors said it is unlikely cancer has spread through little Leighton's body (pictured left and right) While doctors say the little girl's cancer is most likely under control, her road to recovery is far from over. She will need to undergo further surgeries to close up her original surgical wound and to create a . drainage system, in addition to multiple organ transplants. 'It seems miraculous to me that they can essentially build a human. That’s the end result we’re hoping for,' Keenan Sanders told ABC News.

"'I am really angry': Baroness Warsi spoke out amid a growing furore at Westminster about the amount of coverage given to Anjem Choudary . TV stations should not give airtime to preachers of hate who are ‘idiots and nutters’, a leading minister said last night. Baroness Warsi spoke out amid a growing furore at Westminster about the amount of coverage given to Anjem Choudary and other militant Islamists on the BBC, ITV and Channel 4 News. The BBC in particular – who have released footage of  Michael Adebolajo standing behind Choudary at a 2007 demonstration – came under fire for offering the hate-filled radical a slot on last night’s Newsnight programme on BBC2. The decision was branded ‘idiotic’, ‘irresponsible’ and ‘insensitive’. Baroness Warsi said: ‘We all have a responsibility, including the media, not to give airtime to extremist voices – idiots and nutters who speak for no one but themselves. ‘The heartening thing in the midst of all this tragedy is that the British Muslim community has, with a unified, unreserved voice, condemned the killing and pledged support for our armed forces. ‘This is a real maturing of the community which has taken years of painstaking work and frank discussions behind closed doors. 'This time everyone has stepped up to the mark. Yet here broadcasters are undoing all this by giving a platform to one appalling man who represents nobody. I am really angry.’ Choudary, former head of banned Islamist organisation Al Muhajiroun, was behind the planned protest march in 2010 through Royal Wootton Bassett, the town where dead British soldiers were repatriated. He has been accused of radicalising Adebolajo – the blood-soaked man who was filmed in the aftermath of the horrific attack berating the British government – in the mid-2000s. Hate preacher: The BBC released footage of Michael Adebolajo standing behind Anjem Choudary in 2007 . Defence Secretary Jim Murphy said on Twitter: ‘Banned from France but welcome on Newsnight. A mistake of the BBC to invite Anjem Choudary onto the telly tonight.’ Sadiq Khan, Labour’s Shadow Justice Secretary, also condemned the BBC’s decision, telling LBC radio that the radical was an ‘offensive and obnoxious media tart’ with no followers. Choudary also appeared on the BBC’s rolling news channel and has been on ITV News. Yesterday it also emerged that Choudary and another radical Islamist, who both knew one of the alleged Woolwich terrorists, had separately been given a platform to air their own militant views by Channel 4. Both Abu Nusaybah and Choudary admitted they knew ‘Mujaahid’ – who has been identified as Adebolajo. The pair were given their own slot on the broadcaster’s 4thought.tv, a two-minute opinion show that airs immediately after its nightly news bulletin. On Newsnight: Kirsty Walk (c) interviewed Choudary (l) last night with the Ebrahim College Imam and director Shams Adduha Muhammad (r) and and the Islamic Society of Britain executive director Julie Siddiqui (cr) Another appearance: Anjem Choudary (r) was also interviewed on Channel 4 News last night at 7pm . The decision by the broadcaster to hand over its airwaves to both men had sparked anger from moderate Muslims. Two men were arrested yesterday for allegedly sending racist tweets about the murder of the soldier in Woolwich. Police . in Bristol detained the pair after complaints about anti-religious . messages which appeared on Twitter within hours of the killing. Officers say a man aged 23  and another aged 22 were yesterday arrested on suspicion of inciting racial or religious hatred. Both men had been previously given slots on the channel in 2010 to talk about sharia law. According to Channel 4’s website, Nusaybah told the programme that Britain would be a safer place if it adhered to sharia law. A BBC spokesman said it would not comment on guests for its programme. A Channel 4 spokesman said: ‘4thought.tv includes contributions from a broad spectrum of religions and beliefs and of those Muslims featuring on the slot the vast majority would describe themselves as moderate.’ Humza Yusaf, the Scottish Government’s minister for external affairs, tweeted: ‘I really hope media are sensible and do not give the horrendous Anjem Choudary  a minute of publicity to promote his vile hatred.’","Much coverage given to Anjem Choudary and other militant Islamists .

"A radical Muslim cleric has claimed 'God destined' for British solider Lee Rigby to die in the barbaric terror attack on the streets of Woolwich. Omar Bakri Mohammed, who is banned from Britain, has given interviews in Lebanon applauding the 'heroes' who slaughtered the 25-year-old in an apparently unprovoked attack on Wednesday. It comes as the police are urged to monitor closely comments by leading radical clerics in the UK to see if they have broken the law in the days since the attack. Muslim cleric Omar Bakri Mohammed has said he understands why the suspects would have carried out the attacks and even called suspect Michael Adebolajo (left) a ‘hero’ Islamist preacher Omar Bakri praised Michael Adebolajo for remaining at the murder scene . The BBC, ITV and Channel 4 have been condemned for giving airtime to Anjem Choudary and other militant Islamists this week. Critics say the radical preachers in Britain are carefully 'flying close to the wind' by appearing to support the Woolwich killing without breaking laws on inciting religious hatred. But Bakri Mohammed, speaking from abroad, has gone much further. In an interview with The Independent, he said he understood why the suspects would have carried out the barbaric . attack on Drummer Lee Rigby. He said: ‘I saw the film and we could see that he (the suspect) was being very courageous. ‘Under Islam this can be justified, he . was not targeting civilians, he was taking on a military man in an . operation. To people around here (in the Middle East) he is a hero.’ Bakri Mohammed, who developed the extremist group Hizb ut-Tahrir in the UK before founding Al-Muhajiroun, has even said he knew Adebolajo personally and converted him to Islam. The cleric is said to have close links to al-Qaeda and  once known as the Tottenham Ayatollah for his radical sermons before leaving London shortly after the 2005 bombings. He now lives in exile in Lebanon after being told by the Home Office that he would not be allowed to return to the UK. He claimed that he once owned a stall in London which Adebolajo would visit. The pair would talk about the ‘meaning of life’ and Adebolajo began attending open talks and meetings. In a separate interview with Reuters today, he added: I think Michael, or Mujahid, is going to stand for what God has destined for him. 'God destined for him to carry out the attack and God destined for the British soldier to die for the cause he believed in.' He added that while Muslims in Britain condemned the attack, Muslims in Lebanon are 'proud' of it. Tears: A man puts down flowers at the scene where Lee Rigby died in Woolwich . Victim: Lee Rigby, 25, was yesterday named as the victim of the Woolwich knife attack . Questions: Police and security services have faced criticism over what they knew about the suspected killers of Drummer Lee Rigby . Meanwhile the decision to give Choudary airtime has attracted fierce criticism. On BBC Newsnight he was challenged over video footage showing Michael Adebolajo, one of Drummer Rigby's suspected killers, attempting to justify the slaughter with an attack on British foreign policy. Choudary claimed 'what he said in the clip, I think not many Muslims can disagree with'. Former army officer Tory MP Bob Stewart said he was confident the police were monitoring Choudary closely. 'He was sailing close to the wind but he knew exactly what was saying to make sure he didn't go too far. If he advocates racial killing we have a law against racially aggravated crime.' Yesterday Mr Stewart, a former Army colonel, . said the time had come to tear up human rights laws and deport . extremists deemed to be a threat to the public. He . said Labour’s Human Rights Act, which enshrines the European Convention . on Human Rights, should be scrapped immediately to allow the . authorities to take tougher action against terror suspects and those who . encourage them. Mr Stewart called on Home Secretary Theresa May to begin the process . immediately by deporting hate preacher Abu Qatada to his native Jordan, . where he faces terrorism charges. He . said the security services should go through the estimated 3,000 terror . suspects they are monitoring and take immediate action against any . deemed to be a threat. Mr Stewart, a former commander of UN . forces in Bosnia during the Balkans conflict, added: ‘It may not be as . democratic as libertarians would like but, I am sorry, we are fighting a . war.’ Hate preacher: The BBC released footage of Michael Adebolajo standing behind Anjem Choudary in 2007 .

"Autism may be caused by a missing gene, it has emerged. A team of scientists at Leeds University set out to investigate the gene neurexin-II, building on past research that has found some people diagnosed with autism are deficient in the gene. Mice who were deficient in the gene were found to display symptoms similar to autism in humans, including a lack of sociability or interest in other mice. Dr Steven Clapcote, of Leeds University, who led the study said: 'In other respects, these mice were functioning normally. The gene deficiency mapped closely with certain autism symptoms. 'This is exciting because we now have an animal model to investigate new treatments for autism.' Scroll down for video . Scientists found mice deficient in a gene called neurexin-II showed similar symptoms to autism in humans, including a lack of sociability or interest in other mice. They hope this could help model treatments (file pic) The researchers also looked at how the absence of neurexin-II affects the brain. 'We found that the affected mice had lower levels of a protein called Munc18-1 in the brain,' said co-author Dr James Dachtler, also of Leeds University. Munc18-1 usually helps to release neurotransmitters - chemicals that take signals across the gaps between cells in the brain called synapses. Lower levels of Munc18-1 mean the release of neurotransmitter chemicals could be impaired in the affected mice, and possibly in some cases of autism in humans, he said. Previous research established a link between the symptoms of autism and neuroligin-1, another gene associated with carrying signals across synapses. The Leeds-led study is the first to find a connection with neurexin-II. Dr Clapcote said: 'Not all people with autism will have the neurexin-II defect, just as not all will have the neuroligin defect, but we are starting to build up a picture of the important role of genes involved in these synapse communications in better understanding autism.' The study was published in the journal Translational Psychiatry. People with autism may gather information from faces in a different way to their peers, which scientists believe could explain why they gain different perceptions from faces. The discovery could help improve understanding of those diagnosed with autism, helping family members, friends and healthcare workers better communicate with them. Canadian researchers recruited 71 people, 33 people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 33 people without the disorder. The participants were presented 36 pairs of photographic and synthetic images of emotionally neutral faces. They were asked to indicate which faces appear 'kind' to them. People with autism may process information and gather clues about people's faces differently, a study found (file pic) With the photographic images, the judgements of the participants with ASD were mixed compared to the participants without the disorder. But the two groups made identical judgments about the synthetic images. The identical results suggest it is not the judgement process itself that is different in people with ASD, but the way they gather clues in the first place. 'The evaluation of an individual's face is a rapid process that influences our future relationship with the individual,' said the study's lead author Baudouin Forgeot d'Arc, of the University of Montreal. 'By studying these judgments, we wanted to better understand how people with ASD use facial features as cues. Do they need more cues to be able to make the same judgment?' He added: 'We now want to understand how the gathering of cues underpinning these judgments is different between people with or without ASD depending on whether they are viewing synthetic or photographic images. 'Ultimately, a better understanding of how people with ASD perceive and evaluate the social environment will allow us to better interact with them.'","Mice deficient in a gene called neurexin-II showed symptoms of autism .

"The family of Woolwich terrorist Michael Adebolajo said last night they were horrified by the murder.They revealed their ‘profound shame and distress’ and sent their ‘heartfelt condolences’ to the family of slain soldier Lee Rigby. In an extraordinary statement, they said they shared the horror of the nation at the ‘senseless killing’ and ‘fully expect’ that the killers will be brought to justice. They added: ‘We wholeheartedly condemn all those who engage in acts of terror and fully reject any suggestion by them that religion or politics can justify this kind of violence.’ 'Shame': The family of Michael Adebolajo, pictured carrying a knife and meat cleaver in the aftermath of the attack, have issued a statement condemning the 'senseless killing' of British soldier Lee Rigby . On another day of dramatic developments in the wake of the attack: . *  Adebolajo’s alleged accomplice . Michael Adebowale, 22, was transferred under armed guard from a hospital . bed to a high-security police cell for questioning; . *  Police raided a flat in Hither Green, south-east London, and told neighbours they were hunting for a ‘terror cell’; . *  Relatives of Muslim convert Hayden Allen, 21, suspected of helping the Woolwich killers, said he was ‘brainwashed’; . *  Adebolajo’s brother-in-law said he was ‘harassed’ by MI5 agents as they repeatedly tried to recruit him as an informant; . *  White convert Jordan Horner, 19, . appeared in court accused of trying to enforce Sharia law after being . arrested outside the home of hate preacher Anjem Choudary. Last night, counter-terrorism . detectives were preparing to question Adebowale, 22, over his role in . the Woolwich horror last Wednesday. He was caught on camera attempting . to fire a revolver before being gunned down by armed police officers. Murdered: Drummer Lee Rigby, of the British Army's 2nd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, was 'hacked to death' outside his army barracks in Woolwich last week . After being discharged by doctors, . Adebowale was re-arrested on suspicion of attempting to murder a police . officer, in addition to killing Drummer Rigby. It is understood that 28-year-old Adebolajo is in a far more serious condition and could remain in hospital for ‘some time’. Adebolajo’s family, who live in . London, Lancashire and Nigeria, took the unusual step of releasing a . statement through  their solicitors. They said: ‘Nothing we can say can . undo the events of last week. 'However, as a family, we wish to share . with others our horror at the senseless killing of Lee Rigby, and . express our profound shame and distress that this has brought to our . family. ‘We send our heartfelt condolence to . Lee Rigby’s family and loved ones. 'We wish to state openly that we . believe that there is no place for violence in the name of religion or . politics. We believe that all right-thinking members of society share . this view wherever they were born and whatever their religion and . political beliefs.’ So far, ten men have been arrested on suspicion of conspiring with the killers of the soldier. Among them was Hayden Allen, who was Tasered by armed police during a . raid on his home in Thamesmead, less than a mile from Woolwich. Family: Blessing Daniels, the sister of Michael Adebolajo, was pictured smiling as she stepped into an unmarked police car outside her home in Romford, Essex . Suspect: Michael Adebolajo was pictured with a group of Muslim extremists who fought with police outside the Old Bailey in 2006 . His grandfather said the convert, who . attended the same mosque as Adebolajo and Adebowale, was ‘brainwashed’ by Islamic preachers. Retired welder Noel Watson, 81, said: ‘Getting . deep into things will only get you in trouble. I tried to talk him out . of being a Muslim, but it didn’t register.’ A man accused of making threats on Facebook to make a bomb and massacre Muslims after the killing of drummer Lee Rigby has been arrested. Tony Perrin, 27, a scaffolder, was arrested close to his home in Norbury, south London, on Saturday May 25, after police were made aware of his alleged threats on the social network. He is accused of posting a message that was grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character. He has been bailed to appear at Hammersmith Magistrates’ Court on June 12. It has emerged that both suspects . were known to the Security Service and that Adebolajo was repeatedly . approached after he tried to travel to Somalia to join Al Qaeda . fighters. Guantanamo Bay detainee Moazzam Begg, . who runs a network to support terrorist suspects, said he was . approached by Adebolajo’s family in April 2012. He said: ‘They were in a state of . great worry and didn’t know what to do. His immediate family members had . been approached in order that he work with them.’ Meanwhile, teenage Muslim convert . Jordan Horner, who is also known as Jamaal Uddin, appeared in court . accused of being a  member of a radical group called Muslim Patrol. Horner was arrested outside the home of hate preacher Choudary after a . scuffle with photographers last Friday. Yesterday magistrates were told he . faces charges of assault and threatening behaviour following incidents . on four dates in December and January. In Kenya, local police are hunting members of the gang arrested with Adebolajo when he tried to cross into lawless Somalia. Police raided a Lincolnshire house which is believed to be connected with Woolwich murder suspect Michael Adebolajo last week . The curtains at the house in Lincolnshire remained closed following last week's raid . Neighbours said the same family had lived in the house for about a decade . Adebolajo was considered a ‘dangerous . radical’ intent on joining fellow jihadists Al-Shabaab when he was . captured close to the border in November 2010. The Kenyans claim the British . ‘ignored’ their warning about  Adebolajo, who they say was the . ringleader of the radicalised gang arrested after arriving on an island . near the border on a speedboat. But under pressure from the British . Embassy, Adebolajo was deported and his five co-accused were released on . good-behaviour bonds. Michael Adebolajo, 28, was born in Lambeth, south London, in 1985 to a Christian family of Nigerian descent. At the age of 15 or 16 he started getting involved in Islam and started to speak about Jihadi ideas. He . joined several extremist groups - including Al Muhajiroun - that were . banned in Britain and in 2003 converted to Islam, calling himself . Mujaheed while at Marshalls Park School. Fearing he had become radicalised, his parents moved him away from Romford to a village in Lincolnshire. He then went to university in Greenwich, living in Eltham while he was a student. A former friend told the Evening Standard that he was a Christian. The . friend said: 'He started getting involved with Islam aged about 15 or . 16, and that is why his parents moved him away out of the area. It is . utterly shocking to see what he has done. It’s unbelievable.' The security services, including MI5, were aware of him and his suspected accomplice Michael Adebowale, 22, from Greenwich. The Daily Mail has learned some of . the group have been under surveillance by Kenyan authorities since the . 2010 arrests. It is thought several may have remained in communication . with Adebolajo, who tried to re-enter Kenya last year. Now Kenyan police want to speak to . the five again so they can pass any new information to the anti-terror . officers at Scotland Yard. Ambrose Munysia, the commander of . Kenya’s coast province criminal investigations, said: ‘Some of them have . disappeared and we are trying to look for them in connection with what . happened in 2010.’ A block of flats in Harold Hill, Essex, where police and forensics staff searched a top floor home .

"Sad state of affairs: Eileen Battisti frowns as she talks last year about the situation that led up to a court decision about her home . A widow has been told for the second time by a Pennsylvania court that her home's sale at auction after she failed to pay property taxes is valid - she owed only $6.30 at the time it was sold. Eileen Battisti, 53, of Aliquippa, lost legal rights to her $280,000 home over two years ago after failing to pay the paltry sum but has made multiple appeals on grounds she did not know it was owed. The most recent decision made last week denied her request to reverse the September 2011 sale of a house she is still reportedly living in. 'I paid everything, and didn't know about the $6.30,' Battisti said. 'For the house to be sold just because of $6.30 is crazy.' She had previously owed . other taxes, the court noted, but at the time of the sale she owed just $235, including . other interest and fees. Beaver County Common Pleas Judge Gus . Kwidis wrote in his ruling that the county tax claim bureau complied with notification . requirements in state law before the auction. 'There is no doubt that (she) had actual receipt of the notification of the tax upset sale on July 7, 2011, and Aug. 16, 2011,' the judge wrote. 'Moreover, on Aug. 12, 2011, a notice of sale was sent by first class mail and was not returned.' Battisti also admitted to receiving those notices, the judge asserted, according to the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. He write in the ruling there “is no doubt' Battisti “had actual receipt” of them. The property sold for about $116,000, and she is entitled to $108,039 if subsequent appeals are unsuccessful, according to the paper. 'She's going to get that money, but . she's going to lose her house. All the notice requirements were met,' wrote Kwidis. 'In tax assessment laws, even if I feel sorry for her, I . can't do anything to help her. 'Everyone felt bad about it.' Her beloved home: Battisti's house was sold at far less than even half market value . An attorney for the purchaser did not return a phone message left on Monday. Joe Askar, Beaver County's chief solicitor, said the judge got the decision right, based on the law. 'The county never wants to see anybody lose their home, but at the same time the tax sale law, the tax real estate law, doesn't give a whole lot of room for error, either,' Askar said. Battisti argued her husband handled the paperwork for the property's taxes before he passed away in 2004. 'It's bad — she had some hard times, I guess her husband kind of took care of a lot of that stuff,' Askar said. 'It seemed that she was having a hard time coping with the loss of her husband — that just made it set in a little more.' Battisti told the paper she has no desire to collect the funds and will do everything in her power to retain possession of her home. Part of that process will include an appeal to the Commonwealth Court, which earlier ordered an evidentiary hearing that led to this ruling. She will be allowed to stay in the home until a final ruling is made.","Eileen Battisti insists she paid all taxes in full and was unaware she owed the addition $6.30 .

"A 27-year-old woman whose decomposing body was found on a New Mexico mesa left behind a cell phone video explaining she was lost, authorities said. 'There is a video of herself ... talking to herself ... talking about how she has been lost over two days at that point,' Sandoval County Sheriff Doug Wood said. Authorities suspect the remains are those of Brenda Lea Salas, a 27-year-old Bernalillo resident who disappeared in June 2012 following a fight with her boyfriend. Scroll down for video . Bittersweet discovery: Two years after Brenda Lea Salas, 27, (left and right) went missing on a New Mexico mesa, police believe they finally found her remains . Lonely resting place: A family looking for fossils on West Mesa, a desert area near Albuquerque, came across Salas' skeletal remains . She was last seen at a Walmart in nearby Rio Rancho wearing a gray Winnie the Pooh sweatshirt, blue jeans and Sketcher shoes, KOAT reported. . Two weeks after she vanished, her abandoned car was discovered stuck in the sand on a remote dirt road. For nearly two years, her disappearance baffled investigators who had combed a wide stretch of desert but found few clues. On Easter Sunday, Mike Zeyen, a mechanic from Rio Rancho, his wife, two daughters and the family dog - a German shepherd named Billy Jean - were out hunting for fossils on West Mesa, a desert area near Albuquerque, when they found human remains, the station KOB reported. Close to the bones were clothes, keys and the cell phone with the video, which has not been publicly released. Message from the grave: Officials found Salas' cell phone (pictured) in the desert, which the woman used to make a video of herself talking about how she has been lost for more than two days . Clue: Investigators came across what is believed to be Salas' keys to her Buick attached to a heart-shaped key chain . Police believe someone tried to dial 911 from the phone but the isolated area has no cell service. DNA . tests and dental records could take as long as two months, authorities . said. Wood said investigators will show the woman's family the message . after they're processed the video and other evidence. The medical examiner is investigating the cause of death. According to deputies, Brenda Salas, a mother of two, was last seen alive June 14, 2013, when she took off in her Buick after an argument with her boyfriend, Tim Vialpando. The next day, her family filed a missing persons report. Two weeks later, Salas' Buick turned up on a remote dirt road wet of Rio Rancho, but there was no sign of the woman. Startling find: Mike Zeyen (center) was in the desert with his daughters (pictured) when the family came upon a human jaw bone, a shoe and a cell phone . For two years, sherif's deputies had no breaks in the case, until on April 20 Mike Zeyen and his family stumbled upon human bones and a shoe in the dirt. It was also Zeyen who spotted Salas' cell phone. Salas' boyfriend has been serving time in the Valencia County Jail since last December on charges unrelated to her disappearance.","Brenda Lea Salas, 27, a mother of two, was last seen alive June 2012 driving off in her Buick after fighting with her boyfriend .

"A U-2 spy plane is being blamed for a software glitch at a Californian air traffic control center which led to delays earlier this week. Hundreds of flights were either cancelled or delayed on Wednesday afternoon and it was a relic from the Cold War that appears to be to blame. According to NBC News, the U-2 was flying at 60,000 feet, but air traffic control computers were attempting to keep it from colliding with planes that were actually miles beneath it. Hidden disruption: A Cold War-era U.S. Air Force U-2 spy plane forced the cancellation of hundreds of flights at and around LAX on Wednesday afternoon . The computers at the L.A. Center are programmed to keep commercial airliners and other aircraft from colliding with each other. The spy plane’s altitude and route apparently overloaded a computer system called ERAM, which generates display data for air-traffic controllers. Back-up computer systems also failed. The U-2 spy plane is the same type of aircraft that flew high-altitude spy missions over Russia 50 years ago and more recently Afghanistan. The aircraft passed through the airspace monitored by the L.A. Air Route Traffic Control Center in Palmdale, California. On Wednesday, Government officials were not immediately sure why the system had failed. Areas affected by the shutdown included Southern California, western Arizona, southern Nevada and part of Utah. Going nowhere: Hundreds of flights were either cancelled or diverted from Los Angeles Airport, one of the countries biggest airports. The FAA announced on Monday that it was the high-flying plane's complex flight plan that overloaded flight tracking systems, not 'spy signals' The center handles landings and departures at the region’s major airports, including Los Angeles International (LAX), San Diego and Las Vegas. At LAX there were 27 cancellations of arriving flights, as well as 212 delays. The FAA said that it was 'investigating a flight-plan processing issue' at the L.A. Air Route Traffic Control Center. It has not confirmed that the glitch was related to the presence of the spy planes operation. 'FAA technical specialists resolved the specific issue that triggered the problem on Wednesday, and the FAA has put in place mitigation measures as engineers complete development of software changes,' said the agency in a statement. The computer that failed is part of the En Route Automation Modernization system, known as ERAM. The F.A.A. has been rolling it out since 2008 in an effort to integrate data from more sources, increasing the number of planes that can be tracked and allowing more direct routing, among other improvements. Time to upgrade? Computer software at the L.A. Air Route Traffic Control Center in Palmdale, California (pictured) was unable to distinguish between commercial aircraft and the spy plane which was flying miles above . 'The FAA will fully analyze the event to resolve any underlying issues that contributed to the incident and prevent a re-occurrence.' NASA uses the planes to conduct scientific research. The U.S. Air Force is still flying U-2s, but plans to retire them within the next few years. The U-2 planes which were created in the 1950s to monitor Soviet nuclear sites. More recently they listened to Taliban phone calls and gave information on where Predator and Reaper drones should be deployed. They U-2 was once the workhorse of U.S. airborne surveillance, able to fly higher and faster than any other military jet at 70,000 feet.","Glitch occurred on Wednesday afternoon at 2 p.m.

"Some sex secrets are standard 'water cooler' material ('I'd do Chris Hemsworth in a heartbeat'). Others get spilt, along with the red wine, over dinner with good friends ('I miss what I did with my ex'). There's a couple we might tentatively whisper in the ear of a chosen few ('Do you ever, you know, feel a bit numb down there?'). And then there are those we don't share with anyone because they're, well, too personal and embarrassing. Scroll down for video . Shying away from asking those quirky sex questions? Tracey says you're not alone . Which is why I've chosen to answer a selection of the most common and quirky queries to plop into my inbox…. Can you get pregnant from oral sex? No. Sperm are clever little b@ggers and can wriggle their way past all sorts of obstacles but they haven't quite figured out how to dodge major organs like hearts and lungs and stuff to get to the bit where they can fertilise an egg. If he wakes up with an erection, has he been dreaming of sex? No. Most men have between 4-5 erections a night as a result of their sleep cycle. They may also have a biological purpose by ensuring the penis is regularly pumped full of oxygenated blood! Women also get 'erections' during the night: though because the clitoris is tiny, no-one notices! During intercourse, his testicles disappear! Should I be worried? It can be a bit alarming the first time you notice but nothing dodgy is happening. The testicles retract into the body because muscles in the area pull the scrotum toward it during sex. It's all to do with good old Mother Nature trying to keep things at the right temperature. She's also being protective and keeping them out the way of possible knocks during a particularly enthusiastic sex session. What happens if I lose a condom inside me? The good news is it won't get lost or move upwards (so those fears of coughing it up in front of your partner's Mum are well...silly). To remove it, squat down, reach in with a finger and feel around inside. If you can't find it, your doctor can. And you might need a visit anyway because the semen disappeared up there along with the condom. You could get pregnant or contract an STI. Will too much sex make me too loose? Quite the opposite - not enough sex can! Our vagina's are more a case of 'use it or lose it' (muscle tone that is). Popping out babies and age cause our pelvic floor muscles to loosen and atrophy. Regular sex helps tone them to keep your vagina tighter. Some of the most common sex questions Tracey is asked include seemingly basic issues such as 'can I get pregnant from oral sex'? Will anything happen to me if I swallow semen? Health-wise, it's not bad for you since semen is mostly water and mucus. There are traces of citric acid, salt, chloride, ammonia, absorbic acid, calcium, carbon dioxide and cholesterol (sperm are a mere 1% of ejaculate). The only problem though is rather a large one – if he carries a sexually transmitted disease, you may get it. Take your pick from the list of diseases that can be passed on this way (gonorrhoea, chlamydia, hepatitis B, the HIV virus). In fact, just touching your his penis with your mouth puts you at risk of contracting herpes, syphilis or human papilloma virus (genital warts) if they're present. There is some good news though – it's not fattening! There's a mere five calories in the average ejaculation. You know the thing about 'Is it in yet?'. Well sometimes I really feel like asking that question. I can feel him penetrate but that's about it! I don't think anyone will deny (men or women) that the first thrust is the best because that is when you feel it the most. The vagina becomes balloon shaped once you're aroused, meaning it's smaller and tighter at the entrance than it is deeper inside. Once thrusting continues, you also become desensitised to the sensation as your pelvic floor muscles tire and stop clenching his penis. Fix it by experimenting with different positions which alter the angle and put two firm pillows under your bottom while he's on top.

Roseanne Barr posted this photo of her bloody and swollen face,  apparently caused by a chemical peel . The 62-year-old comedian blamed her apparent facial injuries on Bill Cosby in the tweet's caption . But not before the comedian had thrown a number of her 263,000 Twitter followers into a frenzy of confusion, with many not quite getting the joke. While some noted that Roseanne's apparent injuries looked more like the result of cosmetic surgery than a scuffle, others responded with genuine concern and seemed to take the post seriously. One commentator asked: 'Are you for real or do you have a great make up artist?' Another stated: WHOA did Roseanne Barr really get attacked I hope she's joking . Roseanne quickly deleted the bizarre tweet and replaced it with another stating that she had just had a chemical peel and had been joking about the tussle with Cosby . 'Very confused by what's going on on @therealroseanne's Twitter right now,' a third Twitter user posted after the graphic photo emerged on the site. Speaking to the New York Daily News just days earlier, Roseanne had weighed in on sexual assault allegations against Bill Cosby. 'I don't wanna get sued or have him (Cosby) send anyone to beat me up, but I think it's obvious: 13 to 1,' she told the newspaper. At least 13 women have come forward claiming they were attacked by Cosby, with Renita Chaney Hill, Louisa Moritz and Andrea Leslie the latest additions. Speaking to the New York Daily News, Roseanne (right) had weighed in on sexual assault allegations against fellow comedian Bill Cosby (left) Four of the women claim they were teenagers at the time. One of the accusers is supermodel Janice Dickinson, who claims that during a dinner in 1982 the actor gave her a pill and when she woke up he was on top of her. Another four ladies; Barbara Bowman, Joan Tarshis, Tamara Green and Therese Serignese have all shared remarkably similar stories in which they claim to have shared a drink or a pill with Cosby and then woken up after or while they say he was sexually assaulting them. Carla Ferrigno, wife of Incredible Hulk star Lou Ferrigno, also claimed that Cosby tried to attack her during a gathering at his house in 1967. The comedian has never been charged and his lawyers have said the assault claims were discredited. Cosby's lawyer Martin Singer has branded the stories 'completely illogical' and added that the claims are 'increasingly ridiculous' and 'passed the point of absurdity'.

"A Texas family were shocked to discover last week that their 5-year-old Leonberger named Sid they thought was put down six months ago was being secretly kept by a veterinarian and allegedly tapped for blood transfusions. On Tuesday, police in Fort Worth raided the popular Camp Bowie Animal Clinic after being tipped off about allegations of animal abuse. Marian Harris, of Aledo, says that last October, she gave long-time veterinarian Dr Lou Tierce permission to euthanize Sid after the doctor told her that the pup was suffering from a congenital spinal disorder. Scroll down for video . Lucky dog: Sid the five-year-old Leonberger was rescued by his owners from an animal clinic in Texas where he spent six months locked up in a cage and used for blood transfusions . Reunited: Marian Harris rescued Sid from the animal clinic after being tipped off that her dog was not put down six months ago . But last Monday, Mrs Harris got a call from a former employee at the animal clinic telling her that her dog has been kept alive in a cage for the past six months. In a scene straight out of the 1992 family classic Beethoven, Marian Harris and her husband, Jamie, marched down to the animal clinic and discovered Sid imprisoned in a pen in a back room. ‘The betrayal is so incredibly intense . that nothing you have prepares you for the emotions. There’s anger, . there’s joy that you have your dog back, there’s betrayal of this . intense trust. And so it’s just really hard to camp on one particular . emotion,’ Harris told CBS DFW. Good Samaritan: Former clinic worker Mary Brewer called the Harris family to tell them that their dog was alive and used for experiments . The mother of two from Aledo said her pet, which was supposedly terminally ill, was able to walk and jump into her minivan on his own when she came to rescue him. The family drove the pooch to another clinic, where a veterinarian determined that Sid did not need to be put down at all. ‘It was like getting punched in the stomach and then some,’ Marian Harris told the station NBC DFW. ‘This has rocked our world. My kids are like, “How does somebody do this?” How does this happen?""’ On Tuesday, police officers descended on Camp Bowie clinic in the 5700 block of Lovell Avenue and seized two more dogs as evidence. The State Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners has launched an investigation to determine if any other animals were mistreated at the clinic. Late Wednesday afternoon, Dr Tierce spoke out in his own defense, calling the allegations against him 'a bunch of hooey.' Speaking to the Star Telegram, the veteran medic said that it was Mrs Harris who wanted her dog euthanized, but he could not bring himself to do it. Tierce also said Mary Brewer, who contacted the Harris family about their dog, was just a disgruntled former employee who wanted to get back at him. The former Camp Bowie staffer, however, insisted that she quit her job because she could not continue working in a place where animals are mistreated. For Sid and the Harris family, it all started last May when the family brought their 170-pound pet to the Fort Worth clinic to be treated for a minor anal gland issue, The Star Telegram reported. Dr Tierce told the Harrises he wanted to treat Sid with a new ‘cold laser’ and warned them that it could take the dog longer to recover, according to the family’s complaint filed April 22 with the Texas State Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners. By October, Sid’s condition has deteriorated to the point where he could not lift his hind legs and had to drag his body on the ground. Pet care: Police raided Camp Bowie Animal Clinic in Fort Worth amid allegations of animal abuse . Together again: The Harris family, (L-R) Jamie, Cole, Case, Marian pose with their dog Sid at their home Saturday, April 26, following their unexpected reunion . Around that time, Dr Tierce allegedly informed the owners that their dog had a congenital spinal defect, and the best course of action would be to put him down because there was no cure for his condition. The veterinarian even kindly offered to bury the 5-year-old Leonberger on his farm. The family gave Tierce the green light to euthanize Sid, and even brought their son, Cole, to the clinic to say his final farewell to the four-legged friend. ‘So I brought him [Cole] in and had our tearful goodbyes, and we went over very specifically our plans for burial of Sid, and that was the end of it,’ Marian Harris recalled. Then on . April 21, out of the blue Mrs Harris got a call from Mary Brewer, a . former employee at Camp Bowie, who told the woman that Dr Tierce never . euthanized Sid, and instead he has kept him around as a plasma donor for . other pets. ‘I . remember coming in and them extracting blood from Sid, and basically . shaving him, extracting his blood for the other animal upstairs,’ Brewer . said to MyFox DFW, adding that the dog was kept locked up almost the whole time, denied treatment and he had been injured by another worker. According . to the Harrises’ complaint, ’The clinic was using Sid (and other dogs) for blood transfusions and other experimental treatments.’ The road ahead: Sid returned from his forced six-month stay at the clinic with mange and will undergo rehabilitation . Tell-tail sign: Besides Sid, police also removed another dog from the veterinary center as evidence . Ms Brewer explained that she did not go to police right away because she has a criminal record, which could have undermined her credibility. When Marian Harris stormed into the clinic and found Sid living in a cage, covered in his own urine and feces, she confronted Dr Tierce about the deceit. Liar: James Harris said Dr Lou Tierce (pictured) lied to him when he said that his dog had a congenital spinal defect . ‘He said, “I didn't put him down because my staff said they would quit if I did,”’ said Mrs Harris. The veterinarian who evaluated Sid after his dramatic rescue found that the 5-year-old dog had mange and showed ‘definite signs of having been used for blood transfusions.’ In a brief phone interview with MailOnline Wednesday afternoon, Jamie Harris said that Sid is currently resting at home and is in 'reasonable health.' According to Sid's owner, the pooch still has rehabilitation ahead of him, but an MRI has confirmed that he never had a congenital spinal defect. Mary Brewer revealed that there was also a cat that Dr Tierce was supposed to put down because he had abscess in his mouth and could not eat. ‘Dr Tierce changed his name to Graling, had us put him in the dog ward and  left him there, and this time that I came back in in 2013, he's still there,’ said the former clinic staffer. Fort Worth police and the Tarrant County District Attorney will make a determination whether any criminal animal abuse charges will be filed against Dr Tierce - a licensed veterinarian since 1966 with a clean record.","Marian and Jamie Harris took their Leonberger to be put down at Camp Bowie Animal Clinic last fall after being told he had spinal defect .

"Kendall Jenner took the fashion world by storm this year - the reality star walked in numerous shows for the Spring/ Summer 15 shows in September. But with the success has come heavy criticism from some parts of the industry that the 19 year old was handed her modelling career on a plate thanks to her famous family. The teen has been keen to defend herself against these accusations in recent weeks - last week she gave an interview arguing that her success hadn't just happened magically. Scroll down for video . Kendall Jenner (left) claims she has worked hard for modelling career, but American model Arisce Wanzer has now written an open letter to the reality star, explaining why so many catwalk stars have had difficult accepting her recent success . She said: ''I’m not trying to use a family name or anything. In reality I worked pretty hard for this… It wasn’t like I just got it magically and it just happened.' Now, a new article in Look magazine claims the star has formed a game plan to ensure she continues to bag high-profile contracts, like her new ad campaign for Estee Lauder. Kendall isn't the first celebrity to get modelling contracts thanks to her family ties - she comes from a long line of attractive showbiz offspring who have featured in catwalk shows and adverts. Jade, Lizzie and Georgia May Jagger have all walked the runway for various fashion houses, as has Elvis's granddaughter Riley Keogh and Keith Richards's daughters Theodora and Alexandra. Even Pierce Brosnan's son Dylan recently featured in a campaign for Yves Saint Laurent. But Kendall is the most prolific of all of the models so far - she is also the only one to come from a reality television family as opposed to a Rock and Roll or acting dynasty. Arisce Wanzer is a model who is signed to BMG agency and has walked for shows like Topshop . American model Arisce Wanzer, who is signed to BMG agency, has walked for shows like Topshop and was hired as the face of Kenneth Cole, has hit back at Kendall's claims. In a open letter on The Blot website, she argues that normal girls have had to work much harder to gain even a fraction of Kendall's success and tries to explain the reason many normal models reacted the way they did to her sudden achievements in fashion. Arisce Wanzer has a blog on The Blot website that documents her life as a model . Arisce wrote: 'Dear Kendall, . 'Take a moment and remove yourself from your current situation, if you can, to a life that isn’t riddled with excess. 'Now, imagine you’re from a small town and/or Third-World country where your only way to get out of your current social class, achieve your dreams, get a green card or just gain better work conditions is to become a high-fashion model. 'You have to leave for six months to a year sometimes, signing contracts you can barely understand, let alone oblige to, almost without choice. 'You’re away from your family, your friends and everything you know. You live in a one-bedroom apartment with six other girls in the same situation in  New York City. 'You have to go to tutoring and/or English lessons in between learning how to “walk” at the agency, attending castings every other day, going on test shoots to get you experience, trying to learn your new neighborhood, going to the gym and hoping to maybe make some money all at once. 'Oh, and your apartment and test shoots aren’t free, by the way. They are added to your account with the agency, as are your casting outfits and cellphone. 'These are going to leave you in some serious debt if nobody books you for anything; some girls owe upward of $30,000 (£19,000) after a year of trying to book gigs. 'So now let’s pretend you actually lived through all of that, and it’s finally Fashion Week. Exciting, right? 'This could be your big break! You could send your family in Belarus or Woodbridge, Va., the money they need for your little brothers to have new clothes or even afford a plane ticket home for the holidays! 'Imagine standing in line after line of girls with your exact height and body measurements all day, each one hoping for a coveted spot on the New York Fashion Week runway. 'Casting after casting, and you just can’t seem to get your place. Kendall Jenner walks the runway at Tommy Hilfiger Women's fashion show during Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Spring 2015 (left) and poses on the red carpet with her sister Kylie MuchMusic Video Awards last June . 'But suddenly after a week full of the word “No,” killing yourself at the gym, exhausting yourself in classes, cutting your diet in half, not talking with your family and sleeping in a room with six equally exhausted girls, you get the call. 'Your agent texts you with an 8 a.m. fitting at Marc Jacobs. 'Oh my god, you’re going to walk for Marc Jacobs! This is a dream come true, someone finally said yes, and the prestige is beyond what you could have imagined! 'So you pack your model bag, a bottled water, your walking shoes and agency-approved casting outfit. This could be your big break, assuming they don’t cut your look last minute, a common practice done to no-name girls, so fingers crossed! 'It’s the morning of the show, and the subway is packed with lots of models, agents, buyers and fashion people in general, all exhausted, but ready to work. Kendall isn't alone - Lizzie and Georgia May Jagger (centre and right)  have both walked the runway for various fashion houses, as has Keith Richards's daughter Theodora (left) 'Backstage is a commotion circus of clothes, hair, makeup, yelling, Fashion TV interviews … it’s an Instagram overload! 'All the big names are there, your personal heroes including Karlie Kloss, Joan Smalls,  Anna Wintour, Marc Jacobs himself — the list goes on! 'But wait, isn’t that a reality TV star over there in hair and makeup? 'Yea, that’s definitely a Kardashian or something. What is she doing here? 'Did she take the subway? Was she at the casting? What agency is she with? I didn’t see her last season … . 'Does she need MORE fame? MORE money? A green card perhaps? 'This girl didn’t do and doesn’t owe half of what you did to get here today, that much is certain. 'Her mommy surely called a top agency, got her in the door and the design houses just chose to milk her fame like the cash cow that it is. Gigi Hadid, Justin Bieber, Kendall Jenner and Kris Jenner attend CR Fashion Book Issue N.5 : Launch Party as part of the Paris Fashion Week Womenswear Spring/Summer 2015 in September . 'One by one like dominos from Vogue to Givenchy, fashion is selling out to the ignorant masses for money. 'What happened to the art, the cerebral part of fashion? Did it really all die with Alexander McQueen? 'Gone is the prestige you once felt as a “chosen one” by Marc, Anna or Ricardo — this cheapens your entire experience. 'You thought you were special, that your hard work had finally paid off. You didn’t realize that these coveted spots were for sale. 'The cost? The soul and dignity of a fashion house.

"A Pakistani actress has been sentenced to 26 years in prison for blasphemy after appearing in a mock TV wedding. Veena Malik took part in the staged marriage on a morning show while musicians sang a devotional song about the wedding of the Prophet Muhammad's daughter. Her husband, Asad Bashir Khan, and the chief of the country's biggest media group, Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman, were also handed 26-year jail terms.

'I have always faced troubles by looking it in the eye': Pakistani actress Veena Malik has been sentenced to 26 years in prison after appearing in a mock TV wedding which a court ruled insulted the Prophet Muhammad . '26 years! Come on. 26 years is a lifetime... but I have faith in higher courts in Pakistan,' she said in an interview with a tabloid, according Gulf News. 'When the final verdict comes, it will do justice to me. Nothing bad is going to happen.' Judges have ordered the police to execute the court order in the city of Gilgit, which is controlled by Pakistan, but part of the Kashmir region which India also claims. 'The malicious acts of the proclaimed offenders ignited the sentiments of all the Muslims of the country and hurt the feelings, which cannot be taken lightly and there is need to strictly curb such tendency,' the order said. Blasphemous: Veena Malik took part in the staged wedding with her husband Asad Bashir Khan on a morning show while musicians sang a devotional song about the wedding of the Prophet Muhammad's daughter . Controversy: Mrs Malik's husband, Asad Bashir Khan, and the chief of the country's biggest media group, Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman, were also handed 26-year jail terms for their role in the mock wedding in May (above) However, the order is unlikely to be implemented because the Gilgit-Baltistan region is not considered a full-fledged province by Pakistan and verdicts by its courts do not apply to the rest of the country. Malik returned to Dubai two weeks ago from the U.S, but intends to return to Pakistan next month to fight her case. She said: 'I have always been a person who faced troubles by looking it in the eye. 'I have faced highs and lows in my life. But I am sure I haven't done anything wrong.' The host of the controversial show, which aired in May, has also been punished. '26 years! Come on... but I have faith in the higher courts': Mrs Malik, who has recently given birth to a baby boy, spoke of her anger and disbelief after the verdict was handed down by a Pakistani anti-terrorism court . The four people convicted were also ordered to pay a fine of 1.3million rupees (£8,000), sell their properties and surrender their passports, according to a copy of the court order. The broadcast by Geo TV set off a storm of controversy on social media, though similar routines by other channels in the past have largely gone unnoticed. Many observers at the time suspected Pakistan's military establishment of engineering the blasphemy campaign against Geo TV. The channel was then caught up in a struggle with the all-powerful military. The blasphemy case was registered on May 26 in a police station in Gilgit by a hardline sunni cleric Himayatullah Khan, deputy chief of the anti-shia organisation Ahl-e-Sunnat Wal Jamaat (ASWJ) formerly known as Sipah-e-Sahaba. No lawyer appeared on behalf of any of the accused. However the court had arranged a state lawyer to defend them.

"Dave and Liv Tyler made their first official outing as a couple last week at a party for his best friend David Beckham . Dave Gardner has a face that you might well recognise, but probably can't work out why. Since 2001, the eternally youthful football agent has been a permanent fixture in the background of celebrity photos - head down as the paparazzi jostle for pictures of his famous friends. But despite his low-key public persona, the 38-year-old has had a central position in two of London's most important social circles for more than a decade; he is David Beckham's best friend and also a key member of Kate Moss's Primrose Hill posse. And now, Dave has managed to bag one of Hollywood's brightest beauties, the actress Liv Tyler, and the couple are expecting a child together. So who is this man and how did he become one of London's most-connected men? It all started at the tender age of 14, when Dave joined the Manchester United Youth team. Even though the signing lasted for just five years, it was to eave a permanent impact on both his professional and love lives. It was at Manchester United that Dave became close friends with Ryan Giggs and also a young David Beckham. Gardner and Beckham were both promising sportsmen who spent every evening on the football pitch and quickly became best friends. But while Beckham went on to join Giggs as one of the best players of his generation, Gardner struggled to keep up  and left the club in his late teens. His time spent at the club wasn't wasted though - soon after he left, Dave set up the Elite Sports Agency with Six Alex Ferguson's son Jason, . The pair's contacts meant they soon became two of the biggest football agents in the Premier League. After a few years, Dave decided to start up his own company, which is still going strong today. Despite the pair no longer training together, Dave Gardner's friendship with Beckham has stayed the test of time and he is one of two old friends the superstar credits with keeping his feet on the ground. He is David's eldest son Brooklyn's godfather and just last week he and Liv attended a party in the ex-England captain's honour in London. Scroll down for video . Earlier this year, he was one of the friends the star invited join him on a 'find yourself' lads' holiday to Brazil. It was his friendship with Ryan Giggs that formed much of his personal life for the last decade though. Dave Gardner pictured with a David Beckham and Mazdack Rassi at the launch of Beckham's Haig whiskey . In Dave's early twenties, Ryan was dating his sister Emma, who he then dumped for the Hollyoaks actress Davinia Taylor. At the time, Dave was in a long-relationship with model Stacey Cooke and the couple were a permanent fixture on Manchester's social scene. But the relationship came to an abrupt end after Stacey left him for Ryan - the couple are still together to this day, despite revelations in recent years of Ryan's infidelity. A heartbroken Dave and Davinia - who is also heiress to a multi-million pound loo roll empire -  took solace in each other's company and it ended up being a match well-made as the pair eventually married in 2003. Dave Gardner with his ex-wife Davinia Taylor - the couple married in 2003 but divorced in 2010 . David Beckham was best man at the £875,000 wedding, while Atomic Kitten singer Jenny Frost was a bridesmaid. For the next few years, the couple were key components of the famous Notting Hill set - a group of well-known British stars including Sadie Frost, Jude Law, Meg Matthews, Sienna Miller and Rhys Ifans that centered around Kate Moss. In 2007, Davinia gave birth to their child - a son called Gray - and Kate Moss and David Beckham were named the godparents. For a while, it seemed that the couple had it all, Dave lavished expensive gifts on his wife and the pair regularly took groups of friends on holiday to Davinia's father's yacht in the Mediterranean. Dave with James Corden at a magazine party last year (left) and with celebrity friends Jamie Hince and Nick Grimshaw . But gradually, Davinia's troubles with alcohol and bipolar disorder proved too difficult and cracks started to appear in the relationship - according to reports,he was often left at home looking after the child. The pair divorced in 2010, with Dave citing Davinia’s ‘unreasonable behaviour’ as the grounds for the split and he gained custody of their three-year-old son. The couple sold their home Supernova Heights for £3 million to the comedian David Walliams. For a while Dave made very few appearances on the showbiz circuit and was hesitant to return to the dating scene. A short-lived romance with Stephanie Dorrance, who was the ex-wife of the heir to the Campbell's soup business, reportedly ended because he felt she was too flash with her cash. Then in early 2013, Dave hit the headlines again after it was revealed that he was enjoying a relationship with the popstar Rita Ora, who was 15 years his junior. Dave Gardner with ex-girlfriend Rita Ora and Harry Styles at a party in February 2013 . The pair were spotted on numerous dates and Rita was pictured doing the 'walk of shame' early one morning from his London home in the same outfit she had worn the night before. But the relationship was once again just a brief spell and Rita moved on to her now ex-boyfriend Calvin Harris, while Dave allegedly enjoyed a short dalliance with Kelly Brook. It was only in mid-July of this year that rumours first arose of his romance with Liv Tyler - the Hollywood actress and daughter of Aerosmith's Steven Tyler. Liv is no stranger to the British Isles - her previous husband and father of her first child is Leeds-born Royston Langdon from the band Spacehog. It has been reported that Kate Moss conspired to set the pair up after becoming convinced they would hit it off. Dave Gardner and Kate Moss- the supermodel introduced him to his girlfriend Liv Tyler . The supermodel was right - they have now been together for several months and recently joined the supermodel and her husband Jamie Hince on a holiday to Spain. The pair are already playing happy families - Dave's son Gray has already met Liv's boy Milo numerous times. A source told The Sun newspaper: 'This is the real deal. Dave and Liv are madly in love.

"A Texas family have won a nearly £3 million judgement against an oil giant after claiming that fracking operations near their 40-acre ranch left them suffering severe health side-effects. In what is believed to be the first successful legal action against a shale operator, Bob and Lisa Parr sued Aruba Petroleum for damages for a raft of illness they and their daughter Emma have suffered from for almost six years. They convinced a jury that the company's hydraulic fracturing operations had contaminated their water and land in Decatur leaving them suffering nosebleeds, nausea and rashes. Scroll Down for Video . Victorious: Bob and Lisa Parr with their daughter Emma have won almost $3 million from an energy giant that was fracking for natural gas near to their Texas ranch . Barnett shale: The fields around the Parr's Decatur home are one of the most successful and largest in the United States . 'They’re vindicated,' said David Matthews, a Houston attorney representing the family to the Dallas News. 'It takes guts to say, ‘I'm going to stand here and protect my family from an invasion of our right to enjoy our property.’ During the trial, Robert Parr testified his family were left unable to drink the water out of their well and Emma would wake up covered in blood sometimes because of terrible nose bleeds. While this is not the first lawsuit against an energy giant, this is the first successful lawsuit that went before a jury. Ill-health: The Parr's kept a detailed record of all the health issues they were suffering including nosebleeds . Most plaintiffs settle beforehand. 'My doctors asked me to start keeping up with what was going on in my area because no one could figure out what was wrong,' said Lisa to MyFoxDFW. Cattle born on the Parr's ranch were also deformed according to the lawsuit. The jury awarded the family $275,000 for lost property value, $2.4 million for past mental anguish,  pain and suffering by the couple and their daughter; and $250,000 for future pain and suffering. The lawsuit stated that the Parr's 'experienced almost continual sickness, annoyance, discomfort and inconvenience', due to the fracking operations. The Parr family live nearby the Wise County drilling site that lies upon the Barnett Shale, which is one of the largest natural gas fracking centers in the United States. Severe: Emma would wake up covered in blood because of the nosebleeds she suffered which began in 2008 . 'These are all classic symptoms tied to hydrocarbon exposure,' said Brad Gilde, a Houston attorney who represented the Parrs in the trial to the Dallas News. 'The boom hit the Barnett in 2008 and it just so happened that’s when the Parrs moved onto the ranch. Almost immediately their health effects started to manifest.' In a statement, Aruba Petroleum said it's in compliance with the Texas Railroad Commission and the Texas Commission on Environmental Equality. 'We contend the plaintiffs were neither harmed by the presence of our drilling operations nor was the value of their property diminished...Unfortunately, they delivered a verdict that we believe is counter to the evidence provided,' said a spokesperson in a statement for Aruba Petroleum. Relief: The Parr family lived in such miserable conditions that they had to leave their home at one point . Ben Barron, one of the attorneys representing Aruba said that they are in discussions over whether to appeal. 'It was arbitrary,' said Barron, ponting out that there are 100 natural gas wells within 2 miles of the Parr's property - some not operated by Aruba. 'How do you determine which well caused what, if any, damages?' 'The facts of the case and the law as applied to those facts do not support the verdict,' Aruba said in a prepared release. 'Natural gas development has long been prevalent in Wise County with hundreds of wells drilled and currently operated by dozens of companies. Aruba is just one of those operators.'","The Parr family of Decatur, Texas, first complained of falling ill in 2008 - after Aruba Petroleum began fracking operations near to their ranch .

"The flight of the bumblebee may seem clumsy and slow, but new research claims these humble insects can reach altitudes higher than the peak of Mount Everest. Despite their rotund bodies and relatively small wings, researchers from Wyoming found that bees can negotiate air so thin it would kill a human - making them the finest flyers in the insect world. In a series of experiments, scientists placed wild bees in a flight chamber and while all managed to fly at heights of 7,500m (24,606ft), two exceed heights of 9,000m (29,528ft). Despite their relatively small wings, researchers found that bees, stock image of a bee pictured, can negotiate air so thin it would kill a human. In a series of experiments, scientists placed the bees in a flight chamber and two exceed heights of  9,000m (29,528ft) Some animals have adapted to live in high altitude areas, where the air is thinner. Yaks, for example, live in the Himalayas at heights of up to 19,000ft (6,000m), and can struggle to survive at sea level. The highest living insect is a jumping spider called the Euophrys omnisuperstes that lives at heights of up to 6,700m (22,000 feet) on Mount Everest. Moss has been found to grow on Mount Everest at heights of 6480m (21,260 ft) and it is thought to be the highest altitude plant species in the world. The highest flying birds are Ruppell's Vultures, Bar-headed Geese, Whooper Swans and Bar-tailed Godwits, all of which have been recorded as flying at heights of more than 8,000m (26,200ft). Dr. Michael Dillon from the University . of Wyoming captured the six male bumblebees in a region of China that . sits 3,250m (10,600ft) above sea level. Dr. Dillon said he has even . found bees living in regions with altitudes of 4,800m (16,000ft). In 2008 a colony of bumble bees were discovered on Mount Everest at more than 5,600m (18,300ft) above sea level, the highest known altitude for an insect. By comparison, Mount Everest's peak sits at 8,848m (29,000ft) above sea level, and its summit is considered to be the limit of human endurance. If this summit was just 100m higher, it would be beyond the reach of climbers. Those venturing above 8,000m (26,200ft) are said to be entering the ‘death zone’. Dr. Michael Dillon from the University of Wyoming captured six male bumblebees in a region of China that sits 3,250m (10,600ft) above sea level. By filming the bees in the chamber, Dr. Dillon observed that to achieve these extreme altitudes, the bumblebees increased the maximum angle at which they flapped their wings, while keeping the same beat frequency. Forces produced by flapping wings are directly proportional to air density so organisms experience drastic reductions in lift forces in this environment. Flying insects also exhibit the highest known demand for oxygen compared to mass, making the bumblebee's feat even more worthy. At 9,000m (29,528ft), air pressure is about a third of that at sea level so it is harder to fly, with less air for wings to beat against.It is also harder to breathe. Dr Dillon said: ‘Animal flight at altitude involves substantial aerodynamic and physiological challenges. Hovering at high elevations is particularly demanding from the dual perspectives of lift and power output. The bumblebees were found to increase the maximum angle at which they flapped their wings, while keeping the same beat frequency. Forces produced by flapping wings are directly proportional to air density so organisms experience drastic reductions in lift forces in this environment . By comparison, Mount Everest's peak, pictured, is at 8,848m (29,000ft) above sea level and its summit is considered to be the limit of human endurance. To reach these heights, the bees increased the angle at which they flapped their wings, while keeping the same beat frequency . ‘Nevertheless, some volant (flying) insects reside and fly at elevations in excess of 4,000m (13,100ft). ‘Here, we demonstrate alpine bumblebees possess substantial aerodynamic reserves, and can sustain hovering flight under hypobaria (at altitude) at effective elevations in excess of 9,000m (29,258ft) - higher than Mount Everest.' During the flight chamber experiments, pictured, all the bees managed to fly at heights of 7,500m (24,606ft) meaning they could fly over at least seven of Everest's summits . Dr Dillon added: ‘The presence of such excess capacity in a high altitude bulmblebee is surprising and suggests intermittent behavioural demands for extreme flight performance supplemental to routing foraging.' In the past, bumblebees have been discovered on Mount Everest at more than 5,600 metres (18,000ft) above sea level. Some have been found living above 4,000m (13,100ft) for prolonged periods. Dr Dillon said: 'Maximum flight altitudes of insects are largely unknown other than from data obtained remotely with radar, and by the capture of individuals via aerial sampling. 'These studies suggest free flying insects typically ascend no higher than 5,000m. But these are typically insects migrating on air currents, so they benefit little from ascending beyond a few thousand metres. 'Many insect taxa have been captured terrestrially at 5,000 to 5,200m in the Himalayas, and several fly species and butterflies have, remarkably, been captured near 6,000m.' The research was published in the Royal Society journal, Biology Letters.","Bumblebees are known for being poor flyers due to relatively small wings .

"Katja Harjanne can still lift 100kg weights - despite being eight months pregnant. The 39-year-old, who is 38 weeks into her first pregnancy, is still lifting heavy weights at CrossFit sessions and believes the practice has helped her stay healthy throughout her pregnancy. Company pregnancy health and safety regulations at Katja's job as a conference and events sales manager mean that she can't even lift a water receptacle in the workplace. Scroll down for video . Katja had been doing CrossFit for three years before she became pregnant and has continued to train throughout, lifting the equivalent of a kitchen fridge . At 38 weeks into her first pregnancy, Katja believes the practice has helped her stay healthy throughout her pregnancy and fiancee Jason (with her, right) is supportive and proud . But in the gym she thinks nothing of hoisting the equivalent of a kitchen fridge. Katja, from Brighton, had been practicing CrossFit for three years before falling pregnant and after finding out she was expecting, she began researching the effects of exercise. She said: 'When I first fell pregnant I researched online and found a lot of positives about exercise and pregnancy. 'I spoke to the midwife in my initial visit and she told me to listen to my body. 'She said that strength training is fine and to keep it up. Although Katja is aware that some women have received criticism for exercising during pregnancy, she is confident that she is doing the best for herself and her baby . 'I trust my own judgement.' Katja continued her regime of weightlifting, cardio and gymnastics, altering her exercise as the pregnancy progressed. She continued to train up to five times a week, but scaled down her exertions to a level that felt safe for herself and her baby. She said: 'I have reduced the weights as my pregnancy has progressed and I only do what feels comfortable.' And Katja's fiancée Jason, 28, a fellow CrossFit enthusiast, has been supportive of Kat's continued exercise. Katja said: 'Jason is ever so proud. He CrossFits himself and thinks it's fantastic I'm keeping it up. Katja has continued her regime of weightlifting, cardio and gymnastics up to five times a week . 'He's been really supportive of me. Once in a while he does say I need to slow down a little bit because I am quite competitive on certain things, but mainly he's very supportive and proud of what I'm doing and achieving. 'We're both trying to find out information and be careful.' Jason, a flight stimulator technician, also researched the effects of pregnancy and CrossFit and helped Katja to adjust. He said: 'We sat down when we first found out she was pregnant and worked out how she could continue her training in a way that was safe for her and the baby. 'Eventually she started doing press ups on a box so her bump wouldn't hit the floor and she uses bands to lessen the strain of pull-ups. 'But she's really taken the reins herself and listened to her body. I fully trust her and she's done fantastically well.' But not everyone agreed with Katja's decision to power on with her CrossFit regime, including her soon-to-be mother-in-law. Jason said: 'My mother was slightly apprehensive of Kat doing exercise. Jason also researched the effects of pregnancy and CrossFit and helped Katja to adjust . 'She's of the old school era where doing things like this are slightly frowned upon and she would have preferred Kat to be at home resting. 'But Kat has shown that it is possible and really encouraged other women that you don't have to just sit down, you can be energetic, go for walks and go swimming, and that's perfectly fine for you and the baby.' Elsewhere reactions to Katja's intensive regime have been mixed. Katja said: 'Everyone at CrossFit has huge respect for what I'm doing as they understand the discipline and my dedication. 'Other people who don't know a great deal about CrossFit have been more worried and sceptical. 'My family are supportive but they just warn me to be careful and not to overdo it.' And although Katja is aware that some women have received criticism for exercising during pregnancy, she is confident that she is doing the best for herself and her baby. 'A hundred years back women didn't stop working in the fields because they were pregnant, they still had manual stuff to do,' she said. 'I train four or five times a week and I feel absolutely fantastic. My energy levels have kept up and it's helped me throughout the whole pregnancy. 'I'm not just swinging weights around, I'm taking care of my body and my baby and if something doesn't feel right then I try something else. 'I think sometimes we forget that life goes on and doesn't stop because you're pregnant - it's not an illness. 'And at the end of the day, I'm not doing what's right for other people, I'm doing what's right for me.' Now Katja and Jason are excitedly awaiting the birth of their new arrival. 'I can't wait to be a father,' added Jason. 'I can't wait to see the smile on Kat's face and just look in the baby's eyes and start this family rolling.'","Katja has continued her regime of weightlifting, cardio and gymnastics .

"Another woman has come forward with allegations of rape against comedian Bill Cosby, claiming that she was one of more than a dozen women to testify against him as part of a civil lawsuit in 2005. Donna Motsinger, 73, broke her silence in an interview with New York Post's Page Six Tuesday, revealing that she was known as Jane Doe No 8 in the lawsuit filed by former Temple University athletics director Andrea Constand. The married mother of three from Taos, New Mexico, said that she decided to speak out more than four decades later because she felt like 'coward' after staying silent for some many years. Scroll down for video . Another accuser: Donna Motsinger, 73 (pictured left) has come forward accusing Bill Cosby (right) of drugging and raping her in 1971 . Jane Doe: Motsigner said she was one of 13 women who agreed to appear as witnesses in a 2005 civil lawsuit filed against Cosby by former Temple University athletics director Andrea Constand (pictured) End of story: Constand reached a private settlement with the married comedian in 2006 . Motsinger said that the former star of The Cosby Show drugged and raped her in 1971 when she worked as a waitress at a jazz club in Sausalito, California. Bill Cosby married his wife, Camille, in 1964. The couple have five children. 'I feel guilty not telling my story,' Motsinger told The Post. 'I’m a coward over here. Those women are brave. 'It’s the least I can do. I want to tell people so [the victims] can’t be bullied, so they can’t be discredited.' On Tuesday, Mrs Motsinger, who lost her 33-year-old son, Dylan, in 2012, took to her Facebook page to offer more details on what made her come forward after all these years. 'My mother has known as has family and a few friends but it's something that I just didn't think I could be honest about with the world,' she wrote. 'If my son Dylan were still with me today he would tell me ""Mom, you have always taught us to be honest and stand up for our truth, it's only right you speak up now.."" Traumatic event: Motsinger, pictured left and right back in 1980s, said she was a waitress at a jazz club in Sausalito, California, in 1971 when Cosby allegedly drugged and had sex with her . Wife and mother: Motsinger has been married for more than 30 years and had three sons . 'Also my mother is very ill and I didn't want to do anything to bring her more discomfort but today she gave me her blessing to tell my story,' Motsinger stated. 'I wrote Mr. Cosby's attorney and asked him to please just have his client not demean the brave women who have come forward...but as you might expect they are determined to make these women out to be seeking money and or fame... 'I cannot sit back and just be quiet..be a coward..I want nothing from this man in any way. I want to be a friend to those who had the courage I didn't have...until now.' Andrea Constand, the former head of operations for the Temple University women's basketball team, filed a civil lawsuit in 2005 accusing Cosby of drugging and raping her in his Philadelphia-area mansion in 2004. Under fire: More than a dozen women have come forward in recent weeks with allegations that Cosby sexually assaulted them decades earlier . Thirteen women, among them Donna Motsinger, agreed to appear as witnesses in the case. Constand reached a private settlement with Mr Cosby in 2006. More than a dozen women have come forward in recent weeks with allegations that Cosby sexually assaulted decades ago, and in some cases, drugged them. Therese Serignese, a Florida woman, said Cosby assaulted her in 1976. Model Janice Dickinson, the most high-profile accuser, alleged in an interview with Entertainment Tonight that Cosby had sexually assaulted her in 1982. His attorney, Martin Singer, has called the growing number of sexual assault allegations 'unsubstantiated' and 'discredited' and accused the media of vilifying the actor and comedian once known as ""America's dad"" for his role as a loving patriarch on the hit sitcom The Cosby Show. Andrea Constand - A Temple University employee, she claimed in 2006 that Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in his Philadelphia-area mansion two years earlier. Cosby eventually settled this suit out of court as the prosecution said they had 13 Jane Does who would testify Cosby did the same to them in the past. Barbara Bowman - Bowman told MailOnline that Cosby raped and drugged her back in 1985 when she was a 17-year-old aspiring actress. Bowman was one of the 13 Jane Does in the 2006 trial against Cosby. Joan Tarshis - Tarshis claimed that she was just 19-years-old when Cosby drugged and raped her twice in Hollywood back in 1969 while she was working as a writer for him. Janice Dickinson - The supermodel  (pictured right) said in an interview that Cosby asked her to come to Lake Tahoe and talk about a television role in 1982, but ended up drugging and raping her. Tamara Green - Green, who first came forward in 2005 told MailOnline that she was an aspiring actress in the 1970s when Cosby gave her pills and pretended to care for her while she had the flu, but instead sexually assaulted her. Therese Serignese - Also one of the 13 Jane Does, she says she was 19 when Cosby drugged and raped her in Las Vegas after one of his shows. Louisa Moritz - She accused Cosby of sexual assault, saying he once forced her into oral sex, backstage at The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson in 1971, and implied he would further her career if she went through with it. Linda Joy Traitz - She said earlier this week that she was just 19 when Cosby drove her out to a beach and tried to get her to take pills to relax, before becoming 'sexually aggressive'. Traitz, of Hallandale Beach, Florida, has been charged in the past with trafficking pills. Cosby's attorney, Marty Singer, is trying to use Traitz's past to discredit her claims against his client. Beth Ferrier - Beth Ferrier claims she had relationship with Cosby in the mid-1980s. She claims that she awoke in her car with her clothes in disarray and not remembering what had happened. Ferrier has claimed that he drugged her coffee. Carla Ferrigno - The wife of Incredible Hulk star Lou Ferrigno, claims Cosby tried to sexually assault her during a gathering at his house in 1967. What's more, Cosby allegedly tried to use a friend to help court Ferrigno, and allegedly made his move on the former Playboy Bunny just moments after his own wife, Camille, left the room. Angela Leslie - The former model-actress claims that Cosby forced her to masturbate him in his Vegas hotel suite after giving her a strong drink in 1992. Renita Chainey Hill - The 47-year-old mother-of-three who met Cosby when she was offered a role on Picture Pages in Pittsburgh claimed he would fly her to different cities around the United States and drug her during a four-year relationship. Kristina Ruehli - A New Hampshire grandmother-of-eight, now 71, claims Cosby invited her back to his house for 'party'. She arrived and no one was there. Ruehli alleges that he drugged two bourbons he poured her and she came to when he was on top of her, shirtless. Victoria Valentino - The former Playboy playmate claims Cosby drugged her and a friend, tried to rape her friend then violated her instead in a Hollywood apartment after dinner. Jewel Allison - The former model accused Cosby of drugging her wine and making her feel his genitals before kissing her during a dinner at his home in the late Eighties. Michelle Hurd: The 47-year-old actress, best known for her roles on Law & Order: SVU and Gossip Girl, revealed she was a stand-in on the set of The Cosby Show when Cosby started acting inappropriately around her. In a Facebook post this weekend, she described being touched in ways she did not like and being asked to eat lunch with him in his dressing room. Then, things became too much for Hurd. 'I dodged the ultimate bullet with him when he asked me to come to his house, take a shower so we could blow dry my hair and see what it looked like straightened,' she says. 'At that point my own red flags went off and I told him, ""No, I’ll just come to work tomorrow with my hair straightened'''. Joyce Emmons: The former comedy club manager claims she woke up naked next to a friend of Bill Cosby after the comedian gave her a sedative when she complained of a migraine. Joyce Emmons told TMZ that the comedian slipped her Quaalude when she was in his Las Vegas hotel suite in the 1970s. She claims Cosby drugged her but has not accused him of sexual assault. Lachele Covington: The 20-year-old actress, who’d been an extra on the TV show Cosby, filed a police report in March 2000 against the star, accusing him of making an unwelcome sexual advance. According to The New York Post, after dinner and drinks at his home, he massaged her then 'guided her hand towards his sweatpants'. Cosby denied the claim and no charges were filed. 0 .","Donna Motsinger, 73, from New Mexico, broke her silence Tuesday about alleged rape .

"Most animals make noises that are innate, not learned. But scientists claim killer whales can learn to ‘talk’ like dolphins when the two species spend time together. This means the ocean predators join the likes of bats, some birds and humans that each copy sounds and use them in appropriate social contexts. Killer linguists? Scientists claim killer whales (pictured) learn to ‘talk’ like dolphins when they spend time together, joining species such as bats, some birds and humans that can copy sounds and use them in appropriate social contexts . They found that orcas can engage in cross-species ‘vocal learning’ by matching the types of sounds made by bottlenose dolphins when spending time with them. The results, published in The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, suggest that vocal imitation may enable social interactions in cetaceans. Killer whales have complex vocal repertoires made up of clicks, whistles and pulsed calls, which are repeated brief bursts of sound punctuated with silence. The acoustic features of the vocalisations - such as their duration, pitch and pulse pattern - vary across social groups. Whales that are closely related or live together produce similar pulsed calls that carry vocal characteristics distinct to the group, known as a dialect. ‘There’s been an idea for a long time that killer whales learn their dialect, but it isn’t enough to say they all have different dialects so therefore they learn,’ said senior research scientist Ann Bowles, of Hubbs-SeaWorld Research Institute in San Diego, California. ‘There needs to be some experimental proof so you can say how well they learn and what context promotes learning.’ Testing vocal learning ability in social mammals usually requires observation of an animal in a social situation that might stimulate it to communicate in new ways. Experts have found that orcas can engage in cross-species ‘vocal learning’ by matching the types of sounds made by bottlenose dolphins (pictured) when spending time with them . Like dolphins, killer whales depend on underwater sound for orientation, feeding and communication. They make clicks, whistles and pulsed calls. Clicks are believed to be primarily used for navigation and identifying objects such as prey in the environment but they are also used for social interactions. Members of a pod have similar calls known as a dialect, which is composed of types of discrete, repetitive calls. Newborns copy the call of their mother. It's thought that individuals learn their dialect though contact with their mothers and other pod members. Norwegian and Icelandic herring-eating orcas are believed to have different vocalisations for activities such as hunting and travelling. Now scientist have shown that they learn noises from another species – bottlenose dolphins. Dr Bowles said bottlenose dolphins provide a useful comparison species as they make generally similar sounds but produce them in different proportions, relying more on clicks and whistles than the pulsed calls that dominate killer whale communication. She said: ‘We had a perfect opportunity because historically, some killer whales have been held with bottlenose dolphins.’ By comparing old recordings of vocalisation patterns from the cross-socialised subjects with recordings of killer whales and bottlenose dolphins housed in same-species groups, Dr Bowles and her team were able to evaluate the degree to which killer whales learned vocalisation patterns from their cross-species social partners. She said all three killer whales that had been housed with dolphins for several years shifted the proportions of different call types in their repertoire to more closely match the distribution found in dolphins. This means that they produced more clicks and whistles and fewer pulsed calls. The researchers also found evidence that killer whales can learn completely new sounds. One killer whale that was living with dolphins at the time of the experiment learned to produce a chirp sequence that human caretakers had taught to her dolphin pool-mates before she was introduced to them. Dr Bowles said vocal learning skills alone don’t necessarily mean that killer whales use language in the same way that humans do. However, they do indicate a high level of neural plasticity - the ability to change circuits in the brain to incorporate new information. She said: ‘Killer whales seem to be really motivated to match the features of their social partners. ‘It’s important to understand how they acquire their vocalisation patterns, and lifelong, to what degree they can change it, because there are a number of different cetacean populations on the decline right now.’","Killer whales can engage in cross-species ‘vocal learning’ by matching the types of sounds made by bottlenose dolphins when spending time with them .

"'Shame on the New York Times,' bellowed a guest on Sean Hannity's radio show last night after the venerable newspaper printed the home address of Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson. The details were revealed in a news report on Officer Wilson's marriage to another police officer last month, less than ten weeks after he shot unarmed Michael Brown six times in a Ferguson street. The address was included in a report on Officer Brown's marriage to Barbara Spradling, a fellow officer in the Ferguson Police Department. Scroll down for video . We know where you live: Officer Darren Wilson, who shot unarmed black teenager Michael Brown six times in the street in Ferguson, Missouri, this summer, has had his home address published in The New York Times . Today a picture in the report been taken down, but the paper still gave the couple's address down to their road in 'a St Louis suburb about a half-hour drive from Ferguson'. Hannity, a prominent right-winger whose radio talk show is syndicated across America, was incensed at what saw as irresponsible reporting on the part of The New York Times . 'If anything happens to that man, his family, or that home, the culpability is with them,' he pronounced. A guest chimed in: 'If anything happens to them the family should own The New York Times.' Hannity and his guest said that Officer Wilson and his family could now be at risk of reprisals from the same people who burned businesses in Ferguson after the grand jury's decision not to charge Officer Wilson was revealed. A spokesman for The New York Times defended the decision to publish details of Officer Wilson's address. 'The story mentions only the name of the street where the couple have a house and that street has been widely reported on,' said Eileen Murphy in an email to the Washington Examiner.

Last night demonstrations continued to turn violent, with protesters breaking windows at City Hall and setting a squad care on fire. By the end of the night 45 people had been arrested in Ferguson, most for failure to disperse, though at least one person was taken in after being part of a group that was throwing smoke bombs, flares and frozen water bottles at a line of officers. It also came as tens of thousands of people in more than 170 cities across America - including Atlanta, Boston, Philadelphia, New York and Los Angeles - were demonstrating against the decision for a second night. Officer Wilson has been on paid administrative leave from Ferguson police department since killing Mr Brown on August 9. He and Officer Spradling, the new Mrs Wilson, have hardly been at their Crestwood property since the day of the shooting. Neighbours said they abruptly left days after.","Details revealed in report on Officer Wilson's marriage to another cop .

"Taylor Lianne Chandler has revealed that swimmer Michael Phelps pursued her on Tinder – but that they are no longer an item. Chandler, 41, claims to have had a romance with the US athlete, 12 years her junior, before he went into rehab in September and that they became involved after he approached her on the dating app. However, such is Phelps’ fame, that she wasn’t sure if the messages were coming from a made-up account. Scroll down for video . Taylor Lianne Chandler has revealed that swimmer Michael Phelps pursued her on Tinder . The real thing: Chandler explained that once she'd met up with Phelps, their relationship seemed quite serious . I'm yelling Tinder: A look at Phelps' alleged Tinder profile, which is how he and Chandler first met . She told The Daily Beast’s Aurora Snow: ‘He pursued me [on Tinder]. He was actually outside the age range for what my account was setup for. But what I’ve learned is when someone looks at whatever and likes you, even if they’re younger it shows up in your feed. ‘But at the time I just didn’t think it was real. You just figure it’s fake.’ Chandler explained that once they’d met up, their relationship seemed quite serious. She said: ‘We talked about the fact that I wasn’t looking to get involved with someone unless it was serious. I’m not ugly, so its not like men don’t approach me, but I wanted something real. And it felt real with him. I’ve been to his house four times, we talk everyday, and I’ve slept with him more than once.’ Chandler recently admitted on a Facebook post that she’d been born an ‘intersex’ - someone who had male genitalia, but no testicles, while also having a uterus and no ovaries . Party girl: An invite to Chandler's birthday celebrations in New York . The blonde says that she had a fulfilling sex life with Phelps, who made her feel ‘like the most beautiful woman in the world’. The pair are no longer together, but for reasons that Chandler won’t disclose. She insists that the split is not because she was forced to admit her past, and says that the reason  is for Phelps to disclose. Chandler recently admitted on a Facebook post that she’d been born an ‘intersex’ – someone who had male genitalia, but no testicles, while also having a uterus and no ovaries - with the name David Roy Fitch. She wrote: ‘I was never a man, never lived as a man. No one can say they knew me as a man or produce a photo of me as a man. 'There are people that remember me as an androgynous child at times because of what was forced upon me.' She had previously detailed their first date, to a Baltimore Ravens games, to the National Enquirer. Chandler claims she was with Phelps when he was arrested on suspicion of DUI on September 30 in Baltimore . Mystery: Chandler says that she's no longer with Phelps, but for reasons that he should explain . Feet in the sand: Chandler has been a champion for gender rights . In costume: Chandler dressed as Wonder Woman for Halloween with a pal . 'One thing led to the next, and we made love during halftime,' she claims in the interview. 'Later, we had sex again. The intimacy with him was amazing! It was the first time in my life that someone has made me feel like a true woman.' She also told the magazine that she never lied to the swimmer about her past, saying it just never came up. Chandler claims she was with Phelps when he was arrested on suspicion of DUI on September 30 in Baltimore, Maryland. The swimmer entered rehab just a few days after the incident and completed his program on Wednesday according to Chandler. Her choice: Chandler began taking testosterone blockers in her teens, and had corrective surgery in her early twenties to get rid of her male genitalia . Phelps, the most decorated Olympian of all time with 22 medals, is currently serving a six month suspension from swimming as a result of his DUI. In her post, Chandler also takes some time to discuss the difficulties she has faced in her life. 'In my early teens I was medically diagnosed and went on testosterone blockers, at 15 estrogen enhancers. My birth certificate was modified along with my name while I was a teenager, prior to any corrective surgery,' she explains. 'I originally changed my name to Paige Victoria Whitney. At 16 I legally emancipated from my family. I had already left home at 15. At 18 I got in trouble twice, once for a bad check and then a DUI.' 'At 19 I thought it would be smart to blackmail someone into giving me the money for my surgery. As soon as I received the money I was arrested and charged with extortion.' 'I spent 30 days in jail because I was too ashamed to tell my family what happened thinking no one knew. Even though my birth certificate and drivers license said female they put me in a cell with 3 men and I was raped.' She has since spent much of her life crusading for gender rights.","Taylor Lianne Chandler claims to have dated US swimmer Michael Phelps .

"A life-like outdoor statue of a man sleepwalking in just his underpants is causing a stir at the all-female Wellesley College, where some students have complained it's frightening. The statue of the nearly-naked man, who has his eyes closed with his arms outstretched in zombie-like trance, is part of an exhibit by sculptor Tony Matelli at the college's Davis Museum. But after it was placed in a busy area of the Massachusetts campus on Monday, it has prompted more than 270 students to sign an online petition at Change.org to have it taken down. Scroll Down for Video . Realistic: A statue entitled 'Sleepwalker' by Tony Matelli has frightened students on the all-female Wellseley College, where many have thought it was in fact a real, semi-naked man . The statue, 'Sleepwalker', is a 'source of apprehension, fear, and triggering thoughts regarding sexual assault' for many, according to a petition started by junior Zoe Magid, the Boston Globe reported. 'While it may appear humorous, or . thought-provoking to some, it has already become a source of undue . stress for many Wellesley College students,' the petition read. Museum director Lisa Fischman wrote on the school website and on the petition's website that the sculpture has succeeded in its goal of provoking discussion. 'We placed the Sleepwalker on the roadside just beyond the Davis to connect the exhibition - within the museum - to the campus world beyond,' Fischman wrote. Strange: Some students have been scared on seeing the statue - believing it is a real near-naked man . Spooky: After student complained, the museum director said good art was supposed to provoke . 'I love the idea of art escaping the museum and muddling the line between what we expect to be inside (art) and what we expect to be outside (life)."" In response, Magid told the Boston Globe that Fischman hadn't addressed their concerns. She 'didn’t respond to the fact that it's making students on campus feel unsafe, which is not appropriate,' Magid said. 'We really feel that if a piece of art makes students feel unsafe, that steps over a line.' Bridget Schreiner, who signed the petition, told the news site that the first time she saw the statue, she thought it was a real person on the campus. Artist: It is the work of sculptor Tony Matelli, left. Right, the work in his studio before it was finished . 'This could be a trigger for students who have experienced sexual assault,' she said. Art history student Annie Wang added that while art was supposed to make people think, the statue was not appropriate in its current place. 'Wellesley is a place where we’re supposed to feel safe,' she said.","'Sleepwalker' by Tony Matelli was put up at the campus on Monday as part of an exhibition of the artist's work at the college museum .

"The once squeaky clean boy band have spent almost as much time in tattoo parlours as they have on stage in recent years. With the sole exception of Niall Horan, One Direction have devoted hours to getting themselves inked from head to toe since hitting 18. The first to hit the ink was Harry Styles, who had an outline of a star tattooed on his inner bicep as soon as he reached 18 - and his band mates were quick to follow suit. Scroll down for video . Revelation: One Direction stars Harry, Louis, Zayn and Liam have revealed what their tattoos mean . Their designs include the obvious, such as Zayn's illustration of girlfriend Perrie Edwards, and the cryptic, among them the feather on Liam Payne's forearm. However, speaking in an interview with Teen Vogue, the boys opened up about the meaning of a few of their tattoos - some of it proving quite unexpected. Interviewed backstage during the Miami leg of their world tour, Harry, who famously got nine tattoos in just 10 months, revealed that he takes inspiration from the people he meets. 'We get to meet a lot cool people and they say stuff that sticks,' said the teen heartthrob. 'Some tattoos are just reminders of friends I've made - whether it be lifelong friends or those I've made in the past four years. 'It's nice to have people impact you in different ways.' Fan: Harry Styles famously returned to the tattoo parlour nine times in just 10 months . People power: Harry says he is inspired by the 'cool people' he meets as he travels the world . Not all of the boys think so deeply about their body art, however, with Louis admitting that several of his came about simply because he 'likes the look of them'. 'To be honest, not many of them actually have any meaning,' he explained. 'I just like to look at them. 'I started with a silly stick man. And then I like skateboarding, so that's why I got that one. This is for the world tour. This ""Oops"" is because I didn't like this line here, so I was like, ""Oops!""' Although Zayn and Harry were both quick off the mark, Louis gives both a run for their money in the tattoo stakes and also boasts a spider's web and a bomb ('because I'm da bomb') on his forearm. Ink: Zayn has an entire sleeve of tattoos on his right arm, many of which he has helped to design himself . Superheroes: Zayn says the Zap! tattoo relates to his childhood passion for comic books . Zayn revealed that his famous 'Zap!' tattoo came about because of a childhood fascination with superheroes. 'I'm a bit of a geek when it comes to comic books,' said the star. 'I've always had a bit of fascination with cartoons and comics.' The news may come as a surprise to dedicated Directioners, as the 21-year-old has previously claimed that the tattoo had an alternative meaning. In an interview with Nova.fm in 2012, Zayn insisted that the 'Zap!' tattoo referred to his own secret society called 'Club Zappers' in which he and Louis are captains. No reason: Louis says that there is no meaning behind his tattoos and he just likes to look at them . Unusual: Louis' earlier tattoos (left) were more basic than his famous bird on his forearm . Naughty: Louis caused controversy when he had the name of his old band The Rogues tattooed on his shins . Prior to making his bizarre claims public, many had thought that the comic book style tattoo was an acronym for 'Zayn and Perrie.' Whatever the real meaning of 'Zap!', the star has plenty more inkings to decode, among them a small black script on his collarbone. Taking to Twitter after having it done in 2012, he tweeted: 'For every1 asking what the new tatt means it says be true to who you are'. The performer also has his grandfather's name on his chest in Arabic as well as a Japanese symbol on his hip which means 'born lucky', while the yin and yang symbol is to be found on his wrist. Not impressed: Liam's mother reportedly loathes his tattoos with the exception of the feather . Tribute: The feather is a reference to his grandmother while the words beneath are a One Direction song lyric . Unmarked: Niall Horan remains the only member of One Direction to successfully resist the lure of ink . The final tattoo fan in One Direction is Liam Payne, whose most recent inking paid tribute to his band and involved having the lyrics 'I figured it out' from the song You and I added to his feather etching. The 21-year-old says his feather is especially meaningful to him - and even managed to impress his mother - because it refers to his deceased grandmother. 'My mum hates tattoos but she likes this one, because this one is specifically to do with my nan. That was actually the one that turned her around to tattoos and she was OK with it.' 'The feather was a thing, when I was a kid we used to find feathers around the house and whenever we found them my mum used to say it was my nan leaving them around for us to find, so that was quite sweet.' Liam's other tattoos include the words 'Everything I Wanted But Nothing I'll Ever Need' on his left forearm. He also has 'Only Time Will Tell' on his right wrist and four chevrons on his right forearm. Of his ankle tattoos, he says: 'These are the first tattoos I ever got. All of us apart from Niall have got these on are ankles. 'They're just crosses, the screws which keep you together. I suppose it's a keep you ground thing. Keep your feet on the ground.'","One Direction have come clean about the meanings of their many tattoos .

"A toddler could have been killed after an e-cigarette exploded 'like a firework' inches from his head, his parents said today. Alfie Worthington was playing in a bedroom when the e-cigarette, which was re-charging on a table, burst into flames and flew off 'like a Catherine wheel'. His mother Frankie Worthington, 22, from Norwich, said the explosion could have killed her 20-month-old son. She said: 'Thank goodness the table was in the way. If it hadn't been there in the way Alfie wouldn't be here now. That's the frightening thing of it - that took a lot of the blast. 'Lucky to be alive': 20-month-old Alfie Worthington, pictured with parents Frankie and Grant, was almost killed by an exploding e-cigarette, they claim . Scorched: The e-cigarette exploded 'like a firework' and damaged the wall, carpet and table it was charging on . 'The e-cigarette just exploded for no apparent reason. It was like a firework going off in here.' The  mother-of-one added: 'It was on fire and I dialled 999 - the e-cigarette is just obliterated. It just blew up.' She ran downstairs to get a bowl of water as her husband Grant, 24, pushed the bed away to stop the blaze spreading through the room. 'It was like a Catherine wheel,' added Mrs Worthington. Escape: Alfie was playing inches away from where the device burst into flames . 'It was just a white glow of sparks. I grabbed Alfie, who was screaming, and Grant jumped over the bed - he put some of the fire out with his hands.' The e-cigarette had been on charge all night before it exploded on Saturday morning  and the couple had just woken up. Mr Worthington, an engineer, said: 'If it had happened when we were out or asleep, heaven forbid. 'It could have been so much worse. 'The whole house could have gone up in flames.' A fire engine from Sprowston arrived at 7.35am after Frankie raised the alarm but they had already put the fire out. He said firefighters took thermal images to ensure the scene was safe while he's warned Trading Standards in a bid to prevent a future tragedy. He said they bought the increasingly-popular e-cigarette at a shop in Norwich in August and it did not have any instructions with it. 'It was nasty and frightening. The room quickly became a ball of smoke. People need to be aware,' he added. It came as  Linda James-Davies' Cardiff house was gutted by fire and she believes an e-cigarette charger was to blame.

The mother-of-two was convinced the device exploded while she ate beans on toast in her two-bedroom house. 'All of a sudden the fire alarm went off,' Linda said. 'I thought it had gone off accidentally but when I opened my bedroom door the room was alight.' The device was plugged in while the 56-year-old had a bath before her snack. 'I could see the fire was around the charger, which was plugged into an extension lead,' she said. 'That was where the fire was from. The fire officer said it was down to the e-cigarette when they put the fire out. My upstairs is gutted.'

"Joan Collins has spoken on camera for the first time about being raped by her future husband Maxwell Reed in a new documentary tackling sexual violence. The 81-year-old actress, who has previously written about the ordeal in her autobiography, tells how she was drugged and raped at the age of 17 when she was still a virgin and explains how her guilt drove her to marry the perpetrator of the crime. The emotional admission appears in Brave Miss World, a film which sees former Israeli Miss World, Linor Abargil, travel the globe meeting fellow victims. Linor was raped in 1998, six weeks before she was crowned Miss World and has made it her life's mission to encourage other women to speak out. Scroll down for video . Joan Collins in Brave New World: The speaks on camera for the first time about being raped by her future husband Maxwell Reed in the inspiring  documentary . The film sees former Israeli Miss World, Linor Abargil (pictured for the film, left, and when she was crowned in 1998, right) travel the globe meeting fellow victims . In the documentary, a sombre Joan  tells the former beauty queen of the harrowing ordeal. 'I was raped when I was seventeen years old,' says the star. At the time the actress had just been signed to RANK film studios and was already tipped for success. Joan then describes how she was on a date with Irish actor Maxwell Reed (who died in 1974), when he went to take a bath. He gave her a rum and coke to drink and some books to read. 'The books were porn, which I’d never seen before. Hardcore porn,' the 81-year-old remembers. Talking to Linor on the documentary, Joan says: 'I was raped when I was seventeen years old' The actress with Irish actor Maxwell Reed, who drugged and raped her when they were first dating . What happened next has stayed etched in the the actress's memory for the last 64 years. 'The next thing I knew, I was out flat on the sofa in that living room and he was raping me. And what he had given me was a drug. He had drugged my drink. 'It was what is called in those days a Mickey Finn. Which I think today would be Rohypnol. It felt so horrible. That I...that I'd done this thing.' In her naivety, a young Joan Collins felt terrible guilt. 'It wasn’t my fault but I didn’t know, I went out with him. And maybe I shouldn’t have gone out with him. He was much older than me, and he was a famous star,' she says. 'And anyway the bottom line is that he called me, and I went out with him again. And after I'd been going out with him for a few months, he asked me to marry him. 'And I thought, ""Well I better because you know, he took my virginity."" I really hated him, but I was so filled with guilt, that he had done this thing to me.' The actress then admits. 'It took a long time to be able to really trust any man.' Linor, who was raped just weeks before she was crowned Miss World, talking to Joan on the documentary . Linor, 34 a mother of three, has since found religion and swapped bikinis for a head scarf . Talking about the interview, 34-year-old Linor tells the MailOnline, 'It was very emotional to hear how Joan had felt so guilty about losing her virginity to this older man who had drugged and raped her, that she felt she had to marry him. 'She was so young at the time, and she entered into an abusive marriage. The post-rape circumstances are very different for a rape victim than for any other crime. 'We automatically try to minimize the impact of the abuse, which is something that is often not understood by police or society. A rape victim may not feel safe or able to report for a very long time.' The former model, who was attacked whilst working as a model in Milan, says it took guts for the Hollywood actress to speak out. 'When Joan found out about the film, she decided she would help us. It’s not something any of us want to do - to go on camera and talk about having been raped. 'But when you know that speaking up can give others the courage to come forward and press charges, and how many others will be saved by putting a rapist in prison, you want to do it,' says the mother of three. Filmed over five years and directed by Cecelia Peck, daughter of legendary actor Gregory Peck, the documentary, which shows Linor's meeting victims from American college students to young South Africans living in poverty, received a standing ovation at its UK premiere at The Jewish Film Festival last week. Linor Abargil (left) and Brave Miss World director Cecilia Peck, daughter of legendary actor Gregory Peck . Linor, who has since found religion and swapped bikinis for a head scarf, says the documentary was one of the hardest things she's ever done, but says she learnt so much from the experience. 'It made me grateful to live in Israel, where I was able to convict my rapist.  In India, in Pakistan and many other countries in the Middle East, if a woman spoke out about sexual violence she would be treated like a criminal herself. Those are the places where there is still so much to be done,' she says. 'But most rapes are committed by someone you know, in the family, in the workplace, in the community, in school, and this makes it very hard to speak up.' For Linor, the most powerful tonic during her ordeal was the support of her mother. 'Without my mum I could never have recovered. 'She gave me support from the moment it happened. She never made me feel ashamed or that it was my fault. I wish every daughter who survives a rape or assault, has a mother like mine.' Linor's terrifying assault happened when she was 18, six weeks before she was crowned Miss World. 'I had just been through the worst thing in my life and I had not begun to recover,' Linor says remembering the moment she was crowned. 'I was in shock because I didn’t expect to win. A Miss Israel had never won the crown. I didn’t think it was possible. 'It all hit me at once when the crown was put on my head. I didn’t know what would become of me or what would happen, but I knew it was for a reason, and now I know: it’s so that I can help other women not to stay silent.' The film shows Linor's meeting victims including American college students, young South Africans living in poverty (above) as well as high profile women . The trial of Linor's rapist took place during the year she was Miss World, but throughout she refused to have her name  or face concealed in media coverage, insisting that there was no reason to be ashamed. 'It was a very hard time,' she says. 'My rapist ended up being convicting and sentenced to 16 years in prison. After the trial I spoke out and said to all the women in Israel should not to be afraid to report the crime if it happened to them. 'Then I was quiet for ten years. I needed to heal. In 1998, Motty Reif (the film's producer) encouraged me to make a film about my story and the stories of other women. 'We went to Los Angeles to find the right team, and we met our director, Cecilia Peck and our producer and editor Inbal Lessner.' 'I wanted to encourage women not to stay silent, and not to blame themselves. I didn’t know how hard it would be, but I felt that it was my mission.' During the filming Linor suffered PTSD, but was determined to complete the project, which inspired those working with her as well as the thousands others that will benefit from seeing the final product. Director, Cecilia, says, 'Linor felt that she had recovered from the brutal rape crime, and was ready to reach out to other women.' Linor suffered PTSD during the filming but was determined to complete the project . 'But traveling around the world and hearing the stories of other survivors triggered her own trauma over and over, and she began to suffer symptoms of PTSD,' she explains. 'We never pushed her to continue, but her determination, in the face of how hard it was on her, was very motivating to all of us who worked on the film. 'Her transformation from teenage rape victim, beauty queen, and Israeli super model; into a religious mother, lawyer, and outspoken advocate on behalf of women around the world, was an epic, transformative narrative that unfolded over the five years we filmed with her.' Cecilia says the film's website has become a focal point for victims to speak out. Hundreds of thousands have visited the site, with many writing about the abuse they experienced and hundreds of emails arrive each day. For Linor, hearing from victims who are unable to seek justice has been the hardest part of the filming experience. 'I've been overwhelmed by how many women are suffering because they weren’t believed or given support,' she says . 'For myself, and so many women I spoke to, it’s so important to seek help, whether it’s from your family, a trusted friend, or a help line. Some women don't have access to justice, but you can’t heal if you keep it inside.'

"The candidate tipped to replace Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has bowed out of the race. Michele Flournoy, 52, withdrew her candidacy  on Tuesday citing 'family issues.' She had been the main contender for the top job at the Pentagon in President Obama’s second term. Withdrawal: Former U.S. Defense Under secretary Michele Flournoy has taken herself out of consideration for the Pentagon's top job . But she hastily announced her decision to step aside in a letter to the Center for a New American Security. The mother-of-three sent the letter to the think tank's board Tuesday saying she had asked the president to take her out of consideration for the Pentagon job over family issues. A source close to Flournoy said she had several concerns about the job, including whether she would be given more latitude than Hagel in policy making. Pentagon officials have long griped about White House micromanagement, and Hagel was largely seen as someone who would acquiesce to the West Wing. Flournoy, had previously served as a top Pentagon official during Obama's first term, then returned to the Center for a New American Security, the think tank she co-founded. The Oxford graduate's departure underscores the difficulty President Barack Obama faces while finding a candidate to take the helm at the Pentagon. He has been forced to make the decision late in his second term amid fierce criticism of his administration's handling of crises in the Middle East and elsewhere in the world. It is thought that he considered Flournoy to be an exemplary candidate. Departure: Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel's resignation, left, was announced by President Barack Obama, right, in the State Dining Room of the White House on Washington, Monday, November 24 . Mulling over key jobs: President Obama is attempting to find a candidate to take the helm at the Pentagon . She holds a Master of Letters postgraduate degree from Oxford, where she was a Newton-Tatum scholar at Balliol College. She spent two decades climbing to . the top of the notoriously male-dominated US national security . establishment, winning the admiration of politicians and military . chiefs. After working in the Pentagon under . Bill Clinton, Mrs Flournoy returned in the department’s Number three position — . undersecretary of defence for policy — when Mr Obama began his first . term in 2009. She resigned last February, saying she wanted to spend more time with her three children. However, since news of her departure emerged, several other candidates have become front runners. They include Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, who previously served as the Pentagon's general counsel, according to several people close to the process. Candidate: US Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson has emerged as a candidate for the top job . Johnson is highly regarded by the West Wing, particularly following the months long process he oversaw to identify the immigration executive actions Obama announced last week. But given Republicans' staunch opposition to that action, tapping Johnson for the Pentagon post risks turning his confirmation hearing into a fierce debate on immigration. Candidate: Other contenders for the top job at the Pentagon include Ashton Carter, pictured here . The president would also need to fill the top job at Homeland Security again just as the department is implementing the immigration actions. Two Pentagon veterans are also seen as contenders for the department's job: former Deputy Defense Secretary Ashton Carter and Robert Work, who currently holds the Number two job at the Pentagon. Still, Flournoy's decision to withdraw removes a candidate who was seen as being at the top of Obama's list. In 2012, she was considered for defense secretary and would have been the first woman to head the Pentagon. Hagel submitted his resignation Monday under pressure from the president. The former Republican senator struggled to break through Obama's insular inner circle of foreign policy advisers. And despite the White House's desire to have a less independent Pentagon chief, officials privately complained about Hagel's lack of engagement in national security deliberations. The White House would not comment on the process to nominate Hagel's successor. National Security Council spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan said: 'The president is considering a number of well qualified candidates however, I don't have any personnel announcements at this time.'","Michele Flournoy would have been the first woman to run the Pentagon .

The local man said Mr McAnna had no reason to run away, pointing out that his own companion that night had been an undercover police officer.

Police had said their prime suspect was a fisherman who had already fled the island on a private boat. But yesterday they said they wanted to swab every man across the island including fishermen and boat drivers who may have visited the area at the time of the killings, the BBC reported. Initial tests show DNA samples found on the bodies almost certainly came from two Asian men, though detectives said yesterday that they now believe at least three people were involved in the attack. Police Lieut-General Panya Mamen said all suspects had been questioned and two had been singled out . Thai police said they 'still believe sexual jealousy is at the heart of this crime'. Colonel Kissana Phathanachareon cited 'fresh evidence which could lead to a new suspect who may have had a relationship or one-night stand with Hannah or one of her friends or David'. The Bangkok Post last night reported police had narrowed their inquiry to two suspects – a Thai national and a Burmese worker. Police have come under fire for their handling of the case which critics say has descended into chaos. Local media in particular have turned on their force, claiming its incompetence stretches way beyond this investigation. The Thai capital's top-selling English-language newspaper, The Bangkok Post, wrote in an editorial yesterday: 'The handling of the investigation into the murders of British tourists Hannah Witheridge and David Miller on Koh Tao is an international scandal and should be a source of deep embarrassment. 'And it would be, except the egregious lack of professionalism displayed in this case is par for the course for the Thai police force.' Nevertheless, the commander in charge of the police force sought yesterday to reassure the public that everything was under control.' Briton Sean McAnna yesterday fled the island of Koh Tao  as he claimed two men he suspected wanted to find a scapegoat for the murders last week wanted him dead too. Mr McAnna, 25, from Shott, Scotland, hurried to the island ferry after making a desperate phone call for help in the dead of night from an all-night supermarket, where he had been hiding behind the counter from his pursuers. He had put out a desperate message on Facebook as he hid from the two men, declaring: ‘Thai Mafia are trying to kill me. Please help me.’ ‘I genuinely thought this was the day I was going to die,' he said an hour after his ordeal as he reflected on the murders of Britons Miss Witheridge and Mr Miller bludgeoned to death on a beach on the island a week ago. Mr McAnna, who had met Mr Miller a few times on the island on social occasions, thought back to the moment when two men who had chased him suggested he kill himself so he could be accused of taking his life because he was the person who had murdered Miss Witheridge and Mr Miller. 'I'd gone to a bar and a guy started asking me questions because he knew the guy who died and he had heard my name. I was a bit drunk and I started answering them about general things and the murders came up. Sean McAnna yesterday fled the island of Koh Tao in fear of his life as he claimed two men he suspected wanted to find a scapegoat for the two UK tourists killed there last week wanted him dead too . 'They just said to me ""It was you who killed them...you've got two people's deaths on your hands...we know it was you. You're going to hang yourself tonight and we're going to watch you hang. You will die tonight. If you don’t hang yourself, we will do it for you. You already have two people’s deaths on your hands.” 'So I just ran. I just left and ran. They wouldn’t have shot me - they would have taken me up into the hills to hang me and make it look like it was suicide. 'They chased me into a shop and I ran behind the counter. I went on my Facebook on my phone and took pictures of the guys and uploaded them straight to Facebook to say that if anything happens to me everybody knows who did it.' Tourists carry their backpacks after arriving by boat to the island of Koh Tao, where two British tourists were killed last week . Mr McAnna, who phoned his girlfriend Francesca, 22, in Italy to tell her that he was safe after his ordeal, said he believed the men needed a scapegoat because ‘I think they might know who it was.’ They needed someone to pin the murders on, he said, because they didn’t want the killers to be locals. ‘They want it to be a Westerner, so if I kill myself here, if I hang myself here, then it’s easy to say “See, it was him.”’","Police Lieut-General Panya Mamen said two suspects had been singled out .
He said police were 'confident' they had evidence about who murderers are .
'I am confident they will be arrested and charged this week,' he said ."
"Two children swapped at birth in a South African hospital blunder cannot be returned to their natural parents because they are too attached to their ‘adopted' mothers, a report has found. The biological mothers of the four-year-old children learnt last year that their babies had been swapped at the Tambo Memorial Hospital in Boksburg in 2010. It only became clear an error had been made when one of the mothers, from East Rand in South Africa, attempted to claim maintenance payments from the man she thought was her child’s father. Two children swapped at birth in a South African hospital blunder cannot be returned to their natural parents because they are too attached to their ‘adopted' mothers, a report has found (file picture) But according to sowetanlive.co.za, paternity tests then revealed that he was not the father – and she was not the mother. A legal expert has now recommended that the boy and girl should stay with the parents who have raised them since they were born, the website says. A report, drawn up by the University of Pretoria's Centre for Child Law director Ann Skelton, has now been handed to a court for consideration. If accepted it would see the mothers cutting legal ties with their biological children – although they would have contact with them. But they would then be treated as adoptive parents of the children they have been raising, sowetanlive.co.za reports. Skelton said the swap is likely to have happened after the midwife overseeing the births mixed up the files or the name tags of the babies on a ‘very busy’ day. She said that it was the first case she had heard of in South Africa where babies of different genders had been swapped adding that the families have a damages claim. One of the mothers had wanted her biological child back when she first found out about the blunder, but later acknowledged that it may not be in the youngster’s best interests, the report said. The other woman was left needing hospital treatment for shock at learning the daughter she had been raising was not hers. Skelton wrote that the second woman’s former boyfriend had been left ‘devastated’ by the news. ‘He said that the shock of the news … had left him devastated. He compared it to the loss of all his limbs,’ she wrote. She added: ‘The parents have suffered enormously and continue to be under considerable stress. The children are not yet aware of the problem, but the latest assessments indicate they are picking up on their mothers’ anxieties. ‘Although financial assistance will not solve all the problems, it will ease their current difficulties.’ Psychologists and medical experts are helping the families, who have ‘very strong’ bonds with the children they have been caring for from birth. The parents are to be offered the opportunity to respond to the recommendations and those involved are due to agree on a court date to consider Skelton’s findings.","Children were swapped at Tambo Memorial Hospital in Boksburg in 2010 .

"Prison guards nabbed an audacious cat after it was caught red-handed trying to smuggle two bags of cannabis into a prison in Moldova. The prison authorities are now looking for the moggy's trainer, who they believe may live in the nearby village of Pruncul and has been supplying inmates with illegal drugs for some time. The prison officers became suspicious of the grey and white cat, which regularly came and went through a hole in the fence, when they noticed it was wearing a peculiar collar. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

A second officer then cuts through two lumps in the collar, to reveal cannabis in its herb form. The Department of Penitentiary Institutions said yesterday that someone in the nearby village of Pruncul was using the cat as a courier to supply inmates with the drug at Penitenciarului Nr 9 prison. It is not the first time cats have been used in East European countries to evade capture by prison authorities. Contraband: Prison officers were alerted to the smuggling cat after noticing its suspicious collar . In June, guards caught a cat carrying mobile phones and chargers, that had been taped to its belly, to inmates in Penal Colony No. 1 near the city of Syktyvkar in northern Russia. And in August last year police in South Russia's Rostov region foiled a plot to use a cat to smuggle heroin into a prison, according to a report in the Moscow Times. The cat had been taken out of the prison by inmates following their release, who smuggled the animal out in their bags and gave it to drug dealers waiting outside. They then stuffed the drug into the cat's collar, and released the animal, which sneaked back into the prison. In a similar case in 2010, a heroin-carrying cat was killed by a prison do while trying to enter a prison in Tatarstan. The evasion tactics have also been used by inmates in Arapiraca city, in Brazil's northeastern Alagoas state. Earlier this year a cat was caught trying to slip through the gates with tools, including a saw and a drill, tapped to its body.

"Angelina Jolie has said that Labour’s proposed mansion tax could deter her from moving to England. The actress, who is rumoured to have been house-hunting in London, said: ‘I’m quite responsible about money.

She made sure she was the centre of attention on the red carpet in a rather unusual white silk two-piece by British designer Ralph & Russo. From the front, it looked like a fitted dress beneath a curious bolero cape. But the back was an even more striking affair, featuring a daring split and an array of buttons and bows. Hours earlier, the 39-year-old had been interviewed by Jon Snow on Channel 4 News. Asked about a possible move to the UK, she said: ‘It was just a rumour that started and I think the rumour came before I had even thought about it.’ But she added: ‘They’ve [the media] figured out that I’m quite fond of England. 'I have lived here before and in the future it would be very nice to have a foothold here for work. Some kind of an office I think would be nice.’ When asked about Mr Miliband’s plans for a punitive tax on people with homes worth more than £2million, she admitted: ‘That could put me off.’ Miss Jolie was presented with an honorary damehood (DCMG) in October for services to UK foreign policy and the campaign to end war zone sexual violence . Miss Jolie and her husband, actor Brad Pitt, were said to have been looking at properties in central London and had recently viewed a £25million Marylebone penthouse. If they do buy in the upmarket area, they will be moments away from celebrity hotspot the Chiltern Firehouse - where Jennifer Aniston, Princess Beatrice and Kylie Minogue have dined this month. Jolie has looked at homes priced at up to £20million, a local source told The Sunday Times.

The wildlife presenter wrote on Twitter: ‘I hereby confess that I am one of the mansion owning North London set that are apparently staunch Labour. Not this time. I shall vote GREEN.’ The plan has been attacked even within the Labour party as a ‘tax on London’, where 90 per cent of the homes that would be affected are. The couple have six children and their main home is Chateau Miraval in the south of France where they married in August.

In a reference to the Hear'Say song, Mr Miliband said the NHS needs a mansion tax 'Pure and Simple' TV viewers provided a running commentary on Twitter, describing how the singer was ‘doing a Paxman’ and ‘wiping the floor’ with the man who hopes to be the next prime minister. Appearing on ITV’s The Agenda, Miss Klass told him: ‘For me, it’s so disturbing – the name in its own right: “mansion tax”. 'Immediately you conjure up an image of these Barbie-esque houses, but in London, which is where 80 per cent of the people who will be paying this tax actually live, have you seen what that amount of money can get you? It’s like a garage. ‘When you do look at the people who will be suffering this tax, it’s true a lot of them are grannies who have had these houses in their families for a long, long time. 'The people who are the super-super rich buying their houses for £140million, this is not necessarily going to affect them because they’ve got their tax rebates and amazing accountants. It’s going to be the little grannies who have lived in those houses for years and years.’ Mr Miliband responded: ‘I totally understand that people don’t like paying more in tax. The values of my government are going to be different to the values of this government.’ TV viewers provided a running commentary on Twitter, describing how the singer was ‘doing a Paxman’ and ‘wiping the floor’ with the man who hopes to be the next prime minister .

"Cascading down a nearly 200 metre drop in Yosemite National Park, Bridalveil Fall is a breathtaking scene. But occasionally, when conditions permit, the magnificent waterfall is transformed into and even more spectacular sight. With just the right mix of water vapour and light, it becomes an ethereal rainbow haze that permeates the lush vegetation and dramatic rock faces around it. This spectacular phenomenon only last a few minutes, as the falling sunlight passes across the mountainous backdrop and catches the vaporised water. Stunning rare moment: This spectacular shot was captured as the late afternoon autumn light caught the mist from Bridalveil Fall, in Yosemite National Park, California. This picture is just one section of the full-frame picture snapped by photographer Mei Xu . But for patient photographer Mei Xu, it was certainly worth the wait. The fall, which stands at 189 metres, is famous for the mist that wafts off it when the breezes blow and which is said to resemble, as its name dictates, a bride's flowing veil. Native Americans named the fall Pohono, meaning 'spirit of the puffing wind'. Guarding the entrance to the valley, the Ahwahneechee tribe believed the fall was home to a vengeful spirit, and those leaving the valley would be cursed if they looked at it. But also, they said inhaling the mist from the fall would bring good luck to anyone looking to marry. Photographer Mei Xu was in the right place at the right time to capture this rare and magnificent moment, in Yosemite National Park, California . It's clear to see from Ms Xu's incredible picture why native Americans believed there was more to the fall than meets the eye. At times, when the wind is strong, the water appears to fall sideways, and during lesser water flows, the narrow spurt completely vaporises before it reaches the bottom. There are a number of vantage and viewpoints set up around the park for onlookers to watch the incredible spectacle. But only few lucky - and patient - observers will witness quite such a breathtaking scene as this. The magnificent natural phenomena was also captured last year by photographer Justin Lee, who was overjoyed to find himself in exactly the right place at the right time. Natural phenomenon: A waterfall in Yosemite National Park, California turns into a beautiful fountain of colour as sunlight reflects off its wet spray . Mr Lee, from British Columbia, Canada, . was standing close to a cliff at the Tunnel View lookout when he . spotted the colourful scene. He said at the time: 'The sun has to be in . position to get the rainbow, and this photo was not planned by me . beforehand. I just happened to be in the right place at the right time. 'I couldn't believe how lucky I was to see such a sight, and just had to start taking pictures straight away.' National park: The wonder was captured by photographer Justin Lee, who was overjoyed to find himself in exactly the right place at the right time . Mr Lee took hundreds of photos of the magical event. He said: 'I was there for about 30 minutes, snapping probably a couple of hundred photos at this particular location. The ideal conditions for a rainbow are the combination of sunlight and water droplets. This usually comes in the form of rain, but fine spray from a waterfall is often just as effective.","It's a breathtaking phenomenon that only happens when water and light conditions are exactly right .

"Sickening abuse at an illegal Florida slaughterhouse where where screaming animals were shot, stabbed, gutted, beaten with hammers and boiled alive has been captured on video. Described as the worst instance of animal abuse in the history of the United States, the horrifying treatment was exposed by in an undercover operation conducted by the welfare group Animal Recovery Mission (ARM) in conjunction with the Miami-Dade police. The investigation led to a raid and the arrest of the slaughterhouse's chief, Raul Fernandez, 53, a local drug dealer known by the name 'Freaky' on Monday on seven felony counts of animal cruelty. In the disturbing video, staff at the slaughter house are seen drinking beer and laughing hysterically as they torture the dying animals. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Shot but not killed: The ARM investigation captured footage of a slaughterhouse worker shooting a boar before dragging the animal 150 feet with a hook while it was still alive . Torture: The pig was squealing after it was shot and dragged more than 150 by a hook through its jaw . Beating: The cameraman watched as a worker beat a pig with a hammer before stabbing it and throwing it in boiling water while still alive . ARM sent a cameraman undercover to Fernandez's rural farm armed with a video camera in December of 2013, the height of the Christmas season, when demand for whole pigs for roasting is at its highest. The undercover cameraman posed as a customer who wanted to buy a whole pig. 'It’s monstrous. These operators are savages with no sense of humanity,' said ARM founder Richard Couto to the Miami Herald. 'On video surveillance, pigs can be seen being dragged, hook-mouthed through the jaw, at distances of approximately 150 feet, all while the animals remain alive,' according to an arrest warrant for Fernandez first obtained by the Miami Herald newspaper. ARM operatives said they documented children as young as 8-years old being forced to witness the alleged acts upon the animals. Hundreds of animals including pigs, sheep and goats were allegedly sold, according to ARM. Watch Video Here: . Cruelty: This sow's throat has been slit but the pig is still alive - and is about to be put into boiling water . Boiled alive: The sow was dunked into boiling water while still alive and kept under with wooden sticks . Despicable: This is Raul 'Freaky' Fernandez, 53 - who has been charged with seven felony counts of animal cruelty for operating his Miami-Dade slaughterhouse . Horrifying: Unlicensed slaughterhouses where animals are abused and mistreated are common in western parts of Miami-Dade County . The video also shows the moment the undercover cameraman agrees to buy a boar, at which point one of the slaughterhouse workers shoots the animal with a 'small-caliber' rifle. The boar, however, didn't die. After shooting the animal, the slaughterhouse worker puts a large hook through the animals jaw and drags it roughly 150 feet as it thrashed and squealed. In another instance, a slaughterhouse employee is seen bashing a pig in the head with a hammer, stabbing the animal and then throwing it into a vat of boiling water while it was still alive and squealing. The employee then used a shovel to hold the pig under the boiling water . Slaughterhouse horror: This is the location that ARM and Miami-Dade police on Monday . Skinned: A goat is hung up and skinned while its decapitated head lies on the floor to the right of its body in the image . 'No legitimate slaughterhouse operator or any self-respecting farmer would treat his livestock in such a ghastly manner,' Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle said in a statement. Fernandez, the alleged operator of the slaughterhouse is currently on probation following a conviction for marijuana trafficking. This is not the first local operation led by ARM that has led to arrests. In November, slaughterhouse owner Rudesino 'Rudy' Acosta pleaded guilty and took 10 years of probation after Couto secretly filmed the slaughter of animals in 2011. Couto revealed that the slaughter of the animals witnessed in this instance was so inhumane that four of his undercover operators quit after the probe. In recent years, authorities have made arrests for illegally butchering and selling the meat of horses, pigs and chickens.","Raul 'Freaky' Fernandez faces seven felony charges for running an unlicensed slaughterhouse where animals appear to have been tortured .

"Comic strip book Hipster Hitler has turned the Nazi dictator into trendy geek wearing black-rimmed glasses and a cardigan (pictured) A ‘jokey’ comic strip book called Hipster Hitler which turns the murderous Nazi dictator into a trendy geek has sparked outrage among the Jewish community. The widely available book shows the former German Chancellor wearing black-rimmed glasses, eating cashew nuts, playing Pac-Man and riding a bike with a basket on the handlebars. A group of Jewish activists has pledged to shred all the copies of the comic strip, which it says is ‘anti-Semitic’ and ‘sick’. Shania Angel, a member of London Stands with Israel - and whose grandmother died in the Holocaust - has said the group plans to boycott stores which sell the book. Miss Angel, 23, told the Ham & High newspaper: ‘The book is a disgrace and should be banned. ‘T-shirts are now being sold of Hipster Hitler - it's turning Hitler into a cute and trendy character. ‘It's offensive to people like me who have had family members killed in the Holocaust.’ She added: ‘Anti-Semitism has skyrocketed recently and we shouldn't be selling books like this. ‘We should boycott shops that sell it, we should protest outside their stores and do everything we can to make sure these aren't being sold.’ Ilana Katz, a fellow member of the group, said: ‘If we can't get shops to stop selling copies we'll buy and shred them all. ‘Since when was it okay to promote Hitler as a cool person?’ But the New York-based authors James Carr and Archana Kumar say the book is a ‘parody’ and is not intended to offend anyone. They state: ‘None of the views expressed should be confused with the actual views of the authors, advertisers, the hosting company, any service providers or the owner of this domain name. ‘Everything... is intended to spoof, parody and satirise.

The images, including this one showing him riding a bike with a basket on the handlebars towards field marshal Rommel, have sparked outrage among the Jewish community who say the book is 'sick' The book, which was published after becoming a success online, is described as a 'notorious, irreverent strip' which 'reveals how today's subculture personalities fetishise the authentic to create a new variety of conformism'. It states: ‘Using a combination of puns, parody, dark humour and visual gags, the exploits of the Third Reich and the activities of the everyday Hipster are lampooned in a knowing fashion. ‘The online strip has garnered huge numbers of fans with an acerbic deconstruction of the hipster urban tribe.’ Authors James Carr and Archana Kumar say it is a parody and not intended to be offensive (front cover, right) The dictator is also pictured wearing slogan t-shirt 'Save the Panzer' and  arguing with his Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels, calling him a 'kibitzer' - a Yiddish term for someone giving unwanted advice . However, CK, a publisher at Jewlicious.com, writing a post on the site about the book said: 'It’s kind of creepy perhaps but frankly, anything that ridicules Hitler I figure is pretty good for the Jews. And for mankind.' Various comic strips from the book - which is being sold on Amazon and in book stores like Waterstones for £12.99 - include Hitler saying he doesn't like 'Kosher salt', wearing a t-shirt stating 'Death Camp for Cutie', 'Save the Panzer' and '1941: A Race Odyssey'. The dictator is also pictured arguing with his Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels, calling him a 'kibitzer' - a Yiddish term for someone giving unwanted advice - for interrupting him, eating cashew nuts and wearing a beanie hat. Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in 1933 and a dictator of Nazi Germany in 1934. His reign came to an end in 1945 when he took his own life. He was a veteran of World War I before he joined the National Socialist German Workers' Party and eventually became leader in 1921. The Nazis wanted to maintain the purity of the 'Aryan Race' and sought to get rid of people they considered 'subhuman'. Around six million Jews were systematically murdered during the Nazi regime under the command of  Hitler, in what became known as the Holocaust. Nazis also persecuted and killed millions of people including approximately three million Ukranians, over two million Poles as well as Slavic, Soviets and Romani people. People with mental disorders and disabilities, homosexuals, political opponents and religious dissidents such as the Jehovah's Witnesses were also killed. Figures suggest the total death toll of the genocide stands at around 17 million.","Comic strip shows Hitler wearing black-rimmed glasses and playing Pac-Man .

"A woman who lost her pet rabbit was left sickened after the animal was apparently filmed being tortured to death by thieves in an online video. Rebecca Atkinson's white lionhead rabbit, Percy, is believed to have been stolen from its hutch in Seaham, County Durham this weekend. The whereabouts of the rabbit remained a mystery until Mrs Atkinson went online and saw a video which she says shows her pet being tortured to death. The video appears to show three young men in the bath with a rabbit thought to be family pet Percy . The video, . which was posted on Sunday morning just hours after the rabbit . disappeared, showed three young men naked in a bath with a white rabbit . matching that belonging to Mrs Atkinson. She claims the video then went on to show it being set alight and thrown out of a window. Mrs . Atkinson's husband, Anthony, said: 'We only thought that Percy was . stolen so we reported it to the police but we never even imagined that . someone could do something like this to her. 'When . she received a message showing her what happened to the Percy we were . gobsmacked. It's disgusting and sick, what ever goes through people's . minds? Ms Atkinson's daughter Jessica has told of her shock at the apparent theft and killing . 'To . torture an animal in that way and throw it out of the window is . inhumane, we can't stop thinking about how much she would have suffered. 'We are all heartbroken. Rebecca and the kids cried all night and haven't slept.' Mrs . Atkinson, 31, had only bought Percy three weeks ago with her male rabbit . companion, Ken, for her children Jessica Lennox, 14, Aaron Lennox, 10 . and Brynn Atkinson, four. Percy . has left behind five 11-day-old babies who are now left without a . mother. Rebecca and her husband are currently hand feeding them. Mrs Atkinson's daughter Jessica . said: 'We are having to look after the babies ourselves now. I've named . them all, it's so upsetting that their mum has been taken away. 'Ken has become really restless now, he knows something is wrong. I just can't believe anyone could be so cruel. 'I want to keep some of the babies as a reminder but we aren't sure if we believe that they will be safe here.' The . family were told about the video by friends who had seen it after it . was posted on a social media site in the early hours of Sunday morning. They . could not bear to watch the horrific scenes themselves, but have been . shown a screen grab of their pet in the bath, and the nature of the . torture has been described to them. The image has shocked hundreds of social media users who went online to show their disgust. One . user, Rachel McNicholas, wrote: 'Vile vile vile. Even worse are the 59 . people that's liked it. Hope its been reported to police.' Jackie Johnson also said: 'This is disgusting they need punishing, the poor animal, disgraceful behaviour.' Pet rabbit, Percy, was stolen from a hutch behind the family home in Seaham, County Durham . Jules Stringer added: 'Am heartbroken reading this it's absolutely sick, how can anyone do something like this to a poor animal?' Two men, aged 19 and 20 and a teen, aged 17, have been arrested and bailed over the incident and another 16-year-old remains in custody. A spokesman for Durham Constabulary said: 'Police are investigating the theft and subsequent death of a white lionhead rabbit. 'The rabbit is believed to have been stolen from its hutch sometime between Friday evening June 27 and Saturday morning June 28. 'Anyone who has any information regarding this incident is urged to contact Durham Constabulary.'

"No mother of the year: This 37-year-old woman, whose booking photo has been blurred to protect her daughter's privacy, is charged with child endangerment after it was revealed the 12-year-old was pregnant . An Iowa mother was arrested on child endangerment charges after it was discovered that her 12-year-old daughter became pregnant after being allowed to sleep with a grown man. The 37-year-old woman from Newton was taken into custody Friday following an investigation that revealed that the mother did nothing to stop 24-year-old Jacob White, a family friend, from sharing her then-11-year-old daughter’s bed. MailOnline is not releasing the woman's name to protect the identity of her daughter due to the nature of the crime. The mother allegedly ignored comments from multiple witnesses that White was having sex with the girl. According to police, the victim also tried to tell her mother about White's behavior, but the woman would not listen. When a recent doctor’s visit revealed that the young girl was expecting, the 12-year-old allegedly said to her mother:’I tried to tell you several times,' stated a police report obtained by Newton Daily News. Jacob White now faces a third-degree sexual abuse charge for allegedly impregnating the child. The girl and the man twice her age reportedly slept together in April and May, but the mother took no action. The Newton woman's neighbors told WHO-TV they were not surprised by the allegations against her, claiming that her house is known in the area as a place where random people come and go at all hours of the day. 'Sick': Jacob White, 24, allegedly impregnated the suspect's child when she was just 11 years old while sharing a bed with her . The mother is currently out of jail. She has been ordered not to have any contact with her daughter. Her next court appearance was scheduled for September 9. Police said the woman is facing criminal charges because she is the parent of a minor who knowingly permitted the continuing physical abuse or sexual abuse of a child.","The 37-year-old Iowa woman allegedly did nothing when her daughter told her that a family friend Jacob White, 24, was having sex with her .

"A young British ex-pat fled the 'murder island' of Koh Tao in fear of his life today as he claimed two men he suspected had killed two UK tourists there last week wanted him dead too. Terrified Sean McAnna, 25, from Shott, Scotland, hurried to the island ferry after making a desperate phone call for help in the dead of night from an all-night supermarket, where he had been hiding behind the counter from his pursuers. He had put out a desperate message on Facebook as he hid from the two men, declaring: ‘Thai Mafia are trying to kill me. Please help me.’ Scroll down for video . Terrified: Sean McAnna (pictured leaving the island today), 25, from Shott, Scotland, hurried to the island ferry after making a desperate phone call for help in the dead of night from an all-night supermarket, where he had been hiding behind the counter from his pursuers . Tragic: Hannah Witheridge, 23, and David Miller, 24, were found bludgeoned to death with a garden hoe on the beach on September 15 . ‘I genuinely thought this was the day I was going to die, ' he said an hour after his ordeal as he reflected on the murders of Britons Hannah Witheridge, 23, and David Miller, 24, bludgeoned to death on a beach on the island a week ago today. Mr McAnna, who had met Mr Miller a few times on the island on social occasions, thought back to the moment when two men who had chased him suggested he kill himself so he could be accused of taking his life because he was the person who had murdered Miss Witheridge and Mr Miller. 'I'd gone to a bar and a guy started asking me questions because he knew the guy who died and he had heard my name. I was a bit drunk and I started answering them about general things and the murders came up. 'They just said to me ""It was you who killed them...you've got two people's deaths on your hands...we know it was you. 'You're going to hang yourself tonight and we're going to watch you hang. You will die tonight. If you don’t hang yourself, we will do it for you. You already have two people’s deaths on your hands.” Terrifying: Mr McAnna said he was in a bar on the island when a man started asking him questions about the murder of David Miller (pictured before his death in a red cap). When he answered, the man told him, 'You're going to hang yourself tonight and we're going to watch you hang' Threats: He said if he hadn't run away and hid in a supermarket, the men would have taken him to the hills 'to hang me and make it look like it was suicide' 'So I just ran. I just left and ran. They wouldn’t have shot me - they would have taken me up into the hills to hang me and make it look like it was suicide. 'They chased me into a shop and I ran behind the counter. I went on my Facebook on my phone and took pictures of the guys and uploaded them straight to Facebook to say that if anything happens to me everybody knows who did it.' Mr McAnna, who has phoned his girlfriend Francesca, 22, in Italy to tell her that he was safe after his ordeal, said he believed the men needed a scapegoat because ‘I think they might know who it was.’ They needed someone to pin the murders on, he said, because they didn’t want the killers to be locals. ‘They want it to be a Westerner, so if I kill myself here, if I hang myself here, then it’s easy to say “See, it was him.”’ Mr McAnna said the police answered his distress call when the men had fled and escorted him to the guest house where he was staying. But he feared the two men would know where he lived, so he fled for the second time that night - this time running into the jungle, where he remained in hiding until daylight. Scapegoat: Mr McAnna said he believed the men needed a scapegoat because ‘I think they might know who it was’ ‘I made my way down to a bar that I know and I slept for about an hour under a pool table at about 7am. ‘I was really scared in the jungle, so I kept moving every 30 minutes in case anybody had seen me. I would move from one place to another, just to keep out of sight in case anyone came looking for me there.’ Mr McAnna, who arrived on the island two weeks ago to work in a bar and do some busking with his guitar, said he had spoken to the British Embassy by phone during the hours in the jungle ‘in case I got taken somewhere else. But there is only so much they can do for somebody who is on a tiny little island in Thailand.’ Bungled: He does not believe the police have any chance of catching the killers. They had acted too slowly, he said, and had failed to seal the crime scene allowing people to trample over it and destroy much of evidence that might be there . The former St Aidan’s (Scotland) schoolboy said that during his ordeal he telephoned his mother Anne - his father was killed seven years ago in a motorcycle accident - to tell her that he loved her because ‘basically I wanted to say my goodbyes. I was so scared.' He added: ‘I told her that if this was going to be the last conversation that we had then it was a really sad one, but she’s been great and I love her.’ Mr McAnna has his own theory about what happened on the night that Miss Witheridge and Mr Miller died - a theory that is in line with a suggestion by the Mail last week and which Mr Miller’s parents tend to agree with. The Scotsman said he did not think Miss Witheridge was with Mr Miller when she was attacked and raped, but he had come across the scene and had run to help her - resulting in his own death. He does not believe the police have any chance of catching the killers. They had acted too slowly, he said, and had failed to seal the crime scene allowing people to trample over it and destroy much of evidence that might be there.","Sean McAnna says he was chased by men who quizzed him about murders .

"The Transport Security Administration has been criticized for humiliating a cancer survivor at a security checkpoint for wearing an incontinence pad. The man's wife has told that he suffers from OAB (overactive bladder) after a battle with prostate cancer and wears adult diapers for his condition. At an airport security checkpoint recently, he was forced to explain his situation multiple times to TSA officers, one of whom announced that he was wearing a diaper for the whole security line to hear, and then underwent an embarrassing back-room search. Public humilation: A woman has told the story of her husband's embarrassment at an airport TSA checkpoint . The man's wife, writing anonymously, described her husband's ordeal on the forum CafeMom. She writes that her husband, after waiting for a lengthy time in the security line at an unnamed airport, had had a 'bladder spasm' and had wet the incontinence pad. When he went through security, he was asked if he was carrying any liquids in his clothing. He explained his condition to the female TSA officer, who called over her male boss and tried to explain the situation to him. 'The problem was he did not understand what an ""incontinence product"" was when she told him,' writes the man's wife. Long illness: The woman's husband was left incontinent after suffering prostate cancer . 'Myself, [my husband], and the female TSA employee tried explaining a few times before the woman finally just shouted ""HE IS WEARING A DIAPER"" which caused pretty much everyone to turn and stare at us.' Then, she adds, the TSA officer 'snickered.' To add to the couple's humiliation, the TSA agents told them their scanner was unable to detect what was beneath the man's clothing and forced him to take off the diaper so that they could inspect the 'suspicious padding,' writes the man's wife. Insensitive: The woman said the TSA officers didn't seem to understand the meaning of 'incontinent' and forced her husband to hand over his soiled diaper . The officers needed to conduct a 'further review' of the man's diaper, and took him into a room with four TSA agents who subjected him to another pat-down before making him change into a fresh adult diaper and hand over the soiled one. The couple were finally cleared to leave, but the frustration and humiliation the ordeal caused made the woman's husband cry, a very uncommon occurrence, she says. 'Frustrating that people have to go through this in the name of security. We have neither security nor freedom now, just lots of embarrassing and frustrating stories,' she wrote.","A woman has written a blog post about her husband's humiliation at the hands of TSA agents .

"A Maine elementary school teacher has been barred from school after visiting Dallas, Texas, where Ebola patients have been treated - despite having no contact with any suspected sufferers. It comes after hundreds of parents removed their children from a middle school in Mississippi  because the principal visited Zambia - 3,000 miles from any countries struck by the deadly disease. The drastic measures across the United States follow news that the CDC is not entirely sure how to control the virus. Scroll down for video . Drastic: A teacher has been ordered to stay away from Strong Elementary School in Strong, Maine, after going to an education conference in Dallas, Texas, and staying 9.5 miles from the Ebola-hit Presbyterian Hospital . Fears: Hundreds of parents removed their children from Hazlehurst Middle School amid fears of Ebola after Principal Lee Wannik visited Zambia, which is 3,000 miles away from countries hit by the virulent disease . Officials revealed the teacher at Strong Elementary School in Strong, Maine, was placed on mandatory 21-day leave after going to an educational conference and staying in a hotel 9.5 miles from Texas Health Presbyterian, where 'patient zero' Thomas Eric Duncan was diagnosed and treated before he died. She was one of five million people who commute through the Texas city. However, the school cited 'parents' concerns' and ordered the teacher to remain in isolation for three weeks - the incubation period for Ebola, Portland Press Herald reported. 'At this time, we have no information to suggest that this staff member has been in contact with anyone who has been exposed to Ebola,' the district wrote in a statement published on its website. 'However, the district and the staff member understand the parents' concerns. Therefore, after several discussions with the staff member, out of an abundance of caution, this staff member has been placed on a paid leave of absence for up to 21 days.' Despite one scare over a patient who tested negative for the disease earlier this week, there have been no Ebola cases in Maine. Nowhere near: Principal Wannik was on the other side of Africa from Ebola-hit nations for his brother's funeral . Crowds: Streams of families were crowded into the school gym to fill out absence forms . Meanwhile in Mississippi, a rumor emerged that Principal Lee Wannik of Hazlehurst Middle School had traveled to Nigeria, prompting swarms of parents to remove their children from the school on Wednesday. In fact, he had been attending his brother's funeral in Zambia, which is on the other side of Africa from Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone where the disease has wreaked havoc. Families at a nearby high school also filled out forms requesting a temporary absence for their child, telling journalists they would 'rather be safe than sorry'. Fears were escalated further when Principal Wannik then decided to go on leave and seek medical attention because he did not want to be a 'distraction'. 'He did not want to be a distraction to the educational process and decided to take personal vacation leave and volunteered to go see any additional medical help that he could,'  Superintendent John Sullivan told WAPT. Scare: Hazmat teams rushed to a bus station in Dallas yesterday after a woman who doesn't have Ebola spat . Yesterday, panic hit Dallas, with a bus and train station brought to a standstill, after a woman reportedly vomited at the facility, sparking fears she had Ebola, but the transit authority now say she was never on a watchlist as someone exposed to the virus. Panic broke out after the woman exited a northbound train at the White Rock Station and was sick on the platform, leading the Dallas Area Rapid Transit system to close the station as a precaution. However authorities have now said that, contrary to reports, the woman was not on a watch list of potential people exposed to the virus and had only spat on the platform. Dallas Fire-Rescue have revealed that the woman did live in the same apartment complex as 'patient zero' Thomas Eric Duncan, who was admitted to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on September 30 after catching the deadly virus will in Liberia. And while she had no contact with the man, who died on October 8, officials were still treating the situation very seriously. The incident highlights the heightened state of awareness of the dangers of spreading the disease, especially in Dallas, where the Liberian national became the first person infected with the virus to die in the United States. Two nurses who cared for him have also contracted the virus.","Maine elementary teacher stayed 9.5 miles from Ebola hospital in Texas .

"She has been ridiculed, stared at in the street and called 'the world's ugliest woman' by insensitive cyber bullies. But, after years of misery and self doubt, Lizzie Velasquez says she can finally shrug off the hurtful comments about her looks as 'just words'. Miss Velasquez, from Austin, Texas, was born without adipose tissue - meaning she has no body fat and, despite eating up to 60 small meals a day, remains at a delicate 4.4stone (58lbs). Scroll down for video . Battle: Lizzie Velasquez says she has had to face being stared at and bullied because of her unusual looks . The rare condition still baffles doctors and is thought to affect just two other people worldwide. Miss Velazquez has now written a second book about her struggle to be accepted and hopes it will help others in a similar position. In Be Beautiful, Be You the 23-year-old college senior shares advice on being unique, how to make and keep good friends and how to deal with bullying and negativity. Speaking to Dr Drew Pinsky on Tuesday night about her experiences, Miss Velasquez said when cyber bullies first started attacking her online it was hard. Rare: Miss Velasquez was born without any adipose tissue, meaning she has no body fat and, despite eating up to 60 small meals a day, remains at a delicate 4.4stone (58lbs) Lizzie Velasquez was born without adipose tissue, meaning she has no body fat and, despite eating up to 60 small meals a day, remains at a delicate 4.4stone (58lbs). Her syndrome is so rare that to this day it remains undiagnosed. Besides Miss Velasquez there are only two other people in the world known to suffer from the condition. The main symptom is the inability to gain weight. Miss Velasquez is also blind in one eye and has limited vision in the other. The 23-year-old says her condition is particularly puzzling because it takes on aspects of other syndromes, including progeria. Miss Velasquez says she has the pointed nose, small mouth and ageing skin of someone with progeria but her syndrome is not though to be terminal. As she says on her website her condition is 'just one big mystery', but she remains hopeful that one day doctors will discover just what it is and how to treat it. She told Dr Drew: 'I'm human... of course these things are going to hurt... (but) I'm not going to let those things define me.' Eventually Miss Velasquez realised the people issuing the hurtful comments online were just cowards hiding behind a computer screen. 'At the end of the day, these are just words,' Miss Velasquez told Dr Drew. 'If they are so proud, then they should show their face.' When asked how she deals with being constantly stared at in the street Miss Velasquez said: 'I'm starting to want to go up . to these people and introduce myself or give them my card and say, ""Hi, . I'm Lizzie - maybe you should stop staring and start learning"".' Miss Velasquez also revealed she does not have any desire to look like a beautiful celebrity. She . said: 'I feel I'm really glad I don't look like the celebrities out . there who are beautiful, because there are a lot of stereotypes attached . to that. 'People . think ""she's so pretty, she must be really dumb"". Since I don't look . like that it's better because people can get to know the real me.' Miss Velasquez was born four weeks prematurely weighing just 2lb 10oz. Doctors found . there was minimal amniotic fluid protecting her in the womb. 'They told us they had no idea how she could have survived,' Miss Velasquez's mother Rita, 45, a church secretary, said. Dinner: Miss Velasquez says she has to eat high calorie food every 15-20 minutes to keep her energy level high . 'We . had to buy dolls' clothes from the toy store because baby clothes were . too big.' Doctors could not make a diagnosis so they prepared Miss . Velasquez's parents for the worst. 'They . told us she would never be able to walk, talk or have a normal life,' said her mother, who has two other children with Miss Velasquez's father Lupe - both children are of average height . and weight. Despite the grim prognosis Miss Velasquez's brain, bones and internal organs developed normally but she was always very small. At the age of two she was still only 15lbs - the same as the average five-month-old baby. Born this way: Miss Velasquez, aged two, (left) and pictured a couple of years ago, right. The university student has never weighed more than 4.3stone. She went blind in one eye aged four . Born with two brown eyes, when Miss Velasquez . was four the right began to cloud and change hue. Doctors then . discovered she had gone blind in that eye. 'They still don't know why it happened but now I have one blue and one brown eye.' Miss Velasquez's case has fascinated doctors . all over the world and she is part of a genetic study run by Professor . Abhimanyu Garg at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical . Center in Dallas. Support: Miss Velasquez with her supportive family, mother Rita, father Lupe, brother Chris and sister Marima. No one else in her family has the syndrome . Professor . Garg and his team now believe Miss Velasquez may have a form of Neonatal . Progeroid Syndrome (NPS), which causes accelerated ageing, fat loss from . the face and body, and tissue degeneration. People with PRS often have . triangular and prematurely aged faces with a pointy nose. He said: 'I am aware of a small number of people that have similar conditions to Lizzie but each case is slightly different. 'We cannot predict what will happen to Lizzie in the future, as the medical community are yet to document older people with NPS. 'However . Lizzie is lucky to have healthy teeth, organs and bones so the outlook . is good. We will continue to study her case and learn from her.' Miss Velasquez doesn't take medication but she relies on vitamin supplements and iron . to stay healthy.  It is thought she should be able to conceive naturally . without passing the condition to her children.

"Karla Washington worries how she will afford new school uniforms for her five-year-old daughter. Washington, an undergraduate student, earns less than $11,000 a year from a part-time university job. The salary must cover food, rent, health care, child care and the occasional splurge on a Blue's Clues item for her only child. 'My biggest fear is not providing my daughter with everything that she needs to be a balanced child, to be independent, to be safe, to feel like she is of value,' said Washington, 41. One in five in poverty: 14.7million - or 20 per cent - of children in the U.S. live in families with incomes below the federal poverty level . Washington's economic woes are seen throughout Nevada, where the nation's highest unemployment and foreclosure rates have combined to devastate families and empty neighbourhoods and construction yards. A national study on child well-being published today found Nevada had the highest rate of children whose parents are unemployed and underemployed. The state is also home to the most children affected by foreclosures — 13 percent of all Silver State babies, toddlers and teenagers have been kicked out of their homes because of an unpaid mortgage, the study found. Across the nation, the research by the Annie E. Casey Foundation found that child poverty increased in 38 states from 2000 to 2009. As a result, 14.7 million children, 20 per cent, were poor in 2009. That represents a 2.5million increase from 2000, when 17 per cent of the nation's youth lived in low-income homes. In the foundation's first examination of the impact of the recession on the nation's children, the researchers concluded that low-income children will likely suffer academically, economically and socially long after their parents have recovered. 'People who grew up in a financially secure situation find it easier to succeed in life, they are more likely to graduate from high school, more likely to graduate from college and these are things that will lead to greater success in life,' said Stephen Brown, director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. 'What we are looking at is a cohort of kids who as they become adults may be less able to contribute to the growth of the economy. It could go on for multiple generations.' Poverty: Karla Washington, 41, an undergraduate student, has a five-year-old daughter but earns less than $11,000 from her part-time job . The annual survey monitored by policy makers across the nation concludes that children from low-income families are more likely to be raised in unstable environments and change schools than their wealthier peers. As a result, they are less likely to be gainfully employed as adults. There are other social costs. Economically disadvantaged children can result in reduced economic output, higher health expenditures and increased criminal justice costs for society, the survey concludes.

The research is based on data from many sources, including the Mortgage Bankers Association, National Delinquency Survey and U.S. Census Bureau. 'Even if you don't care about kids and all you care about is your own well-being, then you ought to be concerned,' said Patrick McCarthy, president of the Baltimore-based charity. 'We've got to think about what kind of state, what kind of country we can expect to have if we are not investing in the success of our children.' The report found some bright spots. In the two decades since researchers began compiling the annual report, infant mortalities, child and teen deaths and high school drop-out rates have declined. But the number of unhealthy babies have increased, and there were far more children living in low-income families. Programmes such as food stamps, unemployment insurance and foreclosure meditation have acted like a dam against the flood of poverty, McCarthy said, but that assistance has been threatened by federal and state government budget cuts. Mississippi kept its overall last place ranking in child welfare for the 10th consecutive year, according to the survey. It was closely trailed by neighbouring Louisiana and Alabama, a nod to the poverty that plagues southern states. Nevada ranked 40th overall, its worst ranking in 10 years, largely because of its economic decline. The rankings are determined by a state's achievement in 10 indicators that reflect child poverty, such as undernourished infants, infant mortalities, teen births and children in single-parent families. The top state for children was New Hampshire, ahead of Minnesota, Massachusetts and Vermont. In Mississippi, 31 per cent of children were living in poverty — the highest level in the U.S. New Hampshire had the smallest population of low-income children at 11 per cent. The federal poverty level this year is $22,350 a year for a family of four, but child advocates claim that figure should be higher. Nevada, Florida, Arizona and California and other states grappling with high foreclosures rates also were home to the largest populations of children affected by the mortgage crisis. North Dakota had the fewest, followed by South Dakota, Vermont, Wyoming and Alaska. In all, more than 5.3million children have been affected by foreclosure, the study found. Mississippi's rankings were least affected by the recession, only because it long ago secured its worst-case standing. Overall, Mississippi ranked last in seven of the survey's child well-being indicators. 'We are really tired of being in 50th place,' said Linda Southward, a social science research professor at Mississippi State University. Less than $21,756: Karla Washington is parent to one of the 14.7million children in poverty, as defined by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget . She said state policy makers have closely followed the rankings and have strived to promote early education as part of its strategy to reduce overall poverty. 'We are just extremely challenged given the economic hardships that we have,' she said. Nevada, meanwhile, has long had a difficult record on child issues because of its historically low-performing schools. The Kids Count survey found 11 per cent of Nevada teens were not in school and had not graduated from high school in 2009, the worst rate in the nation. New Hampshire was best at three per cent. At least 34 per cent of Nevada's children were living in families with both parents not working full-time in 2009, the largest increase in the nation, according to the survey.","14.7million children in families with income less than $21,756 a year .

"A 20-year-old woman who had a rare genetic disorder that kept her looking like a toddler has died. Brooke Greenberg remained physically and cognitively similar to a toddler, with an estimated mental age of nine months to one year. She died last week and her cause of death remains unknown. 20 years old: Despite her increasing age, Brooke remained physically and cognitively similar to a toddler, with an estimated mental age of nine months to one year. She died last week . Medical marvel: During her 20 years, Brooke (seen here at left with her younger sister Carly) overcame a number of health issues that were resolved without doctor's knowing what had happened . 'While the outside world may have noticed Brooke’s physical stature and been puzzled by her unique development state, she brought joy and love to her family,' Rabbi Andrew Busch said during his eulogy, according to The New York Daily News. 'Her parents, three sisters and extended family showered her with love and respected her dignity throughout her entire life.' In January of this year, Brooke and her family- including her 17-year-old sister- made an appearance on Katie Couric's talk show. They told how she is unable to talk, still has her baby teeth and like any infant, travels in a push chair - but doctors have never been able to explain why. Her father, Howard Greenberg, explained: 'From age one to four, Brooke changed. She got a little bit bigger. But age four, four to five, she stopped.' Family: Brooke, then 16, with her parents, her younger sister Carly, then 13 (second left) and their older sister Caitlin, then 19 (left). While her sisters developed normally, Brooke stayed the size of a toddler . Supportive family: Brooke appeared in January on Katie with her mother Melanie, father Howard and 17-year-old sister, Carly . She has been examined by some of the most prestigious medical institutions in the U.S., however no formal diagnosis for Brooke’s condition has been given, leading doctors to term her condition Syndrome X. Dr Eric Schadt, director of the Icahn Institute for Genomics and Multiscale Biology at The Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York, explained that she has 'no apparent abnormalities in her endocrine system, no gross chromosomal abnormalities, or any of the other disruptions known to occur in humans that can cause developmental issues.' Brooke stayed the same size for 15 years and required 24-hour care from her parents. She is fed through a tube inserted into her stomach, because her oesophagus is so small that swallowed food could back up into her lungs and cause pneumonia. Her mother, Melanie Greenberg, said: 'It's been 16 years of on the job training, giving her medicine, knowing when she's sick, knowing the right amount.' Sisterly love: Tests have shown that Brooke, who is three years older than her sister, may suffer from a gene mutation that switches off her ability to mature . Happy: The family said that they knew it was difficult for outsiders to understand Brooke- since even some of the world's best doctors didn't have a clue . Shopping trip: Brooke, who stopped growing at age four to five, stayed the same size for 15 years and  required 24-hour care from her parents . Mr Greenberg added: 'The key with Brooke is we don't know what tomorrow brings.' Scientists believe her unique genetic code could provide a fresh insight into the process of aging, leading to the development of new treatments for diseases related to old age, such as Parkinson's. Tests have shown that Brooke, who was born in 1993, may have suffered from a gene mutation that switches off her ability to mature. One of the factors that was the most difficult for doctors to diagnose was the fact that she had no obvious causes from a genetic standpoint. A leading genetics expert reported that there were 'no apparent abnormalities in her . endocrine system, no gross chromosomal abnormalities, or any of the . other disruptions known to occur in humans that can cause developmental . issues.' In spite of that, Brooke stayed the same size for 15 years. Much of the problem stemmed from the fact that different parts of her body were running out of sync from one another. 'Various . parts of her body, rather than all being at the same stage, seem to be . disconnected,' Dr. Richard Walker of the University of South Florida . College of Medicine said in 2009. When her condition was profiled by . Dateline when she was 8-years-old in 2001, she weighed about 13 pounds . which is standard for children at about six months old. She . stayed about the same weight for many years after that, but in 2009 Dr . Walker reported that she had the mental capacity of a 9-month-old child. Dr Schadt is in the process of sequencing Brooke’s genome, which is comprised of two long strings of letters, one from the mother and one from the father. Each string is three billion letters long, and changes in just one of these letters can lead to profound effects on development, physical appearance, and risk of disease. According to ABC News, in the first six years of her life, Brooke suffered series of medical emergencies from which she recovered, often without explanation. She survived surgery for seven . perforated stomach ulcers, and suffered a brain seizure followed by a . stroke that weeks later left no apparent damage. Then . at age four, she fell into a coma that caused her to sleep for 14 days. Doctors diagnosed a brain tumor, which disappeared by the time she . awoke. Dr Schadt hopes to . find out whether any abnormal genes identified in Brooke 'are involved . in aging related processes, whether manipulating these genes could . increase longevity and/or reduce aging related disorders such as . Alzheimer’s, heart disease and many forms of cancer,' he said. Mrs . Greenberg, who said during the Katie appearance that she loves Brooke . the way she is, explained that if another mother with a toddler asks her . how old Brooke is, she usually doesn't answer truthfully. 'My system always has been to turn years into months. So, if someone asked today, I might say, she's [20] months old,' she said. Many . doctors examined Brooke during her life, and one of the most shocking . discoveries was that none of her genomes were distinctly abnormal. Mother and daughter: Mrs Greenberg, who said she loved Brooke the way she was, explained that if another mother with a toddler asks her how old Brooke is, she usually doesn't answer truthfully . Key to aging: Scientists believe Brooke's unique genetic code could provide a fresh insight into the process of ageing, leading to the development of new treatments for diseases related to old age, such as Parkinson's . Instead, much of the problem stemmed from the fact that different parts of her body were running out of sync from one another. 'Various parts of her body, rather than all being at the same stage, seem to be disconnected,' Dr. Richard Walker of the University of South Florida College of Medicine said in 2009. One of the clearest examples of this is based on the fact that her brain was believed to have developed past different parts of her body. When her condition was profiled by Dateline when she was 8-years-old in 2001, she weighed about 13 pounds which is standard for children at about six months old. She stayed about the same weight for many years after that, but in 2009 Dr Walker reported that she had the mental capacity of a 9-month-old child. Brooke's case, while extremely rare, is not believed to be the only one of it's kind. There are two other clear examples of individuals with very similar situations, though none of them have been categorically solved.","Brooke remained physically and cognitively similar to a toddler in spite of being born in 1993 .

"The Missouri church attended by Michael Brown’s father and his family was one of a dozen or so buildings burned to the ground during Monday night’s protests in the wake of a grand jury’s decision not to indict Officer Darren Wilson. While the majority of the buildings destroyed on Monday were in downtown Ferguson, the Flood Christian Church is located some three miles away from the protests in a remote section of Country Club Hills. Pastor Carlton Lee, who has been a vocal advocate for the Browns since their son was shot in August, has said he believes that white supremacists rather than protesters were to blame for the destruction. What's more, this all happened just one day after Michael Brown Sr. was baptized, attending a service at Flood Christian Church and then undergoing the actual religious rite at the nearby West Calvary Mission Baptist Church. Scroll down for video . Flood Christian Church, the church attended by Michael Brown’s father and his family, was one of a dozen or so buildings burned to the ground (above) during Monday night’s protests in Ferguson . The church was destroyed just one day after his baptism at the nearby West Calvary Mission Baptist Church (above) Pastor Carlton Lee, who has been a vocal advocate for the Browns since their son was shot in August, has said he believes white supremacists rather than protesters were to blame for the destruction . Brown was joined by his wife, Cal, and their children for his baptism on Sunday. 'It's just been so much stuff going on, we haven't had a chance to do it,' said Michael Sr. 'After all the stuff that's been happening, we have to keep doing positive things...it's just something we needed to do for our family.' Rev. Lee told NBC News that he believes Flood church was targeted because he has repeatedly called for the arrest of Officer Wilson. 'I'm very vocal in regards to the Michael Brown case,' said Lee, who has participated in rallies and press conferences with Michael Brown Sr. and claims to have received 71 death threats. 'The police called me and told me the church was on fire,' Lee said. 'I was in complete disbelief. I didn't think anyone would set a church on fire. 'I feel like one of my children has died. I put my blood, my sweat, my tears into this church, getting this church built from the ground up. 'To see that it was taken down in a few minutes is really heartbreaking.' Rev. Lee said Michael Brown Sr. was 'just devastated again' about the extensive damage. He then brought up how close it happened to Brown Sr.'s baptism.

"She may have been working in the industry for nearly 30 years, but Naomi Campbell is still one of the world's most in-demand models. Despite her unprecedented success - she's worked for every major fashion house -  Naomi, 44, admits that the industry, which is so often perceived as glamorous, can be really lonely. Speaking to Look magazine, the supermodel said: 'No one tells you how lonely it can be. You're travelling alone constantly and it can play on your psyche. 'It's important to stay as strong as you can and to have good friends or family to lean on.' Stellar success: Naomi Campbell has worked for every major fashion house and is using her power and influence to raise funds for Ebola with the launch of a pop-up fashion shop . Luckily for Naomi, she's been able to share the experience with her 'fashion family' - a starry host of models, designers and photographers, who have helped nurture her along the way. 'I definitely spent more time around them than around my own blood family as I was traveling and working so much… Azzedine [Alaïa] is more like a papa; Gianni [Versace] was more like a brother,' she recently told Net-a-Porter's The Edit. As one of the 90’s supers, which also included Cindy Crawford, Kate Moss, Linda Evangelista and Christy Turlington, Campbell’s life has rocked and rolled between extremes but she is, above all, a survivor. Charitable: In response to the current Ebola threat, she has launched the Fashion For Relief Campaign, in partnership with Westfield London - a pop-up shop selling designer clothes for the cause . 'I don’t have to justify myself to anyone. I took off almost five years from work,' she said. 'But I’m a Gemini and I like to keep moving and doing things and being there for friends. If I go against my instincts, there is always a consequence.' And one special man has helped her along the way - and now she wants to help others. '[Nelson] Mandela always said to me: ""Use yourself to help other people."" 'I feel that now more strongly than ever before and I try to do that in the best way I can,' she said. She is certainly doing just that - she's raised millions for causes including Hurricane Katrina and the Haiti earthquake. In response to the current Ebola threat, she has launched the Fashion For Relief Campaign, in partnership with Westfield London. Famous friends: Naomi and Kate, pictured in 1999, have been friends for years and Kate is donating one of her outfits to the charitable cause . The star is launching a one-week pop-up store opening to the public in The Village on November 28 as part of Westfield’s big Shopping weekend.

"'I lost my bearings': Vladimir Martynenko, whose snow plough clipped the wheel of a private jet taking off in Moscow on Monday, causing it to crash . The driver of the snowplough in the Moscow plane crash which killed French oilman Christophe de Margerie and three crew has admitted straying onto the runway after losing his bearings. Vladimir Martynenko's lawyer also acknowledged the 60-year-old may have consumed a 'remedy' which included 'a few drops' of alcohol after yesterday angrily denying official claims his client was 'drunk'. In video testimony, the grey haired driver stated: 'When I lost my bearings, I myself didn't notice when I drove onto the runway.' Mr de Margerie, the 63-year-old boss of French oil giant Total, was killed alongside the three crew of his Falcon business jet when the aircraft exploded into a fireball at Vnukovo Airport. It was also revealed today that a 'girl trainee' air traffic controller gave the signal to the doomed business jet that it was clear to take off - moments before it hit Martynenko's snowplough. The unnamed controller was being supervised at the time by a senior colleague called Alexander Kruglov, said a source at Vnukovo airport. Kruglov, 40, is an experienced air traffic controller who famously averted a serious crash in 2007 by halting a Tu-204 takeoff when he noticed flames coming from the plane. The revelations came amid suspicions of an official campaign to gag Martynenkov's lawyer and family - who deny he was 'drunk' at the time of the crash - from highlighting alleged blunders by airport controllers. In particular, his lawyer argued that the controller should have seen that his vehicle was on the runway when the Falcon was permitted to start its takeoff, but other disturbing claims have also come to light. Martynenko is expected to face a Moscow court today when a judge will be asked to approve his formal arrest. 'The plane was running up to takeoff and I practically couldn't see it because my equipment was on. There weren't even any lights, nothing,' he said, with a shrug. 'I didn't see it, and the collision happened.' It was not clear if he meant the lights on the runway or the plane or on his vehicle. The crash was at several minutes before midnight on Monday. A report by newspaper Izvestia appeared to confirm speculation that an inexperienced air traffic controller was involved. 'The aircraft's actions were really run by girl trainee,' said a source at Vnukovo airport. 'The instructor actually controls all the actions of the trainee,' and can intervene at any time. 'In addition, there is also a flight director who supervises the work of air traffic controllers,' said the unnamed source. 'However, in the case of the Falcon crashed at Vnukovo air traffic controllers were not able to do anything.' Another insider said: 'No one could see the vehicle. There was strong fog.' But this source complained the 'quality of display equipment' was 'very poor'. 'As a result, when the vehicle moved out onto the runway unauthorised, it was not seen.' The snowplough driver was supposed to listen to radio communications between the tower and plane and 'had to hear' if a plane was given the go-ahead to takeoff, it was claimed. Fellow workers at Vnukovo have disputed the claim Martynenko was drunk, but there was a suggestion today that he consumed 'coffee with liquor' shortly before the crash. Investigators warned that senior officials at the airport bore ultimate responsibility for errors by ground staff, arguing 'criminal negligence' was involved. Christophe de Margerie, right, with his wife: Mr de Margerie, CEO of Total, was returning to Paris after meeting Russian prime minister Dmitry Medvedev in Moscow. He and three crew members were killed in the crash . Experts were today obtaining information from the plane's black boxes. 'The information extracted from cockpit voice recorder will be sent for transcription and voice identification. The data from flight data recorder will be deciphered and submitted to technical experts,' said Sergei Zaiko, deputy chairman of the Moscow-based Interstate Aviation Committee (MAK). Meanwhile, lawyers for Martynenko claimed that their attempts to hold a press conference have been stonewalled by a number of pro-Kremlin media organisations. A report by Ekho Moscow radio said: 'A news conference by Martynenkov's lawyer and his wife and son was scheduled to take place at the offices of the Argumenty i Fakty weekly. 'However, it was cancelled for technical reasons without any details given, says RBK [business daily]. 'No agreement could be reached with Moskovskiy Komsomolets [daily] either, the lawyer representing the snowplough driver told Ekho Moscow. 'Requests were sent to a couple of other places: at first they agreed, but then called back and refused.' Wreckage: The remnants of Mr de Margerie's Dassault Falcon jet. Investigators warned that senior officials at the airport bore ultimate responsibility for errors by ground staff, arguing 'criminal negligence' was involved . Alexander Karabanov, Martynenko's lawyer, later told the station he has not been given the name of the air-traffic controller on duty. He also claimed that he was denied access to his client soon after the crash. He fears that in the 20 hours Martynenko spent in custody alone he was forced to sign documents without his lawyer present. 'I realise that right now we are in situation of conflict of interest between the airport and the driver, because if the investigation finds out that the fault was on the airport's air traffic controller, there is the prospect of millions worth of legal actions,' he said. 'My client is a very convenient figure from this point of view. If he is found guilty the threat of legal actions and losses is far smaller. We understand we will be fighting company with huge administrative and financial resources.' He claimed a subtle change has been made in the name of the company employing Martynenko in a possible bid to distance it from the airport. Until yesterday it was called called ZAO 'Aeroservice'. Today it is known as OOO 'Aero-service'. The first is a closed joint stock company, the second is a public corporation. 'On other strange moments in this investigation, we still don't have name of chief engineer whose duty was to look after snow ploughing brigade,' he said. 'Martynenko is just an ordinary driver, he had no access to overall picture of what's been happening at the airport at that point.' 'He is in a state of shock, even though visually there is not a single scratch on him. I have requested medical check up to see if he might have brain concussion or internal damages. 'He can't put together his actions with what happened... 'I don't understand what happened, I was following my route', he keeps saying.' Mr Karabanov earlier told Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper: 'We still have not seen the documents on the medical examination of Martynenko. 'I can imagine that they do not exist. Probably, the investigators could conclude that there was 'intoxication', based on Vladimir's diction and behaviour and reported it to their superiors. 'But the man was in shock. He was almost killed.' Alexander Karabanov, Martynenko's lawyer: He said he believes there was no medical carried out on his client that could definitively prove he was drunk . Mr Karabanov added: 'Vladimir is a simple man. He is the most basic technical performer. He has no understanding of what is happening in the air and on the ground. 'Even if we assume that Martynenko was lost in the fog, he did not go there of his own initiative. 'He was sent by people who should have known that the Falcon was preparing for take-off. 'There are internal rules, according to which the air traffic controller has full responsibility for everything that happens in the air and on the ground. 'Even if we assume that Martynenko lost landmarks as a result of weather conditions, it is the dispatcher who had to control him, direct his routes.' Martynenko's son, Roman, said: 'My father never complained. It's his job. He does not do any dirty tricks. Just worked honestly, and that's all. 'He served in the army, worked as a driver, a crane operator. For a while, he led a garage cooperative. And this work in Vnukovo - in fact he was paid very little there. 'But it was important to him - to do something, to work. Just not to sit at home. He and my mother still do not want to retire.' Respected political analyst and editor Yevgenia Albats said today that the crash could signal the 'beginning of collapse' for Vladimir Putin's system of government. 'How could it happen that a snowplough was on the runway? How could it happen that the plane was allowed to go along the runway and hit this snowplough? It is very symbolic,' she said. Such 'chaos' will stop business from coming to Russia, she warned. 'They can't get rid of the chaos here. Chaos on the runway. 'It is such a symbolic thing that I strongly feel it is the beginning of collapse.'","Vladimir Martynenko's lawyer also says his client may have drunk 'remedy'

"After winning Wimbledon last summer, there was really only one ‘will he/won’t he’ question Andy Murray had left to answer. And it was a resounding ‘yes, he will’ as the tennis star finally became engaged to his girlfriend – nine years after they first met. He proposed to Kim Sears, 26, last week with a diamond ring he chose himself and she immediately said ‘yes’. Scroll down for video . Engaged at last: Tennis star Andy Murray has proposed to Kim Sears, his partner of more than nine years . Look of love: Left, a candid moment between the pair, and right, after winning Olympic gold in 2012 . Sources said the couple had hoped to keep their engagement secret for some time and have not yet made plans for their wedding. Murray, 27, who flew to the Philippines for a tennis tournament yesterday, had not even shared his happy news with some of his closest family members. The sportsman’s mother Judy said last night that she was ‘thrilled’, but his grandmother said she had heard only ‘rumours’. Since last year becoming the first British man to win the Wimbledon singles title since 1936, Murray has repeatedly batted off questions about when he would ask Miss Sears to marry him. But he popped the question last Wednesday, placing a painstakingly selected engagement ring on her finger. Miss Sears was just 17 and still studying her A-Levels when she met the up-and-coming tennis player at the US Open in 2005. Murray wooed her with phone calls and flowers. But she did not allow their burgeoning romance to affect her schoolwork, and she achieved straight As in her exams. The couple managed to keep their relationship quiet – until Murray won his first tournament in California in 2006 and ran through the crowd to give his girlfriend a kiss. They separated briefly in 2009, reportedly because of the sports star’s video games obsession, but rekindled their romance after six months and have stayed together since. She has been credited with improving the tennis player’s scruffy appearance and helping him to control his fiery temper on court.

Kiss for a champion: Kim Sears reacts at the men's final at Wimbledon in July 2013 . Murray, who grew up in Dunblane in Scotland, has spoken of the strength he draws from Miss Sears, particularly in the light of his own parents’ separation when he was just 11. ‘I work better in a relationship. At the end of a day, especially if I’ve lost a match, I don’t like talking about tennis, so it’s nice to have someone to talk to about other stuff,’ he said in 2009. The couple live in a £5.6million house in Oxshott, Surrey, with their two Border terriers, Rusty and Maggie May. There had been a series of rumours that Murray was about to propose to Miss Sears before their engagement was officially confirmed yesterday. In January he jokingly tweeted: ‘We are getting married just after Wimbledon, should be a great day.’ The message prompted Twitter users to offer their congratulations, until he admitted that it was just ‘tongue-in-cheek’. Murray has already spoken of how he would like to have children with Miss Sears. Domesticity: The pair pop out to do some shopping in 2010 .

It’s something that I’m starting to think about because Kim and I have been together for eight years.’ Last night Mrs Murray, 55, who was recently voted off Strictly Come Dancing, said simply: ‘I’m thrilled.’ The sports star’s grandmother Shirley Erskine added: ‘I know there have been rumours but that’s as much as we know. It would be nice, without a doubt.’ A spokesman for Murray confirmed that the star had become engaged but declined to give any further details.

"It sounds like something from a science fiction film, but a pill to counter the ageing process could become a reality. Scientists in Russia are testing a new formula, which they claim can delay the start of the ageing process. They hope the tablet, which is being tested on rats, mice, fish and dogs, will allow people to live to at least 120. Scroll down for video . Scientists are working on a pill to counter ageing that would allow people to live to 120. They are testing a new formula on rats, mice, fish and dogs, which they claim can delay the ageing process . Researcher Dr Maxim Skulachev, from the Moscow State University project, said: 'A lot of aging diseases developed much slower.' The scientists are using a 'new type of antioxidant', which they hope will impact on on the mitochondria, the energy-producing part of cells, which is seen as triggering ageing. 'The mitochondria are to be blamed for heart attacks, they are linked to diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's,' he said. Dr Maxim Skulachev, from the Moscow State University said if successful, ''t will be possible to postpone old age' He pointed to the naked mole-rat of east Africa renowned for longevity and evidently immune to cancer. A realistic goal was to aim for a life span for humans of 120, and anti-ageing medication was 'technically possible', he told Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper. 'I don't believe we will be able to live to 800,' he said. 'Most probably, some new disease will emerge, let's say, a typical disease for a 120-year-old. 'That was the case with cancer, which was a rare disease when ancient people died much younger.' The Russian tests have not led to an significant life span increase, but delayed the onset of ageing, he said. 'If it turns out that diseases develop more slowly, our idea to fight aging through mitochondria is the right one, added Dr Skulachev, who has been working to perfect his treatment for decades. 'It will be possible to postpone old age.'","Russian scientists have tested a new formula on rats, mice, fish and dogs .

"Katie Hopkins has sparked controversy once more by saying police officer Darren Wilson should 'get a medal' for shooting unarmed black teenager Michael Brown who she called 'a thief and a thug'. The never-ending source of opinions took to Twitter to give her two cents on the Ferguson case after a grand jury decided not to indict officer Wilson over the killing. Unsurprisingly, the reactions to Ms Hopkins' comments, posted to her 263,000 followers yesterday, did not take long. Scroll down for video . Controversial: Katie Hopkins tweeted her support for police officer Darren Wilson for shooting Michael Brown, calling the dead 18-year-old 'a thief and a thug' 'Brown was not shot for being black. Brown was shot for being a thief and a thug. Give the officer a medal. Justice with knobs on,' Ms Hopkins wrote. In response, several Twitter users accused Ms Hopkins of 'attention seeking', 'antagonizing', and trying too hard'. Ms Hopkins, whose post has been favourited 306 times and had 264 retweets so far, is not the first person to tweet her opinion on the controversial case. When the decision was announced on Monday, 3.5million tweets were posted about the ruling using #Ferguson in just a few hours. When St. Louis County Prosecutor Bob McCullough announced the grand jury's conclusion that 'no probable cause exists' to indict Officer Darren Wilson at 8.30pm CT, around 52,200 tweets per minute were posted. Tragic death: Michael Brown was unarmed when he was shot and killed by police officer Derren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri in August this year .

Ongoing protests: Demonstrators in Washington DC march in the streets to protest the Missouri grand jury's decision not to indict Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson over the shooting of Michael Brown . Earlier today, Officer Darren Wilson revealed that he believes he made the right choice to use lethal force against Michael Brown. Wilson said that while he feels remorse for causing Brown's death, he would do it all over again. 'I don't think it's haunting; it's always going to be something that happened,'  the controversial cop said during an interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos . 'The reason I have a clear conscience is because I know I did my job right,' Wilson said. Michael Brown's family reacted with anger on Wednesday, saying Wilson's interview added 'insult to injury'. The teenager's mother, Lesley McSpadden, told CBS she didn't think Wilson wanted to kill Michael but that 'he wanted to kill someone'. Despite the St. Louis grand jury decision, federal investigations into the shooting of Michael Brown continue the US Attorney General Eric Holder said on Monday. The Justice Department will continue to pursue two investigations, one into potential civil rights violations by Officer Wilson when he shot dead unarmed Brown in August this year, and one into the practices of the Ferguson Police force.","Katie Hopkins tweeted Darren Wilson 'should get a medal' for killing .

"WalMart will have to pay for hundreds of thousands of dollars of groceries bought by Louisiana food stamp recipients after a computer glitch gave them unlimited funds on their government-issued credit cards. The Louisiana Department of Children and . Family Services, which oversees the Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) card program in the state, said . WalMart could have instituted an emergency $50 limit for each customer, . but chose not to - and as a result, the retail giant must foot the sizable bill. It comes after dozens of welfare families with EBT cards picked the shelves bare in stores in Springhill and Mansfield on Saturday and walked away with up to ten shopping carts filled with meat and other groceries - in a spending frenzy described by local officials as 'worse than Black Friday'. Scroll down for video . At 9 p.m. when cards started working again, customers left their carts sprawled out all over the store . Emergency Benefits Transaction cards (EBT) have designated amounts of funds that under-financed individuals can use to buy food each month . When Walmart employees noticed EBT cards weren’t showing spending . limits, they called the corporate office and were advised to allow shoppers to . use the cards anyway. Other stores in the towns . temporarily closed or stopped accepting EBT cards. Wal-Mart instead . called in police to help control the chaotic crowds of shoppers who . flooded the store. 'It was definitely worse . than Black Friday. It was worse than anything we had ever seen in this . town. There was no food left on any of the shelves, and no meat left. The grocery part of Walmart was totally decimated,' Springhill Police . Chief Will Lyn told ABC News. Word spread across the towns about the loophole and hundreds of families flocked to the two Walmart stories. Chief Lyn said he saw some families ring up bills up more than $700. The average monthly food stamp allotment in Louisiana is $136 per person. 'I saw people drag out 8 to 10 grocery carts,' Lyn said. An entire line of full food carts were left unattended after food stamps went back online on Saturday night . WalMart stands by its decision to let families take advantage of the loophole. A spokeswoman said whatever money the company lost from the spending sprees won't have animpact on the corporate bottom line. 'We did make the decision to continue to accept EBT cards . during the outage so that they could get food for their families,’  Walmart representative Kayla Whaling told KSLA. The . lack of card limits was due to a power outage during a routine . maintenance test by Xerox, an EBT vendor. EBT cards contain . government-funded amounts of money catered to each individual's . financial needs. There were no arrests made that night and witnesses told KSLA that the incident was a 'natural human' response to free food. One EBT Card carrying woman takes advantage of the glitch by stocking up on her favorite apple juice . Walmart shelves in Springhill, Mansfield were cleared in an EBT glitch and stores were forced to stop selling food . From 7 p.m. to 9 p.m., a frenzy of shoppers filled their carts to the brim with as much food as they could get their hands on. When the cards came back online at 9 p.m., people abandoned their carts full of food in the middle of the Walmart and left as they didn't have the money to pay. One woman who tried to ring up $700 worth of food only had .49 cents on her card. She was held by police for ‘stealing’ but was let go on the condition that she would give the food back to Walmart. After the stampede Walmart had to stop selling food at 9 p.m. Their shelves were stark and both empty and full carts were left all over the store. A spokesman for Walmart told KSLA that the company continued selling to shoppers 'so that they could get food for their families.' When asked by KSLA whether or not Walmart would somehow be refunded for the loss of produce, Walmart representative Kayla Whaling responded that they were, ‘fully engaged and monitoring the situation and transactions during the outage.’","Saturday night some food stamp recipients in Louisiana had unlimited funds for several hours because of a glitch with Xerox .

"A millionaire Manhattan investor who dumped his girlfriend of five years by slapping her with a restraining order says he had no choice: when he tried doing it face-to-face, they always had makeup sex. 'I attempted to break up several times and somehow was convinced not to,' hedge funder Brad Zipper said on the witness stand Tuesday as he glared at his brunette ex, 28-year-old Nicole Raef. Nicole Raef, 28, was handed an order of protection upon returning to her boyfriend's home in the Hamptons after a girls weekend in California. Happier times? Brad Zipper dumped his girlfriend of 5 years using a restraining order she said was totally unexpected . End of an era: 28-year-old Nicole Raef (left) got dumped by her boyfriend Brad Zipper (right) with a restraining order . Zipper said Tuesday that he'd shared a bed with Raef just days before filing for the restraining order, reports the New York Post. 'I laid in the same bed with her at some point [on September 5],' he told the Manhattan family court. He went on to claim he couldn't recall whether he and Raef had sex that day. Raef, however, said she remembered clearly. 'We did,' Raef said on the stand. 'We slept in until 12:30 p.m. We kind of just cuddled and laid in bed and had the TV on. I don’t think we were really watching anything, though.' And while she claims the restraining order took her completely by surprise, Zipper is telling a much different story. 'I was 100 percent shocked,' Raef told the New York Post. “ . 'I was like, ""I don’t understand, who breaks up with someone this way?""' Nowhere to live: Raef was forced to move out of the Hamptons home and NYC townhouse (above) she shared with Raef . What's worse, having been kicked out of Zipper's Hamptons home and his $4million NYC townhouse, which is located in the city's Little Italy neighborhood, Raef had nowhere to live and even had to resort to pawning her diamond earrings so she could afford a lawyer. Raef also said that while the two had been arguing before she left, they had worked things out. Zipper, in papers he filed, paints Raef in a much different light, and implies their relationship was incredibly tumultuous and at times even abusive. He recalls one incident in which he returned home to find his oven on fire and Raef passed out in the guest room. 'When she woke up, she was delirious and didn’t even remember driving and getting into an accident with my car that night,' he says in the suit. Crazy?: In court filings, Zipper says his relationship with Raef (above) was tumultuous, and that she once threw wine bottles at his head . Her also claims Raef, who works in the fashion industry, threw wine bottles at his head during a party over the summer, and tossed thousands of dollars worth of his possessions into the pool at his South Hampton home. Raef’s attorney, Brett Kimmel, has denied all of Zipper's claims. 'This is a wealthy man breaking up with his girlfriend and doing it in a really untasteful way,' said Kimmel. Prior to the break up, the two enjoyed a jet set life, traveling around the country and even being featured in the New York Times. That story detailed one of the couple's nights out, having dinner with his parents in the city.","Nicole Raef, 28, was dumped by Brad Zipper when she was handed an order of protection following a weekend away .

"Relatives of a deceased Washington state man were appalled at his funeral on Monday when they opened the casket to say their last goodbyes and discovered another man's body. Making the troubling find even more heartbreaking, the man who was in the casket had a plastic bag over his head. The mix-up appears to have happened when Brown Mortuary in Longview - about 80 miles north of Portland, Oregon - took possession of Jerry Moon's body after his death. Dead wrong: Jerry Moon's family was aghast when the found another man's body in their father's coffin . Around that same time, the mortuary also took possession of the body of a 97-year-old man who died in hospice care. Somehow, the bodies were mixed up. 'This makes me feel like he was treated as a number, not a person,' daughter Cheryl Moon told KIROTV.com. According to family members, Moon's funeral was a touching goodbye to the man they loved. At the end of the service, they opened the casket. Oops: It's believed the Brown Mortuary mistakenly put the body of a 97-year-old man in Moon's coffin . 'I turned around and said to myself three times, '‘That’s not him, that’s not him, that’s not him,'” son Randy Moon told the station. Inside the casket was the other man - dressed in Jerry Moon's clothes and with a picture of Moon's wife tucked under the pillow in the coffin. Making things even worse, Moon was terrified of being cremated. But because of the mix-up, the funeral home cremated his body thinking it was that of the other man. Brown Mortuary said were directed by their parent company, Houston-based Service Corporation International, not to comment on the case. Grieving: Moon's son Randy says he believes his father is in Heaven, regardless of who was in the casket . SCI runs roughly 1,400 funeral homes in the U.S. and Canada, as well as 400 cemetaries. The only other thing I can say is we know where he really is,' Randy Moon said.

"Holy Safari: OJ Simpson wants to host a television show as he travels the world interviewing religious ideologues and luminaries such as the Pope . OJ Simpson’s religious rebirth behind bars has seen him counsel fellow inmates and convert a white supremacist to Christianity – and now he wants to take his show on the road for television. Simpson, 66, has always been religious, but his five years behind bars have given him time to focus on religion and have brought him closer to God, MailOnline has learned. Expecting to be out of prison by Christmas, he plans to host a tv show called ‘Holy Safari,’ according to his promoter. The former NFL great now spends his time reading multiple versions of the Bible, even the Quran, and giving advice to and converting fellow inmates, promoter Norman Pardo told MailOnline before comparing ‘The Juice’ to a prophet. Originally reported by the National Enquirer, Mr Simpson has become very religious behind bars. As a decision on the appeal of his armed robbery and kidnapping convictions nears, the groundwork is being laid for a return to the spotlight. ‘He’s always been religious inside of the prison,’ Mr Pardo said. ‘He helps people who can’t find their way.’ One of those people was a cellmate of OJ’s the first year he was locked up, Mr Pardo boasted. A white supremacist, Mr Simpson was able to convert the man to Christianity, one of many converts during ‘The Juice’s time in the pokey. A message left with a Nevada Department of Corrections spokesperson seeking comment on Mr Simpson’s religious activities behind bars was not immediately returned. The footballer’s awakening hasn’t happened since he was in prison, he has always been religious according to Mr Pardo. The promoter said he has known Mr Simpson since the late 1990s. Upbeat: O.J. Simpson (R) smiles at the end of an evidentiary hearing in Clark County District Court on May 17 . ‘Most people just think of him as a murderer because they don’t know the other side,’ he added. ‘Holy Safari,’ a television show in development that was weeks commencing production before Mr Simpson was sent to the slammer, is Mr Simpson’s likely destination, Mr Pardo said. The gregarious promoter kept in touch with the Hall of Famer while he was in prison, even visiting a few times. Initially slated to go on a now-defunct television station, the show will feature OJ traveling the world exploring local ideologies and interviewing religious leaders – including the Pope, according to Mr Pardo. The promoter even insists that religious people are behind the project. ‘There’s a lot of religious people who are behind this,’ he said. ‘They feel if OJ found the lord, it’s important.’ Out by Christmas: Mr Pardo and Mr Simpson's attorneys are confident he will be out in time to celebrate the holiday . Despite what will likely be a negative reaction to putting the former Buffalo Bills running back on television, Mr Pardo insists Mr Simpson is the best man for the job. ‘Most all networks need ratings, and OJ is the hottest rated thing you’re gonna get,’ he boasted. Comparing Mr Simpson to Job, Mr Pardo said the footballer is the best person for the message of God. ‘This man has had everyone taken from him… this is the man that can be the evangelist.’ ‘Nobody could have been through as much as him and kept their faith,’ Mr Pardo continued. Characterized by Ozzie Fumo, an attorney for Mr Simpson, as a 'hanger-on' trying to profit off OJ's name, Mr Pardo countered that he has never made a cent off the former NFL star in the 20 years he has known him. 'I have nothing to gain, I’ve never made a dollar off OJ,' said Mr Pardo. 'When I took OJ on tour, I paid all the bills for all the limos and all that.' 'I could tell you more about OJ Simpson than those attorneys would ever know,' Mr Pardo continued. 'I spent 20 years with him in limos, on buses, at his home, him at my home - I even went to graduations.' No networks have expressed interest in the show as of yet, but Mr Pardo chalks that up to the reformed running back still being behind bars. He insists that OJ Simpson going to jail is actually an advantage in pitching the the project to networks. ‘It’d have to be the guy on the bottom, and you can’t get much farther from the bottom than OJ right now.’","Hall of Fame great OJ Simpson's show will be called Holy Safari .

"A fox has become the latest victims to the freezing temperatures on Scandinavia's waters as it was found frozen solid in a lake in southern Sweden. The animal was discovered by a skater on Lake Bunn, near Jönköping, who originally thought it was a piece of foam rubber, but found the poor fox dead in the ice with its head just above the surface. It follows recent 'animal ice deaths' in Scandinavia, where an entire shoal of fish were photographed off the coast of Norway just days after a moose had suffered the same fate. Not saying much now: The fox was found frozen solid in the ice on a lake in southern Sweden . Jeffer Sandström, 26, said: ‘From what I could see the ice had obviously cracked and the fox had fallen through the hole. Unable to get out after scrabbling around it must have tried to swim under the ice in a last-ditch effort to save itself and then probably suffocated.’ He said: ‘I'd been unsure myself as to whether skating on a lake here in Jönköping was a good idea. ‘Temperatures had been below zero for several days though, so in the end I figured it was strong enough for a skate. I guessed the ice was likely between three and five centimetres thick.’ ‘I skated fairly close by and saw it out of the corner of my eye and thought someone had thrown foam rubber of something into the water, and then I saw it was a fox,' Jeffer told Aftonbladet. 'It was totally frozen, the whiskers were sticking up above the surface.' Well and truly iced: It is likely that the fox fell through thin ice and unable to get back out, froze to death as temperatures sunk overnight . On thin ice: Skater Jeffer Sandström decided to return home after he saw that the fox had gone through the frozen surface . Cold shoulder:When Mr Sandstrom found the fox on Lake Bunn, near Jönköping, he originally thought it was a piece of foam rubber . He added: ‘I'd never seen anything like it before. I must admit I felt really sorry for the fox, but not for long, because I felt if it can happen to the fox, I might be next.’ ‘I just thought “Whoops, it's time to go home”.’ The is is not the first time animals have been caught out by freezing temperatures in Scandinavian waters. Last week an entire shoal of fish was found frozen mid-swim off the coast of Norway, near the northern island of Lovund. Earlier in the winter, a moose was found frozen solid after falling through the icy surface of a Norwegian lake, found half visible above the ice. It appears as though it was trying to cross the ice, when it cracked, trapping the moose in the freezing water.

"She is considered British acting royalty, still in hot demand with a raft of film and television awards under her belt, but Julie Walters is determined to age gracefully despite the pressures of the industry. Looking ravishing on the cover of the Good Housekeeping January issue the 64-year-old reveals her horror at the American culture of plastic surgery. In an exclusive interview she says: 'I can't imagine living there! It's the facelifts and the whole attitude to women. Everyone who lives there says you have to have a facelift. And everyone has had them… Everyone. As people get older, they do this half-facelift stuff so they can pretend they haven't had them! I think: don't do it – be beautiful anyway. Scroll down for video . 64-old-actress Julie Walters has revealed that she hates the prominence of facelifts in American and says women shouldn't be pressured to have them and 'be beautiful anyway' 'If everybody had facelifts, there would be no one to play the old people! You see some American programmes and think: ""Oh my god is that supposed to be her mother? I thought she was meant to be her sister? Oh please! Have some real faces!"" 'The only thing I don't like about ageing is possibly becoming infirm. I don't mind the face looking older. That's just the way it is.' Julie, who has been married to husband Grant Roffey for 14 years, also tells Good Housekeeping about keeping romance alive with love notes. Julie reveals that husband Grant still buys her flowers every week and still leave love notes for each other . The British treasure says that what makes her happy will always be knowing her family is okay 'knowing I've done a good days work' 'We can be romantic… Not soppy, though! We always leave notes for one another if I get in late or he has to get up early. And he brings me flowers every week. Sometimes I will leave a little note on his pillow if I'm going away. But even when I'm home we leave each other notes. 'Love is the most important thing to me in my life. It really is what makes the world go round,' she says. The couple, who have a daughter Maisie together, moved to a farm in Sussex several years ago, which Grant runs. 'I had always fantasised about living in the country. Once I became an actor, I wanted to be with someone who had nothing to do with the business. Read the full Julie Walters interview in the January 2015 issue of Good Housekeeping . 'It's a big escape. London is fabulous and I wouldn't want to be too far away from it. But it means work to me. To be in the middle of the woods is just lovely. 'It has its tough side as it is hard work – for Grant! We've got cattle, sheep, pigs and chickens.' But despite her love of rural life and escapism, Julie, who stars in the hotly anticipated new Paddington movie, has no plans to retire and time soon. 'I never want to stop, unless I'm not well enough. I would love to go back to the National Theatre at some point. I only like to do things that interest me. 'I turn down quite a few things, but I've never regretted that. I always think it's great for the actor who did it and they're much better than I would have been.' Ultimately the British treasure says that what makes her happy will always be knowing her family is okay 'knowing I've done a good days work.' 'I'm one of those people who has to feel like I've achieved something in the day. I hate those days where you feel you've done nothing. Those days where I think: should I do this?, I haven't done anything… Oh b@gger. I hate that.'

"It is common knowledge that illicit drugs are bad for your health, but a new series of GIFs show the devastating toll that controlled substances take on people battling addiction. The GIFs are part of a project titled Faces of Addiction, which has been put together by Rehabs.com - an educational organization dedicated to raising awareness of substance abuse. Unlike the more common before/after photos, these GIFs allow the viewer to follow the gradual physical decline of more than a dozen men and women. Scroll down for video . Startling change: In 1997, this woman was arrested for possession of methamphetamine (left). In 2013, she was photographed for another mugshot looking much older than her 59 years . The project includes 13 unnamed individuals who have been arrested over the years on various drug charges involving methamphetamine, cocaine, heroin or pain pills. 'The pursuit of a drug habit can cost these people everything – their friends and family, their home and livelihood. And nowhere is that impact more evident than in the faces of addicts themselves,' states the website. The shocking effects of drug abuse on display here run the gamut from open sores and skin lesions to missing teeth to severe facial wasting heralding premature aging. The statement posted on the site points out that beyond the direct effects of substance abuse, people suffering from addiction often fall into a ruinous pattern of self-neglect because taking care of one’s health and appearance becomes secondary to obtaining drugs at any cost. Ravaged: The 'before' booking photo taken in 2009 (left) shows a heavyset, ruddy man with a beard. Five years later, his toothless mouth like a crumpled origami and his lined are cheeks sallow and sunken . 'The consequences of addiction can remain etched in their very skin for years,' the project states. One of the GIFs focuses on a woman who begins her journey down the path of drug addiction in 2004 as a relatively fresh-faced 33-year-old. A decade later, she emerges as a withered, prematurely aged 43-year-old with a glass eye and sores on her forehead. Striking: This 43-year-old woman was arrested on a charge of drug paraphernalia possession. Ten years later, she has a glass eye and sores on her bedraggled face . Blink of an eye: This is what happened to a 23-year-old pain pill addict over the course of a single year . It is hard to believe that this woman arrested on a drug paraphernalia charge is only 31 years old . Empty shell: A 32-year-old man arrested for selling methamphetamine appears to be twice his age, his teeth missing and his nose shattered . The mugshot on the left was made in 2009. The 31-year-old alleged heroin addict was booked into jail again earlier this year (right) More than 14 years of cocaine use turned this 64-year-old addict into a wrinkled old man . Drug use is often accompanied by self-neglect, as exemplified by this 24-year-old drug suspect . The series Faces of Addiction was created to show the physical transformation of people suffering from substance abuse . Breaking bad: In a matter of four years, this 44-year-old man accused of cooking meth appeared before a camera with his face covered in open sores . Premature aging: This woman, age 52, was arrested for possession of cocaine. The 'before' photo was taken in 2004, and the 'after' in 2013 . Addicts often suffers from skin lesions and open sores that do not heal. This woman is only 30 years old . A 32-year-old man arrested for selling methamphetamine appears to be twice his age, his teeth missing and his nose shattered. One of the more shocking sequences in the series involves a 46-year-old addict arrested for possession of cocaine. The 'before' booking photo taken in 2009 shows him as a heavyset, ruddy man with a full beard. Five years later, he is a shell of a man, his toothless mouth like a crumpled origami and his lined cheeks sallow and sunken. An equally startling transformation occurrs in a female addict, who at age 59 looks to be in her 70s . The GIF shows her wasting away over the course of 16 years, losing most of her teeth and hair, with every inch of her face lined and creased. Perhaps one of the more eye-opening examples of the ravages of drugs involves a 23-year-old woman arrested for possession of painkillers. Over the course of a single year, the woman was arrested at least six times, Her latest booking photo taken this year shows her disfigured by open sores covering her forehead, nose and chin.

"Orphaned teenager Davion Only gave a tour of his foster home bedroom on Thursday as he continues his search to find the family he has always yearned for. The 15-year-old revealed the cramped, shared room in St Petersburg where he keeps his only possessions under lock and key. He was so worried about his belongings being stolen that he hid the padlock under his hand as he opened the locker in front of TV cameras. Davion's story has garnered nationwide attention and become a viral topic online after he stood up in a Florida church last month and asked if someone would please adopt him. Around 1,000 people have now contacted Davion's foster home to ask about him. He told ABC on Thursday: 'People just don't know sometimes how hard it is and how much we try to do good.'

He added: 'I just want people to love me for who I am and to grab me and keep me in their house and love me no matter what.' The boy's moving plea has sparked an . incredible reaction online with close to 400,000 people reading his . story on MailOnline. It has also been shared by 1,700 people on MailOnline's Facebook page and received nearly 6,000 likes. His . foster home, the Carlton Manor residential center, is being inundated . with more than 1,000 calls from potential adoptive parents across . America.

'#Eckerd and our community partners have mobilized to create a call center to respond to each and every call coming in about #Davion. 'We ask that folks be patient, we are incredibly grateful for the outcry of interest in Davion and we will get back to everyone as soon as we can. We are nearing 1,000 inquiries already! #secondchances' The heartbreaking insight into a . child's life in foster care emerged after Davion, who recently . discovered his mother had died, spoke to worshippers at St Mark's Missionary Baptist Church in September. Davion Only speaks before St Mark's Missionary Baptist Church in September to ask if someone would become his parents . Davion started to look for his mother, whom he had never met, using his birth certificate at a local library in June. He found her obituary and discovered that La-Dwina Ilene 'Big Dust' McCloud (left) had died aged 55 in Clearwater just weeks before . He said: 'My name is Davion and I've been . in foster care since I was born... I know God hasn't given up on me. So I'm not giving up either. 'I'll take anyone. Old or . young, dad or mom, black, white, purple. I don't care. And I would be . really appreciative. The best I could be.' Terri . Durdaller, spokesman for Florida Department of Children and Families . Suncoast region, told MailOnline on Thursday that Davion's foster home had . received hundreds of calls about him. She added: 'We're hopeful that we can connect Davion with his forever family.' Photographer Tim Boyles, took Davion's picture for adoption charity the Heart Gallery in 2005 and again earlier this year. Searching his whole life: Davion Navar Henry Only, pictured in 2005 when he was just 7 years old. Davion, who lives in Florida, is now 15 and still looking for a family to adopt him . He told MailOnline: 'It broke my heart to photograph Davion a second . time. It had been eight years since I first photographed him for the . Heart Gallery. 'He had grown up into such a fine, young man from the cute, . little boy he was in 2005, but one thing hadn't changed.  Davion was still . living in group homes and foster care.' Davion's portrait is one of many in the Heart Gallery - an organization which helps children in foster care find moms and dads. Each child has a short profile on the site telling prospective parents something about who they are. Each article begins with an ID number from the foster care system and the words 'I am available'. Davion, . who is pictured smiling on the beach and throwing a basketball in the . air, writes that his favorite school subject is science and that when he . grows up he wants to be a police officer.

Cartoon Network. When it comes to his friends, Davion looks for those . who are true to themselves and to him. On . his ideal family, the teenager says he doesn't care if the people are . rich or poor or what ethnic background they are from. He would like a . family 'who are nice, fun and that know how to cook!' The 15-year-old also gives a short description of what he is like for any family out there. Davion writes that he is: 'Nice and fun and would be happy to be adopted! Davion says the nicest thing he has ever done is a save a boy from drowning.' Davion Navar Henry Only told the congregation at Florida's St Mark's Missionary Baptist Church that he didn't mind who the parents were who adopted him because he would be 'really appreciative' Davion Only, 15, gets some last-minute help with his tie from his case worker Connie Going before nervously making his speech before the congregation . Sadly, Davion's story of lifetime in . foster care is far from unique in the U.S. There are currently 399,548 children in the system across America, many being cared for by . devoted, temporary parents, and yet lacking in a definite place they can . call home. There are many older teenagers like Davion but fewer than 10 per cent of children adopted from foster care are between 14 and 17. Davion himself knows how hard it is to find a family - indeed it was his idea to approach the St . Petersburg church to find his own adoptive parents and take control of . his future. In three years time when he turns 18, he is aware that he . will be on his own. Davion will turn 16 on February 12, 2014. The average number of children who age out of the U.S. foster care system each year is 20,000. Last month, Davion spoke quietly in front of the full pews at the Florida church wearing an over-sized, donated suit that had come from his latest foster home. Davion Only's profile on the Heart Gallery is one of many children who are searching for a permanent home . Davion's profile has been on the Heart Gallery for eight years, since his first photograph was taken at seven years old . The boy was born while his mother was in jail and has spent his entire childhood in countless foster homes. He told his caseworker Connie Going that he knows his adoptive parents are out there somewhere. In June, Davion had come to terms with the death of his mother after he used his birth certificate to search for her for the first time on a computer at his local library. He found her mugshot from her arrests for petty theft and cocaine. And then he found her obituary. La-Dwina Ilene 'Big Dust' McCloud had died aged 55 in Clearwater, Florida just weeks before. He cried in the library when he read that his mother had died and remembered thinking to himself: 'This is ridiculous. How did I not know?' Davion does not know any other members of his family. The 15-year-old has spent the past few years at Carlton Manor residential group home in Eckerd, living with 12 other teenage boys, all suffering their own problem. Looking for a family: 15-year-old Davion spoke to the church congregation about how badly he wanted a family to care about him . Davion longs to play football but has no one to take him to practice; to be able to use the bathroom without someone unlocking a door. He would like the light left on when he sleeps and a bed that he can call his own. The 15-year-old has had . behavioral problems - struggling with his own anger at the circumstances . in which he finds himself. Dealing . with his mother's death has led Davion to believe that he doesn't want . to be angry anymore - he wants to discover a better life. Davion told ABC: 'I'm not going to use all my bad stuff that happened to me as an excuse, but I'm going to use it as motivation to push me more and give me more courage.' He . has spent the summer studying hard in 10th grade - achieving As in all . but one subject - geometry. He has lost 40lb and tries to let go of his . anger. Davion also has . support from his mentor Richard Prince, 22. The two were paired up . through the One Church One Child program and usually go to a park to . play basketball or talk.

"Madonna returned to Malawi today for the first time since her furious row with the country's former president 18 months ago. The singer is believed to have flown in this morning with the two children she adopted from the central African country and her other son for surprise talks with the new leader. Her visit will fuel speculation the star is looking to adopt another child after she posted pictures online today showing her playing with young Malawian children, apparently at an orphanage. Madonna, who funds orphanages in the country and is helping to build schools and hospitals, was unceremoniously sent packing in April last year after a dispute with ex-president Joyce Banda. Mrs Banda attacked the pop star for being 'arrogant' and bizarrely accused her of being less well-mannered than footballers Gary Neville or Rio Ferdinand 'despite their equally dazzling stature'. Scroll down for video . Back in favour: Madonna shared this picture showing her playing with young Malawian country after arriving in the central African country for the first time since falling out with the former president in April last year . Sharing her experiences: The singer posted this selfie (left) on her Instagram page just before she arrived in Africa. She also posted a picture of a Malawian toddler (right) with the message: 'I just met a girl named Maria' Cute: Madonna shared this image of a Malawian child with the caption: 'Who's That Girl?' One follower replied: 'Is that your new baby girl? She's adorable! She's telling you with her eyes take me with you...' A statement released by her office, which Mrs Banda later distanced herself from,  accused the star of wanting Malawi 'to be forever chained to the obligation of gratitude' for her charity work. It also claimed Madonna believed the country should have 'rolled out a red carpet and blast the 21-gun salute' upon her arrival. Mrs Banda, whose sister Anjimile Ntila-Oponyo used to run Madonna's Raising Malawi charity until her sacking over financial impropriety, stripped the singer of her 'Very Very Important Person' (VVIP) status. This fall-out forced Madonna, 56, to check into her private jet at Kamuzu International Airport as an 'ordinary passenger'. However, new president Peter Mutharika, who beat Banda at the May polls, has restored Madonna's VVIP status. State House press secretary Frederick Ndala said: 'We welcome Madonna as guest of the government and people of Malawi. 'The President appreciates the charity work she is doing for the people of Malawi.' Madonna with the two children she adopted in Malawi, David Banda (left) and Mercy James (right), in a classroom at Mkoko Primary School on a visit in April last year when she clashed with the  former president . Madonna mingles with children at Mkoko primary school in the region of Kasungu in March last year . Madonna is scheduled to hold talks with President Mutharika on Friday  at his official Kamuzu Palace in the capital, Lilongwe. Madonna's 12-member travelling party is believed to include sons Roco John Ritchie and David Banda and daughter Mercy Chifundo James. They are said to have arrived at Kamuzu International Airport in Lilongwe at 11am. 'We were asked to clear the airport's cargo bay for a special guest,' said an airport worker, who saw the jet land. He said Madonna was whisked into a fleet of SUVs and raced into town to Kumbali Lodge, a farm lodge she always stays at on her Malawi visits. Brotherly love: The proud Material Girl singer shared this Instagram picture of her son Rocco, 14, taking his siblings Mercy and David, both eight, to school in New York in September . Family flight: On Thursday the 56-year-old along with Mercy, David and Rocco flew into JFK after enjoying a long summer vacation in Europe earlier this year . Madonna first visited Malawi in 2006 after her Malawian friend Victoria Keelan told her about the impoverished southern African country's AIDS situation. She immediately adopted then one-year-old David Banda at an orphanage. She adopted her second Malawian child, Mercy Chifundo James, in 2009, at another orphanage. She periodically visits Malawi, often with all her children - including daughter Lourdes who has not made the trip this time around. She funds a number of orphanages, including Home of Hope in the western border district of Mchinji where she got David, and Kondanani Children's Home in the southern tea-growing district of Thyolo. She is also building a number of schools and a paediatrics ward at the Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre - which she is scheduled to visit during her trip, according to sources.","Star reportedly arrived with two children she adopted from African nation .

"There's a new problem child at The View, and this time it's NOT Rosie O'Donnell. Well, not exactly. Sources close the show tell MailOnline that Rosie Perez's diva antics have gone into overdrive. Perez has become a terror behind the scenes, following the lead of (once) best bud Rosie O'Donnell in berating producers and having blow-ups over segments in the hot topics meeting. Last week Perez had a major melt down after a hostile, gum-chewing Rosie O treated her with disdain during an on-air segment discussing the rape allegations against Bill Cosby. Scroll down for video . Rosie redux:  Rosie Perez has become a terror behind the scenes, following the lead of best bud Rosie O'Donnell in berating producers and having blow-ups over segments in the hot topics meeting . Whoopi wanted to avoid  highly charged topics while Rosie O wanted to attack them with all guns blazing . Professor Cosby: The conversation was anything but educational when The View hosts got together to discuss the allegations of rape against Cosby, who was a keynote speaker at Spelman College last May . Perez had argued that Cosby has been pilloried by social media and that there is no way to prove that the allegations are true. Perez attempted to defend her opinion to O'Donnell but O'Donnell wasn't having it. At all. 'You think this is more about social media comments on the allegations, not about the allegations themselves..., said Rosie O, clearly disgusted with the turn of the conversation.a . After the two debated whether the corporations had the correct response to the Cosby allegations, O'Donnell seemingly expressed her disapproval over Perez's social media commentary. Whoopi tried to support the frustrated Perez and said, 'Until you know that it's true, it's an allegation.' But Rosie remained unconvinced and hostile. After the show, Perez then went to the new ABC News executives and told them that Rosie O 'crossed the lines,' during the Cosby debate.  She told them 'I don't know how much longer I can work with her!' Rosie Perez 'was very likable at the beginning, but now she's rarely pleased with the topics, often complains and fusses at producers constantly,' a show insider explained. In another recently reported incident, Rosie Perez was in tears as Whoopi Goldberg and Rosie O'Donnell duked it out over whether or not they should even discuss the onslaught of women coming forward to claim that Bill Cosby raped and drugged them as well as the racial tension in Ferguson, Mo. Whoopi wanted to avoid the highly charged topics while Rosie O wanted to attack them with all guns blazing. In a pre-show meeting the squabbling stars aired their differences causing Perez to break down in tears. Rosie wants her hair to look like J.Lo's.  Emmy winning makeup and hair people who have done J.Lo in the past just can't seem to please Rosie . The View insider also revealed the in-house glam team at the show is fed up with Perez, who is on her sixth makeup artist in two months and does her own hair most days. 'She's so insecure about her looks. She wants her look to emulate Jennifer Lopez's, but the Emmy winning makeup and hair people who have done J.Lo in the past just can't seem to please her,' one insider revealed. The View staffers will get a reprieve soon as Perez has to take a few weeks off from The View in January to rehearse for her starring role in the Broadway play Fish in the Dark opposite Larry David that opens in February. 'Everyone is counting down the days until she takes her mini hiatus. She'll be gone at least four weeks and her absence means there's one less diva the team will have to deal with,' the insider added. ABC News has been looking at a few replacement hosts to fill in the entire time for Perez. Among the contenders are Glee's Naya Rivera, newscaster Jacque Reid, HGTV's Egypt Sherrod and journalist Laura Ling, sister of former View co-host Lisa Ling.","Rosie Perez has gone diva on The View .

"Obama bolstered his reelection coffers to the tune of $15million last night following a star studded Hollywood dinner where George Clooney played the suave host and Chef Wolfgang Puck whipped up dinner. Obama reminded 150 of his Hollywood set donors that his famed Hope poster from the 2008 was derived from a photograph of Obama sitting next to Clooney when Obama was a U.S. senator. Clooney had been in Washington advocating on behalf of Darfur. 'This is the first time that George Clooney has been photo-shopped out of a picture,' Obama said. 'Never happened before, never happen again.' Scroll down for video . Motorcade: The bevy of cars signaled that President Obama was en route to George Clooney's house . Arrival: Mr Obama came to California from Washington where other fundraisers were held earlier Thursday . In this crowd, Obama didn't even need to mention gay marriage to get a vigorous applause. 'Obviously,' the president said obliquely, 'yesterday we made some news.' The event, held under a stretched . transparent tent outside Clooney's sprawling tudor-styled canyon home that he bought about 20 years ago from Fleetwood Mac singer Stevie Nicks, . raised nearly $15million, a record for a single fundraiser. The guests paid $40,000 to attend, . accounting for about $6 million of the evening's financial haul for . Obama's campaign and the Democratic Party. Political pals: Clooney and President Obama have met on a number of occasions, like this Darfur event in April . The invitation for the sold-out fundraiser on behalf of President Barack Obama at the Studio City home of George Clooney . The remainder came from a raffle for . small dollar donors. Two winners - both women - got to take part in the . dinner. One winner was Beth Topinka, 55, a science teacher from New Jersey. Her son was in the Navy, and her husband- though a Republican- voted for Mr Obama in 2008. The second winner was Karen Blutcher, 45, who works for a utility company in St Augustine, Florida. She brought her husband, who served in the military, as her guest. In the advertisement for the competition, the upbeat president wrote: 'You'll automatically be in the . running to join me and George Clooney at his place on May 10th. 'It's not often I get away from work, so I look forward . to spending a fun evening in LA with a couple supporters like you.' Photoshopped out: In his speech at the fundraiser, Mr Obama reminded the crowd that Clooney was actually sitting next to him at the event where the picture used for the famous 'Hope' was taken . Sign of the house: George Clooney's drive warns of a pig because the actor was known for having one as a pet . 'We raised a lot of money because people love George,' Obama said. 'They like me; they love George.' Aside from a small number of brief interjections of serious talk, Mr Obama kept the majority of his speech light. 'And Michelle and I -- people have . commented on the fact that I've got gray hair now. There was a blog post . about look how wrinkly Obama is getting. It was sort of distressing. George doesn’t have to go through these things,' he said. 'Sometimes the 2008 campaign gets . romanticized and everybody says how perfect it was and I have to remind . them, no, I was there.' 'Better than the Oscars': The food was prepared by celebrity chef Wolfgang Puck . End of the night: Billy Crystal waits for his car after the extravagant dinner at George Clooney's home . The big bottom line of the event will . help the President's re-election campaign funding, as he faces the huge . sums of money raised by Republican groups like American Crossroads, set up by Karl Rove. Obama's campaign chief David Axelrod . told Politico that it would take 181,000 of their small-time donors to . match a recent anonymous $10m donation to Crossroads. 'So George is pitching in here, and lending his name to this . event, and himself to this event. It's really helpful to us.' Crossroads, however, have seized on the planned dinner as another opportunity to attack Obama for being a 'celebrity president'. The star power certainly helps the Democrat's bottom line, however, as Clooney told the Wall Street Journal last . month that they had already raised around $10m, 'which is about . double anything that's ever been done before. All I know is that it's . the biggest fundraiser to date - ever.' At the dinner, Mr Obama gave serious . compliments to the host, adding: 'He seems to occupy a constant state of . grace, and uses his extraordinary talents on behalf of something truly . important.' In attendance: Clooney's girlfriend Stacy Keibler (left), actor Robert Downey Jr. (center), and actress Salma Hayek (right) are among the 150 guests . Star-filled room: Jack Black (left), Barbra Streisand (center), Tobey Maguire (right) are all thought to be there . The Oscar-winning film star has hit the headlines recently for his involvement in the humanitarian campaign over Sudan. He was even arrested while attempting to draw attention to the bombing of refugees in the Nuba valley. For Obama, the A-list party was not . only a financial hit, it gave the president the kind of Hollywood buzz a . Republican seldom gets. But the glitzy event, with its glamour and . wealth, also has its risks and it set up a stark contrast with Obama's . mission on Friday to highlight the plight of struggling homeowners in . Nevada. Among those at the dinner were such . actors and performers as Robert Downey Jr., Barbra Streisand and her . husband James Brolin, Jack Black, Salma Hayek and Tobey Maguire, who . shared a table with Clooney and Clooney's girlfriend Stacey Kiebler. Preparations: The catering trucks lined the street outside George Clooney's Hollywood home on Thursday . All the little details: A server is seen carrying in peanuts, but given that guests are paying $45,000 for a seat at the dinner, they'd better hope the kitchen was focusing on the main meals . Serious security: Police surrounded Clooney's home for the days leading up to the event Thursday night . Soda and beer: Little is known about what is being served at the dinner, but beverages were seen being delivered to Mr Clooney's home on Thursday . There was speculation that other guests may include Obama supporters Halle Berry, Scarlett Johansson, Reese Witherspoon and Harvey Weinstein. Details have been kept strictly under wraps, but website TMZ revealed that diners will be catered for by famous chef Wolfgang Puck, adding that the food would be 'better than the Oscars.' Heading to Clooney's house, along the . exclusive canyon roads, families gathered at dinner time to gawk, wave . and cheer the presidential motorcade. Children manned a lemonade stand . with a sign: 'Presidents drink free.' Around the corner, a boy held up another hand-drawn piece of cardboard: 'Will trade Lakers for Bulls if you stop.' And yet one more: 'Our gay family says thanks Mr. President.'","Diners have paid up to $40,000 to attend the glittering LA event .

"It seems that the Grinch is alive and well and living in Texas. A thief who apparently was not very much in the holiday spirit stole an entire lawn of Christmas decorations from the home of the Collins family in Saginaw, Texas, angering mother Kristine and devastating 6-year-old daughter Halliee. But now, Kristine is getting her revenge, and all by taking the high road. Scroll down for video . Heartbroken: The Collins family (above) was heartbroken when they discovered someone stole their Christmas decorations from their front yard . Payback: Mom Kristine then made a sign calling out the thief, and letting them know they broke her daughter Hallie's heart .

'I wanted the people to know that I know what they did,' Kristine toldMy Fox 28. 'I don't want other people waking up and having their 5- or 6-year olds crying in tears over why their decorations were gone.'

Tony Ball, 92, was asked for ID when he went to buy two bottles of Vodka for a family Christmas party from Tesco in Feltham . 'I laughed but she then said, ""We're not allowed to serve you if you're under age"",' he said. 'By the look on her face she wasn't joking. I said, ""Do you mean it?"" and she said, ""Yes"".

The shaky footage shot September 29 on the Henry Hudson Parkway begins with a large group of bikers surrounding Lien's black Range Rover. Scroll down for videos . New evidence: The grainy 51-second footage of the September 29 biker attack was obtained by ABC Eyewitness News . Marks of violence: The Range Rover's rear right tire is flat, and there is a in the rear windshield . Ganging up: The shaky video shows a group of bikers converging on the driver of the SUV and dragging him out of the vehicle . The vehicle seen in the video exhibits clear signs of violence: its rear right tire is flat, and there is a gaping hole in the rear windshield. Just seconds later, several motorcyclists could be seen approaching the driver's side of the vehicle and pulling Lien out of the car. The graphic footage then depicts men in helmets surrounding Lien lying on the ground and proceeding to kick and stomp him. In the next frame, the young married father could be seen lying motionless with his face down. The 33-year-odl man needed stitches after the beat-down that took place after he ran over biker Edwin Mieses in his SUV while trying to escape from the scrum of motorcyclists. The biker was left with spinal injuries and may be paralyzed. Investigators reportedly used this 51-second video to identify the alleged assailants, among them several police officers, and arrest them. A ninth biker, 40-year-old Jason Brown, was taken into custody Monday night in Brooklyn in connection with the Lien assault. He is charged with gang assault, assault and criminal mischief. Meanwhile, an undercover police detective arrested in a motorcyclist-SUV melee no longer plans to testify before a grand jury, his lawyer said Monday. Brutal: The clip shows men in helmets surrounding Lien lying on the ground and proceeding to kick and stomp him . Police reportedly have seen this clip and used it to identify the suspected attackers . Aftermath: The young married father is seen here lying motionless with his face down after the beating . Badly injured: Lien needed stitches after he was attacked by bikers in New York. He hit some bikers in a bid to escape them but they caught up and beat him . Attorney John Arlia initially indicated that Detective Wojciech Braszczok wanted to speak to the Manhattan grand jury that's considering indicting him. But Arlia said Monday he's advised Braszczok not to do so ‘because the evidence speaks for him.’ ‘My client has complete confidence and faith this grand jury will determine that he in no way intended to injure, nor act in any way to injure’ an SUV driver who was beaten by several other bikers, the attorney said. Video and other evidence will show Braszczok didn't come close to contact with the driver, Arlia said. The Manhattan district attorney's office has said Braszczok nonetheless actively participated in the attack by shattering the SUV's back window and kicking its passenger side, and he has been charged with gang assault. The DA's office declined to comment Monday on his decision not to testify. Many defendants ultimately choose not to testify before grand juries, for various reasons. It's not uncommon for defendants to give notice that they want to appear and then change their minds. Suspect: Biker Kaliq Douglas, 28, of Brooklyn, was arrested last week in connection with the road rage attack . Claims: Clint Caldwell, 32, alleges that Alexian Lien, 33, ignited the violence by throwing a water bottle at the cyclists during the incident on the West Side Highway last month . Braszczok was off-duty when he participated in a Sept. 29 motorcycle rally that took a violent turn. He's one of several riders who have since been arrested.’ After the SUV driver bumped a bike that had slowed in front of it, motorcyclists surrounded and converged on the Range Rover SUV; its driver fled in fear for the loved ones riding with him and ran over a biker, and motorcyclists chased him, pulled him from the vehicle and attacked him, police and prosecutors say. The encounters were partly caught on a helmet-camera video posted online. The SUV driver, Alexian Lien, hasn't been charged with any crime. Braszczok did nothing to stop the assault or summon help, didn't report having been there to his superiors for a few days, and wasn't straightforward when he did, prosecutors said. Keeping mum: Braszczok, pictured in a courtroom sketch (left) and leaving court earlier this month (right), said that he will not testify before a grand jury . The detective was stripped of his gun and badge after internal affairs investigators discovered he saw at least part of the confrontation. He initially told authorities and his union that he didn't intervene in the attack partly because he works undercover. Arlia has said that the window Braszczok is accused of breaking already had a sizeable hole in it. The detective didn't know other participants in the rally, which was organized online, and he pursued Lien only to prevent his flight after the SUV ran down and seriously injured motorcyclist Edwin Mieses Jr., Arlia said. ‘The facts cannot be changed to lump him into an attack he was not a part of. We owe him and his family at least that much,’ Arlia said by phone Monday. Terror: Lien was dragged from his car and beaten by bikers on September 29 in front of his wife and two-year-old daughter on a New York highway . Braszczok has been a police officer for a decade. It's unclear when the grand jury might vote on whether to indict him. Kaliq Douglas, 28, of Brooklyn was charged last week with gang assault and assault with intent to cause serious injury for his involvement, . Bikers Reginald Chance, Clint Caldwell and Craig Wright made court appearances last week on October 11.","The 51-second video was recoded September 29 on Henry Hudson Parkway in New York City .

"A neo-Nazi linked to Norwegian mass killer Anders Behring Breivik has been arrested in France today following fears he might stage a large 'terrorist act'. Kristian Vikernes, a well-known black . metal musician in Norway, was arrested with his French wife Marie . Chachet after she recently bought four rifles. The 40-year-old, who is a convicted murderer from Norway, had in the past received a copy of a manifesto from Breivik, the far-right militant who killed 77 people in 2011. Neo-Nazi:  Kristian Varg Vikernes, pictured left in 1999,  has been arrested in France on suspicion of planning a terrorist attack. He has previously received a copy of a manifesto from Anders Behring Breivik, right . In a statement, France's Interior Minister Manuel Valls said: 'Having received the manifesto before (Breivik) committed his crimes and having been sentenced in Norway in the past for murder, this individual, who was close to a neo-Nazi movement, was likely to prepare a large terrorist act.' Officers were searching his home in Correze for weapons and explosives, a police source said. Breivik killed 77 people in a bombing in central Oslo and a shooting spree on a nearby island in July 2011. He was imprisoned last year for a maximum term of 21 years. Breivik sent a copy of his manifesto setting out his ideology to Vikernes, an official at the Paris prosecutor's office said. Held: Vikernes was arrested by intelligence officers at his home in France (pictured) Breivik's 1,500-page manifesto outlined his planned crusade against Muslims, who he said were taking over Europe and could only be defeated through a violent civil war. Cachet, 25, had a legal firearms permit when she bought the four rifles, the official said. 'The investigation will notably establish the conditions in which these (rifles) were acquired and their real objective,' Valls said. On his website, Vikernes discusses Breivik's manifesto, but in a post called 'War in Europe: Part V - Breivik Unveiled' he also criticises the murderer for killing more innocent Norwegians than Muslims. Vikernes describes himself as a 'pagan' and accuses Breivik of being a Zionist agent and 'Christian loser'. Rural: This image shows cars parked outside the house of the Norwegian neo-Nazi black metal rocker and convicted killer which was raided this morning . 'If you, dear European nationalists, really want to save Europe (as a biological term) you have to realise that the only thing to do is to cast aside all Christian other international nonsense and embrace only the European (i.e. Pagan) values and ideals and if you like the European deities as well,' said the posting, dated December 13. 'If you work for Christianity in any way you work for the Jews. Plain and simple.' Vikernes, a black metal musician and writer known as Varg, was convicted in 1994 of stabbing a rival musician to death in Oslo and burning down several churches. Horrific: A swat team aim their weapons while people take cover during Anders Behring Breivik's massacre . He was released from jail in 2009 and moved to France with his wife and three children. The mayor of Salon La Tour, where Vikernes and his wife lived, said he had been surprised by the arrest. 'I didn't notice anything strange (about Vikernes) other than that he liked to wear military costumes and liked Gothic music,' Jean-Claude Chauffour told BFM TV.

"A Dallas bus and train station was brought to a standstill on Saturday after a woman reportedly vomited at the facility, sparking fears she had Ebola, but the transit authority now say she was never on a watchlist as someone exposed to the virus.

"Richard Montañez is a walking, talking American Dream. Working as a janitor at a California factory with no qualifications and barely able to speak English, the Mexican native's simple idea for a snack took him from mopping floors to meeting U.S. presidents and flying in corporate jets. It all started in 1976 at the Frito-Lay plant in Rancho Cucamonga, when a machine broke in the Cheetos assembly line. 'Some of them were missing the cheese because the machine had broken, so I took some home. I put some chili powder on it, and it tasted good, Montañez said. American Dream: Richard Montanez spoke at an annual Power of Diversity event and told the crowd how his 'PhD' - poor, hungry and determined - lead him to the position of executive vice president, multicultural sales and community activation, for PepsiCo North America . So he came up with a recipe that . his family, friends and coworkers loved before making the brave decision to take his . idea to the CEO of the company. The father-of-three persuaded the secretary to put his call through to the CEO who, after hearing his idea, invited him to do a demonstration. Montañez didn't even own a tie, but . he rushed out to buy one and picked up a book on marketing from the . library to prepare his pitch. The . president loved the idea and since then, the flaming hot line of . products was born, including 'Flamin' Hot Cheetos' - which is one of . Frito-Lay’s top selling snacks. Great idea: Flamin' Hot Cheetos are now one of Frito-Lay's biggest selling snack . The 55-year-old's simple idea also influenced future ethnic products including Hispanic products for KFC and Taco Bell. Montañez was a keynote speaker on Tuesday at the Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce’s annual Power of Diversity event. During his speech, he told the crowd how his 'PhD' - poor, hungry and determined - lead him to the position of executive vice president, multicultural sales and community activation, for PepsiCo North America, The Kansas City Star reported. 'If you’re leading a company and you . don’t have diversity, you don’t have inclusion. I don’t know how you’re . going to survive,' he said. 'I . don’t know how you got this far. 'My disqualifications are the very things . that qualified me. Your own people will hold you back,' he . warned them. 'Break ranks. That’s diversity and inclusion. Don’t just . hang out with your own.' His prime message was that 'there’s no such thing as ""just a janitor""...if you act like an owner'. In the last three decades, the former janitor has met U.S. presidents, spoken at the United Nations, teaches leadership to MBA students at a California University and travels in corporate jets. He was recognized by Hispanic Lifestyle magazine as one of the most influential Hispanics in corporate America and has been featured in News Week and Fortune 500 magazine. The 55-year-old often tells a story from his childhood, when the other kids in school would stare at him because he brought in a burrito for lunch and they all had bologna sandwiches. When he asked his mother if she could make him the same lunch as the other kids, she said no and told him, 'This is who you are'. The next day she gave him two burritos and told him to make a friend. By the end of the week, he was selling them for 25 cent each. Since becoming a success, he has given back to his community by providing scholarships to young Latinos as well as food, clothing, school supplies and other services for Feed the Children. The father-of-three still lives in Rancho Cucamonga with his wife of more than 30 years, Judy.","Richard Montañez came up with the idea after the Cheeto machine broke in the factory where he worked .

"They blew kisses to the crowd and thumped the air with joy after being crowned Olympic silver medallists. But within minutes, Britain’s male gymnasts were told there had been a mistake with the score. They had, in fact, won bronze. The gymnastics team were told they had been downgraded after the Japanese successfully appealed against their  own marks. Japan leaped from fourth to second and China convincingly took the gold. Scroll down for video . Rollercoaster: Top, the Team GB gymnasts celebrate what looks like a silver medal win before, bottom, hearing the Japanese appeal means it is in fact bronze . Bronze medalists Daniel Purvis, Max Whitlock, Louis Smith, Kristian Thomas and Sam Oldham on the podium . Viewers are demanding more medal ceremonies on the BBC’s main Olympics coverage – even when a British competitor is not involved. Fans have been frustrated by the broadcaster’s decision to ignore various presentations in favour of studio chat or cutting to other coverage. Critics say it is as much a part of the Games to see the medal ceremonies as the contests themselves. While the BBC showed swimmer Rebecca Adlington’s medal presentation on Sunday night, other ceremonies from that night’s action were not shown. Viewers expressed their frustration on the corporation’s message-boards. One said: ‘The BBC don’t seem to understand the pride and emotion that is enjoyed when watching the medal ceremonies? Another said: ‘Why deny BBC viewers smiling faces of the winning athletes at the medal ceremonies?’ A BBC spokesman said: ‘All the ceremonies are being shown on the Olympic channels. On BBC One and Three, we take them on editorial merit.’ Yet, in a display of dignity and . sportsmanship, the five stoical young Britons refused to be disappointed . and, as they stood on the podium, they kissed their medals and waved to . their adoring fans. It was, after all, the first podium medal for a British gymnastics team for 100 years, since the 1912 Stockholm Olympics. London 2012 poster boy and Beijing . bronze medallist Louis Smith, 23, and his four teammates had entered the . North Greenwich Arena with an outside chance of a medal. But the deafening roars of the home . crowd cheered Smith, Daniel Purvis, 21, Max Whitlock, 19, Kristian . Thomas, 23, and Sam Oldham, 19, through to a podium position. The athletes were watched by Prince . William and Prince Harry – who sat tensely with their fists in front of . their mouths during the final minutes – as the team performed . spectacular routines in all six disciplines. Smith, the captain of the team and a . favourite to win a medal later this week on the pommel horse, said: . ‘Despite the protesting getting the scoring changed, this is a dream . come true for all of us. ‘For these guys, it’s their first Olympics, so to get a medal, a bronze medal, is unbelievable. ‘Silver, bronze, it doesn’t matter. Our target was to get fifth in the competition and enjoy the . competition. We enjoyed it and we got a bronze medal.’ After a spectacular performance on . the floor exercises in the final round, Britain jumped from fourth to . second on the scoreboard, causing the 16,000-strong crowd to leap up . from their seats in jubilation. Prince William and Prince Harry look tense as they watch a gymnastics final full of twists and turns . Team Japan sit dejected after the initial result places them fourth.

Smith gestures after his performance on the pommel horse gets the Brits off to a strong start in the gymnastics men's team final . But after the Japanese believed they had been marked too harshly on the pommel horse, they appealed to judges for a re-mark. Then came the revelation that there had been an error. The devastated Ukrainian team, who thought they had won bronze, were relegated to fourth and left empty-handed. Thomas said: ‘A silver would have been nice but I couldn’t complain at all right now.’ His teammate Purvis added: ‘If . someone had said to us before the competition we would come away with a . bronze, we would be buzzing. Getting a bronze is absolutely amazing.’ After a great performance, Smith now looks in a strong position to take . gold in the individual event on the pommel horse. He has conceived the most difficult . 50-second pommel horse routine in the world which, if performed cleanly, . should prove unbeatable.

The natural showman is known for his outlandish . hairstyles and outspoken views, as well as his ability to work the crowd . up into a frenzy. Three years ago, after his success in . the individual events at the Beijing Olympics, he decided to pursue his . second dream of singing and entered the X Factor. But his singing failed to impress . Cowell and he was not sent through to the next round. He admits he . looked ‘like a goon’ and will focus on his sport – for now. It will come as a relief to his many fans, who waved flags and screamed themselves hoarse during yesterday’s tense competition. Spectator Kerstin Wolgast, 34, from . the City of London, said: ‘First we expected nothing, then out of . nothing we had silver, and then bronze – it was an emotional . rollercoaster.’ Her partner John Mills, 45, a former PE teacher, added: . ‘It was fantastic.

The NFL star whose daughter's battle with cancer is the league's feel-good story of the season has not paid child support in months, the girl's mother claims. Devon Still, who plays defensive tackle for the Cincinnati Bengals, has not paid any child support for his four-year-old daughter Leah since July, according to her mother Channing Smythe. The row threatens to overshadow what has been one of the few touching stories in a sport riddled with controversy, including allegations it was soft on domestic violence, encouraged drug use and covered up risks to players. Ms Smythe's attorney, Gloria Allred, has delivered a letter to the NFL asking it to investigate if Still has violated its Personal Conduct Policy by failing to pay child support, the New York Daily News reports. In a statement in the letter, Mr Smythe said: 'I don’t think it is fair that Devon Still, who is Leah’s father, has refused to pay any child support for her for the months of August, September, October and November of this year.' Leah was diagnosed with stage 4 neuroblastoma in June and given a 50 per cent chance of survival. She has since endured surgery to remove a tumour, five rounds of chemotherapy, one round of radiotherapy and, most recently, stem cell treatment to restore bone marrow. Much has been reported of Still's travels from Cincinnati to Delaware to be with his his daughter each time goes in for treatment, but Ms Smythe said she has been unable to work at all because Leah needs full-time care. In the letter she claimed they would be homeless if a friend of her mother hadn't taken them in, and added that she had to accept food stamps between July and October to feed herself and her sick child. Ms Smythe said she has been forced to borrow cars from friends and relatives to take Leah to Children's Hospital in Philadelphia, since the child's low immune system means its dangerous for her to be out in public. Although Still's contract with the Bengals apparently provides insurance cover for 100 per cent of Leah's medical expenses, Ms Smythe claims she has an outstanding medical bill for an ambulance she has been unable to pay. A father's love: Devon Still, 25, with his daughter Leah who is being treated for Stage 4 neuroblastoma and has been given a 50-50 chance of survival. He travels to be with her every week . Still's agent, a spokesman for the Bengals and an NFL spokesman did not respond to requests for comment when contacted by New York Daily News reporter Michael o'Keefe. Leah was the star of the show when the Bengals played the New England Patriots last month and the home team's cheerleaders paid tribute to the girl. Instead of their normal red, white and blue outfits, the Patriots' cheerleaders donned Still's Bengals jersey, a tribute which reduced the 25-year-old defensive tackle to tears on the field.

Still has not been able to devote himself fully to football since Leah's diagnosis. Initially missing out on Cincinnati's 53-man roster so he could be by his daughter's side, Still was then offered a spot on the practice squad, ensuring Leah would be covered under the team's health insurance policy. He went public with his daughter's cancer diagnosis 'not for sympathy,' he wrote on Instagram, but 'because I've come to the point where I no longer [am] feeling sorry but [want] to ask that y'all keep my daughter in your prayers... 'The more prayers that go up, the more faith we [have] that she will overcome this obstacle,' he wrote. 'if y'all know me y'all know this girl is my world...I know that she is strong and she won't let anything hold her down without a fight.' Fighting: Still posted a video of himself giving Leah a peptalk ahead of major surgery, which then went viral . Charity works: The Cincinnati Bengals have been donating the proceedings from the sales of Still's jersey to cancer research and the hospital where Leah is receiving treatment . Still has set up a donation program encouraging people to pledge money for every sack the Bengals' defense gets this season in an effort to help raise money and awareness about pediatric cancer. 'Kids always look up to their parents, but in just a matter of a week that all reversed for me,' Still wrote on the campaign page . 'I can honestly say I truly look up to my daughter now. In the four years of life she has had, she has been through way more than I have in 24. Her courage, strength, and high spirits through it all is nothing short of inspirational. In September, Still posted a video which went viral of him giving Leah a pep talk before she went into a seven-hour surgery to remove a cancerous tumour. The Cincinnati Bengals announced last month that they would donate 100 per cent of the proceeds from sales of Still’s No 75 jersey in support for cancer research and the Cincinnati Children's Hospital.","Channing Smythe says Devon Still hasn't sent child support since July .

"It looks like an image from a thriller - millions of silver silken webs stretched over a vast expanse of an empty nature reserve. But the intricate constructions are actually the work of money spiders who have released the silk webs as part of an elaborate escape plan. The mass of gossamer strands were found spread over a 130 feet wide area of scrub and grassland at a nature reserve in St Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex. Scroll down for video . A mass of silken gossamer threads have been found stretched across 130 feet of an East Sussex nature reserve, woven by tiny money spiders . They have been constructed by millions of money spiders who climb to the highest possible point they can and release silk threads to form a triangular parachute which catches the breeze and lifts the spider into the air and away from the site. The technique, known as ballooning, allows the tiny spiders, which measure around 5mm long, to travel far further than they could manage on foot. Ross Lawford and his 14-year-old nephew James found the mass of threads while out walking at the reserve. The 33-year-old, an amateur wildlife photographer, said: 'Me and my nephew were out for a walk when we came across this huge sea of webs. My nephew was stunned by the sheer mass of them, covering a massive area of flood plain, trees and gates. It must have been about 30 to 40 metres in length. 'My nephew just said ""wow, it's a sea of spiders."" All the webs were covered in spiders, which made my nephew a little worried. Money spiders release silken threads to create a triangular parachute which catches the wind, propelling them up and over long distances . The mass of fibres covers a flood plain, tree and gates at the nature reserve and looks like a mysterious sea of interwoven webs to onlookers . Dozens of spiders can be seen on the webs and the mass is so large it probably would have taken millions of money spiders to construct it . 'I've been walking in that area with him since he was little and we've never seen anything like it.' The size of the sea of webs means it would have taken millions of spiders to construct them. The fibres are usually seen when dew condenses on them but the sight is likely to be short lived as they usually disappear when wildlife and rain and wind break through them. Jess Price, a conservation officer at Sussex Wildlife Trust, said: 'This is gossamer, which is the name for the silver sheets of silken webs that remain when millions of money spiders balloon away from a site at the same time. 'Money spiders are tiny arachnids that often appear on your clothes and cars at this time of year. The sea of webs is made up of gossamer silken threads and would have been produced by spiders making the most of the warmer conditions . The mass of webs, created in triangular shapes, are used by money spiders for ballooning, which allows the 5mm arachnids to travel further . Ross Lawford discovered the strange sight with his 14-year-old nephew who described its appearance as a sea of spiders and their webs . The thin gossamer fibres are usually seen on a morning when there is dew around but are usually destroyed by the weather and animals . 'They climb up as high as they can, point their abdomen into the air and start releasing silk threads. 'These quickly form a parachute shape which catches the breeze and lifts the spider into the air. These tiny money spiders can travel much farther distances by ballooning than they ever could on foot. 'In this area there will have been millions of money spiders that created this amount of gossamer. 'The mild weather this year has meant that it has generally been a very good spider year, as there have been lots of invertebrates to eat. 'Gossamer is most commonly seen on autumn morning when dew condenses on the threads making it glisten in the sunlight, otherwise you might easily not notice it. 'Soon the weather and general wildlife will break through lots of the threads so that the gossamer gradually fades away.'","Sea of silken webs, stretching across 130 feet of St Leonards-on-Sea nature reserve in East Sussex, discovered .

"A honeymoon is the perfect chance for the newlywed couple to spend time with each other, away from the stresses of everyday life. But Kat and Steve Turner, have taken that idea and run with it - or ridden with it. Rather than taking time out for some post-wedding luxuriating on a beach or at a spa hotel, the couple decided to spend two years in a record-breaking attempt to travel the world on a tandem bicycle, sleeping in a tiny two-man tent. Incredibly, Kat, 31, had never even ridden a bike more than a few yards before they decided to take on the challenge, which they began in May this year. Scroll down for video . A bicycle made for two: Kat and Steve Turner are attempting to break the world record for the longest tandem ride ever .

The honeymoon represents an . extraordinary and testing celebration of their wedding vows, which they . made in August 2011 just eight months before they set off for . Christchurch in New Zealand. The . intrepid couple gave up well-paid jobs as a teacher and caseworker for . the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman before leaving their . chickens and cat at their home in Forest Hill, south east London, with . friends who will spend the next two years house-sitting. Six . months and almost 9,000km later they arrived in Darwin, on the northern . tip of Australia, having braved arctic temperatures, snow, heavy rain . and high winds, followed by searing heat and the mechanical challenges . of pushing Hooch, their heavily-laden tandem, to the limit. Epic ride: The couple's journey from New Zealand to London via three continents will last well into 2014 . Caseworker Kat said: 'The . first four months of this trip were so hard. We cycled through gallons . of rain and waves of gales. 'My feet felt like they were constantly soaked and at times I wanted to give up so much, so that I could enjoy a beer and good company with friends or the warmth of a fire or a Sunday roast at mum’s or a belly-aching laugh with my brother or a family knees-up in Plymouth. 'And dare I say it, even working in a dry office felt appealing at times.' But completing Australasia represents . less than a quarter of the monumental trip and the pair are now in .

Steve, 33, who taught at South . Park Primary School in Ilford said: 'We have found the first months . very hard and we haven't had the energy or the contacts to do very much . other than cycle, which isn’t exactly a traditional way of enjoying a . honeymoon! The couple get some practice in the UK before setting off on their global odyssey . 'At first, we . were also not sure whether we could do what we were planning to do but . now that we have completed six months and the Australian Outback we feel . much more confident that we can do this. 'If we do, it will be the most amazing achievement. The world record is just something we added in as a fun extra.

"An Ohio pastor was brutally attacked Sunday by a man who describes himself as a militant atheist after asking the man’s girlfriend if he was doing that very thing to her. Reverend Norman Hayes, 57, had just given a sermon at North Hampton’s Bridge Community Church, when he asked the girlfriend of an attendee who was being argumentative and confrontational during the service if she ‘felt safe.’ That man, 28-year-old James Maxie was so infuriated by the question that he accosted the reverend and brutally beat him in the face and head, so much so that the clergyman feared for his life. Charged: 28-year-old self-described militant atheist James Maxie is behind bars and charged with felony assault for beating North Hampton, Ohio Reverend Norman Hayes . Shaken: Reverend Norman Hayes was left with his nose broken in two places and in need of stitches after asking Maxie's girlfriend if she feared for her safety around Maxie . ‘I questioned his girlfriend in his presence if she felt safe,’ Hayes told WHIO. ‘He was very, very upset that I'd even suggest that he would hurt her.’ That’s when Maxie pounced, leaving Hayes with a broken nose and in need of several stitches on his face. ‘He came from nowhere and hit me…and knocked me down,’ Hayes said. ‘It was fortunate he did stop. I really believe my life was in danger.’ According to WHIO, Maxie’s girlfriend is a congregant at the church and Maxie attended with her that day. Fled: Maxie fled this North Hampton, Ohio church on foot following the assault and then ran into a corn field before being apprehended . Maxie, who has a history of sex offenses, felony assault, and aniomal cruelty, was enraged at the assertion that he beats his girlfriend . 'People need to pay for what they have done': The Ohio pastor says he forgives Maxie but that he must still be punished . ‘It looked like he was looking for an argument,’ said Hayes, who claims Maxie heckled him during the sermon and spoke of Hitler before it. But Maxie told police he was simply asked the pastor ‘questions about science and faith,’ he was struggling with and that he was at the sermon because he was ‘trying to regain my faith in God.’ While the pastor says he asked the girlfriend if Maxie was abusive, Maxie told police Hayes stated she was ‘going to hell for dating’ him. After the assault, Maxie and his girlfriend left the church and Maxie ran into a corn field and was later apprehended by Clark County, Ohio police while hiding behind an area home. And it wasn’t Maxie’s first run-in with the law. He’s also a convicted sex offender for unlawful sexual conduct with a minor, and convicted felon on previous assault charges, and he has a history of cruelty to animals. He can now add another felony assault charge, along with misdemeanor resisting arrest, to that list. A still bruised and swollen Hayes told WHIO that he’s forgiven Maxie, but that doesn’t mean he shouldn’t be punished. ‘We believe there is hope for everyone,’ Hayes said, ‘but we also believe that regardless of that, people need to pay for what they have done, and I hope he has to pay for what he has done. Get put away for a while and not hurt anyone else. In my opinion, the next person won't be as lucky as I was.’ Hayes has won an order of protection against Maxie, who is being held in lieu of $51,000 bond. Troubled: Maxie's Facebook page is peppered with references to atheism, to the evils of the church, and the hypocrisy of organized religion, but he told police that he was at the church to get back in touch with God .","Reverend Norman Hayes, 57, was beaten and feared for his life after asking James Maxie's girlfriend if she 'felt safe'

"Dozens of child sex offenders are still walking the streets because police refused to arrest them, according to a whistleblower, . Sara Rowbotham has accused police of putting a cap on the number of child sex offenders they arrested for raping and abusing young girls. The veteran social worker, who was responsible for gathering the main evidence in the 2012 Rochdale child sex abuse case, said that as a result dozens of sex offenders were still walking the streets preying on children. Dozens of child sex offenders are still walking the streets preying on children because police did not arrest them, whistleblower Sara Rowbotham said (file picture) Miss Rowbotham said limited resources and manpower during the investigation meant police had let sex offenders slip through the net. She said because police bosses became obsessed with convicting just nine perpetrators they left dozens free to continue raping and abusing young girls. ‘It’s very shocking but there are dozens of child sex offenders still on the streets because they put a cap on the number of people they would arrest,’ she said. ‘In the end this was just a tiny proportion of the number of offenders raping and abusing children and they were allowed to escape. ‘But not only did they cap the number of offenders but they also put a ceiling on the number of victims they would interview and proceed with.’ Her explosive comments will stun Greater Manchester Police whose Police and Crime Commissioner yesterday launched a report highlighting the massive problem of child sexual exploitation. The report highlighted 13,000 cases of child sex abuse in the last six years but revealed that only 1,078 offenders were convicted. Commissioner Tony Lloyd has vowed to go back and review cases where victims have made sex abuse allegations. Nine men, including these eight, were jailed for a total of 77 years for rape and trafficking after they preyed on girls as young as 13-years-old . But Miss Rowbotham, a social worker in Rochdale for more than 13 years, said the police were still doing far too little to combat on-street grooming. She said: ‘It’s still going on. The same perpetrators are still out there because police put a ceiling on the number of arrests. The actual number of suspects is huge but the number of victims is equally large. ‘They are still having to deal with the trauma of that on a day-to-day basis knowing no-one has ever been brought to justice for abusing them.’ In 2012 nine Asian men were jailed for a total of 77 years for rape and trafficking after they preyed on girls as young as 13, plying them with drugs, alcohol and money before passing them round the group for sex. A subsequent report said the girls were allowed to fall into the hands of Pakistani grooming gangs because police and social workers may have been scared of seeming racist. The whistleblower said she was still disappointed that no one has been held to account for their failings and she was disappointed with the results of a report led by MP Ann Coffey. The MP said the child sex abuse cases in Rochdale, Rotherham, Derby, Oldham, Oxford, and Peterborough were a ‘deafening wake-up call’. A report by MP Ann Coffey found that recent child sex abuse cases were a 'deafening wake-up call', but the whistleblower said she was disappointed with action taken following its publication . She has proposed measures aimed at improving arrest and conviction rates of child sex offenders in Greater Manchester. These included a review of cases marked ‘no further action’, new initiatives led by children themselves and more training for public sector workers to recognise grooming. But the whistleblower said she was still disappointed no one has been held to account for their failings and was disappointed with the results of the Coffey report. She said: ‘The victims deserve their evidence to be taken seriously. I referred dozens of cases to the police that I know were never acted upon.’ Miss Rowbotham, who fought for a Serious Case Review and was commended for her work by the Home Affairs Select Committee, was made redundant in February. Ian Hanson, chairman of Greater Manchester Police Federation, said: ‘It is grossly unfair that both the organisation and our police officer members collectively are singled out and blamed by some for what is a failure of the whole system. ‘We expect officers to build relationships with victims in the most difficult circumstances imaginable in a fraction of the time where often the education and social care system has failed to do so. Only when we understand the whole problem and the challenges involved will society start to deal with those issues.’ Detective Superintendent Jonathan Chadwick said: ‘Operation Doublet was launched in the aftermath of Operation Span in 2012 to investigate all outstanding historic allegations of child sexual exploitation in Rochdale from the same era. ‘This investigation has examined massive amounts of material held by all agencies and provided support to a large number of victims as well as arresting a significant number of offenders. ‘Doublet remains an on-going investigation with a large number of investigative staff deployed in building relationships of trust with victims and dealing with those responsible through the criminal justice system wherever possible.’","Dozens of child sex offenders are still walking free, whistleblower says .

"An upstate New York college this month made a student remove a Confederate flag from his room – which he says is a violation of his First Amendment right to freedom of speech. Matthew Papay, 19, and a Sophomore at the University of Rochester, also claims school administrators lied when telling students he choose to take it down – he was forced, he says. ‘The deans lied in the email about why I took it down — saying I did so by choice after discussion with fellow students — when in reality the school told me to take it down,’ he told the Rochester Democrat & Chronicle. Rights violated: Matthew Papay claims the school forcing him to remove the flag violated his right to freedom of speech . From North Carolina, Mr Papay told the paper he hung the divisive flag in his window as a way of celebrating where he grew up. ‘I am from North Carolina and the school is blatantly ignoring my rights to express the cultural identity I choose to identify with, even though the school prides itself on how 'culturally diverse' it is.’ Administrators have backtracked from their initial statement, which was emailed to every student, telling the paper he had incomplete information about the circumstances surrounding the flag. The school’s dean claims a graduate house advisor who forced the proud North Carolinian to take down his paper flag ‘misspoke’ and that it should have been allowed to stay, the paper said. The Confederate flag, first used by the South in the Civil War, has since come to represent slavery, bigotry and other discrimination that happened then and continued to happen among groups such as the Ku Klux Klan. The administrator continued explaining himself, adding that ‘the whole purpose of higher education is to get ideas out there that sometimes are unpalatable.’ Not racist: Mr Papay claims the flag represnts his heritage, not racism . Mr Papay first put an actual Confederate flag in the window of his residence hall room three weeks ago, he told the paper. He was promptly told to take it down by a student advisor who claimed it was a fire hazard. The advisor said the flag acts as a drape, which is not permitted, Mr Papay told the paper. After consulting with a local fire marshal over a paper flag, which he was assured would not violate regulations, he put the replica in his window – it was also condemned. ‘I understand that your flag is up out of pride and you can feel free to leave it up but on a wall of your room,’ the advisor said in an email. ‘""It should not be in the window because of the discomfort it is causing people and because it does not necessarily represent the heritage of the whole house,’ she added. Backtracked: After forcing Mr Papay to take down the flag, the school has allowed him to put it back up . The sophomore started a Facebook group regarding the flag, and gave his side of the story. Most agree he is not racist, but there was division over the message sent by the flag. ‘There is obviously a lot of people who take offense at the Confederate flag,’ one student wrote on the group’s wall. ‘I am surprised by it and not happy to hear about it,’ another student wrote. ‘I would expect this at another school.’ One student, though disagreeing with the message it sends, said that ‘if I want certain rights to be given to me, I shouldn't take away others' rights.’ Other students that wrote racist comments have been summoned to the dean’s office, but aren’t expected to face discipline. Mr Papay is free to fly his confederate flag.","Matthew Papay, 19, is a sophomore at the University of Rochester .

"Hidden beneath layers of whitewash, it is hardly a fitting way to treat a mural by one of the world's greatest artists. But now a lost Leonardo da Vinci  artwork may finally see the light of day after restorers have discovered traces that have lain buried beneath paint in an Italian castle. Hidden beneath seven layers of paint, trees sketched by the master painter have been uncovered in a room of the Sforzesco Castle. Restoration work on Leonardo da Vinci's work in the Sala delle Asse shows the mural beneath layers of paint . The Italian is thought to have begun his work when he was the court artist for the duke of Milan, Ludovico il Moro, in the late 1400s. Now restoration work on the Sala delle Asse, which da Vinci decorated during 1498 with a mural of trees, has unveiled extra sections of the original work, the La Gazetta del Mezzogiorno revealed. Some of the scenes have been uncovered underneath 17 layers of whitewash and are focusing on uncovering a huge tree root. It is not known whether the Renaissance painter completed the mural, because Milan was conquered by the French who stormed the castle and used it for their barracks, the Times reported. A red ring highlights where the tree root can be seen stuck in a rock in the uncovered mural section . The mural is kept in the 'Room of . Planks'; so called because it was a wood-pannelled lined room used as a . reception room for ambassadors. Leonardo da Vinci's mural that was hidden beneath layers of paint is being restored . The Duke was responsible for commissioning the young da Vinci to paint The Last Supper for his family's mausoleum. The castle was bombed during World War II, but the famous religious painting survived because it had been protected with sandbags. the restoration comes after a priceless Leonardo da Vinci masterpiece has been unearthed . in a Swiss bank vault - almost 500 years after he . painted it. The portrait of Italian noblewoman, Isabella d’Este, was . discovered as part of a private collection in a Swiss bank. The Italian owners have decided to keep their identity a secret. The . painting is a canvas and oil, finished rendering of a well-known pencil . sketch of the same woman, the wife of the Marquess of Mantua and one of Renaissance Italy’s most influential women . The . sketch, which was drawn in 1499, hangs in the Louvre, and is considered . a forerunner to his most famous painting, the Mona Lisa. Isabella, . who appears to share the world-famous subject's mysterious smile and . rounded chin, wanted to be painted by the all the greatest artists of . the day, which naturally included da Vinci. The preliminary sketch was greatly admired by the aristocratic lady’s friends so she asked him to finish the commission.","Trees sketched by painter have been uncovered in the Sforzesco Castle .

"Children are being banned from seeing Keira Knightley in the role of sultry temptress in a TV perfume commercial.

Chanel defended the commercial, insisting it was playful and sensual rather than overtly sexual. However, the Advertising Standards Authority ASA) disagreed at a time when many parents, including the Prime Minister, are becoming increasingly concerned about the sexualisation of children. The commercial opened with Keira in tight leathers astride a motorbike racing through city streets, before cutting to a modelling scene where she is being photographed on a bed. The relationship with the photographer becomes increasingly flirtatious and sexual as the man is seen unzipping her leather boots and attempting a kiss. At one stage the actress’s bare shoulders are seen, while she is assumed to be naked beneath some sheets. Just as the relationship seems certain to become even more intimate, she disappears out of the window and rides off leaving her would-be lover disappointed. The commercial was aired during a screening of the cartoon Ice Age 2, which has been a hit with families. Unconcerned: Actress Keira Knightley out with her mother in Rome on Tuesday night . A woman viewer complained that it was not suitable to be shown during a children’s film because it was overtly sexual. Chanel rejected the claim and said its founder, Coco Chanel, was known for being a strong, independent woman and the character in the ad was intended to reflect her spirit. The perfume giant pointed out that there was no nudity in the ad and that the character only briefly revealed her shoulders as part of a photo shoot. They said the photographer helped the actress remove her boots, rather than her clothes, as part of a wardrobe change during the photo shoot. Keira's signature look: her famous backless dress in Atonement, left, and at a premiere with her elegant shoulders as a focal point of her outfit . Chanel said while a degree of sexual tension was common in perfume ads, this particular commercial was ‘playful and sensual’. However, the ASA sided with the complainant arguing the scenes involved ‘sexually suggestive content’. The watchdog said: ‘We noted that the photographer was directly involved in unzipping the actress’s garments and that there was a suggestion that she was naked aside from a bed sheet. ‘We also noted that there was clear sexual tension between the pair and that they appeared about to kiss on the bed. ‘We considered the ad was suitable for older children, but that the sexually suggestive material was unsuitable for young children.’ Seductive motorbike ride: Keira Knightley shooting the beginning of the Chanel advert at Concorde Place in Paris .

Police arrested a 15-year-old girl and 16-year-old girl who live at the home, according to the Hartford Courant. Their identities have not been revealed because of their ages. The two females were charged with permitting a minor to possess alcohol. Glastonbury police continue to investigate and asked anyone with information to contact authorities. The girls had thrown parties on the Friday and Saturday nights that their parents were out of town. They had tried to get a third event going when they were surprised.

"This is the extraordinary moment that Hillary Clinton's security staff got into an argument with a traffic warden after he issued her car with a parking ticket. The Westminster City Council warden put an £80 penalty notice on the former US secretary of state’s silver Mercedes vehicle in Central London while she was attending an event at Chatham House. The row was caught on camera on Saturday by photographer Greg Brennan, who said five of her guards were waiting inside a Mercedes van next to her car at the time because it was raining.

In discussion: The Westminster City Council warden put a penalty notice on the silver Mercedes car (centre) Politician: Hillary Clinton (left) speaks at Chatham House and (right) gets out of her car before the event . Video: Matthew Corcoran . She had earlier arrived in a motorcade of five cars with around 10 security agents, Mr Brennan told MailOnline. Her car was parked in a bay on St James's Square in Mayfair, which costs £3.30 per hour. The warden then arrived and put a ticket on the car which had transported 65-year-old Mrs Clinton to the event, prompting her security detail to jump out of the van in protest, Mr Brennan said. The photographer claimed he saw one of the agents angrily waving his arms and flashing his badge to the warden, who remained unflustered and continued to issue the ticket to Mrs Clinton’s vehicle. Cllr Daniel Astaire, Westminster City Council cabinet member for business, told MailOnline: 'Despite our traffic marshal being questioned by the secret service for just doing his job, he was in the right. 'The former US Secretary of State was parked for nearly 45 minutes without paying. I’m sure she will understand that we have to be fair to everyone, regardless of their status on the world stage. 'For future reference, Mrs Clinton . can now also download a parking app for her iPhone which will tell her . in real time where a parking space is in the City of Westminster.' Pointing and waving: A warden arrived and put a ticket on the car which had transported her to Chatham House . Upset: The photographer said he saw one of the agents angrily waving his arms and flashing his badge . Event: Mrs Clinton was at Chatham House to collect a prize for her contribution to international diplomacy . Feud: The extraordinary row kicked off as a warden tried to put a ticket on Hillary Clinton's car in London . The parking ticket came with an £80 fine . - but would only be £40 if paid within 14 days. The fine has not yet . been paid - but an appeal could be launched at any date before October . 25. Diplomats in London have racked up £70million in unpaid congestion charge fines. Over the past ten years foreign embassies have accumulated more than 600,000 penalty charge notices after refusing to pay the charge, Transport for London said in May. Embassies now owe £70,068,175 - with the US topping the list. Over the past ten years, America has picked up 66,372 penalty charge notices totalling £7.5million. The charge, which brings in around £110million a year, costs £10 and is active in certain areas of London from 7am to 6pm on weekdays. It was claimed in 2011 that London Mayor Boris Johnson asked US President Barack Obama for a £5million cheque for unpaid congestion charge fines, but the US ambassador intervened before Mr Obama could answer. A . spokesman for Mrs Clinton - who does not enjoy diplomatic status or numberplates - has not yet responded to a comment request, and nobody at the US Embassy press office could be . reached when attempts were made yesterday. Federal law requires the Secret Service to watch over former presidents and their spouses - and Mrs Clinton's senior staff included up to eight senior state department or National Security Council officials while she was secretary of state. London Evening Standard editor Sarah Sands said on Twitter today: 'The role of London traffic wardens in the Special Relationship. We honour Hillary Clinton - then give her a parking ticket.' The politician - the wife of ex-president Bill, 67, and mother of Chelsea, 33 - was at . Chatham House to collect a prize for her contribution to international . diplomacy. She and her husband have an estimated net worth of £35million. She spoke at the event to a newspaper, calling for a ‘sensible adult conversation’ about the boundaries of state surveillance after the leaking of files by whistleblower Edward Snowden. Mrs Clinton said it would be ‘going down a wrong path’ to reject a debate following disclosures about the collection of communications data by GCHQ and America's National Security Agency. Later that evening, she posted a tweet to British foreign secretary William Hague, saying: 'Great seeing you today. I'm so pleased that our special relationship continues even after leaving office.'

"A paralysed man had a shock when he saw a nasty note left on his car for parking in a handicapped parking spot. Matt Milstead, 36, had parked in the spot before going to play a game of wheelchair rugby at a YMCA in Grand Rapids, Michigan. When Milstead, who is quadriplegic, returned, he found an anonymous handwritten note left in the door handle of his BMW. The letter said: ‘I would love to see . your wheelchair! I'm guessing male 25-35 years professional who thinks . he's got the world by the ass. But I could be wrong.’ Shocking: Matt Milstead, 36, right, with his wife, Leslie, left, found an angry handwritten note on his car because he had parked in a handicapped parking spot . The note: An angry message from a passer-by who saw the BMW parked in a handicapped parking spot . Milstead, who works for the Social Security Administration, said he was surprised and confused by the note. ‘I was kind of puzzled why he would leave this note and never met me, didn't know if I was in a wheelchair or not, but he just assumed I was just someone who tried to steal a close and convenient spot,’ he told Wood TV 8. His wife, Leslie Milstead, however, was furious by the incident and decided to act. ‘It's kind of ironic the guy was trying to right a wrong. He assumed some jerk had parked in a handicapped spot that shouldn't be, and so he was really trying. 'He probably felt like a good person and thought he was doing a good thing, but the problem is he was wrong,’ Mrs Milstead told Wood TV 8. The right to park: Milstead has a handicapped parking pass hanging in the window of his car . Protective: Milstead's wife, Leslie, was furious by the note. She wrote an angry message to the culprit telling him her husband is paralysed . She wrote a sharply-worded message on Facebook aimed at the culprit, saying: ‘You were so close on the age, he's actually 36, and he is a professional with a full time job. ‘He is also a quadriplegic, which for him means that he can no longer move his legs or his fingers in either hand. He has no grip. ‘So, if you are willing to give him your functioning hands and legs for the rest of your life in exchange for his 6-year-old BMW and handicapped parking pass, I'm sure he'd make that trade.’ Mrs Milstead then writes: ‘Why are you . so confident that a handicapped person couldn't be a hard worker who is . successful and owns a nice vehicle? Nice car: Milstead drives a BMW. Here he manages to get into the car with his wheelchair . Upsetting: Milstead says he was 'kind of puzzled' why someone would leave the note on his car . In the parking lot: Milstead was playing wheelchair rugby at this YMCA in Grand Rapids, Michigan, when the incident occurred . She says later in the message that her husband ‘just shakes his head at people like you who leave notes on his car. Trust me, you aren't the first. Ignorance is everywhere’. Mrs Milstead finishes the message by urging the person who left the note to look her husband up on Facebook to ‘see lots of pictures of that wheelchair you had questions about’. The post prompted a ripple of reactions on Facebook who are shocked about the incident. 'There are more people that think this way than you would believe,' says one comment. Another says: 'Well said that was an amazing response, there should be more people like you in this world advocating for those in wheelchairs like myself. Just like Matt I just shake people like that off, but well done!!'","Matt Milstead, 36, had parked in the spot before going to play a game of wheelchair rugby in Grand Rapids, Michigan .

"Community leaders in Missouri are demanding the removal of the white prosecutor investigating the death of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown, saying Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch is not objective enough for the 'racially charged climate' in Ferguson. 'This racially charged climate demands an independent investigation, and to be perfectly blunt, the African-American community has no confidence that your office can carry out an impartial investigation and prosecution,' state Sen. Jamilah Nasheed said. But McCulloch, who's been a prosecutor in the racially divided St. Louis County for some 23 years, is not stranger to controversy — and he's not one to give up easily. Scroll down for video . Prosecutor Robert McCulloch, who is handling the shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown, has been amid racially-charged controversies for decades . As a teenager, McCulloch — whose . mother, father, brother and two other relatives worked at the St. Louis . PD — wanted desperately to be in law enforcement. Even when he lost a leg to cancer, he continue to chase down his dream. 'I couldn’t become a policeman, so being county prosecutor is the next best thing,' McCulloch told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. His first tryout in the national spotlight came a few months after he took office in 1991, when a Guns N' Roses concert turned into a riot that ended up injuring 40 people and 25 police officers. Frontman Axl Rose was accused of hitting at least one security guard and three concertgoers, as well as thrashing a dressing room. McCulloch charged Rose with misdemeanor assault and property damage, and pursued him across the country to enforce an arrest warrant. 'Where he goes, we'll be waiting for him,' a determined McCulloch said, according to the Post-Dispatch. 'If he wants to cancel his whole schedule, fine,' he added. 'If he leaves the country, we’ll notify Customs to get him when he comes back.' Attorney Daryl Parks speaks about the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown during a news conference. Black leaders in Ferguson say that prosecutor McCulloch isn't objective enough to handle the teenager's shooting . McCulloch finally caught Rose after a public uproar and the rock star signed a plea agreement. But critics say that McCulloch is partial to police-involved violence, especially between white cops . and black suspects, going back to the shooting of his own father in . 1964. His dad, 37-year-old canine officer . Paul McCulloch, was killed in the line of duty while responding . to a kidnapping at a public housing complex. The shooter, Eddie Glenn, who was black, was sentenced to life in prison for the shooting. Then . years later, now a prosecutor in 2000, McCulloch was forced — not for the last time — to . ascertain his objectivity when community leaders began questioning his leading an investigation into the shooting of two unarmed . black men by two white police officers. The officers were not indicted. But McCulloch said his decision had nothing to do with his history. 'My father was killed many, many . years ago, and it’s certainly not something you forget, but it’s . certainly not something that clouds my judgment in looking at a case,' McCulloch told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. 'It certainly . makes you more aware of the severity of it.' Demonstrators continue to gather in Ferguson to protest the shooting of Michael Brown, raising their hands and chanting, 'Hands up, don't shoot' Democratic Congressman William Lacy Clay, of St. Louis, this week accused the prosecuting attorney of trying to taint a potential jury pool when he released a video allegedly showing Brown robbing a convenience store — on the exact same day that police released the name of the white cop behind the shooting, Darren Wilson. 'I have no faith in him,' Clay said, according to the Post-Dispatch. St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley, who has also questioned McCulloch's objectivity, has asked the state attorney general's office to appoint a special prosecutor to handle the case. If he chooses to continue handling the case, Nasheed said, Ferguson might go up in flames. 'If you should decide to not indict . this police officer, the rioting we witnessed this past week will seem . like a picnic compared to the havoc that will likely occur, because the black community will never accept that there was an impartial investigation from your office,' added the democratic senator, of St. Louis. 'On . the other hand, if you should indict, the black community will be . suspicious of your office's sincerity in carrying forth he prosecution, . as I can imagine serious questions about the lack of African-American prosecutors in the county.' But, through a spokesman, McCulloch said his office isn't backing down. 'We are working with the county police,' the spokesman, Ed Magee, told the Washington Post. 'We will continue to work with them if it proceeds to the grand jury and beyond if necessary.' A demonstrator runs away from a police officer during a protest over the shooting death of Michael Brown .","Black leaders say Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch has shown repeatedly that he can't be impartial in matters of race .

"The woman who posed for an incredibly realistic image painted on the back of a ute that shows herself being kidnapped has hit back at critics who say the artwork is in bad taste. The image shows Bree Benyon, from Townsville, lying down with her hands bound and mouth gagged and with a shovel lying on top of her. Incredibly, the image was painted by the model's sign-writer father and adorns her stepmother's ute. The image looks so real that some motorists thought there really was a woman being held hostage in the back of the vehicle. Model Bree Benyon has caused a storm of controversy over this lifelike image of her bound and gagged painted on the back of her stepmother's ute . Townsville's Bree Benyon told people against the image yesterday to 'live a little' and 'have a sense of humour' on Facebook . After receiving criticism on Facebook, she was forced to break her silence and told people to 'lighten up' about the image, which she insists is little more than a family joke. 'Live a little, have a sense of humour – obviously the picture got people's attention so the photo worked,' Benyon wrote on Facebook. Benyon's father is a professional sign-writer and painted it on the back of her stepmother’s ute, presumably in an effort to advertise his business. The image sparked controversy after it was published in the Townsville Bulletin yesterday. Some people thought the image was in poor taste, but others told people offended by it to 'get over it'. The model had just returned from a trip to the Gold Coast after she was selected to appear in Maxim magazine's 2015 bikini calendar. Ms Benyon was contacted for further comment.

"A rum named after famed porn star Ron Jeremy has been pulled from shelves in parts of Canada after customers complained it was obscene. The country's liquor authorities ordered stores in the province of Manitoba to remove bottles of the alcohol from shelves late last week. The product is called Ron de Jeremy and features an image of Jeremy's face on its label above the slogan 'the adult liquor' and 'long smooth taste.'

Banned: A rum, pictured with it's namesake Ron Jeremy, has been pulled from shelves in parts of Canada after customers complained it was obscene . But on Thursday the rum was back in stores, after the liquor authorities deemed the bottle unoffensive. 'There's nothing offensive about the name of the product or its label; you have to know who Ron Jeremy is and what his former profession was — and then that has to offend you,' Kowal told Canada's The National Post.

"They are the most unlikely contestants in a verbal battle over conservation – a 14-year-old schoolgirl and arguably the world's most powerful woman, Hillary Clinton. Bindi Irwin happens to be the daughter of the late Crocodile Hunter Steve Irwin and the teenager is now snapping at the heels of the U.S. Secretary of State after an essay she wrote for Mrs Clinton's e-journal was savaged by the editors. Although it is unlikely that Mrs Clinton had a hand in drastically editing Bindi's 1,000 word essay on conservation, the Australian teenager is furious about the re-worked presentation and has refused to allow it to go into print. Going head to head: The daughter of 'Crocodile Hunter' Steve Irwin, Bindi, pictured (left) at her father's memorial in 2006, has taken issue with Hillary Clinton (right) after an essay the teenager submitted to the Secretary of State's e-journal was savaged by its editors . What she wrote, she said, was her opinion about the way a growing world population was the greatest danger to conservation 'and I don't want that edited out.' But Mrs Clinton's editors were sticking to their guns – and Bindi was last night sticking to hers. With her father – who died when he was stabbed in the heart by a stingray in September 2006 – once being one of the most well-known faces on American TV with his crocodile hunting series, it might have been thought that whatever Bindi wrote would be welcomed. Her essay was scheduled to be published in the December issue of Mrs Clinton's e-journal titled Go Wild Coming Together for Conservation as part of the Secretary of State's endangered species initiative. After Bindi submitted her . carefully-prepared work to the US, it was returned to her for her final . approval – with large amounts edited out. Defending her daughter: Bindi's mother, Terri (left), pictured with husband Steve before his death in 2006, said her daughter was less than impressed with the treatment she had received from the U.S. State Department . She had angled her essay on the . problems the world faces with a growing population, comparing it to . throwing a party and having too many guests turn up for everyone to be . fed. 'How is it possible that our fragile planet can sustain these masses of people?' she wrote. Bindi's mother, Mrs Terri Irwin, widow . of the crocodile hunter, told Sydney's Daily Telegraph that her . daughter was less than impressed with the treatment she had received . from the US State Department. 'It's interesting that she was asked . to write an essay about the environment and included the consideration . of population (growth) and they returned her essay edited and complete . edited that out.' Larger than life: Mr Irwin, who was known for his bravery in the face of crocodiles, died in 2006 after being pierced in the chest by a stingray barb . Mrs Irwin, who is American by birth, said Bindi wrote to Hillary Clinton's organisation later asking 'What happened to freedom of speech? This is my opinion and I don't want that edited out.' Bindi, who, like her father before her, has soared to popularity in the US with her own TV show based on conservation, refused to allow the edited essay to go into print. Aware that she might have raised the eyebrows of Mrs Clinton herself with her refusal to allow her essay to be published, Bindi is holding her ground. 'She just wanted her whole essay to be printed rather than just a snippet of it,' said a spokesman for the Australia Zoo in Queensland, where Bindi lives. Mrs Irwin said that population growth was an unpopular topic – 'I just think it's fascinating that when Bindi does an interview and talks about population, more than 50 per cent of the time it's edited out.' Bindi's essay has been published in full on Australian news website and can be read in full at: News.com.au. She wrote: . 'I believe that most problems in the world today, such as climate change, stem from one immense problem which seems to be the 'elephant in the room' that no-one wants to talk about. 'This problem is our ever expanding human population. We are experiencing Earth's sixth mass extinction right now. 'Keep in mind that the previous five were caused by things like asteroid impacts or volcanic eruptions. 'I once had a friend who lived to be 104 years old. Ruth was a remarkable woman who experienced so much in her life time. 'When she was born there was no such thing as sliced bread, zippers or even plastic. Ruth did not see a car until she was ten years old. 'However, to me the most astonishing fact is that when Ruth was born there were 1.5billion people on the planet. 'In one woman's lifetime, the human population increased by more than 5 billion people. These are truly overwhelming figures. 'I must ask this question, how is it possible that our fragile planet can sustain these masses of people? 'Think of it this way. Pretend for a moment that I'm having a party, inviting 15 of my closest friends. 'I've rented a room big enough to fit 15 people, I've bought 15 sandwiches for each of my friends to eat, and I have put together 15 party bags, one for each friend. 'My party is about to start, and I hear a knock at the door. My friends are here! 'Only, when I open the door, 70 of my friends are standing there wanting to come to the party! What can I do? 'The room is only big enough to fit 15, with 70 we won't have any room to move and dance. 'I don't have enough food. Do I divide the sandwiches among the 70 people? But then everyone will still be hungry. 'What about the party bags? Do I only give part bags out to my closes friends? Isn't that unfair to everyone else? 'THAT is the crisis facing mother earth today.'","Teenager furious that essay for Clinton's e-journal was reworked by editors .

"A church tried to teach its youth group a lesson by staging a raid in which unsuspecting teens were ‘kidnapped’ at gunpoint, forced into a van and made to watch one of their pastors being assaulted in his house. The 'lesson,' according to pastors at the Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Middletown, Pennsylvania, was meant to teach them about what Christian missionaries are subjected to in other parts of the world. However, at least one girl, 14, was bruised and battered after the object lesson, and has now filed a complaint with the police. Scroll down for video . Raided: Leaders at the Glad Tidings Assembly of God staged a raid during a youth group meeting last week, but failed to tell the teens it was staged . Bruised: The girl, 14, said she was hurt during the raid, displaying purple bruises on her arms and legs . The girl, who has asked to remain anonymous, described her terror to abc27.com: 'They pulled my chair out from underneath me, and then they told me to get on the ground,' she told the station. 'I had my hands behind my back. They said, `Just do as I say, and you won't be hurt.'’ The girl said she and about 17 other teens were taken to the pastor's house, where it appeared he was being assaulted, covered in what looked to be blood. Eventually, she said, the adults in charge revealed it was a staged event. One of the two ‘kidnappers’ was an off-duty police officer who was carrying a real gun, according to abc27.com. However, the gun was unloaded at the time of the raid. The girl was shocked that no one told her and the rest of the youth group the raid was only a drill. 'They heard me crying,' the girl said. 'Why not right then and there tell us it was a joke, when you see me crying?' Glad Tidings Assembly of God’s pastor, John Lanza, told the Associated Press that the church is 'so saddened' that the girl was traumatized at the Wednesday evening youth meeting. Kidnapped: The teens were shoved into these church vans and driven to the pastor's house . Learning exercise: Pastor John Lanza said the staged abduction was meant to show them what sort of persecution Christians face in other parts of the world . But he said his intent was never harmful – instead, it was designed to prepare them for what they might encounter as missionaries. Lanza didn't disclose the names of those involved but said the mock kidnappers included an off-duty police officer and a retired Army captain. 'It was a youth event, to illustrate what others have encountered on a regular basis,' he said, adding that the focus of the lesson was 'the persecuted church' in other countries. Lanza said there were about 17 students at the meeting and the mock kidnappers covered the students' heads, put them in a van and interrogated them. Neither the students nor their parents were told about the raid beforehand, he said, though it was discussed with the parents of one youth who might have health issues. Lanza said the church has conducted similar events at least twice before, adding that 'there was much thought given to the safety aspect.' 'If anyone was ever uncomfortable, they would be removed' from the exercise, Lanza said, though part of the idea was to shock the students with the experience. In the future: Lanza says: 'I would find a way that we could continue to keep the shock value,' he said, 'but I would find a way to inform the parents (beforehand)' Lower Swatara Township police Chief Richard Wiley declined to comment until an investigation into the raid is complete. The names of the mother and daughter who complained haven't been made public. There could be consequences if the teens didn't know what was going to happen and didn't agree to be a part of the event, Dauphin County First Deputy District Attorney Fran Chardo said. One security expert told the Associated Press that role-playing . training is sometimes conducted 'at the quasi-military level' for . groups that are going to work in war zones. Daniel . Karson, chairman of business intelligence and investigations at Kroll, a . worldwide risk consulting company with headquarters in New York, said . the idea of conflict zone training 'is to acclimate someone to a . possible situation that might arise.' The . training might involve everything from what items they should take to . the country to a review of who they're meeting and security conditions . there, he said. Tom Copeland, who studies international affairs and terrorism at Geneva College, a Beaver Falls school that emphasizes a 'Christian worldview,' questioned the wisdom of submitting a youth group to a mock kidnapping. 'It just seems inappropriate for that age group. You would think there would be permission from the parents,' Copeland said, adding that he's never heard of anything like that happening at a church. He said that while there have been highly publicized episodes of violence directed against Christian missionaries in other countries, it seems those countries' local religious groups are more at risk. Lanza said members of the church have made numerous mission trips overseas and have learned to be cautious. He said they were planning a trip to Mexico but reviewed current news and advisories and decided it was unsafe. Lanza said he 'would love to' apologize to the girl and her mother but feels he can't until the police investigation is done. He said the church wants to keep doing the program but would make changes. 'I would find a way that we could continue to keep the shock value,' he said, 'but I would find a way to inform the parents (beforehand).'

"A jihadist group in Syria has publicly executed and crucified eight rebels fighting both President Bashar al-Assad's regime and the jihadists, a monitor said today. The report comes amid fierce clashes on the outskirts of Damascus between ISIS, which is spearheading a major offensive in Iraq, and rebels, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. ISIS 'executed eight men in Deir Hafer in the east of Aleppo province’ yesterday because they belonged to rebel groups that had fought against the jihadists as well as Assad's forces, it said. Scroll down for video . Blast: Free Syrian Army fighters launch a locally made weapon towards forces loyal to Syria's president Bashar Al-Assad on Al-Hamidiyeh front in southern Idlib countryside . Weapons: Another view of Free Syrian Army fighters launching a mortar shell. Syria's war began as a peaceful movement in March 2011 demanding political change . ISIS then ‘crucified them in the main . square of the village, where their bodies will remain for three days’, . the Britain-based monitor said. Also . in Aleppo province, a ninth man was crucified for eight hours as a form . of punishment in Al-Bab town near the border with Turkey. He survived . the ordeal. ISIS first . emerged in Syria's war in late spring last year and was initially . welcomed by some Syrian rebels who believed its combat experience would . help topple Assad. But subsequent abuses quickly turned the Syrian opposition, including Islamists, against the group. Rebels . launched a major anti-ISIS offensive in January 2014, and have pushed . them out of large swathes of Aleppo province and all of Idlib in the . northwest. However, ISIS . remains firmly rooted in Raqa, its northern Syrian headquarters, and . wields significant power in Deir Ezzor in the east near the border with . Iraq. Arsenal: Free Syrian Army fighters prepare locally made shells on Al-Hamideyeh front in southern Idlib countryside . Mortar shell: The peaceful movement that started three years ago became an armed insurgency when Assad's regime unleashed a brutal crackdown . Activists say the group's Iraq offensive and capture of heavy weapons - some of them US-made - appears to have boosted its confidence in Syria. Until recently, the regime had rarely targeted ISIS bastions, but ever since the jihadists' Iraq offensive, the air force has intensified its strikes against ISIS areas. ‘On Sunday, there were intense air raids on Raqa and Buseira’ in Deir Ezzor, Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman said. ‘It appears Assad's regime wants to make the United States, which fears ISIS's advances, see it as a partner in the war on terror,’ he told AFP. Nonetheless, most of the victims in the air strikes in recent days, ‘some 80 percent’, have been civilians, Abdel Rahman added. War: Free Syrian Army fighters walk with their weapons on Al-Hamidiyeh front in southern Idlib countryside . East of Damascus, ‘fierce clashes broke out early Sunday between rebels from the Army of Islam and ISIS near the town of Hammuriyeh’, the Observatory said. The Army of Islam is a major component of the Islamic Front, Syria's largest rebel coalition which has been fighting ISIS for months, but such fighting in Damascus province is unprecedented. Regime soldiers and warplanes backed by Lebanon's Shiite Hezbollah, meanwhile, pounded rebel positions near the capital, said the Local Coordination Committees activist network. Syria's war began as a peaceful movement in March 2011 demanding political change, but became an armed insurgency when Assad's regime unleashed a brutal crackdown. Many months into the fighting, jihadists began to flock to Syria where upwards of 162,000 people have been killed and millions displaced in more than three years of conflict.","Eight executed in Deir Hafer, Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says .

"A South African student newspaper caused a racial storm after publishing a poll that said white people are the most attractive race. The University of Cape Town’s (UCT) Varsity newspaper conducted a survey of 60 students to decide which race is the most attractive. It showed that 38 per cent of those surveyed thought that whites were the most attractive, while Africans had the lowest rating with just eight per cent. Outrage: White people were found to be the most attractive with 38 per cent of the vote, while African people came last with just eight per cent . The survey took in a wide range of ethnicities, with people from who were white, Indian, East Asian, mixed race, black or ‘coloured’ backgrounds. The poll, which was conducted to accompany an article entitled ‘Is Love Colour Blind’ by student Qamran Tabo, has been condemned as racist. The paper was forced to apologise after students and human rights activists complained. The UCT Young Communist League of South Africa lodged a complaint with the country’s Human Rights Commission as they believe that the ‘charade of a survey’ incited racial hatred. They said: ‘The article and its alleged survey were always leading to inculcate a culture of one race being the jewel of all others. It is despicable to read.’ The university, which is considered among the best in Africa, only chose to remove its race-based admissions policy in February. Academic: The University of Cape Town is considered one of the best universities in Africa . The UCT Student Representative Council said that they paper should have showed greater respect to an issue that had a ‘painful historical significance’. Even South African human rights activist Zackie Achmat tweeted that the poll was ‘racist nonsense’. Critics took to Twitter to condemn the article.

She said: ‘I am aware of the controversy surrounding the sensitivity of race and I understand that the right to freedom of expression has its limits when used unnecessarily to discriminate against others, slandering religion, race, sexuality. ‘However, Varsity feels that the writer was not abusing this right nor had the intention of issuing an attack on individual racial groups, but simply pinpointing a matter that is still affecting the lives of South Africans.’","University of Cape Town student newspaper Varsity conducted the poll .

But according to a new book, the Prime Minister does not find it difficult to switch off from the pressures of leading the country - karaoke, snooker, tennis against a machine dubbed 'the Clegger' and three or four glasses of wine at Sunday lunch, are just a few of the ways Mr Cameron spends his downtime. In the biography of the Prime Minister and his life at his country retreat Chequers, an ally is quoted  admitting: 'If there was an Olympic gold medal for ‘chillaxing’, he would win it.' Chillaxing: A new book claims Mr Cameron has a machine that fires tennis balls at him, which he has nicknamed 'the Clegger' after his victorious battle against the Deputy Prime Minister during the General Elections . Lap of luxury: Prime Minister's country retreat Chequers where he enjoys karaoke, snooker and three or four glasses of wine at Sunday lunch . The Prime Minister’s leisure habits have been seen by some as a sign of a lack of application. Some Tory MPs say he should spend more time sorting out the run of problems which have plagued the Government in recent months as opinion polls continue falling. Mr Cameron has been dubbed 'DVD Dave' with recent photographs taken inside his Downing Street flat showing the couple had 24, Desperate ­Housewives and Band of Brothers in their box set collection. He was also mocked this week for being pictured enjoying a swanky meal with his wife Samantha on one of their weekly 'date nights.' The book reveals that one the first Christmas since he moved into Downing Street, Mr Cameron's friends gave him a karaoke machine which is now at the house and he invites friends over for game of snooker. There is a machine that fires tennis balls, which he has nicknamed 'the Clegger' after his victorious battle against the Deputy Prime Minister in the 2010 General Elections. The book, Cameron: Practically a Conservative, serialised in The Times tells how Mr Cameron flicks through the papers early on a Sunday morning and spends his time at his computer. His afternoon consists of 'a crap film on telly, play with the children, cook, have three or four glasses of wine with lunch, have an afternoon nap, play tennis, according to a friend quoted in the newspaper. Storm brewing: The revelation that Prime Minister David Cameron spends long periods playing games on his iPad will not go down well with the unhappy electorate . Slicing through it: Critics claim Mr Cameron seems more bothered about slicing fruit in the platform game Fruit Ninja than dealing with Britain's increasing economic problems . Michael Gove, the Education Secretary and a family friend, told the authors: 'He is the model of how to have a clear divide between the world of work and then relaxation so you can clear your mind. There are very few people who have such a finely developed capacity to do that.' The book also reveals Mr Cameron can often be found surfing political betting websites. It also discloses his intense dislike of people clicking pens and checking phones during meetings and how his friend of 20 years and policy guru Steve Hilton believes that Mr Cameron had become too power hungry and has compromised his early ambitions for the demands of the coalition and Whitehall. Mr Cameron's aides have stated the idea of Mr Cameron spending a disproportionate amount of time relaxing are grossly unfair. But yesterday, Mr Cameron was forced into frantic denials over bizarre claims that he spends a ‘crazy and scary’ amount of time playing computer games on his iPad. The Prime Minister, a fan of Apple’s trendy tablet computer, is said to be obsessed with the cult game Fruit Ninja, in which players swipe their fingers across a screen to slice through moving images of pieces of melon, orange and pineapple. Date night Dave: Mr Cameron was mocked this week for being pictured enjoying a swanky meal with his wife Samantha on one of their weekly 'date nights' Despite the economic crisis – not to mention the demands of raising three young children – Mr Cameron is said to spend hours tinkering with his iPad and playing computer games. Yesterday Fraser Nelson, editor of the respected and pro-Conservative Spectator magazine, suggested that what was harmless fun had become an obsession. He said a senior adviser to Mr Cameron had told him the Prime Minister spends ‘a crazy, scary amount of time playing Fruit Ninja on his iPad’. Mr Nelson suggested the Prime Minister should ‘turn off the iPad and start dealing with our debt’. Downing Street last night flatly denied the claim, saying it was one of Mr Cameron’s children – aged eight, six and 21 months – who played the game. A source said: ‘It is absolutely not true that the Prime Minister plays Fruit Ninja.’ But Mr Cameron has himself admitted to dabbling with the game, saying it helps him cope with the everyday stress of life in Downing Street. Indeed, he told an interviewer earlier this year: ‘It’s quite good, to get your frustration out. If you can’t have a reshuffle, play Fruit Ninja.’ The Prime Minister has also said that computer games can help him relax during long journeys. What's he up to? Pictured at his home, is Cameron checking up with government work, or playing games aimed at a younger audience? Last night former Labour minister John Spellar said it was astonishing that Mr Cameron could find time to play computer games at all, given the scale of the problems facing Britain. The MP said: ‘Anyone who has ever been a minister knows that the pressures on your time are intense – and that is only a fraction of the time pressure faced by a prime minister. ‘It is a round-the-clock job and I think it is frankly extraordinary that he is wasting time on computer games when Britain is in the throes of an international economic crisis. ‘Instead of trying to show that he is down with the kids he should be getting on with the job.’ Mr Cameron is thought to have taken up Fruit Ninja after completing the hit game Angry Birds. In a separate interview earlier this year the Prime Minister admitted that he found Angry Birds ‘addictive’, but denied it was taking up too much of his time. He said: ‘It is quite addictive, but I want to reassure you I don’t spend a huge amount of time on it. ‘Sometimes on these long flights, when you have done all your  work, you have had all your conversations and prepared all your speeches, you need something to relax with. ‘Sometimes I watch a bit of television, sometimes I play a bit of Angry Birds.’ Mr Cameron is also known to have become increasingly reliant on his iPad. He has ordered civil servants to create an application for the device to keep him informed of breaking news and the performance of government departments and ministers. The £20,000 app will also produce data on polling, unemployment figures, NHS waiting lists and movements in the markets. It will also give ‘real time’ feeds from Twitter and news websites so the Prime Minister can keep up to date with events in the UK and around the world.","Book reveals how Mr Cameron has a karaoke machine at his country retreat Chequers and invites friends over for a game of snooker .

"Anti-Semitism: Salah near his temporary home in London . Strolling in the sunshine, seemingly without a care in the world, this is the Islamic extremist who has made a mockery of Britain’s border controls. In an extraordinary immigration farce, Sheikh Raed Salah is free to walk the streets after he was released on bail. Four weeks ago, the leader of the Islamic Movement in Israel was able to enter the country unchallenged, despite a banning order. Now Salah, who has been accused in Parliament of ‘virulent anti-Semitism’, is using the Human Rights Act to demand his right to stay, and preach, in the UK. He has a return plane ticket but while his legal challenge is being resolved he can stay in the country. Salah is claiming efforts to remove him are in breach of Article 10 of the Human Rights Act, the right to free speech. The Home Office is intent on deporting him on the grounds that his presence is ‘not conducive to the public good’. But lawyers for Salah claim kicking him out is a breach of his right to freedom of expression. In effect he is arguing it would be wrong to revoke his visa and to remove him from the country because it prevents him from preaching. He has already cost the taxpayer thousands of pounds in court and prison costs and the bill is set to rise further during a lengthy court battle. Salah, who was invited to Britain by Left-wing Labour MPs, was in the country for three days before he was arrested, during which time he addressed two large meetings of supporters. On June 25 he arrived at Heathrow from Tel Aviv. Only days earlier Home Secretary Theresa May had issued an order banning him from entering the country. But the papers were never served on him by UK Border Agency officials, and when he landed at Heathrow was able to walk through unhindered on a six-month visitor visa. He then addressed supporters in central London and Leicester before he was finally arrested. He was held at an immigration removal centre, refused to fly home on his return ticket and has rejected offers of flights home. He is now staying at a five-bedroom detached house in a leafy suburb in North London while his case is processed. Last night Douglas Murray, associate director of think-tank the Henry Jackson Society, said the case showed Britons were being ‘taken for mugs’ by extremists. ‘It is yet another demonstration that Britain has become the retirement place of choice and destination for any crazed extremist who wants to be here,’ he said. Salah, 52, who was banned on the grounds of ‘unacceptable behaviour’, is credited with a string of extremist statements, although he denies he is anti-Semitic or an extremist. He is said to have claimed the 9/11 plot was carried out by Israelis and Jews were warned not to go to the World Trade Centre in advance of the murderous attack. He was released from prison in 2005 after serving two years for fundraising for the Palestinian terror group Hamas and for having contact with an Iranian spy. He arrived in Britain only days after Mrs May launched a new strategy aimed at restricting the opportunities for extremists to spread hate-fuelled speech in the UK. She was said to be ‘incandescent’ at the blunder by immigration officials and has ordered a full investigation into what went wrong. Ten days ago the High Court approved bail on a surety of £30,000 on condition that he report to police every day, refrain from preaching, live at a specific address and obey a curfew. The judge, Mr Justice Stadlen, said Salah had a ‘good arguable case’ for judicial review. The case will go to the Court of Appeal today where the Home Office will argue for bail to be revoked. Ministers are still determined to kick him out, a Home Office spokesman said, adding: ‘We were very disappointed with the court’s decision to grant bail and have appealed. We are still seeking to deport Salah.’","Leader of the .

"On a cold and rainy November morning, farmers Mary Carpenter and Paul Dench-Layton waded arm-in-arm into the large soggy paddock that's home to their Broad Breasted Whites, nearly 250 gobbling, barking, and bumbling Thanksgiving turkeys. The husband-and-wife team that owns and operates Violet Hill Farm, a 200-acre spread nestled in upstate New York's Mohawk Valley, began catching the birds by hand days ahead of the year's busiest market week. Together, with their two young children close by, they worked around the clock to slaughter and dress the animals before a four-hour drive south to Manhattan's Union Square Market. There, loyal customers eagerly awaited their organic, non-GMO fed gobblers. Scroll down for video .

This year's lot sold out well before anyone thought to pre-heat their ovens. The work is back-breaking and time is short, but for the farmers it is worth it. 'The market for me, that's my reset button, because it can get so stressful and overwhelming and exhausting,' said Carpenter. 'We go to the market and we have people who bring their families to come meet their farmers. It is like an extended family. It sounds cliche and hokey, but it really does become that. You know a lot about your customers and they show you pictures and they know your kids' names.' Buyers say knowing the people who grow their food makes a difference. 'When you shop at the same vendor for the same thing all the time, you start to develop a connection,' said Karma Hara, one of Violet Hill's regular and enthusiastic customers. 'I get an email every year, three weeks before Thanksgiving. . Mary has my email address, and many other people's too, but it feels personal, and she sends an email and it says ""OK we're starting to take deposits for turkey now,"" and I don't get that email from Whole Foods ... and I wouldn't give my email to Whole Foods.' But bottom line is the taste. Is fully-pastured fresh turkey really all that different? 'I originally tried one of their chickens and it was probably the best chicken I've had, ever, and so I started shopping for chicken from them and then they offered turkeys that first year. I ordered one, and the rest is history,' said Hara. 'I buy my turkey from them every year. Even if I travel for Thanksgiving, then I just cook Thanksgiving early on the Saturday before.'

"Women taking a daily dose of calcium have a 22 percent cut in death risk, but no statistical benefit was shown for men . Taking a calcium supplement of up to 1,000 mg per day can help women live longer, say researchers. A new study shows a 22 per cent lower risk of dying over a 10-year period compared with women who are not taking supplements regularly. The study is likely to reassure many who take supplements either prescribed by their doctor for osteoporosis - thinning bones - or bought over the counter as 'bone insurance'. Previously there have been fears that high-dose supplements could raise the risk of dying from heart disease. But Canadian researchers behind the latest study are unequivocal in recommending extra calcium for women with low intakes. Lead author David Goltzman, of McGill University in Montreal, said 'Our study found daily use of calcium supplements was associated with a lower risk of death among women. 'The benefit was seen for women who took doses of up to 1,000 mg per day, regardless of whether the supplement contained vitamin D.' according to a recent study accepted for publication in The Endocrine Society's Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (JCEM). The researchers analysed data from the large-scale Canadian Multicentre Osteoporosis Study which monitored the health of 9,033 Canadians between 1995 and 2007. During that period, 1,160 participants died. The findings show a 22 per cent cut in risk of death for women using calcium supplements compared with non-users, but no statistical benefit for men. The study found no conclusive evidence that taking vitamin D had an impact on death rates. There appeared to be no benefit from taking calcium at doses bigger than 1,000mg a day. Dr Golzman said 'Higher amounts of calcium were potentially linked to longer lifespans in women, regardless of the source of the calcium. 'That is, the same benefits were seen when the calcium came from dairy foods, non-dairy foods or supplements. 'Our recommendation would be to assess dietary intake to meet calcium and vitamin D requirements for bone health and to consider supplementation as necessary to meet the requirements.' The study, which is to be published in . the Endocrine Society's Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & . Metabolism, suggests several possible mechanisms for promoting longer . life. Calcium supplements are linked to a . better balance of blood fats, lower risk of high blood pressure, better . bone metabolism and bowel health. Health benefits may also be driven by eating more calcium from food within a healthy diet, including dairy products and fish. The same benefits were demonstrated whether calcium came from dairy foods, non-dairy foods or supplements . There have been conflicting results from studies in recent years about the benefits and possible harms of taking calcium supplements, especially more than 1,000mg a day. Scientists believe mega doses of calcium circulating in the blood have a 'flooding effect' which may lead to hardening of the arteries and heart attacks. In contrast, dietary calcium is taken in small amounts spread throughout the day, so is absorbed slowly. The Food Standards Agency recommends adults have 700mg of calcium a day, which should come from dietary sources including all types of milk, cheese, yoghurts and green, leafy vegetables. Official figures suggest women consume only 740mg of calcium per day from food sources on average - 43mg lower than in 2000-1. Carrie Ruxton, spokesperson for the Health Supplements Information Service, said it was likely that women taking extra calcium were reaping the benefits of having an optimal supply of the mineral. She said: 'Men tend to get a bigger intake from their diet but many women don't consume as much, especially those cutting back on dairy products. 'The benefits found in this study could be from women having extra supplies, bringing them up to normal and optimal levels.' She said there were subtle effects on metabolism apart from calcium's bone-building qualities, including regulation of appetite and weight. But the direct effects of helping to prevent the consequences of osteoporosis such as falls and hip fractures should not be under-estimated.","Women taking up to 1,000 mg calcium per day had lower mortality rates .

"A sensational new theory about the Turin Shroud claims to destroy the core belief of Christianity - that Jesus Christ rose from the dead. Art historian Thomas de Wesselow is convinced the Shroud is real and did touch Christ's body. But the Cambridge academic insists that the image on the cloth fooled the Apostles into believing Christ had come back to life, and the Resurrection was in fact an optical illusion. Theory: While Cambridge academic Thomas de Wesselow believes the shroud is real, he claims the image of Christ fooled the apostles into believing he had risen from the dead . If true, this radically reshapes the version of the events which led to the birth of Christianity as a world religion, now followed by more than two billion people. His theory is that in the mind of a person 2,000 years ago, the image on the Shroud would have been astonishing - far beyond their normal experiences and truly unsettling. 'They saw the image on the cloth as the living double of Jesus,' he said. Illusion? The image of Christ as it appears on the shroud. Christians believe it was the burial cloth that wrapped Christ's body after the crucifixion . 'Back then images had a psychological presence, they were seen as part of a separate plain of existence, as having a life of their own.' 'If you think yourself into the whole . experience of the apostles. Going into the tomb three days after the . crucifixion, in the half-light, and seeing that image emerging from the . burial cloth,' the 40-year-old academic told The Daily Telegraph. According to the Bible, Peter, James, Thomas, Mary Magdalene and a number of disciples saw Jesus in the flesh after his death. This proved he was the son of God and became the central tenet of Christian faith and theology. Belief: The resurrection as portrayed by Renaissance master Piero della Francesca in 1460 . In the New Testament, after the Romans crucified Jesus, he was buried in a tomb, but God raised him from the dead and he appeared to many people over a span of forty days before his ascension to Heaven. Christians celebrate the resurrection of Jesus on Easter Sunday, the third day after Good Friday, the day of his crucifixion. The resurrection story appears in more than five locations in the Bible. But De Wesselow - a self-confessed 'shroudie' who has been intrigued by the its mystery since childhood - has a radically different view. He has spent eight years on The Sign: The Shroud of Turin and the Secret of the Resurrection, due to be published next Monday. It is the latest in a long list of works claiming to have solved the riddle of the Turin Shroud. In 1988 the Holy See, which controls access to the artifact, allowed radiocarbon dating on portions of a swatch taken from a corner of the shroud. Independent tests in 1988 at the University of Oxford, the University of Arizona, and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology concluded that the shroud material dated to 1260–1390 AD, with 95 per cent confidence. These dates corresponded with the first appearance of the shroud in church history. The tests were criticised, with some saying the sample taken for analysis may have been a part repaired in the medieval period. But others insist this answers the mystery of the Shrouds origins and authenticity. But in December 2011, physicist Giulio Fanti published a critical compendium of the major hypotheses regarding the formation of the body image on the shroud. He stated that 'none of them can completely explain the mysterious image'. Many believe the linen cloth was the shroud in which Jesus Christ's body was buried after it was cut from the crucifix on Calvary, and displays an image of his body. But debate has raged for decades about its authenticity. Since a 1988 radiocarbon dating test put its age at between 1260 and 1390, many have just assumed the Shroud, which is held in the Royal Chapel of the Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist in Turin, northern Italy, is a medieval forgery. But conclusive proof has not yet been advanced. De Wesselow's new book claims to prove the botched sampling of the cloth and the last-minute abandonment of agreed procedures mean that the carbon dating test was seriously flawed. De Wesselow, who is based in King's College, Cambridge, believes the Shroud was looted as bounty by French knights and the Crusaders who sacked Constantinople in 1204. He is convinced modern analysis proves the Shroud is genuine; that pollens lifted from cloth fibres indicate that it was once in Israel; a seam used in the weave of the linen is identical to one found only on a first-century cloth from Judea; the wound-marks are composed of real blood; and an alternative, peer-reviewed test of the age of the linen found that it was over 1300 years old. He contends that the negative quality of the image also explains why, in the Gospels, the disciples are at first unable to recognize the Risen Jesus . And he says his version of the Resurrection can be interpreted from passages in the Bible. He points to Saint Paul's 1 Corinthians 15-50 in which the Apostle says unequivocally that 'resurrection is not about flesh and blood'.","Cambridge academic claims Resurrection was an optical illusion .

"Police called in the bomb squad yesterday after a three-year-old boy was spotted standing on a live hand grenade during an Easter egg hunt.

They then slowly moved the children away from the scene, keeping calm in order not to panic them. When they arrived on the scene, police officers put a 100-metre cordon in place and alerted members of the Army's Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) team, who rushed straight to the scene.

"Former President Bill Clinton may have a reputation as a  lady's man, but there is one woman who it seems was not as never won over by that famous charm of his. In an oral history project on the Clinton White House being released this month by the University of Virginia former Hillary Clinton aide Susan Thomases reveals that she made it very clear to President Clinton on the campaign trail that she would put up with no nonsense. And that meant, above all else, no sex with other women. Scroll down for video . In charge: Susan Thomases (on right, with Chief of Staff for Hillary Clinton Maggie Williams on left) has revealed that she told Bill Clinton there were to be no affairs when she worked as a Hillary Clinton aide . Under control: Thomases says her speech worked, and that President Clinton had no sex with other women while campaigning to be president in 1992 . 'I told him if I found him having sex on the campaign, he was dead, that I was leaving and taking everybody with me,' says Thomases according to the New York Post. 'I said, ""You’re stupid enough to blow this whole presidential thing over your d**k. And if that turns out to be true, buddy, I’m going home, and I’m taking people with me. If you don’t have enough self-control to keep yourself straight, then it’s just dumb."" ' In the end, Thomases' threat ended up working wonders it seems, at least during the campaign, as she says President Clinton was 'straight as could be.' Thomases would make such an impact on the campaign trail back in 1992, that she even wound up as a character in the wildly popular book, and then film, Primary Colors, with her name changed to Lucille Kaufmann. Back at it: President Clinton may need another speech from Thomases if his wife Hillary decided to run in 2016 . These days, the 70-year-old Thomases is not working and living in New York, being forced to retire from her career as an attorney when she developed multiple sclerosis a few years back. That may all change should Hillary decide to run for president however, and President Clinton needs another pep talk. 'Sometimes you have to be that blunt, and he gets it,' says Thomases of laying down the law with the former Commander in Chief. 'That’s not a long speech. It takes all of about 30 seconds.'","Hillary Clinton aide Susan Thomases has shared stories of some of her experiences while working on President Clinton's 1992 campaign .

"They say silence is golden – but there’s a room in the U.S that’s so quiet it becomes unbearable after a short time. The longest that anyone has survived in the ‘anechoic chamber’ at Orfield Laboratories in South Minneapolis is just 45 minutes. It’s 99.99 per cent sound absorbent and holds the Guinness World Record for the world’s quietest place, but stay there too long and you may start hallucinating. Earth's quietest place: The 'anechoic chamber' at Orfield Laboratories, which is 99.99 per cent sound absorbent and capable of giving you hallucinations . The Anechoic Test Chamber at Orfield Laboratories was deemed the quietest place on Earth in 2004 - a record it still holds to this day . It achieves its ultra-quietness by virtue of 3.3-foot-thick fiberglass acoustic wedges, double walls of insulated steel and foot-thick concrete. The company’s founder and president, Steven Orfield, told MailOnline: ‘We challenge people to sit in the chamber in the dark - one reporter stayed in there for 45 minutes. ‘When it’s quiet, ears will adapt. The quieter the room, the more things you hear. You'll hear your heart beating, sometimes you can hear your lungs, hear your stomach gurgling loudly. ‘In the anechoic chamber, you become the sound.’ And this is a very disorientating experience. Mr Orfield explained that it’s so disconcerting that sitting down is a must. He said: ‘How you orient yourself is through sounds you hear when you walk. In the anechnoic chamber, you don't have any cues. You take away the perceptual cues that allow you to balance and manoeuvre.

Orfield said: ‘It's used for formal product testing, for research into . the sound of different things - heart valves, the sound of the display . of a cellphone, the sound of a switch on a car dashboard.’ Silence is not so golden: The longest anyone has lasted sitting alone in the dark in the chamber is 45 minutes . It’s also put to use to determine sound quality. Mr Orfield and his team will help companies such as washing-machine maker Whirlpool develop metaphors for what sound should, well, sound like. Motorbike maker Harley-Davidson used the lab, for instance, to make their bikes quieter, while still sounding like Harley-Davidsons. ‘We record products and people listen to them based on semantic terms, like “expensive”, “low quality”, said Mr Orfield. ‘We measure their feelings and associations.’ Nasa, meanwhile, uses a similar chamber to test its astronauts. They are put in a water-filled tank inside the room to see ‘how long it takes before . hallucinations take place and whether they could work through it’. As Mr Orfield explains, space is like one giant anechoic chamber, so it’s crucial that astronauts are able to stay focussed. Mr Orfield admits that he can last a very respectable 30 minutes in his chamber, despite having an off-putting mechanical heart valve that suddenly becomes very loud indeed once he's inside.","Orfield Laboratories' 'anechoic chamber' in the U.S is 99.99% sound absorbent .

"U.S. special operations forces attempted to rescue an American and Briton held hostage by al-Qaeda during an early morning raid on a cave in Yemen, but the two Westerners had already been moved by the time commandos arrived. News of the pre-dawn Tuesday raid was first reported by the New York Times on Wednesday, which detailed how Americans, including members of the Navy’s SEAL Team Six, worked with Yemeni counterterrorism forces to stage the attack on an al-Qaeda hideout in the Yemeni province of Hadhramaut, near the border with Saudi Arabia. SEAL Team Six is the elite team which participated in the 2012 raid in which former al-Qaeda leader and 9/11 mastermind Osama Bin Laden was assassinated. Eight hostages - including six Yemenis, a Saudi Arabian and an Ethiopian - were rescued in this week's raid. A member of the Yemen special forces confirmed that an unnamed American and Briton were expected to be among the hostages in the remote cave. Covert: A joint team of U.S. special forces and Yemen counterterrorism agents conducted a raid on an al-Qaeda hideout Tuesday, freeing eight hostages. An American and Briton were expected to be among the prisoners, but appear to have been moved shortly before the raid . U.S. officials confirmed that the raid took place, but referred all questions about the operation to the Yemeni government. ‘I would just tell you we continue to support Yemeni counterterrorism efforts and would refer you to them to talk to any operations,’ Rear Admiral John F Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, told reporters on Tuesday. According to the Times, the raid happened in the early hours of Tuesday morning, when about two dozen U.S. special forces and Yemeni soldiers were flown to a dune-filled area called Hagr al-Saiaar. The team then made their way on foot to a cave where the hostages were being held, and engaged in a firefight with members of the group al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). Seven AQAP fighters were killed in the battle, officials said. The soldiers and freed hostages then hiked back to waiting helicopters, and flew out of the rural region overrun by al-Qaeda groups who are protected by the local tribes. The Tuesday operation was the first reported incident where American forces have operated on the ground in Yemen. However, the U.S. military has a strong presence in the country, which has authorized the Pentagon to carry out drone strikes on terrorist groups. So far, the Yemeni government has only confirmed the identity of one of the hostages freed in the raid: Khalil al-Mekhlafi. Al-Meklafi, a lecturer at Yemen’s Al Bayda University who holds a doctorate in computer science, and two of his colleagues were abducted last year after finishing classes at the school. Professor Sailan Al Arami, president of the Al Bayda, said al-Meklafi was hired by the university last year after serving for months at a police academy. A local journalist told the Times that al-Meklafi was likely abducted by al-Qaeda militants, who thought his time as a police officer made him knowledgeable in how to make explosives. ‘They think that he would help them making bombs,’ the journalist, who asked to remain anonymous, told the Times. The Saudi Arabian hostage has also not been identified yet, but it is alleged that it could be diplomat Abdullah al-Khalidi. Free? Six Yemenis, an Ethiopian and a Saudi Arabian were freed in the raid. The Saudi Arabian hostage has not been identified but could be diplomat Abdullah al-Khalidi (pictured left and right). Al-Khalidi was kidnapped in Aden, Yemen in 2012, and has appeared in al-Qaeda videos pleading for his release (a grab of one of the videos on the right) Al-Khalidi was kidnapped from the Yemeni city of Aden in 2012, and has pleaded for his release in videos released by al-Qaeda to the Saudi Arabian government. A spokesman at the Saudi Embassy in Washington told the Times that they had no information about the citizen who was released. This past summer, U.S. special ops participated in a similar raid in Syria, where they failed to rescue American hostages held by the Islamic State, after the extremist group started beheading American journalists and aid workers in videotaped recordings. The identity of the American targeted in the Tuesday raid remains a mystery, since there hasn’t been a report of an American held hostage by AQAP in Yemen.","Tuesday morning raid carried out by two dozen American commandos and Yemeni counterterrorism agents in remote region overrun by al-Qaeda cells .

"A German television drama about the Second World War has sparked outrage in Poland for allegedly trying to spread responsibility for the Holocaust. 'Our Mothers, Our Fathers', which follows the lives of five wartime Germans, shows members of Poland's resistance army shunning Jewish members and failing to help others heading for Auschwitz. In one scene, a partisan boasts 'we drown Jews like rats'. Controversial: Drama 'Our Mothers, Our Fathers' follows the lives of five wartime Germans . Criticism: The Polish ambassador to Berlin has slammed the depiction of Poles as hostile towards Jews in the programme . Changing history? The Polish ambassador said he was 'shocked' by the portrayal of his country's resistance army . Yesterday Poland's ambassador to . Berlin, Jerzy Marganski, slammed the series in a letter sent to German . public television station ZDF, which broadcast the 14 million-euro . production. 'The image of Poland and the Polish . resistance against the German occupiers as conveyed by this series is . perceived by most Poles as extremely unjust and offensive,' Marganski . wrote. 'I, too, am shocked.' Among other criticisms, Marganski said . viewers learn nothing of the Warsaw uprising, in which up to 200,000 . Polish civilians died, nor of the many Poles who helped Jews. He said the programme gave the impression that more people 'were to blame for the destruction of Jews' than just the Germans. Taduesz Filipkowski, spokesman for . the International Home Army Association, a veterans' organisation, also . criticised the German production. 'We are angry with this film's . message,' he told the Daily Telegraph. 'We believe it to be evil slander and an attempt to . justify Nazi crimes by setting them against the alleged anti-Semitism . that existed in Poland before the war. Our government should not ignore . this attack on our reputation.' Producer . Nico Hofmann said the depictions of 'the Polish situation.... are based . on historically vetted material' and there was no intention to defame . the Poles. Despite the criticism, 'Our Mothers, Our Fathers' has proved to be a hit in Germany with as many as seven million viewers tuning into the show. The producer of 'Our Mothers, Our Fathers' said he had been 'historically vetted' and there was no intent to offend Poles . The programme has proved to be a hit in Germany drawing as many as seven million viewers . Hofmann said one of his goals was to . encourage a national debate among the generations 'to speak for the . first time about the experience' of the war. He said the third and final . episode drew a 20.5 percent market share among viewers aged 14-59 . years, which he described as 'extremely high' for ZDF. Many critics have praised the series . as a milestone in Germany's troubled reckoning with its past and an . overdue examination of individual guilt in the war. But the mixed reactions to the series . underscore how, nearly 70 years after the Second World War, the conflict remains . a source of bitterness in Europe, even for people born after the . fighting ended. Since the series aired, newspapers and . online forums have been filled with comments by descendants of the war . generation, with many saying their parents rarely, if ever, spoke of . their experiences. 'I can imagine that in many families . where there are survivors there will be conversations,' said Jens . Wehner, a historian at the German Military Museum in Dresden. 'Soon nobody will be left who experienced . (the war),' warned Frank Schirrmacher, publisher of the conservative . daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. He praised the series 'for the . earnestness, the love of detail and the unwillingness to compromise,' which allowed it to have 'what it takes to touch the soul of the . country.'","'Our Mothers, Our Fathers' shows Polish resistance army shunning Jews .

"The lengths Taliban are prepared to . go to to gain access to coalition forces shown as two militants dressed in women's clothing are arrested . U.S. military commanders in Afghanistan have assigned 'guardian angels' - troops who watch over their comrades even as they sleep - as part of a series of increased security measures to protect troops against possible rogue attacks. The added protections are part of a directive issued in recent weeks by Marine General John Allen, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, to guard against insider threats. And they come in the wake of a spike in attacks on U.S. and coalition forces by Afghans, including the point-blank shooting deaths of two U.S. advisers in Afghanistan's Ministry of Interior. The lengths the Taliban are prepared to . go to in order to gain access to coalition forces was illustrated . yesterday when local police arrested seven men dressed in women's clothing . in Mehterlam, Laghman province, east of Kabul. Disguise: Captured Taliban militants are presented to the media in Mehterlam, east of Kabul, yesterday. Concerned by the increased threat to U.S. forces, military commanders have assigned 'guardian angels' - troops that watch over their comrades even as they sleep - as part of a series of increased security measures . Spectacle: The insurgents dressed as women show the Taliban's determination to infiltrate coalition forces . Tensions have increased in recent . weeks, most noticeably after Staff Sergeant Robert Bales wandered off a . U.S. military base in southern Afghanistan and allegedly killed eight . Afghan adults and nine children. Some of the security changes have been subtle, others not so much. In . several Afghan ministries, Americans are now allowed to carry weapons. And they have been instructed to rearrange their office desks there to . face the door, so they can see who is coming in, said a senior military . official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. While . General Allen did not detail the new measures in a briefing earlier . this week, he acknowledged that changes had been made. He . said: 'We have taken steps necessary on our side to protect ourselves . with respect to, in fact, sleeping arrangements, internal defences . associated with those small bases in which we operate.' He added that now someone is 'always over-watching our forces'. The . security measures came after the U.S. military mistakenly burned Qurans . and other religious materials in February, triggering anti-American . demonstrations and riots. Taking no chances: The coffin of Sergeant William R Wilson III arrives at Dover Air Force Base, Delaware, yesterday. U.S. military commanders in Afghanistan have assigned 'guardian angels' - troops that watch over their comrades even as they sleep - as part of a series of increased security measures . The added protections are part of a directive issued by Marine General John Allen, pictured here during a press conference at the Pentagon on Monday, to guard against insider threats . That same month, two U.S. military . advisers were gunned down at their desks in one of the most heavily . guarded ministry buildings in Kabul. As . a result of the shootings, more than 300 advisers were pulled out of . the Afghan ministries. So far, several dozen have returned, but many . will not go back until additional security measures are put in place by . the Afghans. That would include better vetting procedures, background checks and physical security measures at the ministries. The military official also said some advisers may not return, since commanders have determined that some may no longer be needed in the jobs. The military official said Allen issued the directive 'to get every single troop in the war zone to read it and think' - and to emphasise that troops should be aware of their surroundings as they go about their jobs. Increased tensions: U.S. officials say Staff Sergeant Ribert Bales wandered off base in southern Afghanistan earlier this month and killed eight Afghan adults and nine children . U.S. commanders and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said the killings do not represent a trend, and that less than half of the killings have been by Afghans associated with the Taliban. Instead, General Allen said these types of attacks come with fighting an insurgency and happened in Iraq and Vietnam. The enemy, he said, will do what it can to disrupt efforts to train and grow a nation's indigenous security force. Still, the recent spike in Afghans gunning down troops they are serving alongside reflects increased tensions between the two countries just as the coalition escalates efforts to train Afghans to take over their own security so that most Nato forces can leave by the end of 2014. Officials insist the killings have not hampered the U.S. mission in Afghanistan. But they come at a time when new, small advisory teams are heading into Afghanistan to beef up the training program, requiring them to work closely with Afghan military units. So far this year, 16 Nato service members have been shot and killed by Afghan soldiers and policemen or militants disguised in their uniforms. That equals 18 per cent of the 84 foreign troops killed this year in Afghanistan. Of the approximately 80 Nato service members killed since 2007 by Afghan security forces, more than 75 per cent were in the past two years. In two separate incidents on Monday, Afghan security forces shot and killed one American and two British troops. In one incident, two British service members were killed by an Afghan soldier in front of the main gate of a joint civilian-military base in southern Afghanistan, the coalition said. And in the second, a U.S. service member was shot and killed at a checkpoint in Paktika province in eastern Afghanistan by a man who was believed to be a member of a village-level fighting force the U.S. is fostering in hopes of countering the Taliban insurgency. According to the military official, the so-called guardian angels provide an extra layer of security, watching over the troops as they sleep, when they are exercising, and going about their day. General Allen noted that the Afghans have also taken some similar steps to provide guards for their own forces. The Afghans have also inserted their own intelligence officers into their units to help try and ferret out possible insurgents or rogue soldiers. Since the ministry shooting, the Afghans have taken a number of steps to increase building security in the ministries and to improve the vetting of their workers. General Allen said: 'They are helping the troops to understand how to recognise radicalisation or the emergence of extremism in some of those, in individuals who may in fact be suspect.' He noted that there have also been some arrests by Afghan forces when they identified possible attackers within their ranks.","'Guardian angels' are troops who watch over comrades even as they sleep .

"Thoughts: Osama bin Laden struggled to command the attention of his far-flung terror network . Osama Bin Laden urged followers not to 'waste our effort' with attacks on Britain, but to focus exclusively on defeating America. He plotted to bring down a plane carrying President Obama, claiming it would mean the accession of vice-president Joe Biden, who was 'utterly unprepared' for the job. The revelations emerged in a cache of letters and documents recovered from Bin Laden's hideout in Pakistan and released online yesterday, a year after his death in a raid by US Navy SEALs. They offer a rare insight into his thinking, with one letter drafted just a week before he died. Bin Laden was clear he saw America as his overriding terror target. 'Even though we have the chance to attack the British, we should not waste our effort to do so but concentrate on defeating America, which will lead to defeating the others, God Willing,' he wrote. 'Any arrow and mine we have should be directed against Americans, disregarding all other enemies, including Nato, and concentrating on Americans only.' And his prime target was President Obama. Bin Laden ordered two units to be set up, in Pakistan and Bagram, Afghanistan – the home of a major US base – to attack aircraft carrying Mr Obama and his vice-president. He clearly wanted gaffe-prone Mr Biden in the White House and said 'the killing…would have a serious impact on the course of the war' because Mr Obama was 'the man of this phase'. He ruled out targeting Robert Gates, then US defence secretary or Admiral Mike Mullen, then chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff. But he made it clear Mr Biden was to remain unharmed, so lowly did he rate the vice-president. Scroll down for videos .

Watching: In this undated image from video seized from bin Laden's compound, the Al-Qaeda chief watches a TV programme showing an image of President Obama .

American army vehicles have the least amount of soldiers'. Fox News: '(Fox News) channel... falls into the abyss as you know, and lacks neutrality too.... Let her die in her anger.' CNN: .As for the neutrality of CNN in English, it seems to be in cooperation with the government more than the others (except Fox News of course).' ABC News: 'ABC channel is all right; actually it could be one of the best channels, as far as we are concerned. It is interested in al-Qaeda issues, particularly the journalist Brian Ross, who is specialized in terrorism. The channel is still proud for its interview with the [bin Laden]. It also broadcasted excerpts from a speech of [Gadahn's] on the fourth anniversary.' CBS News: 'I see that it is like the other channels, but it has a famous program (60 Minutes) that has some popularity and a good reputation for its long broadcasting time.' MSNBC: 'I used to think that MSNBC channel may be good and neutral a bit, but is has lately fired two of the most famous journalists - Keith Olberman and Octavia Nasser the Lebanese.' He explained: 'The only time you are . allowed to attack the other army vehicles is if those vehicles are going . to attack our brothers.' In the same undated letter, Bin Laden wrote: 'We want to cut the tree at the root. 'The problem is that our strength is limited, so our best way to cut the tree is to concentrate on sawing the trunk of the tree. 'Here is an example for you, the . mujahidin were able to cut the root of the Russian tree, and after that, . all the branches fell off one after the other.' In another missive written on October . 21 2010, Bin Laden relished the economic problems hurting the West. He . said America was in 'big trouble' in Afghanistan and 'their financial . crisis continues'. 'Britain has lowered its defence . budget and America is reducing the budget of the Pentagon. Anyone who . knows the world and knows politics knows it is impossible for them to . continue with the war,' he states. There are also two references to . Britain in a letter dated April 26, 2011.

"It is a quiz traditionally associated with the finest minds in the country. But media watchdog Ofcom has ruled that Channel 4 was right to brand one Mastermind contestant 'astoundingly thick'. Simon Curtis recorded one of the show’s lowest scores in the history of the programme, but took umbrage when comedian David Walliams mocked him on a comedy show. Struggle: Simon Curtis' appearance on one episode of Mastermind did not go to plan, leading to one of the lowest scores ever and mocking from comedian David Walliams on his show . Curtis was nicknamed 'Disastermind' in his home town of Castleford, West Yorkshire, after his appearance on the BBC1 show in 2006. He scored just one point on his chosen subject - the Hollywood actor Jim Carrey. The 47-year-old claimed he was treated unfairly in an episode of David Walliams’ Awfully Good. Running commentary: Walliams used his show Awfully Good to mock Curtis, claiming that he was 'astoundingly thick' as he spoke over his attempts to answer the questions . The programme, which was shown on Channel 4 in January, included a clip of Mr Curtis on Mastermind which was introduced by Walliams who said: ‘Sometimes in life, you have to know your limitations... if you’re not, let’s say, very bright, it’s probably not a good idea to go on a quiz show that tests your mental agility. ‘And by not very bright I mean, astoundingly thick.’ Walliams then gave a running commentary as Mr Curtis passed on the first questions. The probation worker complained to Ofcom that he was portrayed as being of ‘low intelligence’ and that he had not given his consent for it to be shown. He was also unhappy the show did not mention the clip was from the semi-final of the famous quiz show - which means he had won a previous round. Mr Curtis, who is a self-confessed quiz addict, had already won £250,000 on Who Wants to be a Millionaire? In its defence, Channel 4 said that it was obvious Mr Curtis was not literally ‘astoundingly thick’ as he was on Mastermind in the first place. But it added: 'This was the worst specialist subject performance ever seen on Mastermind.’ Ofcom agreed and refused to uphold any of Mr Curtis’s complaints. It ruled: ‘We recognise that these comments carried the potential to be offensive and insulting to Mr Curtis. ‘However we took the view that it would . have been clear to viewers from the beginning of the programme that Mr . Walliams - himself best known as a comedian - intended to provide . humourous and light hearted opinion and comment on examples of past . television clips.’ Quiz addict: Curtis took umbrage at Walliams because he failed to mention it was a semi-final, meaning he had previously won an episode of the show . Viewers were left stunned by Curtis’ performance on the first round of Mastermind – in which he passed eleven times and got three answers wrong, before securing just one point. He had more success in the general knowledge round and had a final score of eight. Quizmaster John Humphrys said: ‘I think his mind just went blank. You get people who are immensely knowledgeable and then it won’t come. You feel a bit sorry for them.' But Mr Curtis is not the worst performer on Mastermind. Last year Kajen Thuraaisingham, a software analyst, posted the worst total in the show’s 37-year history - a paltry five points. His first round score of four out of 14 on his specialist subject - The Life of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk [founder of modern Turkey] - was followed by just one out of 15 in the general knowledge round. The 28-year-old from London scored two fewer than the previous worst total, passing 11 times and giving 13 wrong answers.","Contestant Simon Curtis said he was 'unfairly treated' by Little Britain star .

"The U.S. military is investigating a photograph that shows a soldier allegedly raising a gay pride flag at a base in Afghanistan. The series of three photographs, which were originally posted on the wall of a Facebook group called ‘Wipeout Homophobia,’ have been incredibly polarising. While the gay community is largely praising the flag-flying, some conservatives are livid, and are saying that U.S. troops are in mortal peril because of it. Flying the flag: A Facebook user named Nicole Jodice posted this image to Wipeout Homophobia and wrote: 'hubbie in afghanistan raising a gay pride flag' Sequence: The three photographs show an unidentified soldier placing the gay pride flag on a pole in what looks like a U.S. military base in Afghanistan . Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, is one of them. He wrote: 'There, in the dusty desert of war, an Army outpost saluted the colours of the homosexual lobby by flying a rainbow flag in place of Old Glory. 'These displays are an uncomfortable reminder of the open policy that few of the troops support.' He placed blame on President Obama, accusing him for being intolerant toward religious freedom. Gay pride: Last week, Norwich University became the first private military academy to host a gay pride week . A woman named Nicole Jodice posted the picture on the group’s Facebook wall on March 24th with a message that read: ‘Hubbie in Afghanistan raising a gay pride flag.’ Conservative: Tony Perkins, President of the Family Research Council . The International Security Assistance Force told Fox News that it is investigating the incident, but said they were unsure where in Afghanistan the flag was raised, who was raising it, and the photograph’s authenticity. Ms Jodice wrote in a follow up note that the picture was not Photoshopped, and thanked people for their support. Mr Perkins compared the flying of the gay flag to the accidental Koran burnings earlier this year. He wrote: ‘After February’s accident with the Korans, American lives were lost. 'What price will we pay because some want to use the military to show their gay pride?’ However, as Queerty.com said, Mr Perkins wasn’t as concerned over the Koran burnings a few weeks ago, saying it ‘doesn’t hold a torch to what’s happening to faith in America.’ The New Civil Rights Movement fired back saying that to Mr Perkins, ‘everything is an attack on Christianity. The mere fact that there are homosexuals in the military, now serving their country openly, is an affront to Perkins’ sense of religious entitlement.’ The gay pride flag, also known as the rainbow flag, is a well-known symbol of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender pride (LBGT). The first known pride flag was made by Gilbert Baker for the San Francisco Gay Freedom Day Parade in 1978.","Photo posted to Facebook group called 'Wipeout Homophobia' on March 24 .

"In the first flush of love, it's perfectly natural to try to spend as much time as you can with that special person. But an American couple took that to the extreme and decided to test the strength of their feelings for each other by spending 48 hours handcuffed together. Mark Malkoff and his wife Christine, from New York, undertook the patience-stretching ordeal to see just how solid their marriage is. Scroll down for video . The ties that bind: Mark Malkoff and his wife Christine spent 48 hours shackled together with handcuffs . Is this a good idea? The couple webchat to a relationship advisor about their strange challenge . Mr Malkoff, a comedian, writer, and filmmaker who formerly worked for Comedy Central's The Colbert Report, and Christine soon learned that even simple tasks like doing the dishes, going for a meal and food shopping suddenly become a test of flexibility and team work when you are shackled together. Even sleeping is incredibly uncomfortable as every shuffle wakes the other person up. And then there's the delicate issue of going to the toilet. Mr Malkoff said: ' Some people feel like they're handcuffed to their spouse. I'm literally going to be handcuffed to mine. We're going to see more of each other than we ever have before.' 'That's not a good thing,' Christine, evidently an understanding woman, deadpans. Synchronised: The couple must employ teamwork to do simple tasks like cleaning their teeth . Mark looks glum as he's forced to follow his wife around as she vacuums . Christine does the washing up and Mark boils the kettle as she cleans . Mark chooses an odd and inconvenient time to practice his juggling . Intimate dinner: The couple have to sit virtually nose-to-nose to eat . And stretch: Christine is taller than Mark, creating some problems . Chin chin: The married couple even have to synchronise their drinking, although it is not known why they don't use their other hands . At the start of the two days of enforced intimacy, the couple spoke to relationship expert Andrea Syrtash. When asked if it's a good idea, she said: 'Actually, I advise couples to take time apart.' 'Yeah, we can't really do that, can we?' Malkoff responds, perhaps unnecessarily. A day after trailing behind his wife as she vacuums, looking glum, struggling to get through doors and numerous other trials, Malkoff began to regret making the rash decision. He said: 'I actually regret this.' Free at last! The Malkoffs are unshackled after their two day ordeal . The couple were surprisingly good-humoured throughout the 48 hours .

"Whistleblower: Edward Snowden, who worked as a contract employee at the National Security Agency claims he tried to complain 10 times to his superiors . NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden claims that he tried 10 times to make formal complaints about government spy programs but no one listened to him. According to testimony given to the European Parliament released on Friday the former NSA contractor claims that as a contractor, rather than a government worker, he was not protected from raising concerns and decided to take matters into his own hands. Instead of benefiting from Obama's Presidential Policy Directive 19, under which federal employees can question classified programs, Snowden felt that 'individuals like me were left with no proper channels.' 'As an employee of a private company rather than a direct employee of the U.S. government, I was not protected by U.S. whistle-blower laws, and I would not have been protected from retaliation and legal sanction for revealing classified information about lawbreaking in accordance with the recommended process,' Snowden said in his testimony according to the Washington Post. Snowden previously worked for the CIA before joining the NSA in Hawaii as a contractor from Booz Allen Hamilton. Private: The Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corp office building is seen in McLean, Virginia June 11, 2013.  Contracting firm Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corp fired Edward Snowden, after he admitted to releasing information on the U.S. government's broad monitoring of American's phone and Internet data . It was from there that he leaked information about the extent of NSA spying programs to the press before fleeing to Hong Kong and then seeking asylum in Russia. In his testimopny Snowden claimed that he was warned that his concerns were dangerous for his career and that he should keep his head down and maintain a low profile. 'The first were well-meaning but hushed warnings not to 'rock the boat,' for fear of the sort of retaliation that befell former NSA whistle-blowers like Wiebe, Binney, and Drake,' he said, according to the Post, before adding that the other responses were suggestions that he, 'let the issue be someone else's problem.' Snowden said that the culture of silence at the NSA was all-pervasive. Snowden testified, 'there was a unanimous desire to avoid being associated with such a complaint in any form.' The NSA disputes this account, telling The Washington Post that, 'after extensive investigation, including interviews with his former NSA supervisors and co-workers, we have not found any evidence to support Mr. Snowden’s contention that he brought these matters to anyone’s attention.' 'Everyone in the intelligence community is aware of what happens to people who report concerns about unlawful but authorized operations,' he wrote. In the past, Snowden has mentioned that he tried to take four of his superiors to task over the spying program. 'I asked these people, ‘What do you think the public would do if this was on the front page?' he said. 'How is that not reporting it? How is that not raising it?' Controversial: A float displaying giant likenesses of US President Barack Obama (L) and US Intelligence leaker Edward Snowden (R) makes its way during the traditional Rose Monday parade in Duesseldorf, western Germany . Snowden said that no one wanted to be associated with any complaints at the NSA. 'Even among the most senior individuals to whom I reported my concerns,” he continued, “no one at N.S.A. could ever recall an instance where an official complaint had resulted in an unlawful program being ended, but there was a unanimous desire to avoid being associated with such a complaint in any form.' The Justice Department has charged Mr. Snowden with violating the Espionage Act and the fugitiver reiterated his claim that he has taken no documents with his to Russia. 'I didn’t take any documents with me from Hong Kong, and while I’m sure they were disappointed, it doesn’t take long for an intelligence service to realize when they’re out of luck,' he said. 'I would also add, for the record, that the United States government has repeatedly acknowledged that there is no evidence at all of any relationship between myself and the Russian intelligence service,' Mr. Snowden said.","Edward Snowden claimed that a damaging culture of silence exists at the NSA .
In testimony to the European Parliament said that he tried to complain ten times about their spying programs to superiors .
Was advised to keep quiet and to maintain a low profile .
Said that as a contractor with no legal protection from complaining was left with no choice but to leak the information to the press ."
"British No 1 and Wimbledon champion Andy Murray is engaged to Kim Sears, his girlfriend of more than nine years. Murray's representatives have confirmed the engagement of 27-year-old Murray and Sears, aged 26, but have not released any details or where the proposal took place. Sussex-born Miss Sears, who has an English Literature degree, met Murray at the US Open in 2005. Her father is player-turned-coach Nigel Sears. Andy Murray poses with the Wimbledon trophy along with his fiancee Kim Sears . Murray was on his way to the Philippines on Wednesday to play in the International Premier Tennis League. But he gave no indication of his big news, instead tweeting: 'Off to the Philippines for the first time today, should be a fun trip... Anyone got some suggestions for first time tourists in Manila?' The couple met in 2005 at the US Open when Kim was travelling with her dad Nigel, who is a tennis coach. Their meeting came long before he acquired fame and fortune. She was only 17 at the time and Andy was her first serious boyfriend. He said: 'I'm lucky. I know she isn't with me because I'm in the spotlight.' The couple briefly split for six months in 2009 but they now share a multi-million pound mansion in Oxshott, Surrey with their dogs Maggie and Rusty.

Murray climbs into his  player's box to celebrate with friends, family and members after beating Novak Djokovic in the 2013 final . In the past Murray has been notoriously reluctant to answer questions about his relationship with Sears but earlier this year he was forced to deny that he planned to marry her after joking about his love life on Twitter. Asked when he plans to marry Miss Sears during a Twitter Q&A with fans in January, Murray responded: 'We're getting married just after Wimbledon, should be a great day.' But just hours later, Murray was forced to issue another tweet explaining that his words were said with his tongue firmly in cheek after the original message went viral. He tweeted: '3 things.. I don't smoke grass, I'm not getting married(yet) and I don't want to kill rafael Nadal.. [sic]' Murray flies the flag aloft following his 2012 Olympic triumph over Roger Federer .

In June it was reported that bookies believed the Scot had asked Sears to marry him - after a flurry of betting on him popping the question at Wimbledon. Tennis fans bet heavily on the champion to both retain his 2013 title and get engaged at 8/1 with bookmaker William Hill, which eventually stopped taking bets on it.

In releasing a statement on Wednesday, he reaffirmed his commitment to working with Amelie Mauresmo next year, with whom he teamed up at the start of this summer's grass court season.","Andy Murray's representatives have confirmed engagement to Kim Sears .

"Click HERE to read Martin Samuel's match report . Again it was all about the team sheet. Another Champions League night for Liverpool, more intense scrutiny on the names Brendan Rodgers unveiled before kick-off. In Madrid three weeks ago, Rodgers caused a hullabaloo when making wholesale changes to his starting line-up, drawing criticism for appearing to run up the white flag before their collision with the defending champions. This time, though, his selection was far more significant. On a freezing cold night in Sofia, Rodgers decided that Liverpool needed to be solid, they needed experience and composure – and he sent out a team containing just two of the signings he made this summer. Summer signings Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren, Philippe Coutinho and Emre Can started the match on the  bench . Rickie Lambert, who joined Liverpool in the summer, scored his second Liverpool goal  against Ludogorets . Dejan Lovren became Liverpool's most expensive defender when he sealed a £20million move to Anfield . Rodgers does not duck away from making big calls but on night when he was under intense pressure this was revealing. He spent more than £110million on nine acquisitions but only Rickie Lambert (£4million from Southampton) and Javier Manquillo (loan from Atletico Madrid) made the cut. Both of those, it must be noted, performed with credit. Lambert got a goal – his second in as many matches – at a crucial stage and led the line purposefully, while Manquillo defended stoically; he did all that was asked of him, standing tall, keeping possession and firing into tackles. But there was no Alberto Moreno, the young left back who came from Sevilla. He was consigned to the bench along with Dejan Lovren (the most expensive defender in Liverpool’s history), Adam Lallana and Emre Can. In effect, £67million wrapped up in blankets to repel the cold. Lazar Markovic was nowhere to be seen. He cost £20million but has been so underwhelming that he is yet to provide a goal or an assist. Mario Balotelli, meanwhile, was back at home, resting his injured groin. Neither of them were missed. That shouldn’t be the case. Rodgers pointed out in March, when discussing Tottenham, that when a clubs spend huge sums of money they 'should expect to be challenging for the league'; it could be argued, then, that spending huge sums of money should at the very least improve a team. Liverpool playmaker Lazar Markovic has failed to impress since joining from Portuguese outfit Benfica . Mario Balotelli is yet to score a Premier League goal for Liverpool since returning to England . It is why this team sheet was far more enlightening than the one that was produced in Estadio Santiago Bernabeu. This, in not so many words, was Rodgers saying he could not trust those expensively assembled recruits to do a job when it was most required. ‘We needed the squad rebuilt,’ Rodgers explained last month. ‘That decision was made (knowing) players might struggle a bit initially but in the future they would be big players for the club. That is where we are at. Are we playing as fluent as we were last season? No. 'But is there big potential in the team? I believe there is. It may be difficult for other people to understand it because of where we were last season. As I said the natural progress of the team was halted a wee bit because we lost a world class talent.’ Any team would have been hurt by the sale of Luis Suarez but it said everything here that Rodgers needed to summon players who have been sparingly used. Take Lucas Leiva. The Brazil midfielder faces an uncertain future and has been linked with moves away but he came in and was stoic. There was nothing flash or fancy about what he did but he won tackles and cajoled his team-mates, scuffling for possession when it ended up at the feet of those in green. Lucas, who was courted by Napoli in August, doesn’t do a glamorous job but he does it selflessly and it allows other to thrive. Brendan Rodgers decided to leave the majority of his summer recruits in the cold against Ludogorets . Lucas (right) made his first Liverpool appearance since his side's match against Real Madrid . Steven Gerrard, for one, looked more comfortable with Lucas in behind him. The 4-1-4-1 formation also brought out flashes of the best from Jordan Henderson, who motored forward to score the games decisive goal, and the outstanding Raheem Sterling. Toure, another who could have left during the transfer window with Turkish clubs interested, had some erratic moments but he performed far better than Lovren has done, sticking his head out time and again to preserve Liverpool’s lead. The added spin-off of Toure’s performance was Martin Skrtel playing with considerably more composure. Rodgers cannot leave the Ivorian out against Stoke on Saturday as was the case when he failed to retain his place after excelling against Madrid; he has done more in his last two performances than Lovren has managed since he arrived from Southampton. ‘You just have to be patient with him,’ Rodgers argued after Lovren had scored a winning goal against Middlesbrough in the Capital One Cup. ‘He’ll be a top centre-half for this club. He is a big talent. Once he has this year and finds the levels of working here, he will do very, very well. The problem is that players are judged so early now.’ That may be so but they are judged for a reason. When they come at a premium price, the demand for them to start producing is instant and none of Liverpool’s big buys have shown they are capable of making an impact yet. Had they been able to, Rodgers would have included them. He did not spend all that money with the support of Fenway Sports Group to put together an expensive bench. He brought them to make a difference when in the games that truly matter. In spending the night watching the action unfold in front of them, we can safely say Rodgers does not believe they are ready. So the question remains: will they ever?","Liverpool summer signings Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren and Emre Can were unused substitutes against Ludogorets .
