Confidence in the housing market among home owners has soared to its highest level in three years with prices forecast to rise by £10,000 this summer. Research by a property search website found almost three-quarters of home owners (74 per cent) expect house prices in their area to rise by September, with the predicted increase averaging 4.5 per cent. That would put an extra £10,152 on the average home worth £225,601. It is further evidence that the market is starting to 'turn a corner', Zoopla said. Both the proportion of people forecasting house price increase and the typical size of the anticipated increase are the highest figures recorded in around three years by the quarterly study, which began in 2009. Property search website Zoopla said almost three-quarters of home owners (74 per cent) expect house prices in their area to rise by September . But confidence varied widely, and in stark contrast to the rest of the UK, no one surveyed in Northern Ireland predicted that prices will increase in their area by the end of the summer. One third of home owners living in Northern Ireland said that prices will be flat over the coming months and two-thirds predict falls. House prices in Northern Ireland have been declining sharply since the economic downturn, following a period of strong increases. Zoopla said that confidence in Northern Ireland has consistently been well below the rest of the UK for more than a year. Home owners in London, where the market has stood up relatively strongly amid high levels of interest from overseas buyers, were the most bullish. Nine out of 10 (89 per cent) people in the capital expect prices to rise by the end of the summer. Only one in 25 Londoners expects to see prices fall. Researchers found only 13 per cent of home owners now expect prices to fall over the coming months, compared with 19 per cent in December . Confidence tended to be concentrated in . southern England. It was higher than average in the South West, the . South East and the East of England. Meanwhile, it was below average in the Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber, the North West and the North East, as well as in Wales and Scotland. Zoopla said that across the country, there has been a strong uplift in housing market confidence since the start of 2013, with just 65 per cent of home owners predicting increases over the coming months at the end of last year. Only 13 per cent of home owners now expect prices to fall over the coming months, compared with 19 per cent in December. Here is how house price confidence . varies across the UK according to Zoopla, with the percentage of people . expecting price falls followed by the share predicting they will be flat . and rise: . :: Yorkshire and the Humber, 22%, 16%, 61% . :: West Midlands, 18%, 17%, 65% . :: Wales, 20%, 10%, 70% . :: South West, 11%, 13%, 76% . :: South East, 8%, 12%, 81% . :: Scotland, 21%, 14%, 65% . :: Northern Ireland, 67%, 33%, 0% . :: North West, 18%, 12%, 71% . :: North East, 21%, 17%, 62% . :: London, 4%, 8%, 89% . :: East of England, 10%, 14%, 76% . :: East Midlands, 18%, 17%, 64% . The website put some of the recent boost down to a package of measures announced by the Government in last month's Budget designed to give more people with small deposits a helping hand. From next year, the Help to Buy Scheme will offer Government guarantees from 2014 to support up to £130billion of higher loan-to-value (LTV) mortgages over three years. Mortgage availability has already increased sharply and lenders have been offering some of their lowest ever rates since the Government launched its Funding for Lending Scheme last August. The scheme gives lenders access to cheap finance in order that the benefits of this are passed on to borrowers. Lenders have recently reported signs that more first-time buyers are getting on the housing ladder, which should help to free up some stuck housing chains. Lawrence Hall, spokesman for Zoopla.co.uk, said: 'The housing market has seen a number of positive events in recent weeks including the Budget and growing confidence from home owners is a significant step towards a recovery. 'With first-time buyer lending gradually increasing and mortgages becoming more readily available, there is real belief that the property market is starting to turn a corner and finally drag itself out of the hole since the financial crisis.' More than 4,000 people took part in the survey last month.","Study finds almost three-quarters expect house prices in their area to rise .

Sandhurst is renaming a hall which commemorates the fallen of a major First World War battle following a £3million donation from the king of Bahrain. The Mons Hall was named to honour thousands of British soldiers who died during the battle in Belgium in 1914. But despite the 100th anniversary of the battle next year, military chiefs are changing its name to King Hamad Hall after the Bahraini ruler, who has given millions to Sandhurst. Sacrifice: Soldiers at the Battle of Mons in September 1914. A hall commemorating the fallen will be renamed after a £3million donation from the Bahrain king . Criticism: The Mons Hall at Sandhurst, pictured, will be renamed to honour the Bahraini monarch . Critics have accused the Army of betraying the dead, and said that  Bahrain – which has been condemned for brutally repressing demonstrators at home – was ‘buying silence’ over its behaviour. Last week thousands of protesters in the Gulf state marked the second anniversary of the pro-democracy uprising. On Thursday, a 16-year-old boy was shot. The king is patron of the Sandhurst Foundation, and paid £3million to help refurbish the hall. The military academy, in Surrey,  also accepted a £15million donation from the United Arab Emirates to build an accommodation block. It raises questions about the college’s links with Gulf states accused of human rights abuses. Labour MP Jeremy Corbyn said: ‘There’s something deeply ironic in renaming a hall that was in memory of soldiers who died in a tragic battle in the First World War in honour of a king who is routinely committing human rights abuses. Change: The room will be named King Hamad Hall, after the Bahraini ruler, pictured with Prime Minister David Cameron, after he gave a donation towards its refurbishment . ‘We should not be accepting money from such people. They are in effect trying to buy our silence.’ Andy Slaughter, a Labour MP who is . chairman of the Commons all-party Democracy In Bahrain group, said: ‘To . change the name of something which commemorates a very tragic episode in . British military history, simply because they’re getting a sum of money . from a rather dubious source, is appalling.’ More . than 1,600 British troops died at Mons, the first major battle of  the . war. Yet against overwhelming  odds, with two Germans to every Briton, . the British Army inflicted  5,000 casualties before being forced  to . withdraw. The Mons Hall will be reopened next . month. King Hamad has been invited and a plaque will be unveiled with . the inscription: ‘King Hamad Hall. Controversial: Critics say the move disrespects the thousands of soldiers who fought and died at Mons . This building, the former Mons Hall, was refurbished in 2013 with a generous gift from the Kingdom of Bahrain.’ There was outrage on the internet at the renaming. Andy in Belfast wrote on MailOnline: ‘One must remember that you can’t “buy” the qualities of our glorious dead.’ Ron, of Bradford, West Yorkshire, wrote: ‘To even think about changing the name is an absolute disgrace.’ A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: ‘All donations to Sandhurst are in compliance with the UK’s domestic and international legal obligations and our values as a nation. ‘Providing defence training and education to overseas cadets at the same high standards used by UK Armed Forces helps to save lives and raise awareness of human rights.’","The Mons Hall will now be called the King Hamad Hall after the £3million gift .

His face covered in blood and screaming . in agony as a medical worker cares for his wounded leg, this iconic picture of Eric Whalley caught the full horror of the Boston bombings. The wounded 65-year-old, who is now on the road to recovery, is a British expatriate who swapped rural Cumbria for Massachusetts as he started a new life. The retired pharmacologist and his wife Ann, 65, who was also hurt in the explosion, moved to the US in 1989 with their two sons. Horror: Eric Whalley, 65, is treated by medics after being caught up in the Boston bombings . The couple remain in hospital after suffering serious injuries in the blast, but are now both awake and are . spending time together in a shared room. Their sons Richard, 25, and Chris, 34, who both live in America, only learnt their parents had been wounded via the internet. They have launched an online drive to raise $200,000 to pay their medical bills. Mr and Mrs Whalley, who were childhood sweethearts at Cockermouth Grammar School, were going for a walk on marathon day when they were caught up in the terror attack. Mr Whalley lost part of his right . foot, suffered damage to his eyesight and brain trauma but has since . regained consciousness and has been able to speak. His wife was placed on a respirator . and will require major leg surgery. They have had nearly 12 operations . between them to remove ball bearings and nails. When Mr Whalley woke up for the first time after the disaster, his son Richard told him he was on the frontpage of the Daily Mail - and he started laughing. Childhood sweethearts: Eric and Ann Whalley, both 65, moved to the US with their two sons in 1989 after growing up in Cockermouth . 'He . was just barely talking, but he was understanding what we said,' Richard said. 'I told him his photo was on the front page of the . Daily Mail. He started laughing.' Mr and Mrs Whalley both grew up in Cockermouth and still have friends living in the area. After nearly 20 years in the US, they became American citizens in 2008. In school, accomplished student Mr Whalley captained his rugby first team and the athletics squad, was on the cross country team, and was also a house captain and prefect. After leaving school he studied at the University of London and at Bradford before lecturing in pharmacology at the University of Manchester for 14 years. He later moved with his wife, a teacher, to the US so he could take up a pharmacology job. John Partridge, who went to school with Mr Whalley in Cockermouth, now lives in Indiana, USA. Fear: Richard Whalley wrote that he was worried his mother was dead in the hours after the bombing when he saw images of his wounded father online . Retirement: Mr Whalley is a retired pharmacologist while his wife Ann is an ex-teacher. The couple have two sons Richard, 25, and Chris, 34 . Brutality of the bombings: Caked in dirt and debris and covered in blood, Mr Whalley is wheeled away into an ambulance after the terror attack . He said: 'I found out the terrible news about the Whalleys via my mother who still lives in Cockermouth. 'I knew Eric very well as a young man. He lived on Woodside Avenue, which was off Kirkfell Avenue in . Cockermouth where I lived, so we basically played together. He was very . keen on sports. 'I knew his parents very well, and his dad came to Cockermouth to work at Millers shoe factory when they opened it. 'Eric was a couple of years behind me at Cockermouth Grammar School and I believe he and his wife were childhood sweethearts.' Mrs Whalley's sister Patricia Underwood . still lives in Cockermouth and it is understood she has another sister . in Harrington and cousins in Maryport. Both Mr and Mrs Whalley have now come out of intensive care, but will require at least two more weeks of hospital treatment and extensive rehabilitation. Richard Whalley and his brother have set up a website to help pay for their parents' medical expenses . Their son Richard only realised they were hurt after seeing his father's photograph on the internet. After spotting the image, which was being used by several news outlets, Richard posted: 'This is my dad in the picture in this link. I have no idea where my mum is. They were both bombed. 'I'm trying to figure out what hospital they are at. Can you help? They look pretty severely injured and I'm worried my mum is dead.' When he tried to find them there was no record of them at any of the hospitals. More than 200 people were injured in the explosion and they had been registered under the wrong names in the ensuing chaos. After staff were asked to double check, the Whalleys were tracked down to separate medical centres. Updates on their condition have been posted on the Give Forward website where the Ann and Eric Recovery Fund has been created and has raised more than $128,400 for their treatment . The family has pledged that anything left over from the fund which is not required will be spent on helping other marathon bombing victims.

New York marathon organizers have blamed the media for the negative publicity that led to the race being cancelled in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. A letter from the New York Road Runners was sent to 47,000 runners on Saturday and said that 'the extensive and growing media coverage antagonistic to the marathon and its participants' had made holding the 26.2-mile race unsafe. A last-minute decision was made on Friday afternoon to cancel the marathon after it was decided it would be divisive to hold the event through the five boroughs. Many runners understood the decision, especially with the death toll from the storm at 107, including 41 in New York City. Scroll down for video . Anger: Two runners extend the middle finger to a NY marathon banner in Central Park after the race was cancelled on Friday out of fears of backlash following Sandy . Carry on regardless: Large groups of runners still took to Central Park on Sunday and ran the original 1970 route . What remains: Julie Traina tries to recover some personal items from the destroyed home of her parents in Staten Island yesterday . The destruction and power outages made . many New Yorkers recoil at the idea of police protecting a foot race and . evicting storm victims from hotels to make way for runners. More than half of the 40,000 runners were from out of town. Gym instructor Frank Salzone, 28, had planned to run the marathon but instead returned to his native Staten Island to coordinate help for those affected. Along with 15 others, Mr Salzone was spending Sunday clearing debris in New Dorp Beach, one of the hardest hit areas. He told MailOnline: 'Those living a few blocks away from my family have been affected and it wasn't until I came out to Staten Island on Thursday that I realized how bad it was. 'I realized that running for four-and-a-half hours was not the best thing when I could be helping and so I decided not to run. 'A lot of people came from out of town for the marathon and I understand it's a once-in-a-lifetime experience, so if they want to run the loop without taking away resources, then fine. 'But if you're from the city, you can run anytime and should be out helping your fellow New Yorkers.' Priorities: Would-be marathon runners in their distinctive orange tops in New Dorp Beach, Staten Island which was one of the hardest hit areas . Here to help: Many marathon runners turned out to help New Yorkers who were hardest hit by clearing debris and bringing supplies . Called off: The marathon was cancelled due to public backlash that resources would be diverted from helping hurricane victims . Cancelled: Two runners, who traveled to New York to take part in the marathon, give a thumbs-down in front of the finish line in Central Park on Saturday after the decision to cancel the race . There was concern from sponsors about a public backlash against the race, according to the New York Post, which began in 1970 with just 127 runners. There . was disappointment among runners who had spent months preparing for the . grueling race which brings in millions of dollars for charities through . fundraising. Some . ‘disenfranchised’ marathoners vowed to run the route anyway. David . McNally, who has lived most of his life in Staten Island, organized an . unofficial shadow marathon. After some consideration, the group decided to do the original 1970 course route of roughly four laps around Central Park. McNally’s project was met with some criticism from people who felt the marathon was insulting to people who’s homes have been destroyed or lost loved ones. ‘Instead of running past neighborhoods where people’s homes once stood in a display of defiance, how about you volunteer and make your trip to NYC worth something bigger than your pride,’ William F Hattar wrote on the Facebook group’s wall. There was anger from some runners with people taking photographs beneath the Marathon banners in Central Park making rude gestures and giving it the thumbs down. Wild west: People walk through the heavily damaged Rockaway neighborhood in Queens where a large section of the iconic boardwalk was washed away . In the race: Runners disappointed with the cancellation of the New York City Marathon decided to run it anyway - with many donating money to help victims of superstorm Sandy . Outrage: Workers prepare to remove generators, used by the New York Road Runners Club, outside of Central Park near the finish line on Saturday . Runners insisted the mock-marathon will be a display of New York’s resilience. ‘If it were a baseball game, no one would challenge the idea of letting the show go on,’ Renia Ellen Saddler wrote on the page. ‘This isn’t about ego; this is a reminder that humans are strong and brilliant, and we will not go gentle into that good night.' However the majority of participants agreed with the decision to cancel the race. Hundreds of people were making their way to devastated communities up and down the East Coast to volunteer. Runners carrying backpacks filled with things like baby wipes and energy bars went to those in need in Staten Island. Many runners wore the vests they would have had on had they taken part in the race. 'We initially were bummed, but also saddened by the perception that runners were indifferent to the needs of other people,' Jordan Metzl, a sports medicine doctor in New York, told the Associated Press. 'We wanted to turn a negative to a positive.' Aid: A boy watches as members of the U.S. Army National Guard unload food and supplies in the Rockaways section of Queens . Stranded residents have been relying on volunteers delivering food, water, warm clothes and other basic necessities. Almost one week after the superstorm struck the East Coast, power was still out to some 2.5 million customers, the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Electricity Delivery & Energy Reliability reported. The state with the largest number of outages by far is still New Jersey with 32 per cent of customers without power.

A grieving daughter was forced to take her late father's ashes to their local bank to prove to staff he was dead. Siobhon Peers, 31, had lost her father David, aged 67, to bone cancer in October 2011. But she received around 20 letters from the Royal Bank of Scotland claiming her father owed £6 on his account. Although she sent a copy of her father's death certificate to close the account the bank insisted the original certificate must be shown. Siobhan Peers took her father's ashes, in the green box, into her bank to prove to staff he was dead . Mother-of-two Miss Peers was then mailed a string of further letters as the outstanding overdraft amount mushroomed to £625 with interest. Eventually Miss Peers stunned bank staff and customers by going to the local RBS branch in Davenport, near Stockport, Greater Manchester, in person with the urn containing her father's ashes. She then dumped it on the counter - along with the original death certificate and declared: 'You wanted proof my dad is dead - well here he is. I've brought him along with me.' She said: 'I took my dad to the bank, slapped his ashes on the counter and thought that would be the end of it. There was nothing owing on the account and I was sick of getting hassled.' Miss Peers, who was her father's carer after he retired as a builder's labourer added: 'It has been 18 months of hell. I have told the bank over and over to close the account and it hasn't been done. 'They asked me for a copy of his death certificate and I sent it straight away but still they didn't close it down. Miss Peers stunned bank staff and customers by going to the local RBS branch (pictured) in Davenport, near Stockport, Greater Manchester, in person with the urn containing her father's ashes . 'Because of that it built up charges from direct debits and charges grew to over £600.' She said she took her father's ashes to the RBS branch two weeks ago after reaching the end of her tether. She said: 'I slapped his ashes down on the counter and said ""This is David Peers and I want to close his account for him"". The lady behind the counter had such a shock that she ran away and wouldn't come back. Miss Peers received around 20 letters from the Royal Bank of Scotland claiming her father owed £6 on his account . 'Eventually the bank manager came to see me and agreed to close the account. But even after that I had another letter to my father from the bank come to the house. I just can't believe how the bank has treated us. 'It is as if the bank has been deliberately trying to upset me. It has been a very difficult time losing my father and this has just made it so difficult. I have had on average two letters per week for the past 18 months chasing him forthe bank charges. 'All I want now is a decent apology. I sent them a copy of the death certificate and that should have been enough. I didn't want to give them the original as I obviously I wanted to keep that.' The problem started with an unresolved £6 charge on the account after Mr Peers's death which the RBS told his daughter had been imposed as there were insufficient funds to cover a withdrawal. It increased to more than £600 and has now been passed onto a debt recovery agent although the account has been closed. Miss Peers who has two sons and still lives in the house she shared with her father, lost her mother Norma when she was just 15. A spokesman for the Royal Bank of Scotland said: 'After Ms Peers visited the branch further information came to light which meant it was necessary to contact her again.

Integrity: Theresa May has announced plans to force senior officers to disclose their pay and perks . Police who behave like thugs will be put on a national ‘struck off’ register to stop them sneaking back to work at a new force. In a dramatic shake-up of police rules, Theresa May yesterday also announced plans to force senior officers to disclose their pay and perks. There will be a new register of second jobs held by all officers so that the public knows if a constable is moonlighting. Officers have been known to work in jobs such as undertaker, vicar and pole-dancing teacher. And police will be stopped from effectively investigating themselves over allegations of serious misconduct. In future, all complaints will be referred to a beefed-up version of the Independent Police Complaints Commission. The Home Secretary said the aim of the measures was to restore ‘integrity’ in the police. It follows scandals over the G20 protests, the police handling of the Andrew Mitchell ‘Plebgate’ row and the cover-up of their role in the Hillsborough disaster. Mrs May said: ‘We need clearer rules for how officers should conduct themselves.’ She pledged that, in future, disciplinary hearings against officers who resign or retire will be pursued until their conclusion. Currently, officers can escape a guilty verdict by standing down, which brings an automatic halt to proceedings. Anyone found guilty will be placed on a struck-off list managed by the new National College of Policing and available to all forces at home and abroad. To the irritation of some MPs, guilty officers will not be stripped of their pension. But Mrs May said they would lose out financially because they would be unable to find another police job, either in Britain or elsewhere. Struck off: A new register of second jobs held by all officers so that the public knows if a constable is moonlighting . It is intended to prevent a repeat of the shocking case of PC Simon Harwood, a riot squad officer denounced as a ‘thug in uniform’. Newspaper seller Ian Tomlinson died after PC Harwood lashed him with a baton and shoved him to the ground during the London G20 protests in 2009. The officer had an appalling record of complaints against him for violence in the years before the incident. But he was able to continue working in the police by playing the system. He retired from the Met on medical grounds on the eve of a disciplinary hearing, re-joined the same force on its civilian staff three days later, then moved on to Surrey Police before returning to serve with the Met in 2004. An inquest found Mr Tomlinson had been unlawfully killed. But a jury found PC Harwood – who has since been sacked by the Met – not guilty of manslaughter. The jury was not told of his disciplinary record. The register of police pay and hospitality will be published online and regularly updated. Officers’ second jobs, which they have already had to disclose to their force, will now be published online. A stronger system of vetting before senior officers are appointed will also be developed. Police bosses will have to consider a candidate’s background – such as any allegations of sexual misconduct – when making recruitment decisions.","A new register of second jobs held by all officers so public knows if constable is moonlighting .

From cookbooks to cranberries, putting Delia Smith’s name to something has long been a recipe for success. Substitute a dash of Delia with a pinch of Pippa, however, and it seems to leave a rather sour taste. Customers are struggling to stomach the news that the Duchess of Cambridge’s sister is replacing Delia as a columnist in Waitrose’s magazine. Pippa Middleton's new role seems to have left a sour taste in Waitrose customers' mouths . Just days after Miss Middleton was appointed as the face of the supermarket, shoppers have flooded Waitrose’s Twitter and Facebook accounts with their complaints. ‘A gratuitous insult to any customers with half a brain!’ wrote one, as another warned: ‘If her party book is anything to go by, you may well regret your decision.’ Pippa’s book, Celebrate, offered illuminating advice including a recipe for making ice. It also gave tips such as pouring hot drinks from flasks into ‘mugs or paper cups’, and counselled that toasting marshmallows over a fire required ‘a long-handled fork’ and ‘flames’. Waitrose ditched Delia, 71 – whose cookery books have sold 21million copies – when her three-year contract ended in January. The first column by Pippa, 29, will be published in the April edition of Waitrose Kitchen, on sale from the end of this month. The magazine’s editor has promised she will dispense sage advice on how to prepare a ‘Friday night feast’, and said her ‘wealth of experience’ will be ‘loved’ by readers. But customers have already begun asking why they would take cookery tips from someone who has ‘probably never boiled an egg’. Kitchen favourite: Delia is considered a domestic expert , but Waitrose have asked Pippa to hand out cookery advice . One Twitter user wrote: ‘Can’t believe Waitrose has replaced queen of cooking Delia with Pippa’, while another said: ‘I want a real cook to inspire me, not a relative of the royals who just happens to be famous for wearing a dress.’ The comments can all be viewed on Waitrose’s Twitter feed, which has 42,000 followers. Meanwhile, on the supermarket’s Facebook page, James Hunting wrote that Pippa’s appointment was a ‘ridiculous idea’, adding: ‘I am not sure she has a grasp on the lifestyle and concerns of the typical Waitrose shopper.’ Another customer, David Lee, added: ‘Why oh why would you drop Delia Smith, we have used her recipes for years! Pippa is hardly a famous cook, perhaps a few cupcakes, does that qualify her for the job?’ Gamely, Waitrose has been replying to each and every comment, thanking customers for their ‘suggestions’ and repeating: ‘Pippa is not a replacement for Delia. Pippa will write a column in our monthly Waitrose Kitchen magazine.’ Pippa has told fans she is looking forward to writing her column, saying: ‘It will be an exciting opportunity to share my passion and enthusiasm for food and entertaining.’ Last night a Waitrose spokesman said: ‘We are not making any  comment about what is on  Facebook and Twitter because we are absolutely delighted that Pippa Middleton is joining us as a  columnist.’ Delia Smith was unavailable for comment.","Shoppers flood Waitrose's Twitter and Facebook accounts with complaints .

Bonuses in the City soared to record levels in April this year as bankers deferred pay outs to take advantage of the cut in the top rate of tax, new figures suggest. Labour leader Ed Miliband challenged David Cameron over the dramatic rise in payouts to business and finance workers, up 64 per cent year-on-year. The sharp rise came as the top rate of tax fell from 50p to 45p from the start of April. Rise: Bonus pay rose dramatically in April this year, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics . During an intense clash at Prime Minister’s Questions, Mr Miliband revealed the figures from the Office for National Statistics which showed that bonuses in the business and financial services this April were 64 per cent higher than a year ago. The Labour leader said: ‘The reality is that bonuses are up 64 per cent in April in the City because he has cut the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p. ‘So people took their bonuses in April and got a massive tax cut as a result.' He added: ‘For all his tough talk the reality is he is dodging his responsibility on banking reform. ‘Lending is falling, bonuses are rising and while ordinary families are suffering he is giving a tax cut to millionaires.’ Average weekly bonuses payments in finance and business services were £143 in April, up 64.4 per cent on the same time in 2012 and the highest level in records dating back to 2000. Labour leader Ed Miliband claimed ordinary families were suffering while tax was being cut for high earners . Mr Cameron took aim at Labour’s record in power, blaming them for a failure to regulate. The . Prime Minister said: ‘Bankers bonuses were about a third of what they . were when he was in the Treasury. They have been going down not up.’ He . said Mr Miliband, and shadow chancellor Ed Balls, had questions to . answer about their role working for the Treasury before the financial . crash. Mr Cameron added: ‘In . 2012-13 city bonuses will be 85 per cent lower than they were in . 2005-08 when those two were working or advising the government with . responsibility for regulating the City. ‘He cannot get over the fact that they presided over the boom and bust and a failure to regulate. ‘They cannot hide their dreadful record and they should start with an apology.’ In January Goldman Sachs abandoned plans to delay paying out bonuses to help bankers avoid the 50p tax rate. The u-turn came hours after Bank of England boss Sir Mervyn King branded the idea 'depressing' and accused bankers of mis-judging public anger at the damage caused by the financial crash. The investment bank had considered waiting to award equity bonuses deferred from previous years, due to pay out in January until after April 6. But the bank's Comp Committee of the board ruled out the idea. Prime Minister David Cameron said Labour had failed to properly regulate the banks before the 2007 crash . BT chief executive Ian Livingston is to become a government minister. He will replace former HSBC chairman Lord Green as trade minister when he stands down at the end of the year. David Cameron told MPs: 'I can announce today that Ian Livingston, for the past five years chief executive of BT, one of Britain's most successful businesses, will take on this vital role. 'I believe he will bring huge talent to a vital national effort.' The row came as a major report . recommended that bosses of failed banks should face jail or lose the . right to claim bonuses for up to ten years for 'reckless misconduct'. The . new criminal offence would make sure that top executives paid for their . 'shocking and widespread malpractice', the Parliamentary Commission on . Banking Standards said. Not a . single British banker has been sent to prison since the financial crash . began in 2007, but the proposed legislation would make sure they would . be 'on the hook' in future, it added. As well as prison terms, errant . bankers would face heavy fines and bans from the financial services . industry, as well as curbs on bonuses and the threat of pensions being . cancelled. In the Commons, Mr Cameron was pressed on whether he supported the recommendations on bonuses and criminal penalties. 'Yes, I do support both of those measures,"" he said.'Obviously we need to take time to read this excellent report. 'But penalising, including criminal penalties against bankers who behave irresponsibly, I say yes. Also, making sure that banks who are in receipt of taxpayers' money that you can claw back... bonuses, I say yes too.' He said ministers would be using the Banking Bill currently going through parliament to implement the plans.","Financial and business service bonuses up 64% year-on-year .

Runaway schoolteacher Jeremy Forrest could be considered a paedophile who groomed his vulnerable young victim to satisfy his ‘carnal lust,’ a court heard today. The married maths master betrayed the trust of the 15-year-old schoolgirl and her family when he fled to France with the pupil for eight days,  it was claimed. Forrest, who appeared to have a black eye as he sat in the dock at Lewes Crown Court, was accused of taking the teenager on the ‘oddest school trip’. Scroll down for video . Artist drawing of runaway schoolteacher Jeremy Forrest as he sat in . Lewes Crown Court, charged with abduction of a 15-year-old . schoolgirl. His wife Emily is shown giving evidence from behind a curtain . Prosecutor Richard Barton said in his closing speech: ‘You do not have to decide whether he was a paedophile. Arriving: Teacher Jeremy Forrest is taken into Lewes Crown Court where it was revealed he would not give evidence and cried when his sister gave a statement in his defence . ‘You may consider, in the context of what he did, that is not an inappropriate label for him. ‘It is about his desires to have that young sexual flesh, to satisfy his own carnal lusts.’ ‘You may feel it had nothing to do with her, it was to do with him, with his desires. ‘You may feel he is a man who is flattered by the attention of very young, vulnerable girls.’ The prosecutor said it was interesting that his wife, Emily Forrest, was a ‘very young-looking, petite woman with her own vulnerabilities.’ ‘There is a word for it. It's called grooming - being caring, being kind, being close, gaining confidence, gaining the trust of that person and then you can do what you want to do with them.’ He said it was not a case of Romeo and Juliet as they would have to have been ‘equal’ partners in what happened, whereas Forrest’s role in absconding was ‘absolutely central.’ ‘He was there running it.’ ‘A teenager isn't going to get out of Eastbourne, let alone out of the country.’ He . went on: ‘You may well feel he is self-centred, mainly concerned with . his self, his needs and desires and not others, you may also feel he is a . coward.’ Referring . to the eight days they spent on the run in Bordeaux, in which they used . fake names to apply for jobs, he added: ‘You may feel it is the oddest . school trip in which one teacher goes away with one pupil and school . activities include having sex with a 15-year-old and changing . identities.’ The schoolgirl’s mother wept in the public gallery as Mr Barton said that the worst  ‘betrayal’ had been of her daughter. Family: Jim and Julie Forrest (centre and right) arrive with their daughter Carrie (left), who defended her brother as a devoted uncle and godfather today . In court: Emily Forrest, pictured, fled Lewes Crown Court in tears yesterday after giving evidence at the trial of her husband Jeremy who absconded to France with his 15-year-old pupil . Married: Jeremy and Emily Forrest together before he allegedly ran off to France with a pupil . He said: ‘She trusted him with all her vulnerabilities and he was the figure of authority and he won't be the first figure of authority who someone gets a crush on him and he won't be the last, but part of the role of a figure of authority is that you do not take advantage of it. ‘You do not expect your school to invite people to have sex with your under-age daughter and you do not expect it to be the teacher.’ Mr Barton reminded the jury that Forrest had decided not to give evidence and had not filed a statement of his defence. He continued: ‘Mr Forrest, what is your defence? ‘You may feel this is the question he fears the most because, during his experience as a teacher, he may have heard some pretty lame excuses for homework not being done on time. Upset: Emily Forrest, the wife of Jeremy Forrest, his as she left Lewes Crown Court in East Sussex yesterday . Claims: Forrest, pictured today, heard how friends had called him an outstanding teacher who had improved students' grades . ‘And he may think 'Please, sir, I don't . have a defence - my dog ate it' isn't going to cut the mustard, isn't . going to stand up to scrutiny and that he had no defence at all. ‘You may feel he is a maths teacher whose story doesn't add up. I invite you to find him guilty as charged.’ Forrest, who denies one charge of child abduction, declined to testify in his defence. Judge Michael Lawson QC said the jury was ‘open to draw inferences’ from this decision. The teacher wept as six character witnesses were read to the court from his behalf. His sister, Carrie Hanspaul, a mother-of-three from Kent, described her brother as a doting uncle and godfather. She said: 'He's very good-natured and extremely mild-mannered,' adding that depression may have contributed to his recent actions. She said: 'Jeremy had been in a very difficult relationship for the last six years but didn't want to worry anybody, especially our parents, with his problems. 'Instead he withdrew more and more and I believe he became more and more depressed.' Ronald Jaffa, defending, told the jury that Forrest had gone with the girl to France because he feared she was suicidal. He said that this was a 'realistic situation' and the defendant had acted to ensure her well-being. He said that it was not a case of Romeo and Juliet. The schoolgirl's mother told Lewes Crown Court she 'went mad' at her daughter when she confronted her about Forrest . He said: 'In that play the lovers died in the end, a pair of star-crossed lovers is the way Shakespeare put it. 'Fortunately Jeremy chose to go to see her and go with her, what could have happened if he had not? What would it matter if she had money or not, she could have hitch-hiked, she could have ended up in a city alone, desperate, suicidal.' He added: 'She was very desperate, she had suicidal thoughts and she was assertive. If he had not taken her, the alternative consequences were likely to be much worse. 'If he had taken her back to her mother or the police, no-one would be able to stop her, it may indeed have been the catalyst for worse consequences.' Judge Lawson adjourned the case until tomorrow when he will sum up the case before sending the jury out to consider its verdict.

A criminal inquiry was under way last night into claims a Liberal Democrat peer molested party activists. Lord Rennard, who was the party’s powerful chief executive, now faces being questioned by detectives. Scotland Yard said interviews with alleged victims since the scandal broke in February justify a full probe. The peer is accused of behaving . inappropriately towards a number of women in the party, but has . repeatedly denied any wrongdoing . In further highly damaging developments for the Lib Dems it emerged that: . In his key party role, Lord Rennard presided over ‘training’ weekends attended by hundreds of female party hopefuls. Some of them claimed he tried to entice them back to his bedroom and one . threatened to blow the whistle at a tribunal before she was paid off by . the party. Others say they were left ‘shamed and humiliated’ during his . alleged campaign of sexual harassment. One alleged he put his hands where they had ‘no business being’ and . another branded him ‘repugnant’ for allegedly forcing his hand up her . dress as they posed for a photo. Alleged victim Alison Smith has said she decided to go public because Lord Rennard appeared back on the scene . The scandal erupted in February when two female party activists – Alison . Smith and Bridget Harris – spoke to Channel 4 News. The Lib Dem . leadership was quickly accused of turning a ‘blind eye’. Scotland Yard officers initially worked to establish if the allegations against Lord Rennard could constitute criminal offences. As with other inquiries into ‘historic’ allegations, they contacted the . potential victims and witnesses to see whether they would be willing to . speak openly. Last night, a police spokesman said they were ‘carrying out inquiries to corroborate those allegations’. Detectives had asked the Lib Dems to suspend their own inquiry into Lord . Rennard and to hand them any information from a whistleblowing hotline. It is understood that a major trawl of emails and other documentation . has taken place with a dossier of information handed to police. In an intriguing twist, potential victims and witnesses have been warned . not to speak to the media as their actions may prejudice the inquiry. This suggests that detectives believe there is a possibility that a jury . may eventually be asked to rule on criminal allegations against Lord . Rennard. The Lib Dem leadership was quickly accused of turning a ¿blind eye¿ when party activist Bridget Harris spoke to Channel 4 News . At least ten women are alleged to have made complaints that constitute evidence of criminal sexual assault. Senior party figures face embarrassing questions about their own botched . ‘inquiry’ into the allegations around five years ago. Mr Clegg, whose . office asked two senior MPs to look into the claims, is yet to explain . fully what he knew and when. The Deputy Prime Minister admits he knew of ‘indirect and non-specific concerns’ as early as 2008. His office asked Mr Alexander, his then chief of staff, to look into the . claims. Mr Alexander spoke to the peer to warn him that any such . behaviour was unacceptable. Mr Clegg’s deputy chief of staff, Alison Suttie, also asked Miss . Swinson, then party spokesman for women and equality, to carry out a . probe. Serious allegations: Lord Rennard presided over training weekend attended by party hopefuls . She was asked to ‘quietly interview’ party workers making claims against Lord Rennard. She did so, but no action was taken and she referred subsequent complaints back to Miss Suttie in Mr Clegg’s office. Miss Swinson is also accused of telling a colleague that Lord Rennard . had an issue with women but ‘you just have to put up with it’. Former Lib Dem chief whip Paul Burstow was also informed about the . claims against Lord Rennard but did nothing. A year later, in 2009, the . peer stepped down as chief executive and took early retirement, . ostensibly through ill health. When the furore broke, David Cameron called on Mr Clegg to ‘get to the . bottom of it’. The Lib Dem leader criticised the ‘self-appointment . detectives’ of the Press but was later forced to thank them for exposing . the allegations. Last night John Mann, the Labour MP who first called for a police . inquiry into the allegations, said Mr Clegg had questions to answer. ‘We need to leave the police to do their job, and I’m sure all concerned . will co-operate fully with the police inquiry,’ he added. ‘Clearly there will be questions to answer. The Liberals have handled this very, very badly. ‘Moving from no real inquiry at all, to a police inquiry is a big gulf, . and it indicates that Liberal party processes are not robust enough and . will need to be re-examined. This is more than embarrassment for Nick . Clegg, it is a problem because they should have investigated the . allegations properly. ‘He is the Deputy Prime Minister. You’ve got to run your own party . properly and he clearly hasn’t, or it wouldn’t have got to this stage.’ Lord Rennard’s lawyers have insisted he ‘always strived to conduct . himself responsibly and appropriately at all times’. He strenuously . denies any wrongdoing. A Liberal Democrat spokesman said: ‘There is no indication that the police want to speak to Nick. ‘The police are continuing their ongoing investigation into allegations made against Chris Rennard. ‘The party continues to liaise with the Met, and has been since the . allegations were first raised by Channel 4 in February. The party . encourages anyone with information they feel may assist the police with . their inquiries to contact them.’ He said there was no indication police wanted to talk to senior party figures involved in the 2008 party investigation. A Met spokesman said: ‘As is standard in cases of an historic nature, . officers’ initial inquiries are made to establish if allegations of . crime are being made and if there are potential victims and witnesses . who are prepared to speak to police. ‘Officers then carry out inquiries to corroborate those allegations, and in this case that process is on-going.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Police looking to see if there is corroborating evidence to back up claims .

A self-styled 'Lord' led the life of an international playboy bankrolled by a £34.5million  global fraud scam, a court heard today. ‘Lord’ Edward Davenport, 46, hosted lavish parties at his £10m mansion, and boasted of befriending A list celebrities and royalty including supermodel Kate Moss, and Princes William and Harry. But Fast Eddie, as he was known to his friends, was exposed as a cynical fraudster who duped 51 victims out of their life savings through bogus start-up loan schemes. 'Fast Eddie': Edward Davenport pictured with his Thai girlfriend Monthira Sanan-Ua. A self-styled 'Lord' led the life of an international playboy bankrolled by global fraud made £34.5million from the scam . The conman, born Edward Ormus Sharington Davenport, promised millions of pounds which never materialised after he had pocketed the administration fees and advance payments. Princess Diana’s wedding dress designer Elizabeth Emanuel was one who fell prey to Davenport’s scheme, losing her life savings as a consequence. Davenport and his lieutenants, Peter Riley and Borge Andersen were jailed in 2011 for the scam, which entrapped entrepreneurs from as far afield as India, Canada and Dubai. Davenport, who was sentenced to seven and a half years behind bars, was not at Southwark Crown Court today for the beginning of a three week confiscation hearing. Prosecutor Simon Mayo QC said Davenport is thought to have made £34.5m gained through his criminal dealings, revealed in bank accounts, property, and profit from his enterprises during the six year con, between 2003 and 2009. But Davenport will argue he should only pay back £8m of his criminal proceeds. ‘The prosecution figure of over £34m arises from the application of three statutory assumptions in the proceeds of crime act’, said Mr Mayo. ‘The figure under the first assumption of £17.5m is made up principally of money transferred into bank accounts during that six year period. ‘We assume any of the property held by the defendant at any time after the date of conviction, May 19, 2011, was obtained by him as a result of general criminal conduct. ‘That amounts to £12.5m.’ He said the total amount Davenport is thought to have made is comprised of inflation in the value of money, and profit from other property deals. Davenport enticed his victims who a website boasting of his champagne and sports-car lifestyle and a £100m property portfolio in Britain, Thailand and Monaco. He lent his 110 room west London mansion for an Agent Provocateur advert featuring Kate Moss, and for scenes in the Oscar-winning movie The King’s Speech. Central to the confiscation hearing will be the mansion, at 33 Portland Place, which he bought for £3.9m from the Sierra Leone government. The conman, born Edward Ormus Sharington Davenport, promised millions of pounds which never materialised after he had pocketed the administration fees and advance payments . Mr Mayo said the prosecution believe the mansion, valued at £10m, was obtained through fraud, whereas Davenport’s legal team will argue it was bought legally. 'Thirty Three Portland Place is a substantial property in central London, the freehold reversion of the premises was bought by Edward Davenport on October 31, 2005, for a total purchase price of £3,937,000’, he said. ‘Has Edward Davenport succeeded in convincing that it was not correct to make the statutory assumption that 33 Portland Place represents proceeds of general criminal conduct? ‘Has Edward Davenport shown there would be a serious risk of injustice if that assumption were made?’ Mr Mayo added both defence and prosecution agree Davenport currently has £14m of assets which are available for confiscation. The conman’s defence team argue he should repay £8m, and assert that the London mansion should not be part of proceedings. They will argue £6m should be seized from his Swiss and Monaco bank accounts, just £0.8m in property assets, and £97,000 from a separate property deal. Davenport bought the Sierra Leone High Commission in 1999 for £3.9m while the country was embroiled in civil war . Davenport’s web page boasted: ‘Welcome to the website of Edward Davenport, one of London’s most flamboyant and best known entrepreneurs as well as a true English gentleman from an established British family.’ It suggested that Davenport was a familiar face in ‘exclusive venues across the world’ and had ‘extensive business interests.’ Among the stars Davenport was pictured with on the site’s gallery were actors Hugh Grant, Jeremy Irons, Jude Law and Steve Coogan; music mogul Simon Cowell; rapper 50 Cent, with whom the defendant is shown comparing watches, designers Vivienne Westwood and Jimmy Choo; New Labour spin doctor Alastair Campbell and current Lord Chancellor Ken Clarke; Rolling Stones Mick Jagger and Ronnie Wood and other celebrities such as Jordan, Anna Kournikova, Jean-Claude Van-Damme and Ozzie Osbourne. One of his victims, Miss Emanuel, agreed to surrender 65 per cent of her company in return for a £1.5million investment, but Davenport demanded £20,000 in up-front fees. She told his trial: ‘He knew I was at rock bottom and he wanted to screw me out of every penny. ‘It was unbelievable that he had made all these contacts and bought a title to give him credibility when he was just a common conman. He fully deserves his sentence.’ He turned out in Savile Row suits for his trial, but is now undergoing dialysis treatment three times a week when the court will not sit.

An exotic plant that flowers once in its lifetime before dying has bloomed. The spiky plant had shown no signs of blossoming for 11 years but has now burst into an array of turquoise petals with orange anthers - on what is expected to be the hottest day of the year. The bright colour combination is extremely rare to see in the plant world and is never seen on a plant native to the UK. The exotic bromeliad plant that only blooms once in its lifetime finally burst into flower today after 11-year wait . The flowers of the Puya berteroniana are expected to last for around two weeks but it will sadly be the first and last time the 6ft tall plant blooms as they die shortly after the flowers fade. The plant - a bromeliad - is a relative of the pineapple and is native to the Andes in South America. It has been growing at the Ventnor Botanic Gardens on the Isle of Wight for the last 11 years. But today's hot and humid temperatures set to hit 28C (82F) appear to have encouraged it to flower. The attraction has over 20 species of Puya plants and around 50 of the stunning turquoise variety, however they will not all flower at the same time. The Puya berteroniana, native to Chile, flowers once - for just a couple of weeks - and then dies . Normally the Puya berteroniana requires extremely arid conditions to flourish and has waxy, silver coloured spines on its leaves to protect them against sunlight. However, it is a hardy species and can survive in cooler conditions if kept relatively dry. Chris Kidd, curator at the Ventnor Botanic Gardens, said: 'The Puya berteroniana is a monocarpic plant which means it flowers just once and then dies. 'It will be in flower for a couple of weeks and then hundreds of the seeds will be pollinated by birds, and only one or two of those will survive. Ventnor Botanic Gardens worker Kirsten Morris is dwarfed by the flowers of the Puya berteroniana . 'The colour is an unusual combination, usually flowers are pollinated by flies who can't see the red spectrum, but birds can pick up the orange on the blue background. 'The weather patterns are changing, we had a very wet year last year and it has also been very cold, so the weather might have something to do with it flowering now. 'They are native to the Andes in South America where conditions are very arid and the leaves are covered in a waxy substance to protect them. 'The Puya berteroniana can grow up to 10ft tall and last for 100 years before it flowers, we have had this particular one since 2002. 'Although they normally flower in the summertime it is a waiting game as you can't tell when they are going to.'","Puya berteroniana blossomed today -  likely to be the hottest day of 2013 .

Denial: Commons Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans continues to refute all allegations made against him . Commons Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans continued to protest his innocence yesterday after being arrested on new claims of indecently assaulting young men. Mr Evans, 55, was interviewed by detectives about the latest  allegations, involving three men in their 20s, after answering bail over earlier claims of rape and sexual assault. Afterwards he said he continued to ‘refute’ all the accusations and hoped for swift ‘closure’ over the claims. The Conservative MP for Ribble Valley in Lancashire was first arrested on May 4 at his constituency home in the village of Pendleton. He was held for 15 hours over claims he raped one man and indecently assaulted another, both in their 20s, in the village between 2009 and this year. After being released on bail on that occasion, Mr Evans said he had just endured ‘the worst 24 hours of my life’. He branded the allegations ‘completely false’, saying they had been made by people he had ‘regarded as friends’. Subsequently, a third man gave a statement to police alleging Mr Evans had sexually assaulted him. Also last month a former Parliamentary intern reportedly told detectives the MP groped his bottom in a Commons bar in 2011. The 22-year-old, who had never met Mr Evans, said he had been showing his parents around Parliament at the time. Mr Evans was rearrested after answering bail at Preston police station yesterday morning.

The damaging claim comes just days after Prime  Minister David Cameron paid a surprise visit to the Libyan capital in an attempt to shore up relations between the UK and Libya. In the legal documents, seen by  The Mail on Sunday, the Government calls Mr Belhadj the ‘emir’ or global leader of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG), which it says is a  terrorist organisation. Abdul Hakem Belhaj, the commander of the rebel forces in Tripoli, Libya, insists he has no links to Al Qaeda and is suing the UK Government for authorising his torture . Mr Belhadj is bringing a multi- million-pound claim against the Government over his rendition when he was arrested in Thailand and handed over to Gaddafi in 2004. In the documents, Ministers appear to justify the alleged torture of  Mr Belhadj and his then pregnant wife, who claim they were abducted, chained, hooded and beaten. The Government alleges: ‘In the mid-1990s, the group claimed responsibility for a number of terrorist attacks in Libya.’ It adds: ‘At all  material times MI6 assessed that  elements of the LIFG supported and had links with Al Qaeda.’ Last night, Mr Belhadj rejected the claims and accused the Government of wasting taxpayers’ money on blackening his name. His lawyer, Sapna Malik, said: ‘Mr Belhadj has always denied that he was aligned to Al Qaeda and maintains that the focus of the LIFG under his command was  the removal of Gaddafi.’ She added: ‘Whatever someone’s alleged conduct, this does not make their torture lawful or allow those complicit in their torture off the hook. It would be alarming if the Government were to suggest otherwise.’ The court documents show that the Government, former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw and former MI6 head of counter-terrorism Sir Mark Allen, want Mr Belhadj’s case struck out because his claims are covered by the Official Secrets Act. They all deny  the torture and rendition allegations. The papers also reveal that Mr Straw and the Coalition are prepared to make more claims against Mr Belhadj as the case progresses to trial. Mr Belhadj says British intelligence officers also provided Libyan interrogators with questions to ask their captives and flew to Tripoli to interview the detainees in jail. He also says MI6 alerted Libyan intelligence to his and his  family’s whereabouts. Colonel Gaddafi was killed in 2011. Mr Belhadj, who played a key role in his assassination, insists he is not a terrorist . He also refers to a letter from Sir Mark to Gaddafi’s then head of security, Moussa Koussa, which said: ‘I congratulate you on the safe arrival of [Belhadj]. This was the least we could do for you and for Libya. I know I did not pay for the air cargo [but] the intelligence [on him] was British.’ Cori Crider, from the human rights charity Reprieve, said: ‘The public interest now lies in getting to the full truth about this sordid episode.’ l An Afghan spy who fled to the UK after being exposed as a secret agent working for the CIA is to be sent back to Afghanistan, where he says he faces execution by the Taliban. The 36-year-old male, who can be identified only as MS, left Afghanistan after his cover was blown in an Afghan newspaper, and his brother, also an agent, was murdered by the Taliban. The UK Government claim he is no longer a ‘priority’ for Taliban death squads. Last week, the Court of Appeal backed the Home Office, paving the way for his deportation within weeks.","Libyan Abdel Hakim Belhadj 'wrongly linked to Al Qaeda'

"By . James Nye . PUBLISHED: . 13:56 EST, 30 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:37 EST, 30 January 2013 . It has been revealed that secret salary records of more than one-third of Americans have been shared by their employers with the credit rating agency Equifax. Described as one of the biggest privacy breaches of the modern age, 190 million employment and salary records have been sold to debt collectors and financial service companies through an Equifax-owned subsidiary called The Work Number. Originally created as a fast and easy way to check the employment history of new staff, it has been revealed that The Work Number's database is so detailed it contains week-by-week paycheck information dating back years for tens of millions of people. Openly describing itself as a member of the Equifax family - The Work Number holds almost 200 million individual personal records of American citizens . Worryingly, The Work Number also stores other sensitive information about American citizens such as their health care provider, if they have dental insurance and if they've ever filed an unemployment claim. 'It's the biggest privacy breach in our time, and it’s legal and no one knows it’s going on,' said Robert Mather, who operates an employment background company named Pre-Employ.com. 'It's like a secret CIA.' In 2009, Equifax said the data covered 30 percent of the U.S. working population, and it now says The Work Number is adding 12 million records annually. Equifax and The Work Number obtain the information through thousands of U.S. businesses, including a large number of firms that comprise the Fortune 500. Indeed, 85-percent of civilians employed by the federal government, including staff at the Department of Defense and schools have their information freely made available to Equifax. The reason for this is to allow the credit bureau to have the latest information about the working population and in turn some of the firms that provide the information also pay Equifax to collate it. In 2009, Equifax said the data they own covered 30 percent of the U.S. working population, and it now says The Work Number is adding 12 million records annually . Larry Ponemon, a privacy expert who operates The Ponemon Institute expressed shock at firms selling data to debt collectors . At their end, Equifax sells some of the sensitive information to debt collectors. The investigation by NBCNews.com sought comment from Equifax and they declined to be interviewed. However, the firm confirmed that it shares 'employment data' with financial service and debt collecting companies, but that it does so in compliance with Fair Credit Reporting Act guidelines. 'In all cases, these entities must have a permissible purpose to request employment information,' Equifax spokesman Timothy Klein said to NBCNews.com. He added that consumers allow third parties the right to access data 'at the time of application' for credit. 'A consumer grants verifiers (creditors) and their assigned debt collectors the right to verify employment should the consumer default on their account,' he said. The reason why The Work Number has become so popular is because it gives companies a simple way to outsource the employment verification of staff. Firms dislike the drain on human resources that human resource departments endure through confirming references when a former employee applies for a new job. Therefore, they have begun to use The Work Number, which was part of St. Louis based firm TALX until Equifax purchased it for $1.4 billion in 2007. However, The Work Number is not secretive - it allows prospective landlords a simple way to verify a prospective tenants income. It's the biggest privacy breach in our time, and it's legal and no one knows it's going on,' said Robert Mather, who operates an employment background company . Some consumers have found though that the level of information available online outstrips what they are comfortable with. NBCNews.com spoke with Kathy Sandy of Sommerville, New Jersey, who looked up her own Work Number report and found it was 22-pages long. It listed every paycheck she had received for years and the first page of the report helpfully lists 'verifiers who have requested your data in the past 24-months.' Sandy saw that 'Pressler and Pressler' a law firm that specialises in debt collection was listed. 'I found out debt collectors can access this information, which is strange,' said Sandy. I assumed with The Work Number, for that information, you had to have a (passcode) … but they got in, and got it somehow without my consent.' In his statement to NBC News, Equifax spokesman Timothy Klein said that 'pay rate' information is shared with third parties, such as 'mortgage, auto and other financial services credit grantors.' He did though, deny that salary information is sold to debt collectors. 'Debt/Collection agencies may request employment information -- which may be nothing more than verifying that a consumer is working where they say they are – if it qualifies under permissible purpose,' he wrote in his statement to NBCNews.com. 'Collections agencies are not provided salary information.' Credit rating agencies are multi-billion corporations in the United States and affect the financial well-being of millions . This directly contradicts what Equifax CEO Richard Smith said in 2009, when he spoke about The Work Number. 'With FirstSearch and TALX we can provide information about a debtor’s location, income and employment,' said Smith in an interview published on NYSE Magazine’s website, referring to The Work Number’s former parent company. 'That can help prioritize which accounts to pursue first. If they’re employed, that business has a better shot at collecting what is owed to them.' To counter that, Klein said that Smith misspoke when he described TALX's services and said that salary information is not sold to debt collectors. Robert Mather has worked in the emplyment data business for over two decades and said that if American's thought that their employers gave away personal information they would be shocked. 'The story here is how (The Work Number) is getting this information,' said Mather. 'When people find out, no respectable employer will continue to do this.' Robert Mather has worked in the emplyment data business for over two decades and said that if American's thought that their employers gave away personal information they would be shocked . NBCNews.com spoke to Larry Ponemon, a privacy expert who operates The Ponemon Institute. He expressed shock at firms selling data to debt collectors. 'Are you joking? Oh my god, I'm shocked,' said Ponemon. 'This is unbelievably scary. I consider payroll information very sensitive and private.' 'If the public knew about this, there would be such outrage,' he said. 'It's just ... really depressing.' Currently, data brokers are under two separate congressional investigations and the Federal Trade Commission announced in December that it had begun an inquiry into how brokers obtain their information. However, agencies which report credit ratings, such as The Work Number are considered separate from data brokers and are governed by special rules. It is therse separate rules that are what Equifax operates its salary information under said Katrina Blodgett, a lawyer with the Federal Trade Commission. 'It’s not as easy as it should be to say whether debt collectors can get your consumer reports, because it depends on the circumstance,' she said, adding that she believed Equifax could have the right to sell the salary information to debt collectors because it is part of a credit report. 'There are special restrictions on how credit reports can be used in hiring decisions, but there are no special restrictions on how employment reports (such as salary information) is used for non-employment purposes.' 'They are a credit bureau. They sell credit information to lenders.'","Over 190 million employment and salary records of American citizens have been shared by their employers with credit rating agencies .

Bryan Wright admitted assaulting his wife of almost 30 years, Lillian, at their home last month after the row over the remote control. His own barrister told Darlington Magistrates' Court: 'He had been watching cricket all afternoon, it was an exciting match, in the final overs. Bryan Wright admitted assaulting wife Lillian after she changed channels while he was watching cricket on TV (stock photo) 'He went out of the room, came back, and the channel had changed.  He saw red and acted completely inappropriately.' The assault happened while Wright was believed to be watching an IPL 20-over match broadcast on ITV4 between Royal Challengers Bangalore and Delhi Daredevils which went right to the wire. The 72-year-old grabbed his wife by the collar of her dressing gown, prosecutor Joanne Hesse told the court yesterday. She said: 'Lillian turned the channel over when he left the room and this resulted in a verbal altercation. 'He forced her up from her seat, repeatedly swearing at her, saying ""I will kill you"". Wright pleaded guilty to the assault, but disputed the prosecution's version of events.

He told police that he felt the . channel-changing had been unfair, and insisted he had neither hit her . with the remote control nor threatened to kill her. Mrs Hesse said: 'The prosecution would suggest that there was a weapon used, namely the remote control, however there was a lack of pre-meditation.' Mrs Wright fled to a neighbour's house, after which police were called and her husband was arrested. Tracey Kyle, mitigating, said: 'This was an act of domestic violence and while there were no injuries, it still would have been very frightening for Mrs Wright and he accepts that.' She added that the couple, who had not long got back together at the time of the assault on April 16, were now separated with no plans to reconcile. Wright, of Darlington, was given a three-year conditional discharge and ordered to pay £85 costs and a £15 victim surcharge.","Bryan Wright grabbed Lillian by her dressing gown and 'said ""I'll kill you'''

Siobhain McDonagh accepted 'very substantial' damages and a public apology at the High Court today . A Labour MP has demanded The Sun's editor be sacked after his fellow politician accepted 'very substantial damages'  from the paper, who accessed text messages from her stolen mobile phone. Chris Bryant MP demanded that Dominic Mohan be sacked after the newspaper apologised to Siobhain McDonagh, whose text messages were accessed by the paper. He wrote on Twitter: 'Surely Dominic Mohan should be sacked,' after a judge in the High Court, London heard that in October 2010 Ms McDonagh's private mobile telephone was stolen from her car in south west London. The MP for Rhondda furiously Tweeted after David Sherborne, representing the MP, told Mr Justice Vos how Ms McDonagh had learned of the the paper's activities. Mr Sherborne said that in June last year police notified her that they had 'obtained evidence that The Sun newspaper had accessed her text messages from about October 2010 and therefore appeared to have accessed and/or acquired her mobile phone'. In a separate case, former boxer Chris . Eubank has turned down a 'derisory' £21,000 offer to settle his phone . hacking claims against the News of the World. The MP for Mitcham and Morden since 1997, assistant whip and private secretary to Dr John Reid whilst he was Home Secretary and Minister for Defence, was told by police in June last year that the Sun had accessed her text messages. She was 'extremely concerned about this and wanted to know what had happened to her private and confidential information as well as her mobile telephone,' said Mr Sherborne. She won a court order last October banning publication of her private messages and for delivery up of her phone. Chris Bryant called for Dominic Mohan, the editor of The Sun, to be sacked after Ms McDonagh accepted a 'substantial sum' Ms McDonagh said an agreement was made several weeks ago but finalised in court today.She said: 'I'm in public life and I don't have a hang-up about my own privacy, but my family and constituents who had contacted me and given personal views were subjected to people seeing it. That made me feel very uneasy. 'As an MP, people tell me all sorts of things, people give their personal information and they believe that you will do the right thing with it. That wasn't for anyone's eyes. 'I was a government whip, I had lots of phone numbers and had then exposed all those people to having their privacy invaded, and that troubled me.' News Group admitted there was 'serious wrongdoing and misuse of her private information and her mobile telephone,' said Mr Sherborne. Dinah Rose QC, who was speaking on behalf of the defendants, said that it was accepted that her mobile phone 'should not have been accessed and used and furthermore accept that there has been a serious misuse of her private information'. The announcement of Ms McDonagh's settlement came during the 14th case management conference relating to civil damages actions brought by scores of people from all walks of life over the phone- hacking scandal. Chris Bryant's tweet demanding that Dominic Mohan be sacked after the newspaper apologised for accessing Siobhain McDonagh's texts . New Group said there had been 'serious wrongdoing and misuse of Siobhain McDonagh's private information and her mobile telephone' At the beginning of proceedings today, . Hugh Tomlinson QC told the court that there had been 'substantial . developments' since the previous case management hearing. A . number of further arrests had been made 'in what the Metropolitan . Police Service have characterised in their public statement as a new . conspiracy to intercept voice mail messages'. He added that it involved 'potentially hundreds of victims'. Mr Tomlinson, who represents claimants in the action, said it was 'not known at the moment how many more claims may be issued'. Mr Sherborne said the defendants - the publishers and/or owners of The Sun - had agreed to pay Ms McDonagh 'very substantial damages' and her legal costs. Dinah Rose QC, for the defendants, told the judge: 'Through me they offer their unreserved apology to the claimant for what has happened. Chris Eubank has turned down the 'derisory' offer of £21,000 . 'Furthermore they have undertaken to . the court not to use any information so obtained nor to access or . attempt to access by unlawful means the claimant's private information.' Mr . Sherborne said that 'in these circumstances the claimant has obtained . significant protection and vindication of her privacy rights and she is . therefore content not to pursue this matter any further'. Former . World boxing champion Chris Eubank has turned down a 'derisory' £21,000 . offer to settle his phone hacking claims against the News of the World. The 46-year-old former middleweight and super middleweight champion told the High Court today he was looking forward to the 'gargantuan battle ahead of me ' with News International. He said he had refused to accept the £21,000 offered in settlement: 'I am not accepting their derisory offer because they have taken everything from me. 'They have destroyed my marriage and I have not been able to care for my children for eight years. That is why I am fighting News International.' Dinah Rose QC asked the judge to strike out all references to the £21,000 and his 'unsubstantiated and scandalous claims.' But the figure had already been tweeted from the court and the judge told her he had tried to stop Mr Eubank speaking 'gratuitously' but added 'what is done is done.' The former boxer alleged the newspaper had 'made a mockery of the justice system' by deleting information relating to him. He accused them of 'hiding behind a veneer of corporate respectability' and said a clear and unflinching message should be made that justice and the laws of Great Britain should not be destroyed by 'lies and deceit.' The judge made clear to him that his case was only at a preliminary stage and the court was not the place for him to make a speech. Hugh Tomlinson QC for the claimants against the News of the World said 145 of the original 167 claims had been settled of the 23 remaining, including that of Chris Eubank , with two more applying to be joined. News Group had called for an April 1st cut off of any more compensation claims, and had agreed to pay a 'substantial sum' towards the legal costs of the case so far already estimated in excess of £5m. This is the latest in a series of settlements with the Duchess of York accepting undisclosed damages last month, along with actors Hugh Grant and Christopher Ecclestone , singer James Blunt and actress and singer Kerry Katona. Some of the biggest payouts include singer Charlotte Church and her parents who received £600,000 between them and the parents of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler said to have received £3m. Other hacking settlements include £130,000 to film star Jude Law, £68,000 to former England star Paul Gascoigne, £40,000 to comedian Steve Coogan, Liberal Democrat deputy leader Simon Hughes received £45,000, former MP George Galloway was handed £25,000, Tony Blair's former communication's director Alistair Campbell, accepted undisclosed 'substantial' damages, and sports agent Sky Andrew received £75,000.

A New Mexico woman will reunite with her Costa Rican family Thursday almost 40 years after she said her father took her away from her mother. Naomi Martinez, 45, of Albuquerque, N.M., said she spent most of her life thinking her mother, brother and sisters abandoned her until she was contacted by her estranged family online. 'I grew up thinking they didn't want me and that they abandoned me,' Martinez told MailOnline. Time: Naomi Martinez has reunited with her estranged family in Costa Rica after 40 years . Heartbroken: Naomi Martinez said her father, Curtis Dilas, left, took her from her mother, Erlinda Compos Carrillo, right, when she was around five years old and brought her to the U.S. for medical attention . Memories: Naomi Martinez will see her mother and sister again Thursday . She said her father, Curtis Dilas, brought her to New Mexico when she was about five to get medical attention for a burn. Martinez now thinks her father only used the burn, which she sustained from an oven at three-years-old, as an excuse to take her away from her mother, brother and sisters in Costa Rica. 'My father had to have a signed affidavit from a lawyer that allowed him to take me out,' she told KRQE. 'The way he got around that was he told my mother, ""I'm going to take her to the United States to get her treated by a doctor up there.""' She told MailOnline her father would taunt her with the affidavit, which her mother had to sign, using it as proof that her mother didn't want her—which she now knows wasn't the case. 'She did it because she thought she was helping me,' Martinez said. Reunited: Naomi Martinez' father made her believe that her mother, Erlinda Compos Carrillo, seen here with Martinez before she was brought to the U.S., had abandoned her . 'I thought she abandoned me and didn't want me and was glad to have me out of her life,' Martinez told KRQE. Martinez it was difficult growing up without a mother. 'I would look for women to take the place to be a mother figure when I was little,' she said. But Martinez acknowledged it was difficult for her mother and family in Costa Rica, too. 'I feel so bad. It really gets me emotional thinking about how much she would have gone through,' Martinez said. 'I look at my own daughter and I couldnt imagine going through my life and not watching her grow up.' Connection: After Naomi Martinez got a Facebook profile, her estranged family contacted her . Martinez joined Facebook in 2011 and a few months after joining, her oldest sister sent her a couple of messages. She said a friend she met volunteering at a local cultural center found out about Martinez' family history and reached out to her sister in Costa Rica, prompting the exchange. At first, Martinez was hesitant to respond. 'I kind of had my life already made,' she said. 'I didn't know if I wanted to open that up.' Martinez responded after her sister's third message and discovered her family didn't abandon her but has been trying to find her for decades. 'The first time that I heard my mother's voice was something really emotional for me because she told me, ""I still see you as a little girl,""' Martinez told KRQE. Estranged: Naomi Martinez said she hasn't spoken with her father, Curtis Dilas, right, in many years . Martinez will pick up her mother and one of her sisters from the airport in Albuquerque Thursday. They will stay with her through July. 'It's been a whole roller coaster of emotions,' Martinez said. 'Anxiety, nervousness and anticipation.' Martinez now has four daughters of her own and is married. She told MailOnline she's having a joint celebration for her daughter's 18th birthday and her mother's 80th birthday, which is coming up next month. She said she hasn't spoken to her father for at least 10 years, but that she doesn't have any animosity toward him. 'I don't think he did it completely out of malice,' she said. 'For the most part I think he did it because he thought he was doing the right thing.' Martinez said she would be open to reconnecting with her father, too.","Naomi Martinez said her father brought her to the U.S. from Costa Rica when she was five for medical attention—which she never got .

A string of high-profile public figures including Russell Brand and Maggie Gyllenhaal are fronting a fresh campaign to persuade the public that charges levelled against U.S. military whistleblower Bradley Manning are unjust. In a new clip uploaded to YouTube this week Manning's supporters take turns to condemn the case against the Army intelligence analyst who leaked millions of classified documents. It has been released as part of the 'I am Bradley Manning' campaign, which is attempting to galvanise his supporters around that same slogan. Scroll down for video . I am Bradley Manning: Comedian turned actor Russell Brand appears in the new video condemning the charges against the U.S. military whistleblower who passed millions of documents to WikiLeaks . I am also Bradley Manning: Hollywood actress Maggie Gyllenhaal is another of the well-known figures that feature . Manning's trial is now in its third week, following three years of pre-trial detention in conditions that have been criticised by many human rights groups. The 25-year-old Oklahoma native has acknowledged giving information to WikiLeaks, but said it did not harm national security. He faces numerous charges, including aiding the enemy, which carries a potential death sentence. The video intersperses clips from the . infamous Collateral Murder video leaked by Manning among appearances by . the likes of director Oliver Stone, Pentagon Papers whistleblower Daniel . Ellsberg and gay rights in the military activist Dan Choi. From one whistleblower to another: Daniel Ellsberg, the military analyst turned whistleblower behind the 1971 leak of the Pentagon Papers, has also leant his support to the campaign . Luminaries: Director Oliver Stone, who has been critical of U.S. foreign policy, also appears in the video . Those commenting tell of how Manning's revelations 'ignited [a] chain of social action' including the Arab Spring revolutions and mass opposition to officially sanctioned torture by U.S. military personnel. A statement accompanying the video says: 'Amidst courtroom secrecy, whistleblower and Nobel Peace Prize nominee Bradley Manning is on trial after three years of confinement. 'The information that Bradley gave to the public has been a catalyst for pro-democracy movements in the Arab world, exposed the unjust detainment of innocent people at Guantanamo Bay, shown us the true human cost of our wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and changed journalism forever. 'There is no evidence that anyone died . as a result of the leaked information, yet Bradley faces life in prison . or possibly death. 'The . greatest charge against him is that of “aiding the enemy,” a capital . offence. As the public who benefited from this information, does that . make us the enemy? What price will future whistleblowers pay?' Facing potential execution: Manning is escorted out of a courthouse in Fort Meade, Maryland, on Monday, as his court-martial enters its third week . In the latest from the Manning trial a . federal judge in Baltimore said yesterday that she's satisfied for now . with measures the military has taken to release documents related to the . court-martial. Lawyers for the New York-based Center for Constitutional Rights and other groups, including The Associated Press, have complained for more than a year that court documents related to the military case were being released too slowly, if at all. Earlier this month, however, the Army put the vast majority of the documents online. The Army also promised to be forthcoming with the documents as Manning's trial, which began June 3, continues at Maryland's Fort Meade. The documents are being posted for the public and press on an Internet site. But lawyers for the centre said they weren't satisfied. One argued in court on Monday that the Army's turnaround time to release new documents - a goal of one to two days - was too long for journalists covering the trial. He also objected to redactions and sought access to transcripts or audio recordings of past proceedings. But on Wednesday, the judge in the case, Ellen Hollander, sided with the Army. In a 42-page ruling she wrote of the lag time in releasing documents that there was 'no indication that such a brief delay is unreasonable.' And she said she wouldn't order the Army to speed up the release transcripts and audio of past proceedings because it would be 'a serious and unwarranted interference in the operation of the court-martial.' She also agreed certain redactions were appropriate. A lawyer for the Center for Constitutional Rights, Shayana Kadidal, said the decision was 'disappointing' and that the centre is considering its options.","High-profile figures take turns to explain why they think the charges against Manning are unjust .

The BBC's Adrian van Klaveren claimed almost £400 when his holiday was cancelled in the aftermath of the Jimmy Savile sex abuse scandal . A senior BBC executive who earns a six-figure salary claimed almost £400 when his holiday was cancelled in the aftermath of the Jimmy Savile sex abuse scandal. Adrian Van Klaveren, who in June 2012 had a total remuneration of £193,150, claimed £387.50 for a 'Cancelled holiday to return to work during Jimmy Savile issue'. A former controller of BBC Radio 5 Live, Van Klaveren left the station in December in the wake of the Pollard Report into aspects of the Jimmy Savile scandal. He had temporarily headed the chain of command in news at the time of a bungled BBC2 Newsnight report into child abuse in north Wales, which led to Lord McAlpine mistakenly being linked to it. It led to the BBC making a financial settlement with the Tory peer. He is now in charge of the BBC coverage of the 100th anniversary of the First World War. The expenses claims, which were published today, also reveal that current head of television Danny Cohen was given a box of win at Christmas by Mrs Merton star Caroline Aherne. Cohen, who at that time was BBC One controller, gave the wine to staff at the station. The total expenses claimed by senior BBC staff has actually risen by almost a fifth compared to this time last year. New figures show the expenses bill of £206,401 for the latest quarter for which figures are available, had gone up by 19 per cent, compared with the equivalent period a year earlier which accounted for £174,041. A BBC spokeswoman said: 'The majority of these expenses are unavoidable routine costs incurred in running a major international broadcasting organisation. 'Whilst there will inevitably be fluctuation in spend from year to year we are mindful that we are spending public money and are working hard to keep these costs to a minimum.'

More than 250 foreign criminals including killers, paedophiles, rapists and a terrorist were allowed to stay in the country last year on human rights grounds without Government lawyers challenging their cases in court. Their applications to stay were simply rubber stamped by a Home Office official. The number of such cases has increased five-fold in the past three years. It has raised fears that some appeal cases are not being challenged in the courts when they should be. Worrying: Killers and rapists were among 250 foreign criminals who should have been deported at the end of their prison sentences but were instead allowed to stay in Britain without their cases being considered by a court . However officials insisted it was pointless fighting appeals they were bound to lose. They . said the real problem was immigration rules that allowed too many . claims to succeed under Article 8 of the Human Rights Act, which . guarantees the right to respect for private and family life . Action: Home Secretary Theresa May last year announced a crackdown on use of the 'right to a family life' defence to avoid deportation . A . freedom of information request revealed more than 600 human rights . appeal cases were approved by the Home Office in the past four years. The number has risen from 56 in 2008 to 80 in 2009, 217 in 2010 and 250 last year, it was reported yesterday. On . top of the 250 cases that were not challenged, 409 offenders were . allowed to stay last year after a judge approved their appeal against . deportation.

He added: ‘There is no point in wasting taxpayers’ money contesting cases where we were advised we would lose. ‘We examined each claim but case law based on the old rules meant the courts were highly likely to uphold them. ‘That’s why we changed the rules last month to help us remove criminals who try to use Article 8 to dodge deportation. ‘As . a result, we believe that  we will see fewer cases where  the .

Casey Anthony could be at risk of 'disappearing' if the defamation cases against her continue, according to her lawyers. The 27-year-old from Florida has been accused of slandering two people by implicating them in the death of her daughter Caylee, whom she was cleared of murdering. But she is seeking to have their lawsuits dropped, claiming she does not have enough money to pay damages. At risk: Casey Anthony could disappear if she is forced to defend against lawsuits, according to her attorneys . Anthony is being sued by Roy Kronk, the workman who found Caylee's body after the two-year-old had been missing for six months, who says he has been accused of wrongdoing over the toddler's death. She also faces a suit from Zenaida Gonzalez, a woman with the same name as a fictional nanny who Anthony originally claimed had kidnapped Caylee. However, both cases were paused in January when Anthony filed for bankruptcy. Her lawyers are now seeking to have the suits dismissed, filing papers in Orange County Circuit Court claiming that Anthony could go into hiding as a result of her legal struggles, according to the Orlando Sentinel. Daughter: Anthony was acquitted of murdering two-year-old Caylee, who went missing for six months . 'She will either defend the cases or be forced to default because she has no money,' they wrote. 'She will be lampooned in the press. The death threats will again increase. 'She will be forced to find new accommodations, or just simply disappear and say it is not worth the fight anymore.' Anthony, who was widely vilified at the time of her trial for murder, has barely been seen in public since being acquitted of killing her daughter. She claims to be nearly $800,000 in debt thanks to heavy legal fees, and a bankruptcy trustee has sought to sell off the rights to her life story in order to pay her bills. Although Anthony was found not guilty of murder in 2011, she was convicted of lying to police after it emerged that she had made up her explanation of why Caylee was missing. Last month, the trial judge said that he was shocked by Anthony's acquittal and claimed that there was enough evidence to convict her of killing her daughter.","Anthony is being sued for defamation but cases have been on hold .

At the ready: Prince William may have to arrive by helicopter for the birth of his first child in London . Father-to-be Prince William may have to rush to hospital via helicopter for the arrival of his first child. William, 30, will still be working as a Search and Rescue pilot at RAF Valley on Anglesey, when his wife the Duchess of Cambridge is due to give birth in mid-July. But sources have told MailOnline that she is particularly keen to have her family around her in the hospital. Significantly, our sources strongly hinted that Kate's family – particularly her mother, Carole Middleton, and sister, Pippa - are likely to be present at the hospital during her labour. Remarkably, this means that the Middleton family may learn the sex of the new-born future king or queen before even the present Queen herself. William is also said to be determined to make it, following in the footsteps of his own father who broke royal tradition to be with his wife, Diana, Princess of Wales, for the birth of both their children. Previous heirs have been born at home or Buckingham Palace. As a result, plans are currently being formulated by palace aides to whisk him down to London by helicopter so he can be present at his son or daughter’s birth. But as any new parent knows, babies have an uncanny knack of making an appearance at the most inconvenient times and the journey is likely to take several hours even with the help of a private aircraft. ‘He very much plans to be at the birth but between now and then will also be on and off duty in North Wales, meaning he might have to get there rather swiftly,’ said a source. ‘It could be by train or car if he is up in Anglesey but should a helicopter be available then that is also a strong possibility.’ How will he make it on time? Palace aides are putting plans in place to make sure Prince William gets to hospital for the birth of his first child . Anxious wait: Expectant father Prince William will continue his shifts as a Search and Rescue pilot in Anglesey as he awaits news of his first child . Close: Sources have strongly hinted that Kate's family, especially mother Carole and sister Pippa, will be present at the hospital . Support: Kate is keen to have her mother Carole, left, and sister Pippa, right, around her because her husband William may be on duty when the baby arrives . Helicopters aside, the future king is not expecting any special treatment and is due to take just two weeks’ statutory paternity leave – for which he will be paid £136.78 a week – before returning to his normal shift pattern. His wife, however, will definitely not return with him to their home on Anglesey with the new baby. A palace spokesman said today that there was ‘still some discussion’ about where Kate and their new-born will be based as a result. But the Daily Mail has already revealed that she plans to move in with her parents at their £4.8 million Berkshire mansion for around six weeks after William returns to work as builders are still finishing their new apartment at Kensington Palace. Details of the royal birth plans indicate that although they are a very modern royal couple in many ways, William and Kate are largely sticking to tradition when it comes to their first child. Traditional: Kate and William, pictured during the Trooping of the Colour last weekend - her final public appearance before the birth - are making plans for the arrival of their first child . Blossoming: The Duchess of Cambridge has dazzled during her pregnancy, right, in April, and left, during her last public appearance before giving birthday at the Queen's birthday celebrations . Royal princess? The Duchess of Cambridge names The Royal Princess ship at Southampton last week by smashing a bottle of champagne on its hull . Having a giggle: As the champagne smashed on the . ship Kate laughed and jumped a little, and despite her loose coat she . couldn't hide how pregnant she was . Modern fathers: William, left, is likely to follow his father Prince Charles, right, who broke royal tradition to be with Princess Diana for the birth of their children . Like the late Princess Diana before her, Kate has chosen the Lindo Wing at St Mary’s where a natural birth, staying in a private suite, is likely to cost up to £10,000. William became the first future monarch in history to be born in a hospital when he was delivered there on 21st June 1982, followed by his brother, Harry. The Royal Household’s official Surgeon-Gynaecologist, Alan Farthing, the former fiancé of murdered television presenter Jill Dando, is by happy co-incidence a consultant gynaecologist at St Mary’s and will be assisting with the labour. He will be led by the Queen’s own Surgeon-Gynaecologist, Marcus Setchell. It is understood that contingency plans have been put in place with other hospitals, such as the Royal Berkshire in Reading, in case the Duchess goes into labour when visiting her parents. Experts: The Queen’s own Surgeon-Gynaecologist, Marcus Setchell, . left, will lead the treatment of the Duchess supported by the Royal . Household’s official Surgeon-Gynaecologist, Alan Farthing, right . Nightmare journey: Father-to-be Prince William may have to travel from Anglesey to St Mary's hospital in Paddington, west London (pictured), to see Kate give birth . Princess Diana gave birth to her eldest son in the hospital's Lindo Wing, and Kate will do the same 31 years later . History: The new heir will arrive in the same hospital where Prince William was born to Prince Charles and Princess Diana in 1982 . But a source told the Mail: 'As was . demonstrated when the Duchess fell ill with a pregnancy-related sickness . last year while staying with her parents in Berkshire, she can she be . whisked in a private car to central London within an hour. 'So it is very . unlikely she will give birth anywhere else than St Mary’s, quite . frankly.' While palace aides are keen to retain Kate’s 'dignity' as a woman in labour, they acknowledge the fact that social media such as Twitter will make it almost impossible to keep her admittance to hospital a secret unless she is smuggled in. But although both Buckingham Palace and Clarence House have their own Twitter accounts on which details of royal events are frequently now broken, it will most definitely not be the preferred medium to announce the new royal baby. Instead a formal notice on a piece of creamy A4 size Buckingham Palace-headed paper, signed by the medical staff who have assisted the Duchess, will be brought out of the Lindo’s front entrance by a press officer. It will then be handed to a waiting driver and driven through the streets of London – escorted by police outriders - to the Privy Purse Door at the front of Buckingham Palace. There it will then be placed on an easel, last used to announce Prince William’s birth, by the main gates in the palace forecourt. This will signify to an eager public that a new royal baby has been born. Same again: On June 22 1982 a sign on an easel was placed at the gates of Buckingham Palace announcing the birth, the previous day, of Prince William. The same will happen this year with his child . Joy: William, pictured with the Queen on Monday at the annual Garter Ceremony at Windsor Castle, will be with his wife for the birth, even if he is flown in by helicopter from his Welsh RAF station .

Flight 931 was on its way from San Francisco to London on June 16 when crew made the unfortunate discovery. Their response however has sent the story viral - as flight crew, apparently without irony, placed napkins in the bathroom as a makeshift solution. The branded napkins read: 'Fly by the tips of your fingers.' Improvised: United Airlines crew left these napkins (with an ill-timed slogan) in the onboard bathroom after they ran out of toilet paper on an 11-hour flight from San Francisco to London . The picture was posted on the message board Flyertalk by someone called SFO_Runner. He wrote: 'Apparently, they ran out in one lav half-way home and couldn't bother to transfer a roll from another. 'And before you ask, I went BACK to the lav AFTER I saw this. Didn't have the phone with me the first time.' In a statement, a United Airlines spokesman told MailOnline: 'The aircraft ran low on toilet tissue and our crew improvised and provided customers with paper napkins. 'We apologize to our customers on this flight for the inconvenience and would like the opportunity to welcome them back.' The company came last in a customer service survey released in April. Uncomfortable: Passengers were faced with no toilet paper on an 11-hour United Airlines flight . United Airlines is currently facing a lawsuit filed last month by an 18-year-old California high school student who claimd that flight attendants failed to address a passenger who was masturbating in front of her. Monica Amestoy, a senior at Flintridge Sacred Heart Academy, said the incident took place on October 21 aboard United Flight 771 while she was traveling back to LA after taking part in a debate tournament in New York. Then-17-year-old Amestoy said she was terrified and disgusted seeing the stranger pleasuring himself across the aisle from her, and she immediately notified a flight attendant. But she said that 'to her horror,' no action was taken against the passenger because he could not be relocated. The Amestoy family’s lawsuit, filed against United Airlines and United Continental Holdings, accuses the company of negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress and false imprisonment, and seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. In response to the suit, the airline said in a statement: 'The comfort and security of our customers is our top priority, and we will closely review this complaint when we receive it.'",Flight 931 was on its way from San Francisco to London on June 16 when crew made the unfortunate discovery .

Welden responds: 'Oh God I want to die … Are you serious Remee please don't do this I beg you.' 'Don't do what? Take responsibility for my actions?' Miss Lee responds. 'This isn't about us anymore. It is not it's fault, why should it have to die? You must not be who I thought you were if you are asking me to murder our child.' Welden replies: 'I can't I hate myself now. Fine I can't do this I am destroyed.' Federal prosecutors revealed on Tuesday that Welden, who is being held without bail, is now under investigation for witness tampering and mail fraud. He was recorded on jailhouse phone calls threatening to smear Miss Lee's reputation. He also told Miss Fillinger that she didn't have to testify in the case, according to court documents. Happier time: Andrew Welden, pictured with his ex-girlfriend Remee Lee, allegedly gave her pills and claimed they were antibiotics. But hours later, she was rushed to hospital and lost the baby . Long-term: Miss Fillinger filed an affidavit asking judge release Welden on bail. She said that the couple had been together for seven years and were talking about buying a house together and getting married . Welden was arrested in May and accused of tricking his girlfriend into taking the abortion drug Cytotec by changing the label and telling her it was an antibiotic. Authorities say he forged his father's signature on a prescription for the drug. Miss Lee had had an ultrasound at Dr Stephen Welden's office, which confirmed she was pregnant. John Welden told her his father had prescribed her antibiotics and gave her a bottle of the abortion drugs. Miss Lee told authorities she never called the doctor's office to confirm the prescription because she trusted Welden. She took a bill on the way to work and immediately began to bleed and have pain. She lost the baby at the hospital. It was there, that a doctor saw the pills Miss Lee took and told her they were meant for inducing pregnancy - or abortion. Federal prosecutors allege Welden never wanted Miss Lee to have his baby - even though she was determined to keep the pregnancy and raise the child.

Welden worked as an office manager at one of his father's clinics and is attending college for sports medicine. He also had a long-term on-again-off-again girlfriend - Miss Fillinger. Court documents reveal that she had become suspicious after she found Miss Lee's positive pregnancy test and prenatal vitamins in his car. He lied and told her that both items belonged to his sister. Federal authorities also released a transcript of a conversation Miss Lee had with Welden. After she lost the fetus in the hospital, she went to police and agreed have her conversations with Welden recorded. Welden told Miss Lee that Miss Fillinger, his other girlfriend, had found out about their relationship and was 'furious.' Miss Lee says: 'If you wanted to go be with Tara, that's fine. Go be with Tara. 'I woulda had my kid and I woulda been fine with that... woulda told my parents it was someone else's. I wouldn't have bothered you for money. I wouldn't have bothered you at all.'

Food safety officials have recalled 22,737lb of ground beef over fears that it could be contaminated with E.coli. Although no illnesses have been reported, the ground beef was classed as a Class I health hazard meaning it was probable that the meat would cause serious health problems. The food, with a sell by date of June 14, was flagged up during a routine inspection at the National Beef Packing company in Liberal, Kansas. Health fears: Nearly 23,000lb of ground beef from Kansas has been recalled after an inspector found E.coli . The United States Food Safety and Inspection Service is concerned that some shoppers may still have the potentially contaminated food in their freezers. An inspector found E.coli in a sample from the company during a routine inspection, which led to a voluntary recall of the meat.

It was the catch of a lifetime. The daughter of former Yankee legend Joe Torre caught a baby who was dangling from the awning of a building in Brooklyn on Wednesday. Cristina Torre, 44, spotted the 1-year-old boy hanging from the front of a store on 3rd Avenue and 92nd street at around 10 a.m. As she was calling 911, the baby fell, but he landed safety in Torre's outstretched arms, witnesses said. 'The woman caught the baby,' onlooker Kristen Bramsen, 48, told The New York Daily News. 'The baby was shaken. Everyone was going up to the woman and hugging her. I hugged her.' She added in an interview with The New York Post: 'I really think the baby would have been dead if it wasn't for the woman.' Police later determined the little boy, whose name hasn't been revealed, slipped through an open window after pushing out a piece of cardboard that had been placed next to an air conditioner at his second floor apartment. According to The Post, the parents were fast asleep when the child fell, though both - Sam Miller, 23, and Tiffany Demetria, 24 - were handcuffed and taken into custody by police after the frightening incident. 'It took a long time for them to get to the parents. I looked over and the father was on the ground clutching his heart,' Bramsen told The Post. They face charges of endangering the welfare of a child and neglect and their three other children, aged 2, 3 and 5, have been placed in state care. Proud: Former New York Yankees manager Joe Torre, pictured left, said he was very proud of his daughter who 'always had good hands' Quick-thinking: Torre, pictured left and right, heroically caught the unnamed child while calling 911 . A neighbor described the parents as 'gypsies' who regularly read tarot cards in the street. The baby was taken to Lutheran Hospital though just for observation. At Yankee Stadium on Wednesday, Joe Torre told The Post his daughter's magic catch was as good as anything he'd ever accomplished while managing the Yankees between 1996 and 2007. 'No question this ranks right up there with all that's happened to me,' said the 72-year-old who brought the team to four World Series titles and is now MLB's executive vice president of baseball operations. Lucky escape: The little boy slipped through the window of his family's second floor apartment and landed on the awning of the store, pictured . 'Your children, that's your proudest moments and when they are responsible and caring and all that stuff it is a proud moment, especially in today's world where we seem to glorify bad things. I am just so proud of her.' He added that while his daughter didn't play a lot of sports growing up 'she always had good hands.' Joe Torre had a more than 17-year career as a catcher, first baseman and third baseman for teams including the Atlanta Braves, the New York Mets and the St. Louis Cardinals.","Cristina Torre, 44, spotted the 1-year-old boy hanging from the front of a store on 3rd Avenue and 92nd street at around 10 a.m .

The defendants in a father-son prostitution case were acquitted of sex trafficking Wednesday but found guilty of laundering millions of dollars and of promoting prostitution, leading at least one of their 'happy hookers' to weep for her pimps. Three self-described prostitutes took the stand as character witnesses during the trial, all of whom described Vincent George Sr. and Vincent George Jr, their admitted pimps, as caring men who took good care of them. The verdict means the two men, though cleared of charges they coerced the women into their sex business, could face up to 15 years for laundering millions of dollars through music recording and car service businesses. Desiree Ellis, a prostitute who testified that she and Vincent George Sr. would fight but then make up--and even called him a 'teddy bear' on the stand--was seen being comforted after the mixed verdict had been read.

The men's supporters in the courtroom initially cheered the verdict, but the gallery fell silent when Manhattan Judge Ruth Pickholtz announced convictions against the Georges. The pair showed no emotion aside from slight smiles as they were led back to jail in handcuffs. The father and son had faced up to 25-year terms on the sex-trafficking charges. Despite the mixed verdict, District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. called the outcome a victory. 'The goal of the prosecution was to dismantle a criminal enterprise from top to bottom,' he said. 'That goal has been achieved with the Georges. ... There is no fairy tale ending for these defendants.' Family affair: Father and son pimps Vincent George, Sr. and Jr. were acquitted on sex trafficking charges but found guilt of laundering millions of dollars and of promoting prostitution . Mixed victory: Howard Greenberg, pictured, defense lawyer for the father and son pimps and attorney David Epstein called the mixed verdict a victory . Defense attorneys - who called the . women working for their clients 'happy hookers' - also claimed victory, . adding that they planned to appeal the convictions. The verdict 'recognizes that people . have free will and the right to make choices whether or not you like . those choices,' David Epstein, the son's attorney, said of the . prostitutes. The loving relationship between pimps . and prostitutes 'was vindicated,' Epstein added. 'It's a moral victory . as well as a legal one.'

They were threatened with beatings when they didn't bring in as much . money as expected or were late to check in, according to wiretap . conversations played at trial. 'Bring me my (expletive) money right now and get your ass back to work,' the son said to one woman.

New Jersey Governor told students at a school in the state that he's a Dallas Cowboys fan. While talking to students at Samsel Upper Elementary School in Parlin, New Jersey, Governor Christie was asked which teams he supports. He revealed that he roots for the Knicks, Mets and Rangers. Scroll down for video... Sports fan: Governor Christie is a sports fan but when it comes to American Football he doesn't support the New York Jets or the Giants . Excuses: The Governor said that when he was growing up the New York area teams weren't very good, so he chose one that was - the Dallas Cowboys . 'Now the last answer is one of the things that gets all of my political advisers nervous,' Christie said. 'My favorite football team is not the New York Giants.' There was a stir in the assembly hall at hearing the news. 'It is not the New York Jets ... and it is not the Philadelphia Eagles,' Christie continued with the students on tenterhooks. Little chat: The Governor had already admitted to being a fan of the Cowboys -- as well as the more locally acceptable New York Mets, Knicks and Rangers -- back in 2010 . Glory supporter? Of course, there are plenty of other reasons why the Governor may be a keen supporter of the Dallas Cowboys... 'Get ready now. My favorite football team are the Dallas Cowboys ... which by the way is not the smartest thing for the Governor of New Jersey to want to be is a fan of the Dallas Cowboys.' There was uproar in the hall and the students booed loudly. Governor Christie could only shake his head as he listened in amusement. The governor explained that his father was a Giants fan but he grew up a fan of the Cowboys and Roger Staubach. 'The Giants and the Jets pretty much stunk when I was a kid,' Christie said. 'And my father was a Giants fan and I used to remember watching him when I was eight, nine-years-old. Every Sunday, he would watch the Giants and yell at the TV set. I used to think to myself, why would I want to root for a team that makes you angry? So I decided not to and the Cowboys were really good back then.' Christie's support of an out-of-state team may lead some to question how much he values loyalty in his life. Many Republicans took issue with the fact that Christie met with and praised President Obama just days before the 2012 election after Hurricane Sandy hit. Christie, a popular governor widely seen as a possible Republican contender in 2016, frustrated some in the Romney campaign who feared he had given what was a critical boost to Obama, a Democrat. 'If the president of United States comes here and he's willing to help my people and he does it then I'm gonna say nice things about him because he's earned it.' 'Obama provided help to my people at one of the worst crises that this state has ever faced,' Christie added. 'When somebody does a good job, they deserve credit.'","Governor: 'The Giants and the Jets pretty much stunk when I was a kid,'

For decades historians have tried to convince us that Vikings were nothing but peaceful traders and farmers. But now, historians in Copenhagan have shown that they were in fact the fearsome warriors we had previously thought them to be. Archaeologists behind ‘Viking’, an exhibition at the National Museum of Denmark, have explored the traditional idea of raiders and pillagers, inspiring fear wherever their longboats would take them. The massive warship would have held 100 men, and 36 pairs of oars. It is thought that only royalty could have afforded to pay for such a vessel . The exhibition was opened by Queen Margerethe of Denmark today, and will arrive in London next year to launch the British Museum’s new exhibition space. It focuses on the weaponry that Vikings would have used, such as swords, spears and arrows. Archaeologist and co-coordinator Anne Pedersen told the Guardian: The arrow shape did more damage. The wounds were bigger and more difficult to heal than a straight edged slit.’ Also featured is the longest Viking warship ever found.  At 36m in length, it is  surrounded by swords and battle axes, showing the power and fear that the warriors would have invoked. Organisers of the exhibition (right) decided to display as many Viking swords (left) as they could . The exhibition features jewellery and clothing from the period, showing the wealth that Vikings sought . Vikings were traders, farmers, raiders and mercenaries with many amassing large collections of gold . Characters like Hagar the Horrible given an impression of Vikings being friendlier than they perhaps were . Petersen said: ‘Some of my colleagues thought surely one sword is enough but I said no one can ever have too many swords.’ Made from oak felled in 1025 in Oslo, it would have held 100 men and 36 pairs of oars. The ship was found in Roskilde, home to a museum that was built to hold a fleet of Viking boats that were sunk 1,000 years ago to protect the harbour. The vessel is thought to have taken 30,000 hours of labour to make, and it is likely that only royalty would have had the resources to pay for such a vessel. Historians point to King Cnut the Great as a possible owner, as he conquered Norway in 1028 and England in 1016. The . exhibition, which is the largest of its kind in 20 years, also explores . the idea of Vikings as mercenaries, travelling to Byzantium and . Jerusalem. Other objects . featured include pieces of amber and jewellery incorporating Byzantine . coins, and a pair of gold brooches created in the shape of tiny animals. An . inscribed silver collar from Norway suggests that they came to Frisia . to ‘exchange war garments from them’ but it is suggested that collars . were used for slavery. Iron slave collars from Dublin show that the . Vikings sought more than gold and silver. The jewellery and metalwork on display shows the intricate carvings and designs favoured at the time . The exhibition, featuring Viking artwork, will travel to the British Museum next year . The exhibition takes in artifacts from collections across Europe, including the Lewis chessmen carvings from Britain. Organisers hope that it will help show all wides of Viking life. Petersen added: Probably only a small percentage of the Vikings ever went to sea on raiding parties, but I think that those who stayed home would have told stories of great warriors, great ships and great swords.’","New exhibition explores the fearsome and dangerous side of Viking warriors .

Kyle Dube, 20, of Orono, entered the pleas during his arraignment at the Penobscot Judicial Center. Defense lawyer Stephen Smith requested a psychological evaluation for Dube to determine if he is competent to stand trial. The 20-year-old suspect was returned to jail after the brief court appearance, which was attended by the slain teen's mother, who sat in the front row dressed in a yellow T-shirt with her daughter's picture and clutched the girl's stuffed teddy bear in her hands. Kyle Dube, 20, who faces one count each of kidnapping and murder in the death of Nichole Cable, told Superior Court Justice Ann Murray that he understood the charges against him when he entered the two pleas . Denial of guilt: Kyle Dube, 20, of Orono, Maine, seen here in June last year,  pleaded guilty to kidnapping and murdering Nichole Cable, right, who was last seen on May 12, 2013 . Disastrous plot: Kyle Dube, pictured in court this week, used a Facebook account to lure Nichole Cable from her home and kidnap her. He planned to stage a rescue so he could look like a hero . The presiding judge has yet to set a trial date. If convicted of kidnapping and murder, Dube would face between 25 years and life in prison, Bangor Daily News reported. If acquitted by reason of insanity, . Dube would be committed to a psychiatric institution until he is deemed . not to be a risk to society. Dube is accused of creating a phony . Facebook account and using it to set up a meeting with Nichole Cable, of . Glenburn, before killing her and hiding her body on May 12. Awaiting his fate: Dube could face 25 years to life if convicted of the charges, or he could be sent to a psychiatric institution if acquitted by reason of insanity . Police say Dube told others that he'd . intended to abduct Nichole and later come to her rescue. Her remains . were found in nearby Old Town eight days after she disappeared. Nichole was reported missing May 13 . by her mother, who said she had left the night before to meet a friend . at the end of their road but hadn't returned. Dube told others that he bound . Nichole and put her in the back of his father's pickup truck and that he . later discovered she was dead, authorities said. An autopsy determined she died from asphyxiation.

Mr Dube was indicted in late May on . charges of murder and kidnapping in the death of 15-year-old Nichole . Cable, whose body was found in a wooded area of Old Town this month a . week after she went missing. In . an affidavit released after Dube was indicted, Detective Thomas . Pickering outlined the scenario leading to the high school sophomore's . death. He wrote that . Dube told his brother that he used Facebook to trick her into going out . of her house in Glenburn, not far from Old Town, while he waited in the . woods wearing a ski mask. When Nichole came along, the . 20-year-old Dube jumped out and snatched her, duct-taped her and put her . in the back of his father's pickup truck, the affidavit said. Dube . later discovered that she was dead, so he dumped her body and covered it . with branches, it said. The affidavit doesn't go into details . about how Nichole was duct-taped, and the cause of her death is still . being determined by the medical examiner's office. Dube told his brother that he 'intended to kidnap Nichole and hide her; that he would later find her . and be the hero,' Pickering wrote. Dube's attorney, Stephen Smith, had argued for the affidavit to be withheld, citing threats . against Dube in jail, concerns about whether he could get a fair trial . and fears for the privacy of his relatives. Nichole was reported missing on May 13 . by her mother, who said she had left the night before to meet a friend . at the end of the driveway but hadn't returned. Heartbroken: Nichole's mother released a heart-breaking plea to her captor for her safe return . Police interviewed a friend of . Nichole's named Bryan Butterfield, who said somebody had set up a fake . Facebook account in his name and he suspected Dube. Butterfield told . detectives that Dube wanted to have sex with Nichole but that she had . rejected his advances, the affidavit said. Investigators determined that Nichole . had frequent contact with the fake Butterfield on Facebook and that the . person posing as Butterfield repeatedly requested to meet with her . before she agreed to meet with him at the end of her road to get some . marijuana the night she went missing, the affidavit said.

Eden Wormer, an eighth grade student at Cascade Middle School in Vancouver, Washington, committed suicide on Wednesday after her efforts at trying to fit in failed. Her older sister Audri said Eden changed her appearance several times, dying her hair, tanning and getting contact lenses, to get the girls to stop harassing her. Scroll down for video . Tormented: Eden Wormer, whose Facebook cover image included the haunting works, 'Right Now The Only Love Of My Life Is Me Myself And I,' took her own life after enduring two years of bullying . But the teen begged her sister not to tell anybody about what she was suffering at the hands of the group of eighth grade girls because she was afraid it would get worse. The bullying allegedly began when Eden was in the sixth grade, becoming more intense last year, and eventually tipping her over the edge. ‘Halfway through the seventh grade was when it started to get really bad,’ Audri told KATU News. ‘The bullying just kept getting . worse, and I kept telling her I’m going to do something, I’m going to do . something, and I should have done something.

A Lebanese woman who claims she was inappropriately groped by a Duane Reade pharmacist during a phony breast exam is suing the drug store chain for $40million. The lawsuit filed by Hayat Ammouri alleges that Monesh Hanoman 'sadistically and perversely' pinched and rubbed her breasts for nearly five minutes at a branch on Lexington Avenue, New York City. According to the papers filed with Manhattan Supreme Court, she was left 'traumatised [and] humiliated' by her alleged treatment at the hands of the pharmacist. Lawsuit: Hayat Ammouri, fashion editor of Beirut-based Laha Magazine, is seeking $40million in damages from drug store chain Duane Reade over claims an employee 'sadistically and perversely' fondled her breasts . Mr Hanoman, of Sunset Park, Brooklyn, has subsequently been sacked from his job with Duane Reade and, after the alleged assault was reported to police, prosecutors are reportedly considering charges against him. Ms Ammouri, a fashion editor in her native Lebanon who was on a visit to the U.S., went to the midtown store to buy over-the-counter medication on April 22, says the lawsuit seen by the New York Daily News. It is claimed that as she collected the drugs Mr Hanoman, 26, recommended a blood pressure test and took her to an enclosed partition and told her to remove her outer clothing. That test came back normal, but Mr Hanoman then allegedly also offered Ms Ammouri a manual mammogram, to which the devout Muslim unwittingly agreed. The pharmacist is then said to have pulled down her T-shirt 'and pushed each cup of her bra to the side so that her breasts were fully exposed'. Ms Ammouri stood with her arms raised above her head as Mr Hanoman fondled her breasts and asked her whether she had ever given birth or breastfed a child, the complaint alleges. It says the exam continued for an unreasonably long time, which should have raised alarm among other employees the Duane Reade branch. After Mr Hanoman told the embarrassed editor it's 'all good' she returned to her room at the Waldorf Astoria hotel. It was only after she told her cousin the next day about the exam that she realised something was amiss, when he told her 'that such an exam was not normal', the lawsuit said. The Duane Reade branch at 773 Lexington Ave, where the harassment is alleged to have occurred: A spokesman for the company confirmed that it had sacked the employee concerned . Duane Reade spokesman Calvin Peters told the New York Daily News that the chain took prompt action after learning of the incident and had sacked Mr Hanoman. 'We truly regret that this occurred,' Mr Peters added. Ms Ammouri has since returned to her home city of Beirut, where she works for Laha Magazine. Her U.S. lawyer Joseph Tacopina says that New York prosecutors have been in touch with her. The lawsuit says Ms Ammouri has been left emotionally scarred. 'Ms Ammouri has been incredibly traumatised, humiliated and now suffers from severe emotional distress and other related psychological injuries,' it said.",Hayat Ammouri claims she was 'sadistically and perversely' fondled by an employee who claimed he was giving her a breast exam .

A woman who wanted to make a family trip to show her family the grave of her late military hero husband, got a terrible shock. Instead of her own name, on the reverse side of her husband’s headstone is a strange woman’s name. Edna Fielden took her grandchildren from their home in Minnesota to the Ft. Logan military cemetery where her late husband Air Force Sergeant Billy Fielden is buried in Denver, Colorado. Fielden was buried there 25 years ago after dying of cardiac arrest at age 58. Edna had hoped for the trip to be a special one, but it quickly turned nightmarish. Betrayal? Edna Fielden hadn't visited her beloved late husband's grave in several years. But when she did, she was shocked to find another woman's name engraved on it . ‘A piece of my heart broke off,’ Fielden told WKYC. Who was this Dolores, whose name was etched on her husband’s grave marker? ‘I gasped and said who is this,’ Fielden said, choking up. ‘I thought this woman was in this grave with him as I want to be.’ Fearing the worst for an entire weekend, Fielden waited for the cemetery office to open that Monday. Mysterious: Air Force Sergeant Billy Fielden was a devoted husband and father, said Edna, and he died 25 years ago. So why did his tombstone have some other woman's name now? 'I gasped and said who is this?': Edna Fielden wanted the trip she took with her family from Minnesota, to see her late husband's grave in Denver, to be special but it turned nightmarish . That’s when cemetery director Joe Turnbach informed her that she needn’t have worried. Dolores is not burred with Edna’s husband. But a mistake was obviously made. ‘I do want to apologize to the family and somehow we want to make this right,’ Turnbach said. Turnbach believes a headstone engraver mistakenly engraved two markers for Dolores some ten years ago but never divulged his flub to the cemetery administration. He believe Dolores is buried elsewhere, with her husband, in the cemetery. Sorry: After a weekend of waiting, apologetic cemetery director Joe Turnbach revealed to Edna the engraving was just a mistake made years ago but never uncovered.

Former Pakistani military ruler Pervez Musharraf is on the run after fleeing a court in the country's capital to avoid arrest after his bail was revoked, police said. Officers were deployed at the court building in Islamabad but Musharraf's security team rushed him out and put him in a black pick-up truck before they could detain him. The court rejected his bail in a case related to his decision to suspend the constitution and declare a state of emergency in 2007, police spokesman Ali Asghar said. Scroll down for video . Pakistan's former President Pervez Musharraf was rushed out of the courthouse in Islamabad and into a waiting SUV this morning . The former President fled at such a speed, one of his security detail was left clinging to the outside off the car as it sped off . A spokeswoman for Musharraf, Saima Ali Dada, said his legal team is trying to decide the next move. Formerly one of Pakistan's most powerful politicians after seizing power in a 1999 coup, Pervez Musharraf went from Pakistan President to self-imposed exile. During his tenure in charge of the country, which ended in 2008, he survived numerous attempts on his life. The turning point of his time in charge came after the 9/11 terror attack in 2001. He supported America's 'War on Terror', which proved hugely unpopular in Pakistan. In a bid to crush militants who supported Al Qaeda, he ordered his security forces to lay siege to the Red Mosque and its Islamic school in Islamabad, which was said to be campaigning to enforce Sharia law. More than 100 people were killed. In the aftermath, Islamist militants began a campaign of suicide bombings and Musharraf fled the country in 2008, returning last month to participate in elections. His time in power was also marked by . struggles with the judiciary, including an attempt to remove the chief . justice in 2007 - for which he faces treason charges - and clashes over his bid to remain . head of the army while still president. He attempted to appease the West by aiding the 'War on Terror' but managed to further anger militants within Pakistan... while the West criticised his dedication to fighting Al Qaeda. Musharraf was also accused of not doing enough to protect . former PM Benazir Bhutto from being assassinated in 2007, despite . allegedly being aware of Taliban plans to kill her. It followed accusations that he was indirectly responsible for the death of Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti, a Baloch nationalist leader killed in an army operation the year before. Local television broadcast footage of Musharraf jumping into a black SUV and escaping as a member of his security team clung to the outside of the vehicle.  Meanwhile lawyers shouted 'Look who is running, Musharraf is running!' He sped away to his large compound on the outskirts of Islamabad that is protected by high walls, razor wire and guard towers. This week has gone from bad to worse for Musharraf, who seized power in a coup in 1999 when he was serving as army chief and spent nearly a decade in power before being forced to step down in 2008. He returned last month after four years in self-imposed exile in Britain to make a political comeback despite legal challenges and Taliban death threats, but has since faced paltry public support. A court in the northwestern city of Peshawar on Tuesday disqualified Musharraf from running in the parliamentary election scheduled for May 11, likely squashing his hopes for political comeback. The case before the Islamabad High . Court  today involved Musharraf's decision in 2007 to detain senior . judges, including the chief justice of the Supreme Court, when he . declared a state of emergency and suspended the constitution. The . decision outraged many Pakistanis, and further fueled a nationwide . protest movement by lawyers that eventually resulted in Musharraf . stepping down under the threat of impeachment. Before he returned to the country, . Musharraf obtained pre-arrest bail for the judges' case and two others, . meaning he could not be arrested when he landed - a feature of . Pakistan's legal system. The Islamabad High Court refused to extend that bail today and ordered his arrest, said police officer Ali Asghar. The court previously agreed to extend . his bail in the case for six days on April 12. It's unclear why they . chose to reject it this time. Despite crowds of people, including police officers with the power to arrest him, Musharraf managed to escape to his compound . After Musharraf got away, Pakistani paramilitary soldiers were seen leaving the Islamabad High Court today . Musharraf's lawyer, Ahmad Raza Kasuri, . complained that the court didn't listen to their arguments, saying: 'It . is a one-sided decision' that he would challenge. - Ali Dayan Hasan, Human Rights Watch Pakistan . Musharraf's decision to flee the court could put the Pakistani army in an awkward situation. The former general is protected by paramilitary soldiers who officially report to the Interior Ministry, but are headed by senior army officers. Ali Dayan Hasan, the director of Human Rights Watch in Pakistan, called on the military authorities protecting Musharraf to comply with the court's order and ensure that he presents himself for arrest. 'General Musharraf's act today underscores his disregard for due legal process and indicates his assumption that as a former army chief and military dictator he can evade accountability for abuses,' said Hasan in a statement sent to reporters. Musharraf fled to his heavily-guarded compound on the edge of the city after evading arrest today . 'Continued military protection for General Musharraf will make a mockery of claims that Pakistan's armed forces support the rule of law and bring the military further disrepute that it can ill afford,' Hasan said. Pakistan has a long history of the army seizing power in military coups, and the service is considered the most powerful institution in the country. If convicted of treason, Musharraf could face the death penalty or life in prison. But the federal government would have to file charges against the former military ruler, which it has not yet done. The petitions in Islamabad High Court accusing Musharraf of treason were all filed by individuals. Musharraf faces similar accusations from petitions filed before the Supreme Court. He also faces legal charges in two other cases.","Pervez Musharraf, 69, was in court in Islamabad accused of treason .

An underage teenage prostitute who slept with football star Frank Ribery . ‘was not a vulnerable person’, the player’s lawyer claimed today. Carlo-Alberto Bruso was speaking on the first day of a criminal trial . which could see Ribery and his France international teammate Karim . Benzema jailed. Both are accused of having slept with Zahia Dehar, a French-Algerian . call girl, between 2008 and 2009, when she was between 16 and 17 years . old. Accused: Franck Ribery, right, and Karim Benzema, left, were today facing jail for allegedly paying for sex with an underage prostitute . Trial: Both footballers are accused of having slept with Zahia Dehar, a French-Algerian call girl, between 2008 and 2009, when she was between 16 and 17 years old . At the opening of the men’s trial at Paris Correctional Court, Mr Bruso . said that Ribery had ‘no idea’ that Dehar was underage during their . relationship. ‘There was nothing about her which suggested a vulnerable person,’ said . Mr Bruso. ‘She is a woman who is always made-up, with her hair done and . well dressed.’ Mr Bruso questioned the law on underage sex, saying that it was too ‘imprecise’  to prosecute the players. The age of consent in France is 15, and prostitution is legal, but only if both parties are over the age of 18. In the dock: Ribery, 30, is accused of flying Dehar, pictured, from Paris to Munich 'as a birthday present to himself' If found guilty, Ribery and 25-year-old Benzema, who plays for Real . Madrid, face a maximum jail sentence of three years and fines equivalent . to around £40,000. Benzema denies having any sexual relationship with Dehar whatsoever, despite her telling police the opposite in 2010. She was interviewed by detectives investigating a vice ring at the Zaman . Cafe, on the Champs Elysee, which has since been shut down. Top footballers, including many playing for David Beckham’s old club . Paris St Germain, were said to have used the club to pick up . prostitutes. Nine men have so far been charged with offences related to the enquiry, including Ribery’s brother-in-law. Neither Ribery, Benzema nor prosecution witness Dehar appeared at . today’s hearing, which heard that Dehar had been a prostitute since the . age of 15, but always told clients she was 18. Court documents reveal that she attended Ribery’s 26th birthday party in . a hotel in 2009, and afterwards he paid her the equivalent of £600 for sex, despite being a devout Muslim who is married. Benzema is suspected of having paid the equivalent of some £400 for sex with Dehar in a Paris hotel suite in May 2008. Dehar’s lawyer, Daniel Vaconsin, said she would only turn up in court if . asked. She is now a celebrity in France, having appeared on numerous . reality TV shows and started her own lingerie range. The trial was today adjourned until January next year to enable the law on underage prostitution to be reviewed.

A man who became obsessed with 1960s fantasy sitcom I Dream Of Jeannie when he was just four years old has finally met the show's star, 46 years later. Greg Cochrane, 50, from Sarasota, Florida, is such a fan of the show, he has several mannequins dressed as Jeannie, played by Barbara Eden, and takes them around with him. Now, ,decades after he first watched Ms Eden on the small screen of his childhood home, Mr Cochrane has flown to Kansas City to meet his idol. And of course, he took his favourite mannequin with him. Scroll down for video . Greg Cochrane took his plastic replica Jeannie to meet the show's star, Barbara Eden, and even bought it its own plane seat . In a trip filmed by TLC for their show My Crazy Obsession, Mr Cochrane packed up his life-size mannequin of Jeannie and headed off to Missouri. The footage shows him sitting next to his doll on the plane - he bought it a seat to avoid it being checked in like luggage, and then taking it to the theatre where Ms Eden was starring in a play. The actress invited Mr Cochrane, who spent $1,000 on the trip, up on to stage and he told her breathlessly: 'I've waited 46 years to meet you.' Ms Eden was so overcome with the excitement of it she tripped over, but after picking herself up she said: 'Well, I'm so happy that you did.' Mr Cochrane, who has long collected classic Hollywood memorabilia, said: 'I've just met Barbara in person - it is no longer a fantasy for me. 'It'll always be a part of my memory.' Mr Cochrane began watching the cult 1960s show when he was just four - now 50, he has finally met the show's star . As Mr Cochrane was introduced to Barbara Eden, he whispered: 'I've waited 46 years to meet you' Greg Cochrane was happy to buy his Jeannie replica her own plane seat to avoid having the doll thrown in the hold . In the show which was broadcast last night, Mr Cochrane added: 'After all these years of collecting, it's finally paid off.' Mr Cochrane has collected all kinds of Hollywood memorabilia since he was a child, but Ms Eden's iconic character, and the show she starred in, held a special significance for him,and he admits having watched it over and over again. He has several life-size Jeannie mannequins, as well as board games, videos, dolls and one of the original genie bottles used in the show. In the original TV show, Barbara Eden wore exactly the same revealing costume as that worn by Mr Cochrane's doll . Barbara Eden, who is now 78, seemed delighted to meet her most ardent fan, and quickly regained composure after tripping over . Mr Cochrane's Jeannie mannequin underwent some checks at the airport, just like everyone else . I Dream Of Jeannie, created by legendary writer Sidney Sheldon, starred Larry Hagman along with Ms Eden and began a five-season run in September 1965. Ms Eden starred as a 2,000-year-old genie who eventually falls in love with her master, Major Nelson, played by Mr Hagman. In most of the shows, the Jeannie character wore a revealing costume but was forbidden from showing her navel.  Censors agreed that it was OK that she - an unmarried woman - lived in the same house as another man because she slept in her bottle. Mr Cochrane has an all-encompassing selection of memorabilia related to the 1960s show, including a board game, above . Is Greg Cochrane I Dream Of Jeannie's biggest fan?

Obama's comments today in Berlin about 'breaking down the walls' come tinged with irony as the President delivered his remarks behind thick walls of bullet-proof glass.

The last time that Obama spoke to 200,000 people in Berlin, there was no safety glass  - but then, he was not yet president. It was put up at his victory speech in November 2008, when Obama and family waved to supporters behind the two-inch thick walls. Since then, it has been in constant use. The reported $100million cost of Obama's trip to Africa this month includes three trucks with sheets of bullet­proof glass - some of which will be used to cover hotel windows. He challenged Americans and Europeans not to become complacent even though the Cold War is over.

She has spent the past year cooped up in a council house - about as far from the proverbial happy pig in muck as it is possible to be. But now Babe, the sow who was discovered living in the small end-terrace home by stunned officials when they tried to evict her owner, has had her bacon saved. The Daily Mail has tracked her down to an animal rescue centre where caring workers say she is timid, and scared of human contact - but on the road to recovery. Incredibly, her owner, Sean Varty, turned up with the unusual pet in the back of his car shortly after being ordered to leave his council house, and asked staff to look after her. They are now seeking to pair Babe, named after the pig in the hit film, with a mate before rehoming the couple. Lindsay Newell, a veterinary nurse who runs the Burton Wildlife Centre in Etwall, Derbys, said today: 'She doesn't like being grabbed or picked up. If anyone tries to approach her she runs away. 'She's in a stable on her own at the moment because she initially didn't like to be around other pigs, either. But she's coming out of her shell a bit now and wanted to mix with the other pigs we have here. We're taking it one day at a time.' It is believed Mr Varty thought he was buying a micropig when he purchased Babe as a piglet around a year ago. But Miss Newell said she was actually a Kunekune, a breed that, although one of the smallest in the world, can grow to two feet tall and weigh 15 stone. Babe, who now weighs around four stone, was discovered last week when council housing staff forced their way into Mr Varty's home in Sinfin, Derby. For several weeks, they had been receiving reports of a strong smell coming from the property. Even experienced workers were shocked by what they found - Babe had the run of the entire downstairs of the property, including the kitchen and bathroom, where it is believed she slept. The floor was covered in a thick carpet of her mess, and mud. Cared for: Veterinary nurse Lindsay Newall pictured with the pig rescued from a council house in Derby . On the road to recovery: Babe is still shy, but is slowly coming out of her shell . When Mr Varty returned home, he simply put her into the back of his Renault Megane in front of the stunned council employees, and drove away. He is now thought to be staying with friends, while the council has been left with a £15,000 clean-up bill for the wrecked house. A spokesman for Derby Homes, which looks after Derby City Council's housing stock, said they would be pursuing the 44-year-old for the cost of the operation. Miss Newell, 25, said: 'A house is certainly not a suitable environment to keep a pig. In fact, I was disgusted when I heard how she had been living. 'They are quite clean creatures, and it would not have been good for her to be living in that mess. I was shocked. They're also social animals, and she wouldn't have liked living alone. 'Her owner called and asked if we took in pigs. He says he doesn't want her back. We'll try to pair her up with a mate and then look to rehome them in a month or so.' New lease of life: Babe is a lot cleaner than when rescuers found her in the council house . This little piggy stayed at home: This is the sight that greeted housing officials after they turned up to evict a tenant and found he had been using his council home as a pigsty . Emma Fahy, 41, also volunteers at the centre. She said: 'She's a bit scared and quite timid. She basically does not know how to be a pig. 'She's okay physically, but it's one step at a time right now. She simply should just not have been kept in a house as a pet.' Miss Newell said the rescue centre was seeing an increasing number of people bringing in large pigs that they thought would remain tiny for life. She added: 'Mr Varty said he thought he'd bought a micropig. We have had eight come in to the centre in the last six months or so. I think people have an unrealistic expectation of what they are buying. 'They see them on TV and with celebrities, sitting in their handbags, and think they remain tiny. But they get much bigger, and then the owners can't cope. I don't understand why people buy them.' Neighbours think the pig had been kept in the house for more than a year and it is estimated that repairs to the damage of the home will be in the region of £10,000 to £15,000 . Piles of junk was found in one of the bedrooms, left, while mud and muck covered the stairs, hallway and door . The front room with a dirty red leather sofa, faeces and piles of household junk stacked up on shelves . Fancy a bath? Derby Homes, which manages council housing in the city, said the tenant was an 'excessive hoarder' and that some rooms were so full of junk that they could not get in at all . The garden isn't much better full of old bits of wood, a barbecue. At one point there were two ponies in the garden .

Taxpayers will have to pay a massive £2 billion to thousands of part-time judges after Ministers lost a seven-year court battle to stop them claiming the right to a pension. More than 8,000 sitting and thousands more retired part-time judges will be entitled to a public-sector pension for the first time after the decision by Supreme Court judges. Among the beneficiaries will be Cherie Booth QC and millionaire Tory MP Stephen Phillips QC. But none of the lawyers, many of whom have earned millions of pounds in legal aid, will have to contribute to their ‘free’ pension – meaning the Treasury must find extra cash to settle the bill while at the same time cutting pay and pensions across the rest of the public sector. MPs, public-sector workers and taxpayer groups last night condemned the decision. Liberal Democrat MP John Hemming described the pensions payments as paying ‘silly’ money to lawyers, adding: ‘It strikes me that there is a conflict of interest if judges are sitting in judgment about the amount of money in their own pensions.’ Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance pressure group, said: ‘This judgment will cost taxpayers a huge amount of money at a time when they can least  afford it.’ Harry Fletcher, assistant general secretary of the probation union Napo, added: ‘Everyone else who draws a pension has paid into the relevant pot and the same should apply to part-time judges. ‘It’s clearly not fair if someone can draw a pension when they’ve not contributed to it.’ Until now part-time judges, who are paid up to £800 a day, were excluded from the Government’s generous pension deals reserved for full-time members of the judiciary. A typical final-salary pension for a part-time judge who has served 25 years will be worth about £125,000 – or £5,000 a year over 25 years. But some fee-paid judges who sit  almost all year long could be entitled to pensions valued at more than £1 million. Hundreds of part-time judges who have retired have launched legal action against the Government to get back-dated pensions. The . Government said it was justified in excluding part-time and fee-paid . judges on the basis of fairness and cost, but the Supreme Court judges . rejected that argument. Most . part-time judges are wealthy barristers and solicitors who have made . millions out of the legal aid system, have had successful careers at the . Bar and already have their own separate private pensions. Lib Dem MP John Hemming, left, described the pensions payments as 'silly'. Tory MP Stephen Phillips QC, right, will be among the beneficiaries . The decision to award them additional retirement payouts comes after a seven-year legal battle by a leading QC, Dermot O’Brien, who claimed the judicial pension scheme for salaried full-time judges discriminated against those who worked part-time. Mr O’Brien, 73, retired as a part-time Recorder in 2005. The barrister earned hundreds of thousands of pounds during his 27 years of judicial service, but argued that under European law it was unfair to deny him an additional pension. The Ministry of Justice said: ‘The recent court judgment in the O’Brien case on the employment status of fee-paid judges is complex and its implications need to be considered in full. It remains subject to further legal proceedings so the final outcomes and costs remain highly uncertain.’ It added: ‘The department has estimated that in the worst-case scenario the maximum possible exposure to the Judicial Pension Scheme could be up to £2 billion. There is no immediate cost to the taxpayer, and any future liabilities would be met over a period of several years.’ Paul Epstein QC, of barristers’ chambers Cloisters, which represented Mr O’Brien, said: ‘Mr O’Brien illustrates the importance for both public and private sector employers of ensuring that pay differentials are not discriminatory. ‘The Government had argued that for a number of different reasons the differentials in pay between part-time and full-time judges were objectively justified. ‘The court decided in the end that all those reasons came down to cost, and that cost can never objectively justify discrimination.’ He told The Mail on Sunday: ‘So although in the current financial crisis there is often a limited budget available to employers, and it is up to employers to decide how much of that budget to use to pay employees, employers cannot discriminate between employees when fixing pay from that budget.’ Many people think judges are out of touch. This astonishing pension grab proves they are greedy as well. For an already highly affluent clique to insist on their legal entitlement to as much as £2 billion in extra pension perks – money which does not exist, and will have to be taken from future taxation – is an insult to the public they are supposed to serve. Britain is already convulsed by the financial consequences of having promised too much in pensions to too many civil servants. Not only has the cost become unsupportable, especially for an economy that is not growing, but the issue sparks division and resentment. There are the public-sector workers on the one hand with enviable, inflation-proofed pensions underwritten by the Treasury, and then there is everyone else battling to save for retirement when interest rates are the lowest in history. Judges sit in splendour at the very top of the pensions pile. Their entitlements are lavish beyond the dreams of the average saver. And the cost to the taxpayer is eye-watering. Currently, judges need to work for just 20 years to retire on the equivalent of half their final salary, which they can collect along with a handsome one-off sum. For a High Court judge, that could mean retiring on about £90,000 plus a £200,000 cash payment. Compare that to an average 65-year-old man wanting to buy an inflation-linked pension today from an insurance company. To obtain similar benefits to those enjoyed by the judge, he would have had to amass £2 million in his pension fund. If he were self-employed or a private sector worker, he would have had to contribute most of that himself. The Government is rightly seeking to cut back judges’ pensions along with those of other public-sector workers. But the profession has so far proved highly resistant. This case, involving part-timers, suggests judges are hell-bent on taking everything to which they and their legal allies in the courts can argue that they are entitled to. The financial crisis has thrown up many cases where bankers and others have tried to prove legal entitlements to vast pensions and payoffs, but where shareholders and the public have furiously disagreed. A court may approve these payments to judges – but that does not make them right.","More than 8,000 sitting and thousands .

Most running races require a degree of speed, but even those who trailed in last in this fun-run found they took longer tying up their shoelaces than they did completing the course. Every single one of the 390 athletes who entered the World's Shortest Fun Run in Burntwood, Staffordshire, got to the finishing line - with the fastest taking just seven seconds to complete the course. Now organisers say they hope they have set a new Guinness world record with their 55-yard long race. Pace yourselves: Nearly 400 people entered the 55-yard race around the tiny Prince's Park in Burntwood, Staffordshire . A minature Darth Vader, a couple of Elvises - the miniature fun run resembled a marathon in everything but size . Prince's Park measures just 15ft by 30ft - barely the size of a traffic island - but is officially the UK's smallest park . The course involved a loop of what is officially the smallest park in Britain: the diminutive Prince's Park in Burntwood, Staffordshire. Everyone in the field, ranging in age from three months to 93, successfully completed the triangular course, and they managed to raise more than £750 for local charities as they did so. The 150-year-old park sits at the centre of a road intersection, and despite its size, boasts a wrought-iron perimeter fence, three trees and a memorial bench. Kevin Wilson, of sports organisers KP Events, said Bank Holiday Monday’s race had been a big success. He said: 'We had a good turnout and they all got going around the park - which is just 55 steps in total. 'Everyone got dressed up and treated it like a normal race.  We're now waiting to hear from Guinness that they have recognised it as the world record.' Hundreds turned out to watch the runners in what organisers hope will be crowned the shortest fun run in the world . Keep going! The youngest participant was three months and the oldest 93 years at Monday's run in Burntwood . Competitor Sharon Grey, 21, from Lichfield, said: 'It was nice to see the community get together around the park.  We don’t notice it’s there any more but it was nice to be reminded we’ve got such a unique landmark on our doorsteps.' The park was created to commemorate the marriage of Albert Edward, Prince of Wales and Princess Alexandra of Denmark in 1863, and the three trees are named Faith, Hope and Charity. All proceeds from the race were donated to the We Love Lichfield charity, which has raised more than £150,000 for local voluntary groups.","Nearly 400 did the 55-yard dash around Prince's Park in Burntwood, Staffs .

This is the teenage air hostess who was killed when an illegal immigrant ploughed into her car on a motorway before giving false details to police and going on the run. Charlotte Smoker, 19, died after Pakistani-born Zahid Masood, 47, drove into her stationary car on the M25 while making a mobile telephone call in November 2003. Today Zahid Masood, 47, was sentenced to four years in prison after being found guilty of causing Miss Smoker's death by dangerous driving. Charlotte Smoker, 19, left, died after illegal immigrant Zahid Masood, 47, right, drove into her car on the M25 . Miss Smoker's mother Michelle sobbed in court as she watched the man who killed her daughter jailed, before saying: 'The pain never goes and never will go, we just get better at bearing it.' Masood, who had no insurance, had ploughed into Miss Smoker’s Fiat Cinquecento car close to junction four of the M25 near Shoreham in Kent. Miss Smoker, who worked for Ryanair and was engaged to her boyfriend, had dialled 999 and the hazard lights were flashing on her car when Masood, who was driving a company car in the outside lane, smashed into her. Masood, who only had a provisional driving licence and should not have been driving on the motorway, was living in the UK under a false name at the time, which he gave to police before fleeing Britain for Pakistan soon after the accident in November 2003. He later moved back to the UK, and was living with his family in Lower Stoke near Rochester, in Kent, under his real name when his cover was blown. The court heard that Masood was a Pakistani national but had been living in the UK with his Romanian girlfriend Marinela using the identity of South African-born 'Ahmed Mukhtar'. Last November, nine years after the . crash, Masood was arrested after British police discovered first his . real name and secondly the fact that he was living back in the UK. Masood was sentenced to four years and nine months in prison at Maidstone Crown Court today while Miss Smoker's family looked on . After failing to track down 'Ahmed Mukhtar', UK police tried to track him down via his Romanian girlfriend.  Police in Romania told them she had married a man named Zahid Masood in Romania in 2004, and when they saw the wedding pictures, officers realised he was the man they were after. They then discovered that Masood and Marinela were back in England, living with their two young children near Rochester in Kent, and he was a parent governor at Hundred of Hoo Primary School. This week in court Masood admitted perverting the course of justice by giving a false name and leaving the UK, but he had denied causing death by dangerous driving. Miss Smoker, from Bishops Stortford, Hertfordshire, was driving on the M25 from Guildford in Surrey to Stansted airport. The court heard that witnesses saw her sitting in her car apparently making a telephone call, presumably to get help, shortly before Masood drove into her.  It was not clear why she had stopped, although evidence was given that one of her rear tyres was deflated. 'The pain never goes and never will go, we just get better at bearing it' - Michele Smoker, Charlotte's mother . Prosecutor Allister Walker said a lorry driver had described Masood's Ford Focus, in which was also Marinela, passing him at an estimated 80-90mph, heading straight for Miss Smoker's Fiat. He said: 'He saw the collision. The car braked but it was far too late. It collided with the rear of the Fiat and pushed it into the central barrier.' The court heard Masood was working for Universal Workforce in Belvedere, which provides staff for food factories, and did not have permission to drive the company’s car. He denied using his mobile, claiming his partner was on the phone to someone in Romania, but investigators showed calls had been made to a food company he dealt with in his work. Masood, who speaks only basic English, told police: 'It was an unfortunate accident. I still can’t believe and can’t know how it happened. 'I saw the vehicle but there were no hazard lights. I didn’t realise it was stopped, it was too late for me to much brake.' He said he left the UK because he was afraid he would be jailed and deported, and went to Romania with his partner where they married three months after the crash. The couple, who now have two children aged seven and two, returned to the UK for good in 2007. Asked by police why he had not handed himself into them before, Masood replied: 'Now I have small kids and imagine being far from them. I was very frightened. I was in too much distress and in too much fear of going to prison and being apart from my children. 'I can never forget this, it changed my life upside down. I couldn’t sleep at night, it would all come back every time I tried to sleep. 'Now I am feeling relieved to be facing this once and for all and to get my punishment. I didn’t come forward, that was my mistake and I very regret this.' As Miss Smoker's family looked on, Judge Philip Statman sentenced Masood to four years’ jail for causing death by dangerous driving and nine months consecutively for peverting justice. He told him: 'It may well have been the situation that but for the distraction because your mind was on business rather than on the road this dreadful collision with all its consequences may well have been avoided. 'Charlotte was a daughter who made us immensely proud parents.  Masood was in this country illegally and had no compunction in his total disregard of the law and standards of Britain' - Ian Smoker, Charlotte's father . 'You will appreciate the devastating consequences of your actions on this particular day.' Afterwards Miss Smoker's father Ian, 52, Michele, 51, sister Hannah, 23, brother Timothy, 27, and grandfather Peter Storah, 88, thanked Kent Police for their 'hard work and tenacity' in bringing Masood to justice. Mr Smoker, a retired RAF officer, said: 'Charlotte was a daughter who made us immensely proud parents. She was guardian to her younger siblings in the UK whilst we were in Cyprus on a military posting. She was sensible beyond her 19 years. 'Zahid Masood was in this country illegally and had no compunction in his total disregard of the law and standards of Britain.' 'He was able very easily to leave the country by altering his identity and then to return as another person to build a new life after having destroyed ours. 'Every single day when you are out you are thinking ‘who has done this’ - it’s just been very hard.'","Zahid Masood, 47, killed Charlotte Smoker, 19, after crashing into her car .

To see his brave smile, you would . hardly believe that it is only six weeks since two-year-old Keiron Guess . nearly lost his life when a neighbour’s crazed dog ripped his face to . shreds. The toddler was . given a 50/50 chance of surviving the savaging by the pet, thought to be . a Staffordshire bull terrier or similar. Although . the dog was destroyed, its owner cannot be prosecuted because the . attack took place in a private garden, rather than on a public street. Yesterday, . Keiron’s parents called for action to close this ‘loophole’ in the . Dangerous Dogs Act. Unlike in Scotland or Northern Ireland, the law in . England allows ‘devil dog’ owners to escape prosecution in cases such as . this. The dog, named Ratty, . belonged to 15-year-old Shovell King and his unemployed father Garfield . King, of Swindon. And far from showing any shame or remorse for the . attack, Shovell later took to Facebook to declare: ‘I couldn’t give a . toss.’ His father blamed the . boy’s parents for not keeping a closer eye on him, insisting: ‘If . you’re a parent you have to look after your children 24 hours a day. If . it wasn’t a dog it could have been a paedophile.’ Last . year, during a drugs raid at the house, the dog had attacked two police . officers and not even a blast from a Taser stun gun could subdue it. Yesterday, . Keiron’s mother, Stacey Drury, 22, said: ‘You don’t see a child looking . like Keiron, because they don’t normally survive an attack like that. 'Doctors gave Keiron just a 50/50 chance of survival. It’s nothing short of a miracle that he is here at all.’ Before the attack: The toddler needed seven hours of surgery to rebuild his face after being attacked by Shovell and Garfield King's Staffordshire bull terrier Ratty outside his home in Swindon . Keiron . spent a week in a coma, and even when he came round it was several days . until the family realised the sight in one of his eyes had been saved. 'Like father, like son': Garfield King, whose 15-year-old son Shovell said he 'couldn't give a toss' that his dog had savaged little Kieron . His . father Anthony Guess, 25, said: ‘We weren’t sure how much he would be . able to see out of his eye until my dad visited and he shouted out, . “Grampie!”’ Keiron is now . out of hospital, but his mother says: ‘He used to be happy and smiley . all the time. Now he does have bursts of anger. And he has terrible . nightmares and he’ll wake up dripping with sweat and screaming and . thrashing about. ‘He saw a dog in the street the other day and he was petrified and said, “Dog bite, dog bite!”.’ The . couple told of the moment when doctors gave them just ten seconds to . kiss their mauled son goodbye before taking him for immediate surgery, . warning that it could be their last chance to see him alive. Miss . Drury said: ‘I couldn’t kiss his face – it wasn’t there any more. So I . kissed his stomach and told him, “Mummy loves you”.’ It . is only thanks to the expertise of surgeons who performed a ten-hour . operation that Keiron, who had to have most of his face reconstructed, . survived. The attack . happened on the Jubilee Bank Holiday weekend early last month, as the . couple were at their home with Keiron and their other son, four-year-old . Mackenzie. Keiron’s . grandfather, Dave Guess, 49, had been helping to renovate the family’s . bathroom and walked out to his van when the two boys followed. Their . mother, who is pregnant with the couple’s third child, said: ‘Seconds . later we came out. We could see Mackenzie –but not Keiron.’ They . began a frantic search and realised that the toddler had wandered into . the Kings’ back garden only when another neighbour yelled: ‘A dog’s got . him! A dog’s got him!’ Despite . being bitten himself, Mr Guess Snr managed to get Keiron away, and his . son said: ‘I saw Dad with Keiron cradled in his arms, but it didn’t look . like Keiron. 'All I could see was bubbles of red coming out of his face. His nose had gone. ‘His eye was ripped open. Basically his whole face had been ripped to shreds. ‘It was horrific – like something from a horror film. Not something you see in real life.’ Paramedics . arrived within minutes, followed by an on-call doctor, police cars and a . helicopter ambulance which landed in the nearby park. During the mayhem, Keiron’s ear, which had been found near the scene, was handed to paramedics in a handkerchief. Aggression: Two pit bull-style dogs seen leaping up at Shovell King's house near to where Keiron was attacked . Mr Guess Jnr recalled: ‘Stacey was on the floor crying. Some bloke was trying to comfort me because I was just in tears. ‘You’re . meant to protect your kids aren’t you? More than anything I was angry. 'I . kept thinking this shouldn’t have happened. Someone is to blame.’ Last . night Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman said: ‘Every dog owner . needs to be held responsible for what their animal does and we want to . change the law so that if your dog mauls someone on private property, . you will face prosecution, as happens if an attack takes place in . public.’ Scene: An alleyway behind Swanage Walk in Swindon, where the attack happened in June .

Victimised: Sadia Raza, 49, was harassed by her boss Graham Holland at a Christianity retreat centre . A former housekeeper from Asia has won £43,000 compensation after being asked 'is that how they run hotels in Pakistan?' as she felt harassed by her boss at a Christian retreat centre. The comment to Sadia Raza, 49, was made after general manager Graham Holland was unimpressed by the way she had made up a room. The single mother was chided and abused in front of colleagues for no reason at the Whirlow Grange Christianity Centre in Sheffield, a tribunal heard. On another occasion, Mr Holland picked up a cheesecake dessert in the staff canteen and said: 'If I drop this plate Sadia will lick it up off the floor.' Mr Holland, who is married with three children and a keen motorcyclist, also asked the Pakistan-born worker while in the kitchen: 'Do you fancy a ride?' Not realising this was a smutty double entendre, Mrs Raza replied: 'Oh yes, whereabouts?' Mr Holland then said: 'How would you like something red hot and throbbing through your legs.' Mr Holland also told Mrs Raza she should have a relationship with an Indian-born security guard at the centre saying: 'He wants to stay his visa has expired.' Once he reduced her to tears when he told her to 'f*** off' as she attempted to wipe clean spilled tea on a lunch table in front of him. And on another occasion he told a tradesman: 'Oh here she is. This is who gives free hugs to . people.' The tribunal ruled that Mrs Raza had been 'upset and humiliated' by Mr Holland's behaviour. Mrs Raza told the tribunal Mr Holland was 'aggressive and insulting' towards her as if he was 'speaking to an errant ten-year-old child.' She won her claim for unfair dismissal and victimisation and partly succeeded in a harassment claim following a three-day hearing in Sheffield. However, her claim of race and sex discrimination were rejected. Mr Holland and Mrs Raza's employers had denied all the allegations. The incidents all happened while she was working part-time for 16 hours a week at the residential conference and spirituality centre in Sheffield where the Archbishops of York and Canterbury have stayed in the past. After she got a second job as a care assistant at a Leonard Cheshire home to boost her income she was sacked after just a fortnight there because of a poor reference from Whirlow Grange management. She then took out employment tribunal proceedings against Whirlow in February 2012. Abuse: Mrs Raza, 49, was victimised and unfairly dismissed from Whirlow Grange, in Sheffield, the tribunal ruled . She was hauled before a disciplinary meeting and two months later sacked for gross misconduct - over allegations that she sexually harassed four men at the centre. Abuse: Married father-of-three Graham Holland who made crude remarks about his motorbike . Management claimed she pinched the bottoms of the male employees, cuddled and flirted with them, even suggested to one man that they go up to his flat. But none of these witnesses were produced at the Sheffield tribunal and Employment Judge Philip Rostant said 'the tribunal draws an inference that the allegations are not true in their substance or at any rate amount to gross exaggerations of the experience of these men with the claimant.' Whirlow Grange and Mr Holland, who lived in Chesterfield, claimed Mrs Raza 'conducted a number of acts of . gross misconduct' involving sexually harassing the head chef and bar . supervisor and was sacked after a 'reasonable' internal investigation. The tribunal ruled several other claims made by Mrs Raza were 'outlandish' and that she could be 'irritating' towards Mr Holland on occasions. But Mr Rostant said she had suffered 'appallingly unfair treatment' during the disciplinary procedure and the panel accepted she was 'upset and humiliated' by Mr Holland's behaviour. After winning compensation the single mother who is divorced and has a 17-year-old son said: 'Mr Holland told other staff he was a born Christian but his behaviour towards me was hardly Christian-like.' Mrs Raza, from Sheffield, a British Asian who came to the United Kingdom 18 years ago, had worked in a Citizen's Advice Bureau, for a letting agent and as a cleaner before taking the job at Whirlow Grange in November, 2009. Christian centre: The Archbishops of York and Canterbury have stayed at Whirlow Grange in the past . She earned just £93 a week in her job which involved cleaning, helping in the kitchen and general household duties. Since she was sacked she has lived on £71 a week Job Seekers Allowance and has suffered ill health which requires her to see a psychiatrist once a month. She claims her former 'sunny disposition' was wrecked after her dismissal and blames Mr Holland, who left Whirlow Grange in September last year, for her plight. Her doctor says she is suffering from 'enormous stress' and is currently unfit for work. She is practically penniless and still has a mortgage and bills to pay and represented herself at the tribunal after running up legal bills of £2,500. She said: 'I was accused of flirting with everybody from the chef to the gardener. It was all rubbish just to fabricate a claim of sexual harassment against me. 'In the beginning I thought Graham Holland was a good person. Then he started bullying me to the point where I used to cry at work. He barked at me like a bulldog and swore at me for no reason. 'He treated me like a piece of dog dirt. He didn't speak to any other member of staff like that. He couldn't stand me for some reason and made my life hell.' Whirlow Grange and Mr Holland jointly have to pay the £43,000 compensation. He is liable to pay £3,000.

Bankers who behave irresponsibly will face criminal charges, David Cameron promised today. The Prime Minister revealed the Government would change the law to catch reckless behaviour in the City and claw back bonuses from banks which had been bailed out with taxpayers' cash. The pledge came after a major report recommended bosses of failed banks should face . jail or lose the right to claim bonuses for up to ten years for . 'reckless misconduct'. Prime Minister David Cameron promised to take action against reckless bankers and claimed Labour had failed to properly regulate the banks before the 2007 crash . The new criminal offence would make . sure that top executives paid for their 'shocking and widespread . malpractice', the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards said. Not . a single British banker has been sent to prison since the financial . crash began in 2007, but the proposed legislation would make sure they . would be 'on the hook' in future, it added. As well as prison terms, errant . bankers would face heavy fines and bans from the financial services . industry, as well as curbs on bonuses and the threat of pensions being . cancelled. In the Commons, Mr Cameron was pressed on whether he supported the recommendations on bonuses and criminal penalties. 'Yes, I do support both of those measures,"" he said. 'Obviously we need to take time to read this excellent report. 'But . penalising, including criminal penalties against bankers who behave . irresponsibly, I say yes. Also, making sure that banks who are in . receipt of taxpayers' money that you can claw back... bonuses, I say yes . too.' Rise: Bonus pay rose dramatically in April this year, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics . However Mr Cameron came under pressure from Labour leader Ed Miliband over a surge in bankers' bonuses. Payouts in the City soared to record . levels in April this year as bankers deferred pay outs to take advantage . of the cut in the top rate of tax. During an intense clash at Prime . Minister’s Questions, Mr Miliband revealed the figures from the Office . for National Statistics which showed that bonuses in the business and . financial services this April were 64 per cent higher than a year ago. BT chief executive Ian Livingston is to become a government minister. He will replace former HSBC chairman Lord Green as trade minister when he stands down at the end of the year. David Cameron told MPs: 'I . can announce today that Ian Livingston, for the past five years chief . executive of BT, one of Britain's most successful businesses, will take . on this vital role. 'I believe he will bring huge talent to a vital national effort.' The . Labour leader said: ‘The reality is that bonuses are up 64 per cent in . April in the City because he has cut the top rate of tax from 50p to . 45p. ‘So people took their bonuses in April and got a massive tax cut as a result.' He added: ‘For all his tough talk the reality is he is dodging his responsibility on banking reform. ‘Lending is falling, bonuses are rising and while ordinary families are suffering he is giving a tax cut to millionaires.’ Average . weekly bonuses payments in finance and business services were £143 in . April, up 64.4 per cent on the same time in 2012 and the highest level . in records dating back to 2000. Mr Cameron took aim at Labour’s record in power, blaming them for a failure to regulate. The . Prime Minister said: ‘Bankers bonuses were about a third of what they . were when he was in the Treasury. They have been going down not up.’ On a day when failures in banking were again in the headlines, Mr Cameron also revealed former HSBC boss Stephen Green is to stand down as a trade minister later this year. He will be replaced by BT chief executive Ian Livingstone. In its 527-page report, the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards found that 'deep lapses in standards have been commonplace'. Commission chairman Andrew Tyrie MP . said: 'Under our recommendations, senior bankers who seriously damage . their banks or put taxpayers' money at risk can expect to be fined, . banned from the industry, or, in the worst cases, go to jail. That has . not been the case up to now. 'This deals with some of the senior people who many feel got off lightly last time and for whose mistakes we are still paying.' Disgraced: Sir Fred Goodwin, chairman of the Princes Trust Scotland at a charity clay pigeon shoot event near Dundee, 2003 . 'It is not . just bankers that need to change. The actions of regulators and . governments have contributed to the decline in standards,' said Tory MP . Mr Tyrie. The commission of MPs and peers calls . for a sweeping overhaul of top pay, with City regulators given new . powers to cancel pension rights and payoffs for the bosses of bailed-out . banks. It also wants watchdogs to be able to . force banks to defer bonus payments for up to a decade, in order to . prevent bosses reaping large rewards for risky, short-term strategies . that subsequently lead to losses. 'The rewards for fleeting, often . illusory success have been huge, while the penalties for failure have . been much smaller, or non-existent,' Mr Tyrie said. However, John Cridland, director . general of the CBI, said: 'There are tough criminal sanctions in the UK . for those who engage in fraudulent behaviour. Enforcing those must come . before the introduction of new sanctions.' The findings of the commission, set up . last summer in the wake of the Libor scandal, are not binding, but the . Government is being urged to implement its recommendations 'in full'. The proposals will now be handed to ministers. The reforms will aim to . prevent a repeat of the bailouts and scandals such as Libor . rate-rigging, where bosses have walked away with large payoffs and . pensions. But bankers will not be targeted . retrospectively. Fred Goodwin, who left RBS in ruins but is still . receiving a pension of £342,000 a year for life, will be unaffected. Nor will any legislation ensnare . former HBOS boss James Crosby, who will collect £406,000 of his . £580,000-a-year retirement deal. Under current rules, senior bankers . have been able to evade punishment by claiming they were not personally . responsible for collapses and that they had not committed deliberate . fraud, with the onus  on financial authorities to prove wrongdoing. But in the new proposed regime, top . managers would be held individually accountable and would have to show . they took 'all reasonable steps' to avoid a failure. 'A . lack of personal responsibility has been commonplace throughout the . industry,' Mr Tyrie added. 'Senior figures have continued to shelter . behind an accountability firewall.' The . commission also wants a new licensing system to stop traders involved . in setting Libor rates and prevent area managers who oversee the sale of . financial products from slipping through the net. They will have to abide by a new set of conduct rules or lose their licence. The . report also recommends that City watchdogs should be able to force . badly-behaved banks to sign a formal agreement to improve their culture . and standards. The . commission – whose members include the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin . Welby and former Chancellor Lord Lawson – also demands the dismantling . of UK Financial Investments (UKFI), the body that is supposed to manage . taxpayers' holdings in RBS and Lloyds at arms' length from ministers. It said the Government, which denies . forcing the resignation of RBS boss Stephen Hester, has interfered in . the running of the two banks and that UKFI is seen as a 'fig leaf' for . 'the reality of direct government control'. Ministers must also make an immediate . commitment to analyse whether RBS should be split up into a 'good bank', . that could lend more to small firms and personal customers, and a 'bad . bank' to dump its toxic assets, the commission said. A . study of high street lenders by competition watchdogs and an . independent panel of experts to look at measures to help bank customers . were also part of the recommendations. Lord . Oakeshott, a former LibDem Treasury spokesman, said: 'Why are there no . banged-up bankers? That is what most people want to know after the last . five years of scandals and shame and moral and financial bankruptcy.' He . added: 'We must stop the subterfuge of UKFI and put the Treasury on the . spot to make the banks we own lend. 'RBS, our biggest business bank, has . failed the nation that rescued it at £1,500 for every taxpayer. It must . be broken up with new management and tough net lending targets for the . good bank so small business can grow again.'","New criminal offence to tackle 'shocking and widespread malpractice'

Bez and Ksaka the Colobus monkeys are actually pictured below celebrating the arrival of their son Alan, the second ever of their species to be born at Cotswold Wildlife Park in Oxfordshire. Young Alan, who had white fur when he was born three months ago, is now slowly growing black fur to resemble his parents. When Alan the Colobus monkey was born at Cotswold Wildlife Park in Oxfordshire he had white fur . Look at me now: At three months old, baby Alan has started to develop the contrasting fur of his parents . And while he will probably end up looking as miserable as they do, for now he looks rather happy with his new look. Native to Africa, Colobus monkeys are actually extremely sociable, despite the colouration of their fur giving them an unhappy look. With the arrival of the new sunnier weather, Alan has been enjoying bouncing around his enclosure with his sibling, Christopher, and the rest of his family group. Park curator Jamie Craig said: 'The group now has two playful infants to keep an eye on as they make the most of the warm spring weather. 'All adults take a role in babysitting and luckily, Kasaka is a very patient dad.' The newest born was named after employee Alan Price, who has worked at Cotswold Wildlife Park since 1997 and says Colobus Monkeys are his favourite species. Alan as a new-born Colobus monkey clung to his mother, and had white fur which is all now turning black . He is bigger now, but he still enjoys a cuddle from mum in his enclosure at Cotswold Wildlife Park . They live in family groups comprising . one male, several females, and their offspring, and female Colobus . monkeys usually announce that they are ready to mate by tongue smacking. With females giving birth to a single offspring approximately every 20 months, Ksaka has got his work cut out for him. In the wild, males leave their birth groups before they are fully mature, either by choice or by force, and live alone or in small bachelor groups. Some will eventually take over a harem of their own. Each group has its own territory in the tree canopy that is well defined and defended. The word 'colobus' is derived from the Greek 'kolobus', meaning 'mutilated one'. It refers to their thumb, which is little more than a short stub. The Colobus monkeys are extremely sociable and live in large family groups comprising a male, the females he mates with, and their offspring . You're never too old for a cuddle: Despite being the grand old age of three months, Alan like a hug with his mother . The monkeys run on all fours along familiar routes through branches, and take turns sleeping at night so that one member of the troop is always awake and watching for predators. Males defend their group and territory from others with roars, tongue-clicks, chases, and an unusual stiff-legged display.","Colobus monkey Alan has shed white fur and is going dark like his parents .

The Obamas touched down in Berlin on Tuesday evening for a whirlwind 24-hour visit to Germany, the culmination of which will be the President's speech at the Brandenburg Gate. The First Lady had made a quick change into a sleek black trouser-and-cardigan combo with studded belt while daughters Malia and Sasha were all smiles in short dresses and neon accessories. The President left the plane holding his youngest daughter Sasha's hand, waving to the crowds gathered at Tegel Airport. Michelle followed with eldest daughter Malia who had styled her white lace dress with biker boots. Mr Obama's speech today will inevitably be compared with JFK's 1963 address to the German capital in which he declared 'Ich bin ein Berliner' in solidarity with residents of West Berlin at the height of the Cold War. During the brief trip, the President will hold meetings with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other government officials but is likely to face some tough questions over his handling of the NSA surveillance scandal.

On trend: Malia Obama, 14, contrasted a white pretty dress with biker boots while her 11-year-old sister Sasha wore a checked dress, neon shoes and matching accessories . He arrived in Berlin following the two-day, G8 summit at Lough Erne in Northern Ireland. There have already been tense moments on the trip, in particular during the President's discussions with Russian leader Vladimir Putin over the Syrian crisis. During the summit, Michelle and daughters traveled to the Republic of Ireland to do some sightseeing. At points, Malia and Sasha had seem less than enthralled with the outings including a visit to the medieval Book of Kells in Trinity College, Dublin and the picturesque Glendalough. The First Lady and her girls kept it casual for the short jaunt, spending Tuesday in jeans and sneakers and enjoying a pub lunch with rock star Bono. It was all change when the family landed on the continent with Obama appearing to have found the tie he ditched during the summit while his wife and daughters ramped up their White House star quality. The President's visit comes nearly 50 years to the day after John F. Kennedy's famous Cold War address in Berlin.

Jetset: Obama is met by officials at the airport in Berlin after a short flight from Northern Ireland .

Europe over the NSA surveillance of American citizens. Protesters gathered on Tuesday at Checkpoint Charlie - the Berlin Wall crossing point . between East Berlin and West Berlin during the Cold War - to show their . outrage at the Obama administration's surveillance of email and phone records.

Demonstrators . held up signs reading 'Yes We Scan' - playing on Obama's 2008 . presidential campaign slogan - along with the words 'Your privacy ends . here'. The U.S. leader was also likely to face tough questions from German officials over the NSA matter and leaks about the agency's secretive methods by whistleblower Edward Snowden. Germany's federal data protection commissioner, Peter Schaar, has already called the U.S.'s access of thousands of private social media and email accounts 'monstrous', according to the New York Times. Casual look: Michelle Obama with daughter Malia and Sasha in jeans and sweatshirts while visiting Glendalough in Ireland earlier on Tuesday . Obama will tomorrow set himself up as the heir to JFK when he makes a speech in Berlin in front of the Brandenburg Gate. It . is almost exactly 50 years since JFK addressed a crowd of Germans at . the height of the Cold War and declared: 'Ich bin ein Berliner.' His . successor as U.S. President will attempt to channel the memory of that . historic occasion when he delivers an address in the aftermath of the G8 . summit in Northern Ireland. Obama's speech on Wednesday will not be the first one he has given in Berlin. Speech: Barack Obama, pictured today at the G8 summit in Northern Ireland with David Cameron and Francois Hollande, is set to give an address in Berlin on Wednesday . Parallels: John F. Kennedy delivered an iconic speech in Berlin on 26 June, 1963 - almost exactly 50 years ago . Five years ago, when he was still seeking election as President, Mr Obama received a rapturous reception on a brief tour of Europe where he was greeted as a leader who could give the world a fresh start after the controversial presidency of George W. Bush. Now he is a much more divisive figure - although his re-election last year was welcomed by most Europeans, recent revelations about his administration's spying on internet communications have tarnished his record in the eyes of many. Mr Obama's speech tomorrow will inevitably be compared with JFK's, which took place on June 26, 1963 at the Rathaus Schöneberg, a few miles away from the Berlin Wall which had been under construction over the previous two years. Kennedy's speech, considered one of his best, held up West Germany as a symbol of freedom on the front line of the battle against communism. It featured the famous line: 'All free men, wherever they may live, are citizens of Berlin, and therefore, as a free man, I take pride in the words, ""Ich bin ein Berliner!""' People have since suggested that the German quotation was in fact a mistranslation, meaning 'I am a jelly doughnut' rather than 'I am a Berliner', although no one appeared to comment on this at the time. When Mr Obama, than a senator for Illinois, visited Berlin in 2008, he gave a speech to a crowd of more than 200,000 people, attracting headlines such as 'Germany meets the superstar'. For his visit this week, by contrast, leading magazine Der Spiegel greeted him with the headline 'The Lost Friend'. Although the President remains broadly popular among Germans, many are angry with his failure to close Guantanamo bay and the U.S. policy of targeting Islamic militants with drone attacks. Moreover, recent revelations about the National Security Agency monitoring phone calls and internet use have further shaken his image. 'He is still popular but not like he was,' Henning Riecke, who heads the transatlantic relations programme at the German Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin, told Reuters. 'There's disappointment in Germany that he hasn't been able to close Guantanamo and there are concerns about his tactics in fighting terrorism. People have realised he's not a saint and he's not all-powerful.' Last time: Mr Obama drew a crowd of 200,000 for a speech he gave during his election campaign in 2008 . Meeting: The President is set to hold talks with German chancellor Angela Merkel; they are pictured in 2011 . Mr Obama, who has not visited Germany since becoming President, is believed by many to have neglected Europe in favour of regions such as Asia and the Middle East. He will give a speech to 4,000 invited guests on the eastern side of the Brandenburg Gate, in the Pariser Platz square - apparently chosen to avoid an embarrassing contrast with the turnout in 2008. German chancellor Angela Merkel is likely to seek to take advantage of the meeting to boost her own chances of re-election ahead of the polls in September. Talks between the two are likely to touch on issues including the ongoing eurozone crisis, the extent of the U.S. surveillance programme and the future of war-torn Syria. Ms Merkel, who hails from the centre-Right, is sometimes said to have enjoyed better relations with George W. Bush, who invited her to his ranch in Texas and quizzed her about growing up in East Germany. Setting up: A worker prepares the area around the Brandenburg Gate for Mr Obama's speech .

A British soldier who has served in Afghanistan, Bosnia and Northern Ireland is to be extradited to America over allegations of a $100,000 fraud. David McIntyre, 41, lost a legal battle in the High Court on Friday, when a judge dismissed medical evidence that showed he is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and now faces a possible 20-year jail sentence. It is the latest case involving Britain’s controversial extradition treaty with America which critics say discriminates against Britons. David McIntyre is to be extradited over $100,000 dollar fraud concerning security for an American Peace Group in iraq . The claim against Mr McIntyre concerns a contract to provide security in Iraq for a US peace group for which he was working after he first left the Army. The former soldier insists he is innocent and is the victim of a plea bargain in which a US official, accused of similar offences, named him to secure a lenient sentence. Mr McIntyre served with the Queen’s Lancashire Regiment from  1996 to 2002. When he left, he  set up his company to provide security to American clients. Mr McIntyre enrolled in the Royal Military Police after  his business ended and the allegations emerged last July when he was stationed in Camp Bastion, Afghanistan. He said yesterday: ‘I would not volunteer to go to Afghanistan to be killed or maimed if I had a secret slush fund of $100,000 under the bed.’ David McIntyre lost a legal battle on Friday when a judge dismissed claims that he has Post Traumatic Stress Disorder . David McIntyre served with the Queen's Lancashire Regiment from 1996 to 2002 . This newspaper has seen a military psychiatric report which says that Mr McIntyre suffers from PTSD. It warns he is a suicide risk and that there could be ‘potentially tragic’ consequences if he is extradited. Mr McIntyre, who is being represented by law firm Kaim Todner, added: ‘I think, after serving my country all my life, the least I can expect is to be helped with my PTSD and allowed to prove my innocence in my own country. ‘I am fearful that I would  take my own life as I would rather be dead than be locked  up in an American prison away from my family.’ Melanie Riley of Friends Extradited said: ‘David clearly needs treatment for his PTSD and if he’s broken any laws he should be tried in the UK.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","David McIntyre lost a legal battle when judge dismissed claims he has PTSD .

It took 12 firefighters three hours to decide how to rescue this lamb after it fell down a well in Shropshire - they used a ladder in the end . A team of 12 firefighters rushed to a farm in three fire engines to rescue a lamb that had fallen down a well. Emergency services sped to the scene at midday yesterday, and spent nearly three hours discussing their plan of action. Eventually they came to a conclusion and at 3pm they finally used a crane to lower a ladder 32ft (10m) down into the well so a lone fire officer could climb down and carry the lamb to the surface. The uninjured animal was then returned safely to its mother at Shepherds Whym Farm, Bishop's Castle, Shropshire, and fire crews left the scene. The Shropshire Fire and Rescue operation is believed to have cost around £6,000, based on the cost of having three tenders and a dozen men out for three hours. Residents who gathered at the scene in the Shropshire countryside to watch the rescue operation were left questioning why it took so many firefighters to rescue one stranded lamb. Student Kayleigh Parker, 21, said: 'All it took was a ladder and one man to climb down there and back out again. 'I sincerely hope it didn't keep them from attending any serious incidents that were going on elsewhere because it seemed a disproportionate reaction.' Father-of-four Phillip Hall, 36, added: 'Firefighters do an amazing job but you really have to question why one lamb really needed three fire engines and a dozen men. 'You could see them all standing there figuring out how best to approach the operation. I was thinking ""Just get on with it"". Three fire engines and 12 firefighters rushed to the scene in the middle of the Shropshire countryside yesterday . After three hours of deliberation, the firefighters lowered a ladder into the well and brought the lamb out . 'All they did in the end is lower a ladder down and one bloke was down and back out in no time.  It was hardly a major operation - I have seen fewer fire engines at actual fires.' A spokesperson for Shropshire Fire & Rescue Service said: 'The lamb was remarkably calm after its ordeal and seemed content as it was returned to its mother. 'It is not known how the lamb got down there but seemed to be fine and ran off when placed back on firm ground.' Fire brigades spent at least £3.5m in three years rescuing animals including a snail, a lost duckling and seven dolphins, according to figures released in 2011. The three-hour rescue operation had a happy ending, but at an estimated £6,000 cost to the taxpayer .","Three fire engines raced to scene and firemen put a ladder down the well .

Vicky Pryce has been moved from the harsh regime of Holloway Prison in North London to an open jail in the Kent countryside. Pryce and her ex-husband, disgraced former Cabinet Minister Chris Huhne, were both sentenced to eight months for perverting  the course of justice after she ‘accepted’ his speeding points ten years ago. Last night, the economist told a friend: ‘I’m fine.’ She added that she was ‘settling in’ at East Sutton Park open prison near Maidstone and insisted staff were treating her very well. Jailed: Vicky Pryce, the ex-wife of former energy secretary Chris Huhne, pictured inside the window of a prison van as she was taken to Holloway Prison where she was moved after only four days . On Monday, Pryce, 60, who was convicted after a retrial at Southwark Crown Court, spent her first night behind bars at Holloway, Europe’s largest women’s jail, which has a reputation as a daunting institution for first-time prisoners. But just four days later, after a risk assessment by Holloway staff, she was driven 30 miles in a prison bus to the more relaxed regime of East Sutton Park. The Ministry of Justice describes the Grade II-listed 15th Century building as a ‘pleasant mansion house overlooking the Weald of Kent’ while prison inspectors say it produces ‘unusually good outcomes’ for the 100 women it holds. During her time there, Pryce will work on the prison farm, where she will be expected to dig and weed alongside fellow prisoners – or ‘residents’. Guilty: Pryce and former Cabinet minister Huhne were both sentenced to eight months for perverting the course of justice after she ‘accepted’ his speeding points ten years ago . They include April Casburn, the disgraced former Detective Chief Inspector convicted in January of corruption after attempting to sell information about the phone-hacking investigation. Casburn, 53, contacted the News of the World to discuss Scotland Yard’s decision to launch a new investigation into hacking. She claimed she made the call because the public should know that counter-terrorism officers were being used to investigate hacking instead of ‘saving lives’. Another well-known East Sutton Park inmate was Jane Andrews, the Duchess of York’s former dresser who is serving life for stabbing to death her former lover Tom Cressman in 2000. Andrews went on the run from East Sutton in 2009 and has now been sent to a closed prison. Pryce – one of Britain’s leading economists – was jailed with her former husband after jurors rejected her claim that Huhne  bullied her into accepting his penalty points in 2003 so he would not lose his driving licence. Settling: Pryce was moved to East Sutton Park open prison near Maidstone, described as a 'pleasant mansion house', where a friend said she was 'settling in' Although it is an open prison, East Sutton Park’s dormitories and lack of privacy will still be a far cry from the £2 million South London home she once shared with her former husband. Last week her family raised concerns about her physical and mental state. Her brother George Courmouzis said he was ‘worried’. ‘Our family has no experience of going to prison,’ he told BBC Radio. ‘Physically, Vicky is very frail.’ Meanwhile, Huhne remains within the bleak Victorian walls of Category B Wandsworth Prison in South London, which is home to 1,600 hardened convicts. The former Energy Secretary’s spirits are said to be undimmed by his first experience of imprisonment. His girlfriend Carina Trimingham said: ‘He is getting on well both with inmates and officers.’ Huhne is also expected shortly to be moved to an open prison. Provided that both he and Pryce keep out of trouble they can be expected to be released within two months, having served just a quarter of their sentences. ... but former inmate warns: It's so sinister she'll soon long to be back in her old cell . My impressions of East Sutton Park were initially promising: a female open prison in a red-brick Elizabethan manor deep in the Kent countryside with gardens designed by Capability Brown. It was certainly a world apart from Holloway, the daunting jail for 500 offenders where I spent two years of a five-year sentence for fraud, and which is now home to Vicky Pryce, economist ex-wife of disgraced Cabinet Minister Chris Huhne. Pryce has been given an eight-month sentence for perverting the course of justice after ‘accepting’ Huhne’s driving points. New home: East Sutton Park open prison near Maidstone in Kent, an an 15th century Elizabethan manor . But as a low-risk, white-collar offender she will be moved to East Sutton Park within the next two weeks. Contrary to expectations, this is not a cushy number. While Holloway, where you are locked up for 18 hours a day, has its own challenges, for an educated middle-class woman such as Pryce, the regime at an open prison – where the walls are psychological, the competitive atmosphere suffocating and the rules petty and patronising – may prove unbearable. Granted, when I arrived at East Sutton, I was astounded to be offered coffee – a luxury at Holloway – and tobacco. I was no longer a prisoner, but a ‘resident’, and staff called me ‘Kate’ rather than ‘Miss Johns’. I could use nail varnish, had more than two pairs of shoes and glass perfume bottles – previously confiscated because they could be used as weapons. I could walk in the grounds until 11pm and use the telephone without asking permission. At ‘Hotel Holloway’ (there was an ironic sign in the prison’s reception) my cell had worn lino floors and steel walls painted institutional mint green. Unbearable: The former inmate warned that a 'middle-class woman' like Pryce may find her new surroundings 'unbearable' I was served Sunday roast with rice and had plastic cutlery. Now my ‘bedroom’ was carpeted  and oak-panelled, with an original fireplace. We had fresh vegetables, meat and a salad bar and were allowed to eat with metal knives and forks off china plates – a luxury. But before long I saw the formidable downside of East Sutton Park. As a working prison, ‘residents’ were required to graft on the farm, and in the gardens and kitchens, putting in eight hours a day for an average salary of £14 a week. It was often back-breaking, especially if, like Pryce, you are used to sitting in an office, firing off emails. I regularly mucked out dozens of pigs. Not easy: Former city lawyer and ex-inmate of East Sutton Park Kate Johns said the prison stay was 'humiliating' More humiliating were the menial roles such as cleaning toilets and taking rubbish out, for which we were paid two pence. We also shared rooms: I lived with a senior police officer convicted of theft, and a septuagenarian murderess approaching parole after a life sentence. She was said to be so determined for release that she informed on other inmates for cash. While ‘grassing up’ a fellow inmate may be considered unacceptable in television dramas, it was a culture that was almost encouraged at East Sutton Park. The governors were reliant on informants and seemed overtly affected by the ‘celebrity’ of some residents. Your ‘press file’ (newspaper cuttings) was used for risk assessment and to identify those with ‘assertive tendencies’. Staffing, which had been limited at Holloway, was excessive at the open prison and for the first time in my sentence I became conscious of being scrutinised, to an extent that felt obsessively intrusive. Staff listened to my telephone calls and discipline was dished out for the pettiest reasons. Those who were allowed out on day release had to write down everything in their handbag, even including their brand of eyeliner. Strip searches were the norm. Thankfully, I never experienced one, but some women came back tearful and traumatised. We were also regularly subjected to room ‘spins’, where dormitories were turned upside down by staff on the merest inkling we had contraband. Punishments varied from loss of day release to the nuclear option: ‘closed conditions’. Staff used them both, punishing residents randomly and threatening to restrict access to families, friends and children. Holloway has an established reputation for violence, but I discovered a certain camaraderie between the inmates. That did not exist at East Sutton Park, where residents appeared to be in competition. We also faced threats of violence. One Sunday I was typing up a witness statement – we had access to computers but not the internet – when two women serving life complained that I was typing ‘too loudly’ (they could only type with one hand and had probably never heard anyone touch-typing). They suggested I should leave the room or get ‘hurt’. I promptly left. In the past I have said that prison saved my life. It certainly gave me a reality check after years spent in an ivory tower in the City. Perhaps it will do the same for Pryce. But if her experience in open prison resembles mine, she may yet find she longs for the monotony of Hotel Holloway.

A man who wanted to claim asylum in Britain and said he was a child to avoid deportation was caught out when staff at his children's home noticed he had facial hair. They also thought the Afghan's deep voice and tattoo were incompatible with his claim of being 12. However it took four years until they were able to prove the Afghan's real age. Staff at the children's home noticed the 12-year-old' shaved and had a deep voice and tattoo (file pic) Now, finally, the young man - who is now 22 - faces being sent back to his country following an immigration tribunal in London. The asylum seeker came to Birmingham hidden on a lorry in December 2008, saying his mother had told him he was 12 just before he left Afghanistan. He said his grandfather had urged him to escape his homeland because he was in trouble with people there for something his father had done. The young man - then nearly 18 - claimed he was 12 because being classed as a lone minor gives asylum seekers a better chance of being allowed to stay in the UK. Border authorities do not have facilities for looking after children, so they are often put into children's home while courts decide their fate, and being classed as children can help their cases. Staff at the Birmingham children's home he was placed in became suspicious because he arrived with a small moustache that disappeared overnight, and had a deep voice and a tattoo on the back of his hand. The asylum seeker arrived in Birmingham, pictured, in December 2008 hidden in a lorry . Social worker Swaran Singh told judges at the immigration tribunal that he had assessed several Afghans seeking asylum in Britain, the Sun reported. He said: 'A high proportion [of Afghans] claim their mothers told them how old they were a short time before leaving their country. 'This sounds like a stock phrase and I wonder whether agents advise individuals to say this.' The hearing found no evidence of the man being persecuted at home, nor did they track down any relatives, but the judges ruled: 'The applicant's lack of credibility points strongly towards him being above or very close to attaining the age of maturity when he arrived in the UK.'","Afghan was nearly 18 when he arrived in Britain .

The Kremlin is to pursue the  family of dead oligarch Boris Berezovsky over £300 million it claims he owed the Russian state. Mr Berezovsky, 67, was found dead at his estate in Ascot, Berkshire, on March 23 after spending 13 years in exile campaigning against Vladimir Putin's regime. But yesterday Moscow said it would target . Mr Berezovsky's 'heirs' to recover his fortune, which it said belonged to the Russian government. Pursued: Boris Berezovsky, who was found dead at his Ascot home in Berkshire, and former wife Galina . 'Persecution': The move by Moscow led to claims Russian President Vladimir Putin was persecuting Mr Berezovsky's family in the same way he orchestrated a 'campaign of harassment' against the tycoon . The move led to claims that Putin was persecuting Mr Berezovsky's family in the same way that he had orchestrated a 'campaign of harassment' against the tycoon while he was alive. Mr Berezovsky's friends have blamed the Kremlin's 'war of litigation' for his recent depression which many believe contributed to his death. A post mortem revealed that his injuries were consistent with hanging. Tycoon: Mr Berezovsky and his partner Ylena Gorbunova outside the High Court in London . The claims against Mr Berezovsky's 'heirs' relate to money Moscow prosecutors say belongs to national airline Aeroflot and the AvtoVAZ car company. Mr Berezovsky's six children, two former wives and former girlfriend face defending legal action from Russian investigators in the UK, where many of them live. Mr Berezovsky's former £2 billion fortune had been reduced by a divorce settlement of £200 million for his second wife Galina Besharova, 53. He also ran up lawyers' bills of £150 million, while former partner Yelena  Gorbunova had secured a court order freezing £200 million of his assets. The oligarch's property portfolio, including the £20 million Ascot mansion, is vulnerable to litigation. Acutely aware that the Kremlin might one day come after his family, Mr Berezovsky had set up elaborate offshore trusts to protect his former wives and his children. In a separate development, The Mail on Sunday has learned that Mr Berezovsky was due to tell the inquest into the death of Alexander Litvinenko that the former spy was working with Western agencies investigating Putin over money-laundering allegations.

Although FIFA maestros EA tried to tackle the rugby market, each attempt paled in comparison to Codemasters' 1997 classic. But that hasn't stopped Sidhe, the developers behind countless rugby league games, trying their hand at what's proving to be a difficult sport to crack. Scrum's the word: Rugby Challenge may have some flaws, but it's on course to be a solid sports game . First impressions are promising. Menu screens are clear and crisp, and there's a FIFA-style glossiness to the animated background. Content is rich, too, boasting a Single Match, Competition, online and career modes to name but a few. It's also heavily licenced - with more than 110 teams and 50 stadia looking exactly how they should. This includes heavy hitters such as the All Blacks, Australia and the Lions, not to mention smaller teams in the RaboDirect PRO12 and Ranfurly Shield. Unfortunately, South African teams are not licenced. But for all of this authenticity, the gameplay feels very arcade like - a move which may anger purists. Fast and ferocious, there's often so much happening on screen that it's difficult to tell what's going on. Core mechanics such as passing, tackling and kicking work well, though, and although AI running lines are not as refined as rugby fans may like, it's still very enjoyable. Less enjoyable are the tedious scrum and lineout mechanics. Both involve time-sensitive button and controller presses to ensure success, but the margin for error is extremely punishing. The decision to put all out-of-hand kicking into slow-motion, too, also jars with the ebb and flow of a match. Graphically, Rugby Challenge 2 largely looks the part. Enjoyed best from a side-on perspective, animations generally hold together and stadiums are nicely detailed. Character models are less impressive, which is shame, given the number TV-style close-ups and replays broadcast during matches. Sound has been noticeably improved since 2011's Rugby Challenge. Former All Black Justin Marshall is on hand offering insightful quips and critique while Grant Nisbett follows the core action. Sadly, commentary is not quite as smooth as you'd hope for, and more than once during the match - wasn't accurate to what was going on on-screen. Arcade: Harking back to the days of Jonah Lomu Rugby, realistic gameplay has taken a back seat . But these minor gripes aside, on this evidence, Rugby Challenge 2 still looks like a strong rugby game, one that's sure to please many die-hard rugby fans.

Nazi past: A German broadcaster has dropped a detective series after its actor Horst Tappert (pictured collecting his Bambi for '98 National Film' award) was revealed as a former member of the SS . A German broadcaster has dropped repeat showings of a detective series after it emerged its late star had served in Hitler's SS.

Michael Gove yesterday dropped the European Union from the school curriculum – as EU laws were blamed for helping to sink his flagship plans to scrap GCSEs. Pupils will no longer be required to learn about the organisation in geography lessons while citizenship classes will merely specify studying the UK’s ‘relations with the rest of Europe’. The move is part of the Education Secretary’s far-reaching overhaul of the curriculum for primary and secondary schools aimed at restoring knowledge and rigour and reversing a trend for politically-correct causes to creep into lessons. Youngsters will study a broad sweep of history, leave primary school with a basic mastery of grammar and learn all their times tables by the age of nine. But on a day of major education announcements, Mr Gove was forced to abandon his plans to replace GCSEs in key subjects with tough English Baccalaureate Certificates. He admitted that a key plank – allowing just one exam board to set tests in each subject – was currently unworkable. Fears the move would fall foul of EU procurement laws are said to have played a part in Mr Gove’s decision to shelve the changes, as he was said to have been reluctant to become mired in legal wrangling. While the name GCSE will remain, many of his other changes remain intact, including toughening up the exams, scrapping bite-sized modules and minimising coursework and internal assessment. As Mr Gove told the Commons his reforms had gone a ‘bridge too far’ and he had ‘cut his losses’, it emerged his proposed new geography curriculum for secondary schools would no longer require pupils to learn about the EU. Labour’s 2007 curriculum required pupils to study ‘different parts of the world in their wider settings and contexts, including the European Union’, and the impact of enlarging the EU on large-scale migration. Scroll down for video . Lesson plans for citizenship classes included ‘UK’s relations with the European Union and the rest of Europe’. However, Eurosceptic Mr Gove’s new curriculum says simply ‘relations with the rest of Europe’. Last night a Department for Education source said: ‘The EU is a political and economic entity rather than a geographical phenomenon, so we and our expert group agreed that teaching about it should not be specified in the geography programmes of study.’ Mr Gove said the revamped GCSEs would be introduced in key subjects in September 2015 with the first exams being taken in 2017. League tables will be overhauled so they no longer rank schools according to the proportion of pupils achieving five A* to C grades, amid concerns that teachers are encouraged to concentrate on pupils on the D/C borderline. Revenge: Gove made the move after EU laws blocked his education reforms. File picture . In a further reform, every year a random sample of pupils will be given tests in an attempt to gauge whether national standards are rising or falling. Meanwhile the new curriculum is intended to give every pupil a bank of core knowledge and replace what Mr Gove described as the ‘vapid happy talk’ in the current documents. It will be compulsory only in schools maintained by local authorities. The failure of comprehensives to give pupils a grounding in a core of traditional subjects – exposed in new Government figures – lies behind Mr Gove’s reforms. At A-level, about a quarter of state schools and colleges – more than 500 – failed to equip a single pupil with top grades in three academic disciplines last summer. And at GCSE, just 23 per cent of state school pupils were even given the chance to sit GCSEs in six academic subjects, and even fewer – 16 per cent – gained C-grade passes in them all. In a powerful speech this week, Mr Gove said his ‘English Baccalaureate’ league table measure – the percentage of pupils achieving Cs or better in six academic GCSEs – had shown ‘how poorly served so many state students were’. ‘Just six GCSEs. At C. A pass you can secure in some papers with just 30 per cent of the questions correct,’ he said. Criticising a ‘lack of ambition’, he lamented that just a quarter of secondaries – 766 – responded to a Government initiative which enabled them to send pupils to visit a top university. He said the education establishment had reacted with ‘visceral horror’ to attempts to promote traditional subjects, branding them ‘elitist’ and ‘backward-looking’, even though parents paying for private schools demanded these subjects as a right. Poorer pupils were being denied opportunities open to a privileged elite, he warned. A memo from Mr Gove’s department to the Commons select committee defending his plans to replace GCSEs in core subjects said many of the world’s highest performing countries insisted on a core of academic disciplines until pupils reached 16. It said the goal was to provide ‘students with the level of knowledge and skills expected in the highest-performing jurisdictions’.","Pupils will no longer be taught about the body in geography .

Michael Jackson's former personal chef Kai Chase has opened up about how Paris and her siblings have coped in the wake . of their father's death. During a testimony in the Jackson family's wrongful death suit against AEG Live regarding Michael's death, Chase revealed the 15-year-old, who is currently recovering in hospital following a failed suicide bid, is 'devastated and lost'. She also revealed that Paris no longer wants parties for her birthday since her father hosted a private circus for her when she turned 11. 'She's been devastated and lost': Michael Jackson's former personal chef has opened up about how Paris has been suffering following her father's death . Chase said: 'Being daddy's little girl, Paris is devastated. She's devastated and lost. She's trying to find herself and find who she is. It's . taking a lot of love and understanding to keep her together. She breaks . down, she cries, she talks about him.' Jackson's former personal chef Kai Chase testified in his wrongful death trial . Earlier in her testimony, she described an April 2009 birthday party . for Paris that included a private circus. The Cirque du Soleil-style . show featured men on stilts and a woman performing in a giant balloon, . Chase said. Paris Jackson, who was turning 11, adored her father and Chase helped . decorate a room filled with posters and photos of the Thriller . singer. The singer's music was played throughout the party. It was the last birthday party the 15-year-old has had. 'Paris hasn't . had any birthdays since,' Chase said. 'She hasn't wanted to celebrate . since'. And youngest son Blanket, who remains home-schooled, wears a T-shirt with his father's image every Friday, she said. A video deposition of Paris from . March was shown as part of the trial on Tuesday, as the teenager is . still too unwell to testify in person. The videos were used after lawyers for the Jackson family told the judge that Paris, who is suing the concert giant along with her grandmother Katherine, 83, and siblings, would be unable to testify in person due to the fact that she is still recovering in hospital. Katherine's lawsuit claims AEG failed to properly investigate Dr. Conrad Murray, who is serving a four-year prison sentence for involuntary manslaughter over the 50-year-old star’s death, and pushed the superstar to rehearse and perform a planned series of 50 comeback shows titled This Is It. Lawyers acting for Paris, Prince Michael, their brother Blanket, 10, and Katherine contend that pressure from AEG led to Jackson’s death from an overdose of surgical anaesthetic in June 2009, two weeks before his This Is It concerts were to begin at the O2 Arena in London. 'Devastated and lost': Paris and Prince with their father in 2005. He died in 2009 . Both Paris and her brother Prince are listed as potential witnesses in the case, which is in its sixth week of trial. Paris claimed in a video deposition from March that her former nanny Grace Rwaramba, seen here visiting her at hospital, was 'obsessed' with the singer . However, in the video testimonial from March which was replayed on Tuesday, Paris claimed that her  former nanny Grace Rwaramba, who has visited the teenager in hospital since her suicide attempt, was 'obsessed' with Jackson. She said: 'My dad didn’t like her so he tried to keep her away from us. He would send her to run errands a lot… He said she was sneaky, she was not an honest person and she lied a lot.' Paris added in the footage: 'She used to be (one of the nannies) but she got really creepy. This is going to freak you out. One time, it was before - me and my brother were really young - before Blanket was born. 'When he would stay in a hotel, or . whatever, she would call the hotel and say that she was his wife. She . was obsessed with him… They let her in and he’d wake up and she would be . in his bed.' Marvin S. Putnam, a defense attorney . for AEG Live, said Paris and Prince Jackson were deposed in the case . because they are named plaintiffs. He said Paris' testimony was not a . 'grilling' but urged privacy for her and her family. 'There's . a real person involved here,' Putnam said. 'There's a 15-year-old girl . and something incredibly tragic has happened that none of us know why . and I think it would really be in everyone's best interest and . particularly in her best interest if rather than blowing this up into . something else, that they were given a little bit of privacy to deal . with something that has to be a tragic, tragic moment for all of them.' 'She's 15,' he said. 'Someone should give her a break.' According to TMZ, legal papers reveal . the famous offspring are asking for $10 billion for all of the future . earnings they claim their father would have generated if he had he . lived. Seeking . damages: Paris (centre) and her siblings Blanket (L) and Prince (R) are . asking for $10 billion for all of the future earnings they claim their . father would have generated if he had he lived . According to the website the family want an additional $50 million for various other damages. AEG, . which denies any liability for the star’s death, says the huge figure . is based on speculation and that Jackson’s career was on a downward . spiral.

Still recovering: The 15-year-old is still in hospital following her failed suicide attempt earlier this month . Just days prior to her suicide bid, Paris was reportedly told that she does not share the same biological father as Prince.

Councils which turn away would-be adoptive parents for spurious reasons face being stripped of their right to run the service, ministers will warn today. New powers will allow the Government to crack down on authorities which fail to play their part in tackling a ‘chronic’ national shortage of prospective adopters and a backlog of 4,600 children waiting to be adopted. Ministers are concerned that would-be parents are coming forward to adopt only to be told ‘they are not wanted’, in some cases purely for geographical reasons. Some parents are turned away because the council they approached has no need of more adopters – even though shortages nationally are acute. Reasons given to parents include ‘we are not recruiting within our own city council’ and ‘we were out of their area’. Others fail because of arbitrary barriers, such as being overweight or too old. Recent reports revealed how couples who hope to adopt are being told that one of them must give up their job. Children’s Minister Edward Timpson will today outline plans to create new powers for ministers to intervene in councils which fail to recruit more adoptive parents and consider the needs of children nationally. They could be stripped of their role recruiting and assessing potential parents and instead required to deal with voluntary agencies to find them. Mr Timpson said: ‘There are over 4,000 children waiting to be adopted nationally but year-on-year local authorities are not recruiting enough people to give them stable and loving homes. We cannot stand by while children’s futures hang in the balance.’ He said local authorities ‘must now demonstrate that they are up to the challenge or we won’t hesitate to intervene’. Policy change: Ministers promise to remove 'race bar' which have excluded parents from adopting children of another racial background . Recent figures from Ofsted reveal how only one in eight of the couples and individuals who try to adopt children are approved by social workers, meaning that more than 22,000 would-be adopters vanish each year. Ministers have promised to sweep away barriers to adoptive parents over recent months, including race bars which have seen white parents routinely rejected as adopters of black or Asian children. The barriers to adoption have helped push down the number of children who find new families from 20,000 a year in the 1970s to few more than 3,000 now. In further measures being announced today, £150million will be restored to local authorities from cuts elsewhere to spend on adoption reforms. Referring to the plan for voluntary agencies to become involved, David Simmonds of the Local Government Association said: ‘Removing councils from the process of recruiting and screening potential adopters could adversely impact on the very children and potential adoptive parents the Government is trying to protect and should only be considered as a very last resort.’","Britain has backlog of 4,600 children waiting to be adopted .

The tiny replica of a slide projector beams a wheel of nine Instagram images onto a nearby wall, using wheels of 35mm slide film made online. The device was created by a London firm which successfully raised more than £55,000 during a Kickstarter campaign last December. And now the pocket-sized, battery-powered projectors are available to buy. Scroll down for video . The Projecteo is a tiny replica of a slide projector that can display Instagram pictures printed onto 35mm film. It is powered by batteries, which last up to eight hours, and costs £22 . Go to GetProjecteo.com and click Get Started. Sign in using your Instagram account details and choose nine photos. Once signed in your Instagram account will be connected to your Projecteo account. Pay £5.75 ($8.99) and the company will print your wheel of photos and post them to you. Put the wheel into the projector, press the red button to switch on the LEDs and point the projector at any vertical surface. The makers claim that it works best in the dark but can be used during daylight. The batteries will last for eight hours. The Projecteo project was inspired after product designer . Ben Redford came across an old projector in a London Market. Mr Redford, from London-based digital design . agency, Mint Digital, said: 'On taking it apart, I saw that the mechanics could be . miniaturised and thought Instagram would bring the warmth to how we take . photos now.' Projecteo is a tiny Instagram projector that uses wheels of 35mm slide film that can be made online. Each wheel holds nine photos and . because slide film doesn't have pixels the tiny images won't appear . pixelated or blurry when projected to a large wall. The images will shine up to 2.5-feet wide. To get the images onto the strip of . film, they are are 'melted' on to a single frame of Kodak film, which is . then processed in a similar way to how analogue films are developed, . except in full colour. The projector is a fully working system that uses pictures printed onto Kodak film instead of traditional slides. This means when the tiny images are beamed up to 2.5-feet wide on a wall they don't become pixelated . Inside the projector is a single LED light which projects the image when focused. It is powered by batteries which can be replaced . This is similar to how Hollywood film makers convert digital movies to 35mm film to . project in cinemas. 'Whether . they're of your best friends, that holiday last summer or good old . pictures of cats, just pop them into Projecteo, focus by twisting the . lens barrel and sit back to enjoy your slideshow,' claimed the Kickstarter campaign. Redford added: 'I was enthralled by the warmth of the images it projected. There's no digital image that can match it. 'We started off by 3D printing early prototypes of Projecteo. This image shows how the Projecteo measures up to a normal film projector. The mechanisms inside are exactly the same but Mint Digital scaled them down to make the Projecteo more portable . Sure, it was rough and stuck together with tape but it had enough charm to make us fall in love with the idea. We wanted to see how far we could take it. 'Through an iterative process we optimised the focal length of the lenses and added a focusing mechanism. 'We looked for the most powerful LEDs we could find, made the batteries replaceable and figured out the perfect ratio of images per wheel. The Instagram images are first chosen via the GetProjecteo website, which send the order to Mint Digital. The company 'melts' the photos onto 35mm film, pictured, and fits the film to a slide carousel wheel that costs £5.75 ($8.99) We modified the outside edges to give Projecteo a five degree chamfer, to make it a bit nicer to hold. Oh and of course, we gave it cute little feet. Redford built the projectors with a Scottish product development consultancy called Meso. The Projecteo projector costs £22 ($34.99) and the wheels are £5.74 ($8.99) each. The films are developed and sent out from New York and shipping for outside the U.S is a minimum of £3 ($5). The pictures are printed on Kodak film, with each frame being a mini slide carousel . Each carousel is then cut and placed in a special tiny holder which is placed in the projector .","The Projecteo's design is based on slide carousel projectors .

A surveillance video reveals the shocking moment a special needs teacher grabbed an autistic child by his hair before throwing him to the ground. The Florida teacher, David Baier,  lost his job at the school where the alleged abuse took place, and faces four counts of child cruelty. 'I wanted what was best for my son, and I trusted these people,'  the 12-year-old boy's mother, known only as Wendy, said. Watch the video: . Shocking: A classroom surveillance camera shows David Baier pull the 12-year-old boy up by his hair . Forceful: When the autistic boy refuses to stand, Baier is seen throwing him to the ground . The incident happened at a summer camp field trip organized by Davie Preparatory School, for children with emotional and behavioral problems, on July 27 last year. Prosecutors claim Baier was captured . forcibly throwing the autistic student to the floor, before pulling him by his hair and forcing him to stand. 'I was going to . say if you do that again I'm going to slam you,' Baier can be heard saying . on the security footage, shown by 7News. The child was being disciplined after reportedly earlier stomping on Baier's foot. He had been ordered to stand, but had crouched down by the chair. Arrest: David Baier faces four counts of child cruelty and has lost his job at the Davie, Florida school . The student can be heard crying: 'No, no, no,' as Baier walks over to him in a classroom, and grabs him by the hair. 'Now stand up and stay standing or I'm going to have to do something worse,' the teacher can be heard telling the child, whose identity has been protected. As the child whimpers and rubs his head, Baier can be heard telling him: 'I didn't think it was going to feel good.' When he asked the student why he had misbehaved earlier, the boy accused Baier of being pushy. Moments later Baier grabbed the autistic student by his neck and threw him to the ground. His mother, Wendy, was distressed by the 'thought of somebody doing this to my son and hurting him and putting him through that and not caring,' she told CBS Miami. Although the child was not physically hurt, Wendy decided to press charges after her son returned from school and told her:  'Mommy, he pulled my hair, and he threw me and it hurt.' Captain Dale Engle, of Davie Police Department, said more than a dozen complaints about the school had been received from parents since Baier's arrest. 'I understand that some of these . teachers are forced to use some type of physical force to restrain these . children,'  Captain Engle said.

Assault claim: The incident was recorded at a summer camp trip at the Alternative Education Foundation . 'But based on what I saw on the video, it was . well in excess of what any acceptable force would be,' he told the Sun . Sentinel in April.

One in four schools and colleges fail to secure good grades for any of their pupils at academic A-levels. For the first time, schools are being ranked according to how many sixth-formers achieve AAB grades at subjects preferred by leading universities. The list includes maths, English literature, physics, biology, chemistry, geography, history and languages. Magdalen College School in Oxford was joint top of the league table for the number of students who achieved the preferred university entry grades AAB . But tables published yesterday show that 600 sixth-forms had no pupils at the required level. Nationally, 6.5 per cent of students achieved the AAB benchmark. Private schools fared significantly better, prompting warnings that a new educational divide was ruling poorer pupils out of the race for sought-after university places. St Paul’s Girls in London and Magdalen College School in Oxford – both fee-paying – topped the 2012 table in having 70 per cent of pupils at AAB level. Private schools took 150 places in the top 200, the remaining 50 largely being grammars. Chris Skidmore, a Tory member of the Commons education select committee, said league table measures which highlighted performance in traditional subjects ‘shone a torch’ on under-performance. Warning: Tory MP Chris Skidmore, who sits on the Commons education committee, said the tables demonstrated an 'educational divide' between the achievements of poorer and better off students . ‘They will force schools to move into the 21st century and wake up to the fact that universities will require these rigorous qualifications,’ he said. ‘These results clearly show an educational apartheid, effectively an educational Berlin Wall, between some of the most affluent schools in the country and the most disadvantaged. ‘We must raise standards in the poorest areas. It would be wrong to level down our universities, which are some of the most respected in the world. ‘Every pupil, regardless of their background, must be encouraged to study the subjects that matter. ‘Too many pupils are not being put in a position of being allowed to take these subjects in the first place.’ The Russell Group – the university alliance that devised the AAB benchmark – advises sixth-formers to pick at least two key subjects to keep their course options open. Wendy Piatt, director general of the group, said: ‘A-level choices really matter. Too few students realise that some subjects and subject combinations can keep open wider degree course options at leading universities.’ The number of schools facing intervention over poor results has doubled to 215 after targets were raised. Separate figures revealed that the drift away from core academic subjects begins much earlier than sixth form in many state schools. Of 176,538 high-achieving pupils at primary school, more than half were not entered for GCSEs in five basic subject areas. Instead they were steered toward subjects seen as less rigorous such as dance and media studies.","Schools ranked nationally by how many get AAB university requirement .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 07:43 EST, 18 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:44 EST, 18 June 2013 . A teacher has been arrested on suspicion of stashing child porn on his work-issued computers - seven years after the school reportedly branded one of his students a 'troublemaker' for telling them about graphic images. Lawrence Hughes, 59, allegedly had more than 20 child porn pictures on two computers issued by Union Academy Magnet School in Polk County, Florida and was arrested last week. Now the mother of one of his former 8th-grade students has claimed her son alerted the school to the images years ago, but said officials punished the boy and told her he was a troublemaker. Caught: Middle school teacher Lawrence Hughes, 59, allegedly told police he had a pornography addiction . 'My son just blurted out, ""He has . porn on his computer"",' Joan Mac Hill told WTSP. 'I thought ""well he's a kid; he'll do anything to get out of . not having to do his homework"".' But when the boy, John Mac Hill, insisted that he was telling the truth, she told the principal. 'He said my son was a troublemaker and there was no point of fact that there was porn on that teacher's computer,' she told the news channel. When Hughes was arrested last week, she contacted school officials and police to complain. The images surfaced after a student told detectives he had been using Hughes' computer when he saw a 'pop-up' warning reading: 'You have been viewing or distributing child pornography.' Hughes, a research teacher and . 30-year veteran of the school district, promptly shut down the computer . and did not say anything about the message, according to the police . statement. Anger: Joan Mac Hill said she'd previously warned the school about porn her son found on his computer . Discovery: Her son John, pictured, was in 8th grade when he found the lewd images, his mother said . Authorities allegedly later found lewd pictures of prepubescent and pubescent boys between the ages of 12 and 16. Others showed images of children engaging in sexual acts with adults, and yet more showed nude boys engaged in sexual acts with each other, the police statement said. The student also told investigators he had been invited by Hughes with some other male students on a canoe trip earlier in the year, but did not go. He said he later saw photos of the two students, who were 13 or 14, and said Hughes 'wrestled' with one of the boys and held their hands while 'praying', ABC Action News reported. Hughes was arrested in his front . driveway as he headed for a vacation with his wife in the Carolinas; . when officers approached him, he admitted he had a porn addiction, . the sheriff said. 'He said, ""I'm addicted to pornography, but I don't download child pornography, but if it downloads I put it on a thumb drive and I take it to school and put it on the school's computers"",' Polk Sheriff Grady  said. Workplace: Hughes is a research teacher at Union Academy and has worked for the district for 30 years . Investigators are now asking students or parents who may know of inappropriate contact that Hughes may have had with children to contact them. The Sheriff's Office said that for 22 years, Hughes has been part of a mentoring program where he took young boys camping. 'He didn't say how many years he'd been addicted to porn, but I am suspicious. We know it's not his first rodeo, so who's not been reporting him in the past?' Judd asked. Mac Hill added: 'He had no right to expose those children to that. He had no right to bring his personal things into that classroom.' 10 News contacted the school district, who said they could not comment on any previous complaints because of their on-going investigation.","Lawrence Hughes 'stashed dozens of lewd images on school computers'

A mother died after attempting to save her two sons from a lethal rip-tide as they played at a holiday beach, an inquest heard today. Tragic Alison Tooby, 53, sprang into action after seeing her two sons, aged 11 and 13, getting into difficulties while body-boarding on September 3 last year. Classroom assistant Alison ran to help her stranded sons but was fatally caught in a strong current in the waves at Northcott Mouth in Bude, Cornwall. Tributes: Honeysuckle Parker-Crum, 8, Tilley, 9, and Archie, 6, lay flowers at Northcott Mouth beach where Alison Tooby died . Scene: Emergency services attempt to rescue Alison Tooby who later died after she was caught in very strong tides trying to save her two young sons . Members of the public, aided by RNLI Bude inshore lifeboat, rushed to help and rescued one boy while the other got back to shore by himself. Alison, of Taunton, Somerset, was found face down in the water and after resuscitation attempts failed she was airlifted to hospital and later pronounced dead. An inquest in Bideford, Devon, heard how the summer lifeguard cover has previously ended a day before the tragedy. In a statement, witness Rosalind Arthur, said: 'I saw a head bobbing in the waves, sometimes you could see it then the waves would obscure my view. 'I heard a scream from the woman shouting as if her life depended on it. She screamed ""help me"". 'I could not see her in distress but realised something terrible was happening in the sea, as this happened I saw her bobbing around 100 metres off shore. 'I then became aware of a young boy standing on the beach.' Martin Fry, lifeguard supervisor for the RNLI, attended the scene. He told the court it took him around three minutes to get to the beach in a 4x4 vehicle after he spotted the trio. Rescue attempt: Alison Tooby raced into the sea at Northcott Mouth near Bude, north Cornwall, last September as her two sons played in the water . He said: 'I saw a man bare chested in the water, I went straight in and could see two people in the water's edge 80 metres from shore clinging to a body board. 'At that stage these were my priority, so I went towards them, as I got closer I saw a lady in a black swimming costume face down in the water. 'My priority then changed to the lady, I paddled to her, pulled her from the water and turned her to face me and checked for vital signs but she was unresponsive.' Alison's partner, Mike McGuffie told the court: 'This was a tragic accident and I would like to thank everybody who helped. 'Especially the people who went into . the water to help because having listened to this today it is clear that . they were very brave to do that.' Recording a verdict of accidental . death, Coroner Tomalin said: 'Alison's partner has said she knew the . beach well and was certainly not of knowing her boys would be in danger. Verdict: A coroner today recorded a verdict of accidental death, but praised the actions of the 53-year-old . 'Tragedy is the right word to describe this incident in regards to losing her life but this could have been a lot worse of course as her children were also in danger. 'I am sure, as a parent would, she tried to help her children, in very difficult dangerous conditions. 'That is a reminder to all of us about the beaches in the south west and that we must respect the sea and take care. 'Please do accept my condolences to you, your family, your children and I thank you for coming today, I am sure it has not been easy.'

Kevin Bate received a 'positive reply' from One Stop after he asked the company if they could take him on as a security adviser . A convicted shop raider who was jailed after carrying out more than 20 burglaries and thefts in a year-long crime spree is heading for a new career as a security consultant for a company he targeted. Kevin Bate, from Sunderland, and his gang were responsible for stealing cash, cigarettes and tobacco from One Stop shops and other small stores across the country after causing distractions and knocking out the CCTV. Following his arrest, the 43-year-old wrote to bosses at One Stop to apologise and asked if he could be employed by them to help improve security. Teesside Crown Court yesterday heard how the company was considering recruiting the career criminal as a security adviser. However, Bate must first serve a four year jail sentence after admitting conspiracy to steal. His barrister Stephen Rich told the court how Bate wrote to the company, while he was on remand, offering his services, the Northern Echo has reported. He said: 'Astonishingly enough, he has received a reply which is positive. Unfortunately, he is going to be unavailable for consultation for some considerable time.' Six of the company's stores were hit by the gang across the country during the £30,000 spree which included One Stop shops, Co-ops, Spar stores and a number of small independent traders in areas including Northumberland, Norfolk, Cumbria and Cornwall. Bate and fellow team member Andrew Pickering, 38, from Stanley, County Durham, were jailed for four years. John Ramsay, 33, received 33 months, and John Wallis, 39, and John Carney, 42, also all from Sunderland, got five-and-a-half years. Judge Simon Bourne-Arton, QC, told them: 'If you take part in a professional conspiracy, you should expect this sort of sentence. That's part of the risk you take.' The men, who all admitted conspiracy to steal, were caught in September last year after an investigation by nine police forces. Shops in Newton Aycliffe, County Durham, Scarborough and Wallsend and Whitley Bay in North Tyneside were among those targeted.

The hassle and embarrassment of wrestling with a wind-blown umbrella could now be a thing of the past, thanks to a hemlet-style head protector. The Rainshader's canopy protects users from the wind and rain without obstructing their view and during tests in gale force seven - around 40mph - winds the umbrella didn't once blow inside out. It was designed by Warwickshire-based company Hospitality Umbrellas and has been designed not to drip on other people or poke passers-by in the face. Scroll down for video . The Rainshader's canopy protects users from the wind and rain without obstructing their view and during tests in gale force seven - 40mph - winds the umbrella didn't once blow inside out . Warwickshire-based entrepreneur Stephen Collier, pictured, redesigned the traditional umbrella with his Rainshader model. It is based on the design of a motorcycle helmet and its fibre-glass ribs and polyester canopy means it won't blow inside out, drip on other people or poke passers-by in the face . The Rainshader is based on the traditional motor helmet. It folds up and is secured by a cleverly concealed internal . Velcro strip and then fits into its handy shoulder carry case. The Rainshader has: . Ten Spoke Fibre Glass Ribs . Black Aluminium Shaft . Rubber Motor Style Grip Handle . Polyester Canopy . Shoulder Carry Case . Height 90cm . Width 5cm (when closed) Canopy Width 65cm (when open) Weight 0.5 kg . Entrepreneur Stephen Collier, 48, who owns Hospitality Umbrellas, came up with the idea during last year’s wet and windy Grand National. He wanted to design an umbrella that could be used specifically for watching sporting events in a crowd. The Rainshader has a cut-away front, which was based on the design of a motorbike helmet. This means people can see out the front of the Rainshader while protecting their head and shoulders from the wind and rain. It's design also means it doesn't obstruct the view of people standing nearby, or drip onto their shoulders. The Rainshader can also be used to protect users from the sun. Collier said: 'It was pouring with rain, the wind was howling and I was . struggling with my umbrella. 'I thought there had to be a better way. 'Traditional umbrellas have a lot of drawbacks in busy environments as . they can blow inside out and make it difficult to navigate through . crowds. 'The basic design of the umbrella hasn’t changed for centuries, so the . time is ripe for to make it more suitable to modern settings.' 'I came up with a classic motorcycle helmet shape that is shaped like a dome so it doesn't stick out and there is no longer the fear of poking somebody in the eye. 'Anyone with a normal umbrella has to lift it over their head to see where they are going but the front of the Rainshader is opened up. Collier worked with Warwick University on his Rainshader umbrella. He then tested the design in a wind tunnel at Coventry University, pictured. The Rainshader was subjected to winds up to 40mph and didn't break, rip, or turn inside out . 'Because it is slender, it is also more resistant to the wind than a normal umbrella. 'We tested ours out in a wind tunnel at 40mph and it still kept its shape whereas the regular one had popped inside out.' Collier got help from designers and product developers at the Warwick Manufacturing Group (WMG) at Warwick University. He then tested the design using a wind tunnel at Coventry University. The customisable Rainshader costs £24.99 and was specifically designed to be used in a crowd at sporting events or large outside gatherings. The caonpy completely covers the user's head and shoulders without dripping water on people stood nearby. It doesn't have the traditional 'spikes' of other umbrellas either, so doesn't poke other people in the face, or obstruct their view . Not only did Collier test the Rainshader to see if it blew inside out, it also used the wind tunnel at Coventry University to see how much the model protected his face from the wind and the wind chill . Collier tested a traditional umbrella in the tunnel, at wind speeds of gale force seven, and then tested the Rainshader. While the traditional umbrella turned inside out almost immediately, the Rainshader was relatively unaffected - it didn't turn inside out and could be used to shield Collier's face from the wind. The Rainshader has ten spoke fibre-glass ribs covered by a customisable polyester canopy . It comes with a black aluminium shaft and rubber grip handle. The canopy is 65cm wide when open and the whole umbrella weighs half a kilogram. The Rainshader is 90cm tall and can be folded up and put into shoulder carry case. It was funded by the European Regional Development Fund and the University of Warwick's International Institute for Product and Service Innovation. The Rainshader costs £24.99 but the company insists it will last longer than traditional umbrellas. During wind tunnel tests at Coventry University Collier also tested the traditional umbrella design. The umbrella turned inside out immediately when subjected to gale force winds.

The Tibetan macaque is seen sitting upright and breathing without the help of an oxygen mask at the Xijing Hospital in Xi'an, China. The monkey is the first animal to become medically stable after surviving a liver transplant using an organ from a cloned pig . The Tibetan macaque lies in an intensive care unit ten days after undergoing a liver transplant at Xijing Hospital in Xian, China. Dou Kefeng, a professor at the hospital said that the macaque was 'spontaneously' breathing and was in a stable condition . Experts said that the success of this operation is a breakthrough in the field of major organ . transplant surgeries. Doctors at the Chinese hospital had attempted the transplant earlier in May with a different Tibetan macaque and the liver from transgenic pig but the monkey died two days after . the operation. Similar experiments have also been carried out in the United States, Germany, Australia and Japan. In South Korea last June scientists transplanted a heart and kidney from a cloned pig to two monkeys but the animals did not become stable and survived for only 24 and 25 days after the operation. Doctors at the Xijing Hospital in China performed a similar operation earlier in May, however the macaque reacted badly to the pig's liver and after developing complications died two days following surgery . The Xijing Hospital has become a leader in the field of transplants using transgenic organs in China. Since 1997 doctors at the medical institute have performed more than 300 transplant operations . Xijing Hospital started the clinical research project four years ago due to a shortage of domestic and international liver donors for transplants. Speaking after the successful transplant, Dou Kefeng, a professor at the hospital told AsiaOne: 'Three hours after the transplantation, the monkey could spontaneously breathe and its vital signs were stable' He added that the organs from genetically altered pigs are preferable to human organs because the is a lower risk that the monkey's body will reject it. The longest any animal has survived after undergoing a transplant using genetically modified organs was 25 days in South Korea, last June. Korean scientists transplanted a heart and kidney from a cloned pig to two monkeys but the animals did not become stable and died 24 and 25 days after the operation .

A family who live in a renovated tugboat, complete with central heating, flat-screen TVs and a grand piano, have lost a lengthy court battle to avoid paying council tax. Randy Northrop, 57, claims his floating home is not a permanent house and he is therefore not liable to pay rates to his local authority. But after a three-year legal battle the Court of Appeal yesterday ruled the boat is liable for council tax if it remains moored in the same spot for a year. Randy Northrop (pictured left with his family in their home) claims the boat (right) is not a permanent home and so he should therefore not have to pay council tax . The boat features a music room large enough for music teacher Susan Northrop's grand piano . The handyman, his wife Susan, 55, and son Benjamin, 15, live on the 70ft boat which has a kitchen, two bedrooms, a 330 sq ft sitting room and an open fireplace. Council chiefs who discovered Randy's unusual living arrangements slapped him with a demand for £1,000 a year in council tax. But Mr Northrop says he shouldn't have to pay North Devon Council because he doesn't use their services. His 1950s, British-built tug, named Cannis, generates its own power through solar panels and the family drink rainwater. Mr Northrop said: 'The council's valuators want to band us with cottages and bungalows but we live in a tidal estuary and use a dinghy to get to the shore. 'We just don't get the sort of services someone gets in a proper house, on a proper estate, in a proper village or a proper anything. Randy Northrop, pictured with his wife Susan and son Benjamin, says the family do not receive the same council services as other rate-payers . 'We're off the grid. We generate our own electricity. We don't live on a houseboat - we live on a proper boat.' Mr Northrop bought the boat in 2001 for £11,000 after he said he became fed up with living in a run-down estate in Bristol. The family moved in almost immediately and began gutting the heavy engine machinery to make room for their new home. More than a decade later the 70ft boat has a much smaller engine and living quarters split over two levels. Mr Northrop bought the boat in 2001 for £11,000 after he said he became fed up with living in a run-down estate in Bristol. The family had to gut the heavy engine machinery to make room for living-space . Currently moored along a tidal estuary near Barnstaple, Devon, its lower deck boasts a spacious 15ft by 22ft living room, a bathroom and two bedrooms. There is also a computer nook and a music room large enough for music teacher Mrs Northrop's grand piano. The upper deck, meanwhile, has been extended upward to house a modern kitchen with a skylight. Mr Northrop, a Californian who moved to England in the late 1980s, generates his electricity through solar panels and a wind turbine with a backup diesel generator. The family process their own sewage and collect rain for drinking water or visit a nearby spring. Mr Northrop said: 'My wife's dream was always to run a musical bed and breakfast so she wanted to buy a place to fix up in the countryside. 'I was pretty certain that even a bombed-out doghouse was going to cost more than we ever had and that proved to be the case. 'But I'd lived on boats before and I said why don't we buy a big Dutch barge and live in it. The tug was the closest we came to finding one. 'It was all engine room back then but I pulled out 30 tonnes of machinery, put back in a much smaller engine and started to convert the rest into living space. 'Most of the hard work is now done but there are still bits and pieces left to do.' Mr Northrop's legal battle began in 2010 when they moved from Bristol to Devon and their self-sufficient lifestyle was featured in a newspaper article. Readers accused the family of dodging council tax and Mr Northrop says he wrote to the council to offer them a goodwill payment. He explained he had been moored in the same spot for more than a year so council evaluators replied to tell him he owed £1,000. Currently moored along a tidal estuary near Barnstaple, Devon, its lower deck boasts a spacious 15ft by 22ft living room, a bathroom and two bedrooms . After a series of hearings the case reached London's Court of Appeal yesterday where Judge Sir Alan Ward decided the Cannis becomes a taxable home when it stays permanently in the same spot. Mr Northrop has challenged North Devon Council in the wake of the ruling to reveal how much taxpayers' cash they spent chasing him. He says his own fees were met by legal aid because of his family's low income. Mr Northrop said: 'I don't make an awful lot of money but I pay as much tax as anybody else in my circumstances. We've never been on the dole. We're not scroungers or looking to cheat the system. After a three-year legal battle the Court of Appeal has now ruled the boat is liable for Band A council tax if it remains moored in the same spot for a year . 'If I had a houseboat sitting in a residential marina, with a postie slotting mail through my door, a wheelie bin and a parking space I'd be more than willing to pay - but we have none of these things. 'I'm still baffled as to what the council hope to get out of this. I'd love to know how much they've spent pursuing me - it's a criminal waste of money.'

An aerial assault has been launched on the mosquito population of Dallas for the first time in 45 years in a bid to combat the spread of deadly West Nile virus. Aircraft loaded with insecticide have sprayed parts of the north east of Dallas County, after the virus killed 10 people and left at least 230 more ill. Although commonplace in other major cities, the efforts have provoked a debate in the Dallas area between health officials trying to reduce the risk of disease and residents concerned about the dangers posed by the chemical cloud drifting down from above them. Preparing for action: An aircraft carrying insecticide is loaded with fuel before taking off to spray parts of Dallas County as part of the battle against the spread of the West Nile virus . Battle: An aircraft sprays insecticide over part of Dallas County . 'I cannot have any more deaths on my conscience because we did not take action,' Dallas mayor Mike Rawlings said. Aerial . spraying is also being used elsewhere, including in neighborhoods in . New York City and Sacramento, California, to combat the spread of West . Nile virus. Cases of West Nile Virus have also been reported in the Chicago area, with officials spraying the nearby town of Skokie with insecticide. Two people have been taken ill with the virus in Skokie, while the Chicago suburb of Lake County has reported its first case. State of emergency: The Culex quinquefasciatus mosquito is associated with transmission of the West Nile virus . Nearly half of all West Nile cases in . the United States so far this year are in Texas, however, according to . the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. If the trend continues, 2012 will be the worst West Nile year in the southern state's history. The hot, dry weather has created ideal conditions for some species of mosquito. The heat speeds up their life cycle, which accelerates the virus's replication process. And during a drought, standing water can quickly turn stagnant when it's not flushed away by rain or runoff. Dallas mayor Mike Rawlings, pictured with his wife Micky, has declared a state of emergency in his city . Parts of north Dallas are being sprayed with insecticide to combat the spread of the virus .

Covering up: Jenny Wegley is seen wading into waist-deep water to guide protective tarps over koi ponds at the Dallas Arboretum . Ponds' protection: The arboretum had crews out working to cover about 8,000 square feet of ponds with tarps to protect the aquatic ecosystems from insecticide that will be sprayed over the city from aircraft . Both the mayor and Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins have declared a state of . emergency and voiced their support for the use of aircraft to battle the virus. Yet even with the threat of . infection, the spraying has sparked widespread opposition from people . who fear the chemicals could be harmful. Because of the severity of the outbreak, the Texas Health Department is stepping in to oversee the effort and to pay for it. Research: Mosquito technician Daryl Beckwith looks through the mosquitos as local, state and federal officials are set to meet to discuss options for responding to the growing number of West Nile virus cases . Prevention: The mosquitoes seen in a laboratory will help researchers fight the disease's spread . Sorting: These dead mosquitoes await sorting at the Dallas County mosquito lab . 'This year is totally different from . the experience Texas has had in the past,' state Health Commissioner Dr. David Lakey said. 'If it's nuisance mosquitoes, we ask the city or . county to pay part of that. But in the midst of this disease outbreak, . it's easier for us to go ahead and do it.' A national spraying . company called Clarke was set to deploy two to five Beechcraft King Air . twin-engine planes for three hours of spraying. Close eye: Mosquito tech Spencer Lockwood is seen sorting the mosquitoes beneath a microscope at the Dallas County mosquito lab . Critics . have questioned whether the approach is scientifically proven to . reduce West Nile cases. But at least one study in California concluded . that the odds of infection are about six times lower in treated areas . than in those that are untreated. Still, some residents fear the chemicals could harm their children, pets and useful insects such as honeybees and ladybugs. Plans: Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings talks about aerial spraying to curb the spread of West Nile virus while standing before one of the Beechcraft aircraft being used to administer the insecticide . Target areas: A map of Dallas County highlights the areas that were planned to be sprayed by air on Thursday night . Chemical released from the planes, synthetic pyrethroid, mimics a . naturally occurring substance found in chrysanthemums. The Environmental . Protection Agency has said that pyrethroids do not pose a significant . risk to wildlife or the environment, though no pesticide is 100 percent . safe. About eight-tenths of an ounce of chemical is applied per acre. The . insecticide's common name is Duet Dual-Action Adulticide. Dr David Lakey, commissioner with the Texas Department of State Health Services, speaks to area media about the spraying of mosquitoes in Dallas County . West Nile Virus (WNV) is found in . both temperate and tropical regions, having been first identified in the . West Nile region of Uganda in 1937. It mainly infects birds and horses, and human infection is almost always transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito. Symptoms include fever, headache, excessive sweating), weakness,  drowsiness and, pain in the joints. Stronger strains of the virus can inuce nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. The most dangerous form can lead to unconsciousness, sometimes approaching near-coma, and death. Up to 80 per cent of human infections do not show any symptoms. WNV . emerged as a distinct virus around 1,000 years ago, developing into two . distinct forms. One has been transmitted in Africa and around the . world, while the other has been confined to Africa - although it has been recently detected in horses Europe. The label . says it's toxic to fish and other types of aquatic life, and it contains . distilled petroleum. Kelly Nash, . who lives in Dallas and works for an environmental consulting firm, has questioned the move. 'One . ounce an acre doesn't sound like much, but we will spray at least 2,000 . gallons all over the city,' Nash said. 'A 2,000-gallon oil spill would . be significant. 'I'm concerned that we're breeding resistant mosquitoes . that next time will have Dengue fever or something worse.' Harris . County, which includes humid, mosquito-filled Houston, has used aerial . spraying once a year since 2002, the year the virus was first detected . in Texas. 'We can't be everywhere at all . times,' Mosquito Control Director Dr. Rudy Bueno said. 'Aerial treatment . is a way to supplement what we do on the ground.' Most people . infected with West Nile virus won't get sick, but about one in 150 . people will develop the severe form of the illness. Symptoms include . headache, high fever, neck stiffness, disorientation, coma, tremors, . convulsions, muscle weakness and paralysis. Jordan Conner, 14, spent . eight days in intensive care with the most severe form of West Nile . virus. Her mother, Ebonie Conner of Arlington, said she doesn't approve . of aerial spraying and wishes local leaders would do more to educate the . community.

This is the shocking moment a greengrocer was left with a broken leg after attempting to stop a car thief stealing his 4x4 and trailer of apples by clinging on to the roof. Self-employed father-of-one Stuart Timmins suffered horrendous injuries when the truck's trailer went over his left leg, smashing it in two places and narrowly missing his head. Mr Timmins, a 48-year-old fruit and veg merchant from Gornal, West Midlands, also careened into a parked car, which shuddered from the impact because of the speed he was travelling. He was inside his shop on March 25 when he heard the car door slam and spotted Chase Edwards, 30, in the driving seat when he  ran outside to investigate. Scroll down for video . Chase: Stuart Timmins was severely injured when he tried to stop a thief stealing his 4x4 .

He fearlessly clung on to his two-tonne Mitsubishi Shogun as the thief sped away from his shop at high speed, trying to smash the driver's window and grab the keys as it raced away at 40mph. The shocking CCTV footage shows Mr Timmins desperately clinging onto the red and silver truck before losing his grip and falling into the road. He suffered a complex fracture of the tibia and fibula in his left leg as well as cuts and bruises. He had to undergo two operations, one to stabilise his leg initially and a second to insert 17 permanent pins and two plates, after the horrific accident and faces further medical procedures and months of gruelling physiotherapy.

Bystanders rushed to Mr Timmins' aid after the car sped off, leaving him with terrible leg injuries . Mr Timmins, who is still unable to walk three months after the incident, described the 'horrifying' ordeal. He . said today: 'The penny didn't drop for one minute that he shouldn't be . there then I thought ""hang on, he's trying to nick my car"", by which . time he'd got the car started.

'Unfortunately the . window didn't break as planned, by which time we had turned the corner . at the top of the drive and we were heading down the street gathering . speed. 'I thought 'I have either got to hang on and suffer the consequences or let go' and I chose to do the latter. 'In your mind's eye it was just a bit of a tumble and a roll and then you come to a halt. 'But as the footage shows it was a lot more graphic, a lot more horrific, and my injuries show that.' He added: 'Being self-employed I'm just thankful for good family and good friends that we are managing to continue on with the business.' Edwards was jailed at Wolverhampton Crown Court on Monday for various thefts, robbery, driving while disqualified and driving without insurance. He pleaded guilty to the theft of Stuart's Mitsubishi - which has never been recovered - and was jailed for four seven years and four months. Speaking after Edwards was jailed, Sergeant Clive Steedman, from Dudley Police's Offender Management Team, said: 'We hope that this sentence gives some closure to Mr Timmins as he continues to recover from his ordeal. 'We are pleased that the court recognised the severity of the crime and as a team, we will be working with the offender upon his release, along with support agencies, to help prevent re-offending.'","Stuart Timmins was crushed under the wheels of his own trailer .

The embarrassment prompted her to shed over four stone, from 13st 7lbs to 9st 8lbs. Gillian Davie, 39, lost four stone and dropped four dress sizes after being embarrassed when she bent over at work and her trousers ripped . Gillian says: 'I can laugh about it now, but one day at work I spilled some water in the kitchen and when I bent down to mop it up, I heard this huge rip and there was a large split in my trousers. 'It was so embarrassing and, what was even worse, was that one of my colleagues was also in the kitchen and saw the whole thing. 'She must have felt sorry for me because she kindly lent me her jumper so I could tie it around my waist to cover it up. That was the moment I knew I has to do something about my weight.' The road to losing weight has been a difficult one for Gillian, and it has taken almost four years to shift the pounds . Gillian, from Langlees near Falkirk, in Stirlingshire, who once weighed in at more than 13-and-a-half stone, started weight-loss program All About Weight in August 2009, and recorded a 5lb weight loss at her first weigh in.

She said: 'I used to skip breakfast because I had to leave home at either 5.30 or 6.00am to travel to work in Glasgow. 'When I arrived I'd get a blueberry muffin and hot chocolate almost every day, and it quickly became a habit, just like having snacks with the kids at nursery in the afternoon. 'Most lunchtimes I would pay the local chip shop a visit and have a ready meal in the evening, simply for convenience.'

A Labour council is using the sound of a baby choking to death in a house fire to campaign against government cuts. Lambeth Council has also mocked up a newspaper frontpage reporting the entirely fictitious death of five children in a school in a taxpayer-funded campaign against changes to local fire services. The extraordinary marketing campaign, which includes a video of a baby choked by smoke, has been condemned as ‘beyond tasteless’ and ‘downright sick’. Scroll down for video . Baby: Labour-run Lambeth council has produced a video which portrays a child's bedroom filling with smoke . Row: As the clock ticks the coughing suddenly stops and the toy falls on the floor, as the council warns cuts to the fire service will endanger public safety . The sickening propaganda has been produced by the council in south London to oppose plans by the capital’s mayor Boris Johnson to shut Clapham fire station. A YouTube video features a collection of children’s toys on a bookcase as the room gradually fills with smoke. In the background a young child can be heard coughing, with the choking sound getting worse as the smoke appears to thicken. A caption reads: ‘The Mayor of London wants to close Clapham Fire Station. This will add 34 seconds to the average response time for firefighters to reach emergencies in Lambeth.’ A timer starts counting in the corner and when it reaches 13 seconds a toy rabbit falls off the bookcase and the child’s coughing suddenly stops. The council has also produced a shocking mock newspaper front page with the headline: ‘Five children dead in school fire.’ It also refers to 'tragedy in Clapham' and quotes: ‘""Every minute counts” says distraught headteacher’. Other fictional newspapers report 'Blaze at old folks home kills 3' and 'Fire wrecks Clapham businesses. Pressure: London Mayor Boris Johnson has been targeted in the campaign against cuts to the London Fire Service . The 'story' reports that the 'community is in mourning for five children who lost their lives to smoke inhalation after becoming trapped in a horrific fire at a school'. But none of this happened, and is part of what the council calls 'the headlines we don’t want to see'. The poster was used at a public meeting on Monday where up to 90 people were urged to contact a consultation against the closure. The Conservatives today condemned the scare tactics in the strongest possible terms. Bob . Neill, Tory party vice-chairman, said: ‘Lambeth council have a bad . track record for using council taxpayers money to promote political . scare stories, but this is plumbing new depths. Tasteless: This dramatic - but fictional - newspaper front page has been produced by Lambeth council . ‘To conjure up the idea of the death of children in this way is beyond scaremongering and beyond tasteless. It is downright sick.’ But Lambeth council was unrepentant, insisting the cuts posed a ‘very real danger to the public’ The London Fire Authority, which is headed by the London Mayor, wants to close 12 fire stations across the capital. James Cleverly, chairman of the authority said: 'I completely understand people are concerned,but the Council’s attempts to generate fear amongst its residents are disgusting. 'These posters are an ill-judged and irresponsible addition to a Lambeth campaign already marred by emotive misinformation. 'LFEPA and the Mayor will listen closely to the views of residents before any final decisions are made.' Lambeth council says more than 5,500 residents have signed an online petition against the plan to close Clapham Fire station, which serves an area where 16,000 new homes are planned. Councillor Lib Peck, leader of Lambeth council, said: ‘On Monday night at a packed meeting in Clapham, a firefighter said increased response times will cost lives. ‘No other area of London will suffer more than Lambeth from these proposals which will see the time it takes for a fire engine to reach an emergency rise by four minutes in Clapham, compared to an extra 16 seconds across London. 'The posters and film reflect the very real danger to the public of closing Clapham fire station. We believe it's important that our residents are aware of the proposal to close Clapham fire station and the dangers to public safety as a result of increased response times.’ In April it emerged Lambeth council spent hundreds of pounds of taxpayers’ money on 50 posters and an online advert opposing Coalition cuts in welfare. The advert, displayed on Lambeth’s website, featured a giant pair of scissors slicing through a pound sign. It read: ‘The government are making cuts to benefits. If you claim benefits, it is likely you will receive less and may have to find work or move to a different property.’ It then encouraged claimants to contact the town hall’s benefits support team who ‘can help make sure you are getting all you are allowed to claim’. The Tories reported the council to the local government ombudsman for the abuse of taxpayers’ money.","Lambeth Council condemned for tasteless scaremongering .

Prince Charles, whose Duchy of Cornwall includes Tresco, is supporting the plan to give the endangered animals a safe haven. The scheme was suggested by former BBC presenter Robin Page, who said the small island – just two miles long by a mile wide – was an ideal location for a new population of reds. Starting afresh: Five red squirrels, stock image above, have been flown to the Scilly Isles to start a new colony . Former BBC presenter Robin Page, left, recommended the island as a good location for a new red squirrel colony and Prince Charles, whose Duchy of Cornwall includes Tresco, has given his support to the plan . ‘With no grey squirrel population there, the reds won’t be in any danger,’ said Mr Page. ‘And if the new arrivals are a success and a colony becomes established, we can take squirrels from there to form colonies on the mainland when the conditions are right. We’re hoping that if this experiment on Tresco goes well, it will encourage other islands and remote places to follow suit.’ As patron of the Red Squirrel Survival Trust, Prince Charles has warned that Britain’s native red squirrel population could soon be wiped out by aggressive, disease-ridden greys. He said last year: ‘The battle for the red squirrel is iconic. ‘The grey has to be one of the most disastrous introductions  of foreign species there has  ever been. I believe the red should become a national mascot.’ There are up to three million grey squirrels in the UK but only 120,000 reds, which experts fear could become extinct within 20 years. The reds have been ravaged by the squirrel-pox virus carried by 60 per cent of greys, which were imported from America in the 1870s. Tresco’s new reds – including a solitary female – will spend the winter in a cage to acclimatise to their new surroundings.

With his prim manner and somewhat geeky image, Michael Gove may seem an unlikely candidate for eyebrow-raising student antics such as tussles with a love rival and ‘a five-in-a-bed romp shocker’. Reports from a student newspaper give an extraordinary insight into the Scots minister’s colourful past at Oxford in the 1980s, where he studied English and became president of the Union. One report in the Cherwell newspaper, bearing the lurid headline ‘Union hacks in five-in-a-bed romp shocker’, claimed Mr Gove and two other male students ended up in bed with two women after a ball. Colourful antics: Michael Gove with his parents Christine and Ernest before he started university at Oxford . ‘Since the evening in question there have been many tight-lipped “no comments” about what they all got up to,’ the newspaper said in a 1988 report. Mr Gove, who was born in Edinburgh and raised in Aberdeen, apparently said he was ‘only seeking comfort after being beaten up in Aberdeen on Boxing Day’. In another account, Mr Gove, who declined to comment on the reports, is said to have been so overcome by envy towards a love rival he rubbed egg into his hair. Cherwell referred to Mr Gove’s ‘current macho behaviour’ as he attempted to win back the love of Marianne Gilchrist, who apparently called off their romance as his term as president ended and turned to a second suitor, Duncan Penny. The paper reported: ‘At a showdown on Friday, Gove’s jealousy got the better of him and he scrambled egg all over Penny’s hair. ‘He [Penny] managed to respond by reaching for his fridge and splattering the Honourable Gentleman with a tomato.’ Education Secretary: Michael Gove may seem an unlikely candidate for eyebrow-raising student antics such as tussles with a love rival and 'a five-in-a-bed romp shocker', but reports gave an insight into his colourful past . But the row didn’t end there, said the report. ‘In a fit of Hulkman rage Gove broke into Penny’s room at two in the morning and fire-hosed his sleeping body. Unfortunately Gove somehow was unable to hit the mark and Penny wasn’t aroused...’ Another Cherwell article notes that, while standing for election at the Oxford Union, Mr Gove took to wearing a kilt ‘in a desperate attempt to win the sympathy vote’. ‘But does he wear it like a true Scotsman?... the answer seems to be that Michael leaves his boxer shorts at home.’ The tales were reported in the Sunday Times following revelations last week that Dominic Grieve,  the Attorney General, was part of a gang which threw Damian Green – now the police minister – into the Cherwell River. Mr Green reportedly said he ‘could have drowned’ after almost being impaled on rusty spikes in the river.","'Michael Gove and two other male students went to bed with two women'

"By . Meghan Keneally . UPDATED: . 16:07 EST, 30 January 2012 . Facebook is due to become a publicly traded company on Wednesday when it will launch with an expected $100billion valuation, but one man in Mark Zuckerberg's social network won't be celebrating to the same extent. Joe Green is the former college roommate of Mr Zuckerberg who, unlike his famous friend, decided to stay enrolled in Harvard instead of dropping out to make Facebook. That decision is called his $400million mistake. Even in spite of the mistake, Mr Green now runs a charitable giving site called Causes and through that as well as the shares of Facebook which . he owns, he will still likely make a multi-million dollar profit . from the company's expected launch. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Mr Green (left) decided to stay in school and not become one of the founders of Facebook with Mr Zuckerberg (right) 'My father, who's a professor, was not too happy with the prospect of me getting kicked out of school,' Mr Green told Good Morning America. Instead of going on to launch the world's biggest social network, Mr Green graduated and went to work for John Kerry's 2004 presidential campaign, and is now running an online charitable giving service that is one of Facebook's largest applications. Though he wasn't one of the original founders of Facebook in full, Mr Green was a part of the company's original iteration and helped Mr Zuckerberg create the website's predecessor. The college boys first made a site called 'FaceMash' which allowed visitors to judge the looks of people online. After getting in some trouble with Harvard over the project- which involved them hacking into the university's online picture library of students- Mr Green was hesitant to get involved with another internet start-up at the risk of threatening his college education. 'We'd gotten into a little bit of trouble with the previous project,' Mr Green said. College days: Mr Zuckerberg (far left) and Mr Green (far right) are now back working together, though in an extended way as Mr Green runs one of Facebook's largest applications. The two friends in the center are unidentified. Friends in the background: The 2010 film The Social Network chronicled the creation of Facebook, and did not have a character that was meant to be Mr Green but rather he was likely one of the unnamed friends seen in the background . Earning the degree: Mr Green decided to stay at Harvard and graduate instead of quitting early to help Mr Zuckerberg launch Facebook in 2004 . Public service and political organizing were two of Mr Green's passions since a young age, and he was active in the local government of Santa Monica, California, where he grew up. After college, he worked in the . field, getting out the vote for Democrat John Kerry's doomed . presidential campaign, but that did not leave him disheartened. 'That experience made me believe in democracy,' he told The Los Angeles Times. Even though he didn't move out to . California with Mr Zuckerberg and crew immediately, he did make the jump . to San Francisco when he created a site called Essembly in 2005. Politically active: Mr Green posted photos of him with both President Obama (who was campaigning at the time) and former President George HW Bush and former first lady Barbara Bush (right) Done well: Mr Green has quite the view out of his Berkeley, California home overlooking the San Francisco Bay . Splashing out: Mr Green bought a Volvo C70 hardtop convertible just months before launching Causes . He then partnered up with Mr Zuckerberg's friend Sean Parker,  the man known for creating the music . sharing site Napster (and telling Mr Zuckerberg to 'drop the The' which . used to be at the beginning of the social network site's name). The duo set up so-called shop in a popular Hollywood coffeeshop (where celebrity blogger Perez Hilton worked at the time) and started creating the charitable giving site now called Causes. In 2007 he partnered up with Sean . Parker, the man known for creating the music sharing site Napster (and . telling Mr Zuckerberg to 'drop the The' which used to be at the . beginning of the social network site's name), to create his new project . called Causes. Causes helps introduce people to different charitable effort or political issues and does so using Facebook. Thriving on his own: Joe Green now runs a charitable giving site, which is one of Facebook's top apps . While his tech friends were clearly helpful in the beginning, Mr Green has made a name for himself and was recently deemed one of Forbes Magazines' Top 30 Under 30. Causes is one of Facebook's biggest applications and has 170 million users who have raised over $50million for their efforts. Facebook's expected $100billion . valuation when their Initial Public Offering is launched, Mr Zuckerberg . will likely be adding many billions to his current net worth of . $17.5billion. While Mr Green may not have the same exorbitant pay day as his former roommate, he will be fine: he was sure to get a hefty amount of Facebook stock. Facebook's launch as a publicly traded company is expected to happen on Wednesday after months of speculation. In what would be the most hotly anticipated consumer technology offering for more than a decade, Facebook could start the process for an initial public offering of stock as early as Wednesday. The social networking site - which is expected to hit one billion users this year - would join McDonald's, Amazon.com, Visa and Bank of America Corp in the top ranks of the largest public companies in the world. The sale could raise as much as $10 billion (£6.4 billion) in an offering that would value the company at $75 billion to $100 billion (£48 billion to £64 billion), according to the Wall Street Journal. The windfall would dwarf the $1.67 billion (£1 billion) raised in Google's 2004 float. That offering gave Google a market value of $23 billion (£15 billion) - but the company is now worth $184 billion (£117 billion). The sale could be a boon for Facebook's employees too - Mr Zuckerberg suggested in an interview last year that if his company went public it would be possible to reward staff with 'equity and options'. Up to one third of Facebook's 3,000 staff could become millionaires. Mark Zuckerberg: . Age: 27 . Net worth: $17.5billionOwns 24 per cent of Facebook, previously worth $5.3billion .

He has spent more than a week in the public gallery with his wife Julie, Forrest's mother, and daughter Carrie, Forrest's older sister. His son, 30, is accused of abducting a schoolgirl and going on the run in France for eight days. Forrest denies the charge. Trial: As Jeremy Forrest's trial came towards its end today, his father Jim (right, today) has collapsed at court . Aid: Jim Forrest is helped into an ambulance outside Lewes Crown Court, East Sussex after he collapsed . Swept away: The ambulance then left quickly for the local hospital with Mr Forrest safely inside . His trial at Lewes Crown Court has heard that the pupil was 15 when she started a sexual relationship with Forrest after developing a crush on him at Bishop Bell C of E School in Eastbourne, East Sussex. Fearing they were about to be exposed, Forrest booked them on a cross-Channel ferry from Dover to Calais on September 20 before spending seven days on the run in France. Richard Barton, prosecuting, said Forrest's actions were an abuse of trust and he had not acted with the consent of the girl's parents. Case: Jim Forrest looked well when he arrived at Lewes Crown Court (pictured) today, but collapsed shortly afterwards . He added that Forrest could be labelled a paedophile who groomed the vulnerable teenager. Ronald Jaffa, defending, said the teenager was 'desperate and suicidal' and Forrest went with her to prevent her coming to harm.

As a fashion brand it loves to court controversy, placing bare chested male assistants outside stores to lure in customers. But the popular American label Abercrombie and Fitch is now facing a backlash after its chief executive declared its clothes were only for the 'thin and cool'. Some of Hollywood's most glamorous stars are supporting a boycott of the fashion retailer after they were accused of discriminating against overweight customers. Scroll down for video . Kirstie Alley (left) said she will support a . boycott and singer and actress Miley Cyrus vowed to burn her collection . of A&F clothes . Pop idol Miley Cyrus vowed to burn her collection of A&F clothes, while other celebrities including chat show how Ellen DeGeneres and former Cheers star Kirstie Alley said they will support a boycott. The backlash began last month after it was revealed the company's stores worldwide do not stock clothes for plus sized women. The largest size available at the company's 1,000 stores was a size 14 - size 16 in the UK' flagship store in Saville Row, London. As protesters in the U.S. accused the company of discrimination an old interview by its chief executive Mark Jeffries further fuelled the controversy. In the 2006 interview he said: 'In every school, there are the cool and popular kids, and then there are the not-so-cool kids. Candidly, we go after the cool kids. 'We go after the attractive all-American kid with a great attitude and a lot of friends. A lot of people don't belong (in our clothes), and they can't belong.' 'Cool kids': Abercrombie and Fitch CEO Mike Jeffries said in 2006 that a lot of people 'don't belong' in the retailer's clothes - they're only for 'cool kids' Jeffries swiftly apologised for his remarks saying they had been taken out of context. But as the row died down he provoked fresh outrage when he said the chain's clothes were for a 'particular segment' of 'aspirational' young people. Abercrombie stores across the U.S. saw demonstrations from members of the public, while a Los Angeles filmmaker became an internet hit with a film showing the stores clothes being handed out to homeless people as part of a 'brand readjustment'. The company attempted to ride out the nightmare PR by announcing the support of anti-bullying measures. But now with celebrities calling for a boycott many business analysts fear the brand will be further damaged. Chat show host Ellen DeGeneres mocked the firm by pretending some tiny doll clothes were its 'double zero' size. She warned her 4million viewers that the T-shirt might shrink in the wash. Kirstie Alley, the former Cheers actress who has struggled publicly with her weight, said she was banning her two children from shopping at the chain. In an open letter to Jeffries, she tweeted: 'You are not cute and your head is huge... you need to stop wearing A&F clothing.' Miley Cyrus, who has millions of fans, said she was going to burn her A&F clothes as they were 'stinking up my place.' Even before the controversy sales at the 121 year old fashion label had plunged by 17 per cent. Last year the company had sales of over £2.1billion. In the past they have been accused been sued for discriminating against ethnic groups and choosing only 'attractive' sales assistants. Last year it emerged that employees had to carry out physical exercises while at work to maintain the 'thin and beautiful' look. According to a company email, male employees at the retailer's Milan flagship in Italy had to carry out 10 push-ups, while women who failed to measure up were given ten squats. Two years ago the retailer sparked outrage by banning shop assistant Harriet Phipps, 18, from wearing a poppy at work in Southampton. She was told it was 'not part of her uniform'. The store later changed its policy. In 2009 Abercrombie & Fitch had to pay an employee with a prosthetic arm £8,000 for unlawful harassment. Riam Dean, 22, said she was made to work in the stockroom at a central London store because she did not fit in with the company's image.","Some of Hollywood's most glamorous stars are supporting a boycott .

Facebook has hiked up the size of its initial public offering by almost 25 per cent, making the social media site worth an estimated $104billion. With that estimate, Facebook becomes more valuable than brands that have been cemented in America’s culture for decades – including Kraft, McDonald's, and even Disney. A single share for the eight-year old company is expected to open at $38, helping disprove naysayers’ warnings of the site’s long-term potential, even as General Motors pulled their advertisements. Reason to smile: Facebook, created by Mark Zuckerberg some eight years ago, has hiked up the size of its initial public offering by almost 25 per cent . Not lovin' it: Facebook could surpass other global brands like McDonald's, left, and Disney, right . The U.S. automaker confirmed a report by the Wall Street Journal today. GM's marketing executives decided Facebook's ads had little impact on consumers. GM said it will still have Facebook pages marketing its vehicles, but it will drop use of paid ads. Anyone can create a Facebook page at no cost. It is crucial for Facebook's future that the rest of the auto industry continues to buy adverts on the site. The Journal notes that it spends the most advertising dollars in the U.S. - last year alone, the industry spent $13.89billion on advertisements. 'We regularly review our overall media spend and make adjustments as needed...it's not unusual for us to move our spending around various media outlets - especially with the growth of multiple social and digital media outlets,' GM said in a statement. GM spends about $40 million on its Facebook presence, but only about $10 million of that is paid to Facebook for advertising. The rest covers the creation of content and the agencies involved, The Journal said. Facebook, the company founded eight years ago by Mark Zuckerberg in a Harvard dorm room, said on Wednesday it will add about 84 million shares to its IPO, floating about 421 million shares in an offering expected to be priced on Thursday. Out: GM said that Facebook ads don't pay off and withdrew their advertising ahead of the social media company's IPO . Facebook fever: Facebook says 25 per cent more shares will be sold as investors clamor for a piece of the year's hottest stock offering on Nasdaq . Invested: An investor holds literature explaining the Facebook stock after attending a show for Facebook Inc's IPO earlier this month . The additional shares will be sold by early investors including PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, Accel Partners' James Breyer and investment manager Tiger Global Management, the company said in a filing. The company itself has not increased the number of shares it will sell. Zuckerberg's voting power will be reduced to about 55.8 per cent from about 57.3 per cent after the IPO as a result of the issue of additional shares, the company said. The expanded size, coupled with Facebook's recently announced plans to raise the IPO price range, would make Facebook the third-largest initial share sale in U.S. history after Visa Inc and General Motors. The social networking company is drumming up massive demand for the offering even as slowing revenue and user growth spur questions about the long-term Facebook story. Those concerns over revenue growth were underscored on Tuesday, when GM said it planned to pull out of advertising on Facebook. Business as usual: Workers continue their daily tasks at the Facebook office in Menlo Park, California ahead of the IPO . Thanks: Facebook released a picture of some staff thanking users for their support ahead of its $5billion initial public offering. But some users don't think that is enough thanks and they want a cut of the money . 'This is much more a spectacle, a media event and a cultural moment than it is an IPO,' said Max Wolff, an analyst at GreenCrest Capital. 'This is not a game of models and fundamentals at this point.' GM's announcement, while ill-timed for Facebook, should not seriously hurt the IPO's reception for now as it may not be representative of advertisers' overall attitude, said Brian Wieser, an analyst with Pivotal Research Group. Among the soon-to-be Facebook millionaires and billionaires is graffiti artist David Choe, who was commissioned to paint murals in the Palo Alto Facebook office. Rather than receive payment, he chose to receive shares of the company’s stock. He stands to earn around $200million. Likewise, Bono, the front man of U2 and activist could earn up to $1.5billion. In February, Business Insider estimated that Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, who is the company's highest-paid employee, could earn as much as $1.25billion. The housing market in Silicon Valley is booming as well, as it anticipates a whole new level of affluent young workers hoping to snatch up a luxurious home. 'The demand for the IPO probably won't be affected materially by this,' he said, adding, however, there were probably a lot of calls between underwriters and investors following GM's announcement. The IPO, Silicon Valley's largest, eclipses the roughly $2 billion debut by Google Inc in 2004. The price range hike, coupled with strong results from internet and social media players Groupon and China's Renren Inc, contributed to a dotcom rally on Wall Street on Tuesday. Shares of Pandora Media Inc rose 10.3 per cent, Zynga Inc was up 7.7 per cent, Groupon climbed 3.7 per cent and Renren gained 6.4 per cent, Reuters reported. Before the IPO size was increased, Facebook would have raised about $12.1 billion based on the midpoint price of $36 and the 337.4 million shares on offer originally. At this midpoint, Facebook would be valued at roughly 27 times its 2011 revenue, or 99 times earnings. Google went public at a valuation of $23 billion, or 16 times its trailing revenue and 218 times earnings. Apple Inc went public in 1980 at a valuation of 25 times its revenue and 102 times earnings. Facebook's IPO comes as some investors worry the company has not yet figured out a way to make money from a growing number of users who access the social network on mobile devices such as smartphones. Meanwhile, revenue growth from Facebook's online advertising business, which accounts for the bulk of its revenue, has slowed in recent months. With some 900 million users, it had $1 billion in net income on revenue of $3.7 billion in 2011.The company has also extended the time frame for its $1 billion acquisition of mobile app maker Instagram, projecting the deal would close this year instead of the second quarter as it previously indicated. It provided no reasons, though a source familiar with the matter told Reuters last week that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission has reached out to Google and Twitter as part of the agency's standard review for deals of that size. Facebook is scheduled to begin trading on the Nasdaq on Friday. A host of Wall Street banks are underwriting the offering, with Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs serving as leads.

TV presenter Jenny Hanley has revealed she was hit by a series  of mini-strokes as she organised a memorial service for her mother,  the actress Dinah Sheridan. The former star of children’s TV show Magpie, who also appeared as a Bond girl in On Her Majesty’s Secret Service, said she is lucky to be alive after she ignored bouts of going blind and paralysis in one arm. She now realises it was ‘heavily against the odds’ that she made it to her mother’s memorial service in April.

Fletcher, pictured, was sentenced to 15 years and eight months on an unrelated charge of sexual exploitation of a minor last week but the judge said evidence showed he was involved in the killing of Mary 'Pat' O'Hagan . A 26-year-old Vermont man has avoided a murder charge despite having confessed to helping kill a 78-year-old grandmother and a judge claiming there was enough evidence to show he at least cleaned up after the slaying and dumped the body. Richard E. Fletcher was sentenced to 15 years and eight months on an unrelated charge of sexual exploitation of a minor last week, but the entire trial focused on the death of Mary 'Pat' O'Hagan. Judge Christina Reiss said she considered allegations that the defendant participated in the killing of O'Hagan in 2010 and imposed a sentence that was eight months more than the minimum sentence. 'Obviously, we think our mother's worth more than eight months,' Matt O'Hagan, one of O'Hagan's five children, told the Burlington Free Press after the hearing, adding that the family was appalled by the outcome. 'We certainly aren't happy.' No one has been charged in connection with the death of the grandmother-of-nine, who disappeared from her home in September 2010 only to be found dead three weeks later by duck hunters in nearby Wheelock. However, police claim Fletcher, his brother Keith J. Baird, 32, and Fletcher’s cousin Michael Norrie, 22, who are all in custody on various unrelated charges, are responsible for the slaying after an ill-fated robbery attempt. State prosecutors have previously said they lack evidence to prove murder charges against the three men, despite having confessions. Appalled: Mark O'Hagan, the youngest child of Pat O'Hagan pictured right in 2010, was appalled that no one has been charged in the death of his mother, pictured left . Suspect: Michael Norrie, who police say was also involved in the murder, is seen in court in St. Johnsbury, Vermont in 2011 . On Tuesday, one of duck hunters who found O'Hagan's body, former correctional officer Jordan Owens, testified that Fletcher confessed to being involved in her murder in 2011 while at a prison in St. Johnsbury. 'He told me that when he closed his eyes, he would see the image of Pat O'Hagan, and that she was haunting him,' Owens said in court on Tuesday, according to the Free Press. After two days of testimony, Reiss determined the evidence showed that Fletcher helped clean up after the killing at O'Hagan's home in Sheffield and helped dispose of O'Hagan's body in Wheelock. She said there wasn't enough evidence to prove Fletcher shot and killed O'Hagan. Reiss said it was 'highly unusual' for a judge to consider an 'unrelated, uncharged state crime' in the sentencing of another crime.","Richard E. Fletcher was sentenced to 15 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 18:10 EST, 6 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:19 EST, 7 June 2013 . Our understanding of what lies underneath the world's biggest ice sheet has just grown exponentially. Scientists at NASA have used decades of research and data from the British Antarctic Survey, images from the Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite plus results from years of flyovers by specialized aircraft  measuring changes in the thickness of sea ice, glaciers, and ice sheets,  to create the most detailed rendering of the earth's surface beneath the ice of Antarctica ever. The new model, Bedmap2, is an update of Bedmap, which was made more than 10 years ago. The new images are a significant improvement on the previous map, containing 25 million additional data points and surface and sub-ice features that were too small to be seen in the previous data-set. Scroll down for video . What lies beneath: This image is part of Bedmap2, and shows the surface of the earth in Antarctica without its usual coating of ice and snow . The new map of the ice-covered landmass is important for scientists studying the effects of climate change because Antarctica plays a pivotal role within the global climate system, affecting ocean currents and raising sea levels. Its influence will increase as the globe continues to warm. Researchers previously used a variety of methods to attempt to predict how Antarctica will react to a changing climate, but the limited information about the depth of the ice and the surface of the bedrock made it imprecise. Remote: It's no wonder people have never seen what the surface of the earth beneath Antarctica's snow looks like - in some places, the ice is three kilometres thick . Now with Bedmap2, researchers can use the detailed map and its new data on average bedrock depth, deepest point and ice thickness to more accurately predict how the continent will react to future climactic conditions. From a distance: The Antarctic ice sheet covers 98 per cent of the continent and contains more than half of the world's fresh water . The more accurate the map, the better . scientists can understand the impact that melting ice from Antarctica . will have on the rest of the planet. Antarctica’s ice isn't static but constantly flows outwards. Version 2.0: Bedmap2, seen here contrasted with Bedmap which was created in 2001, has 25 million measurements more than its predecessor . 'Ice sheets grow because of snow, and like honey poured on a plate, spread outward and thin due to their own weight,' Sophie Nowicki, an ice sheet scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, told NASA.gov. Knowing the shape of the bedrock beneath the ice and the thickness . of the ice itself allows scientists to simulate the movements of the ice . and predict how it will move in the future. 'It will be an important resource for the next generation of ice sheet modelers, physical oceanographers and structural geologists,' said Peter Fretwell, British Antarctic Survey scientist and lead author of the project.","Using decades of research, scientists at NASA have created the most accurate map of Antarctica's landscape ever .

A New York City police dog is nursing four broken teeth and a cut tongue after he was kicked in the face by a woman brawling in a subway station. The incident happened when NYPD officer Vincent Tieniber and his German Shepherd Bear were trying to break up a fight at the number 4 train in the 59th Street and Lexington Avenue station. Police said a 19-year-old woman was being choked by another woman the same age at around 11:15 a.m. on Tuesday. Officer Rafael Diaz was the first on the scene but had to call for back up when Ravenia Matos-Davis, 22, and a 31-year-old woman pushed him after he tried to stop the choking. Brave buddies: Police Officer Vincent Tieniber poses with his partner, Bear, in New York in this undated photo . That's when Tieniber and Bear arrived. As Tieniber went to handcuff Matos-Davis, the Queens woman lunged at six-year-old Bear, who is part of the Transit Bureau K-9 unit. She struck the animal twice, resulting in multiple cracked teeth and lacerations on his tongue. However, probably due to his police training, Bear was quick to react. 'Bear kept the woman's foot in his mouth, and held on until I could handcuff her,' officer Tieniber said in a release. Tieniber himself suffered a sprained wrist while trying to arrest Matos-Davis. The dog was taken to Animal Medical Center on East 62nd Street where he was treated and released later in the day.

Bear has been on the job for five years, in which time he and Tieniber, who has been on the force for 11 years, have been praised for many a brave arrest. Matos-Davis was charged with injuring a police animal, disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, and obstructing governmental administration. Police said attacking or killing a police animal is currently only a Class A misdemeanor, however legislation is pending to make it a Class E felony. Alexandria James, 19, of the Bronx was charged with strangulation and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fight while Tabricia Moore, 31, also of the Bronx, was charged with obstructing governmental administration, resisting arrest and disorderly conduct, police said. The woman James allegedly attacked suffered bruises, scratches and neck pain, but wouldn't go to the hospital, according to police.","Six-year-old German Shepherd Bear was kicked in the face by Ravenia Matos-Davis, 22, who was fighting in the subway .

"By . Petronella Wyatt . PUBLISHED: . 16:15 EST, 12 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:15 EST, 12 June 2013 . This is it - the end. I imagine the scissors, now mere centimetres from my neck, making a sound like the rush of a guillotine blade. For I am about to lose, if not my head, then the signature style that has defined me for the past 15 years. My shoulder-length, honey-coloured tresses. My pride and joy. 'Stop!' I squeal. The long and short of it: An initially dubious Petronella now loves her pixie cut . But it is too late. My life in hair flashes before my eyes: how I used to stroke it like a beloved pet when I was 13 and it had finally grown enough for me to tease it into a pinned-up style; how I loved using hot rollers when I was 17 in an attempt to look like American actress Veronica Lake. So when I eventually look down and see my luscious locks on the floor, I think for one crazy moment something inside me has been murdered. 'It's better to get it over with quickly,' says Tess Boyle, my brilliant hairdresser from the Jo Hansford salon in Mayfair, London. I've long been visiting Tess for haircuts, and the Duchess of Cornwall and Liz Hurley get their coiffures tended to here, too. But neither of them have done anything so drastic as to have the Anne Hathaway pixie crop. So what on earth possessed me? Well, it wasn't fashion, despite the popularity of actress Anne Hathaway's crop, which she had done for her role in the film Les Miserables. No, my decision was based on crude practicalities. For a start, my hair makes me late. On a holiday to Jamaica, where the climate is devastating to long, frizzy hair like mine, I struggled with a hairdryer, hot irons and a heap of products to tame it into a semblance of a style every evening. 'Have you never thought of cutting your hair?' asked my travelling companion, who'd just waited an hour for me to turn up for dinner. Top of the crops: Anne Hathaway's pixie crop has become one of the top ten most copied celebrity hairstyles . I knew she was joking. But before I'd left London, a male friend said: 'I like you best with you hair tied back, like a boy.' I had been mildly annoyed; now I wondered if he actually had a point. So when I returned to London, I confessed to a couple of friends that I was thinking of cutting it all off. They told me to go for it - after four glasses of wine. That's when I broke the first rule of tonsorial decision-making: never text your hairdresser when drunk. The next morning I find myself, sweating, having a 'consultation' with Tess. 'Right,' she says. 'I was thinking Anne Hathaway. Definitely Anne Hathaway.' Tess has been cutting my hair for 15 years and has been itching to chop it short for ages. But a pixie crop? Firstly, I worry that I'll look more gruesome than gamine. My bone structure is good, but it's not classical like Hathaway's. My nose has a bump in the middle - will such an unforgiving cut accentuate it? Secondly, I worry I'll lose my sex appeal. Don't men love long, tangled hair that they can use to drag you back to their caves? In the Middle Ages, English queens, no matter what they really looked like, were automatically endowed by painters and poets with very long, fair hair. The length indicated fertility and the light colour virtue. I had the length and the colour if not the virtue. So why did I want to lose those as well? Tess ignores my tortured bleating and says she believes long hair is not the most flattering style for women over 35. She says it pulls down the face, making it appear older. Short hair will 'take years off you'. Tess doesn't even wash my hair before she begins to chop - apparently that gives people too much time to change their mind when going for something this drastic. 'I feel the back of my neck: there is . nothing there. I recall Ronald Reagan's line in the 1942 film King's . Row. He finds out both his legs have been amputated and duly cries: ""Where's the rest of me?""' She turns my chair away from the mirror. 'No peeking till it's ready,' she says, clearly worried I might faint from shock. Then I am shampooed and my hair combed, parted and cropped with a small blade that brushes the back of my neck. I feel the back of my neck: there is nothing there. I recall Ronald Reagan's line in the 1942 film King's Row. He finds out both his legs have been amputated and duly cries: 'Where's the rest of me?' Tess begins to blowdry what's left of me. It takes three minutes. It used to take me at least 25. By this time I'm almost sobbing. I realise that such a drastic change in hairstyle will require a whole new way of life. During the day, I almost never wear make-up because I can hide behind my hair. If my eyes are puffy, I simply shake some tendrils over them. If I get a spot on my forehead, I'll artfully pin my hair to cover it. Now I'll need to wear lots of make-up at all times. I'll need a new wardrobe, too. With a pixie crop, pared-down elegance is crucial. Think Fifties-style silk Capri pants and fitted tops. But while I'll save money on all those anti-frizz hair-styling products, my new wardrobe and enhanced make-up collection will cost another £2,000 at least. Oh Lord! 'You can look now,' Tess cries. I do not recognise the face staring back at me. My nose seems longer and larger. For one awful moment, I think I look like Anne Robinson. On the plus side, my eyes appear bigger and my cheekbones higher. In fact, I haven't seen my cheekbones for years - they were always hidden by hair. 'Hello cheekbones,' I say feebly trying to seem happier than I am. I go to the bathroom and apply thick black eyeliner in a vain imitation of Audrey Hepburn. When I add a slick of lipstick, I do feel a little better. While I look nothing like Anne Hathaway, I do look younger by at least five years. Meanwhile, Tess is ecstatic. 'It's wonderful!' she gushes, 'It really suits you.' My mother's reaction is surprisingly enthusiastic, too. 'That's nice, darling. I never noticed what a long neck you had before.' Cute cut: Getting the chop can be nerve-wracking, but ultimately refreshing . Still, I go out food shopping in dark glasses and a cap. No one recognises me, not even the butcher I owe money to. The following morning I have a coffee appointment with an old male friend. He screams. 'When did you do that?' The blood in my veins turns cold. 'It's fabulous. It's taken years off you,' he continues. My spirits begin to rise. Another friend says I look 'fresher'. Then I test it on a date with a man I've been seeing for a while. Nervously, I put on lashings of black eyeliner and flick my hair up at the ends. Even with the agonising about clothes and make-up, it takes me only 15 minutes to get ready. Gone is the need for backcombing, tonging and spraying my hair. When my date sees me, he hollers: 'Hey, you're on time. What happened?' I point to my hair. 'Well it was about time you did something with it. Your hair looked like an unmade bed. Now you look sort of cute.' Cute? I can't help but be thrilled. I haven't been called that since I was 22. Perhaps my pixie cut isn't so hair-raising after all.","Petronella Wyatt's shoulder-length hair do defined her signature style .

An Indiana woman who was sentenced to die at age 16 for the brutal murder of an elderly Bible school teacher will be released from prison on Monday after 28 years behind bars. Paula Cooper was just 15 in May 1985 when she and two other teenage girls entered 78-year-old Ruth Pelke's home in Gary, Indiana, by telling her they wanted to study the scripture. Once inside, they viciously attacked the frail woman. Cooper, now age 43, is being released because the Indiana Supreme Court commuted her sentence to 60 years in prison in 1988. In prison, she received a bachelor's . degree a went on to train companion dogs for the disabled and serve as a . counselor to other inmates at Rockville Correctional Facility - . Indiana's largest women's prison. Child: Paula Cooper was 15 when she brutally killed Ruth Pelke. She was sentenced to die in 1986, at age 16 . Ruth Pelke was a frail, 78-year-old Bible school teacher . Her prison record shows 23 violations, though only minors infractions since 1995 when she was sentenced to solitary confinement for assaulting a guard. She told the Indianapolis Star in a 2004 interview that she feels remorse for the killings. 'Everybody has a responsibility to do . right or wrong, and if you do wrong, you should be punished,' she said. 'Rehabilitation comes from you. If you're not ready to be rehabilitated, . you won't be.' Bill Pelke, Ruth Pelke's grandson, . said he has befriended Cooper in the nearly three decades she has . been in prison and forgives her for her crime. 'My main concern is seeing her get settled and find a job,' he told the Star. The crime horrified Indiana. Cooper admitted to the murder, but prosecutors pushed for the death penalty, arguing the crime was unspeakably vicious and pre-planned. Investigators found she stabbed Pelke 30 times with a . kitchen knife as the elderly woman lay on the floor. One of the thrusts . was so hard, it passed through Pelke's body and damaged the wood . floorboards. In 1986, at age 16, she was sentenced to die by Lake County Judge James Kimbrough. At the time, state law allowed for the execution of anyone age 10 and over who was convicted of capital murder. She was the youngest person on death row in the country. The sentence sparked and uproar from anti-death penalty campaigners around the world. Letters flooded the state General Assembly, the prosecutor's office and the Indiana Supreme Court. Reformed? Cooper, 43, has earned a bachelor's degree behind bars and has not had any major run-ins with prison authorities since 1995 . These undated mug shots of Paula Cooper show the convicted murderer on two separate occasions during her prison sentence . Pope John Paul II himself pleaded for clemency for Cooper and sent an emissary to visit the prosecutors and beg not to condemn the girl. Cooper spent less than two years on death row, by 1988 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled minors couldn't be executed for any crime that happened before age 16. In 2005, a new court ruling raised the age to 18. The Indiana Supreme Court commuted her sentence to 60 years in prison that year. By  2002, the state raised the minimum age for execution to 18.

A woman trying to live on nothing but water for up to six months is calling it quits after 47 days. Naveena Shine, 65, from Redmond, Seattle, stopped eating on May 3 in a bid to explore breatharianism - the concept that food is not necessary and sunlight provides all of the nourishment the body needs. But on Sunday she announced via Facebook and YouTube that she is ending the extreme self-experiment because she has realized that it's 'totally dangerous' and likely to cause death. Scroll down for video . Extreme self-experiment: Naveena Shine seen in the first week of not eating (left) and six weeks later (right) The retiree, originally from the UK, also says that she didn’t want to be responsible for others trying to 'live on light” without having their 'belief systems lined up'. She continued: 'Somebody doing this . without all of that in place is synonymous to watching a tightrope . walker high in the air, admiring them and thinking you can do it too. 'Now that I see all that feedback, I am really seeing that it is totally dangerous' 'If I got up there and tried to copy them, the result would be instant death.' Ms Shine will 'slowly' resume eating on June 19. In 45 days she has lost 20per cent of her body weight, taking her five-foot four-inch frame down from 159 to 126 pounds. Other than water she has also been drinking tea with a 'splash of milk' and recently started taking daily vitamin supplements. Dr Alan D. Lieberson explains in the Scientific American the length of survival without food is influenced by factors such as body weight, other health considerations and, most importantly, the presence or absence of dehydration. Unlike total starvation, near-total starvation with continued hydration has occurred frequently, both in history - during famines, for example - and in patients under medical supervision. A Q&A section on New York's Colombia University website explains that after one day without food, the body will have used up its carbohydrates. After that, it's on to the fat reserves. The average person apparently has enough fat reserves to live for four to six weeks without food. From there the body begins to use its protein reserves - basically, the body itself - which causes irreparable damage to vital organs including the brain. It states that on average people can last for about eight weeks on water alone, give or take about a week for an over or underweight person, respectively. Unpleasant side effects of her . no-food diet have included 'sensations of bile' at the back of her . throat, sickness, nausea and constipation. It also impacted on her social life. On day seven she wrote: 'My friends had a barbeque tonight! I could not . actually smell it but I could hear them all having a good time. They . did send me their love but no steak! 'Food is such a social connection that to give up the addiction to food also requires learning how to interact in a non-food situation. 'Imagine going to a wedding or a party or a buffet and not eating! I don’t even want to think of it!' Confined to the same four walls, Ms Shine has been filling her time with movies, exercise and sleep. In one of her video entries she claimed . she felt 'very well' and only occasionally experienced 'twinges of what . feels like hunger'. However, now she days that negative public reaction has caused her to reconsider what she is doing. 'There are a lot of people who are . genuinely concerned for safety and genuinely don't think it's possible . and believe it to be dangerous,' she said on Sunday. 'Now that I see all that feedback, I am really seeing that it is totally dangerous.' Under surveillance: The retiree installed security cameras around her home to prove she didn't sneak snacks . Doctors have warned that it is not . possible for humans to photosynthesize, and four deaths have been linked . to people who apparently had tried. Too extreme: Ms Shine set out to survive on nothing but water for six months . Another motivating factor for ending the experiment, says Ms Shine, is that she’s out of money. Originally she hoped publicizing her efforts through social media would help keep her financially afloat, but to date she has only received $425 in contributions via her website. For the experiment she maxed out her credit cards buying equipment such as eight security cameras. She had them installed in her small trailer to prove she wasn’t sneaking snacks. The last day she ate solid food was on April 30. She then embarked on a three-day juice cleanse and underwent colonics in preparation for the prolonged fast. As for her first meal, she told The Seattle Times it will consist of ‘lemon juice for vitamin C and a spoonful of maple syrup in warm water for energy’. She will then move on to liquidy vegetables such as spinach or zucchini sautéed in water.' There are thought to be more than 5,000 breatharianists and light nutritionists worldwide.","In 45 days Naveena Sine has lost 20per cent of her body weight, taking her five-foot four-inch frame down from 159 to 126 pounds .

The founder of the iconic Missoni fashion label has died at home aged 92. Ottavio Missoni‘s whose brand was instantly recognisable for its unique zig zag stripes, had recently been hospitalised for heart failure and had resigned as director of the company last year. His death at his home in Italy comes just months after his son's plane disappeared without a trace off the coast of Venezuela. The brand's trademark geometric designs had won it high profile fans including Kate Moss and the Duchess of Cambridge. At its peak in the 1970s Missoni was one of the world’s most influential fashion houses. More recently it has expanded into branded hotels and home collections. Ottavio originally founded the company with his wife Rosita, and the entire family continued to be closely involved in the business, considering themselves craftsmen. He lived in Varese in northern Italy, near the border with Switzerland next to the factory he had built and worked in since 1969. In his youth he was an accomplished athlete in hurdles and 400m and came 6th in in the 1948 Olympics. His original collection was a set of tracksuits for the Italian Olympic team. After meeting his wife they founded a . knitwear label which became Missoni and quickly drew the attention of . legendary Vogue editor Diana Vreeland.

The Missoni family are still hopeful that the pair, who went missing along with friends, Guido Foresti, his wife Elda Scalvenzi, and two Venezuelan pilots, will be found by rescue crews. The BN-2 Islander plane vanished shortly after takeoff on Jan. 4 from Los . Roques, a tiny archipelago that is a dependency of Venezuela. It was . destined for Caracas, the South American nation's capital. In Feburary police on the tiny island . of Bonaire said that two pieces of luggage from a missing plane that . was carrying the CEO of Italian fashion house Missoni has washed up on a . local beach. Italy's . air safety agency has said the pilot of the vanished plane had an . expired medical fitness certificate and that the company operating the . aircraft wasn't yet authorized to fly. However, the National Flight Safety Agency has said that neither factor is being blamed for the disappearance at this time. Seven . minutes after takeoff, the pilot reported that he was at 5,000 feet and . 10 nautical miles from the Los Roques airport, according to the agency.

Snared: Suspected paedophile Walter Lee Williams, 64, who was arrested in Mexico yesterday after he was named one of the FBI's Ten Most Wanted . A former professor at the University of Southern California suspected sexually abusing young boys and producing child pornography was yesterday arrested in Mexico. Walter Lee Williams, 64, was captured yesterday evening while drinking coffee near a park in the beach town of Playa del Carmen, on the country's Carribean coast. He was on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list for charges of sexual exploitation of children and travelling abroad for the purpose of engaging in sexual acts with children. Local prosecutor Gaspar Armando Garcia Torres said it wasn't clear how long Williams had been living in Playa del Carmen. The fugitive also had an address in nearby Cancun, said the prosecutor, where he was taken and turned over to Mexican immigration officials. Mr Garcia did not say whether Williams is suspected of committing any crimes in Mexico. A federal arrest warrant was issued for the former Palm Springs, California, resident in Los Angeles in April, according to the FBI website. The indictment alleges Williams travelled from Los Angeles to the Philippines in January 2011 to engage in sex acts with two 14-year-old boys he met online in 2010, said the U.S. Department of Justice. While in the country he allegedly engaged in sex acts with both boys and produced sexually explicit photos of one of the boys. The paedophile suspect fled the Los Angeles area approximately one week after returning from the Philippines, the DoJ added. Williams was until 2011 a tenured professor studying gender development at the University of Southern California. He was also affiliated with the Buddhist Universal Association of Los Angeles, California, according to the FBI. 'Williams has an extensive history of travel throughout the South East Asia region, specifically the Philippines,' the FBI said. 'He has reportedly resided in Indonesia, Polynesia and Thailand.' The FBI had only added Williams to its Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list on Monday. In a video about Williams posted on the FBI's website to bring attention to the case, Special Agent Jeff Yesenky said: 'I analysed the computers and the camera that belong to Williams and found child pornography.'

Britain has ‘left intensive care’ and its economic recovery means the Government can start to return the taxpayer-owned banks to the private sector, the Chancellor declared last night. A sell-off of Lloyds could begin within months, while Royal Bank of Scotland may be split into two before shares are offered, almost certainly after the next election. George Osborne announced an urgent review of proposals to divide RBS into a ‘good bank’ which can lend more to homebuyers and small firms, and a ‘bad bank’ to isolate its toxic assets.

Preparations: Chancellor George Osborne annotates his speech before addressing the audience . In his annual Mansion House speech in . London last night, he said ‘nothing better signals Britain’s move from . rescue to recovery than the fact we can start to plan for our exit from . government share ownership of our biggest banks’. Gordon Brown pumped £45.5billion of . taxpayers’ money into RBS and £20.5billion into Lloyds as they neared . collapse in 2008 and 2009, leaving the state owning about 80 per cent of . RBS and 40 per cent of Lloyds. The sell-off will be the biggest . privatisation ever seen in Britain. Mr Osborne made clear for the first . time that the Government believes the economy has at last turned the . corner after five years of misery.

The Bank of England should not raise interest rates too quickly, because it could trigger ‘great damage’ to families and businesses, the outgoing governor said last night. In his final speech before retiring next week, Sir Mervyn King (right) warned against ‘a rapid return’ to higher rates. Despite 23 years at the Bank, he admits leaving ‘much unfinished business’, such as a broken banking system and a fragile economy. Base rate was cut to 0.5 per cent in March 2009 – the lowest since the Bank was founded in 1694. Rates have not risen since, rescuing millions of families from disaster by slashing mortgage bills. In his Mansion House speech, Sir Mervyn, who will be made a life peer when he retires, warned: ‘A rapid return to higher interest rates would do great damage to the balance sheets of highly indebted households, companies and, especially, financial institutions.’ There has been fierce debate at the . top of the Government over to what extent ministers should go public . with their increasing optimism. However, he confirmed what Treasury . officials have believed for months – that while there are still risks . ahead, he believes the economy has at last returned to solid if . unspectacular growth. He said: ‘No recovery from such a deep and . damaging global recession is going to be straightforward. ‘But equally, the economic news here . in Britain has been better in recent months. The economy is growing. Record numbers are in work. Surveys of confidence and future activity . are stronger. Let me say tonight: the British economy is healing. ‘But while Britain has left intensive . care, we still need to secure the recovery – and make sure we continue . to treat the ailments that brought us low in the first place.’ Senior Tories believe the . privatisation of the banks will be a moment of huge political . significance as ‘payback time’ from the sector. It could rekindle the . excitement of the ‘Tell Sid’ campaign, in which five million people . bought shares in British Gas. The Chancellor did not set out a timetable, but said the Government is ‘actively considering options for share sales’.

Flies swarm around some of the 10 . animals that have been embalmed so far. The makeshift cages housing the . exhibits — fashioned from fencing salvaged from Jewish settlements that . Israel dismantled in 2005 — are littered with empty soda cans and other . trash. The zoo's 65 live animals, which include ostriches, monkeys, turtles, deer, a llama, a lion and a tiger, don't fare much better. During a recent visit, children poked chocolate, potato chips and bread through the wire. There's no zookeeper on the premises. Gaza has no government body that oversees zoos, and medical treatment is done by consulting over the phone with zoo veterinarians in Egypt. Still, the zoo is one of the few places of entertainment here in Khan Younis, a city of 200,000 people at the southern end of the Gaza Strip. It's one of five zoos in the Gaza Strip, a densely populated coastal enclave of 1.7million people ruled by Islamic Hamas militants. Grim: Palestinian schoolchildren watch zoo owner Mohammed Awaida pet a mummified lion at the zoo, where animals are stuffed and placed back in their enclosures after they die . Emaciated: Children enter the enclosure of a stuffed lion, whose ribs are visible from outside the cage . Owner . Mohammed Awaida said he opened the 'South Forest Park' in 2007, only to . lose a number of animals during Israel's military offensive against . Hamas that began in December 2008. During the three-week offensive, . launched in response to rocket attacks on Israel, Awaida said he could . not reach the zoo, and many animals died of neglect and starvation. 'The . idea to mummify animals started after the Gaza war because a number of . animals like the lion, the tiger, monkeys and crocodiles died,' he said. 'So we asked around and we learned from the Web how to start.' Formaldehyde and sawdust provided the basic tools, though Awaida acknowledges he is no expert. A hole in the porcupine's head is impossible not to notice. Gaza's zoos are used to resorting to odd ways to get by amid the territory's multiple woes. In 2009, a zoo in Gaza City exhibited white donkeys painted with black stripes to look like zebras because it was too expensive to replace two zebras who were neglected during the Israeli offensive. Since Hamas violently took control of Gaza in 2007, Israel has blocked Gaza's ports, waters and all but one border crossing into Israel. Egypt has also restricted movement through its border crossing, meaning new animals must be smuggled at great expense through an elaborate network of underground tunnels on the Gazan-Egyptian border. Swarms: Flies buzz around a tiger that lies frozen inside a nearby cage at the Khan Younis zoo . Attraction: The zoo is one of the few places of entertainment in Khan Younis, a city of 200,000 people . Awaida said all of his animals except the birds came through the tunnels. Preserving dead zoo animals is not new to Palestinians. In the West Bank city of Qalqilya, zoo veterinarian Sami Khader turned to taxidermy nine years ago when a giraffe named Brownie died during the second Palestinian uprising against Israel. Khader, who had extensive training and experience in taxidermy from years working in Saudi Arabia, stuffed Brownie and moved him to the zoo's museum. Today that museum includes a hyena, wolf, birds, camel, raccoons and a tiger. Fighting with Israel has since subsided and the zoo maintains close connections with the Ramat Gan Safari outside Tel Aviv. But administrators say that Israeli restrictions still make it cumbersome to get new animals. 'We have more variations and different species as preserved animals than we have living,' said Amjad al-Haj, the zoo's financial director. 'If there will be more restrictions we may end up calling it preserved animals zoo.' Exhibit: A porcupine is frozen against a wall with pots and other stuffed animals in another display . Conditions in Khan Younis — and its zoo — are far worse. Whereas Khader is a veterinarian and professional taxidermist, Awaida is untrained. 'I use many ingredients for the embalming, not one or two, and the ingredients and method will vary from animal to animal,' Khader said. 'It's not enough to just go read on the Internet.' And Awaida does not have the contacts with Israeli zoos that Qalqilya has, a reflection of Gaza's near-complete separation from Israel. Like the other zoos in Gaza, the Khan Younis facility is virtually unsupervised. There is no animal rights movement in the territory. Hassan Azzam, director of the veterinary services department in Gaza's ministry of agriculture, said, 'We have humble capabilities,' but the ministry encourages zoos. However somber the Khan Younis zoo, it does offer entertainment to children. Samir Amer, 14, snapped pictures of the animals with his mobile phone. 'I have been to this place before years ago but this is my first time seeing mummified animals,' he said. 'They look like they are asleep. I will print out the pictures of me standing next to the lion and put it on my wall. It will be fun to show it to my younger brothers.'","New .

A mentally-disabled woman and her five-year-old daughter were held in 'modern-day slavery' for two years by three people in northeast Ohio who abused them and kept them in line with venomous snakes and pit bulls, it was revealed today. Federal prosecutors say 26-year-old Jordie Callahan and 31-year-old Jessica Hunt utterly manipulated Shannon Eckley - even forcing her to beat her own daughter so they could record it on video. They allegedly told her that if she ever fled her bondage, they would use the footage to ensure her child was taken away from her. Between May 2011 and October 2012, Eckley and her daughter were locked in the basement of an apartment in Ashland, Ohio, and forced to do housework and look after Hunt's four children. All the while, Callahan and Hunt stole her government benefits and used the money on themselves, authorities say. Scroll down for video . Jessica Hunt, 31, and Jordie Callahan, 26 are accused of keeping Shannon Eckley as a slave for two years - threatening her and milking her of government benefits . Threats: The couple are accused of threatening to make their snakes and their pit bulls attack Eckley and her daughter if she didn't do their bidding . Eckley's enslavement bears chilling . similarity to the case of Ariel Castro, the man who was charged last . month with kidnapping three woman and keeping them against their will in . his house for ten years while he repeatedly raped, beat and emotionally . tortured them. Castro's house of horrors is located in Cleveland, Ohio, 65miles northeast of Ashland. Charges filed against Callahan and Hunt reveal that they treated her worse than the numerous dogs and reptiles they kept as pets - even feeding the animals in front of her while depriving her of food . and water. 'We are yet again reminded that . modern-day slavery exists all around us,' U.S. Attorney for the Northern . District of Ohio Steven M. Dettelbach said. Callahan is seen with one of the massive pythons he owned and used to threaten Shannon Eckley . The Ashland case has dark similarities to last month's revelation in Cleveland that three women had been keep captive for a decade . Daniel Brown is accused of aiding Hunt and Callahan . Authorities say the pair, along . with Daniel J. Brown, 33, controlled every aspect of life for . Eckley, who is said to have the mental capacity of a 13-year-old girl . after she sustained a head injury years ago. Perhaps . the most disturbing allegation against the three is that they forced . Eckley to beat her own child - who was just a toddler at the time. Eckley . told investigators that Callahan and Hunt demanded that she hit her . daughter and told her that if she did not, they would beat the child . even more viciously. They then recorded a video of the abuse on a cell phone. They told her if she ever 'messed up' or went to police, they would show it to authorities and Eckley's daughter would be taken away from her, according to prosecutors. When officers first investigated the case in October 2012, Callhan and Hunt showed police the video. Eckley was arrested. In February, she was sentenced to 150 days in jail after pleading guilty to two counts of child endangerment. Ashland County assistant prosecutor refused to discuss with MailOnline whether county prosecutors believed Eckley's story about being made to hit her child and why they pursued charges if Eckley was under duress at the time of the beatings. Federal charges allege Callahan and Hunt also repeatedly beat Eckley and her toddler daughter. When they were not beating them to keep them in line, they used their pets. The pair kept a poisonous coral snake, a ball python and a Burmese python that weighed 130 pounds as well as lizards, spiders, scorpions and 'numerous' dogs - including pit bulls. The pair used these pets to terrify and menage Eckley and her young daughter - threatening to turn them loose on the captives if they didn't behave. Callahan and Hunt live together and allegedly worked together to abuse Eckley . Hunt, who works at Wendy's, is seen handling a snake, as well. The coupled owned numerous pets that they allegedly looked after better than Eckley . Callahan and Hunt have four children who Eckley was forced to clean up after . Callahan posted numerous photos on his Facebook page of he and Hunt handling the creatures. One picture shows a snake coiled around a rat. Another shows Callahan apparently feeding a live chicken to his massive Burmese python. Callahan also allegedly used a gun to threaten Eckley on one occasion, as well. Callahan and Hunt invited Eckley and her daughter to come live with them in May 2011. It is unknown how she knew the couple. Authorities allege she arrived in a living hell. Once she moved in, the pair began treating her as a slave. They initially locked her in the basement and forced her to sleep on the concrete floor without a mattress. They deprived her of food - while lavishing attention on their animals. Callahan allegedly used dogs to threaten Eckley, as well . Eckley was only allowed to eat the leftovers after Callahan, Hunt and Hunt's four children had already eaten. Once, Eckley said, she and her young daughter had not eaten all day. Instead of giving the leftovers from dinner to her, Callahan gave the food to his dogs and made Eckley watch. Eckley was not allowed to feed her child fruit or vegetables, but she alleges that she was made to give fresh fruit to an iguana that roamed freely in her bedroom. The pair allegedly harvested the money Eckley received from government benefits and used the money for themselves. They also used her to get drugs. In December 2011, Callahan allegedly bashed Eckley's hand with a rock. He then took her to a doctor - leaving her child at the apartment - and told her to request a prescription for Valium. Once she got the narcotics, Callahan and Hunt used them for themselves. Callahan and Hunt invited Eckley and her daughter to come live with them in May 2011 . They executed the stunt a second time, as well. On that occasion, Callahan kicked Eckley in the hip. Brown is accused of aiding Callahan and Hunt by allegedly catching Eckley when she tried to escape. Authorities say he lied to her and said he would help her when he saw her outside the apartment. The couple also allegedly sent Eckley to the store to run errands, though they always kept kept her daughter at the house. In October 2012, on one of her trips to the store, Eckley was arrested for shoplifting after stealing a candy bar. She told police that she wanted to go jail because the people she lived with 'were mean to her.' The officer then questioned Callahan and Hunt, who showed him the video of Eckley beating her child. Eckley was arrested and charged, but further investigation revealed the the deplorable conditions she was living under, authorities say.","Shannon Eckley was kept for nearly two years in an apartment in Ashland, Ohio, starting in May 2011 .

David Cameron has launched a fresh assault on public sector pay - saying he was ‘surprised’ at the number of senior staff who earn more than him. He said he did not think it was fair that chief executives in local councils and the NHS should have a higher salary than the Prime Minister and the Chancellor. State salaries had been allowed to drift ‘up and up and up’ over recent years without any thought to whether such high rates were necessary to attract the best candidates. The Prime Minister earns £142,500 and it is believed that more than 300 staff employed by local councils take home more than him. Thousands more in the public sector, from NHS managers to doctors and BBC staff, also earn more. Mr Cameron also attacked ‘golden handshakes’ and generous early retirement deals which are often offered to departing highly-paid staff in the public sector. He made the comments at one a PM Direct question and answer sessions in Carlisle on Friday. When asked whether he thought it was fair that Jill Stannard, chief executive of Cumbria County Council, was on a salary of £170,000 - almost £30,000 more than him, he said: ‘The short answer is no, not really. ‘It’s quite surprising sometimes just how many people in the public sector are paid more than the Prime Minister and Chancellor of the exchequer. ‘A lot of public sector salaries drifted up and up and up and there wasn’t enough thinking about what we really need to pay to get someone who is good.’ Ms Stannard, 55, is taking early retirement to make way for a money-saving management shake-up at Cumbria Council. In the past three years the council’s budget has been reduced by £88m and it must save a further £50m by 2016. Attack: David Cameron, pictured with Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, has said that high NHS salaries do not necessarily attract the best staff . A series of top jobs could go, and a new interim chief executive will be on a much lower salary than Ms Stannard. Mr Cameron went on to attack golden handshakes - and called on councils to be more transparent about how they bring in such deals. He said: ‘There also wasn’t enough thought about what payment they get when they have to go and what sort of pay-out they get. ‘We’re changing this. We’re saying you have to publish all this information. Everyone should be able to see what council staff earn, what the contracts are, and there should be a vote on this properly. ‘I come from Oxfordshire, and in my constituency, West Oxfordshire, we share a chief executive with the neighbouring council. Making savings: Cameron said there was not 'enough thought' about how much public sector workers are paid . ‘There’s a lot more you can do. You can get police services, fire services to share some of the back office staff to share some of the payroll. ‘To think a bit more like a business and think what can I do to drive down costs whole still delivering a good product. We need government to think like that.’ It also emerged yesterday that councils have signed thousands of gagging orders which prevent individuals from blowing the whistle on poor practice and wrongdoing. They have signed agreements relating to pay-outs of more than £115million in the past three years, the vast majority of which contain gagging orders. More than 12,000 so-called compromise agreements were signed by 199 councils in Britain between 2009 and 2012.","Cameron said state salaries had been allowed to drift .

The UK pays almost  £1billion a year to cover the healthcare costs of Britons who fall ill on the continent – but receives only a fraction of that for NHS treatment of European visitors. Official figures show that last year taxpayers handed £903.4million to European governments and insurance providers to pay for the care of Britons. But the NHS managed to collect only £48.7million from the same European countries to pay for the care of their citizens who fall ill here. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt promised to 'shake up the system' to ensure fairness . It means that for every £18 the UK sends to Europe to pay for healthcare, it gets only £1 back. The figures underline how ineffective NHS hospitals are at clawing back money they are owed compared with those in Europe, amid claims that ‘health tourism’ costs British taxpayers billions a year. Many NHS trusts do not even keep records of debt. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt promised to make hospitals improve. ‘Our NHS processes to collect money from visitors aren’t good enough,’ he said. ‘That is why we are going to radically shake up the system to ensure we get fairness.’ Earlier this month cancer specialist Professor J Meirion  Thomas warned of a ‘massive and escalating problem’ of  foreigners travelling to Britain for cancer, HIV, kidney and infertility treatment, then leaving without paying. He said the NHS was also becoming the ‘world’s maternity wing’ as expectant mothers arrive just to give birth without paying. Experts have warned of Europeans travelling to the UK to get free treatment for cancer, HIV, kidney and infertility treatment . Some of the disparity in the figures, obtained with a Freedom of Information request, is because more British pensioners retire to the continent than those from the EU here. igures were not available to show the overall number of European visitors to the UK compared with Britons going abroad. But there are 1.4million migrant workers from the EU here, against 330,000 Britons employed in other European countries. In 2011/12, the UK paid Ireland £368million for treating Britons who fell ill there, but only £23million came back the other way. Some £247million was paid to Spain, but just £3.2million came back. France received £197million and returned £6.3million. Italy got £11million and sent back £850,000, and Greece collected £8million and returned £500,000. Julia Manning, of the think-tank . 2020health, said: ‘The fact that the NHS fails to keep proper records of . overseas visitors who come here from the EU is indicative of two . problems: the reluctance of staff to think of the NHS as a business that . should be run as efficiently as possible, and a system which depends on . governments chasing reimbursement, rather than visitors paying up . front.’ Robert Oxley, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘This is an incredible amount of taxpayers’ money leaving the NHS at a time when budgets are tight. It’s vital that checks are in place.’ The Department of Health highlighted the issue of pensioners. Those who retire on the continent are classed as ‘non-permanent residents’, meaning EU countries can claim payment for their healthcare. The department said: ‘The NHS is not there to serve the health needs of the world and we will not tolerate abuse of the system. ‘Last year we began a review to address concerns about access, cut down abuse and consider how best to ensure those who should pay do so. We are looking at a range of proposals.’","We pay £903.4m to cover the healthcare costs of Britons abroad .

A terminally ill 28-year-old woman has been granted the right to die by a judge after a dramatic legal battle with her parents. Grace Sung Eun Lee, a bank manager from New York who has terminal brain cancer, had told her parents and the doctors: ‘I want to die.’ But because her parents are deeply religious and belong to a Korean Christian church in Queens, they believe that allowing her daughter to choose death over life is a sin. A judge at the state appeals court today sided with Miss Lee after the rift with her parents  led to an agonising legal battle for the family. Doctors are set to be given the go-ahead to turn off her life support, unless her parents launch further legal action. Bitter battle: Grace Sung Eun Lee, centre, is on breathing tubes following a seizure from a brain tumour, but her parents will not allow her to be removed from the tubes . Devastated: Miss Lee's parents are pictured at the hospital after hearing the news that she has won the right to die . Happier times: Grace, centre, pictured with her parents Manho Lee, left, and Jin-ah Lee, right; her father is a pastor at a Flushing, Queens church . Speaking with the New York Daily News, Ms Lee’s mother, Jin-ah Lee, said: ‘Despite all this confusion, (my daughter) wants to go to heaven. I keep telling her she can get better.’ Her daughter is currently at Long Island North Shore Hospital, hooked up to breathing tubes that are keeping her alive. She is paralysed from the neck down due to the tumour on her brain stem. Ms Lee’s father is Antioch Missionary Church reverend Manho Lee, and practices out of his church in the Flushing neighbourhood of Queens. His congregation has flocked behind him to pray for Ms Lee and tell her of God's plans for her life. The sin of suicide, they said, would condemn their daughter's soul to hell. The difference in beliefs has led to an emergency end-of-life hearing at the hospital, with the two sides bitterly re-affirming their respective stances. Smiling: Ms Lee had worked as a manager at Bank of America and lived in Manhattan . Meeting: On October 1, there was a press conference at North Shore Hospital to inform the media of Grace's condition . Speaking on behalf of Ms Lee, Dr Dana Lustbader testified that the patient ‘consistently asks that her breathing tube be removed.’ However, Rev Lee and his wife argued that their daughter is heavily medicated, and is not lucid enough to make the life-or-death decision. End-of-life issues are ones that are at once vastly personal and highly polarised. According to the American College of Physicians, the important thing is to do what the person said they wanted, rather than what the person forced to make a decision. In cases where the patient cannot speak for themselves and there are no specific end-of-life wishes, the ACP suggests: ‘You can make a decision if you can determine what the person probably would have chosen,’ known as a ‘substituted judgment.’ Doctors said that her medications, including morphine and an anti-anxiety medication, are not strong enough to cloud her judgment. Ms Lee’s troubles began last year. Before her illness, she worked as a manager for Bank of America, living and working in Manhattan. She was also training for the famous New York City marathon. She had emigrated with her parents from Seoul, South Korea, the Daily News reported. But Ms Lee was devastated when she was diagnosed with a tumour in her brain stem. Though she received chemotherapy and radiation, the treatments did not successfully target the tumour, and last month, she had a seizure that eventually left her paralysed. Ms Lee had apparently talked to nurses at North Shore about removing the tubes, but her parents interceded. Offering support: Members of the congregation in Ms Lee's room, praying for her to be healed . Full of life: Grace Sung Eun Lee pictured before her illness . A Facebook page entitled Save Grace SungEun Lee cites a passage from the Old Testament, which reads: ‘”For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord. “Plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.”’ A post from Tuesday reads: ‘We can see God’s powers working every day and know that God has a plan for her too!’ Children from the congregation have written notes of encouragement for the 28-year-old, with one writing: ‘I hope you feel better. I miss you, Grace Teacher.’ Cultural, as well as religious differences have come to play in Ms Lee’s case. Rev Young Gab Hyun said: ‘In Korean culture…we believe that the decisions that the parents make have a lot more influence in this type of matter.’ Words of love: Young members of the church offered kind words to Ms Lee, calling her 'Grace Teacher,' and pleading with her to come back soon . ‘The role of religion in medial decision making really pertains to the patient,’ Tia Powell, M.D., the director of Montefiore Einstein Center for Bioethics, told MailOnline. ‘If the patient is capable of making her decisions, then that’s where we would honour.’ Dr Powell added that while it may be heart-wrenching for the parents to face, she said the goal of bioethics is to bring the families together. ‘The question is not whether she’s going to die, it’s how she’s going to die. ‘There’s nothing worse than losing a child,’ she said, ‘but there are limits to medical treatment. There are many things we cannot fix, we cannot perform miracles.’ Dr Powell said that there are some practices that could help Ms Lee’s parents come to terms with their daughter’s illness. ‘These are religious people, and they know we are all mortal,’ she said. ‘Being clear about that can maybe help decrease their suffering.’","Grace Sung Eun Lee, 28, is paralysed from neck down after brain tumour led to seizure .

Up to six new nuclear power reactors will power 14million homes for 60 years following a massive deal announced yesterday. In the most significant boost yet for Government plans for a new network of atomic power stations, Japanese engineering giant Hitachi took on a project to construct plants in Wales and Gloucestershire. The £700million deal will create 12,000 jobs for construction workers, engineers and other skilled employees, and spark a broader multi-billion-pound investment in the nuclear industry. Deal: Masaharu Hanyu, Hitachi's vice president and executive officer, at a news conference in Tokyo as it confirms it is to buy Horizon Nuclear Power . Two British firms, power systems provider Rolls-Royce and engineering services group Babcock International, will work with Hitachi on the project. Britain currently has ten nuclear power stations, generating a total of ten gigawatts of electricity, around 19 per cent of Britain’s electricity needs. By 2023, all but one – Sizewell B in Suffolk – will have become obsolete. This could trigger an energy crisis, as one third of Britain’s old-fashioned coal-fired and oil-fired power stations will effectively be outlawed by environmental legislation at the same time. The future of the nuclear industry had . been thrown into doubt, however, by the decision of Germany’s E.ON and . RWE to pull out of developments in the UK. Energy Secretary: Ed Davey said the move was a 'vote of confidence' in UK energy policy . Now Hitachi is buying Horizon Nuclear Power – which has the rights to build reactors at Wylfa on Anglesey, North Wales, and Oldbury in Gloucestershire – from the German firms. Ministers and unions hailed the deal, but green campaigners described it as a ‘risky and expensive gamble.’ David Cameron said the announcement was a ‘decades-long, multi-billion-pound vote of confidence’ in the UK. The Prime Minister added: ‘It will support up to 12,000 jobs during construction and thousands more permanent highly skilled roles once the new power plants are operational, as well as stimulating exciting new industrial investments in the UK’s nuclear supply chain.’ Energy and Climate Change Secretary Edward Davey said: ‘Hitachi bring with them decades of expertise, and are responsible for building some of the most advanced nuclear reactors on time and on budget, so I welcome their commitment to helping build a low-carbon secure energy future for the UK. I particularly welcome Hitachi’s firm commitment to involve the UK supply chain and local workforce. ‘New nuclear isn’t only about keeping the lights on and emissions down, it’s an industrial strategy with big potential wins.’ The minister said there had been a ‘huge amount of interest’ from across the world in buying Horizon, adding that the UK could now become a ‘springboard’ for nuclear development in other countries. He stressed there would be no public subsidy and that developers would be responsible for decommissioning costs. Mr Davey added: ‘We have made it very clear that there will be no public subsidy for new nuclear. There is no taxpayer subsidy in this at all.’ Hitachi and ministers played down safety fears in the wake of last year’s Fukushima power plant meltdown in Japan, pointing to the UK’s strong regulatory regime and the company’s track record in building safe nuclear plants. Tatsuro Ishizuka, vice-president of Hitachi, said the company would invest billions of pounds in UK nuclear operations, adding: ‘Our aim is to build safe nuclear power stations, on time and on budget, to provide long-term, affordable energy.’ Investment: Hitachi plans to employ its advanced boiling water technology, which is already in use in four reactors in Japan . However, Hitachi uses an advanced boiling water reactor for its plants – different from existing nuclear plants in Britain – raising concerns that it could take years to approve the projects. Mike Clancy, general secretary-designate of the Prospect union, said: ‘While Hitachi’s advanced boiling water reactor design has yet to undergo the UK’s generic design assessment approval process, it is a proven technology and therefore any construction in the UK will benefit from lessons learned from its construction  in Japan.’ Unite national officer Kevin Coyne said: ‘This is good news for the UK nuclear industry, for jobs and for a low-carbon future. ‘There are massive job opportunities here in the UK and we urge Hitachi to maximise the UK  supply chain.’ Greenpeace energy campaigner Leila Deen said: ‘It speaks volumes about the UK’s struggling nuclear programme that the Government is promoting a reactor that’s years from being granted UK safety approval and is designed by the company that helped build Fukushima.’ The Government has plans to develop new nuclear reactors on eight sites, but until yesterday had struggled to persuade companies to invest. The move by Japanese giant Hitachi to build new reactors in the UK has led to renewed calls by environmentalists for the nuclear programme to be abandoned. Hitachi's advanced boiling water reactor is different from existing nuclear plants in Britain and from designs being developed by other companies for sites here, prompting claims it will take years to approve the projects. Greenpeace energy campaigner Leila Deen said: 'It speaks volumes about the UK's struggling nuclear programme that the Government is promoting a reactor that's years from being granted UK safety approval and is designed by the company that helped build Fukushima. 'Instead of waiting years to find out how much billpayers will end up subsidising this project, the Government should join Japan and Germany, abandon nuclear, and invest instead in clean, renewable energy.' Friends of the Earth's Guy Shrubsole said: 'This is a risky and expensive gamble for Hitachi that other energy firms are unwilling to take - and contrary to the promises the coalition has made, the public will end up funding it. 'Nuclear has always delivered late and over budget, and crucially it won't reduce emissions until the 2020s, when to tackle climate change, we need emissions cuts to happen straight away.' He added: 'Last night's nuclear safety alert in the face of hurricane Sandy was a stark reminder of Fukushima and how vulnerable our energy infrastructure can be.' Hitachi said there were four advanced boiling water reactors in Japan, all of which were delivered on time, and another four under construction in Japan and Taiwan. The design is based on previous boiling water reactors, using water heated directly by the nuclear core to create steam to drive electricity turbines, of which there are 84 worldwide including in the US, Germany, Netherlands and India. The reactors at Fukushima, where nuclear disaster struck when the site was hit by an earthquake and subsequent tsunami in March 2011, were also boiling water reactors. But Professor Andrew Sherry, director of the Dalton Nuclear Institute at the University of Manchester, said the reactors at Fukushima dated back to the 1960s. 'The design will have advanced significantly between the 1960s and 2000s.' Professor Paul Howarth, director of the National Nuclear Laboratory, said boiling water reactors had to conform to the same safety standards as other plants, which the UK understood well. But he said the UK would need to train up operators so they understood the 'subtly' different requirements of boiling water reactors. Prof Sherry said he thought today's announcement was very good news for the UK, which had challenging targets to cut carbon that required the development of nuclear as well as renewables. But he said the need for a nuclear renaissance would not lead to corners being cut or decisions rushed through, saying 'that couldn't happen in the UK'.

Dame Vivienne Westwood, pictured left, has accused Jemima Khan, pictured right, of 'blind feminism' for saying Wikileaks founder Julian Assange should go to Sweden to face sexual assault allegations . He denies committing the sex attacks, and says he fears that, if extradited, he will be moved to America where he faces years in jail for publishing top secret US diplomatic communiques on the internet. Miss Khan, 39, lost the £20,000 she had provided as a surety for him to the UK courts when he jumped bail. She now believes he needs to go to Sweden and fight the allegations. Dame Vivienne has criticised Miss Khan for turning on the Wikileaks founder, less than 18 months after the pair were guests at Assange’s 40th birthday party. Writing on her blog, she said: ‘I believe that misapplied feminism is holding Julian in legal limbo, women living in the privileged world who blindly support feminism, not seeing the wood for the trees. ‘The word “rape” has been mentioned though there are no facts to support the allegation. ‘Women want this cleared up. “I wish he would go to Sweden to answer the claims” they say. Holed up: Jemima Khan lost the £20,000 she provided to the UK courts as a surety for Julian Assange when the Wikileaks founder, pictured at the Ecuadorian Embassy, skipped bail when facing extradition to Stockholm . ‘Do they really want our hero to satisfy their wish and vindicate himself by spending the rest of his life in a US Supermax jail? ‘Julian is in danger because through Wikileaks he exposed the killings our authorities cover up in wars which cause death and rape. ‘So I was sad and puzzled when my friend Jemima Khan joined the ranks of these irresponsible women. I phoned Jemima. I hope she will change her mind.’ The designer’s suggestion that sexual assault allegations are worthless without additional evidence has angered campaigners. Last night a spokesman for the Women’s Aid charity, which works to end domestic violence, criticised her assertion that there were no ‘facts’ to support the case. She said: ‘Her comments are thoughtless and ill-advised. They don’t help the feminist cause and certainly don’t help victims of rape. ‘We’re not talking about someone making a spurious claim, we’re talking about women who have made a complaint to the police. ‘We shouldn’t be giving credence to the suggestion that there needs to be more evidence than a woman’s claim she was raped. ‘Most people think Jemima Khan has done a noble thing saying “enough is enough”. ‘I thought Vivienne Westwood was the archetypal feminist, I’m not sure what’s changed in her life.’","Wikileaks founder Julian Assange accused of sexual assault in Sweden .

Michael Buckley died in hospital after breaking a hip when he was struck with a shopping trolley . The victim of a ‘trolley rage attack’ in a Marks & Spencer store has died – meaning the suspect could face murder charges. Michael Buckley, 60, suffered a broken hip and wrist when he was knocked to the ground in a busy branch three days before Christmas. A 30-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm. But the injured man’s condition deteriorated, he suffered a heart attack and on Tuesday he died at Princess Royal University Hospital in Farnborough. Mr Buckley was a frail man who stood around 5ft 4in and weighed just 8st. Suffering from severe ear problems, he wore two hearing aids and had retired from his long-term gardening job at a cemetery due to ill health. Following the death of his wife, Irene Christie, a model and actress, two years ago, Mr Buckley lived alone, grieving for her and caring for her macaw, Max, which had appeared in For Your Eyes Only alongside Roger Moore. A neighbour said: ‘Michael wouldn’t say boo to a goose – he was very frail.  And I heard that in the Marks & Spencer when this woman asked to go past he said, “OK, just a minute” – but she then barged into him. ‘I heard it wasn’t just once, but she came back for another go. Then he fell to the ground. And after he went to hospital he never came back.’ Michael Buckley and his wife Irene kept exotic birds and trained them for films including James Bond. The incident took place in the last few days before Christmas, when stores were crammed with customers. Mr Buckley was shopping at a large . Marks & Spencer food hall at around 1pm, in the Glades shopping . centre in Bromley, south-east London. Witnesses told police the woman at the centre of the inquiry shoved him with her trolley, knocking him to the ground. A member of staff said at the time that Mr Buckley was left sprawled on the floor in agony after the ‘moment of madness’. The employee said: ‘She just seems to have got enraged that he did not move out of her way quickly enough and rammed into him. ‘It is everyone’s nightmare. We have seen it so many times in the food hall, people are just so impatient these days.’ Another neighbour said Mr Buckley had looked ‘like a strong breeze would blow him away’. Death: Michael Buckley, 60, has died after being knocked to the ground at The Glade shopping centre in Kent . A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: . 'A 60-year-old man who was struck with a shopping trolley and knocked . to the ground on 22 December in Bromley, Kent has died.' They added: 'Police were called to a . store in The Glades shopping centre, in Bromley, at 1pm on December 22, . following reports of a man injured during an altercation. 'It is understood that the man, aged . 60, was struck with a trolley being pushed by a woman. 'He fell to the . ground and sustained injuries including a broken hip and wrist, and was . taken to a Kent hospital for treatment. 'On Wednesday, December 26, officers . were informed that the man had suffered further health complications and . that he was now in a critical condition.' A . neighbour, who did not want to be named, said she had known Mr Buckley . for 15 years, and told News Shopper: 'He loved wildlife and he was a . very generous man and very well liked man.' She . said he was married to Irene, who died two years ago, and that the . couple would go to Arizona every year on holiday because they enjoyed . filming hummingbirds. Shopping shock: The row allegedly broke out while the man was shopping in a Marks and Spencer . The neighbour added: 'He loved Elvis Presley and was a consummate fan. He was just a nice quiet pleasant man.' But she also described him as frail . and said he had taken early retirement from the office of Camberwell New . Green Cemetery some years ago because of a knee injury. She said: 'He wore a hearing aid and . even though he was 60 he looked much older and looked like a strong . breeze would blow him away.' Staff at M & S had said the woman . appeared to have launched the attack because the man had failed to get . out of her way fast enough. The clash appears to be the latest in a growing number of so-called ‘trolley rage’ incidents in our supermarkets. In November 2011, Hayley Cook, then . a  24-year-old pregnant mother, was jailed for a year after breaking a . woman’s pelvis outside a branch of Tesco in Ramsgate . The court heard she swore violently at Lynne White and crashing her trolley into her, also trapping her own son’s hand. In March that year police were called to Morrisons in Weymouth, Dorset, to break up a fight between shoppers. An elderly man was left with a head . wound after two shoppers bumped their trolleys into each other and a . brawl broke out.","Michael Buckley, 60, was struck by a trolley before Christmas .

"By . Jason Groves . PUBLISHED: . 14:30 EST, 20 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:57 EST, 21 March 2013 . The editor of the London Evening Standard issued a grovelling apology last night after the newspaper published details of the Budget before George Osborne stood up to deliver it. Sarah Sands said she was ‘devastated’ by the error, which resulted in a photograph of the newspaper’s front page story on the Budget being published on Twitter while MPs were still waiting for the Chancellor to begin. She said a ‘very young and inexperienced’ journalist had been suspended while the newspaper carried out a full investigation. Front page: While Chancellor George Osborne was on his feet delivering the 2013 Budget, the Labour front bench were closely studying photocopies of the Standard splash which had been tweeted . ‘We have immediately reviewed our procedures,’ she said. ‘We are devastated that an embargo was breached and offer our heartfelt apologies.’ A Treasury source acknowledged the episode had led to the early release of ‘market sensitive’ information on growth and borrowing forecasts. City traders and financial speculators could potentially have used the early sight of the figures to profit and any misuse would be difficult to prove. Commons Speaker John Bercow told MPs today that he had accepted the apologies of the Evening Standard for breaking an embargo on the Budget but would be asking the Chancellor to investigate why the briefing happened. Mr Bercow said he would take no further action against the newspaper after editor Sarah Sands and political editor Joe Murphy apologised after the London paper's front page, featuring details of the Budget, was tweeted before George Osborne stood up in the Commons yesterday. But the Speaker said the bigger problem was the 'prior briefing' to the newspaper. Making a brief statement in the Commons, Mr Bercow said: 'The Evening Standard yesterday published the main points of the Budget before the House was informed of them by the Chancellor. 'I have received formal apologies from the editor and from the political editor of the Evening Standard. They have also apologised separately to the Chairman of Ways and Means (Lindsay Hoyle). 'I shall place those communications in the library. Their error was extremely regrettable but I am minded not to take that matter further. 'However, the error would not have occurred had the newspaper not been in possession of prior detailed information about the Budget. 'This pre-briefing of Budget proposals is a matter of concern to me and, I judge, to the House as well. 'I am therefore writing to the Chancellor of the Exchequer to ask him to set out what happened on this occasion and whether this is a practice of the Treasury. 'I will revert to the House as necessary.' Apology: Editor Sarah Sands said the newspaper was 'devastated that an embargo was breached' 'So sorry': Political editor Joe Murphy apologised after details of Budget were published on Twitter before the Chancellor delivered his speech to MPs . It also led to embarrassment for Mr . Osborne, as Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls taunted him in the chamber by . waving a copy of the Standard’s front page – which revealed dire public . borrowing and growth forecasts – while he delivered his speech. Labour leader Ed Miliband demanded an . investigation and said Mr Osborne ‘almost need not have bothered coming’ to the Commons ‘because the whole Budget, including the . market-sensitive fiscal forecasts, were in the Standard’. Major Budget leaks are treated as a very serious issue at Westminster. In 1947 Labour chancellor Hugh Dalton resigned after inadvertently leaking details of his own Budget to a newspaper. In 1936, Cabinet minister Jimmy Thomas was forced to resign after an inquiry found he had leaked Budget details to a fellow MP and a business associate for personal gain. The Evening Standard, along with the major broadcasters, traditionally receives a privileged early briefing on the Budget to allow it to prepare its first edition, which goes to press while the Chancellor is on his feet. The details are released under a strict embargo which means they cannot be published before they are announced by the Chancellor. Sources at the paper stressed the incident was not technically a ‘leak’ but the breach of an embargo. The release of a picture of the Standard’s front page included the fact that this year’s growth target had been halved. The newspaper’s political editor, Joe Murphy, also issued an apology during the Chancellor’s speech. The Treasury is now likely to face questions from MPs over the level of detail pre-briefed to the media under embargo. Gordon Brown’s former spin doctor Damian McBride last night said Treasury officials appeared to have given the Standard far too much information and were not ‘entirely innocent’. He said normal procedure had been to tell the Standard only the broad themes of the Budget before the Chancellor stood up in the Commons. Mr Osborne last night asked for a review of the practice of pre-briefing the media under embargo.","Chancellor George Osborne was on his feet delivering the 2013 Budget .

Tragedy: Pensioner Eleftheria Demetriou was stabbed by Hakim Abdillahi who believed that she was the anti-Christ . A delusional killer who entered the country on a false passport was today sentenced to remain indefinitely in hospital for butchering a pensioner who he believed was the anti-Christ. Hakim Abdillahi, 38, repeatedly stabbed  Eleftheria Demetriou, 79, with such ferocity last August the blade snapped off. Abdillahi, who came to Britain from African country Djibouti in 1999 pretending to be six years younger, launched the frenzied attack a month after being discharged from hospital where he was treated for a personality disorder. But on August 15 Abdillahi - who was bullied in his homeland for being effiminate - killed the widow after stopping taking his medication and turning instead to cannabis and khat. Today, Abdillahi, from Wood Green, north London admitted manslaughter at the Old Bailey. Kaly Kaul QC, prosecuting, said the killer was friends with his victim whom he used to call 'grandma'. In the days before attacking the pensioner Abdillahi was behaving erratically and making alarming claims about doing God’s work and hunting the anti-Christ. After killing the mother-of-one he rang 999 but the ambulance service believed they had been called out to a cardiac arrest. When they arrived at the victim’s home, which was on the same estate as Abdillahi’s, paramedics found her body with multiple stab wounds and a cushion over her face. Miss Kaul said the killer, normally thought to be 'gentle and quiet', remained at the scene and was compliant. Abdillahi, who was convicted of battery in February 2011, told police at the scene 'You should be happy the anti-Christ is dead', the barrister said. On August 2, 13 days before the killing, he phoned police and told them he was being “picked on” and would kill himself if he did not get help. Nine days later he told officers 'the holy spirit was in him' and he had been taken by demons but knew where the anti-Christ lived, which was Mrs Demetriou’s address, the court heard. On August 13 neighbours said he was shouting up at the victim outside her house and he also prayed with her. Devastated: Eleftheria's son Marios Demetriou has spoken of the hurt that this has caused his family, with many of the requiring councelling . The day after he called police, Miss Kaul said, telling them 'he had just killed demons'. Twenty-four hours later, he killed Mrs Demetriou. Miss Kaul said he told paramedics and police 'I have killed the anti-Christ', 'God told me to do it - it is God’s will', and 'I was told to deal with her - you should be happy the anti-Christ is dead'. The barrister said that in Abdillahi’s police interview he told them that before he killed her, Mrs Demetriou knocked twice on his front door but he refused to answer it because he believed she was possessed. After she left, he took a knife, crystals and a DVD podcast to her home. 'He told her he knew who she was and plunged a knife into her body as many times as God told him to,' Miss Kaul said . A post-mortem examination showed the pensioner died from multiple wounds to the heart and spleen. In a victim impact statement, the pensioner’s only child Marios Demetriou said he was heartbroken by his mother’s death and that his whole family was in counselling. Mr Demetriou, who sat in court and broke down as details were aired, added that his seven-year-old daughter was so afflicted by her grandmother’s death she could not go to school and had nightmares that Abdillahi would kill her. Ross Johnson, the killer’s barrister, said Abdillahi had a history of self-harming and depression. He came to Britain in 1999 with a passport that claimed he was born in 1980 - he was actually born in 1974. Abdillahi was admitted to St Ann¿s Hospital in Haringey, north London, and discharged in July between three and four weeks before committing the crime . He settled in Cardiff after winning indefinite leave to remain but moved to London in 2004 when he was treated for depression. In 2007 he was admitted to hospital after hearing voices, suffering panic attacks and being unable to sleep. He was diagnosed with a borderline personality disorder. His barrister said that between 2007 and 2012 he progressed well with care in the community, although once “lashed out” at someone in a group hospital session. But in 2012 he was admitted to St Ann’s Hospital in Haringey, north London, and discharged in July between three and four weeks before committing the crime. Mr Johnson said he had a 'catastrophic collapse in his mental health' and was 'acutely psychotic on the day of the killing'. Abdillahi is currently being treated in hospital and is responding to anti-psychotic medication, he said.'But he currently has no insight into what he has done,' his barrister said. The judge, Richard Hone QC, made an order admitting the killer into a secure hospital with no time limit. 'What you did almost defies rational explanation,' he said.","Hakim Abdillahi repeatedly stabbed pensioner Eleftheria Demetriou .

But it has emerged the taxpayer has effectively been subsidising at least some of the former prime minister’s profit-making lecture tours since he left office. Mr Blair is taking advantage of free accommodation in luxury taxpayer-funded residences on his frequent trips overseas. Freebies: Tony Blair posing in Manila, Philippines in 2009 where he and his entourage were put up free of charge at the UK ambassador¿s official residence . On a visit to the Philippines, where he was reportedly paid £200,000 a time for two half-hour lectures, he and his entourage were put up free of charge at the UK ambassador’s official residence. They were able to enjoy a swimming pool, garden and tennis court at the residence, a Freedom of Information request revealed. Similarly secure accommodation in a private hotel would have personally cost thousands of pounds. Asked about such largesse being offered on a money-making trip, the Foreign Office last night suggested such freebies were routinely available to him. On the road: Globetrotting Tony Blair was in the US this week for the opening of the George W. Bush Presidential Center as one of his many foreign visits . Canny operator: Tony Blair has amassed a property portfolio worth millions, runs a lucrative consultancy business and charges thousands for public appearances . A spokesman claimed to have no list of all the accommodation provided free for Mr Blair, but said: ‘We offer Tony Blair the use of FCO residences when it is possible and appropriate. This is a courtesy which has been offered to other former prime ministers.’ Details of the trip to Manila in 2009 emerged in email correspondence. Mr Blair, who has amassed a property portfolio worth millions and runs a consultancy, spoke at a company function and at a hotel. He stayed at the residence of ambassador Peter Beckingham, who was appointed in 2005 when Mr Blair was prime minister. In an email Mr Blair’s aide asked: ‘Would it be possible for TB and some/all of the party to reside at the Residence? ...(and as you know we always like to visit with the Embassies who have given so much help and support over the years).’ Another email revealed that shortly before the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Mr Blair and wife Cherie holidayed in Malaysia for three weeks, where ‘Their host is the Sultan of Perak, Azlan Shah’. A spokesman for Mr Blair said: ‘We usually stay in hotels when working abroad and meet these costs privately.

Felicia and Cody Beemer, from Trumbull County, Ohio, originally pleaded not guilty to the charges. But yesterday, Cody, 23, changed his plea to guilty on charges of rape, gross sexual imposition and four counts of pandering obscenity involving a minor. It also emerged that he previously raped his 18-month-old nephew while they were babysitting him, which was also taped on the phone. He also pleaded guilty to that charge. Scroll down for video . Accused: Cody, left, and Felicia Beemer, right, are accused of raping their daughter, one, and videoing it on a cellphone - which also contained 532 images of child bestiality . Mugshots: Felicia Beemer, left, has had four children taken off her from birth and Cody Beemer will likely spend the rest of his life behind bars after admitting he raped his daughter, one . He was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole in 25 years on the rape charge. All other sentences will run along with the most stringent sentence. It was when an older relative found the SIM card with the footage on it that she turned it over to police. When they investigated, as well as the footage of the children being raped, police also found 532 images of minors either involved in or watching a 'montage of obscenity and bestiality', the indictment states. Judge Andrew Logan said: 'This is one of . the most outrageous and despicable acts that has ever come before this . court. We're talking about children of tender ages, newborns really . abused in the most outrageous manner.' Warren Law Director Greg Hicks said: 'The child is and has been in the custody of Children Services and during a scheduled visitation they are alleged to have raped the child. 'There are other allegations which we are . investigating, that there may in fact be more charges on one or both of . these individuals involving minors.' Mother: Felicia Beemer has had four of her children taken off her, all as soon as they were born, but was allowed to scheduled visits with them, which is when she is alleged to have raped one of them . Shackled: Cody, front, and Felicia Beemer, behind, are led into court in their orange prison suits and chains . The 13-month-old daughter was taken away from the couple as soon as she was born and there is currently an investigation underway as to how they were able to harm her during a supervised visit. Children's Services Board acknowledged they had relaxed the . supervised visitation for the Beemers prior to the rape and caseworkers were checking in on them only in 'timed . intervals' during the weekly two-hour-long visits, according to The Tribune Chronicle. Questions are also being asked about why Cody Breemer was even allowed on the premises as he is a registered sex offender. He sexually assaulted a three-year-old girl when he was a teenager, which CSB were aware of. In the wake of this investigation, CSB executive director Nick Kerosky has resigned.

Inspiring: Wing Commander Ken Gatward became an international hero after dropping the French flag on the Arc de Triomphe in occupied France . The incredible story of how a RAF pilot flew down the Champs-Elysees to drop a French flag over Nazi-occupied Paris has emerged after his medals were put up for sale. Wing Commander Ken Gatward managed the 'impossible feat' of flying his Bristol Beaufighter down the Champs-Elysees at 30ft before dropping the French Tricolour over the Arc de Triomphe. The daring act was a symbol of hope to the occupied French as the Arc honours those who fought and died for France in the French Revolutionary and the Napoleonic Wars. The British pilot then headed towards the Gestapo headquarters which he littered with 20mm shells - helping to boost morale in Paris when it was most needed. The attack sent the German SS troops running for their lives, to the delight of the Parisians who had seen them as an invincible enemy up until that point. The brave pilot volunteered for the dare-devil mission to boost the morale of the French and put the wind up the Germans. Wg Cdr Gatward’s inspirational antics were celebrated in British newspaper cartoons and raised the hope and morale among the British and French. One of the cartoons depicted his aircraft doing a loop around the Eiffel Tower, with the word ‘Hope’ written in the sky using his trail smoke. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and after the war he was hailed a hero by the French government who presented him with a huge bottle of Champagne and a Tricolour in Paris. Wg Cdr Gatward’s medal set, that includes his DFC with bar and a Distinguished Service Order, have now been put up for auction after the recent death of his widow. Daring: Ken Gatward needed to fly his Bristol Beaufighter at 30ft down the Champs-Elysees for the mission . Legend: The incredible feat in June 1942 gave a much-needed boost to French morale and was celebrated in the press with cartoons similar to the one shown above . Being sold with it are the pilot’s log books and the wooden commemorative Champagne case inscribed with the words ‘In Remembrance of Your Flight Over Paris’. A souvenir booklet featuring a sketch of the moment Wg Cdr Gatward and his observer dropped the Tricolour over the Arc de Triomphe with German army trucks on the ground is also being sold. James Grinter, of auctioneers Reeman Dansie of Colchester, Essex, said: 'Ken Gatward’s act of bravery is a real Boy’s Own story. Honour: Ken Gatward was presented with a Tricolour by the grateful French in 1949 . 'He was asked to volunteer for the ‘unsafe mission’ which was aimed as boosting the morale of the French and British people as well as undermine the Germans. 'This is June 1942 and the real dark days of war for the French and this was to demonstrate that the Germans weren’t invincible.' Wg Cdr Gatward was chosen for the sortie as he had demonstrated a skill for accurate flying during low-level attacks on enemy positions after Dunkirk. The British had been informed the Germans held daily parades down the Champs-Elysees and he was asked to strafe the parade. He and his navigator, Flight Sergeant George Fern, took off from Thorny Island, near Portsmouth, on June 12. After reaching Paris, he flew at just 30ft before Ft Sgt released the flag down the flare shute and over the Arc de Triomphe. Mr Grinter said: 'It is an amazing story - one of those that makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand up. 'He flew down the Champs-Elysees at second floor window height. It was an incredible act of bravery and a real audacious attack. 'He . attacked the Gestapo HQ and SS troops were seen to run for their lives. As he turned for home the Germans came out and shook their fists at . him. For sale: Auctioneers Reeman and Dansie are selling Gatward's medals later this week . Helping the war effort: Ken Gatward's audacious flight significantly helped the morale of the French . 'The attack gave Parisians one of the greatest thrills of the war and had a huge effect on the morale of the French and at home.' When Wg Cdr Gatward returned he entered a very bland entry into his log book to record the daring raid. Wg Cdr Gatward was awarded a second DFC in September 1944 for taking part in an aeriel attack on a German convoy in Norwegian waters. He spent 30 years in the RAF before retiring. He lived in Frinton-on-Sea, Essex, with wife Pamela and died in 1998 aged 84. His medals and other items are expected to sell for 8,000 pounds at the auction on Friday. Understated: Ken Gatward's bland log book entry for 12th June 1942 reads 'dropped Tricolour on Arc D'Triomphe, shot up German HQ, dead bird in radiator...'

In Africa, rhino populations are being pushed to extinction by the sickening trade in their horns for use in Eastern ‘medicine’. But it’s not just animals in the wild that are being threatened by the poachers. According to police, the hunters also have the zoos of Kent in their sights. Scroll down for video . At risk: Black rhinos at Port Lympne zoo in Kent may be targeted by poachers for their horns . As a result, the Aspinall Foundation, which has bred 33 black rhinos in the last seven years at its Port Lympne and Howletts wildlife parks, is seeking volunteers to help mount 24-hour security operations to protect its animals. The warning from Kent police wildlife officer Michael Laidlow follows those by the World Worldlife Fund that all rhino horns on animals alive or dead are potentially at risk. Poaching has rocketed in line with the rising value of the powdered horn – now at up to £50,000 a kilogram – thanks to growing affluence in China, where the substance is falsely claimed to cure everything from cancer to hangovers. Thieves have previously targeted rhino heads at the Haslemere Educational Museum, Surrey, and Norwich Castle Museum, as well as at museums across Europe. Protection: The Aspinall foundation are looking for volunteers in order to implement 24-hour security at Port Lympne zoo . In Africa, entire herds have been . slaughtered simply so their horns can be hacked off. A record 668 rhinos . were killed for their horns in 2012 in South Africa, up almost 50 per . cent on the number for 2011. The majority of the animals were killed in the Kruger national park, the country’s biggest wildlife reserve. Damian Aspinall of the Kent zoos said: ‘It is tragic and beyond belief that, as we do everything possible to restore these magnificent animals safely to the wild, the human traders who seek to profit from their slaughter should bring their vile activities to the UK. ‘In the light of what Kent police have told us is a genuine threat, we will do everything to protect our herds. Our volunteers will be recruited responsibly after careful vetting. Their presence will enable us to be vigilant and alert at every point at which the rhino could possibly come under threat. ‘We would also ask that visitors to Howletts and Port Lympne report any suspicious behaviour to staff and volunteers.’ For more information on Black Rhino's click here . Targeted: Kent Police warned the zoos this week that their black rhino population is under threat . The Aspinall Foundation, which claims to be the UK’s leading wildlife conservation charity, made its appeal for volunteers to help guard its herds of black rhino after receiving a warning from the Kent police animal specialist on Wednesday. Its rhinos are kept initially amid hundreds of acres of Kent countryside, but are also involved in a ‘Back To The Wild’ programme which aims to send captive-bred animals from endangered species to their natural habitats. Nine months ago three black rhinos from Port Lympne were returned safely to Tanzania where they continue to flourish.","Black rhinos at Kent zoos may be targeted by poachers for their horns .

Doctors are calling for more Britons to agree to donate their bowel for transplant after they die. Donor bowels can be used to cure severe cases of debilitating gut conditions such as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. Yet, although donor cards may indicate an individual is willing to donate all their organs, families must consent to each transplant. Family consent for bowel donation is lower than for other organs, including hearts, livers, kidneys and lungs. While 99 per cent of donor families agree to kidneys and livers, only 79 per cent give the  go-ahead for bowels. ‘Sadly, there seems to be limited awareness  of bowel transplants, among donors’ families and transplant  co-ordinators,’ says Darius Mirza, consultant transplant surgeon at Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham and Birmingham Children’s Hospital, and author of new research on the subject. ‘Donor families have to give permission for each organ separately, and sometimes this  can put extra strain on the  co-ordinator asking for consent and the families who have to decide at a time of immense grief,’ says Mr Mirza. ‘Families give consent more readily for the transplant organs that are better known.’ About 20 bowel transplants  were carried out in the UK  last year. Mr Mirza says: ‘The operation is life-changing, especially for young children born without a working bowel.’ Aid: Donated bowels can help cure Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis .","Donated bowels can be used to cure Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis .

Irritating: A survey of more than 2,000 managers today reveals the most irritating habits of Britain¿s office workers . They are an occupational hazard of the modern world. Management jargon such as 'thinking outside the box' and 'going forward' are among the worst annoyances for office workers today. Today a new survey of more than 2,00 managers reveals the most irritating habits of Britain's deskbound staff. And as well as using management speak such as 'Let's touch base', workers who send you an email despite sitting opposite you, and those who leave a smelly, dirty place on their desk after eating lunch are ranked among the worst offenders. The report, from the Institute of Leadership & Management, found ‘the nightmare colleague’ commits a long list of crimes. They arrive late in the mornings and for meetings, take regular cigarette breaks and come into work when they are ill when they should have stayed in bed. They gossip excessively about other workers, openly discuss confidential work matters and they bring their children into the office. Other offences include the use of ‘management speak’, which many managers described as a ‘pointless irritation’ which few people understand. The worst examples of jargon are ‘thinking outside the box’, ‘going forward’ and ‘let’s touch base.’ The tea round is also a source of fury among workers, with many becoming resentful that their manager never goes to buy the teas and coffees for them. But the winner is poor time-keeping. Nearly two-thirds of managers said they found their colleagues arriving late in the morning or for meetings as ‘their number one irritation’. Another big bugbear was workers who send an email, rather than talking to them, ‘despite sitting opposite’, an irritation shared by 56 per cent of managers. And office outfits are also a problem, with revealing outfits and flip flops a common source of problems. Pet hates: Workers with loud mobile phone rings and poor time keeping are among the most irritating things to happen in the office say bosses . Charles Elvin, chief executive of the Institute of Leadership & Management, said: ‘When office-based teams work in close proximity for long periods of time, we see that seemingly trivial issues can grow disproportionately, if left unchecked. ‘They can begin to cause upset and resentment.’ The report urges people to change their annoying habits in order to become a model colleague. One top tip is to avoid using email for some communication. It said they can be ‘impersonal and unclear’, and that many matters can be better dealt with on the telephone. Professor Cary Cooper, from Lancaster University Management School, said colleagues’ habits are increasingly irritating as Britons spend so much time in the office. Spreading germs: Workers who come in to the office ill when they should have stayed at home is a bugbear for many managers . He said: ‘The office is our first home, and then we have a place that we go to sleep and wake up to have breakfast with the kids for 20 minutes in the morning. ‘Millions of workers spend more of their waking hours at work than they do at home.’ The problem is growing as the traditional 9-5 day is replaced by a much longer one, with many workers starting earlier and leaving later every day. The Institute of Leadership & Management’s research was based an online survey of 2,165 managers in the UK who work in both the private and public sector.","A survey of 2,000 managers reveals UK office workers' irritating habits .

The device has been fitted to 274,000 people in America since 2003 . Parents with a history of alcohol abuse are being fitted with US-style ‘booze bracelets’ to determine whether they can keep custody of their children. In the first UK trial of its kind, the highly controversial ankle tags have been given to more than a dozen problem parents by the Family Drug and Alcohol Court (FDAC) so a check can be kept on their promises to stay sober. The devices detect traces of alcohol released through the skin and are commonly used in the States to monitor alcohol-dependent criminals and tackle anti-social behaviour. Troubled Hollywood actress Lindsay Lohan was ordered to wear one for a year after failing to turn up for a drink-driving court date. The UK trial, which began last November, has involved 13 individual parents referred to the FDAC in Central London after their drinking became so bad their children were taken into foster care. The court, set up in 2008 by District Judge Nicholas Crichton, warns parents that they must change their behaviour or lose their children for good. It has so far presided over more than 200 cases. If parents commit to change, the court has a multi-disciplinary team run by The Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust, a mental health unit, and Coram children’s charity to provide immediate intensive support. The bracelets, known as SCRAMx, are being used as an alternative to other forms of testing the FDAC routinely carries out, for example blood and urine samples and hair strand analysis. They clip on to the ankle and every 30 minutes, 24 hours a day, test for the presence of alcohol fumes emitted by the skin. These readings are then transmitted to a base station usually installed at the individual’s home. The base station uploads the data automatically to a central database in Denver, Colorado, where it is processed and sent back to the FDAC. This allows the FDAC to identify if any of the parents have consumed alcohol and, if so, how much and  how often. It can also determine whether the bracelet has been  tampered with. On average, FDAC parents have worn them for 42 days, but the longest time was 98 days. The FDAC says the system has proved highly successful and in a couple of cases parents have been allowed to return home with their children. Regularly tested: Lindsay Lohan flaunts her SCRAMx bracelet, which tests for alcohol every half an hour . Judge Crichton said: ‘We are dealing with troubled families who have child after child in the hope that one day the courts will let them keep one. 'In one London borough alone, 203 children have come into the care  system from just 49 mothers. ‘It seems crazy to go on in that way when there may well be another way of tackling their problems. It’s expensive to keep removing children and adopting them – far better to tackle the heart of the issue, which is drug or alcohol problems. ‘The bracelet is no more expensive than having a hair strand test, which is historical and not current. If alcohol is detected it sends out an alert. Punishment: Lohan was ordered to wear one for a year after failing to turn up for a drink-driving court date . ‘If this happens, we are notified immediately. It provides local authorities with a greater degree of confidence in allowing parents to have contact with children who are in care, and in one or two cases it has allowed children to go home to their parents on the basis that the local authority will know very quickly if the parent chooses to drink.’ Versions of the bracelet have been used in the US since 2003 and  have  been fitted to more than 274,000 people. Dr Claire George, laboratory director at Concateno, the worldwide drug, alcohol and healthcare testing organisation which manufactures the devices, said: ‘It’s about helping an individual succeed. ‘They can see on record that they’ve been successful.’","Family Drug and Alcohol Court given bracelets to more than a dozen parents .

A surgeon banned from operating at a children’s heart unit at the centre of a scandal over high death rates was previously investigated over his practice. Sri Lankan-born Nihal Weerasena is the doctor who agreed to stop carrying out operations at Leeds General Infirmary two weeks ago while bosses investigated concerns over his abilities. But Dr Weerasena also previously stood aside in 2005 after the hospital identified problems relating to a procedure he was carrying out to repair a congenital heart defect. Suspended: Nihal Weerasena has agreed to stop carrying out procedures at Leeds General Infirmary while bosses investigate concerns over his abilities . Scandal: The unit at Leeds General Infirmary is set reopen next week if hospital chiefs can convince NHS officials there are no safety concerns . The hospital, which then had concerns . over Dr Weerasena’s success rates with the procedure, asked the Royal . College of Surgeons to carry out a review of his practice. Dr Weerasena, 59, no longer carries out the specific procedure at the hospital but has been allowed to remain part of the paediatric cardiac surgery team at Leeds. His latest suspension was revealed by The Mail on Sunday two weeks ago but the hospital has refused to confirm his identity – even though he stepped aside just before all surgery was halted at the unit over fears the death rate was twice the national average. The unit is set to reopen next week if hospital chiefs can convince NHS officials that there are no safety concerns. One mother is demanding a fresh investigation into her seven-year-old daughter’s death after learning of the concerns raised about Dr Weerasena. Mrs Burton, 39, a civil servant from York, lost Eve – her only child – after a third operation for a congenital heart condition in March last year which was carried out by the surgeon. Tragic: Mrs Burton's lost her seven-year-old daughter Eve after her third operation on a heart condition . Eve had an initial operation in 2005 at . just ten weeks old to insert a donor artery, and needed regular . follow-ups and further surgery as she grew. A second operation in . December 2009 was also a success. Neither operation involved the procedure that had been investigated by the Royal College of Surgeons and neither involved Dr Weerasena. However, he did carry out the third operation last year when Eve died hours after a procedure to replace her artery led to the failure of a heart valve. Mrs Burton said: ‘I knew the surgery would be risky but it certainly wasn’t spelled out that she might not make it. I did ask Dr Weerasena for the success rates of the operation and he told me he was unable to do so. ‘I kissed Eve and told her I would see her later. But after being in surgery all day, he came out and told me there had been complications and a heart valve had burst under the pressure.’ Mrs Burton held several meetings with Dr Weerasena but says she still does not understand why her daughter died. Dr Weerasena trained at the University of Rajasthan in India and qualified in 1978. He has been working at Leeds General Infirmary for more than ten years. Asked if he was the surgeon who had been suspended, he said: ‘You need to speak to the trust.’ A spokesman for Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust refused to confirm the surgeon’s identity. However, he added: ‘The reason the surgeon stopped working was nothing to do with mortality rates or children’s heart surgery.’ Commenting on the 2005 investigation, the trust said its findings were implemented in full and the surgeon voluntarily decided not to undertake the particular procedure in future.","Dr Nihal Weerasena stopped carrying out procedures at Leeds General Infirmary two weeks ago .

In yet another controversy to engulf Australian radio in recent weeks, Dunleavy - the self-proclaimed Queen of Melbourne Radio - was forced to deny she was 'victim blaming' after receiving a 'torrent of abuse' from angry Nigella fans. 'It’s hard to look a the photos of Nigella Lawson, her eyes wide with panic, her husband Charles Saatchi’s hand wrapped around her throat, without feeling revulsion and disbelief,' she initially wrote. 'The ‘Domestic Goddess’ is not flirty and fun as fans of her cooking shows know her, but fearful.' She went on to ask why Nigella then posted a 'picture of a buttered, toasted bagel on her official Twitter page, as though nothing else was on her mind but food' while the pictures of the apparent row were going viral online. 'That’s not the response we were after, Nigella,' she added. 'We think you are strong, beautiful and successful [... and] we don’t like to think of you cowering from a thug.

Swimmer: Before chairing meetings of world leaders, David Cameron stripped off to go swimming in Lough Erne . David Cameron dragged a reluctant police protection officer on an early morning swim in the freezing waters of Lough Erne. The Prime Minister, a fan of so-called 'wild swimming', decided he fancied a dip just after dawn today. 'He joked with the police that they are supposed to give him ""close protection"" and so they had to come in, and one did,' said a Downing Street source. The Prime Minister told colleagues that his swim, which took place just after 6am, had been 'early, brisk and cold'. To the delight of Number Ten officials, Russian president Vladimir Putin, who normally delights in macho displays at international summits, apparently decided the Northern Irish waters were too chilly and stayed in bed. Mr Cameron said as the summit ended: 'I can recommend a swim in the lough. That's what I did. 'I have the photographic evidence but I am not going to share it with you. It certainly wakes you up and gets you going for a hard day chairing this summit.' The Prime Minister later tweeted that there had been 'no sign of the Russian President when I was swimming in a cold Lough Erne this morning, but his sporting prowess is clear'. The waters of Lough Erne are currently around 14 degrees and the lake has also been overrun by zebra mussels, an invasive species which poses a hazard to the bare feet of swimmers. However, Mr Cameron 'has a Labrador-like tendency to jump into water, no matter how cold', according to his biographer Francis Elliott. He has said that ‘I spent all my early years swimming in Polzeath and I know what wonderful waters there are in Cornwall'. More recently, the Prime Minister has spoken of swimming in the sea off his father-in-law Lord Astor’s estate on the Isle of Jura. He also has a fondness for swimming in the lakes of Cumbria, particularly the notoriously chilly Ullswater. 'I have a guilty secret - every year since being prime minister I tell myself that I have to get to Cumbria and swim in one of the lakes. So far I have managed it,' he has said. Talks: British Prime Minister David Cameron joked that the lough was cold but good preparation for chairing meetings . Scenery: The lake has provided the backdrop for many of the photo opportunities of the summit, including this snapshot of US President Barack Obama and Mr Cameron, walking with Ireland's Taoiseach Enda Kenny .

How many police officers does it take to secure a G8 summit? Not as many as the authorities thought, if the scenes around Enniskillen have been anything to go by. With no disorder to deal with some of the 8,000 policemen and women deployed in this quiet corner of Northern Ireland have found innovative ways of keeping occupied. A group on duty at one landmark had a competition to see who was the best bannister slider. Others have spent their breaks enjoying the welcome sun on the town’s riverbanks. And mischievous local officers reportedly broke the ice with Yorkshire colleagues by driving past playing the theme tune to the TV soap Emmerdale. The Prime Minister is patron of the Chipping Norton lido in his constituency, and once dived into the sea to save historian Andrew Roberts, a friend, from a school of dangerous jellyfish. Mr Roberts said it was a moment that showed the Prime Minister's 'great physical as well as moral courage'. Mr Cameron was 29 and on holiday in Miramar, in the South of France, with his wife Samantha when they joined friends for a boat trip. Also on board the vessel, which belonged to Daily Mail journalist Robert Hardman, was writer and socialite Petronella Wyatt, Andrew Roberts and his girlfriend, now his ex-wife. Mr Roberts, then 33, insisted on swimming 100 yards from the boat to reach two local landmarks known as Les Deux Freres - 80ft tall volcanic monoliths. 'The sea was swarming with a horrible, menacing school of large jellyfish, one of which had stung me,' he added. 'It was frightening. They were transparent with a green tinge and had very long tentacles. There must have been 40 or 50 of them, so large that you would have struggled to squash one into a bucket. 'I yelped and squealed and waved desperately at the boat, but because of the rocks Robert couldn't bring it in to reach me. 'I knew that if I had to swim blind through the jellyfish, many of which were hiding under the surface, I would be repeatedly and badly stung. Things weren't looking good.' Action man: Swimming in lakes has previously been seen as the recreation of choice for Russian President Vladimir Putin, pictured taking a dip in 2009 . Fortunately, Mr Cameron leapt from the boat. 'I realised he was coming to my rescue. He had goggles and had grabbed a spare pair for me. I still don't think it's something most people would have done,' Mr Roberts added. 'He swam within about 20 feet of me, through some of the jellyfish, to perform an Olympian throw. It was pretty impressive - it's not easy to throw any distance or with any accuracy when you're in water. He played cricket at Eton, I think, so that no doubt helped. 'I grabbed the goggles and then I could see where the jellyfish were, so I could navigate through them. Dave was doing the same. 'It seems funny now, but at the time I was terrified. The welt on my arm stung for about two days. If Dave hadn't rescued me and I'd been forced to swim through the jellyfish, I would probably have been hospitalised. It would certainly have ruined my holiday. 'I told him he was a hero, and I was serious. But he quite typically brushed it off. He's always downplayed it whenever I've mentioned it.' * Perhaps it was David Cameron's attempt to show the G8 he wanted to call the tune. The Prime Minister adopted a musical theme for his personal gifts to the other leaders. Among them was a USB stick featuring songs by lesser-known British acts, such as Jake Bugg, Alt-J and Lianne La Havas. He also gave to each of them the best-selling album by a UK artist in their respective countries.Other gifts were designed to highlight Northern Irish brands, producers and artists. They included a book of photography by local artist Chris Hill, bottles of 12-year County Antrim Old Bushmills Distillery reserve whiskey with a personalised G8 label, Co Couture chocolates from Belfast and handmade oak pens by County Down-based Tulip Woodcrafts.","Prime Minister drags protection officer into freezing waters .

Every family in Britain could be £380 better off from a landmark trade deal between the United States and Europe. David Cameron hailed the ‘biggest bilateral trade deal in history’ at the launch of negotiations for an agreement which could be worth £100 billion to the European Union economy. In the first major announcement of the G8 summit in Northern Ireland, Mr Cameron and US President Barack Obama removed their ties to strike a casual look at the Lough Erne resort. Scroll down for video . Casual: The start of formal talks on an EU-US trade deal was announced by European Council President Herman Van Rompuy, US President Barack Obama, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso and UK Prime Minister David Cameron . Mr Cameron had been keen to use this . week's summit in start the formal talks to strike a deal which Downing . Street claims could be worth up to £10billion to the UK alone. Speaking . at a press conference, the Prime Minister said talks to break down . trade barriers between the EU and the United States could create two . million extra jobs and would help to ‘fire up’ global economies. He . added: ‘There is no more powerful way to achieve that than by boosting . trade and there's no better way than by launching these negotiations on a . landmark deal between the European Union and the United States of . America, a deal that could add as much as G£100 billion to the EU . economy, £80 billion to the US economy and as much as £85 billion to the . rest of the world. We are talking about what could be the . biggest bilateral trade deal in history. A deal that will have a . greater impact than all the other trade deals on the table put . together.’ Contrast: President Obama chose to don a jacket at the press conference (left) but there was no sign of the tie he wore on a visit to a school in Enniskillen . Change: The Prime Minister looked smart at he visited the school but opted to go tieless and jacketless for the press conference at the G8 . The announcement does not mean a deal has been struck, but signals what could be months of thrashing out the details of an agreement to make it easier for businesses in the EU and the US to trade with each other. America will host the first round of negotiations next month, President Obama said as he hailed the ‘potentially groundbreaking partnership’. He warned against ‘downgrading ambition’ in a rush to strike an agreement, insisting both sides had to be bold. He added: ‘I am hopeful we can achieve the kind of high standards comprehensive agreement that the global trading system is looking to us to develop. ‘America and Europe have done extraordinary things together before and I believe we can forge an economic alliance as strong as our diplomatic and security alliances.’ Talks: It could take many months for the deal to be struck, with President Obama warning against rushing to reach an unambitious agreement . President Obama said it was important that the US and EU ‘get it right’. ‘That means resisting the temptation to downgrade our ambition or avoid tough issues just for the sake of getting a deal.’ The president said the leaders would be giving a ‘mandate’ to their negotiators, but added that it was likely they would have to step in personally to resolve particularly difficult issues. Their appearance at the press conference kickstarting the G8 summit was in stark contrast to an earlier visit by Mr Cameron and Mr Obama to a local school where, still wearing ties, they joined in with an art session. The two leaders visited Enniskillen . Integrated Primary School as they prepared for the formal start of the . two-day summit being held in the Northern Irish town from this . afternoon. En route in the . president’s armoured car, known as The Beast, the pair discussed the . fraught issues facing global leaders gathered in the UK for the annual . talks, most notably the serious split in the international community . over the Syria crisis. They . were resuming the discussions in the vehicle on the return journey to . the luxury golf resort on the shores of Lough Erne which is hosting the . summit. It was all smiles as . they chatted with pupils in a classroom of the modern school building - . which educates equal numbers of Catholic and Protestant pupils. Allies: David Cameron and Barack Obama helped students paint a mural during a visit to the Enniskillen Integrated Primary School in Enniskillen ahead of crunch talks on Syria at the G8 summit . Art: The US President and British Prime Minister signed a project at the school to mark the summit being held in their town in this pictured posted online by Mr Cameron . Message: Mr Cameron wrote 'with thanks for all you do' while Mr Obama added 'dream top dreams' It is the only integrated primary school in County Fermanagh - and was set up by a cross-community group in the wake of the 1987 Remembrance Day Provisional IRA bombing in the town which killed 11 and injured 63. At present, only 6% of primary and secondary schools are integrated and the importance of mixed-faith education was one of the central messages of Mr Obama’s speech about the peace process in Belfast this morning. The politicians, who were shown around by 11-year-olds John Sammon and Meabh Mackin, also signed a G8 tapestry. But the pair’s friendly rivalry - previously seen at table tennis, among other arenas - was soon on show when they joined a group in the playground finishing the large artwork. “Do you think you can handle this David?,” the US president joked as he pointed the Prime Minister towards a section to paint. Mr Obama was soon admitting he was in trouble for “going outside the lines” - securing an assurance from pupils that he would not be punished. Give up: After failing to keep inside the lines, President Obama boasted he could have been an artist . Art: Mr Obama painted the 'E' while Mr Cameron filled in the second 'n' during their visit to Enniskillen Integrated Primary School . But it was Mr Cameron who received praise from the teacher - and three cheers from the pupils - for finishing his section first and not straying beyond the boundaries in his work. “I didn’t realise David was going to move so fast,” Mr Obama joked. But he refused to admit defeat, insisting: “I’m not as good as these guys but I’m better than David.” The leaders - both wearing blue ties but with Mr Cameron in a blue shirt to the president’s white - first signed their names on a G8-themed patchwork quilt. Mr Obama wrote ‘Dream Big Dreams’ while the Prime Minister added ‘With thanks for all you do’ under his signature. Moving on to the classroom, they were treated to a show of the youngsters’ knowledge of the summit. The leaders went to the playground to engage in their artistic contest - the President choosing to colour in with blue paint the initial ‘E’ of Enniskillen on the giant artwork spread across several tables while the Prime Minister took on the second ‘n’. Within seconds, Mr Obama admitted: ‘I think I’ve gone outside the lines.’ He was later told that not only had he failed to match Mr Cameron’s neatness but had not managed to complete his colouring task either.","David Cameron and Barack Obama launch formal talks on trade deal .

"By . Hugo Gye . PUBLISHED: . 10:45 EST, 20 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:45 EST, 20 June 2013 . Jailed: Aubrey Anderson has been sentenced to four years in a Belgian prison . A nanny who broke a baby's legs in Utah has been sentenced to four years in prison for an almost identical crime she committed in Belgium. Aubrey Anderson could now be extradited to Europe after being convicted in a Belgian court of assaulting a pair of twins who were just 16 days old. The 32-year-old has denied the charges, and says she may voluntarily travel to Belgium to defend herself in a possible retrial. In June 2011, Anderson became the nanny to a pair of newborn twins in Bruges. Just over two weeks after their birth, their parents took them to hospital where they discovered that their arms and legs had been fractured multiple times. However, during the hospital visit Anderson took the chance to flee the country, and has been wanted by Belgian police ever since. She is believed to have offered her services as a childminder, and early last year was taken on as a nanny by a couple in Park City, Utah. Anderson was hired to look after a pair of twin babies, around one month old, overnight. But when the day nanny noticed that one of the children had bruises and swollen limbs, their parents took them to the doctor. It then emerged that one of twins had two broken ankles, leading Anderson to be prosecuted for child abuse. Following a plea deal with prosecutors, she was handed five years of probation earlier this month. Abuse: Anderson has twice been convicted of mistreating newborn twins and leaving them with broken bones . But now a judge in Belgium has sentenced Anderson to four years in prison in a hearing held in her absence. Belgian authorities will now seek to begin extradition proceedings so that the nanny can serve out her sentence. A treaty between Belgium and the U.S. allows the countries to extradite criminals sentenced to one year or more in prison. 'Our office has always believed that Belgium had a strong case against her and that she would face justice in that country,' Summit County Attorney David Brickey said in a statement. Anderson's defence lawyer Clayton Simms has suggested that she will be given a retrial if she travels to Belgium, and said she may go voluntarily. 'She may choose to waive extradition and go there and face the court,' he told the Deseret News. 'She feels strongly that she has a good position, that she's innocent.'","Aubrey Anderson, 32, on probation after breaking legs of month-old child .

"Judge said . internet was being 'hijacked by those who pander to the unacceptable and evil for . profit' By . Emma Reynolds . PUBLISHED: . 06:50 EST, 1 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 19:49 EST, 11 June 2012 . A child porn addict who began looking at indecent images when he was just 15 amassed almost a quarter of a million pictures by the time his 'base' addiction was uncovered. Daniel Hylands, 27, began looking at indecent pictures of children online while he was still a schoolboy and was caught 12 years later when police raided his Merseyside home. He was tracked down after he used a credit card to pay a sophisticated system allowing access to more than 200 websites containing sick images of children. Addiction: According to experts children are more likely to get hooked on pornography and some have even said to be spending 10 hours a day looking at explicit material . A survey this week revealed that two-thirds of the public back the Daily Mail’s campaign for an automatic block on online porn. The Mail has called on Internet Service Providers to block porn sites from homes unless adults ask to see sexual content when they set up internet access. But the Government is resisting the opt-in system, preferring a less stringent opt-out alternative in which users are asked when they set up their internet access whether they want porn blocked. Experts who analysed Hylands's computer tower after it was seized in May 2010 found 228,681 images of abused children, said prosecutor Paul Blasbery. The vast majority were in the least serious category but there were some in all five classifications, including 154 in the two most serious groups. When interviewed, store manager Hylands admitted he had started viewing such images when he was 15, but he initially claimed he had wanted to identify those looking at them so he could expose them to the authorities. Hylands, now of Southport, pleaded guilty at Liverpool Crown Court to 17 offences of downloading child porn images covering a four-year period. Shame: Hylands admitted the charges at Liverpool Crown Court, but he initially claimed he had wanted to identify those looking at them so he could expose them . Judge John Phipps said: 'The . internet, which could be of so much benefit to all, has a tendency to . be hijacked by those who pander to the base, unacceptable and evil for . profit, in particular this kind of filth. 'Each of these images - and there is a massive number in this case - is an image of an abused, exploited child.' Judge . Phipps said Hylands was an intelligent young man still held in . high regard by his employers and being supported by his devastated . parents. 'The support from your family is not unthinking and not unqualified,' he pointed out. The judge said he accepted Hylands was now genuinely remorseful and that if he jailed him it would be for a relatively short time and he would not receive the help he needs to deal with 'his unhealthy obsession.' Judge Phipps added: 'Of course you deserve to be punished. On the other hand I have to consider whether this kind of behaviour to which you had become addicted can be prevented from reoccurring in the future.' He made a three-year supervision order and ordered him to attend the intensive Northumbria Sex Offenders programme. He also ordered Hylands to sign the Sex Offenders Register for five years, made an indefinite Sexual Offences Prevention Order restricting his internet access and confiscated his computer equipment. The Daily Mail's campaign is supported by figures that show 15,000 youngsters have been expelled or suspended from school for sex offences against fellow pupils and teachers in the last five years. More than 1,100 were primary school children, with some as young as four. Offences included sexual abuse, assault, harassment, and lewd behaviour. A study by the London School of Economics found that parents have little idea what their children are looking at, with more than two thirds of parents whose children had looked at adult content saying they were were certain their child had not, or that they did not know. Middle-class children were more likely to access porn online than those from poorer backgrounds, because they were more likely to have computers in their own rooms.","Daniel Hylands was tracked down 12 years after he started looking at indecent images of children .

Hissan Dar was jailed for three and a half years after stealing £110,000 from a couple with learning difficulties . A gambling-addicted bank cashier who stole £110,000 from the account of a couple with learning difficulties was jailed for three-and-a-half years today. NatWest worker Hissan Dar, 26, persuaded Stephen and Frances West to give him their cash card after promising to protect them from fraud. Dar then took money from the couple, who he had advised for years, when they received a £200,000 inheritance from Mr West's mother. Dar, who had worked for the bank for ten years and earned a £26,000 salary, told them he was paying their bills, managing their cash and paying into a funeral plan for them. Instead he spent £36,000 on roulette machines and bets on horse racing at a Ladbrokes store yards from the branch he was working at in Richmond, southwest London. Dar also made cash withdrawals totalling £68,000 and £3,000 of credit card purchases, as well as applying for thousands of pounds of loans. He was finally caught when other cashiers noticed suspicious activity on the West's account. When he was arrested, he tried to claim the Wests had blown the money themselves on an extravagant lifestyle. He later admitted fraud and was jailed at the Old Bailey for what Judge Timothy Pontius described as a 'deliberate and mean-minded' scam. Judge Pontius said: 'You deliberately . targeted the account and therefore the very modest income of a . thoroughly decent couple who had reposed a high degree of trust in your . handling of their financial affairs. Gambling addict Dar pictured leaving a shop after using one of the bank cards. He blew their money on bets and roulette machines and then tried to blame the couple for leading an extravagant lifestyle . Dar, pictured at the Old Bailey, gained the trust of the couple and then used their money to fund his gambling addiction . 'They . relied on your professional acumen and advice to a significant degree . given their learning difficulties and obvious lack of familiarity with . the complexities of managing an account in a time of fiscal constraint . and uncertainty.' The Wests have been refunded by NatWest and the judge said the bank should be commended for this. But he added: 'That financial loss is . perhaps less significant to them than the undoubtedly shocking effect . upon them of learning that the man in whom they had so completely placed . their trust over a period of years had disgracefully abused that trust . to such an extent.' The . court heard Mrs West, in her 50s, had learning difficulties and poor . eyesight, while Mr West, in his 60s, also had 'below average' intelligence. Both worked part-time in a poppy factory. Prosecutor Juliet Oliver said: 'They are physically quite frail as well. 'But Mr and Mrs West have always endeavoured to live as an independent couple as best they can, although they do receive support in the community. 'Their main aim is to try and avoid being thought of as stupid. 'They believed bank employees were not only trustworthy but able to assist them in organising their financial affairs.' Their trust was shattered on June 29 last year when they went to NatWest to withdraw money. 'They explained they needed more than the £200 cash Mr Dar had allowed them to cover the period he was away on holiday,' said Ms Oliver. 'They didn't have their cash card as Mr Dar held them, he said to protect them from fraud. 'Staff did a check and saw £300 had been withdrawn earlier that day through an ATM. 'There was a pattern of recent withdrawals in sums of hundreds of pounds. Dar worked as cashier at the NatWest branch in Richmond. The bank has refunded the money to the couple . Dar spent tens of thousands gambling on roulette machines (right) and horse racing at the Richmond Labrokes . 'When asked, the Wests said it was probably Hissan. They refused to believe anything could be amiss with their accounts. 'Such was their trust that they actually telephoned him that evening.' Further investigation showed huge amounts of money had gone missing since March 2011, with a large chunk spent on gambling. Mr West said he had only ever bet £5 on a horse race and £4 on the Eurovision song contest. When he was arrested, Dar claimed the Wests had spent the money themselves, telling police they ate out at restaurants three times a day. He later owned up, but claimed he had been trying to support his family after his father was laid off. Madeleine Wolfe, defending, said: 'He is perhaps not a callous or devious man but a man who lost control of his finances and turned in desperation to criminal activity. 'He is thoroughly ashamed of himself, as he ought to be.'","Hissan Dar persuaded the couple of give him their cash card .

It brought down tonnes of masonry and brickwork at the exact spot the teenager was about to enter. Bexi Hebbourn said she was seconds away from being hit by a tractor that ploughed into the back of her house . The tractor caused £25,000 worth of damage when it smashed into the back wall feet away from Bexi . Bexi said she would have been struck by the mound of rubble if she had gone to put the washing out 10 seconds later. The accident caused £25,000 damage to the house in Ulverston, Cumbria. The GCSE student, said: 'I was walking down to the tumble dryer to put some clothes in with a basket in my hand and a couple of moments later something hit the wall and then the door of the wall came flying off and nearly hit our dogs, Rusty and Beatrix. 'There was a big tractor wheel poking out. If I had set off to put the washing in 10 seconds later, I would have been standing there.'

Austen Harrison was in the changing room at the Hugo Boss outlet store at Bicester Village, Oxfordshire, on June 4, as his father tried on some clothes. The boy from Crawley, West Sussex, suffered severe head injuries when the mirror 'collapsed' and was rushed to hospital where he died four days later.

One of Mr Cameron's advisers at the . summit said African countries are losing twice as much in tax avoidance . as they receive in foreign aid from the West. Sally Copley, spokesman for the IF . campaign on global hunger, said: 'Today's G8 tax deal is a step in the . right direction, but it also leaves major unfinished business. 'It's progress that more tax . authorities will know who owns phantom firms so they can crack down on . them, but a summit focused on transparency can't justify keeping this . information secret.' But Katja Hall, CBI Chief Policy . Director, said: 'We'd strongly oppose full country-by-country reporting . in the future, which would risk swamping people in highly complex data, . rather than improving transparency.' At . the weekend Britain secured agreement from 10 of its overseas . territories and Crown dependencies, widely viewed as tax havens, to sign . up to a new OECD standard on the exchange of tax information.

David Cameron took advantage of the opportunity to have an outdoor swim before work today. The gathering of leaders from the world's biggest economies is taking place in a luxury golfing resort on the banks of Lower Lough Erne. the waters of the lake are temptingly visible from the conference rooms where the Prime Minister and his guests are discussing tax, trade and the civil war in Syria. As the early-morning mists cleared to reveal sunny blue skies for the second day of the summit, Mr Cameron took a quick dip in the water before having his breakfast and joining his guests for the first working session of the day, on counter-terrorism. It was not immediately clear whether the other leaders, including Russian president Vladimir Putin who is known for his taste for macho outdoor sports, also took to the water. Chancellor George Osborne signalled that ‘concrete steps’ would be agreed at the G8 summit at Lough Erne in Enniskillen. He . warned that action was need on the ‘rules about tax that have been in . place for decades but, as the world has developed, haven't really kept . up’. He told BBC Breakfast: . ‘As a result, individuals can hide the taxes they are supposed to pay in . the international banking system and companies are able to shift their . profits around the globe, away from where those profits are actually . generated and therefore they don't pay tax. ‘That's really important because that is less money for our NHS and our schools and the things we need to invest in.’ He signalled that the plan being . pushed at G8 was focussed on rewriting international rules that allow . companies to shift their profits away from the UK or any other country . where they are doing business. A . key feature of the proposals on the table at Lough Erne is support for a . new regime of exchange of tax information, so that countries will be . able to know details of offshore accounts held by companies or . individuals overseas. Britain . is planning to take part in a pilot scheme later this year to trial the . new rules ahead of the introduction of new OECD standards, and wants to . sign up other countries. Mr . Cameron also wants greater transparency about so-called ‘beneficial . ownership’ to make clear who is the ultimate owner of a company and make . it more difficult to operate ‘shell companies’ which often carry out no . business activity, but exist only to hide the true source of income . from tax authorities. Britain . has often been seen as an international black sheep on tax havens, . thanks to the practices in its overseas territories and crown . dependencies like Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Jersey, Guernsey and the . Isle of Man. But Mr Osborne . said their agreement in London on Saturday to accept the new OECD code . showed the UK was ‘putting our house in order’. Meeting: Mr Cameron has been at pains to stress the informality of talks at the summit . Middle man: Mr Cameron found himself seated between Mr Putin and Mr Obama who last night staged an uneasy press conference where divisions over Syria were laid bare . Transparency: Mr Cameron has placed a heavy emphasis on securing a global agreement on cracking down on tax avoidance . Anti-poverty campaigners have welcomed Mr Cameron's decision to focus the G8 agenda during Britain's year-long presidency on tax transparency, arguing that it is the poorest countries in the world which lose out most from individuals and companies secreting their wealth in offshore boltholes. However, Adrian Lovett, Europe executive director at development campaign group One, warned that any agreement on the exchange of tax information must include the developing world, and not just the rich nations of the G8. And he called for public registries of tax information, to allow investigations not only by tax authorities but also by campaign groups and the media. ‘The G8 must also ensure that the system they put in place for sharing tax information involves developing countries from the start,’ said Mr Lovett. ‘By taking these steps, the G8 will not only put its own house in order, but do so in ways that help the fight against extreme poverty. The UK must continue to lead the way and lobby its G8 partners, with no let-up in pace or ambition. G8 leaders must decide whether they want to shape the transparency revolution or resist the tide of history.’","World's most powerful leaders line up for group shot at Lough Erne .

Troubleshooters: Sir Michael Wilshaw, chief inspector of schools, wants to best teachers to go into the worst schools . Hit squads of top teachers and headteachers should be employed directly by the government and parachuted into failing schools, Ofsted’s chief inspector said today. Experienced staff with a proven track record of success could transform children’s prospects, Sir Michael Wilshaw believes. The trouble shooters would be drawn from Teaching Schools, which were set up two years ago to train top graduates. They would be targeted at areas which have been identified as the worst-performing in the country. Sir Michael said: 'We’re calling these teachers ""national service teachers"". These would be a tranche of teachers identified – not newly-qualified teachers, people who are working in schools that we know to be good teachers. 'We’re suggesting to government that they contract with government and are then directed to these schools where children are failing, for a period of time, incentivised to do so – financially incentivised to do so – and also then given the chance to move on when they’ve proved themselves…fast-tracked into leadership positions,' he told BBC Radio 4. Sir Michael has already revealed that a report he is publishing today, Access and Achievement, will show inner city areas are no longer hotbeds of under-achievement among pupils. Instead, the problem has shifted to deprived coastal towns and rural areas, as well as ‘sinking schools’, often in areas of relative affluence. Sir Michael added: 'Where the problems now are is in schools – good schools, outstanding schools – in county areas, with small proportions of poor children who are doing extremely badly. 'The worst place that we found for a poor child to be educated in England is in West Berkshire; not exactly the sort of place you’d expect. 'West Berkshire is a place where poor children do badly in the primary sector, in the secondary sector, and in post-16 in rural areas, like Norfolk and Suffolk, in Lincolnshire and coastal areas, Hastings and so on. We need to think carefully about what we’re doing to do in these situations.' White working-class boys are also the most likely to leave education with few or no decent qualifications now instead of ethnic minorities. Rural: Sir Michael said that leafy West Berkshire was the worst place for a poor child to be educated in England . In a speech Sir Michael said: ‘Today, many of the disadvantaged children performing least well in school can be found in leafy suburbs, market towns or seaside resorts. Often they are spread thinly, as an ‘invisible minority’ across areas that are relatively affluent. ‘These poor, unseen children can be found in mediocre schools the length and breadth of our country. They are labelled, buried in lower sets, consigned as often as not to indifferent teaching. ‘They coast through education until - at the earliest opportunity - they sever their ties with it. ‘The most important factor in reversing these trends is to attract and incentivise the best people to the leadership of underperforming schools in these areas. ‘This may require government to work with Teaching Schools to identify and incentivise experienced and effective teachers to work in less fashionable, more remote or challenging places. The concept of a National Service Teacher should be considered.’ An Ofsted insider last night said details of how the scheme would work had not been drawn up, although the idea is they would be ‘employed and funded by central government’. It leaves open the prospect of teams of top teachers being sent in to turn around struggling schools or individuals taking long-term placements. Sir Michael has already said the report will recommend a series of regional initiatives that will improve weak areas by focusing on leadership and mentoring by leading schools. A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘We will consider Ofsted’s recommendations and respond in due course.’","Sir Michael Wilshaw warns of 'poor, unseen children in mediocre schools'

Attacker: Nicholas Onofrio, 52, walked free from court despite being a 'high risk of serious harm' to girls . A children's disco DJ walked free from court despite sexually abusing a 15-year-old girl in bushes after a judge said his crime was not serious enough for jail. Nicholas Onofrio, 52, attacked the teenager outside a roller disco party he was DJing at in Littlehampton, West Sussex, last year. But, despite branding him a 'high risk of serious harm' to girls, Mr Justice Mackay said unpaid work was punishment enough for the unrepentant sex offender. Leaving the court with a group of supporters, Onofrio hid his face from photographers, while one of his companions stuck her middle finger up at the camera and others smirked. The mobile phone shop manager, who calls himself DJ Nicko and claims to have done nothing wrong, pounced on the girl when he went outside for a cigarette during the roller disco. As her friends and other youngsters partied inside, Onofrio invited the girl to look into some bushes, then grabbed her and began fondling her breasts and inner thigh, the Royal Courts of Justice heard. He told her: 'I can't wait until all those girls in there are 16, because I want to **** them so hard'. She eventually managed to break free from his grasp and get to safety. She did not tell anyone until she confided in a schoolfriend a couple of days later, but has since been shunned by some of her former best friends, the court heard. 'She lost what most young women regard as the most important part of their lives, the close friendship of other girls of their age,' said Mr Justice Mackay. Offensive: One of Nick Onofrio's supporters makes an obscene gesture as he leaves the court (Onofrio is in the blue jacket) Abuser: Nicholas Onofrio, 52, who fondled the girl in some bushes outside the disco in Littlehampton . Onofrio, who is in a long-term relationship,appeared for sentencing had denied sexual activity with a child at Lewes Crown Court, but was convicted by a jury in May. Although the trial was heard in East Sussex, the sentencing happened in London as that is where the judge is currently sitting. Let off: Mr Justice Mackay ruled that the offence was not serious enough for a jail term . After the trial, the defendant was assessed by a probation officer, who said in a 'disturbing' report that he still poses a 'high risk of serious harm to adolescent females', the judge said. 'I am concerned about the risk you pose on a continuing basis to girls and young women on occasions such as these,' he continued. But, because the activity did not go beyond a low level of seriousness, prison was not necessary, he said. 'In view of the nature of the conduct you had with her, interrupted as you may have been, this isn't sufficiently serious as to warrant a custodial sentence.' The judge imposed a community order with 18 months' supervision and ordered Onofrio, of Littlehampton, to do 100 hours of unpaid work. He also passed a sexual offences prevention order, banning him from unsupervised contact with children other than with their parents' consent. 'I am satisfied it is necessary to protect such persons from serious harm because it is the view of the writer of the pre-sentence report, and it is my view, that you present a high risk of such harm to adolescent girls,' said the judge.","Nicholas Onofrio fondled the girl in some bushes outside a roller disco .

The reclusive widow of a wealthy property tycoon is battling her two stepsons in court over her share of her late husband's £7million fortune. Clive Zola Berger warned his sons that he would be 'watching' from beyond the grave to ensure they did not clash with their stepmother Rosana Berger after his death. But Mrs Berger, 84, who barely leaves her £4.25million Surrey mansion, says her requests for more money from her husband's estate have been met with 'stony silence'. Rosana Berger is locked in a court dispute with her two stepsons over her share of her late husband's fortune . She said her husband wanted her to live the rest of her days in comfort. However, she claims her income is not enough to cover the cost of maintaining eight-bedroom Abbotswood, in Godalming and its 30 acres. Mrs Berger said she also needs more money to cover the £33,000 a year she pays her domestic help. She is now asking the courts to effectively re-write her husband's will to ensure that 'reasonable provision' is made for her in her autumn years. However, her stepsons, Julian and Jonathan Berger, both high-powered solicitors, deny she has been hard done by and say her claim to need an income of over £220,000-a-year is over the top. Mrs Berger was told by a judge last year that she had left it too late to make her claim, but Lord Justice Lloyd has now opened a new chapter in the dispute by granting her permission to mount a full Appeal Court challenge to that decision. Penelope Reed QC, for Mrs Berger, said her husband, a solicitor turned property mogul, meant for his second wife to have a 'substantial' income after his death in June, 2005. In a letter written his son Julian before his . death, Mr Berger pleaded: 'Make absolutely sure that the estate is . not involved in the arguments and problems that can so often arise in . probate. I shall be watching.' The family's dispute has reached the Court of Appeal despite Clive Berger's pleas to his sons not to allow arguments between them and his warning that he will 'be watching' from beyond the grave . The couple both had children from . previous relationships, lived together for 36 years and she helped to . raise her step-children from a young age, the court heard. Her husband's will directed that she be . allowed to stay in Abbotswood rent free for life. He also left her his . 50 per cent stake in their £1.2million home in Arizona, which she has . since sold, placing the proceeds in a U.S. trust for tax reasons, the QC . added. Her children also received property. The remainder of the estate - largely made up of at least £2.9million worth of shares in property company, Circle Land Ltd - was put into a trust, with Mr Berger issuing instructions that it be used to 'maximise' his widow's income for life. Mrs Berger, who suffers from arthritis and angina, says dividends from the company are not enough. 'The result is that her capital has been steadily depleting,' Miss Reed told the court. The widow, who says she lives 'largely as a recluse', hopes to sell Abbotswood - and replace it with a flat worth up to £3million in west London's upmarket Bayswater, the court heard. And it is hoped that any money left over after a replacement property is found could be used to supplement her income - but that is only if Abbotswood sells for its massive valuation. Mrs Berger rarely leaves her eight-bedroom mansion in the leafy Surrey market town of Godalming (pictured) The widow claims that, when she told her stepsons she needed more money, she was 'met with a stony silence'. They insist their stepmother's income demands are excessive and that she would have had ample funds if profits from the sale of the Arizona property were not tied up in a trust. Judge Rodger Hayward Smith QC threw out Mrs Berger's bid to up her income last year on the basis that her case had been brought to court almost six years outside the normal six-month time limit, running from the date on which the will was admitted to probate. Her stepsons - one a director of Circle Land and the other a 'de facto director' - had decided to plough much of the firm's income into refurbishing its property portfolio. And the judge observed: 'Such a long-term investment strategy is likely to be of considerable benefit to Julian and Jonathan on Mrs Berger's death. It is now and likely to remain of little benefit to her unless she lives to a very great age'. Judge Hayward Smith said that Mrs Berger had enjoyed 'a high standard of living' before her husband's death but described her request for an income of £222,540-a-year from his estate as 'very inflated'. Giving her permission to appeal, however, Lord Justice Lloyd said: 'There seems to be a reasonable prospect of success, given the position of Mrs Berger as a widow.' Her full appeal will be heard by three Appeal Court judges at a later date.","Clive Zola Berger warned sons he was 'watching' from beyond the grave .

Anthony Reading, 26, now has no excuse for forgetting either Tyler or Joey's birthdays because they were all born on June 8. Anthony, from Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, was amazed when he welcomed his first son Tyler into the world exactly 24 years to the day since his own birth. Triple celebration: Anthony Reading, 26, with his two sons Tyler, aged two, right, and Joey on the day that he was born. All three celebrate their birthday on June 8 . Originally due at the end of May, the youngster actually arrived two weeks late but perfectly in time to share his father's special day. Having had a double celebration for the past two years, the 26-year-old then went on to defy astounding odds and make the day a triple celebration after his second son Joey was born, like his father and brother, on June 8. Dr Adam Johansen, at University of Warwick, said the odds of two children being born with the same birthday as their father were 133,224-1. 'If you assume these things are completely independent, then the probability that the father's first son is born on the same day as him is one in 365,' he said. 'The probability of his second son being born on the same day is again one in 365. You then have to multiply the two figures together to give you odds of 133,224 to one that all three are born on the same day.' Birthday brothers: Tyler, aged two years, holds his new baby brother Joey. They were both born on the same day, June 8 . Father and son: Anthony Reading holds his newborn son Joey. The father was expecting the baby to be born on June 6, but he actually arrived two days late . Anthony said: 'Having a child is a wonderful thing and I felt really blessed when Tyler was born healthy and happy back in 2011. 'The icing on the cake was the fact he came along on my birthday as it meant we would always be able to celebrate the day together. 'Unfortunately things didn't work out with Tyler's mum but we have stayed in contact and are still really good friends, which means I see him regularly.' He has since found happiness with current partner Katy Porter and the pair could barely believe it when baby Joey showed up on both Anthony and Tyler's birthday less than two weeks ago. Happy family: Anthony Reading, his partner Katy Porter, and their newborn baby Joey . Talking about receiving his second unexpected birthday present, Anthony, who works night shifts at Asda, added: 'Joey was actually due on July 6 so myself and Katy never really thought there would be a chance of us all being born on the same day. 'It seems Joey had other ideas though and he ended up coming four weeks prematurely on both Tyler and my birthday. 'We were both completely stunned and pretty much everyone who I have told since thinks I'm joking or trying to wind them up because it's so unbelievable. 'After he was born, Joey suffered from jaundice and had to undergo a lot of tests before he was allowed to leave the hospital but now he is back at home and we're enjoying every minute. 'I couldn't ask for anything more than to share my birthday with my two favourite boys. A day that was already special has become even more so now. It's the best present in the world and more than I could ever ask for.'

A hard-line Muslim cleric has received an 11-year suspended sentence after tearing up and burning a Bible in front of the U.S. Embassy in Egypt. Ahmed Abdullah ripped up the Bible during a September 11 rally by ultraconservative Salafi Muslims in Cairo who were protesting against an anti-Islam film . produced in the U.S. During the sentencing at Cairo's Nasr City court, his son was also given a suspended sentence of eight years for the same incident. It was a rare prosecution over attacks on faiths other than Islam in Egypt. Over the past two years, attacks by extremist Muslims against followers of other religions, mostly Christians, have been on the increase. Abdullah, also known as Abu Islam, has . become known for hate speeches against Coptic Christians in his preaching. Last year, he launched a new Islamic TV channel that is run primarily by . women covered from head to toe with only their eyes showing. He is a . frequent guest on other TV channels. According to Egyptian law, showing contempt toward Christianity, Islam and Judaism known as 'heavenly' religions is a crime. Lawyers and rights groups complain the definition of contempt of religion is vague and has been used most often against critics of Islam. Blasphemy charges were not uncommon in Egypt under ousted president Hosni Mubarak, but there has been a surge in such cases in recent months. The trend is widely seen as a reflection of the growing power and confidence of Islamists, after election victories by the Muslim Brotherhood and strong showings by the Salafis, who practice a form of the religion as they believe it existed around the seventh century. Writers, activists and a television . comedian have recently been charged with blasphemy, but Christians seem . to be the favourite target of Islamist prosecutors. Abdullah's case . brought a rare sentence against a Muslim cleric. Demonstrations: Abdullah ripped up a Bible and burned it during a September 11 rally.

Abdullah and his son were also ordered to pay a fine of 5,000 Egyptian pounds (£446). The ruling can be appealed.","Ahmed Abdullah ripped up a Bible .

For more than 40 years it has gently chugged along giving joy rides to generations of delighted children. But last week the model railway at Barshaw Park in Paisley, Scotland, was brought to an abrupt standstill at the insistence of health and safety bosses. Excited youngsters who had flocked for the park's annual Gala Day were ordered off the miniature train moments before it was about to depart because council bureaucrats say the genteel attraction does not have the necessary certification. All change: The miniature railway has been popular with young children and families for generations but now requires a health and safety certificate . Despite Paisley Model Engineering Society having safely operated the railway without incident since the 1970s, Renfrewshire Council now says the tracks must be subject to an 'independent inspection'. Society member Alan Wallace accused the council of being heavy-handed and said the safety certificate they had been asked to produce was the kind expected of 'high-speed, money-making fairground rides'. He said: 'We have been running the railway for over 40 years without incident but now the council needs to see a certificate stating that it is safe. 'It would appear that council . officials are requiring the same level of certification as that required . for high-speed, money-making fairground rides.' He . added: 'We would like to apologise to kids, of all ages, who hoped to . have a ride on the miniature railway as part of their gala day outing. 'We especially want to apologise to the passengers who were ordered off the train just before its departure.' Heavy-handed: Society member Alan Wallace accused the council of asking for the kind of certification required by high-speed fairground rides . Local councillor Brian Lawson pointed out that the Model Engineering . Society is covered by public liability insurance and maintains the . railway equipment to meet with Health and Safety Executive (HSE) guidelines. He said: . 'While I appreciate the need to ensure public safety, I have to ask why . this was not sorted out long before the gala day. 'I hope everyone concerned can put their heads together and get the Barshaw train back on the rails as soon as possible. 'It would be a terrible loss to generations of Paisley people if they were to lose the train.' Local authority chiefs defended the decision to put . the brakes on the gala day railway fun.

Angry demonstrations and clashes with riot police have taken place in Brazil's biggest cities after more than 200,000 people protested over the expense of the 2014 football World Cup. In the largest protests seen in Brazil for more than 20 years, more than 100,000 people alone took to the streets of Rio de Janeiro.

The protests yesterday come after the opening . matches of football's Confederations Cup over the weekend, just one month . before a papal visit, a year before the World Cup and three years ahead . of the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. The Brazilian government is spending billions to host the football World Cup and the Olympics. However, many Brazilians have been left frustrated by heavy tax burdens and claim they are receiving woeful returns in public education, health, security and . transportation.

Wrecked: This bank of cash machines in Rio de Janeiro were destroyed by protesters . In Sao Paulo, Brazil's economic hub, . at least 65,000 protesters gathered at a small, treeless plaza then . broke into three directions in a Carnival atmosphere, with drummers . beating out samba rhythms as the crowds chanted anti-corruption jingles. They also focused on the cause that initially sparked the protests last week - a 10-cent hike in bus and subway fares. Violence . was seen in Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte and the southern city of . Porto Alegre. Police clashed with clusters of protesters in those . cities, at times using tear gas to disperse them. Injured: A policeman lies injured on the ground after clashing with demonstrators . Concern: The protests took place a year before the World Cup and three years ahead of the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. The policeman is helped after being attacked . Vandalism: Protesters break into a sandals' store as the protests begin to escalate . In Rio, about 50 protesters tried to . break into the state assembly building before being driven off. In Porto . Alegre, some protesters set a bus on fire and threw rocks at empty . commuter trains. On . the roof of the congress in Brasilia, dozens of protesters clasped . hands and raised their arms, the light from below sending their . elongated shadows onto the structure's large, hallmark upward-turned . bowl designed by famed architect Oscar Niemeyer. Some . congressional windows were broken, but police did not use force to . contain the damage. Rarely since the end of the 1964-1985 dictatorship . has Brazil seen protests of such size. Anger: A demonstrator with the national flag protests against the soccer Confederation's Cup and the government of Brazil's President Dilma Rousseff in Brasilia . Peaceful: Hundreds of people protest on the roof of the national congress against rising public transport costs in Brasilia . 'This is a communal cry saying: . 'We're not satisfied,'' Maria Claudia Cardoso said on a Sao Paulo . avenue, taking turns waving a sign reading '(hash)revolution' with her . 16-year-old son, Fernando, as protesters streamed by. 'We're . massacred by the government's taxes - yet when we leave home in the . morning to go to work, we don't know if we'll make it home alive because . of the violence,' she added. 'We . don't have good schools for our kids. Our hospitals are in awful shape. Corruption is rife. These protests will make history and wake our . politicians up to the fact that we're not taking it anymore!'

Flames: In Porto Alegre demonstrators build a bonfire to impede the arrival of the police . Rising: Demonstrators shout slogans during a protest in front of the Brazilian National Congress in Brasilia . The unrest is raising some security concerns, especially after protests last week in Sao Paulo and over the weekend in Rio produced injury-causing clashes with police. Protest leaders went to pains to tell marchers that damaging public or private property would only hurt their cause. In Sao Paulo, sentiments were at first against the protests last week after windows were broken and buildings spray painted during the demonstrations. Police, too, changed tactics. In Sao Paulo, commanders said publicly before the protest they would try to avoid violence, but warned they could resort to force if protesters destroyed property. Masses: A long exposure shot shows a group of people participate in a protest against rising public transport costs in Rio de Janeiro . Gathering: The demonstrations in Rio de Janeiro were largely peaceful . Masked: A protestor walks through the streets of Rio . During the first hours of the march that continued into the night there was barely any perceptible police presence. The Sao Paulo march itself was a family oriented affair: A group of mothers received a rousing cheer when they arrived at the plaza where the march began, brandishing signs that said 'Mothers Who Care Show Support.' 'I'm here to make sure police don't hurt these kids,' said Sandra Amalfe, whose 16-year-old daughter chatted with friends nearby. 'We need better education, hospitals and security - not billions spent on the World Cup.' Officers in Rio fired tear gas and rubber bullets when a group of protesters invaded the state legislative assembly and hurled things at police. But most of the tens of thousands who protested in Rio did so peacefully, many of them dressed in white and brandishing placards and banners. Many people in the city left work early to avoid traffic jams downtown. In Belo Horizonte, police estimated about 20,000 people joined a peaceful crowd protesting before a Confederations Cup match between Tahiti and Nigeria as police helicopters buzzed overhead and mounted officers patrolled the stadium area. Meeting point: Protestors gather at the Municipal theater during a march in Rio de Janeiro . Anger: A car burns during a protest in downtown Rio de Janeiro . Earlier in the day, demonstrators erected several barricades of burning tires on a nearby highway, disrupting traffic. Protests also were reported in Curitiba, Belem and Salvador. Marcos Lobo, a 45-year-old music producer who joined the protest in Sao Paulo, said the actions of police during earlier demonstrations persuaded him to come out Monday. 'I thought they (the protests) were infantile at first because of my preconceived notions,' Lobo said. 'Then I saw the aggression.' Another protester, Manoela Chiabai, said she wanted to express her dissatisfaction with the status quo. 'Everything in Brazil is a mess. There is no education, health care - no security. The government doesn't care,' the 26-year-old photographer said. 'We're a rich country with a lot of potential but the money doesn't go to those who need it most.' In a brief statement, President Dilma Rousseff, who faces re-election next year and whose popularity rating recently dipped for the first time in her presidency, acknowledged the protests, saying: 'Peaceful demonstrations are legitimate and part of democracy. It is natural for young people to demonstrate.' Disgruntlement: Demonstrators shout slogans on the ramp of the Brazilian National Congress during protests in Brasilia . Pain: An injured demonstrator sits in a police van after he was arrested during a protest in Brasilia . Ariadne Natal, a professor at the University of Sao Paulo whose research focuses on violence, said protesters want to 'take advantage of this moment when we have foreign visitors, when the world's press is watching, to showcase their cause.' 'The problem we've seen is that the police action is trying to prevent these protests,' she said. 'What we need to figure out is how the protests as well as the big events can be carried out democratically.' Brazilians have long accepted malfeasance as a cost of doing business, whether in business or receiving public services. Brazilian government loses more than $47 billion each year to undeclared tax revenue, vanished public money and other widespread corruption, according to the Federation of Industries of Sao Paulo business group. But in the last decade, about 40 million Brazilians have moved into the middle class and they have begun to demand more from government. Trouble: Police arrest youths for vandalism in Belem, Para State . Barricade: Protesters, one holding a Brazilian flag, burn trash to block a street in Rio de Janeiro . Many are angry that billions of dollars in public funds are being spent to host the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics while few improvements are made elsewhere. Protests are routine in Brazil, but few turn violent. Security experts say the demonstrations aren't the main danger for the hundreds of thousands of visitors who will descend on Brazil from now through the Olympics in 2016. However, Joe Biundini, whose FAM International Group provides security details to executives attending the Confederations Cup, said there is a danger of escalating violence from the protests if authorities don't negotiate with demonstrators. 'If the government doesn't sit down with them it could get worse in future matches,' Biundini said.","Protests are largest seen in Brazil for more than 20 years .

The Georgia parents of a two-year-old girl killed along with 12 other children and six adults at a Qatar shopping mall fear the truth behind the blaze will never be known. Authorities in the richest country in the world have reneged on their promise to share findings from a government report into the fire at the Villaggio shopping mall in Doha in May last year. They also failed to include the report as evidence in the trial of seven people including the nursery owners, four mall managers and an inspector from Qatar's Ministry of Business and Trade, who were charged with negligence and failing to adhere to safety regulations. Tragedy: Zaier Aouani and Grace O with their daughter, Zeinah Aouani, at the Villaggio mall in Doha, Qatar, where the two-and-a-half-year-old was killed . A verdict in what has been described as a show trial is expected on Thursday, but . Zaier Aouani, who was teaching at Qatar University at the . time of the fire, is pessimistic that there will be justice for his daughter Zeinah's death. 'I’m not confident,' Mr Aouani told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. 'The entire system has failed us.' His wife, Grace O, who watched . helplessly as fire swept through the mall, trapping her daughter and . other children in the nursery, added: 'Everyone says it’s a trial for show.' Parents of other children who were . trapped in the Gympanzee nursery and died in the fire, have also . complained about a lack of information from Qataris. 'It’s been a deafening silence,' Martin Weekes, whose triplets were killed in the fire, said. 'We don’t . know what happened. We don’t know if any improvements have been made.' An investigation into the fire at the mall found a 'lack of adherence to required laws, systems, and measure . by all concerned parties to different degree[s]. This includes adherence . to design, license, and safety conditions, which contributed to [the] Villaggio catastrophe.' It is believed the fire was started . by a short circuit in a fluorescent light in the storeroom of a Nike . shop. A civil defense officer told Al Jazeera that the toxic paint used . to paint the mall, which is made to look like Venice complete with a sky . mural throughout, caused the fire and smoke to spread. Zeinah and the other children left at . the nursery, which was up a single flight of stairs, were trapped and . killed by the noxious smoke. Heartbreaking: Zeinah Aouani, aged two-and-a-half, from Atlanta, Georgia, died when the blaze swept through a mall . The hearing to determine criminal . responsibility for the fire had previously been postponed four times . before all seven defendants showed up to court. However, the local media in have been . prevented from publishing details from the trial until the verdict, . according to the Doha Centre for Media Freedom. A Civil Defence officer told the . hearing that Villaggio has been repeatedly fined for using a highly . flammable paint in its mall decorations, which, when ignited, causes . fire to spread quickly and is difficult to contain, according to TVNZ. It was also noted that sprinklers . that could have stopped the smoke did not appear to be functioning and . Villaggio officials had not responded to requests to perform maintenance . on the equipment. Zeinah's parents believe the little girl's death could have been prevented. Witnesses said when the fire alarm went off in the mall, security guards assured shoppers it was a false alarm. Firefighters were also slow to respond, arriving almost an hour after witnesses first spotted smoke above the mall. Firefighter Abdel . Khaleq al Huwari, who was one of the first . to go into the blazing building, said the emergency services were not . told there was a nursery in the mall until half an hour after they . arrived. Devastated: Eyes swollen from weeping, the Weekes parents supported each other at a memorial service the day after the fire . Grieving: Friends did their best to console Martin and Jane Weekes during the service at Doha's Aspire Park . Martin and Jane Weekes, whose two-year-old triplets Lillie, Jackson and Willsher died in the Gympanzee nursery, said: 'We want an understanding of what actually went wrong and how to ensure it never happens again. 'We . all want answers and accountability ... It won't bring back our loved . ones, but it will help to ensure this can never happen again.' Ms O, from Atlanta, had been visiting . her husband in Qatar while he was working at a university at the time . of the fire. After hearing about the fire she rushed to the mall but . said she was forced to watch helplessly while her daughter was trapped . inside. 'I could see really thick black smoke . was coming out of the mall,' she said. But . authorities would not allow her into the building, telling her: 'Your . kid is safe inside.' 'I even told one firefighter, ""I can give you money"",' she said. 'Please . go check the nursery. They just looked at me like a crazy person who . doesn’t know what’s going on.' The couple have hired lawyers and . turned to senator Johnny Isakson's office for help, but have not yet . received the answers they are looking for. 'We’re not going to stop until we get that report,' Ms O said. The . couple had no idea if their daughter was among the children until a . reporter led them to a hospital where most of the bodies had been taken . to. There, the couple were shown photographs of all the dead children. 'At the hospital, when we . went to the mortuary, they showed us pictures of dead kids. All the kids . from the nursery were dead. They just asked me, ""Is this your kid, Is . this your kid?"" My kid was the last one.' Zeinah's body had no burn marks, which her family say is a sign her death could have been prevented. Misled: Smoke began billowing from the roof of the mall, but witnesses claim security guards told shoppers it was simply a false alarm . Tragedy: The fire quickly took hold, yet some shoppers have claimed that fire alarms failed to go off, or were barely audible . 'Fire . can happen. This death of kids and teachers could have been prevented. The death of everyone could have been prevented,' Ms O said. 'There is such incompetence that it makes me angry right now. But I'm so sad. So sad.' Critics said that the government of the oil-rich nation, run by the . Al Thani ruling family, is trying to cover up the findings as it . prepares to host the World Cup in 2022. The fire also came as the country was . forced to counter criticism about its poor human rights record. More . than 85 per cent of the population in the tiny country is made up of . foreign nationals. Rescue: Firefighters climb on the roof of the mall to try to rescue children trapped inside . While all foreign workers are . subjected to forced blood tests, X-rays and finger printing, and cannot . leave the country without a signed permit from their employer, the . workers used to keep up with the rapid construction of apartment blocks, . offices and malls are also forced to work long hours in intense heat and on sites with poor safety records, according to . Human Rights Watch. 'Qatar has been quite successful at . giving off a progressive image when, in fact, the [labor] system is . exploitative,' Nicholas McGeehan, of Human Rights Watch, told CNN. 'It is the same old story.

"By . Steve Robson . PUBLISHED: . 08:20 EST, 20 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:54 EST, 20 June 2013 . A car showroom receptionist stole more than £544,000 from customers after promising to find them cut-price luxury cars - but barely made a penny from the scam. June Hoystead, 52, from Cantley, Doncaster, sourced BMWs, Minis and Land Rovers for friends claiming she could use her staff discount to get cars at up to half the normal price. But bizarrely, it emerged the claim was a lie and in fact she was having to pay full price. Jailed: June Hoystead promised friends she could get cheap deals on cars but the claim was a lie . Sheffield Crown Court heard Hoystead was unable to admit the truth and kept promising large number of cars for clients and taking more money to cover her losses. When the scheme finally unravelled and police were called, they discovered six customers were £544,585 out of pocket. One man alone lost £288,000 after handing Hoystead £316,000 to buy 67 cars and only receiving three. In total she ordered 133 vehicles for the six complainants who handed her £730,000 but only 16 were delivered. Despite the sums involved, there was no . evidence Hoystead had spent the proceeds on anything apart from a . few clothes and a couple of budget holidays, the court was told. Hoystead admitted six counts of fraud and was jailed for two years yesterday. Andrew Smith, defending, said: 'This is, . to say the least, a series of offending which has the most unusual . features. There is no pot of gold here.' Peer pressure: Hoystead was working as a receptionist at a Citroen dealership in Doncaster when she began promising friends she could get cheap deals on luxury cars . The offences happened between April, 2010 and November, 2011 when she worked for the Evans Halshaw Citroen franchise in Doncaster. Her scam began when she bought a £15,000 Toyota Avensis for her brother but he went to Afghanistan and did not need it. So she sold the car to Des Bennett for £7,000 making an £8,000 loss and from then on tried to cover her losses, said Laura Marshall, prosecuting. She told him she was able to obtain new cars at knockdown prices by using her staff discount or pooling it with other members of staff to get bargains. Mr Bennett was so impressed he ordered 67 cars from her and deposited £316,000 in her bank accounts. Word soon spread about the cheap vehicles and Pouran Singh gave her £133,950 and placed an order for 50 cars. Martin Blagden ordered four cars at a cost of £98,500 and Eric Smith deposited £131,085 for another 14 cars. Adrian Stockdale paid £51,000 for four cars while taxi driver Tariq Aziz handed over £6,000 for a new car. But it was all a con. Miss Marshall said: 'Hoystead never received any discount on any of the vehicles purchased. They were bought at full price.' The scheme unravelled when most of the cars were not delivered and questions were asked. Miss Marshall said Hoystead, who has a partner and a son at university, received £730,000 from the six customers whose total losses were £544,585. It emerged that more than £839,000 had passed through her bank accounts from March, 2008 to February, 2012. Fraud: Hoystead had told friends she could get luxury cars such as Land Rover's for up to half price with her staff discount . When arrested by police she said she had promised to get the cars for her customers but realised she could not get them cut-price. She felt under pressure, particularly from Mr Bennett who after his bargain buy asked her for 'more and more' cars. 'He began to deposit large amounts to pay for those vehicles but she was unable to get those cars,' said Miss Marshall. 'She needed more money to cover the losses and others became involved.' Mr Smith said in a victim impact statement: 'I feel humiliated that I have been taken in like this.' Mr Aziz, who has a wife and two children said: 'It's a lot of money to me. I thought it was an honest deal.' Mr Singh received ten cars, Mr Bennett three cars, Mr Blagden, Mr Smith and Mr Stockdale one car each, while Mr Aziz got nothing. The court heard that other customers received cut-price cars from Hoystead but have not complained to the police. He went on: 'I have to acknowledge that honest people have lost a considerable amount of money. But some were happy with what happened. They approached this lady and bought cars from her at half the price they would have cost you or me. 'It does beg the question as to what they thought was going on here when a receptionist was able to promise time after time these cracking deals for cars.' He said every time she found a car and sold it cheap she was getting more and more into debt. 'This is a lady who is particularly vulnerable to pressure being brought to bear upon her.' When things spiraled out of control she could not say 'no'. He said: 'The amount of dishonesty is out of proportion to the losses here. She did not live the life of Riley.' Judge Paul Watson said Hoystead had glowing testimonials and ordinarily was a 'decent and caring mother.' She had not set out to be dishonest from the outset. 'It was one which grew and grew causing these extremely substantial losses,' he said. After the hearing Miss Marshall said: 'She thought these customers were her friends and she didn't want to let them down. She thought if she stopped she would lose their friendship.'","June Hoystead, 52, was a receptionist at Citroen dealership in Doncaster .

The United States will meet the Taliban in Doha in the coming days for talks aimed at achieving peace in Afghanistan, where American armed forces have battled insurgents for 12 years, U.S. officials said today. The U.S. said the Taliban will . issue a statement today opposing the use of Afghan soil for attacks on . other countries and that they support an Afghan peace process. The news came as the Afghan Taliban opened an office in . Qatar to help restart talks on ending the 12-year-old war, . saying it wanted a political solution that would bring about a just . government and end foreign occupation. Taliban officials held secret negotiations in Norway over the past few months that played a significant role in the opening of the Taliban's Qatari office, foreign minister Espen Barth Eide told state broadcaster NRK. Scroll down for video . Qatari Assistant Foreign Minister for Foreign Affairs Ali bin Fahad Al-Hajri (right) and Jan Mohammad Madani (left) one of the Taliban officials, officially open the Taliban Afghanistan Political Office in Doha, Qatar . The Taliban said today that they would open a 'political office' in Qatar's capital, Doha, to conduct peace talks on Afghanistan . The United States said it would hold talks with the Taliban at the group's newly opened an office . The United States will insist the . Taliban break ties with Al Qaeda, end violence, and accept the Afghan . constitution, including protection for women and minorities. It has already doused expectation . about peace, by warning it expects the talks to be lengthy. 'This is but . the first step in what will be a long road,' one U.S. official said . after the news was announced. In . another positive move for the war-torn country, Afghan President Hamid . Karzai announced today his country's armed forces are taking over the . lead for security nationwide from the NATO coalition. Afghan President Hamid Karzai speaking today following a security handover ceremony at a military academy outside Kabul . The handover of responsibility marks a turning point for American and NATO military forces, which will now move entirely into a supporting role. It also opens the way for their full withdrawal in 18 months. 'This is a historic moment for our country and from tomorrow all of the security operations will be in the hands of the Afghan security forces,' Karzai said at the ceremony, held at the new National Defense University built to train Afghanistan's future military officers. Karzai said that in the coming months, coalition forces will gradually withdraw from Afghanistan's provinces as the country's security forces replace them. In announcing the fifth and final phase . of a process that began at a November 2010 NATO summit in Lisbon, . Portugal, Karzai said 'transition will be completed and Afghan security . forces will lead and conduct all operations.' Could newly-announced U.S. talks with the Taliban end the conflict in Afghanistan after 12 years? NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said the coalition will help militarily if and when needed but will no longer plan, execute or lead operations. The handover in Afghanistan has been brought about by the growth of military training in the country since 2009. It has dramatically increased the size of the Afghan National Security Forces, bringing them up from 40,000 men and women six years ago to about 352,000 today. After transition, coalition troops will move entirely into a supporting role - training and mentoring, and in emergency situations providing the Afghans backup in combat, mainly in the form of airstrikes and medical evacuation. The Afghan Army has swelled in size since 2007, and now numbers more than 350,000 . 'Ten years ago, there were no Afghan national security forces. Five years ago, Afghan forces were a fraction of what they are today. Now you have 350,000 Afghan troops and police. A formidable force. And time and again, we have seen them dealing quickly and competently with complex attacks. Defeating the enemies of Afghanistan, and defending and protecting the Afghan people,' Rasmussen said. Afghans will now have the lead for security in all 403 districts of Afghanistan's 34 provinces. Until now, they were responsible for 312 districts nationwide, where 80 per cent of Afghanistan's population of nearly 30 million lives. Afghan security forces were until now carrying out 90 per cent of military operations around the country. Foreign forces will continue to support Afghans on the battlefield when they require it, but the Afghan army and police will be responsible for planning and leading military operations against the insurgency. 'As your forces step forward across the country, the main effort of our forces is shifting from combat to support. We will continue to help Afghan troops in operations if needed. But we will no longer plan, execute or lead those operations. And by the end of 2014, our combat mission will be completed. At that time, Afghanistan will be fully secured by Afghans,' Rasmussen said. Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai (left) shakes hands with NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen (right) during the handover ceremony . The handover paves the way for coalition forces - currently numbering about 100,000 troops from 48 countries, including 66,000 Americans - to leave. By the end of the year, the NATO force will be halved. At the end of 2014, all combat troops will have left and will replaced, if approved by the Afghan government, by a much smaller force that will only train and advise. President Barack Obama has not yet said how many soldiers he will leave in Afghanistan along with NATO forces, but it is thought that it would be about 9,000 U.S. troops and about 6,000 from its allies. Called 'Resolute Support,' Rasmussen said the goal of the new mission 'is to train, advise and assist Afghan forces. We will also play our part in the broader international efforts, to ensure the long-term sustainment of the Afghan security forces. This will be another visible demonstration that Afghanistan does not stand alone, now or in the future.' The U.S. and its allies have already pledged to fund the Afghan forces in the immediate years after 2015. This move could start the process of a full withdrawal of NATO troops from Afghanistan in 18 months . The handover was marred by a botched bomb attack against an Afghan politician in another part of Kabul. The bombing killed three civilians. Kabul deputy police chief Mohammad Daoud Amin said the blast was in the Pul-e-Surkh area of the western part of the city, which is miles (kilometers) away from the site of the handover ceremony attended by NATO chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen and Afghan President Hamid Karzai. The Taliban insurgency has been pressing an intense campaign of violence in the run-up to Today's security handover.","Talks will take place in new Doha offices to help secure peace .

Her dresses sell out within hours of her wearing them; her hairstyle is copied in salons across the country. But all those seeking to emulate the Duchess of Cambridge’s style no longer have to pore over photographs. They can simply consult Vogue’s complete guide to Kate. From the diameter of her curls to the number of teeth she shows when she smiles, nothing has escaped the fashion bible’s scrutiny. Ahead of her 31st birthday tomorrow, the magazine has analysed outfits the duchess has worn since her marriage to Prince William in April 2011, plus a handful from before the couple’s engagement – 100 in total. So to be a true copy Kate, you should wear blue, ensure the average drop of your earrings is 33mm – and carry your clutch bag with both hands. According to the guide, when it comes to her clothes, Kate’s favourite colour appears to be blue, which she has worn on 24 per cent of occasions. From peacock to Prussian, it is her out and out favourite. She also favours red (13 per cent) - which she wore for the occasion of the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee Pageant - followed by white (12 per cent) and, less popularly with the public, grey (11 per cent). Next on the list is purple (9 per cent), multi coloured or patterned outfits (eight per cent) pink ( seven per cent) and green ( six per cent). Cream and yellow both languish at the bottom of the league table on five per cent. By far and away most outfits worn on her last 100 official engagements come from top end High Street store LK Bennett - worn on 28 public engagements. But designer Alexander McQueen, whose outfits cost several thousand pounds apiece and who the Duchess chose to design her wedding dress, is her next favourite label with 14. Other designers in Kate’s top five are Jenny Packham (six), who has designed some of her most stunning evening dresses, and Temperley (eight). Once the high street Queen, Zara languishes at seven (probably because the firm have a huge store just a short hop from her home at Kensington Palace). But surprisingly Reiss, the label Kate wore to meet US President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle at Buckingham Palace, does not even register. Vogue have even made it their business to scrutinise the length of the Duchess’s sleeves - finding that 6:1 being the most commonly seen arm-to-sleeve-length ratio. ‘All the better to display the royal wrist-bling,’ it says. The magazine estimates that on her most recent tour of South East Asia and the Pacific, the Duchess took along 61 items of clothing, footwear and accessories worth around £1,427 per outfit (compared to the late Diana, Princess of Wales whose tour outfits costs the modern equivalent of £4,270 a pop). Kate’s other most talked-about asset is her glorious tumbling tresses and the magazine has even, unbelievably, worked out the average diameter of her curls - 25mm. The Duchess goes for a glossy ‘Chelsea blow dry’ 73.4 of the time - a perfectly achievable goal if one, like Kate, has a hairdresser on call 24 hours a day. Just like on her wedding day, she favours a chic half-up half-down do 13.6 per cent of the time, wearing it either naturally loose and curly or in a ponytail 6.5 per cent of occasions. Her accessories are equally closely monitored. Apparently the Duchess has perfected the tilt of her hats and fascinators - always to the right at a stylish 50 degree angle - to show off her enviable cheekbones. The average dimension of her favourite clutch bags is 194mm by 132 mm and she carried them as thus: one handed 31 per cent, left hand over right 15.5 per cent, right hand over left 5.5 per cent, hands together 48 per cent. Her favoured shoe designer is the upmarket Stuart Weitzman - sported on 13 public engagements out of the last 100 - closely followed by Jimmy Choo (well you would do, wouldn’t you?) at nine official events. The analysis found Kate favoured the colour blue, having been seen wearing it on 24 per cent of occasions, while green dresses only made it to six per cent . Even her earrings do not escape scrutiny - the average drop measuring exactly 33 mm. One of her favourites pairs is a glittering sapphire and diamond set once owned by William’s mother, the late Diana, Princess of Wales, who sported them on the cover of Vogue in July 1994. Seventeen years later, on her July 2011 official tour to Canada, Kate wore them in public again after having them slightly remodelled. Creams and yellow languish at the bottom of the table at five per cent, according to the study, which analysed everything including the length of her sleeves . Even her teeth do not escape the eagle eye of the fashionistas. Apparently the Duchess, who is believed to have had her teeth whitened and straightened by ‘micro-rotation’ - using invisible braces attached to the back of each tooth - shows an average of 8.6 teeth when she smiles. The February issue of Vogue is on sale from Thursday. The Duchess has developed into a fashion icon, as dresses sell out within hours of her wearing them and salons across the country are asked to emulate her hairstyle as analysed by Vogue- on sale Thursday .","To be a true copy of Kate, wear blue, carry your clutch bag with both hands and go for a glossy Chelsea blow dry .

Ex-footballer Trevor Francis today gave evidence in the trial of his son, who is accused of burgling a cottage on the property of former Aston Villa player Lee Hendrie. James Francis, 26, has denied stealing ladies' shoes, souvenir football shirts and other luxury goods from a cottage on the grounds of Mr Hendrie's £1.6 million mansion in Rowington, Warwickshire, in late May 2011. After confirming details of his football career to the court, Trevor Francis, the former Sheffield Wednesday and Birmingham City manager, who won 52 caps for England, said he would easily have been able to obtain signed football shirts from Premier League clubs. Two generations: James Francis (left) is accused of stealing souvenir football shirts . from Lee Hendrie's home. His father Trevor Francis says he could get the . shirt of any England player through his connections . The Sky Sports pundit, a friend of former England boss Fabio Capello and current national team manager Roy Hodgson, said: 'If I needed a shirt of any England player, it wouldn't be a problem - I could do that at any moment and the response would always be positive.' Francis, Britain's first ever £1 million footballer when he moved to Nottingham Forest in 1979, said he was also active in supporting several charities. Asked whether James, a player for Tamworth FC, had ever been in any sort of trouble, the 59-year-old replied: 'Both my boys were brought up what I would consider to be the correct way - with strong discipline. 'I was quite strict with them, they were always polite, well-mannered, and always knew when to say please and thank you. 'As you can imagine, this, what has happened, has been very, very difficult for the family. Lee Hendrie arrives at Warwickshire Justice Centre in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire yesterday. The cottage at the centre of the case is on his £1.7million property . 'I have known Lee Hendrie for a long, long time and that's what makes it so extraordinary. 'We are a very close family, a very loving family but it's been tough.' Earlier today James Francis told Warwick Crown Court he may have left two fingerprints found at the scene of an alleged burglary during a visit to assess how much it would cost to clean the property. Giving evidence in his defence, Francis said he had walked around inside the one-bed cottage, an outbuilding at Hendrie's £1.6 million mansion, in the summer of 2011. The Crown alleges that Francis, from Solihull, West Midlands, broke into the cottage while Hendrie and his wife were on holiday in Majorca between July 18 and August 3 2011. Addressing the jury on the third day of his trial, Francis said he had regarded Hendrie as being 'almost like an older brother' during his childhood. Denying that he had taken anything from Hendrie's home, Francis said he had been asked to give a quote for cleaning the mansion, formerly owned by Olympic gold-medallist showjumper Nick Skelton, after it had been rented out for a year. Answering questions from defence QC Michael Hubbard, Francis told the jury he and his parents had lived in one of two cottages adjoining the mansion, named Finwood Lawn, when it was owned by Mr Skelton. Describing how he assessed the cost of cleaning the house, Francis told the court: 'I knew there were outbuildings so I walked over to the first cottage and I noticed through the window that it was full of boxes.' The one-bedroom cottage is in the grounds of Mr Hendrie's sprawling £1.7million six-bedroom mansion (pictured) After deciding not to enter the first cottage, Francis said, he went into the second property, where the alleged burglary took place. 'It was heavily packed up with boxes,"" he told jurors. 'It was full of clutter on the floor which I had to move to navigate a path. There were clothes, cardboard boxes, just generally lots of clutter. 'There would have been many things I touched to navigate myself around... there were clothes on the floor and things like that.' Francis added that he had not been back to Finwood Lawn after May 26, 2011. During cross-examination by prosecutor Trevor Meegan, Francis said of Hendrie: 'We were close when I was much younger, but as I got older we did not see each other as much but we were still friends.' Trevor Francis (left) watched his son's trial from the public gallery yesterday. Police officers say fingerprints belonging to James Francis (right) were found at the scene . Denying that he had invented his . account to explain the presence of his fingerprints on a piece of . cardboard and a door panel found at the cottage, Francis said: 'I went . to the property to provide a quote for cleaning. 'I wasn't looking at the floor and inspecting what I should pick up. 'I moved a path to navigate myself . around the room. That is the only reason I can think of why my . fingerprints would have been on there.' Mr Hubbard also read a statement to . the jury in which Mr Skelton confirmed that James Francis and his . parents had been invited to stay at Finwood Lawn in the mid-2000s. Mr . Skelton's statement said of James Francis: 'He's an honest and a . well-mannered young man who was very respectful in every way whilst he . stayed at my property. 'He is a credit to his parents.'

Britain has been beaten by the spending bug again, buying more in May this year than since records began. Online shoppers help fuel a boom in retail sales, suggesting signs of economic recovery are giving people more confidence to spend their money. Food, clothes and household appliances were all up, as retailers bounced back from the unseasonably cold April. Record: Total sales figures jumped to record levels in May, as online shoppers and supermarket discounts persuaded people to spend . The boom for shops and internet retailers will provide a boost for George Osborne who last night struck a notably more upbeat tone on the economy. The Chancellor claimed that ‘Britain has left intensive care’ and ‘the economic news here in Britain has been better in recent months’. New figures show retail sales volumes increased 2.1 per cent in May month-on-month - significantly ahead of economists’ hopes for a 0.8 per cent increase. A price war at supermarkets lured shoppers to spend on food, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. The ONS added almost all store types reported a rebound in sales from April, which was hit by unseasonably cold weather. It said: ‘Feedback from retailers suggested that promotions on summer ranges led to this increase in sales.’ Upbeat: Chancellor George Osborne last night used his Mansion House speech to say Britain's economy was out of 'intensive care' Compared with a year earlier, retail sales volumes in May were up 1.9 per cent, as shoppers bought the biggest quantity of retail goods on record. The amount spent on retail goods also rose 2.1 per cent month-on-month and was up 3.1 per cent on a year earlier. Internet sales continued to soar, the ONS added, with spending increasing 10.3 per cent on a year earlier. Online sales now account for 9.7 per cent of retail spending. The amount of food bought increased by 3.5 per cent month-on-month, the ONS said, while sales of clothes, shoes and textiles rose 1.4 per cent on the month. Sales of household goods increased 0.7 per cent month-on-month. In his keynote Mansion House speech last night, Mr Osborne said: ‘The economy is growing. ‘Record numbers are in work. Surveys of confidence and future activity are stronger. Let me say tonight: the British economy is healing. ‘But while Britain has left intensive care, we still need to secure the recovery – and make sure we continue to treat the ailments that brought us low in the first place.’ Buoyant retail sales will add to signs of recovery in the economy, fuelling hopes the UK’s output can grow by 0.5 per cent in the second quarter. Martin Beck, UK economist at Capital Economics, said the figures are ‘further evidence that a recovery in the UK economy may be taking root’. Alan Clarke, fixed income strategy director at Scotiabank, said the UK was on a ‘food binge’ in May. ‘This volatility in retail sales is all about food,’ he said. ‘Either there was a big influence from the poor weather, the timing of Easter caused some distortions or the whole country was on a crash diet in April that was then reversed in May.’ Bargains: Big discounts in supermarkets lured shoppers to buy more food, the ONS said . David Tinsley, UK economist at BNP Paribas, said: ‘Overall, the figures today are consistent with a fairly solid quarterly gross domestic product (GDP) figure for the second quarter. ‘The question is whether this momentum can be sustained into the second half of the year. We remain concerned economy-wide real income growth will not be sufficient to see this, though for now the UK is having a good run.’ British Retail Consortium director general Helen Dickinson said optimism is gradually returning to the sector. She said: ‘UK retailers have had to work hard to respond to the volatile weather and economic challenges, but the signs are that their promotional activity has been paying off. ‘Customers remain price-conscious, but have been responding well to the good deals that are available.’","Total sales up 2.2 per cent month-on-month to the highest ever level .

A teenager who was once celebrated as a hero for saving his father's life has been arrested on suspicion of brutally stabbing his two elderly neighbors to death in their home. Daniel Marsh, 16, faces double homicide charges for allegedly torturing and stabbing attorney Oliver Northup, 87, and his wife Claudia Maupin, 76, to death in their Davis, California condominium in April. The arrest comes nearly four years after Marsh hit headlines for taking the steering wheel of his father's car as the man had a near-fatal heart attack. After veering the car to safety, he then hit his father's chest to restart his heart. Arrest: Daniel Marsh, 16, allegedly fatally stabbed his neighbors after 'lying in wait' at their home . The American Red Cross in Yolo County honored Marsh at its annual Heroes Luncheon in 2009, the Sacramento Bee reported. But now the boy is being held without bail at the Yolo County Juvenile Detention Facility after his arrest on Monday. He will be arraigned on Wednesday. Marsh, who was 15 at the time of the killings, lived just two doors away from the elderly couple. Relatives . grew worried on April 14 after Northup, a popular local musician, . failed to show for a performance with his folk band. Police discovered . the bodies that evening during a welfare check. Heroic: Marsh, pictured aged 12 in 2009, was honored for saving his father's life as he had a heart attack . Former life: An article at the time noted that Marsh was a good student whose favorite subject was math . Police have not revealed a motive, but have said that there were signs the home was broken into. In their charging document, prosecutors said the killings were 'willful, . deliberate and premeditated' and that Marsh was 'lying in wait'. They . claim that the teenager 'inflicted torture' on the couple. Davis . police searched several locations on Monday, including Marsh's father's . home - the house on the same street as the couple's - and Marsh's . mother's home less than a mile away. Relatives . of the victims told the Bee that moving vans were seen outside Marsh's . father's home a couple of weeks after the murders. As well as playing with the local band, Northup practiced law for 63 years, including in criminal cases. Mary Northup, Oliver Northup's daughter, said she was relieved that the arrest had been made. Victims: Oliver 'Chip' Northup, 87, and Claudia Maupin, 74, were found stabbed in their home in April . Scene: The couple were found dead in their condo on April 14 after they Northup failed to attend a performance with his band. Marsh's father lived just a few houses away at the time . 'He was murdered – and not only murdered, but brutally murdered,' she told the Bee. 'Now I feel we can mourn that they're dead.' On Marsh, she added: 'I thought, ""It's a 16-year-old. It's a kid. Why would a kid want to kill an 87-year-old father?"" My father would be the first to jump up to defend that kid. 'I'm sorry we've suffered for his poor judgment. But I'm also sorry for this young man who has ruined his life.' The criminal complaint notes Marsh was only 15 at the time of the murders, which means he is not eligible for life without the possibility of parole or the death penalty. Instead he faces as many as 25 years to life in prison for each of the murders, if he is convicted.","Daniel Marsh, 16, 'stabbed his elderly neighbors to death in April'

Boast: Aides to Culture Secretary Maria Miller highlighted her children ahead of an internet porn summit . Maria Miller has been criticised for claiming she understands the need for internet porn controls because she is the ‘only mother at the Cabinet table’. The Culture Secretary’s aide made the comment ahead of yesterday’s Whitehall summit on the issue. Mrs Miller, who is married with three children, said at the weekend: ‘As a mother, I am determined to protect my children from the depravity of internet porn.’ The Cabinet’s other women – Home Secretary Theresa May, Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers and International Development Secretary Justine Greening – have no children. Labour’s media spokesman Helen Goodman said it was a ‘foolish’ choice of words. She added: ‘The job of Secretary of State is to stand up to the industry, not to start talking about her personality and family situation.’ Mrs Miller today hosted a summit in Parliament with senior figures from internet, communications and computing firms including Google, Microsoft and BT. The meeting agreed a new approach to tackling online child abuse images with a beefed-up role for the internet watchdog. Mrs Miller said they had agreed a ‘fundamental change’ to the way the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) works, with the industry-funded body set to adopt a role actively seeking out and blocking child pornography. The main UK internet service providers (ISPs) have agreed to provide extra funding for the IWF, understood to amount to £1 million, to help it take on the extra duties. Under current arrangements the IWF only acts on content that has been reported to it rather than proactively seeking out illegal images. Representatives from Yahoo!, Google, Microsoft, Twitter, Facebook, BT, Sky, Virgin Media, TalkTalk, Vodafone, O2, EE and Three were summoned to the meeting. The Culture Secretary said illegal child abuse images had caused concerns ‘particularly in recent months’. Checks: The Internet Watch Foundation is to have a beefed up role in actively seeking out and blocking child pornography (file picture) The parents of murdered children April Jones and Tia Sharp have called for more action to tackle child porn on the internet as the Government and technology giants agreed a new crackdown. In interviews with Channel 5 News, five-year-old April's parents Paul and Coral Jones and 12-year-old Tia's father Steven Carter both agreed their children's killers were spurred on by sick images found online. Mark Bridger, who killed April in Mid-Wales, and Stuart Hazell, murderer of Tia in south London, were both found to have accessed child and violent pornography and some experts argue there is a clear link between their obsessions and their actions. Mr and Mrs Jones told Channel 5 News that they want Prime Minister David Cameron to get personally involved in the fight against child abuse online. Mrs Jones said: 'April was a fighter from the word go and I promised her I'll do this for her.""I said I'll help other children, so their family don't have to go through this, their brothers and sisters. 'It's not just us it affects, it affects brothers and sisters as well. 'I just want it stopped and I think the Government should put more pressure and get it done now.' Mr Clark has told Channel 5 News that stopping indecent images of children from being published online could have saved his daughter Tia, who was brutally murdered by Stuart Hazell. He said: 'You're fuelling the beast and it needs to be stopped, it should have been stopped a long time ago when these people were setting up companies they should be looking at, right, what would be the outcome of indecent images of children?' Mark Bridger, who killed April Jones, . and Stuart Hazell, murderer of Tia Sharp, were both found to have . accessed child and violent pornography and some experts argue there is a . clear link between their obsessions and their actions. Mrs . Miller added: ‘I think any parent or anybody who is a resident in this . country wants to see illegal child abuse images dealt with, and dealt . with swiftly.’ But aides to the minister last night actively highlighted the fact that she is the ‘only mother in the Cabinet’. Helen . Goodman, Labour’s shadow media minister, said: ‘I think that was . foolish. It would be much better to come to Parliament and say this is . what we are thinking than briefing that you are the only mother in the . Cabinet. I don’t think we care about that.' Ms Goodman claimed the package agree was a 'damp squib'. She added: 'The job of Secretary of State is to stand up to the industry not to start talking about her personality and family situation. ‘We are not interested in how much people care. We are interested in how effective they are. There is not caring and wringing your hands if you don’t make some change.’ She added that it was ‘really shocking’ that Mr Cameron only had one mother in Cabinet. The remark risks being seen as insensitive towards her Cabinet colleagues. Home Secretary Theresa May, the most . senior woman in British politics, last year revealed her sense of loss . at not being a mother. She said: ‘It just didn’t happen. I mean, this isn’t something I generally go into, but things just turned out as they did. ‘You look at families all the time and you see there is something there that you don’t have,’ she told the Daily Telegraph. Other Cabinet ministers without children include Justine Greening, Eric Pickles and William Hague. In 2010 Mr Hague revealed how his wife Ffion has suffered ‘multiple miscarriages’. He said: ‘I have made no secret of the fact that Ffion and I would love to start a family. ‘For many years this has been our goal. Sadly this has proved more difficult for us than for most couples.’ It was also noted that Faith minister Baroness Warsi, who attends Cabinet but is not a full member, has a daughter. A Tory colleague said: ‘Maria has been briefed against and is probably defending herself from the recent continuous background attacks. ‘However her language was a little bit sloppy, protecting vulnerable people and enhancing online safety measures is a matter for all policy makers, whether they are a mother, father, grandparent, aunt uncles or simply a constituency MP.’","Aides to the Culture Secretary highlighted her children ahead of summit .

Ordeal: She was subjected to several Bush Tucker trials, including being buried in a coffin with bugs . Tory high command suspended Ms Dorries . as punishment for jetting off to be a contestant in I’m A Celebrity… . Get Me Out Of Here last November without permission. She was only allowed to return to the Conservative benches in May, after crunch talks with Chief Whip Sir George Young. The .

Contrast: Ms Dorries said only an 'idiot' would think David Cameron could win the 2015 election as she backed Boris Johnson as a future Tory leader who could win votes . She would not be the first politician to put on sequins and a smile in the name of entertainment. Business Secretary Vince Cable took part in a Christmas special of the show in December 2010 when he partnered with ballroom professional Erin Boag. But rules on impartiality meant he could not take part in the full Strictly series. Former Tory MP Anne Widdecombe lasted until week eight in the 2010 series, despite being heavily criticised by the judges. Judge Bruno Tonioli described her as like ‘a Dalek in drag’. Former Tory minister Ann Widdecombe took part in . Strictly in 2010 with partner Anton Du Beke while Business Secretary .

She said:  ‘I’m not allowed to talk about it, but I loved writing it.’ Asked if it was fiction or non-fiction, . she replied: ‘It’s ‘faction’ – it’s about Liverpool in the ‘50s. I can’t . say anything about it, but it was a very cathartic experience.’ Nadine Dorries revealed she will be ‘bald soon’. The Tory MP went public last month with her trauma at discovering a bald patch. She told Total Politics: ‘I realise I’m going to be bald soon. ‘Whereas in your twenties you can rock . that look, you can’t do it when you’re in your fifties like I am, and . you can’t do it in my job. ‘I know Mo Mowlam rocked that look when she had chemo, but it is a very difficult thing to do.’ The rebel MP stepped up her attack on the Prime Minister, and suggested only the Mayor of London could win a Tory majority. She said: ‘I understand it’s important to put out the message that we’re going to have a Conservative majority with Cameron… [but] the people who say that are foolhardy and setting themselves up to look like idiots. ‘There’s an element of political naivety and delusion; it shows disconnect from the general public.’ She said there is ‘no doubt’ that Mr Johnson will be leader of the Tory Party. ‘He’s won two major elections, and nobody else in the party matches that at the moment. We would be idiots not to have Boris. He’d take the party back to the highlands again pretty easily.’ She went on to claim that the coalition is ‘grinding down now’ and is at its ‘final ebb’. While there was no chance of her getting a call in the next reshuffle, Ms Dorries took the trouble to rule herself out of reaching ministerial office. She said: ‘I’d hate it, absolutely hate it. Imagine being the minister for paperclips and only being able to speak about paperclips, I’d hate it. I couldn’t actually think of anything worse.’ She also renewed her call for Tories and UK Independence Party joint candidates at the next election. ‘I’d have exactly the same values as the UKIP candidates standing against me it would make sense to talk about at least a joint candidacy.’","Rebel backbencher was suspended for jetting off to I'm A Celeb jungle .

An anti-drugs politician admitted yesterday he used to smoke marijuana. Ohio Republican Senator Rob Portman said he used cannabis when he was younger but now tries to educate children on the dangers of drug use. In 1996, Portman founded the Coalition for a Drug-Free Greater Cincinnati after 16-year-old Jeff Gardner died from huffing gasoline and smoking marijuana. When asked whether he had ever taken the drug, Portman told Buzzfeed: 'Uhh... yes. I think I've been asked that now, in 20 years, three times. 'I'm very involved, as you may know, on drug prevention. I have been since my first year in Congress.' Previously, the Senator said he did not buy or sell the drug and rarely smoked it. He started actively campaigning against drug use when he returned to Ohio in 1996 after a stint as President George Bush Snr's deputy assistant and director of the White House Office of Legislative Affairs. Portman founded the coalition in 1996 and it has since promoted drug-free environments for young people through education. He previously said of the organisation: 'I decided we could not afford to wait for another tragedy to prompt us to take action. Bill Clinton, pictured left with George Bush Snr, said he smoked cannabis as a student but 'did not inhale' 'Our aim is to develop and implement a comprehensive, community-based strategy to reduce drug abuse in our region.' Portman joins two Presidents who have admitted to smoking marijuana. President Barack Obama admitted using the drug as a teenager in his 1995 autobiography, Dreams From My Father. He wrote about some of his smoking haunts, including 'a white classmate’s sparkling new van', 'in the dorm room of some brother' and 'on the beach with a couple of Hawaiian kids'. In his memoir, Dreams Of My Father, Barack Obama said he smoked cannabis when he was a teenager . 'Pot had helped, and booze; maybe a little blow when you could afford it,' he adds in the memoir. Bill Clinton famously admitted smoking marijuana but 'not inhaling' while a studying at university in England. While Governor of Arkansas, he said: 'When I was in England, I experimented with marijuana a time or two, and didn't like it. I didn't inhale and I didn't try it again.'","Ohio Republican Senator Rob Portman said he has tried cannabis .

Mizzy has now been checked in to an animal fit club to try and help her lose more than a third of her 72kg body weight to reach her ideal size. The five-year-old, from Littleover in Derby, is currently so overweight that her vet now in charge of her diet can fit her over-sized dog collar around her waist. Scroll down to watch the video . Obese: Five-year-old bullmastiff Mizzy weighs 11 stone and four pounds - more than the average British woman . Mizzy is now so big that her over-sized collar is big enough to fit around a PDSA'a veterinary nurse's waist . Mizzy is one of 21 overweight animals - including a two-stone Norwegian Forest cat and an 11lb rotund rabbit - taking part in PDSA's six-month diet and exercise programme. Owner Cheryl Pedley described Mizzy as . a 'giant cuddly teddy bear'. The 50-year-old said: 'We got Mizzy when . she was a year old and she has always been a big girl, but wasn't . overweight. 'Then in early 2011 she had pyometra - a potentially fatal womb infection - and had emergency surgery. This . and some other health problems severely restricted her mobility and she . just piled on the pounds in just six months. She isn't given any . naughty treats at all, just dental sticks.' Long road ahead: Mizzy needs to lose a third of her 72kg body weight to reach he ideal size for a bullmastiff . Cause: Mizzy, from Littleover, in Derby, gained weight after having surgery on a potentially fatal womb infection . Veterinary . nurse Sue Bartlett, who is monitoring Mizzy at Derby's PDSA PetAid . hospital, said: 'Mizzy is morbidly obese, which can have very serious . consequences on her health and life expectancy. 'Overweight pets are less mobile, less willing to play and more likely to develop a number of serious health conditions. 'The good news is it's never too late to make a positive change and improve a pet's lifestyle. We're confident that Mizzy will have a slim-line figure and new lease of life by the end of the competition.' Ms Pedley added: 'I knew she had gained weight but simply didn't realise how overweight she had become, I knew her breed was supposed to be big. Exercise regime: Mizzy is now on a strict diet and is being taken on lots of long walks to shift the weight . Quick nap: Owner Cheryl Pedley said Mizzy piled on the weight in just six months after her operation . 'She used to love long walks so I didn't . think anything of giving her big helpings then, but I should have . adjusted her food when her activity levels decreased - hindsight is a . wonderful thing. 'When the vet explained the problems her extra weight was causing her I wanted to do everything I can to help her.

Threesome: Graham Allen Robertson admitted downloading indecent images of his ex-girlfriend onto CDs and putting them in envelopes addressed to her family and colleagues but denied mailing them . A 62-year-old male witch has avoided jail after photos of him having a threesome with his 30-year-old girlfriend and an unnamed man were mailed to her mother and work colleagues. Graham Allen Robertson was devastated at the end of his brief relationship with the woman after she began an affair with a separate man. In what was described as a cathartic ritual, he downloaded 51 of the indecent images onto 13 separate DVDs and labelled them with her name and the words 'The Shetland Dogger'. The discs were then sent to addresses in her home town of Lerwick, including the Shetland Islands Town Hall where she worked, numerous pubs and hotels, a taxi firm, hairdressers and the local boating club. But despite Mr Robertson admitting he had carefully packaged the discs in envelopes, he said he had never intended to send them and they were posted by a friend who had found them in his home in Glastonbury, Somerset. Mr Robertson, who describes himself as 'a witch', had several sexual encounters with the 30-year-old when she visited Glastonbury for a family holiday in October 2011, Somerset Magistrates heard. Prosecutor Simon Cooper said: 'They arranged to meet again and it was agreed Robertson would bring along a male friend to take part in consensual sexual activity with the woman and himself. 'While that was taking place, photographs of a sexually explicit nature were taken and she was aware of this.' Following the holiday she returned home and continued to contact Mr Robertson by phone and text messages. After another visit to Somerset six weeks later, he sent her a number of Christmas presents to her home, along with gifts for members of her family. Robertson then discovered she had started a relationship with another man from the Glastonbury area and as a result their relationship came to an end. He asked her to return the gifts he had sent her which she did apart from one, and it was after then that he downloaded 51 of the photographs onto discs. One by one the discs started to be received by businesses and individuals on the Shetland Islands, including the victim's own mother. Mr Cooper said: 'Several of the individuals contacted the police and when police searched Robertson's home address he handed over four similar discs with the same labelling. Significant: Mr Robertson describes himself as 'a witch' and said he chose to prepare 13 discs as the number has a special significance for him - but he maintains they were posted by a friend who found them in his hall . 'When he was interviewed he said he had become obsessed with the woman and the breakdown in their relationship had affected him very badly.' However, Mr Robertson told the court that despite previously saying that he had sent the discs, he had lied during his police interview to protect his new partner. He said he had suspected she sent them as he claimed she hated the victim after seeing the emotional breakdown he had suffered following their split. It was not until the autumn of 2012 that another woman, Julie Raybould, confessed that she had bought stamps and posted them on his behalf after finding them in the hallway of his home, saying she assumed he had intended to send them. Mr Robertson said he had prepared 13 discs and the number 13 was of great significance to him. 'I am a witch and I do things completely differently,' he said. 'They were not for sending but it was a symbolic thing I was doing. Not guilty: Mr Robertson was cleared by the court of sending offensive communications because the prosecution could not prove he posted the discs . 'I had a complete breakdown after the relationship ended and lost three stone in weight and was feeling very stressed. 'Downloading the photos onto discs was my way of dealing with this and I did a lot of research on the internet and found names and addresses of individuals and businesses and put the discs into envelopes but then put them away. 'I put all my frustrations and anger into it and that was my way of dealing with it, but they were never ever meant to be sent.' Mr Robertson's friend Ms Raybould, also from Glastonbury, said that she had found a large number of envelopes in Robertson's hallway and had taken them to a post office where she weighed them, bought stamps and then posted them to the various addresses not realising what they contained. In a written statement the victim explained that Mr Robertson had discovered her affair with the other man after she was tricked into accepting a friend request he had sent to her on Facebook while posing as a female. The police in Lerwick then contacted her saying that various people and businesses had started receiving the discs containing the explicit images. She said: 'He was bitter about me breaking contact with him and when I learned about the images he had sent I was shocked and felt physically sick.' Mr Robertson, of Manor Close, Glastonbury, denied 11 counts of sending a communication of an indecent or offensive nature between March 1, 2012 and March 31, 2012 when he appeared before Somerset Magistrates sitting at Yeovil on Tuesday. He was found not guilty after chairman of the Bench Christopher Thomas-Peter said it had not been proved beyond all reasonable doubt that Mr Robertson was the person who had sent the discs.","Graham Allen Robertson prepared CDs of illicit images after break-up .

John Galliano's fashion workshop at Parsons has been cancelled because the shamed designer refused to participate in 'a frank discussion of his career' with students. The shamed designer - who was forced out of his role as creative director for Christian Dior after footage of him making racist and anti-Semitic comments emerged online - was set to lead a three-day course titled 'Show Me Emotion' at the New York institute. However an email sent to students states that Paris-based Mr Galliano, 52, refused to compromise with the requests made by the teaching facility . Back to the day job: John Galliano's workshop at Parsons The New School for Design has been cancelled . In the email, obtained by website Fashionista, Parsons writes: 'It was a condition of our agreeing to host Mr. Galliano that we also hold a larger forum, which would include a frank discussion of his career. 'Ultimately, an agreement could not be reached with Mr. Galliano regarding the details of that forum, and so the program will not move forward.' The masterclass was set to include . a three-day workshop and a final assessment carried out by Mr Galliano . and Simon Collins, Dean of Parsons. Its cancellation comes shortly after an . anonymous petition, now holding over 2,000 signatures, was launched in a bid . to ban Mr Galliano from teaching. Keeping his head down: Mr Galliano, who was the head designer at Christian Dior for 15 years, has kept a low profile since his arrest, attending rehab for alcoholism and doing a temporary residency at Oscar de la Renta . It reads: 'It doesn't matter if it's for . three months or three days, hiring someone who has made such horrific . comments shows that the school values Galliano over their entire Jewish . student body. 'It shows they value him over their . students' respect, peace of mind, and heritage. It is disgraceful to . hire someone who has made such inhumane comments.' It also triggered a torrent of commentary. One person wrote on the website: 'By . letting him back into the broad public influence, it sends the wrong . message that his anti-Semitic remarks can be swept under the rug.' Another stated: 'A teacher's ethics are . inherent in what they teach, and I do not feel that Galliano is the kind . of person that should be teaching young minds.' Questionable ethics: The petition made reference to Mr Galliano's disrespect towards the entire Jewish student body at Parsons, located in New York's Greenwich Village . The John Galliano-taught class was previously . described as 'a dynamic and intimate opportunity for students to learn . from an immensely talented designer . . .  [and] about the challenges and complications of leading a . design house in the 21st century.' The letter goes on to acknowledge the designer's sordid past. 'We . believe that over the past two years Galliano has demonstrated a . serious intent to make amends for his past actions,' it stated. Mr Galliano was arrested in February 2011 after a video showed him uttering anti-Semitic remarks to group of people at a Paris cafe whom he assumed were Jewish. 'I love Hitler,' the designer slurs drunkenly in the clip. 'People like you would be dead. Your mothers, your forefathers, would all be f****** gassed,' he continued. Since the scandal, Mr Galliano has attended rehab for alcoholism and carried out a temporary residency at Oscar de la Renta, where he received rave reviews for his contribution to the designer's fall 2013 show.","Galliano, who was fired from his role as chief designer at Christian Dior after an anti-Semitic tirade in February 2011, was set to teach a three-day master class at the prestigious design school .

This bunny dressed as a sailor may look like an advert for a cartoon but it was in fact part of a serious medical campaign - against sexual transmitted diseases. Many of these vintage posters come across as crude, sexist and even threatening. However, in an age without TV and internet they were the first line of defence against diseases like tuberculosis and gonorrhoea. This poster featuring a rabbit dressed as a sailor was issued in 1946 by the American government to warn navy personnel against unprotected sex. The 'Pro' sign is thought to refer to prophylactics . A grotesque line- up of dictators Benito Mussolini, Hideki Tojo and Adolf Hitler carrying hypodermic needles was used to alarm soldiers over the possibility of catching venereal disease during the Second World War . The threat of the 'Axis' powers of Japan, Italy and Germany during the Second World War was equated with venereal disease in 1940 as the American Government believed it would make their soldiers too weak to fight . Aimed at soldiers returning from the First World War, keeping venereal disease under control was the next big challenge facing the government . The Canadian government warned its soldiers that 'innocent looks' may be 'booby traps' The collection, which come from across the world, often used sultry women to flag the dangers of venereal diseases and the Angel of Death to symbolise serious ailments. The devastating effects of polio on children, for example, was represented by Death holding a little girl's legs. The majority of the campaigns come from the early 1900s when infectious diseases like cholera, influenza and tuberculosis were the great scourges of society. Governments during the Second World War feared their soldiers would succumb to sexually transmitted diseases as they played away from home . Health posters often featuring sultry women in provocative poses, such as this one published in 1943 by the US government . There were also two world wars which caused massive upheaval and resulted in unsanitary conditions where disease flourished. Soldiers on the frontline were often the focus of these campaigns. One First World War poster depicts trench foot as being as much a danger as the enemy troops in the opposing trenches. The American Government was frightened that all the socialising between locals and soldiers would create an epidemic . The Canadian government also frightened its citizens with the list of symptoms of venereal disease, including sterility and blindness . The French Ministry of Hygiene was fearful in 1930 of syphilis, telling the public: Defend yourself against syphilis . Cholera is a deadly bacteria, causing death from dehydration, so this Soviet poster from 1967 urged citizens to get themselves vaccinated before the grim reaper struck . A frightening campaign from 1943, showed death holding a girl's legs was intended to raise awareness of Polio, or infantile paralysis. Polio epidemics in the early 20th century left thousands paralysed until vaccines were developed in the 1950s and 1960s . Venereal disease was also a major concern and during the First World War an estimated 18,000 US soldiers were treated for sex diseases every day. Only the great influenza pandemic of 1918-19 accounted for more soldiers taken out of the front line. So in the early days of the Second World War, the US War Department embarked on a massive propaganda campaign. This trench foot warning for American soldiers in the Second World War was a reaction to the drastic problems from the First World War in which affected feet would have to be amputated if untreated . A stern warning to 'obey the rules of health' between 1936 and 1941to avoid Tuberculosis, which could be avoided with a proper diet and adequate sleep and sunshine exposure . This poster appeared in the USA in 1918 appealing for help for Serbia. The country had been devastated by the First World War, leaving ideal conditions for a cholera epidemic. This health warning poster used between 1941 and 1945 issued by the US government's Office of War Information was particularly graphic . This poster was used from 1941 to 1944 as part of the American war effort. Although discovered in 1928 in the UK, penicillin was not mass-produced until 1944, when the USA produced 2.3 million doses in time for the Normandy invasion . It was principally aimed at preventing VD among its millions of male soldiers. This resulted in a series of bizarre health posters often featuring sultry women in provocative poses accompanied by phrases such as 'She May Look Clean - But...' However, this 'golden age' of medical posters soon came to an end with the development of antibiotics and vaccines which made infectious diseases more controllable.","Governments desperate to stop the spread of contagious diseases used alarming posters to drive their message home .

Killer: Brady, sketched at the tribunal yesterday taking notes, is not allowed a pen while in the secure hospital in Merseyside, after he carried it as a weapon . He committed some of the most notorious crimes of the 20th century – but Moors Murderer Ian Brady is now reduced to targeting those he dislikes by smearing jam and honey on their furniture. The child killer regularly wipes the spreads on a chair used by a patient he bears a grudge against, and spills cereal near another's room, a mental health tribunal heard yesterday. According to a psychiatrist treating Brady at Ashworth secure hospital, his bizarre 'surreptitious revenge' is a response to being incapable of physical violence as a frail 75-year-old. Dr James Collins, who Brady has refused to speak to since beginning a hunger strike over a decade ago, cited the breakfast-themed campaign as evidence of his paranoid schizophrenia. Brady also believed he could talk to Laurel and Hardy, Cilla Black and Indira Gandhi, Dr Collins added. Brady, who won the right to have the tribunal held in public, is being force-fed, but wants to be sent back to prison in the belief he will be able to starve himself to death. The hearing is taking place behind closed doors at the Merseyside hospital, but proceedings are being relayed to a courtroom in Manchester. Dr Collins, Brady's medical officer for more than a decade, said the killer regularly smeared jam or honey on a chair in the ward's day room used by a patient referred to as R. He described the tactic as 'surreptitious revenge by other means', prompted by Brady's failing health. 'When he was younger, he would have it out with these guys,' he explained. 'He's now frail and elderly. 'The smearing of jam and honey on this guy's chair in the day area is clearly designed to wind him up.' Dr Collins said there was no justification for Brady's campaign against R, which could only be explained by delusions caused by mental illness. Brady's food-related campaign also extends to spilling cereal outside the door to a patient's room, the psychiatrist said. The mental health tribunal is taking place behind closed doors at Ashworth Hospital on Merseyside . Two faces of a killer: A sketch of Brady at the tribunal hearing yesterday, feeding tube in nose, and, right, in 1965 when he was last seen . 'It's abnormal by any standards,' he . said. 'No one else is going around scattering shredded oats or whatever . they are outside people's doors in Ashworth, however ill they are.' Patient R was also the target of an incident last year when Brady accused him of making 'pig noises'. Dr Collins gave more details of the . incident, describing how it culminated in Brady holding an uncapped pen . in the face of another occupant of the ward in the style of a weapon. Brady, a prolific letter-writer, was later banned from having a pen. Along with Myra Hindley, who died in . 2002, Brady killed five children between 1963 and 1965 and buried them . on Saddleworth Moor. He is expected to give evidence next week. Moors murderer Ian Brady was glimpsed yesterday in the tribunal room at the maximum security Ashworth Hospital in Merseyside . Link: Proceedings are being relayed by video to Press and relatives of Brady and fellow killer Myra Hindley's victims at a court 40 miles away in Manchester . Moors murder victim Lesley Ann Downey, who was just 10 when she was sadistically murdered . Yesterday at the tribunal it was revealed Brady plotted to break out of his maximum security hospital with a female visitor. Brady gave the woman cash, clothes . and a picture of himself as he seduced her in an effort to get out of . Ashworth secure hospital in Merseyside. His personal clinician told a panel of experts that it was 'clearly a preparation' for an escape, which ultimately failed. The hearing was told the killer, 75, has also claimed to be in communication with a reincarnated Nazi and believed he could change the laws of physics. The tribunal is being held as Brady seeks to be released from the hospital so he can die at a prison in Scotland. Describing . the delusions which led to his being detained at Ashworth in 1985, Dr . James Collins said Brady had also complained of being controlled by . ‘green beings’. At one stage, he said Brady had been exchanging letters with a woman he believed to be ‘a reincarnated Nazi’. He told a prison visitor that he could ‘change the laws of physics’ and ‘walk through locked doors at night’, he added. Dr . Collins is Brady’s responsible medical officer at Ashworth but said the . mass murderer had refused to engage with him for more than a decade. He . believes Brady continues to suffer from paranoid schizophrenia, . recounting how the delusions escalated in the 1980s when he began adding . excessive amounts of salt to his food. Brady would wait for fellow prisoners to finish their meals then take plates of custard, gravy or rice pudding to his cell. There he would add salt ‘piled like snow’ and eat until he vomited while cursing himself and beating the walls. Asked why, Brady replied: ‘I like salt.’ Dr Collins said this was a . ‘ridiculous answer’ and in reality showed that Brady thought his food . was being tampered with – a psychotic symptom, he added. Although no further details of the escape plot were revealed, Dr Collins used it as an example of the killers powers of manipulation. He . told the hearing: 'It was clearly a preparation for an escape. There is . no doubt at all about that. He opened up to this woman more than anyone . else.' Brady also walked out of his mental health tribunal yesterday, complaining he had 'listened to this ad nauseam'. But he was quickly slapped down by the judge who warned him 'we will hear the evidence.' Innocent: Keith Bennett (left) and John Kilbride (right) were murdered by Ian Brady and Myra Hindley. Keith's body is still missing. Brady has never revealed the whereabouts of the 12-year-old's body . Grim search: Police scour Saddleworth Moor for the bodies of the children killed by Ian Brady and Myra Hindley in this 1986 file picture . Ian Brady (right) arriving at court by taxi in 1966. He is Britain's longest-serving prisoner . The child killer even suggested a panel member had fallen asleep at one point during the hearing. The . 75-year-old complained that he had heard all the evidence before as a . criminal psychologist was questioned over several hours about his mental . health. At the end of Dr . Adrian Grounds's evidence, Judge Robert Atherton, chair of the three-man . tribunal panel, asked if Brady wanted to say something. Brady, wearing dark sunglasses, a . dark jacket, white shirt and tie, spoke in a low, gravelly Scottish . accent. Many of his words were inaudible. Referring to Dr Cameron Boyd, who sits on the tribunal panel, Brady said: 'It even apparently lulls him to sleep.' In other evidence yesterday, the . tribunal was told that Brady is nocturnal and only leaves his room at . night. He shuns others, partly because of his superiority complex. Evil: Myra Hindley died in hospital aged 60 after suffering respiratory failure in 2002 . But he also fears other patients and . habitually carried a pen between his knuckles as an improvised weapon, . until it was taken away. As well as his 'nocturnal' existence, . Brady was described as contemptuous of his peers. He shows anger that . can erupt over minor matters and unleashes verbal tirades against staff . and other patients, the tribunal heard. He also targets individuals, both . staff and patients, attempts to manipulate others, bypasses security and . bends the rules to suit himself, the panel was told. He will only deal with people 'high . up' in the hospital hierarchy - consistent with his narcissistic . personality disorder, the tribunal heard. Brady, who has been on hunger strike since 1999, claims he has faked psychotic episodes by 'acting' in the past. The hearing was told of hospital records from January 29 this year stating how Brady has now 'almost totally isolated himself'. Following a seizure last July, . hospital notes recorded him saying: 'If I have to, I will never let them . see me in pain. I will act as if I have not a care in the world.' Brady is currently 'nursed' in the hospital setting because he is regarded as being severely mentally ill. Brady and partner Myra Hindley murdered five youngsters in the 1960s, burying their bodies on Saddleworth Moor above Manchester. Both were jailed for life at Chester Assizes in 1966. Hindley died in jail in November 2002 at the age of 60. The hearing is being held in a room inside Ashworth and relayed by video to Manchester Civil Justice Centre.","Brady suffers from constant paranoia, his mental health tribunal has heard .

'Day of reckoning': Gordon Brown has warned that Italy and France may need bailouts as the Euro debt crisis spreads . France and Italy may need massive bailouts, as the euro approaches its 'day of reckoning', Gordon Brown warned last night. The former Prime Minister, who played a key role in co-ordinating global action in response to the Credit Crunch, accused European leaders of failing to rise to the challenge of the crisis - and warned that Europe could be facing a 'lost decade'. In a hard-hitting article for the Reuters news agency, Mr Brown said the European economy was in a 'downward spiral that shows no sign of ending'. He said Greece was likely to suffer a 'chaotic' exit from the euro regardless of the result of Sunday's elections, with a string of other countries likely to suffer serious financial contagion as a result. He warned that Europe's banks may need a further £400 billion in emergency funding. Writing on the eve of the G20 Summit in Mexico, Mr Brown urged world leaders to bring forward radical proposals to stave off the threat of collapse. 'The standard, but often empty, language of summit communiqués will simply not do when the euro area is finally approaching its own day of reckoning,' he said. 'Whichever way the Greeks vote in Sunday's election, a chaotic exit from the euro is becoming more likely - its tax revenues are collapsing, not rising as promised. 'Unable to regain access to markets, Portugal and Ireland will soon have to ask for their second IMF programmes (bailouts). 'Sadly Italy - and potentially even France - may soon follow Spain in needing finance as the European recession deepens. Even German banks, which are some of the most highly leveraged, are not immune from needing more capital.' Today, the International Monetary Fund . sounded a warning note over Spain, telling the country's leaders they . should raise taxes and slash government workers pay to narrow the budget . deficit. The international . lending group said the Spanish deficit is likely to exceed estimates and . the government should therefore consider several measures to boost tax . revenue. Meltdown: Greece - which has been subject to civil unrest - will quit the euro, Mr Brown predicts . An IMF report suggested that Spain raise VAT and eliminate a a deduction on mortgage payments for first-time homebuyers, which was recently reintroduced. Spain's Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has resisted increases in the VAT. The previous government boosted it to 18 per cent in 2010, though it remains one of the lowest in Europe. Spain set a goal of reducing its deficit to 5.3 per cent of gross domestic product, or GDP, in 2012. The IMF report called that goal 'very ambitious' and said it would 'likely be missed.' It also criticised Spain in unusually blunt terms for missing its target in 2011. European leaders agreed last weekend to provide Spain's government with a loan of up to $125billion to bail out its ailing banks. The prospect of either France or Italy needing bailouts would raise questions about whether the euro could survive. European dream in tatters? Ripped EU and Greek flags flutter in Athens. Mr Brown said only greater fiscal union, with a single European lender of last resort could save the euro . Mr Brown accused European leaders of having a 'one-dimensional obsession' with cutting budget deficits and national debt. He said this had led them to ignore the continuing 'seismic tremors' in the banking industry, as well as stalling a return to economic growth. Independent analysis of Spain's debts suggested they were so huge that they 'cannot be repaid on any normal timetable'. Mr Brown said only greater fiscal union, with a single European lender of last resort could save the euro. In a blunt warning to world leaders, he said: 'If there is a failure of global leadership next week, not only will Europe be condemned to a lost decade but the whole world will pay a fearful price. 'The lesson I learned in 2009 is that when a problem escalates into a global problem, you need a global solution.'","Former prime minister warns of Europe's 'lost decade' in rare article .

Pensioners are being left in hospital beds for weeks on end because of a critical shortage of home helps and nursing home places . Thousands of older people are being left in hospital beds for weeks on end because of a critical shortage of home helps and nursing home places. An international report found 'bed blocking' patients are stuck on wards unnecessarily for an average of 30 days – the highest level since the last election – putting their recovery at risk. Campaigners said the 'bleak' study raises a fresh NHS scandal, on the heels of a meltdown in accident and emergency and out of hours care. The problem in England's elderly care . is highlighted in a report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation . and Development, which represents industrialised countries. It . found that in January – the latest month for which figures were . available – some 4,200 patients were kept unnecessarily in hospitals for . a total of 126,000 days. That . works out at an average of 30 days per patient spent waiting to leave . even though there was no clinical reason for them to be there. Just . after the Coalition came to power, in August 2010, the average was 22 . days, according to the OECD. Hospitals are forced to keep such patients . because they are too frail to be sent home on their own. Campaigners say elderly people deteriorate if they are left in hospital, and also risk superbug infections. They . say councils should provide home helps or free adaptations such as . handrails to enable elderly people to leave hospital. Alternatively, . they should be put in a care home for a limited period until they are . ready to go to their own house. Many town halls say they cannot afford . to provide these services after recent cuts – forcing the NHS to step . in. The Daily Mail's Dignity For The . Elderly campaign has repeatedly highlighted the plight of older people . as local authorities increasingly restrict social care to those with . 'critical' or 'substantial' needs, and home care has been slashed – with . 20,000 fewer people receiving support. Delayed discharges have cost the cash-strapped health service around £260million since the election. Michelle . Mitchell, from charity Age UK, said: 'This is not just a real waste of . resources. Unnecessary and lengthy hospital stays can seriously . undermine an older person's recovery. Campaigners say elderly people deteriorate if they are left in hospital, and also risk superbug infections . 'These figures are an insight into the increasingly bleak reality of the social care crisis where funding has failed to keep pace with demand. 'The steep rise in the length of time people are waiting ... suggests something has gone seriously wrong in the transition to home or residential care at a time when we know social care spending has fallen so dramatically. 'The care system urgently needs an injection of funds and a long-term commitment to sufficient resources.' The OECD report, entitled A Good Life In Old Age, said delayed  discharges result from 'inadequate capacity in nursing homes or home-care services and support'. It said: 'Waiting times are regarded as an indicator of poor access and a major challenge for delivering high-quality care services. 'Waiting may occur when older  people needing long-term care are discharged from acute care to a  more appropriate care setting such as community care and residential care for which there is a waiting list. 'This may lead to patients occupying acute care beds when no longer in need of acute care services.'","Report found 'bed blocking' patients stuck for an average of 30 days .

Gary's heyday was in the post-war boom of the 1950s when almost 200,000 people lived and worked in the bustling city, 25 miles from Chicago . The city now owns 7,000 properties in Gary - many of them have been taken for non-payment of taxes. Redevelopment Director Joe Van Dyk has worked out that 6,500 them are abandoned. In the next few months the city is planning to auction off the housing for $1 each. The homes would each need $15,000-$30,000 in repairs. Buyers would have to agree to renovate their purchases as quickly as possible. If buildings are beyond repair, NBC reports that a 'deconstruction' program could be initiated - to take apart  buildings and recycle materials. Gary's heyday was in the post-war boom of the 1950s when almost 200,000 people lived and worked in the bustling city, 25 miles from Chicago. As the American manufacturing sector contracted, Gary's population fell by over 50 percent and no one now uses the once bustling train stations, churches and auditoriums that are now decaying as they are left to the elements.

Cuts: This modern American ghost town began life as home for workers at the United States Steel Corporation plant until economic competition from abroad forced a 90 percent job cut . Frequently rated one of the ten most dangerous cities in the United States, Gary once boomed with jobs and opportunities but now faces the acute difficulties of America's growing rust belt, with 22 percent of families in the once-great city now lying below the poverty line. This modern American ghost town began life as home for workers at the United States Steel Corporation plant until economic competition from abroad forced a 90 percent job cut. Thirty-thousand jobs were gone in a flash and the flight of people away from Gary led to whole swathes of buildings being abandoned such as the once proud City Methodist Church which was built in the 1920s. U.S. Steel paid $385,000 towards the $1 million construction costs of the church, which used to hold 950 people every Sunday and boasted a total congregation of 3,000.

Ghost town: Thirty-thousand jobs were gone in a flash and the flight of people away from Gary led to whole swathes of buildings being abandoned . The church also had a large school, gymnasium and an auditorium named the Seaman Hall where the city would hold community meetings, plays and musical events. By 1970 the number of attendees for Sunday mass had fallen to 100 and in 1975 the church closed for good and began its long decent into despair. Lying dormant and unused since then, many plans have been mooted to restore the place of worship including turning the vast empty spaces into a centre for performing arts or even to gracefully culture the ruins into an open garden. However, with no funds and no concrete interest, the City of Gary has allowed the crumbling building to become a symbol of the decline of northwest Indiana and American industry. Other building's such as the city's Union Station are potent reminders of the heights that Gary has fallen from. Constructed to feed the growing city in 1910, the station lasted only another five decades before being closed and left to nature to take its course. In fact, in 2008, the station was used as an example of what would happen to a Chicago building if no people were around to tend to its upkeep in the series 'Life After People'. The 10,000 Gilroy Stadium on the western edge of Gleason Park in Gary, Indiana has laid in ruins since 1976, only 20 years after it opened. With no one around the watch the football games in the city, the stadium was shut, but not before it had hosted Gary's most famous son's, the Jackson Five for a 1969 concert. Ever since the 1990's successive mayor's of Gary have pledged to revitalize the city, but to date nothing has been realised.","Gary was once the centre of the country's booming steel industry .

One of Britain’s most dangerous sex offenders, who once impersonated a priest to trick his way into a woman’s home and rape her, has returned to live in Scotland. Police yesterday confirmed that John Cronin, 41, is living at an address believed to be his elderly parents’ home in Tranent, East Lothian, after being released from prison. Psychiatrists have called him ‘incurable’, while a police source has warned he is likely to strike again. But the rapist, who was not placed on the Sex Offenders’ Register because it did not exist when he committed his crime, is free from all restrictions and can go wherever he wants. Police Scotland would not confirm if he was under surveillance, although officers are believed to be aware of his movements. Cronin has committed more than 50 offences over 25 years, including dishonesty, theft and fraud. He was first jailed for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl. In 1992 he posed as a priest to get into the Edinburgh home of a female Conservative Party activist, known as Judy X. He subjected her to a brutal sexual assault, and beat her savagely. But his life sentence was cut to six years on appeal and he served only four years for the horrific crime. His devastated victim called the sentence ‘an insult’, saying courts had ‘lost sight of the rights of the victim’. Now locals in Tranent, on hearing Cronin has returned to Scotland for the first time in 17 years, are fearing for their safety. One grandmother, who did not wish to be named but lives close by, said: ‘I have a padlock on my back gate to keep me safe. I have heard he is back in the area – he has been seen in the street – and I really wish he was not.’ Another neighbour dubbed Cronin a ‘beast’, and locals have been throwing stones at the house where he is staying. Cronin . is known for pretending to be a priest and for targeting women in . politics. Shortly after his release for rape, he was caught dressed as a . priest and trying to get into the Irish parliament. He was jailed again in 1997 for making harassing telephone calls and threats to female politicians. On his release, between 1998 and 2001, he is believed to have been involved in a number of thefts and frauds. He has posed as the mayor of Birmingham, and in 2002 was sentenced to two years for an armed bank raid in Waterford, Ireland. 'Beast': Cronin has committed more than 50 offences, including a violent rape, over 25 years . In recent years he has been spotted . dressed as a priest in Sligo, Galway and Donegal and has tried to con . women by pretending to be a soldier. His latest jail term came after he stole £50 from nuns who took him in at a retreat in County Antrim. He . is now free to roam the country at will, despite psychiatrists . labelling him ‘one of the most dangerous sexual predators in Britain’. A . police source said: ‘We will be keeping an eye on him but there are no . restrictions in place for him so he can do what he likes legally. Experience tells us he will reoffend – and soon.’ A man at the address where Cronin is believed to be staying refused to comment.

Adrift: Teenagers are not being given the career advice they need, according to a prominent business leader . Children as young as 12 need careers advice to stop them wasting their working lives and their talents, a business leader warned yesterday. John Cridland, director general  of the CBI, said he was alarmed by the ‘big mismatch between the skills  that young people have and the realities of the workplace’. Mr Cridland, whose organisation represents 240,000 businesses, accused the Government of adopting ‘too laissez-faire an approach’ by relying heavily on teachers, leaving formal careers advice ‘on life support’ and assuming family and friends would ‘pick up the pieces’. Mr Cridland accused the Government of adopting ‘too laissez-faire an approach’ by over-relying on teachers, with the result that family and friends often have to ‘pick up the pieces’. The comments came a fortnight after the Coalition’s new social mobility tsar, James Caan, was embroiled in an embarrassing nepotism row. The former Dragon’s Den panellist suggested children should make their own way in life - only for it to emerge the private equity and recruitment tycoon had employed his two daughters and four other members of his family. Mr Cridland told the Grammar Schools Heads’ Association annual conference: ‘The jump from school or college to work is getting bigger year-by-year, decade-by-decade. 'The education system needs to develop the rigorous, rounded and grounded young people who can make that leap. ‘The competition for jobs has never been so tough, with young people hit by a double whammy of slow economic growth and a rapidly changing labour market. ‘Yet it’s alarming there is such a big mismatch between the skills that young people have and the realities of the workplace. We cannot afford to waste talent and investment when the long-term outlook is still so fragile. John Cridland, Deputy Director General of the CBI, says young people will have to contend with slow economic growth and a rapidly changing labour market . James Caan, the former Dragon's Den panellist, suggested children should make their own way in life, but it emerged that he employed his two daughters and other members of his family . ‘It’s clear that the careers advice system has not worked for employers or students for many years. A job for life has been and long gone - today’s jobs market is much more complex. ‘Young people need reliable, high-quality advice but the system is too dependent on individual teachers or it’s left to family and friends to pick up the pieces. That’s simply not good enough. ‘We know careers advice is on life support in many areas, as schools struggle with the new statutory duty. ‘It’s right that schools should have the freedom to run their own affairs but the Government may have adopted too laissez-faire an approach, with serious consequences for our young people.’ Mr Cridland, whose organisation represents 240,000 businesses, said ‘face-to-face’ guidance was needed for pupils aged 12 and over and called for the National Careers Service to be given access to schools. A report from the Commons Education Select Committee earlier this year warned there had been a 'worrying deterioration' in careers advice available to young people . At present only adults have personal contact with NCS advisers. Young people contact the service over the phone or internet. He also recommended the government’s new traineeship programme and 16-19 study programmes should have impartial careers guidance and firms should volunteer employees to mentor pupils and offer career support. The National Careers Council released a report earlier this month which called for more to be done to ensure young people were informed about a wide variety of jobs. Those in greatest need, it said, were youngsters from less deprived backgrounds who don’t have access to the social and family networks that more privileged people can use to find work. The Commons Education Select Committee has also raised concerns about the issue. A report earlier this year warned there had been a ‘worrying deterioration’ in careers advice available to young people. Brian Lightman, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the ‘bewildering array’ of career routes meant many made the wrong choice. ‘A national telephone helpline and a website are useful for information but they are no substitute for a conversation with a qualified, knowledgeable careers professional who can help them make informed choices,’ he added. John Richards, head of education at public sector union Unison, said providing careers advice had been ‘dumped on schools with no extra funding’. * The speech coincided with a poll of 500 workers that found 77 per cent admit having regrets about their career choice. Four per cent of workers felt they should have chosen a less pressurised job, according to a poll. File picture . Over a third yearned for a more exciting or worthwhile job, while 31 per cent wished they had chosen something more lucrative and seven per cent wanted a less demanding role. Four per cent felt they should have chosen a less pressurised job, according to the poll for office space provider officebroker.com. A Department for Education spokeswoman said the new system replaced one that was ‘patchy, costly and often of poor quality’. The National Careers Service website had received seven million visits in its first year and a webchat facility had been used more than 67,000 times by young people, she added. ‘It is clear that headteachers are best placed to judge the needs of their pupils and the type of careers advice they will most benefit from,’ the spokeswoman said. ‘We have issued guidance to schools to help them fulfil their obligation, and Ofsted has said it will prioritise the inspection of careers guidance from September.’ The current system replaced the Connexions Service, which was run by local authorities and provided universal careers guidance.","John Cridland says teens are woefully ill-equipped to deal with job market .

Tracked down: Robert Bill vanished after emigrating to Spain to exploit a loophole in the sex offenders register despite a police warning he was a 'high risk' offender . A British paedophile freed from prison in the UK last year has been arrested in Morocco after allegedly trying to rape a six-year-old girl. Robert Bill vanished after emigrating to Spain to exploit a loophole in the sex offenders register despite a police warning he was a 'high risk' offender. Spanish detectives were already hunting him for the attempted abduction of a 12-year-old girl in a Costa del Sol resort weeks after he started his new life in the sun. Last night he was back behind bars in the northern Moroccan port city of Tetouan after locals stopped him raping his latest target. He is said to have confessed to two other rapes in the north African country since fleeing there last November when Spanish police identified him as the beast who tried to bundle a schoolgirl into a car near Malaga. Bill, from St Asaph, Denbighshire, Wales, left Britain last August after finishing two prison sentences for crimes including attempted abduction and indecent assault and moving to the Costa del Sol. He informed police in the UK he was emigrating - but slipped off the radar after telling supervision officers he would find accommodation 'upon arrival.' Spanish police issued an international arrest warrant after the attempted abduction in Velez-Malaga last November. Former teacher and playground designer Bill is expected to be tried in Morocco before being extradited to Spain. His arrest is bound to raise questions about the way the sex offenders register works. Costa del Sol, Malaga: Bills rented a cottage in a remote mountain hamlet an hour's drive from Malaga after jetting to Spain - and later got an office job at an estate agent's . North Wales Police have confirmed they informed the Spanish authorities when he left Britain - but were powerless to force them to do regular checks on his whereabouts or make him register his new foreign address. He rented a two-bed cottage in a remote mountain hamlet an hour's drive from Malaga after jetting to Spain - and later got an office job at an estate agent's on the coast. Locals told how he drove a Peugeot 106 with a 'baby on board' sticker in the back window despite not having a young child. He disappeared after telling expats he befriended at a pub he had to return to Britain for emergency treatment for a throat problem. Days later Spanish police revealed they were hunting him after obtaining CCTV footage of him bundling a 12-year-old Romanian youngster into his car. The schoolgirl only escaped the sex pervert's clutches after escaping through an unlocked door before he sped off with her. He was arrested in Tetouan on Tuesday after being chased down by locals who heard his six-year-old victim screaming and handed him over to police. Local reports said he had been questioned - and already confessed - to a rape in the same city and another in the popular tourist town of Chefchaouen an hour's drive south. My father is a dangerous man and in north Wales everyone knows about his convictions. 'But over in Spain expats had no idea. It just shouldn't have happened.' Bill's son Stephen, 27, from Preston . Bill, a Jehovah's Witness, was convicted in March 2009 of trying to abduct a five-year-old girl as he cruised around a council estate in Holywell, Wrexham in June 2007. He was also found guilty of downloading child porn on his computer and indecently assaulting an eight-year-old girl. He appealed against his conviction - but changed his plea to guilty shortly before a retrial and admitted breaching a Sex Offences Prevention Order (SOPO) by viewing videos of children on YouTube while on bail. Recorder of Chester, Judge Elgan Edwards, jailed him for two years for the attempted abduction and six months for breaching the sex offences order. He said at the time: 'The public may have some consolation that when you are released you will be monitored by North Wales Police officers who will help you, and more importantly the children of North Wales will be protected.' A spokesman for North Wales Police said after he fled Spain: 'We were managing Robert Edward Bill after his release from prison until he informed us he was moving to Spain in August to look for work. 'We took steps to inform the Spanish authorities.' A source close to the case said: 'Bill flew to Malaga from Birmingham on August 9 2012 after filling in a form saying he was moving to Spain to look for work and would find accommodation 'on arrival.' 'He committed no offence under the terms of the sex offenders register and did what nine out of ten sex offenders do in the same circumstances. 'The law doesn't stipulate we are obliged to inform foreign agencies but on this occasion we did. 'Police in the UK make regular unannounced visits to sex offenders to make sure they are living where they say they are. 'We can't oblige foreign police forces to do the same, especially when sex offenders are under no obligation to register their addresses when they go abroad as they are in Britain. It does seem to us a loophole in the law.' Bill's son Stephen, 27, from Preston, said at the time: 'I think it is ridiculous that European law allows him the right to build a new life in Spain around people who know nothing about him or his past. 'My father is a dangerous man and in north Wales everyone knows about his convictions. 'But over in Spain expats had no idea. It just shouldn't have happened.'

The Office of Fair Trading yesterday revealed plans for the first investigation into Britain’s troubled small business banking sector for more than a decade. The probe by the Government watchdog is a sign of the long-running crisis facing small firms, many of whom desperately need cash but cannot get it. Others complain about the struggle to even open a current account, the rip-off charges and high interest rates on loans, and the demand to secure a loan on an entrepreneur’s family home. Crisis: Small firms complain about the struggle to even open a current account, the rip-off charges and high interest rates on loans, and the demand to secure a loan on an entrepreneur's family home (file picture) The investigation is a victory for this newspaper’s ‘Make the Banks Lend’ campaign, launched nearly three years ago, which has regularly highlighted the plight of small firms in Britain. The OFT said its investigation, known as a ‘market study’, will cover banking for small and medium-sized businesses in England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Clive Maxwell, chief executive of the OFT, said: ‘A competitive banking system and access to finance is vital to businesses and to economic growth’. The investigation will examine if: . The move comes after Business Secretary Vince Cable last week slammed the failure of Britain’s banks to lend money, saying many entrepreneurs are furious about their treatment.

That is . where I think there is a real anger.’ Anger: Business Secretary Vince Cable (pictured on June 5 in central London) last week slammed the failure of Britain's banks to lend money, saying many entrepreneurs are furious about their treatment . Asked if the Funding for Lending Scheme, . the Government’s latest attempt to solve the problem, will cure the . problem, he said: ‘Well, it isn’t at the moment.’ Mr Cable added: ‘It is overwhelmingly targeted at the mortgage market which is frankly where we don’t need more demand.’ Net lending - which is the total amount of money handed out by the banks minus the amount paid back by firms - has mostly been in negative territory since the financial crisis began.

'With the concentration of banking in the last 20 years, real competition and choice has all but vanished' John Allan, Federation of Small Businesses . Since last summer, their net lending has collapsed by a total of nearly £11billion - £6.6billion for Lloyds and £4billion for RBS. A recent report found more than half of small firms in some parts of Britain such as the West Midlands and the North West have been rejected by their bank for a loan over the last two years. Yesterday a report by the Bank said many firms ‘still struggled to obtain working capital or to finance growth.’ Others are ‘reluctant’ to agree to onerous terms and conditions on loan deals, it said. John Allan, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: ‘With the concentration of banking in the last 20 years, real competition and choice has all but vanished. ‘More competition is needed across the sector, not just in retail banks but from alternative providers, if access to finance is to improve for small firms and for innovation to flourish. ‘For too long, the main high-street banks have had a monopoly on lending to these customers.’ Yesterday a spokesman for the British Bankers’ Association said: ‘The banking industry is fully supportive of a competitive finance landscape for businesses which drives innovation and will co-operate fully with this market study.’","OFT probe is a sign of the long-running crisis facing small firms .

The executive who ran HSBC while it laundered money for drug barons and terrorists yesterday quit his new role as a trade minister. The departure of Lord Green came on the same day that the government pledged to bring in laws to jail bosses of failed lenders. Number 10 sources insisted the peer's role at the bank had nothing to do with his decision to stand down, saying he had always intended to go after two to three years. Lord Green, who ran HSBC while it laundered money for drug barons and terrorists, has quit his new role as a trade minister . However, his continued presence in a key role promoting UK businesses overseas would have been a serious embarrassment to the Coalition as it seeks to reform the banking sector. The peer's exit was revealed by David Cameron as he vowed to follow the recommendations of an investigation that found 'deep lapses in standards' in the UK banking system. He is the second former bank boss to resign within hours of the report from the Parliamentary Banking Commission, which recommended executives guilty of 'reckless mismanagement' should face jail, delayed bonuses or pension cancellations. Neville Richardson, former head of the Co-operative Bank, quit on Tuesday night as a director of Marks & Spencer bank and of estate agent Countrywide. The Co-op Bank was this week forced to announce plans to shed its mutual status in order to plug a £1.5billion black hole in its capital. Mr Cameron told the Commons that he would accept the recommendations of the Banking Commission, which called for new legislation and rules that will allow bonuses to be clawed back. Downing Street officials say that ministers will add amendments to the banking Bill going through Parliament. David Cameron has vowed to follow the recommendations of an investigation that found 'deep lapses in standards' in the UK banking system . 'Penalising, including with criminal penalties against bankers who behave irresponsibly – I say yes,' Mr Cameron told MPs. 'Also, making sure that for banks in receipt of taxpayers' money we can claw back and have a ban on bonuses – I say yes too.' But Labour leader Ed Miliband said the Government has done little to curb bonuses, citing figures released last week that show they rose 64 per cent in April compared with the same month a year ago. He said the surge was due to bankers deferring their bonuses until the top rate of tax was cut from 50p to 45p in the pound. 'People took their bonuses in April, and were given a massive tax cut as a result,' he said. Lord Green faced questions about his role after a US Senate investigation found that HSBC did not take sufficient action to prevent money laundering during his time as chief executive and chairman. The Conservative peer joined the bank in 1982 and rose to the top job in 2003 – a year after it bought a Mexican bank linked to alleged laundering of drug money. He was chairman from 2005 to 2010 before being given a government role by David Cameron. During his time at the top, the bank also did business with banks linked to terrorism. It was fined £1.2billion by US authorities, but Lord Green claimed in a letter last year that he had 'no case to answer'. He will now be replaced in his ministerial role by Ian Livingstone, the chief executive of BT. A Number 10 source said it was 'delighted' to appoint Mr Livingstone, who will be handed a peerage. The Banking Commission report has largely completed a purge on the shamed bosses who brought Britain's financial system to the edge of bankruptcy. Former HBOS chief James Crosby this month forfeited his knighthood and agreed to have his £580,000-a-year pension cut by a third. Fred Goodwin, who presided over the £45billion collapse of RBS, had his knighthood removed last year and is living on a reduced annual pension of £342,000. Barclays supremo Bob Diamond was ousted last year following the Libor interest rate-rigging scandal. The only banker of the credit crisis years still occupying a chief executive's chair is Andy Hornby, who runs bookmaker Gala Coral. The privately-owned betting firm last night said he has the full backing of the board. A Number 10 source insisted Lord Green's past stewardship of the bank had nothing to do with his decision to stand down as a minister. 'He has always made clear that he would leave after two or three years, by the time it gets to December he will have been there for around three years,' the source said. 'We are delighted that we have got someone of the stature of Ian Livingston to replace him.'","Lord Green quit his new role as a trade minister .

Britain's highest court has launched a stinging attack on secret justice, saying it is ‘not justice at all’. The president of the Supreme Court said that other than in exceptional circumstances judges should treat requests to hear cases in closed courts with ‘distaste and concern’. In a blow to ministers, Lord Neuberger said hearing evidence behind closed doors was ‘against the principle of justice’. He added that cases where one party was excluded from knowing the evidence against them were particularly ‘offensive’ and should happen only when they were ‘convincingly demonstrated to be genuinely necessary’. He spoke out during a case involving the Government and an Iranian bank accused of indirectly helping finance Teheran’s nuclear weapons programme. After a four-year fight Bank Mellat has successfully overturn an order, made by the Treasury under counter-terrorism legislation, which barred it from operating in the UK. The case represents a victory for the principle of open justice and the Mail’s campaigning against the introduction of courts that would hear some civil compensation cases in secret. Bosses of the bank had argued the 2009 order was unlawful as they had not been given a chance to fight their case before it was imposed and were not party to the evidence heard in secret. Their challenge led to the Supreme Court – for the first time – holding a closed hearing to consider a previous secret ruling made by High Court judges. Lord Neuberger said that a closed hearing was ‘even more offensive to the fundamental principle [of justice] than a private hearing’, where both parties are represented. ‘At least a private hearing cannot be said, of itself, to give rise to inequality or even unfairness as between the parties,’ he said. Fake justice: Lord Neuberger said secret justice cases heard behind closed doors at the Royal Courts of Justice were in fact 'not justice at all' ‘But that cannot be said of an . arrangement where the court can look at evidence and hear arguments on . behalf of one party without the other party knowing, or being able to . test, the contents of that evidence and those arguments, or even being . able to see all the reasons why the court has reached its conclusions.’ Lord Hope, deputy president of the Supreme Court, said secret justice ‘at this level’ was ‘really not justice at all’. After judges heard evidence behind closed . doors as part of Bank Mellat’s High Court challenge of  the 2009 order, . their secret judgment was then considered by the Court of Appeal. It . dismissed the bank’s challenge in 2011. But yesterday the order barring anyone in the UK financial sector working with Bank Mellat was overturned after the Supreme Court ruled that the Treasury order had been ‘demonstrably unfair’ in wrongly singling out Bank Mellat. The civil rights group Liberty praised the verdict. Corinna Ferguson, the group’s legal officer said: ‘Proud principles of  open justice and the rule of law are the casualties as the secret justice disease infects the highest court in the land. ‘Today’s chilling judgment brutally exposes the Government’s claims and lays bare its willingness to overstate the importance of secrecy to serve its own ends.’ She added: ‘Given recent revelations of spying and snooping it really does seem that it’s one rule for the state, another for everyone else – no scrutiny for them, no privacy for us.’ When the bank’s case reached the Supreme Court two lawyers joined justices at the private hearing. One was a barrister representing the Treasury. The other represented the interests of the bank but was not permitted to reveal what went on to the bank’s bosses or any of its staff. The Treasury is now likely to be liable for damages that could run to many millions of pounds.","Closed courts 'against principle of justice' say Supreme Court president .

PUBLISHED: . 19:17 EST, 15 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:01 EST, 20 June 2013 . Head of the Army, General Sir Peter Wall, is paid £180,000 and has a . flat in London as his official residence . Britain’s military top brass should sacrifice their ‘lavish lifestyles’ and move into council flats, a former government economist has said. In an attack on the ‘grotesque’ culture of grace-and-favour privileges enjoyed by senior officers – including heavily subsidised luxury apartments – the former Chief Economic Adviser to the Ministry of Defence says up to £1 billion can be saved. This could be done by cutting ‘questionable’ allowances to senior officers, axeing up to one in three posts above the rank of brigadier (or equivalent) and by procuring new aircraft carriers and submarines more efficiently. Neil Davies, who retired last year, rubbished suggestions by the head of the Army, General Sir Peter Wall, that any further cuts to the £34billion defence budget would jeopardise Britain’s ability to win wars. Mr Davies said: ‘Well, he would say that, wouldn’t he? As the head of the Army, General Wall is paid £180,000 and has a flat as his official residence. 'This is a lavish lifestyle and it is shared by a number of very senior officers in the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force. 'Senior officers say they require official residences in easy reach of Downing Street so they can be summoned to advise the Prime Minister at any time. 'In that case they could be found a council flat in Vauxhall – the point being that other properties could fill the same geographic criteria.

Favours: General Sir David Richards (circled left) and General Sir Peter Wall (circled right), with the Queen and the military top brass at the Armed Forces Parade and Muster in Home Park, Windsor, last year . ‘At the same time, many junior ranks’ accommodation resembles council estates. Some of these flats and houses are abysmal and the comparison between the treatment of those at the top and bottom ends of the Armed Forces is grotesque.’ General Sir David Richards, Chief of the Defence Staff, pays a token rent on Princess Diana’s former apartment in Kensington Palace and can live there with his wife Caroline for the duration of his time in office. The property reportedly costs the taxpayer £256,000 a year to run. The First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir George Zambellas – the most senior officer in the Royal Navy – has a luxury apartment in Admiralty Arch, just off Trafalgar Square. Remarkably, none of these Service chiefs is reported to pay more than £750 a month to rent these properties, and there are many other such officers in luxury properties. They may also claim for domestic assistance and some enjoy the services of personal chefs and drivers. In an exclusive interview with The Mail on Sunday, Mr Davies described visiting an eight-bedroom house at the Royal Naval base in Devonport, Plymouth, which was maintained for entertaining guests by the Rear Admiral commanding ‘FOST’ – the Flag Officer Sea Training establishment. The First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir George Zambellas - the most senior officer in the Royal Navy - has a luxury apartment in Admiralty Arch, just off Trafalgar Square . He said it was fitted out with antiques and grand paintings like a country hotel, all at public expense. ‘The Rear Admiral admitted he and his wife hadn’t liked living there so they had moved to a much smaller place nearby, but their huge house was maintained for guests of FOST,’ he said. ‘What we have is a relic of the 1920s class system in the Armed Forces that is perpetuated through a package of privileges and remuneration to senior officers which they couldn’t maintain in civilian life and is denied even to senior officials in the diplomatic service.’ Mr Davies also said many of these officers were doing little more than ‘manning desks’ in Whitehall and that one in three could be removed from the command chain without remotely damaging Britain’s chances of winning future wars. He said: ‘All three Services are top-heavy with senior officers, even in comparison to the US military, which is hardly an example of efficiency. Many are replicating each other’s jobs. ‘We would be better off amalgamating the three Services at the level of high-ranking commanders to end this duplication. This would mean the Armed Forces wouldn’t need to retain and promote so many officers in order to compete for the top jobs.’ The MoD's ex-Chief Economic Adviser, Neil Davies, said: 'Senior officers say . they require official residences in easy reach of Downing Street so they . can be summoned to advise the PM at any time. In that case they could . be found a council flat in Vauxhall'. Above, Kensington Palace . Mr Davies said politicians and civilian officials were reluctant to challenge the generals and admirals over their packages because they would have to put their own pay deals and perks under similar scrutiny. ‘At the end of the last Labour government a report was commissioned into these privileges. It was intended to highlight the cost of official residences and vehicles and the lifestyles but it was never published and effectively buried,’ he said. On procurement, Mr Davies suggested the MoD was restricted by its relationship with the British defence industry, with companies such as BAE Systems enjoying a ‘feather-bedded monopoly’. ‘BAE won a contract to build the Astute attack-class submarines after offering a price that it simply could not afford. So it went cap in hand to the MoD claiming that it would have to default on the order unless the MoD coughed up more money. BAE are untouchable.’ An MoD spokesman said: ‘Senior ranks do not just fulfil command positions in the three services, they also hold senior management roles  . . . as well as positions in UK embassies, NATO and other coalition headquarters around the world.’ ... as No. 10 goes to war on 'luxury' Army budget . Britain can no longer expect to punch ‘way above its weight’ on military spending, David Cameron has told Defence Secretary Philip Hammond. The warning comes as the MoD fights to avoid deep cuts in this month’s spending review. Mr Hammond has angered No10 by refusing to sign up to any reductions that might damage frontline capabilities. Britain can no longer expect to punch 'way above its weight' on military spending, David Cameron has told Defence Secretary Philip Hammond (right) But he has been warned in stark terms by Mr Cameron that the MoD’s £34 billion budget should be regarded as generous because it is the fourth largest in the world – even though the UK economy is only sixth. The French, who are sixth in the defence pecking order, spend £8 billion less than the British. America accounts for 40 per cent of global defence spending with an annual £436 billion budget. China is second, with £106 billion, while Russia is third on £57 billion. Mr Cameron said that the Chancellor is demanding ‘just’ £1.6 billion to be trimmed from  the MoD. Mr Hammond responded by saying he would try to find ‘efficiency savings’ but would not slash deep into manpower or equipment budgets. The exchanges between Mr Cameron and Mr Hammond took place as negotiations continue between the MoD and the Treasury ahead of the spending review on June 26. A Whitehall source said:  ‘Mr Cameron is proud of that fact we have such powerful, well-resourced Armed Forces. But he wanted Philip to be aware that  it is something of a luxury when there is a such a pressing need to trim spending.’ The MoD has been at the centre of some of the most public, and acrimonious, exchanges about the spending review, with the head of the Army, General Sir Peter Wall, warning that cuts could endanger soldiers’ lives. Sir Peter argued it would be dangerous to lose more troops when the Army is already  being reduced from 102,000 to 82,000 personnel. ‘Imposing more on us now before the last round of efficiencies have materialised properly in a balanced way would be very disruptive,’ he said.

A spurned husband killed his wife by battering her with an ornamental elephant, a court heard. Devendra Singh used the wooden figure to attack Charlotte Smith with 'extreme force and extreme violence' after the 42-year-old told him she wanted a divorce, the jury was told. Philip Bennetts QC, prosecuting, said Miss Smith's skull was repeatedly 'smashed and shattered' in the attack last September. He described the level of violence used against her as 'off the scale'. Singh, 33, admits killing his wife – who worked as a health and safety  manager – but denies murder, claiming he suffered a 'loss of control'. The court heard he beat his wife of two years with the 4lb wooden object after an argument at their home in Leek, Staffordshire. Mr Bennetts said: 'Many of the blows were delivered with a heavy implement – an ornamental elephant which the defendant picked up and used to strike her repeatedly to the face and head.' Miss Smith was said to have died as a result of 'sustained and extreme blunt force trauma'. Mr Bennetts added: 'Bone was smashed and shattered time and time again. 'The amount of force used was effectively off the scale. It was beyond severe – it was extreme.'  Following the attack, Singh is accused of leaving his wife's body on their living room floor and leaving the house, taking her mobile phone SIM card with him. It was alleged that he cleaned up and threw evidence – including  the wooden elephant – over the garden fence into a field, before fleeing to London. He is said to have put Miss Smith's SIM into his own phone and sent texts to her family and friends – including her father, Peter Smith – pretending to be her. Stafford Crown Court heard Mr Smith discovered his daughter's body on the floor of her living room three days later. Singh returned to Leek that same day and handed himself in to police. Mr Smith, 65, told how his daughter and son-in-law had lunch at  his home just a day before Miss Smith was killed. Police officers at the house in Leek where the body of Charlotte Smith was found . Giving evidence on the first day of . the trial on Tuesday, Mr Smith said: 'We had a really great time. We . were talking about holidays and parties. When they left everything was . OK. 'We were planning to go on holiday to Goa in November.' Miss Smith met Singh during a previous holiday in the Indian state with her father in 2008. They began a relationship and married in Goa in December 2010, and after waiting for a visa, Singh moved to the UK. The court heard the Smith family opened a town centre shop for  him to run when he could not  find work. But prosecutors said by last summer the relationship was failing, and Singh had become prone to heavy drinking and aggression. Mr Smith said: 'Charlotte wasn't happy . in the situation. She said she was finding it difficult living with . someone. I saw the end was coming.' Forensic teams search for evidence after the body was found inside last September . Singh told police Miss Smith had been . violent towards him and that she had picked up a knife during the . argument, the court heard. But Mr Bennetts said: 'Even if you . accept that happened, the prosecution case is that none of that could . ever begin to justify what he did to her that day.' Miss Smith, who was known as Charlie, . told work colleagues Singh had grabbed her around the neck during an . argument four months before she died. Craig Ferns, who worked with her at . Leek-based chemical manufacturer Polynt UK, said of the incident in May . last year: 'She told me at one point he had hold of her around the neck. 'I do not know how she stopped him holding her neck but she rang her father to come round and defuse the situation.'

'She told me he changed when he had been drinking and was not a particularly nice person,' he said. The trial continues.

A new study is now being conducted by Plantlife Scotland, in conjunction with the commission and Scottish Natural Heritage, to ensure it is preserved for the future in Scotland. A spokesman for Plantlife Scotland said: ‘Juniper is in serious trouble. One of only three native conifers in Britain, not only does it face a new deadly fungal disease, Phytophthora austrocedrae, it has also disappeared from over one-third of Britain.’ The organisation is calling on the public to contribute to its research project and help determine the loss of the berry.

It may be the feeling of freedom that comes with no longer having to work, but the over-65s are almost as satisfied with their health as they were in their late 30s, according to the figures. The Office for National Statistics found people’s sense of health and wellbeing are generally on a ‘downward trend’ from their teens until late middle age, before receiving a welcome bounce in their 60s. And it appeared that even the 70s are a far happier time than the miserable slog of the 40s and 50s. As part of a wider study of 40,000 households in 2010 to 2011, people were asked to rate how satisfied they were with their overall health.

Passenger satisfaction with Britain’s crowded, late-running and over-priced railway network has plummeted to the lowest level in six years, a damning new survey by official watchdogs reveals. One in eight passengers are unhappy with their unreliable rail services at a time of inflation-busting fare rises and bumper bonuses for rail bosses. Only four out of ten - 42 per cent - believe train companies give value for money while just 38 per cent are satisfied with their ability to deal with delays. The report by consumer watchdog Passenger Focus said rail companies are ‘failing to deliver on their basic promises’ to deliver a reliable time-table and that train travellers deserved a better deal. Delays: Passenger anger at delayed train services and rocketing ticket prices is at its highest level in six years . Train bosses admitted there was ‘room for improvement’ while ministers said they ‘share passengers' concerns over punctuality.’ Nationally, just 78 per cent of passengers are satisfied with punctuality and reliability of their train services – down three per cent since spring 2012. It is the highest level of passenger dissatisfaction with rail networks in six years since 2007 when just 77 per cent of passengers were happy with punctuality. Commuters in London and the South East are the most unhappy with punctuality with only three-quarters - 76 per cent- satisfied, compared to 83 per cent on long-distance routes and 81 per cent on regional services. The damning Passenger Focus report showed that just 42 per cent of passengers believe their train journey provides ‘value for money’, with the figure dropping to 38 per cent on London and south east England services. Survey results: The majority of passengers surveyed by Passenger Focus said the reliability of their train service and they way rail companies deal with delays is the biggest problem . But on one of the worst performing lines, Greater Anglia's Stansted Express route, five . out of six passengers said it fails to give value for money. Only 17 . per cent of passengers rated their ticket's value for money as being . satisfactory or good. By contrast, as many as 76 per cent . of Grand Central passengers rated the company's London to Bradford . service as satisfactory or good in the value-for-money category. Nationally, the percentage of passengers satisfied with their journey overall was 82 per cent compared with 83 per cent in a similar survey in spring 2012, while the figure in an autumn 2012 survey was 85 per cent. The lowest-scoring operators for overall . satisfaction in the latest survey were Northern and First Capital . Connect which both had figures of 76 per cent. The highest-scoring . company was First Hull Trains with 95 per cent. Unhappy: Overall satisfaction on individual routes around the UK varied between 62 and 95 per cent . Earlier this month the Office of Rail Regulation revealed that millions of passengers are being failed by delayed and cancelled trains because Network Rail missed all of its punctuality targets across England and Wales. Passenger . Focus chief executive Anthony Smith said: ‘Passengers faced variable . performance in the early part of 2013. There continues to be a wide gap . between the better and weaker performing services - satisfaction with . individual operators ranges from 76 per cent to 95 per cent.' He added: ‘Value for money by route is even more striking, with satisfaction levels ranging from 17 per cent  to 76 per cent. Mr . Smith added: ‘Passengers are now the main overall funder of Great . Britain's railway, so it is vital that their key needs are met. ‘Given . that performance is the key factor that underpins most passengers' general view of the railway, train companies and Network Rail must keep . striving to get more trains on time.’ Passenger . Focus said rail users had faced performance issues caused by poor . weather, track and signalling problems, suicides and congestion on the . network but that it was ‘day to day’ performance that was giving cause . for concern. It added that on a positive note, cable theft has become much rarer following crackdowns. Overall satisfaction by individual routes within train companies' areas varied between 62 per cent and 95 per cent. On . value for money, the proportion of passengers satisfied with value for . money for the price of their ticket was 42 per cent - the same as in spring . 2012. On overcrowding, . satisfaction with sufficient room for all passengers to sit or stand fell . from 69 per cent in spring 2012 to 67 per cent in spring 2013. Over-crowding: Overall 33 per cent of passengers are unhappy with the level of over-crowding on their rail network . Office . of Rail Regulation chairman Anna Walker said: ‘It is very disappointing . that passenger satisfaction with punctuality and reliability has . fallen. 'While some passengers . enjoy excellent performance, others suffer significant delays and . disruptions. The range of satisfaction is between 95 per cent and 55 per cent. All . passengers need reliable services. That is why we have set more . stretching targets for the next five years. Nine out of ten trains on . time needs to be the minimum standard.' In some areas, passengers were happier than in spring last year. Satisfaction . with station facilities and services rose from 50 per cent to 55 per cent, while . satisfaction with station cleanliness was up 3 per cent at 74 per cent. Satisfaction . with station upkeep and repair increased two percentage points to 70 per cent and . satisfaction with connections with other forms of public transport also . rose two per cent to 75 per cent. David . Mapp, commercial director at the Association of Train Operating . Companies, said: ‘Train companies know that to be successful they must . meet the needs of passengers and deliver high levels of satisfaction and . value for money. ‘While these . results show that there is room for improvement, passengers are voting . with their feet and taking more journeys than at any time since the . 1920s on newer trains, with more services arriving punctually.’ Rail . Minister Norman Baker said: ‘While passenger satisfaction remains . generally high, I share passengers' concerns over punctuality. The . Government is investing record amounts into upgrading the railways, and . the industry must make sure that investment translates into improvements . on the ground.’ Can't get no satisfaction: This graph shows how passengers' satisfaction with different aspects of their train services has fallen in since last year . He added: ‘I . recognise there are areas where satisfaction is low such as fares, . which is why we are currently undertaking a review of fares and . ticketing so we can start to end the era of above-inflation fare rises.’ Bob Crow, general secretary of the RMT transport union, said: 'These appalling figures on passenger satisfaction show clearly that the travelling public is sick and tired of paying through the nose to travel on crowded, unreliable trains while the private operating companies are raking in a fortune in profits.’ Shadow transport secretary Maria Eagle said: ""Passengers have every reason to be dissatisfied when rail fares are going up by as much as 9% a year while delayed and cancelled trains are on the rise.’ She added:’Only last month, rail bosses awarded themselves bonuses on the basis of what they claimed was rising passenger satisfaction, yet these latest figures must surely call those payments into question.’ ‘Ministers should now urgently work with the rail regulator to require a change to Network Rail's remuneration scheme so that only actual improvements in performance that benefit passengers are rewarded.’ Richard Hebditch, campaigns director for the Campaign for Better Transport, said: ‘Passengers are unhappy about the value they get for their tickets. With the review of fares due, now is the time for Government to end above-inflation ticket price hikes.’ The Passenger Focus Spring survey . report was based on feedback from more 30,000 passengers on 30 . specific aspects of their train service.

"Cardinal Paolo Romeo said . to have revealed details on a visit to China . Another . cardinal then submitted a top-secret . report to the Vatican Secretary of State . By . Nick Pisa . UPDATED: . 14:48 EST, 10 February 2012 . A senior Vatican cardinal has sensationally claimed Pope Benedict XVI could be ‘the victim of an assassination plot’ within the next 12 months, it emerged today. Cardinal Paolo Romeo is said to have revealed the details while on a visit to China and that another cardinal who was told of the comments, then submitted a top secret report to the Vatican Secretary of State. The plot, which could come straight out of a Dan Brown-style thriller, was revealed in Italian newspaper Il Fatto Quotidiano today. Pope Benedict XVI, pictured yesterday at the Vatican, could be 'the victim of an assassination plot' within the next 12 months, a senior Vatican cardinal has sensationally claimed . Cardinal Paolo Romeo (seen left last year in the Vatican), who is Archbishop of Palermo, is said to have made the claims during his visit to China last November where he met with Italian businessmen and local Catholic Church officials . Cardinal Romeo, who is Archbishop of Palermo, is said to have made the claims during his visit to China last November where he met with Italian businessmen and local Catholic Church officials. The Catholic Church is not officially recognised in China and relations between the two are strained but in November, Pope Benedict did grant approval for the ordination of a new bishop which was accepted by the Bejing government. Il Fatto claimed that Cardinal Romeo told the businessmen that there was a ‘death plot' against the Pope and that he would be 'dead within twelve months', the end of the year at the latest but it was not clear where he had obtained the information. His comments were then relayed back . to another cardinal in Rome, Colombian-born Dario Castrillon who wrote . up the report and submitted to the Secretary of State, cardinal Tarcisio . Bertone. Startling news: The plot was revealed in Italian newspaper Il Fatto Quotidiano which published a 'very confidential' document dated 30 December 2011 said to had been given to retired Colombian Cardinal Dario Castrillon . The newspaper claimed that the report was 'translated into German' so as to keep the sensationally revelations as quiet as possible within the Vatican but it was submitted to German born Pope Benedict XVI as well. Cardinal Romeo, 73, has a long career as a Vatican diplomat and has worked in the Philippines, Belgium, Luxembourg, Venezuela and Rwanda and he was also the Vatican’s official ambassador to Italy between 2001 and 2006, when he was made a cardinal by Pope Benedict. Il Fatto said that it had been leaked a copy of the report and that the German words for ‘death plot’ were in it and they added that they had verified it was original by the Vatican rubber stamps that were on the pages. They also went on to detail how cardinal Romeo had even said that a successor for Pope Benedict was also being lined up and named him as cardinal Angelo Scola, the current archbishop of Milan. Il Fatto added that cardinal Romeo had 'seriously predicted a criminal plot against the pope and that he would be dead within twelve months' and that the report had been written on New Year’s Eve and then passed to the Pope last month. In 1981 late Pope John Paul II, who died in 2005, was the victim of an assassination attempt when Turkish hit man Mehmet Ali Agca (circled) fired at him from close range, as he greeted crowds in St Peter's Square . Il Fatto deputy editor Marco Travaglio said:' We are happy the report is a genuine Vatican document and that the details are accurate as we reported them. 'Obviously we hope that it is not true but the words death plot are clearly there in German and it was written in German so that only a handful of people within the Vatican knew the details.' Today Vatican spokesman father Federico Lombardi tried to downplay the report saying that it seemed to him ,to be ‘’beyond the realms of reality and not even worth considering""'. In 1978 Pope John Paul I died after just 33 days in office and there have long been suggestions that he was poisoned by the Mafia after they discovered he was about to name senior Catholic church officials who were involved in money laundering for the Mob. In 1981 late Pope John Paul II, who died in 2005, was the victim of an assassination attempt when Turkish hit man Mehmet Ali Agca fired at him from close range, as he greeted crowds in St Peter’s Square. The Pope was rushed to hospital where he underwent life saving surgery and he went on to make a full recovery, putting his survival down to the intervention of the Virgin Mary and later one of the bullets removed during the operation was placed at a shrine to her in Fatima, Portugal. In 1991 comedian Robbie Coltrane starred in a film called The Pope Must Die, in which he played a lowly priest who is mistakenly elected Pope and then has to avoid being assassinated by the Mafia. Over the years, many popes have met a grisly demise - by . strangulation, poisoning, crucifixion, and even by being clubbed to . death. Much of the bloodshed occurred during the Middle Ages. But as the . death of John Paul I in 1978 shows - if conspiracy theories are to be . believed - with great responsibility comes great danger... St Peter (AD 64): Crucified. John VIII (872-882): Allegedly poisoned and then clubbed to death. Adrian III (884-885): Allegedly poisoned. Stephen VI (896-897): Said to have been strangled. Pope Benedict XI, who reigned in 1304-5, was allegedly poisoned . Leo V (903): Murdered. John X (914-928): Allegedly suffocated under a pillow. Stephen VII (928-931): Possibly murdered. Stephen VIII (939-942): Mutilated and died from injuries. John XII (955-964): Murdered by cuckolded husband. Pope John VIII (872-882) is said to have poisoned and then clubbed to death; right, Stephen VI (896-897) is alleged to have been strangled . Benedict VI (973-974): Strangled by a priest. John XIV (983-984): Starved to death or poisoned. Gregory V (996-999): Said to have been poisoned but probably malaria. Sergius IV (1009-1012): Possibly murdered. Clement II (1046-1047): Rumored poisoned. Damasus II (1048): Rumored murdered. Boniface VIII (1294-1303): Died from abuse received while a captive of the French in Anagni. Benedict XI (1304-1305): Allegedly poisoned. John Paul I (1978): Allegedly poisoned.

Parents should not let children have televisions or computers in their bedrooms, an education minister said last night. During a debate in Parliament about the harmful impact of pornography on youngsters, Lord Nash said that unfortunately it was a ‘fact of life’ that parents gave their children such free rein. The junior schools minister said he was concerned that many parents simply ‘do not understand’ that their children can access such ‘dreadful’ hard core material on the internet. Parents should not let children have televisions or computers in their bedrooms, an education minister said last night . His comments follow concerns that porn is too easily available on the web and that there is little to stop children with TVs in their bedroom watching adult programmes shown after the watershed. There are also fears that children are not playing out enough because they spend too much time playing on computers or watching TV in their rooms - fuelling child obesity. Peers lined up to attack the government for its failure at Tuesday’s internet safety summit to force web firms to automatically block online porn. Campaigners want over-18s only to able to see adult images if they specifically opt in following a strict age verification check. Baroness Benjamin, the former Play School presenter, said ministers’ failure could see children ending up in a ‘moral wasteland’. During the question and answer session in the House of Lords, Lord Nash was asked by 90-year-old Tory peer Baroness Sharples: ‘Why do parents allow children to have computers in their room, even encourage them?’ During a debate in Parliament about the harmful impact of pornography on youngsters, Lord Nash said that unfortunately it was a 'fact of life' that parents gave their children such free rein . The minister strongly concurred, replying: ‘Or televisions, for that matter. I agree.’ He hinted that children do not play out enough nowadays, and spend too much time on their computers in their rooms - saying they now learn about what is outside their front door from the web. Lord Nash said: ‘However, it is a fact of life these days, I am afraid, that the internet is the “pavement” for our children. That is why this is such an important issue, and parents do not understand enough about it.’ Baroness Benjamin, a Lib Dem peer, warned that children are now ‘re-enacting pornographic behaviour’ because of what they see on the web. The former children’s presenter, a familiar face in the 1980s, condemned the government for being too weak with internet giants at this week’s summit. The top web firms have agreed to ask new customers if they want anti-porn filters by the end of the year - but this does extend to existing customers. Baroness Benjamin asked: ‘Why is the government not insisting they should be offering filtering for their existing customers and block porn and adult material by default as part of the solution to protect all children before they end up in a moral wasteland?’ She said that children are particularly vulnerable from parent-less households and parents who do not care. ‘No amount of awareness education will do anything for these kids,’ she said. Lord Nash replied: ‘The fact that it is so easy for our children to access these dreadful images is shocking. ‘We also want the ISPs to check that the person setting up the parental controls is over the age of 18. The five main domestic ISPs that cover 90 per cent of households in the UK have committed to ensure that these measures are in place for existing as well as new customers by the end of this year.’ He added that wi-fi in public places would soon also have automatic filters and work is under way to place parental controls on device manufacturers and retailers.","Debate in Parliament about harmful impact of pornography on youngsters .

It's been going for just three days and 115 miles but the Olympic Torch Relay has already burnt out, organisers confirmed today. Shortly before 10am the torch that was attached to the side of Para-badminton star David Follett's wheelchair went out during his leg of the relay in Great Torrington, Devon. But just up the road in Hatherleigh, an extremely unofficial torch kept burning despite the wind. Looking rather perilous against a row of thatched cottages, the flaming fireball on a stick was paraded through the small market town in the locally organised event. Back in Great Torrington, a spokeswoman for LOCOG said: 'The flame went out due to a malfunctioning burner. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

Not uncommon: A spokeswoman for LOCOG said it was not uncommon for . a flame to go out and the torch is simply re-lit from the mother flame carried alongside . ...Meanwhile: Just up the road in Hatherleigh, an extremely unofficial torch kept burning despite the wind . Retired farmer Tony Hill is 64 years late for his Olympic Torch Relay duties. The 86-year-old from Wiveliscombe, Devon, had been due to carry the flame ahead of the 1948 London Games but was struck down with appendicitis. As the torch came through Taunton in Somerset that year he was on the operating table. But today a healthy Mr Hill held the golden torch aloft during his leg of the relay through Barnstaple in Devon. It had been 'an honour' he said. Speaking about missing out in 1948, Mr Hill added: 'I was in the Southern Counties cross-country championships in Kent a few days before and collapsed with appendicitis. 'I never thought I'd get another chance when I was in East Reach Hospital on the day I was meant to be carrying the torch in 1948.' 'It is not uncommon for a flame to go out and this can happen for a number of reasons, for example, in extreme winds. 'A replacement torch was brought out from the convoy of vehicles and was lit from the mother flame. 'We keep the mother flame in specially designed miners' lanterns so if the flame does go out for some reason on the relay we relight it from the source of the flame,' the spokeswoman added. Mr Follett was left paralysed at 19 when he was struck by a car. But after returning to college to complete his A Levels he looked at what sports were available to wheelchair athletes and helped to set up a badminton club. With his playing partner, Follett has been unbeaten for three years in the four nations competitions and he is now the Para-badminton world No 1 in his class. The torch relay entered its third day today and will see dozens of unsung and hard-working individuals get their moment in the spotlight as they carry the torch from Exeter to Taunton. However, some of the Olympic torchbearers have caused a stir after cashing in on their once-in-a-lifetime privilege by selling their torches on eBay. Before the first day of the relay was completed, the gold torches appeared on the online auction site.A torch used during the relay on Saturday is currently attracting bids of more than £30,000. The seller lists the item as: 'An amazing sporting souvenir, be one of the first to have one!' Other torchbearers have pledged to donate the proceeds from the sale to charity. Sarah Milner Simonds, from Burnham-on-Sea, who is selling her torch to raise money for the project she represents, said she had received a bid of more than £150,000. Ms Milner said she still needed to check if the bid was genuine. 'It only occurred to me to do it on Saturday night,' she told BBC Breakfast. 'The sale closed last night at 10pm and the final bid was £153,000.' The torchbearer, who was nominated for her work as a community gardener for the People's Plot, said she was dismayed that people who objected to her decision had started sending her abusive emails. Torch fever: The crowds were back today to watch Georgina Geikie carrying the Olympic Torch on the leg between Okehampton and Merton in Devon . We want the torch!

Patience: A British bulldog decked out in red, white and blue waits patiently for the touch in Bideford, left, while right, crowds gather on a bridge between Torquay and Teignmouth . 'Obviously it has really upset people but I think that it's not something that is really me to keep my shiny trophy on a mantelpiece when it is obvious how much good one can do with the money that someone might be willing to pay for it.' Organisers will be hoping for a repeat of the scenes on the first two days of the relay when excited people packed the streets of Cornwall and Devon to catch a glimpse of the torch. Yesterday began at the Plymouth Life Centre with the torch in the hands of 18-year-old Jordan Anderton. The relay travelled from Plymouth, through Totnes, Paignton and Torquay on the south Devon coast, before finishing in Exeter for an evening celebration. More than 8,500 people filled Exeter Cathedral Gardens to watch a live show of music and dance. Away from the official Olympic Torch Relay, residents in Hatherleigh, Devon got on with some burning of their own. But perhaps holding a flaming fireball on a stick close to a row of pretty thatched cottages was not quite a gold medal idea. As crowds of local residents lined the streets of the small market town clapping the unofficial torch bearers down the street, thick black smoke filled the air. Luckily the event passed without incident. And what's more the unofficial torch, which must have cost a fraction of the £495 price of a golden cheese grater, did not malfunction, despite the wind.

Federal agents have arrested more than 90 people and seized about five million packets of synthetic drugs, known on the street as bath salts, K2 and Spice. The operation is the first U.S. nationwide crackdown on 'designer drugs', the Drug Enforcement Administration said yesterday. The DEA said the haul from multi-agency raids in more than 100 U.S. cities included 4.8million packets of synthetic cannabis, 167,000 packets of 'bath salts' and more than $36million in cash. Operation Log Jam: Federal agents have arrested more than 90 people and seized about five million packets of synthetic drugs, known on the street as bath salts, K2 and Spice . Operation Log Jam involved the DEA, five federal agencies, state and local police. DEA Administrator Michele Leonhart said in a statement: 'It has disrupted the entire illegal industry, from manufacturers to retailers. 'Together . with our federal, state and local law enforcement partners, we are . committed to targeting these new and emerging drugs with every . scientific, legislative and investigative tool at our disposal.' Synthetic drugs - with street names . like bath salts or plant food - mimic more traditional illegal narcotics . like cocaine, LSD, MDMA and methamphetamine, and have rapidly grown in . popularity. Bath salts have been blamed in several incidents of erratic and violent behaviour across the U.S. Smokable herbal blends marketed as . Spice, K2, Blaze, and Red X Dawn and labelled as incense contain illegal . psychoactive compounds that mimic THC, the active ingredient in . marijuana. Bath salts are likely to be stimulant drugs such MPDV or ephedrine. Bath salts does not refer to a single chemical, but instead to a range of synthetic drugs that can be sold legally in the U.S. as long as they are not marked for human consumption – hence the misleading name. Drugs such as MPDV are highly potent stimulants, similar to some amphetamines, and in MPDV's case particularly, cause a strong compulsion to 'redose' with more of the drug. In high doses, such drugs can cause violent and unpredictable behaviour, and terrifying hallucinations – and the compulsion to take more of the drug continues, even once the 'high' has begun to make the user feel bad. They have become popular among teens and young adults. New research suggests the drug affects the brain in the same way as cocaine. The drug's active ingredient is mephedrone. Scientists have shown that mephedrone acts the same way as cocaine in the brain - giving it the potential for abuse and addiction. Studies were conducted on mice using a technique developed in the 1950s - intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) - that measures a drug's ability to activate reward circuits. In ICSS studies, animals are trained to perform a behavioural task - pressing a lever or button with their nose or spinning a wheel - to receive a reward. Mice were implanted with brain stimulating electrodes, with measures of their wheel spinning effort made before, during and after they received various doses of either mephedrone or cocaine. Dr Carl Malanga, of the University of North Carolina, explained: 'One of the unique features of ICSS is that all drugs of abuse, regardless of how they work pharmacologically, do very similar things to ICSS: they make ICSS more rewarding.' Results of the Behavioural Brain Research study showed cocaine increased the ability of mice to be rewarded by self-stimulation and mephedrone did the same. On July 9, President Barack Obama signed into law legislation passed by Congress to permanently ban the sale of bath salts in the U.S. 'Bath salts' have been implicated in a recent spate of violent attacks across the U.S.: .","Operation is first U.S. nationwide crackdown on 'designer drugs'

A new check for cervical cancer is far more effective than the traditional smear test, say doctors. Thousands of young women’s lives could be saved by the new procedure. Early trials have shown it detects affected cells before they are able to develop into cancer. A light micrograph showing cervical cancer cells. Early trials have shown a new test can detect affected cells before they develop into cancer . Unlike the current smear test, women . would be able to carry out the procedure in their own homes, saving . themselves the embarrassment of having it done at a surgery or hospital. The new test costs £30 but researchers believe the price would be reduced considerably if it was rolled out across the NHS. They also calculate it would save the . health service £50million a year because women would need to have the . test less frequently than smears, which are carried out every three to . five years. Cervical cancer most commonly affects women aged between 25 and 50 and there are about 2,800 cases every year. Women would provide a sample similar to a smear test which is then sent to a lab . But there are often no symptoms early on and in many cases the illness is only picked up in the advanced stages when it may be too difficult to treat. Last year the cancer caused 936 deaths and hundreds of other women had to have chemotherapy and surgery for late-stage tumours which may have left them infertile. The do-it-yourself test detects the human papilloma virus (HPV) which causes tumours. Women would provide a sample – similar to a smear – which is then sent to a lab. If they are found to have the virus, they would be invited back for more frequent screening every year or 18 months. Those who didn’t have the virus would not have to have another test for six years. Crucially, the test can also pick up pre-cancerous tumours which are often not detected by smears. Women would then be able to have surgery to remove these growths before they developed into cancer. Researchers . from Queen Mary, University of London calculate that the procedure – . known as primary HPV testing – could save the lives of 150 women a year. They looked at the records of 8,750 women aged 25-64 diagnosed with cervical cancer between 2007 and 2012. Around 40 per cent had undergone a smear test within the previous six years which had come back clear. The researchers then calculated how many cancers could have been avoided had women been given the new test. They believe it would prevent a third of cervical cancers – 1,000 a year – and at least 150 deaths. Professor Peter Sasieni, who carried out the study, said: ‘We are talking about the lives of young women here. Women in their 30s, 40s, 50s and in rare cases their 20s. ‘Many are mothers with young children, somebody’s wife or daughter. ‘We cannot delay. Over a decade that is 1,500 deaths.’ He added: ‘Cervical cancer screening is already hugely effective but our study shows how much more effective it could be by swapping to primary HPV testing. Not only would introducing primary HPV testing prevent more cases of cancer, it would also mean women who tested negative wouldn’t need to be checked as often.’ The findings, published in the Journal of Medical Screening today,  were presented at the National Cancer Intelligence Network Conference in Brighton. A pilot of the new test was launched last month and over the next year 100,000 will be invited to have the procedure at centres in Liverpool, north-west London, Sheffield, Bristol and Norwich. The results will be published next year. If it proves a success, the test will be available on the NHS, although the approval process may take three or four years. It would be offered to women aged 25-64, the same group who undergo the current smear tests.Although women will be encouraged to have the procedure done at a surgery or hospital, they could provide samples they take themselves at home. Only this week NHS figures revealed that a third of women in their late twenties were ignoring doctors’ advice to come forward for smear tests.","Women would be able to carry out the procedure in their own homes .

Little ground breaker: Heath Kidd is the first baby to be born using a new IVF treatment . He's only seven weeks old, but little Heath Kidd is already a pioneer. His birth – the result of a groundbreaking technique dubbed ‘the natural IVF’ – could offer hope to thousands of women who are currently unable to have children. While conventional IVF involves the mother being injected with artificial hormones, baby Heath was conceived with a new method that uses a naturally occurring hormone, kisspeptin. This helps produce eggs in a safer way for the mother and avoids some of the risks associated with traditional IVF. Heath’s mother Suzannah said she was thrilled with her ‘groundbreaker’ baby, who was born in April weighing 7.5lb after a ‘normal, healthy pregnancy’. And while Mrs Kidd is the first to give birth, ten more women are expecting babies following the breakthrough study at Hammersmith Hospital’s IVF unit in West London, conducted with Imperial College, London. Experts hope the treatment could be widely available in as little as two years. ‘We are over-the-moon to have Heath,’ Mrs Kidd said. ‘We feel so lucky to have him. 'It shows it does work and to know that we have helped move IVF treatment on is great.’ Mrs Kidd, 34, had tried for years to get pregnant after marrying husband Calum, 31, a project manager for a construction firm in 2008, but with no success. After being diagnosed with ‘unexplained’ fertility problems and referred for conventional IVF on the NHS at Hammersmith Hospital, Mrs Kidd, who works as a credit manager, became pregnant with son Lochlann, now two, in March 2011. Although they longed for another baby they were not entitled to any further rounds of IVF on the NHS. Bundle of joy: Heath, seven weeks, with his parents, Suzannah and Calum Kidd and older brother Lochlann . New technique: Compared to traditional IVF treatment, where artificial hormones are used, which the Kidds underwent with two year old Lochlann, Heath was conceived using natural hormones . The pair were attempting to save the £6,000 required to pay for the treatment privately when Mrs Kidd spotted a poster advertising the new kisspeptin IVF trial at Hammersmith Hospital and phoned straight away to see if she was eligible. Conventional IVF uses injections of high levels of ovary-stimulating drugs to mature eggs faster for collection. But there are well-recognised risks to the mother if the ovaries are over-stimulated, known as ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. This can endanger her life by leaking excess fluid into other parts of the body, leading to blood clots. The risks are particularly serious for women with polycystic ovaries. Kisspeptin is a naturally occurring hormone that researchers suspected could be successfully used as a safer way to induce a woman’s eggs to mature and become ripe for fertilisation. In normal pregnancies the body produces a surge of luteinizing hormone (LH), which supports egg maturation and triggers ovulation. In traditional IVF an injection of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) mimics this. However, it can overstimulate the ovaries in women at high risk, especially those with polycystic ovaries. The Kisspeptin, which has been produced in a synthetic form by the researchers, acts on the pituitary gland and sets off this LH surge. She began to receive the trial treatment in July last year. 'I didn’t notice any difference at all from when I had the conventional IVF with Lochlann,’ she said. A fertilised embryo was implanted within days of the final injection and Mrs Kidd discovered she was pregnant just three weeks later. The study looked at the effectiveness of using kisspeptin to induce egg development in place of conventional hormone injections. In regular IVF, the hormone injections that are used for egg development can trigger a serious condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). This results in over-stimulation of the ovaries – causing too many eggs to be released. In some rare cases, this condition can even lead to death. Those most at risk are women who cannot have children because they have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). As many as one in 12 women has PCOS, in which the polycystic ovary has tiny cysts around the outside, thought to be follicles that have failed to develop properly to release an egg. For those women, this safer treatment is a major breakthrough. Professor Waljit Dhillo, of Imperial College, said: ‘The results of the study are very encouraging and whilst we are primarily looking at women most at risk of developing OHSS, there is the potential kisspeptin could be used across all IVF treatments  as a more natural alternative.’","New IVF technique using naturally occurring hormone kisspeptin .

With the help of family and friends, it took just 10 days to organise the wedding they had dreamed about. Last October Charlotte organised a last minute wedding to terminally-ill boyfriend Chris Clark. He proposed within minutes of being diagnosed with incurable stomach cancer . Charlotte, 30, had made an online scrapbook of her dream wedding months before Chris's illness, which helped her with a speedy wedding turnaround.

After a series of tests, Chris, a photographer, was diagnosed with secondary cancer in July 2012. Charlotte and Chris were married in October October 2012 at St Gregory's Church in Offchurch, Warwickshire. Before getting married she had already made a scrapbook of her perfect wedding . Charlotte said that their engagement was always going to happen, it was only a question of when. After his proposal, Chris broached the idea of a quick register office ceremony, but Charlotte wanted to have her dream rural church wedding .

Chris . and Charlotte were sitting in a hospital waiting room five minutes . later, in a state of shock, when he turned to her and popped the . question. Then just minutes after, he was in a hospital bed undergoing another round of gruelling tests. Charlotte said the big day was the wedding she had always dreamed of.

After his proposal, Chris broached the idea of having a quick register office ceremony. But . it was not quite what she was hoping for, because for the six months . before Chris became ill Charlotte had been planning her dream of a rural . church wedding. Friends, family and local businesses rallied round to make the couple's magical wedding come true. Despite having a week's notice to be at the event, some 300 people shared the couple's big day at a neighbouring farm . She had compiled an online scrapbook . with her wedding wish-list, detailing everything she wanted from the . venue and who would be bridesmaids to the design of her wedding dress. Charlotte says, 'The whole day was just like the wedding I had dreamed of. We have been together for six years, and have always known we would get married, but had been taking our time. 'Even . though Chris hadn't asked me yet I would save links and pictures in a . folder on my tablet that I would want in my future wedding.

So good has the feedback been, Natalie and Fiona, from Porthcawl, South Wales, are hoping the NHS will start offering their 'Digni Bra' to women patients who want to cover their breasts. Natalie said: 'It's not about vanity, it is about dignity. Obviously all the medics are professionals who've seen it all. But we would still want to be covered up if we going in for surgery.' Until now, women have been given just a pair of paper pants before they going for operations - but with nothing to cover their breasts. But Natalie and Fiona have now designed a matching bra and pants made out of blue paper to be trialled for patients. Nurses Natalie Reid (left) and Fiona Cartwright (right) designed the garment which is now on trial at the Vale Healthcare Hospital in Cardiff, which specialises in cosmetic surgery including weight-loss procedures. The nurses discovered that many women dread surgery because they feel overly exposed. Until now women only wore paper knickers while undergoing surgery . The bra and pants are used once to cover a patient's modesty before being safely disposed. Natalie said: 'We have been working with female patients for a long time and we just thought: ""Why aren't women given bras?"" 'We did some research and they just don't exist. 'We thought that it was a great idea to develop - particularly with dignity being so high on the agenda in healthcare at the moment.' The royal blue bra protect patients' modesty while allowing for essential heart monitoring and can be easily removed for cardiac massage. The new garments protect patients' modesty while allowing for essential heart monitoring and can be easily removed for cardiac massage . The paper garments have been on trial at a private hospital in Cardiff and have been welcomed by both patients and the medical profession. Fiona said: 'When we did the survey we found that 95 per cent of the women we asked did not know that they may become exposed when being prepared for surgery. 'We have met with some of the health boards and they seemed very positive about the idea, but it's difficult at a time when the NHS is cutting back. Nurse Fiona said Digni Bra is a simple concept 'but it's part of the NHS' code of conduct to protect patients' dignity, so we are hopeful [it will be used more widely]' 'But it's part of their code of conduct to protect patients' dignity, so we are hopeful.' A survey of 100 female patients at the hospital found all but one would prefer to have had a bra provided. The bra is being trialled at the Vale Healthcare Hospital in Cardiff which specialises in cosmetic surgery including weight-loss procedures. Alison Moir, Clinic Manager at the the hospital said: 'A patient's dignity is at the forefront of our staff's behaviour and attitudes at all times.'","Natalie Reid and Fiona Cartwright from Porthcawl in South Wales discovered many women dread surgery because they feel so exposed .

Israel warned last night that the West should remain on its guard against Iran despite the surprise election of reformist-backed Hassan Rowhani as the country’s new president. Tens of thousands of chanting supporters filled the streets of Tehran following the landslide victory in joyous scenes a world apart from the violent crackdown on a thwarted people’s uprising four years ago. Cars honked and blared music ranging from patriotic songs to the Lambada after the triumphant cleric - who studied in Scotland in the 1970s and has a law doctorate from Glasgow Caledonian University - romped home with more than three times the votes of his nearest rival. Leaders: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (left) insisted there should be no 'wishful thinking' about reformist-backed Hassan Rowhani's (right) election as Iran's new president . But while Britain and the U.S. were cautiously urging Iran to follow through with a more moderate agenda, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted there should be no ‘wishful thinking’ about Mr Rowhani’s election. ‘Iran will be judged on its actions. If it insists on continuing to develop its nuclear programme the answer needs to be clear - stopping its nuclear programme by any means,’ he added. The newly-elected leader said yesterday that Iran’s dire economic problems can’t be solved ‘overnight.’ After winning over 50 per cent of the vote in Friday’s poll, he said his election was a ‘victory of moderation over extremism.’ One of his key election pledges was to restore relations with Western powers and seek to ease the crippling international sanctions imposed over its nuclear ambitions that have led to ballooning inflation at more than 30 per cent and 14 per cent unemployment. But in Iran, even landslides at the ballot box do not equate to policymaking influence. All key decisions - including nuclear . efforts, defence and foreign affairs - remain solidly in the hands of . Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, his ruling clerics and their . powerful protectors, the Revolutionary Guard. Happy: Supporters of the Iranian President elect Hasan Rowhani celebrate as he visits the shrine of the late revolutionary founder Ayatollah Khomeini, just outside Tehran, Iran, yesterday . Young fan: An Iranian girl flashes a victory sign, as she holds up a poster of Hassan Rowhani in Tehran . Although he won’t take power until August, Mr Rowhani took his first steps yesterday in consulting Iran’s clerically dominated establishment on his plans for the future. What Mr Rowhani’s victory does is reopen space for moderate and liberal voices that have been largely muzzled in reprisal for the massive protests and clashes in 2009 over claims the vote was rigged to deny reformists the presidency. 'Iran will be judged on its actions. If it insists on continuing to develop its nuclear programme the answer needs to be clear - stopping its nuclear programme by any means' Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli PM . The 64 year old is hardly a radical - having served in governments and in the highly sensitive role of nuclear negotiator - but he has taken a strong stance against the combative isolationist international policies of outgoing President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. ‘I thank God that once again rationality and moderation has shined on Iran,’ he said on state TV at the weekend. ‘This is the victory of wisdom, a victory of moderation and a victory of commitment over extremism.’ His emphasis on outreach could sharply lower the political temperature between Iran and the West - including Israel - and perhaps nudge the ruling establishment toward more flexible approaches in possible renewed nuclear talks with the U.S. and world powers. Mr Rowhani also has added leverage with . his political godfather and ally, former President Akbar Hashemi . Rafsanjani, who was blocked from the ballot but now can exert . significant influence from the wings. The White House congratulated Iranian . voters for ‘their courage in making their voices heard’ despite . clampdowns that included severe restrictions on the Internet, a key tool . of Iran’s opposition. Big victory: Supporters of Hassan Rowhani, shown in the poster, attend a celebration gathering in Tehran . All smiles: Hassan Rowhani waves to his supporters at the shrine of Iranian late supreme leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini . Washington urged Tehran’s leadership to ‘heed the will of the Iranian people and make responsible choices,’ while noting the US remained open for direct dialogue with Iran. Just a week ago, Mr Rowhani - the only cleric in the race - seemed greatly overshadowed by candidates with much deeper ties to the ruling theocracy and Revolutionary Guard. But he gained momentum: first with . endorsements from Mr Rafsanjani and another moderate-minded former . president Mohammad Khatami. 'I thank God that once again rationality and moderation has shined on Iran. This is the victory of wisdom, a victory of moderation and a victory of commitment over extremism' Hassan Rowhani . Then artists, activist and opposition leaders joined. In the span of a few days, Mr Rowhani was drawing huge crowds and the race - once seen as firmly in the control of the ruling system - was suddenly transformed. Alireza Nader, a senior policy analyst at the Rand Corp. who follows Iranian affairs, described Mr Rowhani as a de facto hero for reformists who couldn’t support any of the other five candidates on the ballot. ‘It remains to be seen how much room will be given to Rowhani by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the Revolutionary Guard,’ he cautioned. Iran’s new leader is said to be fluent in English, German, Russian, French and Arabic. He appears to be proud of his Scottish education, even mentioning it in a campaign video. He studied at the old Glasgow Polytechnic - now Glasgow Caledonian University - in the 1970s under his family name, Hassan Feridon, and returned in the 1990s to get his law doctorate.","Chanting supporters filled Tehran after Hassan Rowhani's landslide victory .

Jo Graham thought she had a harmless infection when she was admitted to hospital after complaining of an intense earache. But the 36-year-old failed to respond to treatment and was put in an induced coma at Coventry University Hospital last December. Jo Graham, 36, was admitted to Coventry University Hospital suffering from severe earache. She was told she could probably go home the next day but her condition deteriorated rapidly . Her husband Mark made the agonising decision to turn off her life support machine five days later when doctors said nothing more could be done to save her. The cause of death was only picked up in a post-mortem examination as hospital tests failed to reveal that she had meningitis. Mrs Graham was at a Christmas lights switch on in Kenilworth, Warwickshire, with her father, Roy, when she started to feel unwell. Her mother, Pat Collins, who was in hospital with pneumonia at the time, said: ‘She told Roy she wasn’t feeling very well and Roy took her to hospital in Coventry. The mother-of-three failed to respond to treatment and was put in an induced coma. Five days after she was admitted, doctors advised her family to turn off her life support machine . ‘Jo was given tablets and was told . she could probably go home the following day but she wasn't getting any . better and she stayed in hospital.’ Ms . Collins was unaware of her daughter's battle for life until a relative . came to deliver the devastating news that she wasn't 'expected to last . another day.' She was discharged so she could visit her daughter, who worked for Warwickshire Police, and was with her the day her life support machine was switched off. Her family, including her three children - Jade, 12, Callum, eight, and Kayla four, have spoken out to raise awareness of meningitis. A post mortem examination revealed that she had died of meningitis which did not show up on the tests carried out at Coventry University Hospital . Ms Collins paid tribute to her daughter and said: ‘Jo was bubbly, her children were her life and she loved her job, all that's been taken from her. ‘Part of us still can't believe that she's gone. We still keep expecting her to walk through the door.’ Mrs Graham's kidneys, liver, pancreas and lungs were donated after her death and her family have been told that has helped save the lives of four people. Meningitis is an inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. About 3,400 people contract bacterial meningitis and septicaemia in the UK each year - one in 10 people die while one in four are left with permanent disabilities. For more information on meningitis, call Meningitis UK on 0117 947 6320 or visit www.meningitisUK.org . Meningitis is an infection of the meninges - the protective membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord. The infection causes the meninges to become inflamed and can damage the nerves and brain. The most common symptoms include a high fever, severe headache, vomiting, a stiff neck, sensitivity to light, rapid breathing and a rash which does not disappear under pressure. There are two different types of meningitis - bacterial meningitis which is very serious and should be treated as a medical emergency, and viral meningitis which is more common and less serious. Meningitis can be hard to diagnose as it can come on very suddenly and is often mistaken for flu. Viral meningitis usually gets better within a couple of weeks but bacterial meningitis requires hospital admission for treatment with antibiotics.","Jo Graham, 36, was admitted to Coventry University Hospital with earache .

A combination of their visualisation techniques and the uniqueness of each shot they play contributes to their elephantine memories, said Dr Joel Fish. Each shot is filed away into the memory backs to be accessed for future reference when they are faced with a similar situation. Luke Donald tees off on the 16th tee during the fourth round of the US Open at Merion Golf Club. Each shot is unique and golfers can remember them in astonishing detail, maintains a sports psychologist . ‘Golfers can remember significantly more,' compared to athletes from other sports, Dr Fish, the director of the Centre for Sport Psychology in Philadelphia, told the New York Times. Golfers are helped to remember because each shot is unique, whether distance, approach, wind speed or slope. Moreover, they get a long time to consider how to play the shot, unlike most other sports people who have to make an instant decision. His claims were backed up by golfers such as Ernie Els, with two British and two US Open championships under his belt, who said: ‘The majors, I really remember my wins. I really remember almost every shot.’ Luke Donald said there are things outside golf that he struggles to remember but that it is completely different with the sport when ‘it doesn’t take me long to remember things’. Josh Teater, a golf pro since 2001, put it down to the length of time golfers get to consider what to do: ‘You’re living in the moment for a while, as opposed to shooting a basketball.’ Ernie Els (left) can remember every shot he made in his Open triumphs in Britain and the US. But Matt Kutchar (right) disputes the idea that a good memory helps golfers - he says he plays 'much more in the present than the past' But it’s not all advantageous, said Alan Goldberg, a sports psychologist from Amherst, Massachusettes. He maintains that it is best to rely on the unconscious memory – the hindbrain – to conscious thought – the forebrain – because of the risk of performance anxiety. ‘Think of them as two different-caliber golfers,” he said. “The hindbrain is a pro, excellent technique and timing. The front brain is a hacker. If you gave the front brain a golf club, it wouldn’t know what end to hold.’ Golfer Jerry Kelly said that under pressure golfers can quickly reveal their shortcomings: ‘You go through so many processes in your head, you forget about one key bit of information that could have saved a shot.' And Matt Kuchar, said his memory is far from perfect, which he regards as beneficial to his play: ‘I get up in a press conference after a round, and a guy asks me what I did on 15, and I can’t remember what 15 is. “I just try to play the shot in front of me. I’m much more in the present than the past.'","Golfers remember 'significantly more', says Dr Joel Fish .

Samuel L Jackson has urged men to be more open about their health problems in an attempt to tackle cancer. The Pulp Fiction star, who is fronting a new charity called One For The Boys, believes men should talk more about the disease and other illnesses. Jackson, 64, said: ‘Guys don't talk about their health issues, unless they've got a sprained ankle. Scroll down for video . Samuel L Jackson is fronting a campaign to encourage men to be more open about their health. He says he believes men need to be more aware of cancer and of their own bodies . For more videos, please go to ITV . ‘We'll talk about our injuries but we won't talk about our illnesses, so I think it's time we do that.’ The actor said he was motivated to put his weight behind the charity after he learnt that friends had secretly coped with cancer without telling anybody. He said: ‘When they started talking about it, I realised most guys don't talk to other guys about what their medical conditions are - especially cancer conditions. ‘And most guys think the only cancer guys get is prostate cancer, or they look at TV and see it as basically a woman's problem, but it's not. ‘So I realised that we do really need to make men aware of the fact that cancer is a very serious thing for guys.’ One For The Boys was founded by event organiser Sofia Davis to challenge men's understanding of cancers and their tendency to have a more laissez-faire approach to their health. In recent weeks, Angelia Jolie (left) has revealed that she had a double mastectomy to reduce her chance of developing breast cancer and Michael Douglas (right) spoke out about his battle with throat cancer . All money raised will go towards the Royal Marsden Hospital in London to buy new MRI scanners which will help with cancer diagnosis. In recent weeks, Angelina Jolie has revealed she had a double mastectomy because she has a higher chance of developing breast cancer, and Michael Douglas has spoken about his throat cancer. Asked what effect celebrities can have on people's perception of the disease, Jackson said: ‘We're just people who have interesting jobs, so people tend to look at us, or that fact that you guys [media] do shows, or you film us talking, allows people to hear our opinions about things, or sometimes, we'll just expose stuff about ourselves, and that makes people go, “Oh, that's sort of like us”. Samuel L Jackson says that he tries to keep fit and to eat healthily. He also says he uses alternative medicines and visits acupuncturists . ‘I don't know that what we say has more weight than anything else, but Angelina's declaration and allowing people to understand that she did that will maybe get some other women or some other person to look at their bodies and go in and go, “Ok, well maybe I do need to do this too, or I need to get checked”. ‘Hopefully we have enough credence, or our earnestness about the things we're talking about will make sense to people, or it reaches a greater number of people because we're the ones saying it. ‘I just want people to be aware and get out there and do something. To understand their bodies and understand the quality of life for them and their families if they understand what's going on, on the inside and the outside, because cancer is not just internal, it's external too.’ Jackson said he has an exercise and diet regime to make sure he keeps healthy. ‘I try and eat a certain way, and I try and exercise,’ he said. ‘I do use alternative medicines, I go to acupuncturists, get massages, but I'm old, so I need to have those things. ‘But the sooner you recognise how to take care of your body, the longer you'll have that engine driving you, and the more you'll be able to do for yourself and for other people because you are healthy and you'll be a healthy example.’ He added: ‘I stretch. I ride a bike. I don't necessarily get out and run. I ride a stationary bike for an hour, an hour and a half, two or three times a week. ‘I get on the big Swiss ball, I've got my TRX straps to use my own body weight to pull myself around. ‘Push-ups, pull-ups and stuff like that, so I try to find a way to maintain a specific weight and a specific level of fitness that allows me to have a comfortable lifestyle, and not be achy, and, I guess, kind of old.’","The Pulp Fiction star is fronting a new charity called One For The Boys .

The British people are weary of becoming involved in another lengthy conflict overseas . after more than a decade of fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, the . Defence Secretary said today. In what . will be considered a direct challenge to the Prime Minister and the Chancellor over any . possible military deployment to Syria, Phillip Hammond said Afghanistan . had become Britain’s Vietnam. The Defence Secretary's remarks came . while on a visit to the main British base at Camp Bastion in the Helmand . province of Afghanistan. Vietnam effect: Phillip Hammond has warned Afghanistan has become for the British what Vietnam was for America . His remarks also come amid heightened tensions over the . Middle East between the West and Russia, as the US prepares to arm rebel fighters after it . confirmed the Syrian regime had used chemical weapons on its own people. Mr Cameron has resisted greater . involvement in the Syrian conflict for the last two years partly over . fears of comparison with ex-PM Tony Blair, who took Britain into Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq two years later . The Prime Minister will use the G8 . Summit in Northern Ireland to talk to US President Barrack . Obama about how best to arm rebels in the country who have been trying . to topple the regime of Bashar al Assad for the past two years. Cuts row: Phillip Hammond has warned further cuts to the Ministry of Defence's budget will hurt Britain's operation effectiveness . He has already held preliminary . discussions by video conference with Mr Obama, the French President . Francois Hollande , German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Italian Prime . Minister Enrico Letta, a Downing Street spokesman confirmed this . morning. ‘Three days before a working dinner on . foreign policy, they discussed the situation in Syria and how G8 . countries should all agree to work on together a political transition to . end the conflict,’ Downing Street said. Britain has been engaged in almost continuous conflict in the Middle Eat since the 9/11 attacks on the US in 2001. Since then, 444 British Service personnel have died in the Afghanistan and thousands more have been seriously injured. 'I suspect that the British people - and . not just the British people - will be wary of enduring engagements on . this kind of scale for perhaps quite a long while in the future,' Mr . Hammond said in an interview with The Daily Telegraph. 'You might call it the Vietnam . phenomenon - when an engagement turns out to be longer and more costly . than originally envisaged, there is often a public reaction to that.' Mr Hammond added the true lesson from . Afghanistan may be that a prolonged military commitment could have been . avoided if the West had been prepared to intervene earlier before al . Qaida launched its attack on the Twin Towers. 'We ourselves have learned the lesson . that earlier, smaller scale intervention may often avoid the need for . more massive intervention later, and if we are in a mood for beating . ourselves up, perhaps we should have foreseen the consequences of what . was happening in Afghanistan before 9/11,' he said. 'Perhaps we should have been more . forward leaning in the West collectively in intervening to try and head . off what was happening here before it happened.' Combat fatigue: the Defence Secretary warned this weekend that the British people had become weary of the UK's involvement in overseas operations . On patrol: British soldiers have been involved in active operations in Afghanistan for 12 years . Earlier this week Mr Cameron raised the prospect of weapons falling into terrorist hands. ‘Elements affiliated to al-Qaeda in the . region have attempted to acquire chemical weapons for probable use in . Syria,’ the Prime Minister said. Britain is currently providing . ‘non-lethal’ equipment to the Syrian rebels but Foreign Secretary . William Hague has, with the support of France, been working had to lift a . European Union arms embargo. US confirmation of British and French . reports that the Syrian army was using chemical weapons against the . rebels has increased the prospect of weapons being passed to the rebels. Mr Hague said earlier this week the West 'must do more’ to put pressure on the . Assad regime to reach a peaceful settlement with the rebels and stop the . bloodshed which the UN says has so far cost in excess of 93,000 lives. The Defence Secretary’s comments also . come at a time when he is being asked to make even more cuts to his . department as part of the Chancellor’s comprehensive spending review. His is one of the few departments yet to have agree cuts at part of the . review. Last month Mr Hammond publicly warned any further cuts to his . department would come at a cost to Britain’s military capability.
