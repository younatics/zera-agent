"By . Lizzie Parry . Herbert Chandler died in January after doctors at the William Harvey Hospital in Ashford inserted a chest drain into the wrong lung, causing it to collapse . A 'series of failings' at a Kent hospital led to the death of a great-grandfather after doctors operated on the wrong lung. Herbert Chandler, 85, was rushed to hospital with several chronic diseases and a collapsed left lung. Doctors took him into theatre for a procedure to help his breathing - but in a fatal error, the surgeon operated on his right one. The great-grandfather-of-four, who had been admitted five days earlier to William Harvey Hospital in Ashford, Kent, died just three hours after the operation. Coroner Rachel Redman, concluding the inquest in Folkestone, Kent, said a number of 'failings' by the hospital led to Mr Chandler's death. Ms Redman said: 'Mr Chandler suffered from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and a left pneumothorax [air that is trapped next to a lung]. 'A series of failings by the Trust have caused or contributed to the cause of death.' She added that an 'erroneous aspiration' - the drainage of air or fluid - in the right chest cavity caused his death after a number of 'systematic errors'. The registrar, Dr Charlotte Tai carried out a procedure on Mr Chandler, called an aspiration, on the evening of January 22. This is when air between the chest wall and lung, which causes the collapse, is removed using a needle and syringe. But the inquest heard she had been given an inaccurate medical note written by another doctor which said the right lung needed treatment  - when it was the left. When she discovered she had treated the wrong lung she carried out an aspiration on the right one. But both lungs had by then collapsed and Mr Chandler, from Rolvenden, Kent, died about three hours after the treatment. The inquest heard there were a number of blunders made before the procedure, including failing to give Mr Chandler a chest drain. In her conclusion, Ms Redman found Dr Tai failed to request an X-ray before carrying out the procedure, despite the most recent scan being more than two days old. The inquest heard the William Harvey Hospital in Ashford, Kent apologised to Mr Chander's family and has implemented a raft of changes to ensure similar mistakes are not made in the future . The same doctor also failed to check . the existing radiology immediately before the procedure and did not . examine Mr Chandler to check her findings matched the data. The . coroner branded the hospital 'conservative' for treating his . condition with antibiotics, nebulisers and steroids and found he . had been inappropriately prescribed other medication. Furthermore, it failed to provide an on-call respiratory consultant and . kept medical records in a 'confusing format', the coroner said. In . a statement, Mr Chandler's heartbroken sons Colin and Alan said their father, who ran a nursery all his life with his brothers, . should not have 'been left to suffer'. Mr Chandler's sons Alan and Colin said: ''Our father is missed by many friends, family, grandchildren and great grandchildren' They said: 'We have yet to see any proof that systems have been improved within the Trust since his death. 'We do now believe that the treatment . provided to our father was unsatisfactory. He should not have been left . to suffer for more than five days before any action was taken to ease . his suffering. 'If earlier . action had been taken then perhaps this ""out of hours"" procedure would . not have taken place at all - or may not have resulted in a fatal . consequence. 'We have made . it clear to Doctor Tai, and have told her so personally, that we hold no . ill feelings towards her and hope that she will continue with a . successful medical career. 'We . feel that she is another victim here, let down by some of her medical . colleagues and the lack of systems put in place by management. 'Our . father is missed by many friends, family, grandchildren and great . grandchildren. We do not want his premature death to be in vain.' Mr . Chandler was the widower of Alma Chandler, with whom he was married to . for almost 60 years. He is survived by two sons, three grandchildren . and four great grandchildren. Dr Tai still works for East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust. But Dr Athanasios Nakos, who was supposed to fit the chest drain, does not. A trust spokesman said: 'We would like to express our sincere sympathy to his family and apologise for the errors in his care. 'The . trust has taken this incident extremely seriously and, following a . detailed investigation, has put in place a series of steps to attempt to . reduce the risk of these events from occurring again.' He . added they are carefully considering the concerns of the coroner and . new protocol and checklists for all procedures on patient's lungs has . also been put in place.","Herbert Chander died in January at the William Harvey Hospital in Kent .

"By . Lizzie Parry . A baby who was beating a cancer-like illness, died unexpectedly and suddenly after contracting a deadly infection. When he was just five months old Max Moment was diagnosed with Langerhans Cell . Histiocytosis - a rare blood cell disease which affects around 50 children a . year and leads to painful sores all over the body. It began as a red dotted . rash and he was referred to a dermatologist. The condition had affected his liver and spleen. Rare disease: Max Moment had Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis which affects around 50 children a year . After . 11 months of chemotherapy, Max went into remission . and his mother Mikayla MacMillan, 27, began to plan their future together. Around the same time he contracted chickenpox after his elder sister Olivia, five, picked it up but Max was said to have been treated appropriately and treatment was successful. Tragedy then struck just two weeks later after he was seen by doctors at Manchester Children Hospital for chemotherapy. The . following day he appeared floppy and unwell and Miss MacMillan dialled 999. He was rushed to Royal Blackburn Hospital by . ambulance and was said to have been suffering from fever in keeping with . septic shock. He underwent . treatment during resuscitation and was stabilised on a ventilator . before his condition deteriorated - he died on April 15. Dr Vanessa Holme told the inquest that Max underwent treatment during resuscitation and was stabilised on a ventilator before his condition deteriorated. Giving her opinion on his death she said: 'My opinion is that Max succumbed to an overwhelming infection.' After 11 months of chemotherapy, Max went into remission and his mother Mikayla MacMillan, pictured, began to plan their future together . After an inquest into Max’s death Mrs MacMillan, of Clitheroe, Lancashire, said: 'What happened to Max was the cruellest blow as he appeared better and happier than he had ever been in his whole life. 'He had been absolutely fine the day before his death and had gone to sleep with a smile on his face. 'A couple of days before that he had started to learn to crawl and we were planning holidays because before that we couldn’t take anything for granted. I wasn’t even able to cuddle him. 'Life was getting back to normal and we were able to play with him and we could take him out - not to the park because it was a bit too risky - but we went to the shops. 'The disease had more or less gone and we thought it was the end of it. 'It was the light at the end of the tunnel. He always had a good prognosis. Everything was always really positive and he was always really positive. 'What happened to him seems so cruel especially when he seemed to be so much better.' Heart-breaking: Max was beating the rare disease when he caught chicken pox, which led to a fatal infection . As soon as Max was diagnosed doctors put him on chemotherapy, which was intensified at Christmas . Tests could not prove if Max had a viral infection or if was linked to his chicken pox but he had a lower than usual immune system. Speaking outside the inquest Mrs MacMillan said: 'As soon as Max got the diagnosis in April 2013, the doctors put him on low dose chemotherapy until Christmas when they changed it to intense for three months. 'He was on chemotherapy all over Christmas and at one stage was really poorly and lost his hair.' 'He never got to go to a park because of the risk of infection and germs, even if one of the family had a cold we had to keep them away. We may as have well have put a cross on the door - he was that susceptible. A cold could wipe him out. 'He was in pain and it was heart-wrenching that you couldn’t cuddle him because that’s all you wanted to do. 'When he started the chemo his skin got better and you could give him cuddles almost straight away. Max's mother Mikayla was unable to cuddle him due to painful sores which blistered and covered tiny body . 'But you would not believe what he went through and I don’t know of many grown-ups who have been through as much as he had been through in 17 months. 'My Max was always smiling. There’s pictures of him in hospital with oxygen up his body and tubes and attached to a blood transfusion and laughing. He had 63 blood transfusions. 'The nurses used to laugh because instead of having a toy in his hand he would have a plastic syringe. 'That morning I didn’t realise how . ill he was because death had never been an option for Max. I phoned 999 . and they said they had to put sirens on and in my heart of hearts I . knew. 'His body had gone . into shock. This was Tuesday morning. He had chemotherapy at Manchester . on the Monday and he was laughing with doctors and it was normal and . then the following day he was ill and died.' Always smiling: Max's mother devastated Mikayla said her son was an inspiration during his short life . 'We’re just so devastated. Whatever life threw at him, Max seemed to fight on and was an inspiration. 'He was a very happy child who always had a smile on his face. We explained to Olivia that he had gone to heaven and he was poorly. 'She writes letters to him in heaven and posted them to him and has a memory box of him so she can look at him whenever she wants.' Recording a narrative conclusion, the coroner Mr Michael Singleton said that Max had 'succumbed to an overwhelming infection' and because of his ongoing maintenance chemotherapy his immune system had been low. He said he still may have died even if he wasn’t on chemotherapy. Mr Singleton told Mrs MacMillan: 'I know there are no words I can express that will take away any of the pain. 'I can’t begin to imagine what that must be like, I know coming here must not have been easy.'","17-month old Max Moment was diagnosed with Langerhans Cell .

"By . Rebecca Hardy . Gabby Logan will be the only female member of the BBC's presenting team at the World Cup . Gabby Logan wants to hold her tongue about sexism in football today. Really she does. Which is just as well given she's outnumbered, at a rough count, by about 100 to one. We're here in the Royal Institute of British Architects' swanky London HQ to meet the team the BBC will be sending to cover the World Cup in Brazil in less than a fortnight's time. The 'we' is largely a throng of sports hacks, while Team BBC includes, among others, Gary Lineker, Rio Ferdinand, Alan Shearer, Chris Waddle, Robbie Savage and, er... Gabby. She's the one in the little ra-ra skirt and T-shirt style top, looking rather like the cheerleader. Now, this is the same Gabby who said of the last World Cup, 'I've experienced sexism in my career - comments and situations that are specific to me being a woman. It was quite apparent during the World Cup in South Africa. I was staying in quite an isolated place in a high-testosterone environment. I just wanted to go back to my hotel and read a magazine.' Fast-forward four years and Gabby says, 'Now you can look at this room and think, ""Yeah, I see what she means.""' See it? You'd better believe it, these are some very blokey blokes. Gabby shrugs. 'That's the way it is. There isn't lots of room for women. No gaps have been created,' she says. 'The same people are doing the job so you're not going to move somebody on just for the sake of it. Do you know what I mean?' Not really. This is, after all, the BBC - that great champion of equal opportunities and diversity. Surely they could have rooted out one or two other women with a grasp of the beautiful game to even up the odds from 13 (the number of blokes on parade for Team BBC) to one (Gabby)? 'With the pundits, you're talking about men who play football, so it's a man's world there,' she says. Well, it certainly is here. You could bottle the testosterone. But what about the 29 million women playing football worldwide or, for that matter, those competing in the Women's World Cup in Canada next year? I suspect England captain Casey Stoney might beg to differ with Gabby. 'I guess while Gary Lineker's still a presenter, how is a woman ever supposed to come in?' Gabby is not threatened by her male comrades and is often found teasing them - once describing Gary Lineker as a 'crisp salesman' She sounds a little restrained, rather than outspoken. God forbid she's been told to button it. Not our Gabby. She is, after all, at 41 still a trailblazer for women in sports broadcasting who, along with the wonderful Clare Balding, helped bring the Olympic Games alive. We like her forthright views. We like her sharp tongue. We like her wit. Remember her recent hilarious talk at Leeds Trinity University when she teased Lineker about becoming 'a crisp salesman', joked about Ryan Giggs' affair with his sister-in-law and said Andy Murray was the 'moodiest, most miserable b****** I've ever met in my life' after he lost the mixed doubles final at the Olympics? I last saw Gabby a few months after that spectacular London 2012. She was reeling from her post-sports-extravaganza high, saying, 'I even found it difficult to get excited about football. Everything felt a bit anti-climactic.' Now she says, 'I think a lot of people felt that deflation. It was such an amazing thing to have been a part of. Everyone got so excited about it. Afterwards, it's hard to go back to regular work. It doesn't seem as exciting, but life moves on. The memories start to disappear a bit.' Gabby had the honour of presenting the 2012 Olympic Games . When Gabby worked on the Olympics the games dominated the Logan household, with her twins Reuben and Lois, now eight, attending many of the events. She'll be leaving them at home with her husband, former Scottish rugby international Kenny Logan, when she travels to Brazil. Given that her role on Team BBC will be to follow England, whose odds of winning the tournament are up there with the ratio of blokes to girls in this room, she might not be away for too long. Gabby adores her children, who were conceived with IVF. Gabby with her husband Kenny Logan in 2012 . 'When I was at the World Cup in South Africa they came out for a few days,' she says. 'But I felt a bit bad for the other guys who were missing their kids. At that point I thought, ""I shouldn't have done this."" You're there to work. 'But I think it's hard for anyone when they're away from the family. You miss your kids. You miss your husband. I'm sure there are a lot of times I'll think, ""Oh, I'm missing sports day today."" It's normal. You do the job to the best of your ability but you can't help but miss your family. But it's a job. You just have to keep all the balls in the air.' Gabby is some juggler. Since the 2012 games she's been keeping several balls in the air. Last year, as well as hosting the World Aquatics Championships and covering the Athletics World . Championships from Moscow, she replaced Sue Barker on BBC Sports Personality of the Year. She's also dipped her toe into primetime TV, hosting BBC1's comedy panel series I Love My Country and presenting ITV1's Splash! alongside Vernon Kay (the first series was a ratings winner, the second made more of a plop than a splash with two million fewer viewers). Will she be returning with a third series? 'I don't know yet,' she says. 'Entertainment TV is really very...' She plasters on a smile. 'Hopefully it will, because I did really enjoy it.' Gabby was brought up on football. Her father, Terry Yorath, was the former Welsh international footballer and manager whose life fell to pieces along with the rest of the family's when Gabby's brother Daniel, who was signed for Leeds United, dropped dead in the garden while kicking a ball in 1992. He was only 15 and suffering from an un-detected heart condition. Gabby now has a fear of everything falling to pieces when the going gets good. In fact, eyebrows were raised recently when it was revealed she had invested in the same tax-avoidance scheme as Gary Barlow, but she moved swiftly to point out that like many others she'd been misled, and that since 2012 she's been working with the Inland Revenue to repay any money owed. Gabby on the set of Splash! with co-hosts, Tom Daley and Vernon Kaye, she says she hope that a third series will kick off soon . She says she tends to ringfence her fears by pushing herself on and on. 'This summer we've got the World Cup, the Commonwealth Games and then the European Athletics Championships so it's going to be a fantastic - though busy - work period. Then in two years we're back in Brazil for the Olympics.' Has she been confirmed as part of Team BBC? 'Yes,' she says. 'Look, when I was saying that as a woman in a man's environment when you've been on the road for three weeks with blokes all the time, you kind of think, ""Oh I wouldn't mind a coffee with a girl today,"" it's not because they're behaving badly. They're just being themselves and being men. 'I'm kind of bored talking about it. I'm busy doing my job. You never know if this is going to be the last time they ask you, do you? Or when your time's up. I never take any of this for granted.' And, with a swish of that flirty little ra-ra skirt, she's up and off, pushing her way through all that testosterone.","Gabby is heading off to Brazil this summer for the World Cup .

"By . Rebecca Hardy . Lisa Faulkner is a sensitive soul. When the sun's shining she's happy as a dog with two tails, but when it's raining... well, let's just say, the world is not her favourite place. 'I suppose my life is dictated by my moods,' she says. 'When it's raining and it's a Sunday and it's horrible, there's that feeling of, ""Oh God"". I'm not good at pulling myself out of it. I have to wallow in it so I hide in my kitchen and cook. If I feel something, I feel it 100 per cent. If I feel sad, I feel really sad. If I'm happy I bounce about.' Thankfully, actress-turned-cookery expert Lisa, 41, is in a bouncy mood when we meet. I guess her 'really new, really lovely' relationship with BBC1's MasterChef judge John Torode has something to do with it. They've been seeing one another since last October, two-and-a-half years after Lisa won the 2010 series of Celebrity Master-Chef and began working in John's posh London restaurant Smiths of Smithfield (which he's since sold). Happier now: Lisa has come through IVF and a failed relationship . 'When I met John he was a judge on a show I loved and I was petrified of him. He was brilliant and gave us all tips so you didn't want to let him down. All I could think was, “That sauce hasn't worked.” I didn't see anything but food for three months. After I won, we did The Good Food Show and stuff. John and I always got on, but I never thought about me and him.' Quite rightly too, for they were both married with young children. John, 48, separated from Jessica, his wife of four years and the mother of his eight-year-old son and six-year-old daughter, at the end of 2011. Lisa's marriage to actor Chris Coghill, with whom she has an adopted daughter Billie, seven, ended in April last year. Which leads me to the tricky bit... Look Lisa, you're a lovely girl (she is) and a joy to meet (ditto), but we know how steamed up kitchens can be. Are you honestly saying this really-new-really-lovely relationship wasn't simmering away before your respective marriages ended? 'Absolutely not,' she says. 'It never crossed my mind. John and I were friends. Neither of us thought of it as anything else until...' Until? 'I don't know how things change, but something does. He asked me on a date. We went out for dinner. Then it was slightly different.' Slightly? 'I'm really, really happy. John and I are having such a nice time but we're taking things slowly. There are lots of other people to consider.' Including her daughter Billie? She nods. 'John and I were friends. Neither of us thought of it as anything else until...' Billie was 15 months old when she was adopted after Lisa had endured three failed IVF attempts. 'The other day Billie was bouncing on the trampoline with a friend and I heard the friend say something about, “When you were born was your mummy really big?” Billie said, “My Tummy Mummy had me. My mummy adopted me so she's my Forever Mummy. I didn't grow in her tummy. I grew in her heart.”' Lisa has tears in her eyes as she tells me this. 'Both Chris and I really wanted to be parents. Going for adoption is very, very tough, but I didn't want to get to 40-something thinking, “I've spent everything on IVF. I can't do anything else and I'm past the time I can adopt.” I thought, “I want to be a mother and, whatever it takes, I will be a mother.” 'Chris was completely on the same page from day one. There are a lot of reasons you separate. It's rarely just one thing. I suppose the IVF was a huge strain. You go crazy. There are so many drugs flying around your body and you're on this mission to get pregnant. You spend so much money. It's fraught. You're injecting yourself in the loos and you've got bruises all over you. Mentally there's all those highs and then loss. It's heartbreaking. Most people have a child at the end of it, so think, “I've got this, which makes it worth it.” For a long time I didn't have anything to make it better. Nothing.' She sighs. 'After adopting I was at home for a year. It was very strange going back into that world of telly.' Lisa began acting at 19 in the film The Lover after leaving school at 16 to model. Roles in Brookside, Holby City and Spooks followed. 'For a year you're defined by talking about babies then you go back into the real world and think, “Who am I? I don't know who I am.” 'We worked very hard to make our marriage work and it didn't. But we have a friendship that works with Billie and that's everything to us. It's not her fault we couldn't make it work. My daughter is my number one priority.' New romance: Lisa Faulkner with John Torode . We're here because Lisa has written her second recipe book, The Way I Cook…, which features Billie throughout. 'Cooking anchors me and calms me,' she says. 'Whenever life throws its curve balls I gravitate towards the kitchen, but I never knew I was any good at cooking. When I won MasterChef, I found I was good at something I loved. Cooking for me is about moods. I find I want to cook different things at different times.' The Way I Cook… includes recipes for 'when the sun is shining', 'on a rainy day', 'for family and friends' and features a recipe for John Torode's Thai Green Curry. 'The food thing is a massive connection with John. To be able to talk about food, to love it, to be able to go out and eat and ask questions is amazing.' Her love of food comes from her mother Julie, who died of throat cancer when Lisa was just 16. She was a talented amateur cook who inspired Lisa's first best-selling cookbook Recipes From My Mother For My Daughter, published last year. 'Last year was difficult. Things were not happy and I had this thing about being 40' 'Mummy was ill for nearly two years and for a long time I was very angry about it. I was 15, 16. Suddenly I'd discovered boys. I was at a girl's school. I just wanted to go and have fun like all teenagers do. Now I think, “Why was I so awful?” But of course you don't think somebody's going to die when you're a teenager. 'I'm very like my mother in that she was an open book. You'd know the minute she came in and the door slammed she was in a bad mood. When she was fine, she'd close the door gently, say “Hi guys” and it was like the sun had come out. When she died it left me with a lot of guilt. I thought I was the worst daughter in the land.' Actress turned property expert: Lisa was crowned Celebrity MasterChef 2010 . It's the first time she's talked about her mother with such honesty. I suspect her happy relationship with John has a lot to do with it. He lost his mum when he was four. 'I was talking to somebody the other day and they said, “Once you can cope with losing your mum you can cope with anything.” I'll never, ever go through a day like the day she died again. It was the worst day ever. 'I remember saying goodbye to her to go to school. She was asleep and she squeezed my hand, but I didn't go to school. I bunked off. I was with my boyfriend and my poor father was driving around trying to find me. When I went home my grandparents were there and my grandad told me. I went upstairs to see her.' Lisa is in tears. 'It's funny how something will always, always affect you. 'Last year was difficult. Things were not happy and I had this thing about being 40. Mum died when she was 44 so in my head I was thinking, “When did it first start happening? Could this be my last happy year? Maybe I've got three happy years left.” Now I want to get past 44. For a long time I didn't see myself doing that. My dad said, “You're crazy.” I'd say, “But I can't see past it.” But now I can. 'I do live by my moods, but the sun does come out eventually. For now I'm having a really happy time and it's lovely not to be dreading autumn for the first time in years - really lovely.' Lisa's second book, The Way I Cook..., is out Thursday (Simon & Schuster, £20).","Actress appeared on Celebrity Masterchef in 2010 .

"By . Rebecca Hardy . There's nothing Matthew Jukes hates more than a dull wine. Actually, there's also 'nipping' (more of which later), supermarket wine buyers  and an untidy sock drawer. Award-winning wine writer Matthew is a meticulous man who likes everything in its place – which, for 97 per cent of wines currently on sale in Britain, he says, is down the plughole. 'A lot of wine is boring as sin,' he says. 'I only write up three per cent of the wines I taste, the rest are awful. If you can't inject personality or passion into a bottle of wine, why are you doing it? I tasted more than 4,000 bottles to find 200 for my wine collection.' Matthew has tasted more than 4,000 bottles of wine for his collection of 200 . He's referring to his 200 finest-value wines in the UK today, which we're giving away as a guide in Weekend Magazine this week and next. 'I had to kiss a lot of frogs to find the right bottles,' he says. 'Waitrose and Sainsbury's wines are pretty good this year, but Asda is shocking. Supermarket buyers are now bean counters. They're not talented palates. It's all about making money. It's not about finding an incredible wine and launching it onto the market. That's all gone.' Surely he's not referring to those half-price gems we pile into our trolleys? 'That's nonsense,' he says. 'The price it's reduced to is one they're still making the right margin at. So, invariably, it's an inflated price beforehand. It's naughty.' He shakes his head in despair. Matthew, 46, is passionate about wine - good wine enjoyed with food, not the cheap 'boring stuff' you stick in the fridge door and 'nip away at' to unwind. He's referring to the trend among middle-class women of so-called oblivion-drinking to blot out stress. 'By the time the husband comes home from work, you've had a bottle. I think it's pretty desperate. My mantra is that wine tastes better with food and food tastes better with wine. Don't nip away at a bottle when you're just pottering – and I never, ever drink on my own.' Matthew tastes 40,000 bottles of wine a year . Hang on Matthew, you're paid to taste 40,000 bottles of wine a year, surely you get unsteady on your feet at the end of a heavy day? 'God no,' he says with such horror I might as well have suggested we share a bottle of Blue Nun. 'I don't drink them all. I spit them out at work. Outside of work we have dinner parties, cook and taste lots of different bottles. It's about flavours. You often pour away what's left if you've not finished the glass, to taste the next one. It's a bit nerdy, but fun and...' And he's off, enthusing about the wonders of the sort of wine you don't stick in the fridge and nip. But the thing about Matthew is he makes it so understandable to those of us who don't know our sancerre from our sauvignon blanc. Which is how he's made his name as one of the most influential voices in the wine world. 'I have a big mouth and lots of energy,' he says. 'I don't believe there's such a thing as a natural palate. I could teach you to be a great taster. It's about practice and memory. 'I use a lot of imagery. For example, a gorgeous woman would be a sauvignon blanc from the Loire Valley. The sun doesn't beat down as hard there as it does in Chile or New Zealand. It's going to give you a tang on the palate and a nice smell like the perfume of a girl who wanders up and gives you a “wow”. It's about the shape, the curves, the length, the beauty and the finesse of the wine.' What about a bunny boiler? 'Grapes from the Rhone Valley further south in France. They enjoy getting ripe and full of sugar and you can ferment them up to 15 per cent alcohol so you've got a white wine that has the alcohol of a butch red wine. They rush up to you and you haven't got any control over how it hits you. The memory is hazy – “Did I like it? I'm not sure” – and the hangover is dreadful.' 'I use a lot of imagery. For example, a gorgeous woman would be a sauvignon blanc from the Loire Valley' Crikey, he seems to know as much about women as wine. Matthew, who has two daughters from an earlier marriage, adores his wife Amelia. If she were a wine, he says, she'd be a Chambolle-Musigny Premier Cru Les Amoureuses, Roumier, Burgundy, because 'of the heavenly flavour of the pinot noir, the romantic vineyard name and the fact I bought a bottle of it to drink the day after we got married'. They married four years ago after meeting at a wine tasting. Amelia was 'a bit of a nipper but I've persuaded her over to my side'. He's had less joy organising her sock drawer. Matthew, as I've said, likes everything in its place. During the hour-and-a-half we've been talking he's lined up all the cutlery on the table like soldiers on parade. 'Amelia gets infuriated by it. I'm super-tidy – OCD. I can't work until the house is perfect.' It must be perfect all the time then, as he's a prodigious worker who's published 14 books. Matthew's passion for wine began at the age of eight when his family were living in Belgium. His father was the European head of the huge multinational ITT Corporation and his mother a brilliant cook who entertained regularly at home. Matthew chucked in his degree to work in a wine shop in Barnes and by 22 he'd been hired as wine buyer for Chelsea's Bibendum restaurant . 'We had an entrance hall with a staircase that went round in a circle and a balcony at the top. I'd be there in my dressing gown, pyjamas and little slippers watching these top people come in. I'd say hello and then pour the wine. I remember being given a taste and reading the labels. I was fascinated with labels because I figured out that was the birth certificate of the wine. I'd look up the vineyards in an atlas and see the villages where these wines came from.' At ten he went to the Oratory School in Berkshire where he discovered rugby, beer and girls, but his passion for wine persisted. 'I had a fridge in my room with wine in it and always entertained  - particularly girls.' After school he began to  study physics at Queen Mary's in London, where a master noted he was 'not much of a physicist, quite a good rugby player and a hell of a wine snob'. He chucked in his degree to work in a wine shop in Barnes and by 22 he'd been hired as wine buyer for Chelsea's Bibendum restaurant. The next year it won Best Restaurant Wine List in the country. He remains as enthusiastic today. 'Wine is an ever-changing subject. Every 12 months, every wine made is in a bottle and trundling off into the world, and new versions are being made. It never stops.'Neither, it seems, does Matthew.","Matthew Jukes has been in the wine industry since his early twenties .

"By . Rebecca Hardy . Former Bond girl Fiona Fullerton is, well let’s say, very shaken and more than a bit stirred. ‘I don’t like being called a vandal. That man is completely out of order. I’m going to go for him. How dare he make sweeping statements about acts of vandalism? That’s defamation of character. ‘More than an apology I’d like some compensation. He’s going to realise you don’t mess with Fiona. I don’t care who he is.’ ‘That man’ is, actually, Peter Swales, chairman of the very proper Cheltenham Bridge Club. And the ‘act of vandalism’? Local dispute: Fiona Fullerton argues that she had permission to remove the trees from outside her home and claims she is being targeted by locals who want her to leave the area . The local newspaper ran a story on Mr Swales complaining about Fiona cutting down two towering ‘cypress trees’ near the Georgian property she’s renovating in one of the spa town’s leafier (albeit less leafy now) streets. ‘Felling these trees basically amounts to vandalism,’ said a hot-under-the-tweed-collar Mr Swales. ‘It’s just property developers making cash without a care for the community’. Hear, hear, echoed Sarah Knightly-Brown who’s lived in the neighbourhood for 30 years and signed a petition to keep the trees. ‘The greenery of this area is what makes it so special. These trees are iconic and have been there since I moved in.’ But as Fiona furiously points out, these are not cypress trees or anything else worthy of a tree preservation order. They were, in fact, cypress leylandii. You know, those huge, ugly weeds of trees that neighbours fall out over NOT being chopped down. Hence, the council’s delight when Fiona and her husband, property developer Neil Shackell, applied for permission to remove them. She remembers the incident that fired the opening shot, a few weeks ago: ‘This lady who’s got a double barrelled name — Sarah something-something — came up to my husband outside the house and started barking at him. When Neil said we had planning permission to take the trees down, she said, ‘oh, they’re iconic trees.’ ‘I’ve never heard of leylandii being called iconic trees, and, as Neil said: ''It must be the first time anyone’s got a petition up to save a leylandii. But it’s this gentleman, the chairman of the bridge club Peter Swales, who has been the most vocal about this 'absolute act of vandalism' —felling these trees.' ‘Several members of the club seemed to think they were yew trees because another rather rotund, florid, bridge-complexioned gentleman said to my husband, 'I gather you’re cutting down this yew tree'. ‘Neil said, 'it’s not a yew tree. It’s a cypress leylandii'. He said, 'as far as we’re concerned it’s a yew” and walked off'.' Anger: Neighbours accused Fiona Fullerton of 'vandalism' when she removed trees from outside her home in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire (pictured) This is a script worthy of Hyacinth Bucket from the sitcom Keeping Up Appearances. I suggest perhaps it would be best to put this whole spat down to a little misunderstanding between neighbours and invite them round for a sherry? Not, it seems, when you’re don’t-mess-with-me Fiona, armed with a licence to fell. ‘When you move into any area, you want to have good relations with your neighbours. But this man called me a vandal. We had planning permission to take those trees down, but his misinformed allegation is now on the internet for anyone to read. ‘I bumped into Mrs Brown [Sarah Knightly-Brown] on the train the other day. ‘She was apologising and tried to sit down. I said, 'please don’t sit down. Could you remain standing?' She looked at me and said, 'I had no idea the story would be so big. Do you think it’s because you’re famous?' I felt like saying, 'I know you’re aristocratic but do you really have no brain? What did you think would happen when you went to the papers and said the house was mine?' I suspect this goes to the heart of the matter. The Bridge Club is largely made up of... well, think retired army officers, twin-sets, pearls and lots of tweed, who are increasingly having their noses put out of joint by the ‘Down From Londoners’ (DFLs) breezing into this delightful regency town with their metropolitan ways and hiking house prices to exorbitantly high levels. Fiona’s Grade II listed home cost an eye-watering £950,000 when she bought it this year. She expects to spend £500,000 more on the 4,500 sq ft property, which is being totally gutted (under the watchful eye of the conservation folk at Cheltenham Borough Council). Glamour: Fiona Fullerton's naturalness is what drew so many of us to her on BBC1's Strictly Come Dancing last year where she dances alongside Anton Du Beke . The actress, who played a KGB spy in the 1985 film A View to A Kill with Roger Moore and recently wowed us with her quickstep on BBC1’s Strictly Come Dancing, has thrown herself into community life, volunteering for Cheltenham Arts Festival. ‘When we moved here [she, Neil and their 18-year-old daughter are in a rented house until the renovation is complete] I asked the organisers if there was anything I could do. ‘I said, 'I want to be behind the scenes - one of the movers and shakers.' They bit my arm off.’ Fiona and Neil first swapped suburbia for country life in 1999 when Lucy was three and James - Neil’s son whose mum died when he was two - was nine, and moved to a village near Swindon. ‘We had a river, a swimming pool, a tennis court and a huge house and I was truly happy for the first time in my life.’ As Fiona began to blossom in her sprawling former vicarage by the River Thames, she set up a successful buy-to-let business and began a newspaper property column. ‘When we first moved down there was a bit of scepticism. I remember dropping Lucy off at school before going to a meeting in London so I had a nice outfit on. One of the mums turned to me and said, 'Oh, that’s what a yummy mummy looks like.' ’ She continues to look pretty yummy with her endless legs and strong jawline. Fiona’s had no Botox, no fillers and doesn’t bother with the gym. Her naturalness is what drew so many of us to her on BBC1’s Strictly Come Dancing last year where she, she says, ‘played the role of the aging glamourpuss’. Star: Fiona Fullerton says she 'played the role of the aging glamourpuss' on Strictly Come Dancing . ‘Lucy and I used to watch it. I couldn’t believe it when they asked me to do it after years below the parapet. It was strange to be back in the limelight again, but it was Lucy who persuaded me to do it. ‘Strictly was a wonderful step for re-establishing my own confidence. You arrive in the make-up department with no make-up and straggly hair only to emerge two hours later with this amazing face with eyelashes and about five people’s hair on your head. Those make-up girls make you feel really special. ‘A lot of the younger women on Strictly had already had stuff done. ‘Ageing isn’t easy. But I feel a whole lot better about myself than I did two years ago [she gained two stone as a stay-at-home mum] Everywhere I go people stop me to say how much they loved me on that show.’ While Fiona was happy in Swindon, she wanted more of a buzz. They sold the vicarage for ‘considerably less’ than the £2.75 million asking price and moved to Cheltenham. ‘We go through different phases in our lives. I’m entering the next phase and pre-empting the empty nest syndrome. James is in London now and Lucy’s about to start a gap year. ‘The children weren’t appreciating the country idyll. Suddenly, we thought, ‘we don’t need it any more.’ ‘Neil and I feel this is our time. We can do all the things we could never do when we got married because we had James so we had an instant family. We never had alone time. ‘We’re both excited about creating a life here in Cheltenham.’ The renovations should be complete by September. Hopefully, by then, the tree saga will be forgotten. ‘The first people I invite round will be the bridge club,’ she announces with a smile. Whether they come or not, remains to be seen.","Neighbours accused Fiona Fullerton of 'vandalism' by removing trees .

"By . Francesca Chambers . Hillary Clinton's presidential popularity has dropped significantly since she launched a media blitz to promote her new book Hard Choices, a poll taken over the weekend shows. The presumed 2016 presidential candidate still leads her likely Republican challengers by double digits, but her share of the vote dropped under 50 percent in the latest Zogby Analytics poll. 'Some pundits suggest that it is good that former Secretary of State . Hillary Clinton is airing her dirty linen and making her campaign . mistakes now with over two years to go until the 2016 elections, ' pollster John Zogby said in a post on the company's website. 'Others, . me included, argue that this lackluster performance is not likely to go . away.' Zogby's findings echo Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus' comments on Sunday morning that voters are getting 'Hillary fatigue.' Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinto prepares to sign copies of her book Hard Choices at a Little Rock, Arkansas, Wal-Mart on Friday night . Hillary and Bill Clinton have been in the news nearly every day throughout the past month and a half as Hillary geared up for and then launched her second memoir. Much of the coverage of the former first family has not been favorable, as both heads of the Clinton household have struggled to explain away issues with Hillary health and the massive amount of money they've added to their pocketbooks since departing the White House a decade ago. Zogby's poll intimates that the Clintons' many appearances throughout the last several months have done more to hurt Hillary Clinton's chances in 2016 should she run for president than it has to help. In a hypothetical match-up against former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, Zogby found that Clinton would win with 47 percent of the vote to Bush's 35 percent, and 12 percent of voters would select 'other'. Only five percent of voters said they weren't sure who they would pick. While Clinton still holds a commanding lead over Bush, support for the former secretary of state has dropped four points in the last month. In May she led him 49 -32. Likewise, Clinton would only beat Kentucky Senator Rand Paul by 12 points, down from 21 points in March and 17 points in May. She holds the most significant lead over embattled New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, whom she would beat by 15 points. Even her edge over Christie, who has suffered through his own share of problems in the last year, has declined since March, dropping from 26 points in March to 16 points in May. Zogby did not ask or would not say how Clinton would fare against other rumored 2016 candidates. Former Florida Governor and prospective 2016 presidential candidate Jeb Bush, pictured here in February, isn't getting on American's nerves like Hillary and Bill Clinton, Republican National Committee chair Reince Priebus observed on Sunday, because he and his family have stayed fairly quiet over the last few months . The latest Zogby Analytics poll is consistent with the outcome of a recent Ramussen Reports survey that found that found Clinton would beat potential general election opponents by 11-14 points. Only Paul came within striking distance of the Democratic front-runner, and the right-leaning polling group found Clinton would still win with seven points to spare. That poll tested Clinton against Texas Governor Rick Perry, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, in addition to Paul and Christie. It did not ask respondents about Jeb Bush. On Sunday, Republican Party head Reince Priebus postulated that Americans are already growing tired of the Clinton 'show' two and a half years out from the presidential election. 'There’s Hillary fatigue out there. It’s setting in,' Priebus said on Meet the Press. 'And I just happen to believe that this early run . for the White House is going to come back and bite them. And it already . is. People are tired of it,' he said. The reason Americans are not as sick of Bush, despite being part of the Bush political dynasty, is because he and his family aren't in the public eye as often as Bill and Hillary, Priebus told Meet the Press host David Gregory. 'I don’t think Jeb and the Bushes are being as obnoxious,' the Republican leader said.","The Clintons have been in the news for a different reason every day since Hillary's book blitz began in late May .
Much of the coverage about the former first family has not been favorable as both Bill and Hillary have stumbled over questions about Hillary's health and their wealth .
Now, Americans are getting what Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus calls 'Hillary fatigue'
In hypothetical match-ups against other prospective 2016 presidential candidates, Hillary Clinton would beat Republican contenders, but by an increasing smaller margin ."
"By . Lizzie Parry . A study by the Food Packaging Forum found 175 chemicals linked to cancer and fertility problems. Stock image . Some food packaging contains hazardous chemicals linked to cancer and fertility, a new study has warned. More than 170 dangerous chemicals are legally used in the production of food packaging, scientists have found. They warned the toxic substances, which were found to cause cancer and inflict changes on genes, could end up in the food they contain. But the Food Standards Agency moved to reassure consumers, explaining all food packaging falls within European standards and the presence of the chemicals are of no concern if they are used within the 'limits or restrictions' set for their use. The study, published in the journal Food Additives and Contaminants, discovered around 175 chemicals with varying affects. They found the substances interfered with sperm production, caused genital malformations and disrupted hormone production in the body. Doctor Jane Muncke, managing director of the Food Packaging Forum, which conducted the study, said: 'From a consumer perspective, it is . certainly undesirable and also unexpected to find chemicals of concern . being intentionally used in food contact materials.' The list of chemicals found in the packaging, includes those that accumulate in the environment and the human body. Phthalates, which are widely used as plasticisers, are one example of substances which can cause male fertility and cancer. Benzophenones and organotin compounds, found in printing inks and the coatings of food wrappings, were also found. Researchers found some foil, cans, pans and storage containers released substances into food at low levels, to be ingested be people on a daily basis. Dr Muncke said the majority of the chemicals of concern identified in the study fulfill the criteria of 'Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC)', set  by REACH - the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals. Under European rules, chemicals that come under this criteria have to be registered and authorised for use, but the guidelines do not cover food packaging. Dr Muncke told the Daily Express: 'REACH currently covers consumer products such as toys, but food is different. The study warned the substances, found in foil, cans and some containers, could end up in the food they contain. But the Food Standards Agency said the chemicals are safe if within the restricted limits set by EU guidelines. Stock image . Among the chemicals scientists discovered were benzophenones, which are found in plastics . 'We are saying why don't we bring it together so that we can have a regulation where chemicals used in food packaging would need similar notification before usage.' She added: 'As a . consequence, chemicals with highly toxic properties may legally be used . in the production of food contact materials, but not in other consumer . products such as computers, textiles and paints even though exposure . through food contact materials may be far more relevant.' The report states: 'Food contact materials (FCMs) are one possible source of food contaminationm because chemicals may migrate from the material into the food. 'More than 6,000 FCM substances appear on regulatory or non-regulatory lists, some of these substances have been linked to chronic diseases.' A Food Standards Agency spokesman moved to reassure people, that food packaging is safe and meet European standards. He said: 'Consumers should not be concerned by the presence of chemicals in food contact materials if they are used within any limits or restrictions set for their use.' The report states: 'Food contact materials (FCMs) are one possible source of food contaminationm because chemicals may migrate from the material into the food' Formaldehyde . Piperonylbutoxide .

"By . Paul Donnelley . Five Hungarians are under medical care after it was suspected they were exposed to anthrax, authorities have said. ANTSZ, the country's health authority, said that the disease was found in frozen meat. It is believed that the beef came from two cattle from a farm in the eastern Hungarian town of Tiszafured where they had been illegally slaughtered. Scroll down for video . Deadly: The anthrax spores seen under a microscope . The five are believed to be workers in the abattoir and were infected during the slaughter. Some of the meat was sent to a firm that runs canteens. They have been ordered to remain closed during the investigation. ANTSZ said that it was trying to find out if anyone else who had come into contact with either the animals or the workers had been infected. This baby's arm is infected with cutaneous anthrax. Initially, it was thought to be a spider's bite but the mother worked at an American newspaper, which had been sent anthrax spores in the post . An injection of Bacillusanthracis (left), a bacterium that causes the disease . Anthrax, can build up the immune system against possible exposure to the . bacteria; Tiszafured (right) in Hungary is the scene of the latest infection - five people who work in the local abattoir . If identified early enough, said ANTSZ, the infection can be treated with antibiotics. Other animals that may have been exposed to the disease are being vaccinated. An ANTSZ statement said: ‘Authorities have taken the necessary measures, so there is no longer an immediate danger.’ In 2001 during the terror attacks on America, anthrax was sent to a number of people including senators (right). Five people died and 22 others needed medical treatment. Anthrax is an acute disease caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis. Most forms of the disease are lethal. Anthrax spores can lay dormant for years and then become reactivated. Anthrax is not spread by physical contact but by spores. Once infected humans suffer cold or flu symptoms for some days before pneumonia sets in followed by severe (and often fatal) respiratory collapse. Historical mortality was 92 per cent, but, when treated early the figures reduces to 45 per cent.","Workers in abattoir infected during illegal slaughter of cattle .

"By . John Hall . A British student who was hoping to become the fastest and youngest woman to row 2,400 miles across the Pacific has quit - after only managing to stay on course for 60 miles. Elsa Hammond, 29, planned on single-handedly rowing from California to Hawaii as part of the Great Pacific Race - aiming to complete her challenge within 99 days to break the world record. But bad weather and strong currents blew her well off course early on and after a total of 37 days she is just 60 miles closer to the finish line, having drifted 500 miles off her planned route. Withdrawal: Elsa Hammond, 29, planned on single-handedly rowing from California to Hawaii as part of the Great Pacific Race but bad weather and strong currents blew her 500 miles off course . Wrong direction: Elsa Hammond was aiming to complete her challenge within 99 days to break the world record. But at her current rate of progress it would take her three years to reach Hawaii . The Bristol University English Literature PhD student was hoping to complete the challenge in her custom-built 22 foot ling six foot wide rowing boat withing 99 days. But at her current rate it would take her more than three-and-a-half years to reach Hawaii, so she has decided to pull out and head row with the current towards Mexico. Speaking on her blog, Ms Hammond said: 'Given the tricky conditions I have been facing since the beginning I'm much further south and further behind schedule than planned.' Funding: Ms Hammond, pictured in her boat, raised a staggering £100,000 to compete in the event and has formal sponsorship from Bristol University . Difficulties: Writing on her blog Ms Hammond said that 'tricky' conditions meant she was much further south than she had planned . Going it alone: A total eight boats are competing in the Great Pacific Race but Ms Hammond was the only solo competitor . 'I am being advised that, even if I do manage to punch my way westward against the wind and waves from this position, the likelihood of meeting volatile weather (tropical cyclones, hurricanes) is greatly increased by the more southerly latitude that I'll be rowing at and the increasing lateness of the year,' she added. 'I've thought long and hard about this, and have decided, with advice, that the most sensible decision is to alter course for a different destination,' she went on to say. Off course: Bad weather and strong currents have blown Elsa Hammond 500 miles off her planned route from Monterey in California to Hawaii. After a total of 37 days she is still only 60 miles closer to the finish line . Troubled waters: The oarswoman was unable to make significant progress against the strong headwinds and has drifted directly south instead of west . Heartbreak: Ms Hammond, from Bristol, said she was disappointed that she had now altered her course and pulled out the race but felt it was the right thing to do . Ms Hammond raised a staggering £100,000 to compete in the event and has formal sponsorship from Bristol University and a number of small businesses in the area. A total eight boats are competing in the Great Pacific Race but Ms Hammond is the only solo competitor. The others are made up of between two or four sailors. Ms Hammond set off from Monterey in California on June 8 with the aim of become the fastest and youngest woman in history to single-handedly complete the route. But she has been unable to make significant progress against the strong headwinds and has drifted directly south instead of west. Competitive: Elsa Hammond is pictured alongside a model of the custom made boat she was using to try and row the Pacific. Ms Hammond set off from Monterey in California on June 8 with the aim of become the fastest and youngest woman in history to single-handedly complete sail to Hawaii . Ms Hammond has traveled a total 560 miles and actually has the highest 'miles per rower' of anyone in the race. But because she is heading in the wrong direction, she is just 60 miles closer to Hawaii and is therefore in last place but quite a considerable distance. Meanwhile, the other competitors have powered ahead and are now just 1,282 miles from finishing. Ms Hammond, from Bristol, said she was disappointed that she had now altered her course and pulled out the race but felt it was the right thing to do. Backed: Elsa Hammond raised £100,000 to compete and has formal sponsorship from Bristol University . 'I am disappointed not to be completing what I set out to do, but I am confident that this is the right decision, and one that does not put an end to the journey,' she said. 'There are many risks involved in ocean rowing, and I started in the full knowledge of these, but the balance is now tipping to those risks becoming too great,' she added. I would rather alter course to a new route and make land under my own power now, than run the increasing risk of needing to be airlifted out later and putting my and others' lives in danger. Ms Hammond was raising money for The Plastic Oceans Foundation environmental charity and gender equality charity, the GREAT Initiative. She has previously unicycled across England to raise money for a four-month conservation expedition to Borneo and attempted to climb the challenging Black Cuillin ridge on the Isle of Skye.Great Pacific Race director Chris Martin said: 'We are sad to hear that after more than a month of battling against adverse weather conditions, Elsa has decided to postpone her row to Hawaii.' 'We commend her in making a very difficult decision and having the dedication to complete her current journey by touching land under her own power,' he added.","Elsa Hammond, 29, planned to single-handedly row across Pacific Ocean .

"By . Ben Spencer . and Tania Steere . Rubbish record: Under Pickles' watch, many places in the U.K have lost weekly bin collections, something he once called a 'fundamental right' More than five million families have lost weekly bin collections since the Government came to power, the Daily Mail has discovered. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles declared two years ago that having bins emptied once a week was a ‘fundamental right’ – but cutbacks to the service have accelerated under his watch, with 60 councils introducing a fortnightly waste collection since May 2010. Eleven authorities, including both Tory and Labour councils, have dumped weekly collections in the past year alone, with two more planning to follow suit soon. By the time of the election next year, 18.5million families will have lost weekly bin rounds. Council leaders last night said that Mr Pickles’ efforts to reverse the trend – including a £250million fund to persuade councils to keep weekly bin rounds – had been a ‘sham and PR stunt’. Once-a-week household rubbish collections came into law in 1875 to stamp out cholera and other plagues which claimed huge numbers of lives. They were maintained until after Labour’s 1997 election victory. But now councils are coming up with even more extreme measures in a bid to reduce collection costs. Next month, Falkirk Council will cut collections to once every three weeks, and Swansea Council is to fine residents who put out more than three bin bags a fortnight. Mr Pickles admitted last week he was powerless to stop the erosion of waste services – a dramatic concession after years of claims he could reverse the trend. Back in 2012, he announced a £250million fund that was meant to herald the return of weekly collections. Some of the collection services have been reduced to even fewer than once a fortnight. These residents in Wallisdown, Poole, have to wait three weeks for their rubbish to be collected . While some councils used it to keep weekly collections, none have brought back weekly bin rounds and many have instead used the fund to increase recycling schemes. Labour-run Sheffield Council was given £500,000 to protect weekly collections for 30,000 flats in high-rise blocks. But it said had it been given more it would have been able to keep weekly rounds at 210,000 homes which have since been scrapped. Councillor Jack Scott, the council’s environment boss, said: ‘It was obvious from the start that this £250million fund was nothing more than a sham and a PR stunt. ‘We wrote to Eric Pickles several times making it clear that we wanted to keep weekly collections if he would give us the money. He refused. The truth is, more councils have been forced to move to alternate week collections since this Government came to power due to the unprecedented level of cuts.’ Hilary Benn, Labour’s communities spokesman, said: ‘It’s a disgrace that Eric Pickles wasted £250million on his bin scheme, which shows that while he talks a lot he can’t deliver.’ Brandon Lewis, Minister for Local Government, said the Coalition had safeguarded weekly bin collections for six million homes . But Mr Pickles said last week  that his actions had stopped the movement towards universal fortnightly collections. He told the BBC: ‘It is a matter for local authorities, but what I have done is remove the inevitability of fortnightly collections. We have made a big difference.’ Mr Pickles' Department for Communities and Local Government, which only has authority over councils in England, claims that it has slowed down the movement towards fortnightly bin collections. Before the Coalition came into power in 2010 councils were actively encouraged to move towards less frequent bin rounds. The Welsh Government, which is Labour-led, still has a policy of adopting fortnightly rounds. Brandon Lewis, Minister for Local Government, said: 'Our weekly collections support scheme has safeguarded the weekly service of six million homes and axed the Labour Government’s policy of forcing fortnightly collections for all. 'We have scrapped Labour’s plans for new bin taxes, are reining in unfair bin fines and axed bin snoopers’ powers of entry into your home. 'Yes, there is more to do – but contrast our record with the Labour-led Welsh Government, which has killed off weekly collections and now wants monthly bin collections. 'It is a myth that fortnightly collections are needed to save money or increase recycling, peddled by town hall bureaucrats and bin barons who don’t care about frontline services.'","Eric Pickles said two years ago having bins emptied was 'fundamental right'

"By . John Hall . Islamist militants fighting for ISIS in Iraq and Syria have paid tribute to an alleged British-born fighter that they say was killed during a battle with Iraqi SWAT forces. Social media accounts understood to belong to ISIS members currently fighting in the Middle East said a Briton referred to by the nom de guerre Abul Baraa was killed fighting government forces near Ramadi - a town 75 miles west of Baghdad. The news comes as Iraq sent an additional 4,000 mainly Shi'ite troops to the embattled town to help bolster government forces locked in a running battle with Sunni militants. Militants: ISIS members fighting in the Middle East (pictured) said a Briton referred to as Abul Baraa - a known nom de guerre of Abdul Raqib Amin - was killed fighting government forces near Ramadi in Iraq . Reports that a British-born jihadist may have been killed fighting in Ramadi emerged on the social media account of Abu Dujana Al Britani - a social media savvy Islamist who says he is based in the Syrian city of Homs. The suffix 'al-Britani' refers to a fighter who has travelled to the Middle East from Britain. Over a series of four messages, Abu Dujana describes how two months ago he met two British fighters among a group of new ISIS recruits in the city of Aleppo in Syria, which he refers to by its ancient name Halab. He goes on to say that he met with a Tunisian member of this international group of trainees in the Syrian city of Raqqa yesterday, where he was told that one of the two Britons had been killed.

Abu Dujana goes on to describe the militant as 'very humble and pious' and says he had come to the Middle East against the advice of 'Jihadi peers' in the UK. Raqqa, where Abu Dujana claims to have heard news of the British militant's death, is considered the capital of the Islamic State - the name ISIS has given to its recently established caliphate. The embattled city of Ramadi, on the other hand, is in overwhelmingly Sunni territory held by the Shii'te-led Iraqi government. Defence force: Iraq has sent an additional 4,000 mainly Shi'ite troops (pictured) to the embattled town of Ramadi to help bolster government forces locked in a running battle with Sunni militants . The Shi'ite-dominated force ensuring the town remains in the hands of the government is made up almost entirely of reservists who answered calls by Iraq's leading Shia cleric Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani to take up arms against the brutal Sunni insurgency. The government's reliance on Shi'ite troops to fight Sunni militants is fueling fears Iraq could descend into the kind of sectarian bloodletting that engulfed the country in 2006 and 2007. Ramadi is capital of the Sunni-majority province of Anbar, much of which has fallen to ISIS forces. Insurgents took control of Ramadi and the neighbouring town of Falluja earlier this year. The government has reestablished control of Ramadi but Falluja remains in militant hands.","ISIS fighters' social media accounts post messages about 'Abul Baraa'

"By . Paul Donnelley . Brazil 2014: The gang of international ticket touts have worked their scam over four World Cups . Brazilian police have broken up a gang of international ticket touts arresting 11 people in a scam worth £52million ($90m) and covering four World Cups. The police said that the man they suspect of being the leader of the gang, Mohamadou Lamine Fofana, was an Algerian national who ‘had free access to restricted Fifa areas’. They have also said that they believe a Fifa official is involved in the illegal resale of tickets some of which were allocated to players. Others were intended for sponsors and Brazil team officials. Police believe some of the tickets were sold to foreign tourists. Fofana is in the country for the tournament and was staying at the Copacabana Palace hotel, where all Fifa’s top executives are staying. Fifa released a statement late last night that said they would help the Brazilian authorities but its spokesman said that they have yet to receive any information from police identifying their official who allegedly helped the ring. ‘Maybe it's not from Fifa,’ said Delia Fischer. ‘It's often easy to come to a conclusion about who is Fifa.’ Ticket for the Spain versus Chile in this year's World Cup - tickets for the competition were part of a huge scam covering four World Cups . Earlier this week police executed 20 search warrants simultaneously in Operation Jules Rimet – he was the president of Fifa and the first World Cup trophy was named after him. The suspected official, said Rio policeman Fabio Barucke, has clearance for Fifa offices, stadiums and other administrative areas where he would have access to game tickets. ‘[Fofana] has tickets from hospitality, from Match, and he was close friends with someone from Fifa who was in the middle of that negotiation - who was helping out with that negotiation.’ he said. Mr Barucke said that the suspects confessed to running the con at four World Cups. ‘The gang goes to the host country. It's possible that they only work during the World Cups as their profit is so large they can sit back in between [tournaments].’ Those arrested could face charges of money laundering, criminal association and illegally .","Rio police believe Algerian national is ringleader .

"By . Daniel Miller . This is the vintage Daimler limousine which has been gathering dust in a Romanian hotel car park for over a decade after failing to start for Prince Philip during a royal trip to Bucharest. The rare and valuable vehicle was supposed to ferry the Prince around after he arrived in the city for a key World Wildlife Fund meeting in 2001. But it was abandoned in disgrace after refusing to start for the visit and according to the hotel's car park manager nobody has wanted anything to do with it since. Disgraced: Gathering dust in a Bucharest car park, this vintage Daimler limousine is said to have been abandoned by the British consulate after failing to start for Prince Philip . The rare and valuable vehicle was supposed to ferry the Prince around after he arrived in the city for a key World Wildlife Fund meeting in 2001 . According to Bucharest Intercontinental Hotel officials and the managers of the car park underneath the hotel, the vintage Daimler DS 420 is the property of the British Embassy. And they say that despite writing to them on several occasions, the Embassy in the capital Bucharest had ignored the correspondence and were apparently refusing to have anything to do with the car. As a result car park managers now say that they have applied to the court to have the car declared as their property, and say that they plan to put it on display alongside another abandoned car from the same period that had also been left in the car park, a rusting Russian Volga. Like the Daimler, the Volga was used by senior Russian officials also on state visits. Car park manager Mihai Antol, 42, said: 'When my company took over the car park the car was already there and the old owner told us it had been there ever since it failed to start properly during the royal visit'. Taxi please: Prince Philip, the then president of WWF, is seen during his official visit to Bucharest in 2001 for which the Daimler refused to start . Mr Antol said that apparently there had been a big fuss about the fact that the official car had been checked properly to make sure it was working, and that after that nobody wanted to have anything to do with it. 'Nobody . wanted to admit it was their responsibility. Our records show it belongs . to the British Embassy and we made several requests to them to either . collect it or officially hand it over to us as they owe us a lot of . money for parking it all this time, but we have had no reply. 'I . guess it was pretty embarrassing when a Daimler arranged for the royal . visit turned out to have broken down considering it was supposed to be a . showcase for British motoring expertise.' Ownership bid: Car park managers now say that they have applied to the court to have the car declared as their property . Mystery: When contacted for a statement a spokesman for the British Embassy in Bucharest denied that the car was theirs . When . contacted for a statement a spokesman for the British Embassy in . Bucharest denied that the car was theirs, saying: 'The British Embassy . in Bucharest does not own, according to its records, a vintage car along . the lines of the technical features you describe.' And . according to officials in the UK, although the Royal family has three . such cars still at its disposal, none of them is listed as being in a . hotel in Bucharest. With the British Embassy denying ownership of the car that the Romanians say is their property, it means that the legal bid to take over ownership is unlikely to be contested, and the garage owners will find themselves the new owners of a rare vintage car even if it never worked properly. The license plates were apparently removed or stolen years ago and the original tyres are flat, but nevertheless the Daimler DS 420 is not only rare but also extremely valuable. Only 4,116 units were produced between 1968-1992 and it was the car of choice for the various lavish receptions of the British Royal family for years. With a length of over 12 foot and weighing more than two tons, the models are equipped with a huge 4.2 liter petrol engine capable of delivering 245 horsepower, that made it a favourite not just with the British Royal family but also with many other heads of state. A similar vehicle which once belonged to the Prince of Qatar is currently listed for a sale on a classic car website for £35,000.","Daimler DS 420 has been left in Bucharest hotel car park since 2001 .

"By . Daniel Miller . A millionaire businessman known as 'The Bitcoin Jesus' turned the tables on a hacker who was attempting to blackmail him by offering $20,000 worth of the digital currency as a reward for his capture. U.S. born Roger Ver has amassed a small fortune in Bitcoins after investing heavily from 2011 and using the currency, which has since exploded in value, to back a number of start-up firms. But last week he received a threatening message from a hacker known as Nitrous who had taken control of an old Hotmail account using it to steal personal information including Mr Ver's social security and passport numbers. Bitcoin Jesus: U.S businessman Roger Ver turned the tables on a hacker who had broken into one of his old email accounts and was trying to blackmail him . Nitrous then threatened to sell the information to fraudsters unless Mr Ver paid him 37 bitcoins - worth a cool $20,000, Wired magazine reports. Although Mr Ver is believed to be easily be able to afford such a sum, he refused to pay up and instead used Facebook to offer the same amount as a reward for information that would lead to Nitrous's arrest. While Bitcoin is often trumpeted as simply being a libertarian currency and way to move money across international boundaries it is heavily linked to the sinister online marketplace SilkRoad where drugs, guns and even hitmen are offered for sale. Soon after the bounty was placed on Facebook a clearly terrifed Nitrous backed down contacting Mr Ver with a cowering apology. He wrote: 'Sir, I am sincerely sorry. I am just a middleman. I was being told what to tell you. 'Are you going to order a hitman to kill me now?' Response: Mr Ver posted this message on Facebook after which the hacker quickly backed down . It . was a far cry from the blackmailer's original messages in which he . brazenly threatened to exploit Mr Ver after seizing control of the old . email account which Mr Ver had used several years ago to register the internet domain . memorydealers.com for his computer parts business. After . taking over the account Nitrous was not only able to access Mr Ver's . personal information but also that of his mother which he threatened to . sell to 'fraudsters' who would 'ruin both of your lives'. 'I think we . both know this won’t be pleasent [sic] and let’s be honest: there is . nothing you can do to have me caught. I’ve been around too long,' Nitrous wrote, before adding: 'I have to say: I respect you as a BTC . user/icon. 'Let's . be honest I will sell your information to fraudsters that will credit . f*** you then get your moms social and credit f*** her too and ruin both . your lives.' '37.6 BTC isn't worth s*** to you, the damage I cause to you financially/family-wise will be way worse than that.' Mr . Ver, who is now based in Japan, decided to stall for time, attempting . to negotiate with Nitous, while he and close associate Jason Maurice, chief hacking officer of Japanese security startup Wiz . Technologies, attempted to wrestle back control of the hacked accounts. After an hour-long exchange through Skype, Nitous attempted to up the ante, threatening to 'own' Ver 10,0000 times harder. Demand: Nitrous was asking for 37 Bitcoins - worth $20,000 - from Mr Ver after hacking into his email account . 'You Fag,' he wrote. 'Listen, my mom needs a liver transplant that starts at $15,000, man…I am so sorry for having to do this, but it’s just what I have to do.' But Ver cooly responded by posting a link to the Facebook post offering the reward and Nitrous quickly backed down. He then wrote: 'Sir, I am sincerely sorry I am just a middleman I was being told what to tell you. 'I was seriously being told what to tell you by someone else I don't even know what's going on. 'Please stop I am so sorry I told him that you are now going to have me killed over something he made me do I didn't even do this it was someone else.' Mr Ver said he has not been contacted by the hacker since. What is a bitcoin? Bitcoins are basically just lines of computer code that are digitally signed each time they travel from one owner to the next. They are the basic unit of a new online economy which runs independently of any company, bank, or government. Because bitcoins allow people to trade money without a third party getting involved, they have become popular with libertarians as well as technophiles, speculators — and criminals. Who's behind the currency? It's a mystery. Bitcoin was launched in 2009 by a person or group of people operating under the name Satoshi Nakamoto and then adopted by a small clutch of enthusiasts.Nakamoto dropped off the map as Bitcoin began to attract widespread attention, but proponents say that doesn't matter; the currency obeys its own, internal logic. What's a bitcoin worth? Like any other currency, bitcoins are only worth as much as you and your counterpart want them to be. In its early days, boosters swapped bitcoins back and forth for minor favors or just as a game. One website even gave them away for free. As the market matured, the value of each bitcoin grew. Is the currency widely used? That's debatable. Businesses ranging from blogging platform Wordpress to retailer Overstock have jumped on the Bitcoin bandwagon amid a flurry of media coverage, but it's not clear whether the currency has really taken off. On the one hand, leading bitcoin payment processor BitPay works with more than 20,000 businesses — roughly five times more than it did last year. On the other, the total number of bitcoin transactions has stayed roughly constant at between 60,000 and 70,000 per day over the same period, according to bitcoin wallet site blockchain.info. Is Bitcoin particularly vulnerable to counterfeiting? The Bitcoin network works by harnessing individuals' greed for the collective good. A network of tech-savvy users called miners keep the system honest by pouring their computing power into a blockchain, a global running tally of every bitcoin transaction. The blockchain prevents rogues from spending the same bitcoin twice, and the miners are rewarded for their efforts by being gifted with the occasional bitcoin. As long as miners keep the blockchain secure, counterfeiting shouldn't be an issue.","Hacker 'Nitrous' had seized control of email account belonging to Roger Ver .

"By . Daniel Miller . Shamed baseball star Alex Rodriguez hits one of his 54 home runs  during the 2007 after being given special permission to use testosterone . Banned baseball star Alex Rodriguez was granted special permission to use performance-enhancing testosterone during the 2007 season, it has emerged. Rodriguez, who enjoyed a career high in 2007 scoring a major-league leading 54 home runs, was handed a therapeutic use exemption (TUE) to use testosterone, just two days before the start of spring training. The shamed Yankees star is suspended from playing this season while he serves a 211 game suspension for using performance enhancing drugs including testosterone and human growth hormone over the course of several seasons. He also failed a steroid test in 2003. Details of the 2007 exemption emerged in the transcript of a grievance hearing held in August last year when Rodriguez unsuccessfully appealed the 211-game ban, according to a new book, Blood Sport: Alex Rodriguez, Biogenesis and the Quest to End Baseball's Steroid Era. According to the book Rodriguez, 38, was one of two players who were granted TUEs for androgen deficiency medications at the start of the 2007 season. Testosterone, which has been banned by baseball since 2003, was described by Major League Baseball's chief operating officer Rob Manfred as 'the mother of all anabolics'. Mr Manfred is quoted in the book as saying exemptions for the substance are 'very rare,' adding: 'some people who have been involved in this field feel that with a young male, healthy young male, the most likely cause of low testosterone requiring this type of therapy would be prior steroid abuse'. The hearing transcript also revealed that Rodriguez applied for a further two exemptions in 2008 and was given permission to use the drug Clomid which is prescribed to men suffering from hypogonadism. Banned: Rodriguez is currently serving a 211 game suspension after being caught using Human Growth Hormone . However he was denied permission to use . human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), a testosterone-producing drug which . is sometimes used for weight loss. MLB officials said in a statement: 'All decisions regarding whether a player shall receive a therapeutic use exemption (TUE) under the Joint Drug Program are made by the Independent Program Administrator (IPA) in consultation with outside medical experts, with no input by either the Office of the Commissioner or the Players Association. Details of the 2007 exemption emerged in a transcript of Rodriguez's grievance hearing held in August last year, according to a new book, Blood Sport: Alex Rodriguez, Biogenesis and the Quest to End Baseball's Steroid Era . 'The process is confidentially . administered by the IPA, and MLB and the MLBPA are not even made aware . of which players applied for TUEs. 'The TUE process under the Joint Drug Program is comparable to the process under the World Anti-Doping Code. 'The standard for receiving a TUE for a medication listed as a performance-enhancing substance is stringent, with only a few such TUEs being issued each year by the IPA. MLB and the MLBPA annually review the TUE process to make sure it meets the most up-to-date standards for the issuance of TUEs.' While the Yankees failed to qualify for the World Series in 2007, Rodriguez enjoyed a standout season being voted Most Valuable Player by a landslide and becoming at 32, the youngest player in history to hit 500 home runs. He smashed a total of 54 home runs, drove in 156 runs and scored 143. He was subsequently signed to a 10-year deal with the Yankees worth at least $275 million with further $6 million bonuses for every all-time home run leader's record he broke starting with Willie Mays at 660 and ending with Barry Bonds at 762. The deal made him the richest man in baseball by a wide margin. His current net worth is valued at $300m. He was banned last year after it emerged he had been been receiving banned Human Growth Hormone from Florida anti-aging clinic Biogenesis of America. He was one of 13 players suspended for their roles in the scandal. To purchase a copy of the book click here.","Shamed star was given permission to use androgen deficiency medications .

Mr Killian, 53, was putting out the bonfire when Sharrod burst through his hedge and began attacking him with the hammer. An eye-witness described Mr Killian's battered head and face as 'like something from a horror film.'The attack was halted by Mr Killian's wife who ran into the garden after hearing her husband's screams. Mrs Killian told a court she feared her husband was being murdered when she saw Sharrod astride of her husband. Injuries: Mr Killian suffered horrific injuries to his head following the attack last year . Keen gardener Mr Killian survived the attack but needed surgery to head and facial wounds. Sharrod claimed he had hit his neighbour 'once or twice' with the hammer which he had found in his garden. The weapon was never recovered.

Sharrod is expected to return to his mobile home in Parkmill, Swansea, one of several on a residential caravan site bordering the back of Mr Killian's three-bedroom detached property. Father-of-two Mr Killian said: 'When he was locked up we hoped that would be the last we'd see of him. 'But we have been told by his landlord that he is returning soon - probably in July.

A 47-year-old British holidaymaker was able to fly to Spain using her 17-year-old daughter's passport, despite the fact the youngster has different skin colour and a distinctive afro hair-do. Blundering officials at Southend Airport in Essex failed to notice that Sally Nayler is a middle aged white woman while the passport she was using showed a mixed race teenager.

She . was left distraught days later when officials in Alicante refused to . allow her to board her return flight to Britain after she failed to . produce her own passport. She said: 'My mouth dropped to the floor,' she said. 'I was literally about to step on the plane. I have never been so frightened in my life. I was shaking and I was sweating. I was crying. 'Other passengers were getting upset for me. A lot of them had been on the flight out with us. They were saying: 'let her on, let her on'. 'I said I'd been there since Friday. The EasyJet man asked if I had any photo ID but I'd left my driving licence at home because I was going on a hen do.' Sally, a single mum of one, said she was so traumatised that an aunt who was also on the hen do volunteered to stay with her while the rest of the 12-strong party flew home. 'The Spanish policeman said he would have let me go, but it wasn't down to him. 'We went to the EasyJet desk at the airport and the woman there apologised and said it was EasyJet's fault at Southend. They shouldn't have let me fly on that passport.' EasyJet booked Sally and her aunt onto a flight the following day, and gave them free tickets. They also helped them find an hotel near the British Consulate, were they went for emergency travel documents the following day. Sally had to pay 121 Euros for a new passport - which invalidated the brand new one she'd left behind - plus a night's accommodation and food. Probe: An investigation has been launched into how Ms Nayler was able to board the flight from Southend Airport in Essex with her daughter's documents .

She said . that on the flight out she handed her passport and boarding pass to . EasyJet staff at Southend, as they put their hand luggage in the hold . because of a shortage of space. She assumed that it had been checked. She added: 'I think it shows security is lacking at Southend Airport. I could have been a criminal or a terrorist.

Grounded: Spanish authorities refused to allow Ms Nayler to board her return flight home . British Consulate staff worked with airline EasyJet to arrange for an emergency passport and a return flight the next day. Ms Nayler added: 'I'm a grown woman, but it was really scary. 'Thankfully, an aunt refused to fly back without me and stayed with me. 'The EasyJet desk at Alicante got me a hotel near the consulate and arranged a flight back the next day on an emergency passport, which cancels my old passport. 'If Southend had spotted it, I could have got my father to bring mine. 'We had a wonderful weekend, but this spoilt it.' A spokeswoman for Southend Airport has apologised for the mistake and said a full investigation was currently underway into the incident. She said: 'Security and the safety of passengers and aircraft are of paramount concern. 'A full investigation is in progress into the circumstances outlined by .

A spokesman for the airline said: 'EasyJet works closely with all of our airports to ensure the safety and security of all passengers and staff. 'We are investigating how the passenger was able to travel from London Southend with incorrect documentation. 'We can confirm that the correct passport details had been submitted online in order to gain access to the boarding pass, however as an additional measure a visual identification should have occurred prior to travel.

It followed a five-part mini series broadcast on North Koprean State Television entitled 'Let us trim our hair in accordance with Socialist lifestyle' with the aim of promoting short back and sides for its male population. Earlier this week British hairdresser sparked a diplomatic incident when he placed a cheeky poster in his window with a picture of Kim Jong-Un to publicise special discounts for people having a 'bad hair day'.","Will Marks, 30, was one of 150 foreign runners to enter the event .

A Greek grandmother has been hailed a heroine after keeping her cool and putting her faith in the Lord when an earthquake struck, by simply crossing herself and praying while those around her fled in terror. The powerful  6.4 magnitude quake hit the islands of Lemnos and Samothrace in the northern part of the Aegean Sea on Saturday rocking building and sending people rushing into the streets in panic. But CCTV video shows grandmother Georgia Mirmoudi, 76, calmly sitting in a chair in a grocery shop, refusing to budge as the store manager and customers race for the door. Scroll down for video . Cool customer: Grandmother Georgia Mirmoudi sits calmly in a chair in a grocery shop moments before the earthquake hit . The fearless pensioner simply makes the sign of the cross repeatedly and starts to pray. The camera can be seen shaking as the building vibrates but the old woman who was eventually left alone continues praying and looking completely unconcerned. A few seconds after that the young man Nikolas Papadopoulos, 34, who spotted that she was still inside, ran back inside and hauled her to her feet, but she refused to be rushed. Panic: As the quake hit a shopper rushes for the door, but Mrs Mirmoudi remains seated and begins crossing herself and praying . No hurry: The 76-year-old continues to cross herself while the building vibrates from the force of the quake . When she drops her purse she pushes him away and turns back in order to pick up the purse. She then decides to sit down again and carries on with her prayers. Once things were settled and the building had stopped shaking, she then got up and walked out telling those gathered in the middle of the street that they should have more faith in the Lord. She said: 'I knew it would be okay. I wasn't worried. Today was not my day.' Afterwards she said she was delighted at all the attention the video was getting if it encouraged people to take religion more seriously and realise the power that it had to help. A young man spotted Mrs Mirmoudi was still inside and hauled her to her feet, but she dropped her purse and then refused to leave the store and simply continued to cross herself . The 6.4 magnitude earthquake that struck off the coast of northern Greece was felt as far away as neighbouring Turkey and Bulgaria but there were no reports of serious casualties or destruction, police and fire brigade officials said. The mayor of Lemnos, Antonis Chatzidiamantis, said the quake had caused minor damage to shops and houses on the two islands but added: 'Almost like a miracle no one has been hurt, despite the fact that a 5.9 magnitude quake in 1999 killed 143 people.' Greece, at the south-eastern end of Europe, is often buffeted by earthquakes and apparently the only person to be hurt was a British tourist who had been hit on the head by a lump of debris when a ceiling collapsed at an airport.

"By . Daniel Miller . Emma Bootland with five-year-old daughter Laiyla who was found wandering near a busy street after walking out of her school disco . A furious mother has told how her five-year-old daughter was able to walk out of her primary school disco alone and was found wandering the streets over a quarter of a mile away. Laiyla Nelson had walked almost half of the 15-minute route to her home in York, crossing at least two roads when she was discovered cold, frightened and alone by next-door neighbour Daniel Cooper. Her mother Emma Bootland had been on her way to pick her up from the end of term disco at St. Barnabas Primary School when Mr Cooper called. Laiyla, who only celebrated her 5th . birthday last week, hadn’t even picked up her coat when she left the . school hall and started to make her way home - unbeknown to teachers. Mrs . Bootland, 23, said: 'My neighbour rang me and said ""I’ve got Laiyla"" so . my first thought was that he had picked her up with his daughter Libby. 'I . was already walking to the school and started to thank him for getting . her when he explained that he had found her walking on her own. 'My . first thought was how? How was she walking on her own? How was she let . out of school? All the thoughts of what might of happened started going . through my head. 'She had no coat on, she just had her little blouse and leggings that she had worn to the disco. 'When . I got to her I asked her why she didn’t go in to the shop where the . owners know her, but she said ""you told me not to speak to strangers"".

'When I asked her why she had left the school she said ""I saw other mummy and daddy’s and thought you would be there"". 'I . went straight to the school and they hadn’t even realised she had gone. I was so upset. By this point Laiyla was in tears too.' Laiyla, who only celebrated her fifth birthday last week, hadn't even picked up her coat when she left the school hall . Despite teachers using a checklist to tick off the tots leaving, Emma believes Laiyla had managed to just walk out without being noticed and started the 15-minute walk home by herself. She added: 'I think it’s disgusting that she was found on a street corner. 'She was nearly halfway home, she didn’t even have her coat on and was freezing. 'I don’t know how long she had been out there for, she couldn’t tell me. 'If your children aren’t safe at school, where are they safe?'

She said: 'An incident like this has never happened at St Barnabas’s school before and in conjunction with our governors and staff we have put measures in place to reassure parents that this does not happen again.' Mrs Bootland, a customer services agent, said she is yet to receive a written apology from the school and is still uncertain what to do next. She added: 'When I went to the school I told them Laiyla would not be coming back. I was just so angry. 'I had an apology on that night but since then I’ve had no phonecall, no letter, no explanation at all. 'Laiyla really doesn’t want to leave her school and has a lot of friends there.

"By . Daniel Miller . A second Army officer has resigned his commission to publish a harrowing, warts-and-all account of the human cost to the British Army of the war in Afghanistan. Earlier this week Oxford-educated Territorial Army captain Dr Mike Martin, who was commissioned by the MoD to write a book about the war, quit when Whitehall later attempted to block its publication. Now former reserve Captain Christian Hill has resigned so he can publish what promises to be a highly-embarrassing account of his time serving with the Army's Media Operations Group. Former reserve Captain Christian Hill has become the second Army officer to resign in order to publish a warts and all account of the Afghanistan war . Mr Hill's role in Afghanistan was to promote positive coverage of the war in the UK media, creating the impression that the campaign was having a positive effect and that the Army was in control. But according to his book Combat Camera, due to be published next week, that was often far from the case. Mr Hill, who now works as a journalist for the BBC in Nottingham, said he would regularly witness soldiers being brought back to camp with limbs blown off by IED explosions. He told the Independent: That was never something we were going to shout from the rooftops to the press but I grew uncomfortable with the fact people back home were not really being made aware of this. He added: 'Lie is too strong a word for it. Our key message was that we were in the process of helping Afghanistan. 'I wasn't exactly Goebbels but I was conscious of seeing a number of guys getting badly injured - you never heard so much about that in the press.' British troops boarding a Chinook helicopter in Helmand in 2009 because traveling by road had become so dangerous . Mr Hill said he would regularly see soldiers returning to base with their limbs blown off by IED explosions . In total, 448 British lives have been lost in Afghanistan, including (from top row left to right) Sergeant Nigel Coupe, Corporal Jake Hartley and Private Anthony Frampton, with (bottom row left to right) Private Christopher Kershaw, Private Daniel Wade and Private Daniel Wilford. An inquest heard that the six soldiers were killed when a bomb destroyed their vehicle in Helmand . After being handed a copy of Combat . Camera in December last year, the MoD told Mr Hill that his book would . be subject to a 35 day clearance review which would be handed to top . brass who could block publication. When . he failed to get a response to a request for clarification on any . possible national security breaches he decided to step down. Mr Hill said he was not surprised that Dr Martin resigned in light of the fact he waited for almost a year without feedback from the MoD. Dr Martin's criticism of intelligence blunders and the failure of commanders to . understand the conflict is said to have embarrassed officials. The MoD has asked for his book to be pulped, allegedly claiming it . breaches the Official Secrets Act and uses classified material uncovered . by Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, which Dr Martin and his publisher . deny. Dr Mike Martin (pictured in fatigues above) speaking to an Afghan villager in Helmand Province. Dr Martin served as a Captain in the Territorial Army when he was commissioned to write his book . The MoD denied claims it had tried to block the book using the Official Secrets Act. A . statement on the MoD's website said the Army accepted classified . documents referred to in the book were from public sources so the final . decision not to approve publication was not based on the act. It said: 'The MoD is not in any way attempting to prevent the book's publication. 'The . Army simply decided that it was inappropriate for a serving officer to . publish a book that is so heavily critical of the Army, the MoD and our . allies. 'The existing . policy on publication of books and articles by serving military . personnel is clear and exists to ensure that our operational security . and the personal security of our people is protected.

"By . Daniel Miller . A brother and sister who were caught with 12 marijuana plants and eight seedlings inside their home have been jailed for a total of 30 years. Natalie and David DePriest received the harshest sentence which can be given for marijuana growing in the state of Missouri, where the maximum punishment for manslaughter is also 15 years. In 2011, a maintenance man entered the DePriests' home in the city of Farmington while they were out in order to fit a fire extinguisher and discovered what he thought was a pipe bomb on the kitchen counter. Jailed: Natalie, 36, and David, 34, DePriest were sentenced to 15 years in prison after police discovered 20 marijuana plants in their Missouri home . He took pictures of the device with his phone before informing the police who went round to conduct a search. Officers . discovered the plants inside a bedroom closet along with three pounds . of dried marijuana, a rifle which was a quarter inch shorter than the . legal limit, two legally-held pistols and two bulletproof vests. They . also found ledgers understood to contain sales records totaling up to . $8,000 a month. The 'pipe bomb' turned out to be harmless. The . siblings were accused of running a large drug-selling operation. David, . 34, had one prior misdemeanor drug charge dating from from 1999 while . Natalie, 36, had been charged with writing bad checks while she was out . on bail. Speaking from inside prison to the Huffington Post, Natalie, a former rep for Camel cigarettes, denied ever having sold any of the marijuana, insisting it was for personal use. She said: 'If we had thousands of dollars in pot sales, it must be buried somewhere. Because I’ve never seen it.' The . pair hired attorney Dan Viets - one of Missouri's leading marijuana . reform activists and head of the state's National Organization for the . Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) committee. Initially . they tried to fight the prosecution arguing that the police should not . have entered their home without giving them notice or obtaining a . warrant, but the motion was denied. Having spent all their money they decided to plead guilty in the hope of receiving a more lenient sentence. So . in November last year they admitted growing more than 5 grams of . marijuana and intending to distribute it. David also pleaded guilty to . owning an illegal rifle. The siblings denied running a large-scale drug dealing operation and insisted the marijuana was purely for personal use . However St. Francois County Prosecuting Attorney Jerrod Mahurin, had warned them that if they took their case to court, he would request the maximum sentences allowed. Mr Mahurin claimed he had offered the DePriests' attorney Dan Viets a deal under which they woulf serve just 120 days in jail, before being released on three years of probation, but that he refused. He told the Riverfront Times: 'There were multiple offers made that would have had them released in 120 days. 'But they felt that marijuana should not be illegal and will be legal soon, so they refused. I don't know if it will ever be legal in Missouri, but in this case I have to follow the law.' Circuit Court Judge Kenneth Pratte sentenced them to 15 years on the cultivation charge and a further 15 years for intending to distribute, with the sentences to run concourrently. David, an aspiring gunsmith, was handed an additional seven years for owning the illegal rifle. Speaking at the hearing Judge Pratte said: 'The law is the law,' addding that he didn't 'care one bit' that most Americans believe pot should be legalized. As it is their first time in jail it is unlilely either of the pair would serve their full sentence. Mr Mahurin said he expected David to be freed after four years and Natalie to serve two and a half.","Natalie, 36, and David, 34, DePriest had 12 mature plants and eight seedlings .

"By . Daniel Miller . A childless couple desperate to adopt has told of their heartbreak after being duped by a woman who pretended to be pregnant, even calling them claiming she was in the delivery room giving birth. Mark and Tracy Dziekanski from Illinois, who are unable to have a baby of their own and could not afford to adopt in the traditional way, posted an heartfelt appeal on the Craigslist website. They were soon contacted by a woman called Heather Taylor from North Carolina who said she was expecting a baby, but could to afford to keep it and was looking for a 'nice couple' to take care of it. Ordeal: Childless Illinois couple Mark and Tracy Dziekanski were duped by a heartless con artist, who claimed she was pregnant and promised to let them adopt the child . The delighted Dziekanskis thought their dream had come true and  agreed to support Taylor through the course of her pregnancy, promising her financial support. Over the next few weeks, heartless Taylor continued to string them along, sending them photographs of her posing with a mocked-up baby bump and giving regular reports on her supposed 'condition'. Then one day Mrs Dziekanski received a . call from Taylor who said she had gone into labour and was speaking to . them from the delivery room. Faked: Heather Taylor sent this picture of herself pretending to be pregnant to a couple who were looking to adopt . Taylor told them she was going to have a C-section and moments later played them a recording of a baby crying down to the phone to embellish the lie. In an interview with ABC News, Mrs Dziekanski recalled: 'She's having a C-section, and I'm ... on the phone with her in the delivery room. 'You could hear like ... the heart rate and everything, like she was really at a hospital. ... Then a couple of minutes later, there's a baby crying.' Taylor told the Dziekanskis that she had given birth to a baby girl and had named her Anna Rosemarie. She sent them a picture of a baby and promised to bring her to Illinois to meet her new parents. The Dziekanskis had been completely taken in and were overjoyed at the prospect of finally becoming parents. But before long they began to realise something was wrong. For a start, the photos Taylor was sending them of their daughter didn't appear to be of the same baby. Later Taylor told them she was in . Illinois and staying at a hotel close to their home, but said she had to . rush back home because her brother had been involved in an accident. Finally Taylor got in touch saying she had changed her mind and was going to keep the baby. The Dziekanskis went back onto . Craigslist and contacted other people who had posted adverts looking to . adopt children, asking them if they had come across anyone called . Heather Taylor. It . turned out she had played exactly the same trick on a woman from North . Carolina, who just like the Dziekanskis had been promised a baby. 'I’ll never forgive her,' Mark Dziekanski said. According to the North Carolina police,Taylor received less than $2,000 in total from both couples. Heartbreaking: Taylor later sent this picture of a baby after calling the couple claiming she was in the delivery room about to give birth by C-section . When contacted by ABC, Taylor said she hadn't done it for the money saying she did it for attention and to feel wanted. Taylor was sentenced to between 6 and 17 months in jail, which was later reduced to 36 months probation. She was also ordered to undergo mental treatment. Mark and Tracy Dziekanski say they  now have a fostering license and hope to adopt children through the fostering process.","Mark and Tracy Dziekanski are unable to have a baby of their own .

"By . Daniel Miller . An examination table used by Dr Harold Shipman, Britain's worst ever serial killer, went up for sale on eBay for £10,000. The macabre item was used by Shipman while he was a GP at the Abraham Ormerod Medical Centre in Todmorden, West Yorkshire in the 1970s, during which time he murdered dozens of his elderly patients. The padded blue medical table was listed on the auction website on Friday where it has already attracted two offers. Macabre: Marjorie Chakravarti with the examination couch once used by Harold Shipman, Britain's worst serial killer, which she has put up for sale on eBay for £10,000 . Its current owner Marjorie Chakravarti, 72, bought it in the early 1990s when she was senior nurse at the hospital where Shipman first worked as a GP, and began his murderous career. He is believed to have murdered up to 260 of his patients during a 27-year period stretching from 1971. He preyed on the vulnerable and his victims tended to be elderly women living alone. Former owner: Shipman is believed to have killed 250 of his elderly patients over a 27-year period starting from 1971 . Their ages ranged form 41 to 93 and the murders were mostly committed during home visits, usually with a lethal injection of the painkiller diamorphine. She says she purchased it for around £10 from a colleague and kept it in a garden shed for years before deciding to sell it on eBay in a decluttering exercise. The item was placed on eBay with a price tag of £10,000 which Mrs Chakravarti says might be ambitious but said she is 'high maintenance'. She said she bought it to help her with diplomas she was studying for in physiology, massage and aromatherapy. Shipman, who was based in Hyde from 1977, was investigated by police in 1998 and given 15 life sentences for murder according to police his death toll could have been as high as 215 patients. There was shock at how a seemingly outwardly respectable GP responsible for more than 3,000 patients could kill mainly elderly patients so casually. He hanged himself in 2004 at Wakefield high security jail and his death brought to an end one of the most dramatic chapters in British criminal history. A two year inquiry was instituted four years earlier to investigate all deaths certified by Shipman as the medical profession struggled to come to terms with how such a killer could have operated with such apparent ease. The table was used by Shipman . while he was a GP at the Abraham Ormerod Medical Centre in Todmorden, . West Yorkshire, now a crumbling derelict building . Marjorie Chakravarti with the examination table from serial killer Dr. Harold Shipman's former practice. The murderous GP hanged himself in 2004 at Wakefield high security jail . Mrs Chakravarti, who lives in Huddersfield, said: ""My husband is ill, I am down-sizing. I have three sheds filled with rubbish and my intention is to sell it. 'To buy one of these new would cost around £770 and that's without any history. It's in reasonable condition for its age, I think it dates from the 1940s or 50s.' Asked who might want to buy such an item she replied: 'I haven't got a clue. Perhaps someone who might want to do a diploma like me and might want a couch. 'I never met him, [Shipman], he was part of the group's practice at that time and Dr Michael Grieve was the senior partner. Ms Chakravarti bought the table from a colleague in the early 1990s for £10 and used it to help her with diplomas she was studying for in physiology, massage and aromatherapy . 'I was horrified at what Shipman did, that someone in a caring position could have committed such crimes. It's gob-smacking what he did.' She says she also bought a black chair which Shipman would have sat on but is not releasing that until she sees how much interest there is in the couch, the sale of which she admits might attract 'the ghoulish'. But it's not the only Shipman-related item that was put on the auction site. Copies of victims' death certificates and witness statements were also listed. Twisted GP Harold Shipman is the UK's most prolific convicted serial killer, having murdered up to 260 of his patients during a 27-year period stretching from 1971. Shipman studied at the Leeds . School of Medicine graduating in 1970. In 1974 he took his first position . as a general practitioner at the Abraham Ormerod Medical Centre in . Todmorden, West Yorkshire. In . 1975 he was caught forging prescriptions of pethidine, an opiate . painkiller, for his own use and was fined £600, and ordered to attended a . drug rehabilitation clinic.

Their ages ranged form 41 to 93 and the murders were mostly committed during home visits, usually with a lethal injection of the painkiller diamorphine. Some psychologists have linked his crimes to the death of his mother from lung cancer when he was 17. Like Shipman's victims, she had morphine administered at home by a doctor, a process which the young Shipman would have witnessed. In 2000, Shipman was given 15 life sentences after being found guilty of murdering 15 patients while working in Hyde, Greater Manchester. Six of Shipman's victims.

An inquiry concluded he killed between 215 and 260 people over a 23-year period in Hyde and Todmorden, West Yorkshire. Throughout his three month trial, Shipman never took responsibility for his crimes, nor gave any clues as to his motivations. Four years later, at the age of 57, he killed himself in his cell in Wakefield Prison, hanging himself with his bedsheets.","Table was used by Shipman when he was a GP in Todmorden, W. Yorkshire .

"By . Daniel Miller . When former Chinese military man Jian Lin's six-year-old son asked for a tank for his birthday, never in his wildest dreams did he think he would actually get one. But with plenty of time on his hands the youngster's father, a former Navy officer, decided he would grant his son's wishes, by building him the ultimate boy's toy. Basing his design on the People's Liberation Army's Type 63A light tank, Mr Jian set to work and just two months later he rolled out a fully functioning replica, featuring a cannon that actually fires. Present arms: Retired Chinese military man Jian Lin with the fully-functioning tank he built for his six-year-old's birthday . Mr Jian said: 'I had a look around at what was . available on the market but nothing really fitted what I wanted, which . was when I decided to have a go at making one myself. I wanted the gift . to be something really cool.' He said he had originally decided to make a smaller working model but when he realised he could easily get hold of parts such as tractor tyres and a truck engine at an affordable price, he decided to go the whole hog and make a life-size replica. He said: 'I used to work on maintaining military aircraft and later I retired and started work as a truck driver. Hardware: The doting dad spent around £4,000 building the tank which is almost five metres long, two metres high and weighs three tonnes . Road hog: Although he claims to have built the tank for his six-year-old son, the former navy officer appears to have been hogging the toy for himself . Lock and load: Proud dad Jian Lin, pictured in his old military uniform,  uses a crack to rotate his tank's turret . 'I did quite well and decided to take some time out so I sold the truck but was then at a loose end – I don't like doing nothing. So the idea for this came along at exactly the right time.' It was a hard job keeping the project under wraps but 31-year-old Mr Jian said all the work was worth it when he finally pulled off the covers of the vehicle and showed it to his son at their home in the village of Mianzhu in China's Sichuan province. The proud dad had even donned his old military uniform to take the camouflage-painted tank for a spin. It is not authorised yet for use on the road so he had to be content by driving it around a field, and even gave a demonstration of its firepower when he delighted onlookers by sending a few rounds into the air that he insisted was entirely safe – and perfectly appropriate for a child to play with. He spent around £4,000 over two months on building the tank which is almost five metres long and two metres high. Clear the way: The mighty machine is not authorised yet for use on the road so Mr Jian had to be content by driving it around a field . Real thing: The fully-functioning model is based on the People's Liberation Army's Type 63A light tank . It also weighs just three tonnes instead of the 20 tonnes the real thing weighs because none of the armour is real. The realistic looking vehicle differs from the real thing in having a special low entrance so that Wang and his friends can climb inside and outside easily. And there is no shortage of friends to join the youngster on the vehicle, even if none of them have any toy tanks of their own. But they might not have to wait long – as Jian said he enjoyed himself so much he was now planning to build a second vehicle – this time an amphibious one which can go on water. Only a few weeks ago, a Chinese grandfather built his grandson a 12 metre long and two metre wide model replica of an aircraft carrier so he had somewhere to land his toy airplanes. Sea power: Fellow Military-mad Chinese father Wen Yuzhu built this scale model aircraft carrier for his son Guo Fu . Chocks away: Wen Yuzhu with the model plane that he built to compliment his fully seaworthy model aircraft carrier . The 12-year-old youngster's aircraft carrier came into being after he was taken out by his grandfather Wen Yuzhu, 80, to a local park in the city of Qingdao in eastern China's Shandong province so he could fly his model plane. The schoolboy had joked that his grandfather, who was a keen sailor, should make him an aircraft carrier for his model. But instead of laughing off the joke the pensioner thought it was a really good idea, and a month later together with pals had managed to create a 1:25 scale model of an aircraft carrier that was launched at sea on 1 April.","Former Navy officer Jian Lin spent £4,000 on son Wang's present .

Mulayam Singh, leader of India's third biggest political party, has pledged to repeal the death penalty for rape claiming 'men make mistakes' The leader of India's third biggest political party  has sparked fury as tens of millions vote in the country's national election, by promising to scrap the recently-introduced death penalty for rape claiming 'men make mistakes, why hang them?' Mulayam Singh, leader of the Samjawadi Party, said he would repeal the law introduced in response to public outrage over a fatal gang rape in New Delhi in 2012. Addressing a rally in Moradabad, in the key state of Uttar Pradesh, Mulayam said: 'Rape accused should not be hanged. Men make mistakes. 'Efforts will be made to change such a law, so that those misusing it are punished. Those filing false reports will also be taken to task' Yadav, whose party pledges to represent 'other backward classes' said relationships between 'boys and girls' often break up. He added: 'If boys and girls have difference, and the girl goes and gives a statement that I have been raped, then the poor fellows are punished. 'Two or three have been given the death sentence in Mumbai. 'We will change such laws when we come to power ... we will also ensure punishment of those who report false cases.' Rival politicians were quick to condemn his comments, and back the new law. In a statement the Indian National Congress said: 'We condemn Mulayam Singh's statement. There should be zero tolerance for rape and crime against women,' Other Backward Class (OBC) is a term used in India to describe castes or social groups which are educationally and socially disadvantaged, accounting for around 40 per cent of the population.

"By . Daniel Miller . A former high-flying police officer has told how her life spiraled into a hellish nightmare of drugs, prostitution and despair after she became hooked on ultra-addictive methamphetamine. Alison Moore was a rising star in the Maui Police department, regularly teaming up with DEA officers to fly helicopter missions searching for drugs or breaking down doors to bust big-time dealers. But every night she would return to her apartment, pull out a meth pipe and a bag of illegal drugs and smoke herself into delirium, a hopeless junkie in the grips of a deadly habit. Iced: Allison Moore, left,  when she was a promising young officer in the Maui Police Department and, right, at the time of her arrest after years of methamphetamine addiction . In a new tell-all book, Alison has revealed how her addiction got so bad she turned to prostitution and ended up lying to colleagues claiming she had ovarian cancer in order to explain her drug-ravaged her appearance. In a frank interview with the New York Post, Alison told how she first tried meth in her mid-20s after being given a small bag of the highly-addictive drug by a fellow officer in order to file a report on. Allison's new memoir Shards tells of her descent into drug addiction . She had just undergone an abortion after falling pregnant with twins following an affair with a married work colleague and was struggling with depression. She told the newspaper: 'I sat in my bedroom with the blinds drawn and stared at the baggy. I was so desperate for anything to make me feel better . . . and it would just be this one time. 'I poured out a few of the clear, tiny crystals, and even though you’re supposed to smoke it, I snorted it. I felt it burn in my nostrils and my eyes teared up. But then, I felt the most amazing, ecstatic high I’d ever felt. My life felt livable; I felt happy.' At first Alison tried to justify her drug use by buying her own supply and not stealing it from work. Because she was so well known as a vice cop in Maui, she would fly to Honolulu once a month and get a local prostitute to take her to a dealer. She would then walk through customs brazenly carrying the drugs in her pocket, knowing that as a police officer it would be unlikely she would be searched. After a matter of months, Alison had spent her entire $35,000 savings on plane tickets and meth - but by now she was addicted and began stealing drugs from work, skimming small amounts from seizures. In an attempt to cover up the devastating effect meth was having on her appearance she would wear contact lenses to hide her dilated pupils and binge on fast food and body-building supplements in a bid to keep her weight up. But her drug use was out of control. She was using around a gram a day, regularly sneaking off to the bathroom to take a hit before returning to her desk. Soon she had lost some 20 pounds and ended up lying to her colleagues, claiming she ovarian cancer. Now on sick leave she fell even further into the grip of the ultra -addictive methamphetamine. She moved in with her sister in Seattle, sitting in her bedroom smoking and injecting drugs with two young infants in the other room. Disgraced: Allison was jailed for a year after pleading guilty to 25 drug-related charges including deceiving the department, tampering with evidence, drug possession and forging doctors' notes . Soon she was turning to prostitution to feed her habit, scouring the Craigslist website to find men willing to trade drugs for sex. Incredibly no one suspected anything. Her work colleagues even got in contact to say they had donated their sick leave so she could have as much time as she needed to beat cancer. Referred to as ‘ice’ or ‘glass’, methylamphetamine can be consumed orally, sniffed, smoked or injected. In its most popular crystalline form it resembles glass shavings or a crystal rock but is also available in pills and powder. The drug is generally odourless although some forms have strong ammonia smell, because of solvents used to make it. At low doses crystal meth boosts alertness and blocks hunger and fatigue. Higher doses of the drug causes exhilaration and euphoria and very high doses cause agitation and paranoia. Side effects include anxiety, emotional swings, and paranoia and there is a risk of fever, convulsions, and falling into a coma. Death can result from burst blood vessels in the brain (triggered by spikes in blood pressure) or heart failure. The high from the drug tends to last 4-12 hours with users continuing to take the drug for days - sometimes addicts stay awake for days, eat very little and experience a heightened state of arousal. The drug was first synthesised in 1919 but has grown in popularity due . to the ease with which it is produced using a number of household . products and items. One of her closest workmates even organised a fund-raiser to pay for the chemotherapy she was supposedly having. But even that didn't stop her and she moved to Washington to stay with a dealer she had met on Craigslist. After discovering she was a police officer, the dealer secretly filmed her taking drugs and having sex and blackmailed her, confiscating her badge and drivers licence so she could not escape. She was regularly beaten and on one occasion after they had argued, he brought a group of men over to the house to gang-rape her. Eventually she managed to escape, getting her mother to come and collect her and going into rehab. Finally off the drugs she moved back in with her mother in New Mexico. But her past soon caught up with her and she was arrested and transported back to Maui in handcuffs and leg clamps to face 25 drug-related charges including deceiving the department, tampering with evidence, drug possession and forging doctors’ notes. She pleaded guilty to all charges and spent a year in jail. Now clean and living with her grandmother in Albuquerque, she works three jobs to make ends meet. She added: 'I still have meth cravings, even though I’ve been clean for four-and-a-half years. And I have nightmares about the dealer every single night. I see a therapist three times a week, three hours a visit. 'I try not to look too far ahead into the future, but my goal is to learn how to accept myself. My biggest regret besides hurting the people that I loved so much is that I didn’t love myself.'","Allison Moore was a high-flying officer in the Maui Police Department .

"By . Daniel Miller . Kim Dotcom, the founder of the file-sharing website Megaupload, is being sued by six major U.S. film studios who claim he 'facilitated, encouraged and profited from' copyright infringement on a massive scale. Twentieth Century Fox, Disney, Paramount Pictures, Universal Studios, . Columbia Pictures and Warner Bros, yesterday filed a lawsuit against the website which authorities allege cost film studios and record companies over $500million (£300m). Dotocom, 40, is already fighting a . bid by U.S. authorities to extradite him from New Zealand to face . online piracy charges over the Megaupload, which is said to have generated more than $175million (£105m). Scroll down for video . Lawsuit: Megaupload founder Kim Dotcom is being sued by several major U.S. film companies for 'massive copyright infringement' Megaupload, . which was closed in 2012, facilitated a 'massive . copyright infringement of movies and television shows,' according to a . statement issued by the Motion Picture Association of America yesterday. 'Megaupload wasn't a cloud storage service at all, it was an unlawful hub for mass distribution,' Steven Fabrizio, an attorney for the MPAA, said in the statement. The studios claim the website generated vast profits by encouraging paying users to store and share copyrighted material, such as movies and TV shows. In his defence, Dotcom claims Megaupload was merely an online warehouse and should not be held accountable if its stored content was obtained illegally. The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, said Dotcom and other defendants 'profited handsomely' by providing thousands of copyrighted works over the Internet to millions of Megaupload users without authorization or license. Defence: Dotcom claims Megaupload was merely an online warehouse and should not be held accountable if stored content was obtained illegally . Movies whose copyrights Megaupload infringed, according to the lawsuit, include Avatar, Forrest Gump and Transformers. Commenting on Twitter on Monday, Dotcom said U.S. authorities 'probably demanded' that the studios file the lawsuit 'because they initiated this ... Hollywood science fiction script of a case. Embarrassing.' The lawsuit is seeking unspecified damages as well as attorneys' fees. It claims the studios are entitled to Megaupload's profits and up to $150,000 per infringement. He is also known as Kim Schmitz and Kim Tim Jim Vestor, according to the lawsuit. Dotcom's U.S. attorney Ira Rothken said that Monday's suit was a way for the country's film industry to go after Megaupload if the U.S. Department of Justice fails to extradite Dotcom and his colleagues to the United States from New Zealand. An extradition hearing is scheduled for July. 'The MPAA is suddenly realizing that we're a few months away from the extradition hearing, and once Kim Dotcom and the others prevail in the extradition hearing they'll have more resources and more assets,' Rothken said. 'The MPAA wants to have cover if the Department of Justice fails in the extradition and the criminal case.' He predicted that the judge in the civil suit would likely stay the case pending the extradition hearing, adding that Megaupload will also seek access to evidence stored on its servers housed in Virginia to defend against the suit. Dotcom has been denied access to that evidence for the extradition hearing. Meanwhile, the legal storm has not stopped Dotcom, a German national with New Zealand residency, from delving into politics, launching a party last month to contest New Zealand's general election in September.","20th Century Fox, Disney, Paramount, Universal Studios, .

"By . Daniel Miller . Chicago Police failed to report a quarter of all victims of aggravated assault and aggravated battery in their 2012 crime statistics, the city's Inspector General has discovered. The force was found to have breached . state guidelines by only counting each attack as a single incident, when in fact they should have counted each victim. It means that all those attacks which resulted in multiple victims went under reported. Chicago Police failed to report a quarter of all victims of aggravated assaults and aggravated batteries in their 2012 crime statistics, the city's Inspector General has found . Inspector General Joe Ferguson looked at sample of 383 assault-related crimes, 72 of which resulted in a total of 95 victims, meaning that 23 victims, or 24 per cent, went unreported. The Inspector General's report read: 'CPD undercounted aggravated assaults and batteries on its I-UCR (Illinois Uniform Crime Reporting) submission by 24.2 per cent in a sample of incident reports examined by OIG. 'The undercount occurred because CPD based its crime count on the number of incident reports rather than the number of offenses against each victim, as required by the I-UCR Program. 'For example, if an incident resulted in three individual victims CPD would have counted this as one offense when, according to I-UCR, it should have counted it as three. ' While there is no suggestion that the department made the errors intentionally, it is a further blow for the city, which in 2012 year claimed the unenviable title of America's murder capital. A spokesman for the CPD said aggravated assaults and aggravated batteries had been recorded in that way for years. In their response, which was published at the bottom of the IG report, the department said it now intends to correct the figures, bringing them into line with Illinois state guidelines. Chicago was found to be the murder capital of America in 2012, with more reported crimes than New York, despite having only a third of the population . The statement read: 'Upon learning of the reporting issue, CPD immediately launched an in-depth review of every single aggravated assault and aggravated battery that occurred during 2012 and 2013, to correct the tracking of these crimes and bring the city into stricter adherence with reporting standards. 'This in-depth review is ongoing, and where errors in victim-level reporting exist, they will be corrected. 'As soon as CPD was made aware of this issue, remedies were immediately put in place to ensure even greater precision in the future.' In 2012 there were 500 murders in . Chicago up from 431 in 2011, according to FBI crime statistics, meaning . the city overtook New York for the first time, despite having a . population only a third of the size. As a result of the increase, the Inspector General also considered auditing the Police's homicide statistics to evaluate the possibility that some homicides may have been downgraded. But of the 6,260 total homicides reported, 6,241 were found to be non-negligent murders, with only 19 listed as involuntary manslaughter or reckless homicide. The Inspector General said they decided against an audit due to the small number of crimes categorized as involuntary manslaughter or reckless homicide in addition to a heightened public  scrutiny of the number of reported murders.","Chicago Police Department counted each attack as a single incident .

"By . Daniel Miller . Russian secret services have confirmed the killing of their 'most wanted' man, the Islamic terrorist leader and Chechen warlord Doku Umarov. Umarov, who was once dubbed 'Russia's Bin Laden', was 'neutralised' in a 'combat operation' which left dozens of terrorists dead, according to the country's Federal Security Service (FSB) announced. A . website sympathetic to the Islamic insurgency in the North Caucasus had reported that Umarov had been killed on . March 18, but Moscow had not . previously confirmed the report, until today. 'Most wanted': Russian secret services have confirmed the killing of Islamic terrorist leader Doku Umarov . Umarov, who had called for attacks on this year's Winter Olympics in Sochi, was the leader of the  Caucasus Emirate organisation which aims to establish an independent Islamic State in the region. The group, which is blamed attacks in Moscow in 2010 and 2011 that . killed a total of 77 people, is also listed as a terrorist organisation by the United . States. Alexander Bortnikov, the head of the FSB, told a meeting of Russia's . National Anti-Terrorism Committee: 'As . a result of a combat operation, the activity of the head of the . terrorist organisation Caucasus Emirate, Umarov, was neutralised,' Mr Bortnikov's comments were distributed in a video clip, one day after President . Vladimir Putin delivered a speech in which he said there must be no . let-up in the fight against . the militants. 'Neutralised': Moscow claims that Umarov was killed in a 'combat operation' that left dozens of insurgents dead . Atrocity: Umarov's Caucasus Emirate group claimed responsibility for the bomb that caused the November 2009 Nevsky Express train derailment  that left 27 dead . The group is also thought to have been behind three suicide bombings in the southern Russian city of Volgograd which killed 41 people in 2013, including this attack on a trolleybus . Umarov united . local militant groups in the North Caucasus under his command in 2007 . and led the violent struggle to create a caliphate in the patchwork of . mainly Muslim provinces sitting on Russia's southern border. Bortnikov . gave no details of the combat operation, however the state-funded RT news channel said dozens of . terrorists had been killed and hundreds of militants and their . supporters were detained. In . the first three months of 2014, Russia’s security services conducted 33 . counter-terrorist operations and have  eliminated 13 warlords and 65 . active members of the terrorist . underworld, with over 240 terrorists have been arrested, RT reported. The . death of Umarov is a breakthrough for Putin in the fight against the . Caucasus Emirate, although it already has appointed a new leader who identified himself as . Ali Abu Mukhammad in a video posted on You Tube. Putin . crushed a separatist rebellion in Chechnya when he first rose to power . 14 years ago but the insurgency has since spread to neighbouring . Dagestan. Jihadist: Umarov was blamed for suicide bombings in Volgograd (above) which killed 34 people at Christmas . Failed mission: Umarov had urged his fighters in a video posted online last July to use 'maximum force' to prevent Putin staging the Winter Olympics in Sochi, seen here during the closing ceremony . The Caucasus Emirate group said it was behind suicide bombings that killed . 37 people at a Moscow airport in 2011 and 40 on the Moscow subway in . 2010. The group is also . widely thought to have masterminded three deadly bombings that killed 41people in the . southern Russian city of Volgograd in as many months, before Russia . hosted the Winter Olympics in the Black Sea city of Sochi.

"By . Simon Tomlinson . A wife went into a blind panic when she opened a letter from the council that said her husband had died after he had nipped down the local for a pint. Bernadette Atkinson, 51, and the couple's son Karl arrived home to find the letter but no sign of her husband Anthony. Mr Atkinson, 52, had popped out for a swift drink only to return an hour later to find his wife in 'hysterics'. The letter, from the Chorley council tax department, read: 'Please accept my apologies for writing to you at this time, but we have received information that Mr Anthony Atkinson has sadly passed away.' 'In shock': Bernadette Atkinson (left) and her son Karl (right) opened a letter from the council saying that her husband Anthony (centre) had 'passed away' when he had actually just popped down the local for a pint . 'Nearly had heart attack': The letter from Chorley Council's tax department stating that Mr Atkinson had died which his wife found when she arrived home . It goes on to ask Mrs Atkinson to call a member of staff to 'provide further information'. Karl, 26, said: 'My mum nearly had a heart attack. My dad wasn’t in when we got home - he had gone out - and we were busy reading that my dad was dead. 'It turns out he went to the pub for a pint with his brother, but we didn’t know where he was and all of a sudden this letter was saying he had died. 'He had been in the house all day and so would have been in when the post arrived, but because it was addressed to my mum, he didn’t open it. 'My mum was in hysterics.' To their surprise, Anthony walked back through the family’s front door around 45 minutes later. 'My dad was understandably really angry,' said Karl. 'It was a bit of a strange situation, because he was reading a letter saying he wasn’t with us anymore.' Blunder: Mr and Mrs Atkinson are now seeking an apology from the council for the letter and want to find out who the information came from and why the letter was sent . Karl phoned the council and says he was told the information had come from the registrar, but when he contacted the register office, they could not find a record of his father’s death. After visiting the council offices, he claims he was given a different explanation. Karl, a bakery worker, said: 'The story changed to say a distraught family member had been in touch saying that my dad had died. 'I’m really angry. It’s really unprofessional of them.' To add insult to injury, Mr Atkinson was even reminded to pay the council tax during one phone call with the council. The family is now seeking an apology from the council for the letter and wants to find out who the information came from and why the letter was sent. Karl added: 'It seems nothing is happening. They haven’t told us whose fault it is or where they got the information from.' An investigation has been launched by Chorley Council. Gary Hall, Chief Executive of Chorley Council said: 'We have apologised unreservedly to Mr Atkinson and his family, both in person and by letter which has been accepted by them. 'I can understand the distress it must have caused them. 'We received the information in good faith and went through our usual checking process. 'However, there have obviously been some problems with it in this case and we are investigating what happened to make sure it doesn’t happen again.'","Bernadette Atkinson arrived home to letter but no sign of husband Anthony .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . A psychotic couple took two children hostage at knifepoint in their own home after a two-day alcohol and drugs binge. Michaela Brown and her boyfriend William Lawday barricaded themselves in to a bedroom with a ten-year-old girl and a boy aged 14 because they thought they were under attack from 80 soldiers. Both were let into the house by the children after banging on the doors and windows. Brown, 24, and Lawday, 30, had fled their own home believing they were in imminent danger after 48 hours of taking the former legal high M-Cat, alcohol and the anti-anxiety drug diazepam. Drug-induced psychosis: William Lawday (left) and his girlfriend Michaela Brown (right) held two children hostage in their own home during a two-binge on alcohol and the former legal high M-Cat . They both appeared at Hull Crown Court . for sentence after pleading guilty to two charges of false imprisonment of each of the two children. The . court heard Lawday ordered the children upstairs while wielding a . 12-inch knife and barricaded the bedroom door with a chest of draws, toy . box and TV set. The terrified girl was told to hide in a cupboard and at one point Lawday attempted to climb in as well. An . hour before the incident, Lawday and mother-of-two Brown had called the . police to their own home claiming men were banging around in their loft. A police officer searched the loft and found no one. He formed the belief the couple were suffering from a drug-induced psychosis and left. Brandished a knife: Lawday (above) and Brown barricaded themselves in to a bedroom with the girl, 10, and boy, 14, because they thought they were under attack from 80 soldiers and men with samurai swords . Prosecutor . James Byatt told the court the couple had arrived at a house on an . estate in Hull not realising the children were left home alone. The mother of the 10-year-old girl had . taken her two-year-old child to hospital, leaving her with a . 22-year-old babysitter and a 14-year-old friend. The 22-year-old had then left the pair home alone at around 4pm on February 25. Mr Byatt told the court: 'The Crown . says they were well under the influence of drugs and alcohol they held . these two children captive for an hour. Lawday had a knife. 'The children had heard banging on the windows with Lawday shouting: ""Let me in! Let me in!"" 'The boy said Lawday's pupils were dilated. He said the pair were both talking about guns and knives. 'Lawday had a knife up his sleeve and the boy described him as off his face. 'Both adults told the children to go upstairs and get in the spare room. 'Sinner': Lawday shows off his tattoo. The court heard he ordered the terrified girl to hide in a cupboard and at one point attempted to climb in as well . 'The boy said he did this because Lawday had a knife. The girl was crying, she said she was terrified. There were no verbal threats to the children.' He said Brown tried to use her mobile phone to call the police, but the battery had died. He added: 'She asked one of the children if they had a phone. 'The boy said there was one downstairs. He was told to get it. 'When he got back Lawday said there were 25 people in the loft. Then he said there were eight. He did not make much sense.' The 999 call was made and Lawday told a police operator four males where outside with Samurai swords trying to get in. He told the police he was in a room with children. Armed police took less than 10 minutes to arrive at the hostage scene. The boy went to the window and signalled to the police with a set of house keys from an upstairs window. The girl told the police: 'I was crying and very frightened.' The boy said: 'It was scary to see a large man with a knife, who was off his head on drugs.' Delusional: An hour before the hostage-taking, Lawday (pictured) and mother-of-two Brown had called the police to their own home claiming men were banging around in their loft . Both Brown and Lawday denied they were on drugs when interviewed by the police. Brown told a probation worker she had been on diazepam for two days. Lawday said he had drunk alcohol and taken M-Cat. The court was told that Lawday has 45 previous convictions, including burglary, assaulting police and possession of a knife. Brown has one conviction and a police caution. John Thackray, mitigating for Lawday, said: 'This is quite an extraordinary case. 'It demonstrates the consequences of people taking M-Cat. 'Lawday says he was shocked by his conduct on this occasion. He intended no real harm and at no time were the children in danger.' Brown has two children aged five and six who lived with her former partner, the court heard. Behind bars: Lawday (pictured) was jailed for a year, while Brown was handed a 10-month suspended prison term after each pleaded guilty to two counts of false imprisonment . Claire Holmes, for Brown, said: 'She is extremely remorseful. She is a mother and knows how the children must have felt.' Ms Holmes said a custody hearing was due to take place next week which, depending on the result of this case, could mean she would not see her children again until they are sixteen. She urged the judge not to jail her as she had recently suffered a miscarriage. Sentencing the pair, Recorder Graham Robinson said their drug taking had caused serious trauma to children. He said it had not been the fault of the young girl’s mother who had perfectly properly left her and the 14-year-old boy with a babysitter who had then betrayed her trust by leaving them home alone. 'It is perfectly plain what happened. Two young children got caught up in the middle of your drug-induced psychosis. 'The result of which led to them being imprisoned in their own home as you barricaded the door with them inside. 'The boy said he saw you, Lawday, passing the 12inch kitchen knife from one hand to the other. 'Both of them seem to have been utterly terrified. I accept that the balance of your both your minds was disturbed as a result of the various substances you had taken before you attended at their home. He jailed Lawday for 12 months because of his previous record and for possessing a knife. He gave Brown a 10-month suspended prison sentence with a requirement to attend a women's programme to help with her drug problem. She smiled as she walked free from court.","Michaela Brown and William Lawday took children hostage in own home .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . Farmed fish should be stunned before being killed because they deserve to be treated as humanely as cattle, the government's animal welfare body has said. The Farm Animal Welfare Committee (FAWC) said people working with Britain's 100million harvested fish must 'recognise that their killing requires taking responsibility for the ending of individual lives'. It argues that some species, including trout, have a 'sensory experience of pain' and that the public's perception that they don't need a high standard of welfare is based on ignorance, not science. Give them a 'life worth living': A government animal welfare committee is recommending that Britain's 100million farmed fish be stunned like cattle before slaughter because they deserve to be treated humanely . The group says the image of fish suffocating after being caught in the wild has become the 'norm' in people's minds. The report states: 'Society should provide farmed animals with ""a life worth living"" and an increasing number with ""a good life"". 'We affirm that these principles should extend to farmed fish. 'Both ""a life worth living"" and ""a good life"" encompass a whole life up to and including death.' 'Treat them like cattle': The body argues that some species, including trout, have a 'sensory experience of pain' and that the public's perception they don't need a high standard of welfare is based on ignorance . In a report to the government seen by The Times, the FAWC makes 16 recommendations, including stunning fish before slaughter because asphyxiation is not 'immediate' and has been shown to be 'stressful'. The British Trout Association told the paper that it supported the changes as long as regulatory controls took into account differences in the husbandry between aquatic and terrestrial animals. The Scottish Salmon Producers' Organisation said it believed it was already 'well ahead' of what any new legislation would require. Britain has around 750 fish farms which mostly breed salmon and rainbow trout. Scotland harvested some 35million salmon in 2012.","Fish farm workers should 'take responsibility for ending individual lives'

In a flap: Jon Ball from Wessex Bird of Prey Rescue captures an eagle after it flew into retired teacher Wendy Morrell's living room while she was watching television . Easy does it: Bird-of-prey expert John Ball spent 30 minutes coaxing the young eagle, called Storm, off its makeshift perch using a dead chick . Wendy Morrell had just settled down to watch the French Open tennis final when the 18ins tall bird of prey flew through open patio doors and into her lounge in Poole, Dorset. Wendy’s friend Karen Ruddlesden put on a winter jacket and gloves for protection and tried to lure the big bird down. When that failed, the pair placed pieces of ham outside in a bid to tempt it but with no joy. They then phoned a local bird of prey rescue centre and an expert spent 30 minutes coaxing the eagle eagle onto his glove using a dead chick. He then took the young eagle back to the rescue centre where he gave it some food. It was later reunited with its owner . and falconer James Moore who revealed the young bird was called Storm . and was being trained to ward off seagulls at a nearby landfill site. The eagle had been reported missing three days prior to turning up at Wendy’s . house after it was frightened by a loud bang and broke its tethers.

Flight and fright: Wendy's friend Karen Ruddlesden put on a winter jacket and gloves for protection and tried to lure the bird down and then put ham outside to tempt it outside, but with no joy . Wendy, a retired maths teacher aged in her 50s, said: 'We were about to watch the final of the French Open tennis when this big black thing swooped into the room. 'We have had small birds fly into the patio doors before and I thought it might have happened again but then Karen said ""it’s an eagle"". 'We couldn’t believe it. Initially there was total panic - our two dogs were in the front room and they both jumped to their feet and started barking. 'We took them into a bedroom and shut the door then went back into the lounge to get a proper look. 'There was the huge eagle, around 18 inches tall, sat on top of the wooden glass cabinet. 'It had knocked over a few ornaments and then started pecking away at a bowl of potpourri.

'They . came out quickly and thankfully they were able to get the eagle down . from the top of the cabinet without it damaging anything or getting . hurt.' Coaxing it down: The bird was reunited with its owner and falconer James Moore who revealed the young bird was called Storm and was being trained to ward off seagulls at a nearby landfill site . The Russian Steppe eagle - Aquila nipalensis in Latin - originate from Russia, Mongolia and Romania and winter in Africa and India. They can grow to 2.5ft tall with a wingspan of up to 7ft. They favour open dry habitats, such as the desert or steppes (grassland plains). They feed mostly on carrion, but will also hunt rodents and small mammals as well as small birds. Steppe eagles often prefer to scavenge and are known to steal food from other raptors. Like some other birds, they have a crop (thin-walled, expanding area) in their throats which enables them to store food for several hours before digesting them. Terri Hall, who runs Wessex Bird of Prey Rescue with her husband Jon, said: 'We got a call from a lady yesterday afternoon saying there was a bird of prey sat in her front room. 'We thought it might be a small bird like a sparrowhawk but when we got to her house there was this huge Russian Steppe eagle sat on a cabinet. 'Jon tempted the eagle down onto his glove with a dead chick and we took it back to the rescue centre where we gave it some food. 'Its owner came to pick it up and was very relieved to have it back again. 'He is training it to scare off seagulls at a landfill site where he works and it had broken its tethers after being frightened by a loud bang at the site.' Mr Moore said the eagle was recovering at his home after the ordeal. He said: 'He broke his tethers and flew off. I knew it was only a matter of time until he turned up somewhere but the question was where that would be. 'I'm very pleased to have him back safe and well. He is weathering out and relaxing at home now. 'I have spoken to Wendy and apologised for ruining her tennis match!' Mr Moore is a professional falconer who flies birds of prey at industrial sites to scare off seagulls. He said: 'I have owned Storm for three months now. He was rescued from his previous owners who had not cared for him very well. 'He was in a real state when he came to me but now he's 100 per cent better. 'I have eight falcons which I fly at sites to keep seagulls away and I decided to take Storm to work with me.

"By . Simon Tomlinson . A 92-year-old World War Two veteran has finally earned his wings - 69 years later. Great-grandfather Ralph Mayville joined an Canadian and U.S. paratrooper unit nicknamed the Black Devils yet never got the chance to jump during the conflict. He was given the American and Canadian military jump wings, but didn't feel he could wear them on his uniform because he had never performed a jump. Lifetime ambition: Marv Doney, a 2nd Commando Airborn Regiment veteran, pins jump wings on 92-year-old Ralph Mayville who has completed his first skydive after never getting the chance during World War Two . Sky's no longer the limit: The great-grandfather completes his first skydive nearly 70 years after the war ended. He joined an elite paratrooper unit yet never got the chance to jump during the conflict . Mr Mayville was a member of the elite First Special Service Force nicknamed the Black Devils. According to the First Special Service Force Living History Group, the unit 'received the most rigorous training schedule (under live fire) ever undertaken by an American Army unit'. This included 'intense training as paratroopers, ski troops, mountain fighters, demolition experts, amphibious forces and hand-to-hand combat experts.' The group, which was a joint U.S. and Canadian commando unit, formed in 1942 but disbanded two years later. But he can finally wear them with pride after completing his first skydive from 14,000ft almost 70 years after the war finished in 1945. He completed his jump at a skydiving school near Niagara Falls on Saturday. Ralph, from Windsor in Ontario, Canada, said: 'It's something I always wanted to do. It was fantastic - really beautiful.' During the jump, his family watched on - with some more nervous than Ralph. Granddaughter Louanne White said: 'I think he's crazy. He was a little too calm - I was more nervous.' Well-earned refreshment: Ralph enjoys a beer after his jump which he described as 'fantastic, really beautiful' Earlier this year, a 93-year-old war veteran completed a skydive after claiming his late wife told him to do something with his life in a dream. Confined to a wheelchair, Billy Hawes from Tiptree, Essex, had been housebound for four years. But after a message from his wife in the dream, the widower found a remarkable new lease of life. After building up the strength to walk again, Mr Hawes flew to South Africa to visit family and celebrated his transformation with an 11,000ft parachute jump.","Ralph Mayville, 92, was member of elite unit nicknamed the Black Devils .

"By . David Gardner . Baby boomers across America are moving back in to live with their parents – despite being in their 50s and early 60s. The number of older people going to live with their parents has risen at double the rate of their younger counterparts, according to a new report. The extraordinary turnabout by a generation generally reckoned to have had every opportunity to succeed comes in the wake of the great recession and the sluggish US economy’s slow pace of recovery. Baby boomers in America are moving back in to live with their parents - despite being in their 50s and early 60s . Driven by economic necessity, the older middle-aged have been forced to move back with their even older parents. For seven years through 2012, the number of Californians aged 50 to 64 who live in their parents' homes swelled 67.6 per cent to about 194,000, according to the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research and the Insight Center for Community Economic Development. The jump is almost exclusively the result of financial hardship caused by the recession rather than for other reasons, such as the need to care for aging parents, said Steven Wallace, a UCLA professor of public health who collated the data. ‘The numbers are pretty amazing,’ Professor Wallace told the Los Angeles Times. ‘It's an age group that you normally think of as pretty financially stable. They're mid-career. They may be thinking ahead toward retirement. They've got a nest egg going. And then all of a sudden you see this huge push back into their parents' homes.’ While many more young adults live with their parents – 1.6 million 18 to 29-year-old Californians returned to their childhood bedrooms – there has been a 33 per cent jump from 2006, half that of the 50 to 64 age group. The number of older people going to live with their parents has risen at double the rate of their younger counterparts, according to a new report . Most people in their 50s and older only move home as a last resort. Many have lost their jobs and can no longer afford the mortgage or soaring rents in areas like Los Angeles and San Francisco. Debbie Rohr, 52, moved back in with her 77-year-old mother in Salinas, California with her twin teenage sons after both she and her husband became unemployed at the same time. ‘I said 'Mom, I'm so sorry but I don't know what to do,'’ she told the Times. ‘I dreaded it. If it wasn't for my boys I wouldn't have done it. I would have lived in my car.’ Janine Rosales, 53, is back living with her mother in San Francisco. ‘I'm being treated like a child, being told when to turn off the lights and when to go to sleep,’ she said. Jenny Chung Mejia, a public policy consultant at the Insight Center for Community Economic Development in Los Angeles, said: ‘It's unexpected vulnerability at this point in your life. ‘When you're supposed to be the provider, sort of the rock for yourself and your family and maybe your parents, the table just gets turned on you and the rug gets pulled out from under you.’ ends .","Report: Number has risen at double the rate of their younger counterparts .

"By . David Gardner . A script for the last episode of popular TV show Downton Abbey was stolen after a hacker accessed the writer's email account. The cyber thief, known was 'Guccifer', apparently managed to download the script for the final episode of the fourth season of the ITV show after getting into Julian Fellowes' private email. It means the hacker, who has also targeted George W Bush and Watergate journalist Carl Bernstein, was in possession of the script six months before it was aired on television. Hacked: Writer Julian Fellowes' email account was hacked and the Downton series four finale script stolen . Over the last year, it has been reported the hacker is responsible for a number of high-level security breaches and has accessed email and Facebook accounts of senior US officials and senators. In February 2013, it was claimed the hacker was responsible for accessing the emails of Dorothy Bush Koch, sister of George W Bush, and releasing family photos. The Independent reports his British targets also include the former Attorney General, Baroness Scotland and the City financier Sir Francis Brooke. As well as Government officials, Guccifer has also managed to access Candace Bushnell's email and Twitter account and released the first 50 pages of the unpublished novel written by the Sex and the City author and also hacked comedian Steve Martin. Actor Rupert Everett, BBC broadcaster Jeremy Paxman and Sir Francis Brooke have also been hacked by the outlaw. Most of the victims were targeted after Guccifer managed to steal 900 contact names from journalist Tina Brown (left). As well as Lord Fellowes Baroness Scotland (right) other high-profile people were also hacked . It is believed most of the victims were targeted after Guccifer managed to steal 900 contact names from journalist Tina Brown who is the editor of The Daily Beast. By using publically-available information about his targets, the hacker guesses password security questions to gain access to email accounts. Using Wikipedia pages of prospective victims, he obtained the names of a target’s relatives, and even referred to a list containing the most popular names for dogs and cats. Website The Smoking Gun reported it has recently been handed documents that show Guccifer obtained private messages, photos and phone records as well as credit card and bank statements. The website says Guccifer didn’t offer a motive for his activities and handed over his archive of thousands of documents without revealing his identity ‘just in case I am busted.’ He has also got the mobile phone numbers of Hollywood star Robert Redford as well as email addresses for Nicole Kidman and Leonardo DiCaprio. The MailOnline has approached Lord Fellowes and Baroness Scotland for comment.

"By . David Gardner . Emotional: Katherine Jackson said Paris was particular traumatised by her son's death in 2009 . Michael Jackson’s three children went to visit their father’s body ten times in the morgue following his death, the singer’s mother revealed in her first TV interview yesterday. The star’s daughter, Paris – who tried to commit suicide earlier this year – was particularly traumatised by the tragedy. ‘She was screaming and crying when Michael died saying ‘I want to go with you daddy, I don’t want to live without you,’ said Katherine Jackson. Speaking days after what would have been the King of Pop’s 55th birthday on August 29, the 83-year-old Jackson family matriarch added: ‘I was feeling so bad for her. 'Paris suffered a lot after his death. She had to have pictures of Michael all over her room. Every picture that was hanging on the wall had to be of Michael.’ Mrs Jackson, who has 26 grandchildren and 11 great grandchildren, said all three children struggled to come to terms with their father’s sudden death in June 2009. ‘Michael’s kids went back to the morgue where Michael was about ten times. When I was in the room, I couldn’t go there,' she said, adding that she asked her daughter LaToya what the children were doing at the funeral home. ‘She said the children are all kissing and hugging Michael. Even though he is dead they are still doing that,’ she explained. The grandmother said Paris is doing ‘much better’ after cutting her wrists and swallowing an overdose of pills in her failed suicide attempt. The emotional interview was screened on the news show ’60 Minutes’ in Australia last night. Mrs Jackson, who was appointed guardian for Prince Michael, 16, Paris, 15 and 11-year-old Blanket after their father died, is currently suing concert promoters AEG Live in a wrongful death civil suit in Los Angeles. Scroll down for video . Grieving: (L - R) Prince Jackson, Blanket Jackson and Paris Jackson after  ceremony honoring their father in front of Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles . The Jackson’s claim the entertainment giant was negligent in hiring Conrad Murray, the private doctor now serving four years behind bars for causing Jackson’s death by giving him an overdose of the anaesthetic drug propofol. Mrs Jackson said it was ‘the worst day of my life’ when her son died. ‘I’ve never had that feeling before and I never want to feel like that again,’ she said. Mrs Jackson defended her son over claims that he abused drugs and tried to surgically change his appearance . Despite her advancing years, she rejects claims that she’s too old to care for her son’s children adequately, but admits to doing some things differently. ‘I didn’t like Michael’s children wearing masks in public so after his passing I never put any on them,’ she said. She said the vultures began circling soon after Jackson’s overdose. ‘People have been so greedy and have been taking things that don’t belong to them, and stealing things. All that happens when someone dies, especially when people think they have a lot of money,’ she added. And she insisted she always believed in her son’s innocence in the face of claims that he molested young boys. ‘I know that Michael didn’t do it,’ she said. ‘I have no doubt. ‘I didn’t ask him but we talked about it all the time. We talked about a lot of things.’ She said it made her ‘angry’ that Jackson made a multi-million pound pay-off to the family of Jordan Chandler, one of his accusers. Mrs Jackson also defended Jackson over claims that he abused drugs and tried to surgically change his appearance. ‘Michael was in a lot of pain so he was taking a lot of painkillers. Michael’s life changed when he was seriously burned doing the Pepsi commercial. 'It burned him so badly that his hair wouldn’t grow back at the top of his head and he didn’t like that part of it. That’s why he started wearing wigs,’ sher added. ‘People might think that Michael would over-indulge in plastic surgery but they don’t know what went on before. Michael also had a disease so the colour of his skin was changing. ‘I don’t know why people said he had too much facial surgery. He got his nose done so that being in the centre of his face would change how he looked but I don’t think he got too much done.’ She reminisced about how the singer refined some of his famous dance moves when he was still a child. ‘When he was a baby he used to dance to the sound of a washing machine. He used to dance to the rhythm of our old rickety washing machine so he started doing those rickety moves and dancing to the sounds,’ she said. ‘There will always be questions hanging in the air that I would like the answer to but I probably won’t get them,’ she said of the circumstances surrounding her son’s death.

"By . David Wilkes . It is among the most charming sights to be found in a British summer garden — birds fluttering down onto a bird bath. But who can really say they’ve ever had clear sight of a robin having a rinse, a woodpecker washing or a blue tit mid-dip? After all, it’s all over in seconds so the best most of us can hope for with the naked eye is just a glimpse of a blurry splash. Unless you happen to be Kim Taylor. For the eagle-eyed ex-government biologist spends up to eight hours a day taking these incredible images. He has designed and made specialist fast-aperture camera equipment which enables him to capture a photograph in a 15,000th of a second in his garden in Albury, Surrey.

It just gets you hooked.’ He can take only one picture every ten seconds, so patience is essential because the camera needs time to reset. Mr Taylor, 81, who hides behind a screen in his dining room to mask him from the birds’ view while he snaps away through a gap, said: ‘When they bathe, they shake their head in the water, throw water on their back and then flutter their wings. 'I like to watch young birds trying to bathe for the first time because they are never quite sure what they should do. They jump in and panic, before taking off.' Mr Taylor, who runs a specialist animal photography business called Warren Photographic, said: ‘When I started, I wanted to photograph animals in action, which required specialist flash equipment to freeze the motion of the subject. ‘You couldn’t do that with the normal equipment that was out there, so I designed and built some myself.’","Ex-government biologist Kim Taylor spends up to eight hours a day taking these incredible images in Albury, Surrey .

"By . David Gardner . North Korean leader Kim Jong Un may have executed his uncle because of his role as a procurer of a ‘pleasure brigade’ of young girls. Jang Song Thaek allegedly had the task of recruiting girls – some as young as 15 – for the country’s late dictator Kim Jong Il. According to a former family sushi chef, Kenji Fujimoto, North Korea’s 31-year-old leader was disgusted by his father’s immoral antics and has now punished his uncle for abusing his position. Fresh claims: The ruling family's former sushi chef has said North Korean leader Kim Jong Un (right) may have had his uncle Jang Song Thaek (left) executed because Jang helped procure young girls for his father . Mystery has surrounded the execution of Jang Song Thaek, who was the uncle of Kim Jong Il (pictured). This photo released by state media yesterday shows Kim inspecting Unit 534 of the Korean People's Army . Executed: Jang Song Thaek was paraded before a court as a 'traitor' before he was killed . Fujimoto claims Jang would insist on sleeping with the candidates himself before considering them for Kim’s ‘joy division’ – girls chosen to sing, dance and bathe the leader. Jang, who was put to death by his nephew last month, was married to Kim Jong Un’ s aunt, Kim Kyong Hui. ‘[Kim Jong Un] hates that kind of thing the most. His grandfather Kim Il Sung did similar things. His father also had quite a history with women. So having seen them, he wanted to prove that he’s different and that he would eradicate such practices, Fujimoto told NK News. ‘Mr Jang Song Thaek had relations with multiple women. Supreme Commander Kim Jong Un could not forgive this, so he executed Mr Jang Song Thaek, his caretaker and guardian,’ he added. He claimed Jang would audition the girls. ‘If they were singers, they would sing right there. There would be separate auditions for dancers. The panel would ask them to raise their legs and all that,’ he said. And to gain an audition they would have to spend the night with Jang, the chef claimed. Dynasty: Kim Jong Un (right) became North Korea's supreme leader in 2011 after the death of his father (left) Kim Jong Il (right) and his son (left) began appearing in public as Kim Jong Un was groomed for power . Western tastes: Kim Jong Il was said to enjoy French wines, McDonald's hamburgers and Hollywood films . Up until now, mystery has shrouded the North Korean leader’s motives for putting his mentor to death. Some experts have questioned the reliability of the Japanese chef, who worked for the Kim family between 1989 and 2001. He claimed Kim Jong Il had a taste for live fish and expensive French wines and brandies. On one occasion, he claimed, he was sent to China to bring back some McDonald’s hamburgers. Bradley K. Martin, author of ‘Under the Loving Care of the Fatherly Leader: North Korea and the Kim Dynasty’, was quoted yesterday as saying that none of his research suggested Jang was in charge of recruiting young girls. Fujimoto’s credibility was helped by his prediction that Kim Jong Un and not his brother Kim Jong Nam would be appointed to succeed their father in 2011. The chef fled North Korea in 2001 but was invited back for a visit by the current leader in 2012 and was photographed embracing Kim Jong Un. His wife and daughter still live in Pyongyang.","Claim made by the North Korean ruling family's former sushi chef .

"By . David Wilkes . A 93-year-old war hero was ‘stripped of his dignity’ and left to die in agony by staff at an NHS hospital, his family claim. Frank Foster’s anguished screams were ignored by nurses, who left him face down on a urine-soaked bed, they say. Mr Foster’s daughter Joanne Fowler ended up sleeping at his side on the ward at Tunbridge Wells Hospital, Kent, because she was so worried staff were not doing anything to ease the pain as he suffered a fatal brain tumour. WARNING GRAPHIC IMAGES BELOW . Frank Foster, 93, is pictured lying naked on his soaked hospital bed just six days before he died . Mr Foster, who served as a soldier in the Second World War, pictured in hospital before his health deteriorated . Mrs Fowler, 57, whose father fought in the Second World War and still had shrapnel in his shoulder from being shot at El Alamein in 1942, said: ‘He would have suffered less in battle than he did at that hospital at the hands of nurses who ignored his cries for help. ‘It would have been better if he’d died in the war. If I had known a fraction of what my father was about to suffer in hospital, without a doubt I would have killed him with my own hands.’ She has released harrowing photographs she took of her father, who was deaf and blind, after making an official complaint about his care. Mrs Fowler added: ‘It was the most horrific thing. He was screaming in pain and the nurses wouldn’t do anything. He was visibly distressed and was tearing his clothes off because he was in so much agony ... when he died it was a relief to us all.’ Mrs Fowler, a self-employed designer, recorded his cries, as well as a nurse threatening to ask her to leave after she complained. The hospital has launched an investigation. His daughter Joanne Fowler was so appalled by the treatment of her father that she took the pictures . Former soldier Mr Foster, from Tunbridge Wells, served with the King’s Royal Rifle Corps and 2 Queen Victoria’s Rifles (Territorial). He suffered his shoulder wound when he was shot from behind at El Alamein in North Africa, where in 1942 two battles were won which helped change the course of the war. After returning home, he became an accountant and married his wife Jean in 1952. They went on to have five children, four grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren. Mr Foster went into hospital on May 22 for ongoing care for a brain tumour and was admitted to a ward the next day. Mrs Fowler said she begged the nurses for pain relief for her father but his buzzer was ignored ‘constantly’ and a doctor was only called after she pleaded with staff for four hours. She also claimed that at one point  a nurse came in and ‘angrily squirted’ some pain relief into his mouth with a syringe, without saying anything. In one of her recordings, a nurse apparently threatens to have Mrs Fowler removed from the hospital after she asks how much pain her father will be forced to endure. Frank Foster (pictured lying in pain in his hospital bed) died six days after he was admitted to hospital . He can be heard crying out in agony in the clip, while his daughter says: ‘My dad is in the most horrendous pain and this shouldn’t  be happening. ‘Imagine the worst pain imaginable and that is what my dad is going through right now.’ The nurse then replies: ‘I will have you removed. What would you like me to do?’ Mrs Fowler claims she had previously found her father in a toilet covered in dried faeces after being left alone by staff, and that relatives had to clean him up themselves when he wet himself in distress. Pictured with his family, Mr Foster (blue shirt) was battling a fatal brain tumour when he was admitted to hospital . Mr Foster pictured (left) with fellow soldiers in WWII and on his wedding day (right) to wife Jean in 1952 . Fought in the deserts of North Africa, there were two Battles of El Alamein in Egypt in 1942. The first attempt stalled the Axis advance into Egypt with the second was hailed as a major turning point in the Second World War. Axis and Allied forces had chased each other . over the desert for three years. The tide turned in the Allies' favour . at the Second Battle. British General Montgomery . spent months building up an overwhelming advantage in men and armour, . before launching his attacks against Field Marshal Rommel's German and . Italian troops. It led to the retreat of the Afrika Corps and the German surrender in North Africa in May 1943. Mr Foster died on June 13, six days after his daughter found him naked, face down on his bed. He is survived by his wife, 83. A spokesman for Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust, which runs the hospital, said: 'We are very sorry that Mrs Fowler felt her experience of her late father’s care did not meet the high standards of care, comfort and dignity we are committed to providing our patients at all times. 'We are taking these allegations extremely seriously and have commissioned a full independent review of Mr Foster’s care to establish the facts, provide assurance and will not hesitate to take any actions found necessary. 'We have spoken to and are meeting with Mrs Fowler to discuss her concerns in detail as part of this process. 'We cannot discuss individual areas of Mr Foster’s care while the investigation establishes exactly what happened. We monitor individual aspects of every patient’s care and pain relief is administered carefully and according to individual clinical needs. 'Our absolute priority is to provide the best possible care to all of our patients at all times.' His relatives have also complained about Firtree House Care Home in Tunbridge Wells, where Mr Foster spent a week between hospital stays in May, because his call button did not work. The home confirmed it had ‘experienced technical problems with some of its call buttons’ during Mr Foster’s stay, but has since resolved the issue. Tunbridge Wells Hospital in Kent has since launched an internal investigation into the care of Mr Foster .","WARNING: CONTAINS GRAPHIC IMAGES .

'He’s definitely our Pride baby,' Mr Nelson told Today.com, adding, 'We’re so proud of him. That picture, to us, represents what pride is all about and how far the LGBT community has come. Love is love, and that’s what pride is all about.' Proud papas: First-time fathers BJ Barone and Frankie Nelson were shirtless for the birth of son Milo because they believe skin-to-skin contact will be beneficial to the baby . Ms Foster photographed Milo's birth as a gift to the couple’s surrogate, Kathy Frenette. 'She absolutely captured the most beautiful moment,' Nelson told Today.com of Ms Foster's pictures. 'I was completely overwhelmed. I was so scared of dropping the baby. Mostly, the feeling was of joy and love and amazement.' Barone added: 'I was so excited, so overjoyed, so overcome with emotion, it was an incredible moment I will never forget.

'They . are two compassionate people who felt all the emotions that every new . parent feels,’ Ms Foster explained on the Facebook page for Lindsay Foster Photography. 'She did not use her own eggs and she was very happy to have given this . gift,' Ms Foster explained. 'The fact we have this photo, it’s a reminder of how much love we have for him' Ms Foster said that she spent hours with the two fathers and they were well-prepared for the birth, but that did nothing to lessen their excitement and anxiety. 'They asked all appropriate questions of the birthing . mom and the midwife and educated themselves as best as they could for . their son’s arrival,' she said. She also revealed that Mr Nelson and his partner were shirtless for the birth because skin-to-skin contact is reported to be beneficial to newborns.

It is not known how long Miss Rosenberg, who was educated at the $48,000-a-year Marlborough College, the same school as the Middletons, has been dating Brin. An unnamed source told the New York Post Brin and his wife were 'still together when Amanda entered the picture'. It is possible the relationship violated Google's company code. Google gossip: Amanda Rosenberg is the . 27-year-old British woman who has struck up a romance with billionaire Google co-founder Sergey Brin . An online version of the code states: 'Romantic relationships between . co-workers can, depending on the work roles and respective positions of . the co-workers involved, create an actual or apparent conflict of . interest'. It added: 'If . a romantic relationship does create an actual or apparent conflict, it . may require changes to work arrangements or even the termination of . employment of either or both individuals involved.' Google goes on to offer a self-test to help employees decide if their relationship could cause a problem. 'When faced with a potential conflict of . interest, ask yourself: would this activity harm my reputation, . negatively impact my ability to do my job at Google or potentially harm . Google? 'Would this activity embarrass Google or me . if it showed up on the front page of a newspaper or a blog?  If . the answer to any of these questions is ""yes"", the relationship or . situation is likely to create a conflict of interest and you should . avoid it.' Brin is not the first Google executive Miss Rosenberg has been linked to since she transferred to the San Francisco offices last year. She was linked to Hugo Barra, who resigned this week to take a job with Android phone maker Xiaomi in China. His departure comes after 'a recent thorny personal situation related to the end of a romantic relationship he had with another Googler,' the New York Post reported. 'Relationships between senior executives and more-junior employees raise myriad concerns,' James McRitchie, publisher of Corporate Governance, said. 'Dating a subordinate is generally a bad idea, from the company's perspective,' he told Yahoo Finance, adding that it had the potential to damage morale or violate confidentiality. Should Brin and his wife divorce, Californian law suggests their . massive fortune would have to be halved – although they reportedly . signed a strict pre-nuptial agreement. While the internet was agog . with talk of Brin romancing his much younger employee, the Daily Mail . tracked down a distinctly unsurprised former boyfriend of Miss Rosenberg . – who said she ‘knew the power of her womanly ways’. Ewan Butler, . 28, a trainee teacher living with his parents in Darlington, said: . ‘Amanda’s a good looking girl, and she knows she is.' A good looking girl...

She won her role promoting the controversial spectacles after coming up with the voice command ‘Ok, Glass’ to . activate them . Connected but no longer together: Brin and his estranged wife are bound together by business dealings - he is an investor in her DNA company 23andMe - and the children they share. Power couple: If Brin and Wojcicki, his wife of six years, divorce, Californian law suggests their . massive fortune would have to be halved - although they reportedly . signed a strict pre-nuptial agreement . Marriage on the rocks: A Google spokesman confirmed that Brin – one of the . world’s richest men – has for several months . been living apart from Wojcicki, the mother . of his two children . 'And she’s good at . “playing” men – she played me.’ Brin’s relationship with Miss Rosenberg . emerged only yesterday – but the pair were pictured together earlier . this year at a New York Fashion Week event, both wearing the . controversial Google Glass computerised spectacles for which she is . marketing manager. An employee of Google since she graduated with a . communications degree from Leeds University, she initially worked for . the internet giant in London before last year moving to San Francisco to . work at its Silicon Valley nerve centre. She soon won a role . promoting Google Glass, widely criticised as the glasses which enable . users to film and broadcast over the internet everything they see . non-stop, worrying privacy campaigners. Miss Rosenberg wrote an . online blog soon after she arrived – describing herself as a . ‘misanthropic Brit struggling to come to terms with Californian . optimism’. She wrote: ‘I’d been living a beautifully choreographed . life in London for pretty much my entire life; family, friends, job, . life. Then one day I realised the beauty had faded. ‘So I applied for a transfer with my company to a different country. Yes! The romance of a transfer! ‘Luckily for me this all worked out like I dreamed it would...NOT. Of course it didn’t work out like that! ‘I . remember having conversations with people about moving countries, and . no one talks about how it felt to be alone. 'I wanted to grab them and . scream “Why are you not telling me about how you ate lunch in the . toilets at work for the first week because no one talked to you?”.’ Miss . Rosenberg also wrote that she was initially so . shy she failed to turn up at her first work drinks invitation, fearing . she would be ‘the weird loner in the corner’, so stayed in eating . biscuits alone on her sofa instead. In an internet profile Miss . Rosenberg wrote of herself: ‘I’m part of the master race that is the . Chinese Jew or Chew, if you will. 'Born in Hong Kong but bred in the UK. A . misanthrope who’s bad at maths, so I got the worst of both worlds.’ More than a marketing manager: Miss Rosenberg also appears in promotional shots for Google Glass .

"By . David Gardner . The Jackson family is at war over the medical treatment of Michael’s daughter Paris following her suicide attempt. The 15-year-old girl is still in a psychiatric hospital nearly three months after taking a drug overdose. Her uncle Randy, 51, declared on Twitter: ‘She is not psychotic. Drug overdose: Paris Jackson (left) was already spotted with cut marks on her arm back in April before her suicide attempt three months ago, but her uncle Randy Jackson (right) insists she is not psychotic . ‘There is no reason for her to be in a psychiatric hospital this long away from her family.’ Randy, Michael’s younger brother, tweeted that his niece had been in the facility for ‘far too long’ and said he hated the fact that she would probably still be away for her father’s birthday on August 29. ‘There’s something more to this there’s something going on I don’t like it I’m afraid for her,’ he wrote in a separate note. Paris’s mother Debbie Rowe last night claimed Randy didn’t know what he was talking about. ‘As usual, he’s grossly misinformed,’ she is reported saying. ‘He doesn’t know what he’s talking about. He has no idea where she is. She’s not in a psychiatric hospital.’ Randy assured his Twitter followers that he would ‘look into this’. But he doesn’t have any official say in the teenager’s care and neither does Miss Rowe. Michael’s . mother, Katherine, 83, and nephew, TJ Jackson, are the guardians of . Paris and her brothers Prince, 16, and Blanket, 11. The family is . keeping the Los Angeles area facility where Paris is being treated a . secret. 'Grossly misinformed': Paris's mother Debbie Rowe says Randy Jackson has no idea about her daughter's state of health . She slit a wrist and took an overdose of painkillers on June 5. After she was hospitalised, Kevin Boyle, a lawyer for her grandmother, said: ‘Being a sensitive 15-year-old is difficult no matter who you are. It is especially difficult when you lose the person closest to you. Paris is physically fine and is getting appropriate medical attention.’ A week ago, Miss Rowe testified on the effect that Michael Jackson’s death in June 2009 had had on Paris. Miss Rowe, mother of Michael’s two older children, was speaking at the Jackson wrongful death trial. Michael’s family are suing AEG Live, the promoter of his doomed comeback concerts, for £26.5billion. They claim AEG was negligent in hiring Conrad Murray, the star’s personal doctor. Miss Rowe broke down in the witness box, saying: ‘Their father is dead. I almost lost my daughter! ‘She is devastated. She tried to kill herself. She doesn’t feel she has a life any more.’ The trial, which is not expected to finish until next month, is said to have put added strain on Paris. Murray is now serving a four-year sentence for involuntarily manslaughter over the singer’s death.","Michael Jackson's daughter took drug overdose and cut herself .

"By . Erin Clements . A quadriplegic father made his daughter’s wedding day this weekend when he walked her down the aisle. Augie Nieto, 56, who was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative disease, nearly a decade ago, was on hand to give away his youngest daughter, Lindsay, in Rancho Palos Verdes, California, Saturday. Mr Nieto was diagnosed with the disease in 2005, and lost the use of his arms and legs within three years. A few years ago, he underwent a tracheotomy that left him unable to speak. Father of the bride: Augie Nieto, 56, walks his daughter Lindsay down the aisle, 10 years after being diagnosed with ALS . Important cause: Mr Nieto created Augie's Quest, which has raised nearly $40 million for ALS research since 2006 . Lindsay, who was marrying Chris Williams, 28, said it meant a lot to have her father's blessing. 'I kind of thought that I would've . been looking at Chris when I was walking down the aisle with Augie, but I . couldn't look at anything but my dad,' Lindsay, 25, told TODAY.com. 'I was just amazed he was able to get in his device and stand up. The sun was in his eyes, and I was just thinking that he's done so much to be here and worked so hard that I just started bawling,' she added. Moving moment: Mr Nieto was able to mouth 'I love you, and I'm so proud of you' to Lindsay . Guest of honor: 'I couldn't look at anything but my dad,' Lindsay, 25, said . Mr Nieto, who can still move his facial . muscles, was able to mouth 'I love you, and I'm so proud of you' to . Lindsay during the ceremony. ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, . is a neurological disease that attacks the nerve cells responsible for . controlling voluntary muscles. According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, most people with ALS die from respiratory failure, often within three to five years from the onset of  symptoms, and only about 10per cent survive for 10 or more years. Proud Papa: Mr Nieto accompanies his daughter down the aisle . Member of the wedding: Mr Nieto was harnessed to aluminum scaffolding that kept him upright during the ceremony . Step by step: 'I was just amazed he was able to get in his device and stand up,' Lindsay said .

"By . David Wilkes . The once graceful bird’s agonised wheezing heard by rescuers as he struggled to keep afloat could so easily have been a tragic swansong. But somehow, despite being shot in the skull and through the windpipe with a crossbow by mindless thugs leaving him barely able to breath, the traumatised swan was still clinging to life when the RSPCA officers arrived. Incredibly, after undergoing an emergency operation and making a miracle recovery in just three weeks, he was then declared fit enough to be reunited with his mate. This male swan was shot with two crossbow bolts, but miraculously made a full recovery . The traumatised swan was still clinging to life when the RSPCA officers arrived after a passer-by heard his wheezing . The bird was shot in the skull and through the windpipe with a crossbow by mindless thugs leaving him barely able to breath . In a poignant illustration of swans’ fabled habit of mating for life, she had refused to leave the stretch of canal where the horrific attack happened - and was there waiting faithfully for him as his saviours fought back tears at their reunion. RSPCA veterinary officer Beverley Panto, who cared for the cob or male swan at the charity’s Stapeley Grange Wildlife Hospital, in Nantwich, Cheshire, said: ‘It was a day we thought would never come. 'His injuries were absolutely horrendous and it was touch and go if he’d survive.’ A walker alerted the RSPCA to the swan’s plight after spotting him on the canal at Penketh on June 18. One of the steel crossbow bolts had pierced his skull, missing his brain by millimetres. The other went into his neck, through his windpipe and out the other side. Police are still seeking the swan¿s attackers. Swans are a protected species and, according to ancient law, all owned by the Queen . Both were still lodged in the swan, but he was still just about swimming on the water when the rescuers got to him. They managed to get the traumatised animal to the bank with the aid of a swan hook, a specialist tool similar to a shepherd’s crook. From there he was rushed to vet Alan Humphreys who carried out an emergency operation to remove the bolts and insert a tube into the side of the swan’s body. This meant he could breathe via the air sac system which forms part of birds’ respiratory system. After a night under close observation at the Liverpool vet’s, he was transferred to the RSPCA hospital. Miss Panto said: ‘He was still in a lot of pain and distress and struggling to breathe when he came into us. He was at this point breathing through a tube in his side so we were really lucky that birds have an air sac system – these sort of balloons that are extensions of their lungs – so he could breathe while bypassing his injuries and the windpipe. ‘We gave him pain relief, anti-biotics and fluids. We weren’t sure if he was going to make it and there were a few worrying times when he lost weight and we were worried about swelling in his brain. 'But he rallied and pulled through. It’s incredible that he’s still with us.’ An endoscopy last week showed his windpipe was healing. The tube was removed from his side and to everyone’s relief he could breather normally again. Incredibly, after undergoing an emergency operation and making a miracle recovery in just three weeks, he was then declared fit enough to be reunited with his mate . After a few days interacting with other swans on a pond at the hospital, it was decided he was ready to be returned to the wild. Staff took him to the site in a carry cage before releasing him there on Tuesday. Lee Stewart, the hospital’s manager, said: ‘Swans are difficult to relocate and as his mate was waiting for him we decided it was best to put him back where he came from. ‘We didn’t want to split the pair up and we couldn’t move his mate somewhere else as we need veterinary grounds to lift any animal and there were none for her as she was uninjured.’ Locals have nicknamed the male swan Sidney and, along with members of an angling club, are helping to keep an eye on the pair and make sure there are no further attacks. Staff at the rescue centre took him to the canal in a carry cage before releasing him back into the wild . Mr Stewart said: ‘When he was released, his mate was very excited and was displaying by arching her wings. He swam past her at first, like he was playing hard to get. Then he turned back and went to her. It was a beautiful moment.’ Police are still seeking the swan’s attackers. Swans are a protected species and, according to ancient law, all owned by the Queen. Killing or injuring them used to be classed as treason, but now those who do so face maximum sentences of a fine of up to £20,000 or six months jail under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. Mr Stewart said: ‘This is one of the worst cases I’ve ever seen. I cannot understand the mentality of whoever did this to an innocent bird. It’s really sick and whoever did it needs help.’","The swan was attacked by thugs along canal in Penketh, Cheshire .

"By . David Wilkes . Glaring menacingly from the window, a wild cat looks down on shaken pensioner Bruce Gough after going ‘berserk’ and attacking him in his home. The tortoiseshell terror flew into a rage when Mr Gough, 74, tried to eject it with a broom after it had sneaked in through an open window. It bit and scratched him, leaving him needing a tetanus injection at hospital, then raced around, smashing a treasured antique in its frenzy, before climbing up the curtains and refusing to leave. An elderly couple have been left shaken after a wild cat broke into their home, attacked them and smashed valuable antiques - before refusing to leave . The tortoiseshell terror flew into a rage when Brian Gough, 74, tried to eject it with a broom after it had sneaked in through an open window . In desperation, Mr Gough and his wife Eileen, 77, shut it in the bedroom as they struggled to find a way to rid themselves of the feline intruder and avoid further catastrophe. They called the RSPCA, but to their dismay the charity refused help because the demonic moggy was believed to be feral. So, as their ordeal entered a second day, there it stayed, hissing… and probably thinking it had got the better of them. But the creature had not reckoned on the intervention of neighbour Andrew Fox, 58, who came to the rescue - dressed in full motorcycle leathers to protect him from its teeth and claws. After a brief chase Mr Fox managed to catch the animal before releasing it back outside, ending its 48 hour reign of fear in the flat in Chartham, Kent. Retired aerospace engineer Mr Gough told how the drama began as he and his wife were watching television last Thursday. He said: ‘I suddenly saw the cat standing in the doorway. It must have got in through a bedroom window. They called the RSPCA, but to their dismay the charity refused help because the demonic moggy was believed to be feral . ‘When I got up, it dashed off into a spare bedroom and I found it hiding under the bed. I tried to coax it out but it wouldn’t budge, so I got a broom to ease it out. ‘But when I went to pick it up, it just flew at me and sank its teeth and claws into my forearm. ‘It was going berserk and flew around the room, knocking things over, including a Victorian ewer on the mantelpiece, which smashed.’ Retired nurse Mrs Gough said: ‘Unfortunately, the cat defecated and urinated in the room, which now stinks. ‘We shut the door and left it in there. Bruce’s arm was bleeding quite badly and I said he should go to hospital because there was a risk of infection. ‘The cat had clawed its way up curtains and sat on the edge of the sash window, and that’s where it was the following morning.’ It bit and scratched Mr Gough, leaving him needing a tetanus injection at hospital, then raced around, before climbing up the curtains and refusing to leave. But a motorbike-leather clad neigbour soon came to the couple's rescue and removed the cat . After the RSPCA said it could not help, the couple were instead given a cage trap by Canterbury Cats Protection in the hope they could tempt the cat down and catch it. But instead they had to turn to Mr Fox and his unorthodox, but effective, ‘cat-proof’ suit. Mrs Gough said: ‘I was very surprised and a little angry the RSPCA wouldn’t help.’ Yesterday an RSPCA spokesman said: ‘This sounds like a very distressing incident for this couple. ‘The RSPCA is an animal welfare charity and our donors expect us to use our limited resources on animals who are suffering or in distress or danger. So long as a feral cat is healthy, he or she will live happily outside and so when we are busy we have to prioritise other animals who are in greater need of our help. ‘We would advise anyone who finds a feral cat has entered their home to keep a distance and ensure they have a clear and easy exit route - such as an open window or door - so they can make their own way out. The likelihood is a cat like this will be very scared to be shut in an alien environment and pleased to find a way out. ‘We support the trapping and neutering of feral cats where local charities have the capacity to do so.’","Wild cat held pensioners Bruce and Eileen Gough hostage in their home .

"By . David Wilkes . With the last of her A-level exams looming, grammar school girl Saskia Fisk was revising hard. So when two friends asked her to watch a motor race at Brands Hatch with them it seemed the perfect opportunity for some well-earned relaxation. But a pleasant day out turned into a terrifying nightmare for the 18-year-old after one of her companions, Jack Cottle, drove her car on to the track during the race as she sat in the front passenger seat. Scroll down for video . Ordeal: Terrified Saskia Fisk, 18, from Sevenoaks, Kent, was driven around . Brands Hatch in her VW Polo by two reckless men who caused a motor race . to be abandoned . The other friend, 20-year-old Zac Copson, videoed events on his mobile phone from the back seat as Miss Fisk screamed at Mr Cottle to stop. He pulled off the track after 90 seconds, but the race had to be abandoned. The video was posted on social networking sites and Mr Cottle, 21, was arrested on suspicion of false imprisonment, having told a newspaper that ‘Saskia was well up for it’. Yesterday she rebutted the men’s claim that ‘she was egging us on’. She had set off in her white VW Polo 1.2 to the track near West Kingsdown, Kent, a 20-minute drive from her family’s £625,000 detached home in Sevenoaks, after asking her parents’ permission. Her frightening experience began 90 minutes into the four-hour endurance race for VW Beetles last Saturday. She told the Daily Mail: ‘We were . sitting in the car watching the race and they got bored and said . wouldn’t it be funny if we raced round the track. I was like, “Yeah, . it’d be really funny”. But I didn’t think they’d do it. Even when we . were in the paddock I was saying stop. I begged him to stop. ‘I’m angry they’re saying I was egging them on. I was panicking and screaming. I was praying he would stop on the pit lane.’ Jack Cottle, 21, pictured left, allegedly drove Miss Fisk's car onto the racetrack while Zac Copson, 20, pictured right, apparently videoed the events on his mobile phone from the back seat . Boy racer: The white Polo which was driven onto the track during the race at Brands Hatch . Unbeknown to the men, Miss Fisk suffers from postural tachycardia syndrome which affects blood pressure. She said medics at the track had to calm her down. Miss Fisk, who has 12 GCSEs, now fears her plans to go to university and become a forensic psychologist may have been ruined because the incident left her struggling to concentrate during her sociology A-level on Monday. The talented singer, who has auditioned for the next series of The X Factor, said she has known the men, both labourers, for about three months and dismissed reports she was dating Mr Cottle. ‘I won’t be seeing either again,’ she added. Mr Cottle, of Tonbridge, Kent, was arrested on Monday and released on bail until July 24 pending further inquiries. Jonathan Palmer, of track owner MSV, said the British Racing and Sports Car Club ran the event and controlled circuit access from the pit lane. He added: ‘We will be reviewing security procedures.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Saskia Fisk was invited to watch motor race at Brands Hatch with friends .

"By . David Wilkes . He arrived at the British Museum in 1835 in a woman's coffin, wearing a pink skirt and appeared to have breasts. So, not surprisingly, perhaps, for decades experts there described the Egyptian mummy in their guide books as the preserved remains of a 'dancing woman'. There was the itchy question of why the embalmer had drawn a beard on 'her' face, but it was not until the 1960s when the body was X-rayed that questions over its gender began to be seriously raised. Scroll down to see video. For decades experts there described the Egyptian mummy in their guide books as the preserved remains of a 'dancing woman'. Now they've discovered the embalmed body is actually a man . Now, thanks to a hospital CT scanner, it has finally been confirmed that the mummy is, in fact, that of an adult male... and his decolletage was the result of a couple of strategically placed bundles of cloth. Similar padding had also been applied to plump out his thighs. Scholars think both areas may have been specially padded because the man was fat and the embalmer was trying to recreate accurately his appearance during life. The tests also established that he was at least 20 years old, 5ft 6in tall, had lost five teeth - and would have suffered terrible pain from several dental abscesses. The mummy was originally part of a collection of Egyptian antiquities amassed by Henry Salt, British Consul General in Egypt, in the 1820s. He is one of eight mummies to be virtually unwrapped in the museum's Ancient Lives, New Discoveries exhibition . Neil MacGregor, director of the British Museum, said: 'This new technology is truly ground-breaking, allowing us to reconstruct and understand the lives of these individuals' The 'electronic excavation' of the man, thought to date from the 2nd century AD when Egypt was under Roman rule, forms part of a new exhibition opening at the museum in central London tomorrow. An interactive visualisation shows him being gradually unwrapped. Yesterday John Taylor, curator of the British Museum's department of Ancient Egypt and the Sudan, said: 'There was a deliberate attempt to create his appearance and it may be that it was done because he was overweight. Thanks to a hospital CT scanner, it has finally been confirmed that the mummy is, in fact, that of an adult male . 'It is a highly unusual mummy altogether, with the arms, legs fingers and toes separately wrapped rather than the whole body being cocoooned in material. There are only a handful of other mummies like him in the world. 'He also has a leather belt and several linen straps on his body. They are some sort of decoration but we don't know what they symbolise. Some depictions of Egyptian dancers show them wearing similar straps so he may have been a dancer after all.' The mummy was originally part of a collection of Egyptian antiquities amassed by Henry Salt, British Consul General in Egypt, in the 1820s. It is thought it was originally from a tomb in Thebes, but there are no documents to confirm this. When the British Museum bought the mummy at an auction records do, however, show he had a short skirt or kilt around the waist which was once pink, although the colouring has now almost disappeared, and he was in a wooden coffin marked with the woman's name Mutemmenu. The coffin has been dated to 1300-1200BC, but Dr Taylor said the style of showing the mummy as if he was alive rather than physically idealised is of a much later period. There is no inscription on the trappings to identify the deceased. Dr Taylor said: 'What we do know is he would've been from a high status family as the body was very carefully treated. 'There is gold leaf on the body. The ancient Egyptians believed the gods had golden skin so it may have been to make the dead person god-like. 'There is also a lotus flower, a symbol of re-birth, drawn in ink on each knee.' The mismatched coffin may have been the result of Egyptians reusing them to bury different people or the result of antiquities dealers in the 19th century matching good quality items with each other even if they did not belong together to increase the overall price. He is one of eight mummies to be virtually unwrapped in the museum's Ancient Lives, New Discoveries exhibition. The men, women and children lived along the banks of the Nile in Egypt and Sudan between 3500BC and 700AD and their lives and deaths are now revealed in unprecedented detail. The images come from CT scanners - which are normally used to diagnose tumours, fractures and heart disease. The scanners use X-rays to produce images of slice after slice of the mummies. The information is then knitted together using software designed for the car industry. By calling up material of a specific density, it was possible to view bandages, skin or bone and so peel back layer after layer. The mummy of a child temple singer is also on display, with digital visualisations revealing developing teeth and long hair. She is depicted as a mature adult on the cartonnage, or casing, around her remains, but the tests indicate she was around seven-years-old. Her name is known to be Tjayasetimu from inscriptions on the cartonnage and she is thought to have died around 800BC. Neil MacGregor, director of the British Museum, said: 'This new technology is truly ground-breaking, allowing us to reconstruct and understand the lives of these individuals.' The exhibition runs until November 30.","It was first thought the embalmed body was a female dancer from Egypt .

"By . David Wilkes . He helped bring reversing vehicle alarms to the world. But now Chris Hanson-Abbott says so many people now find the sounds they make 'annoying' that he hopes to replace them with a less abrasive noise. 'Beep, beep, beep - people hate the sound of them,' admitted Mr Hanson-Abbott, chairman and founder of Brigade Electronics, who gave up his career in shipping in 1976 to concentrate on the devices after spotting a lorry in Japan with a rudimentary reversing alarm. Inventor Chris Hanson-Abbott says people find the sounds vehicles make when . they reverse 'annoying' - and has said he hopes to replace them with a . less abrasive noise . The alarms began to become widespread in the 1980s and have helped save lives thanks to their ear-piercing 'beeps'. But there have been mounting complaints about them. In 2012, there was even a reversing alarm flashpoint in Colne, Lancashire, with residents at loggerheads with a local supermarket. One commentator told the Lancashire Telegraph: '[The residents] have to go work and they are being woken up early and then can't get back to sleep. 'They go to work tired, they come home tired and then it happens all over again. It is horrendous for them.' Yesterday Mr Hanson-Abbott told the BBC: 'The sound tonal alarms make is very annoying', but added that has always been part of the point as they are meant to be heard and not ignored. But he said complaints about them and a growing awareness of noise pollution in general, has got him thinking about alternatives. He hopes the beeps will one day be replaced with single tones with 'broadband' sound, which resembles the crash of an ocean wave, albeit in short, staccato bursts. 'It sounds a lot nicer,' said Mr Hanson-Abbott. He developed the quote broadband sound in 1999 and since then around 3 million supermarket lorries have switched to it. He said: 'there are still an estimated 6 million vehicles to be changed'.","Chris Hanson-Abbott developed the sound in the late 1970s .

"By . David Wilkes . They were out there somewhere enjoying the Welsh countryside, snuffling about in the valley perhaps or snoozing in the woods. The pack of 23 wild boars which were let loose by burglars during a break in at a farm were quite possibly feeling as happy a pig in the proverbial yesterday. But the same could not be said of residents of the nearest town, Maesteg, near Bridgend, South Wales, who were anxiously awaiting for the beasts to be recaptured - as police warned they may charge anyone who approaches them. Warning: Greg Davies, owner of Cwmfelin boar farm in Bridgend, South Wales, lost 23 after a break-in last night . Brutal: Several of the animals were mutilated by the burglars in the overnight raid near Maesteg town . ‘I don’t think I’d want to get that close in the first place really,’ said Michelle Reid, 46, as she tucked into a fry-up in the Valley Café. ‘At least they haven’t decided to have a look round the shops today.’ Her sentiments were shared by an elderly woman out for a stroll. ‘I hope I don’t find one in my garden,’ she said. ‘They are vicious little things. I’d run if I saw one.’ As police and local farmers searched for the boars yesterday, Inspector Paul Thomas of South Wales Police said: ‘They may charge anyone who tries to approach them as the boars will be disorientated, confused and are not used to being out of their pens. Police are hunting the pack of 23 let loose into the Welsh valleys, which require a dangerous animals licence . Several of the 110-strong herd were found with cut throats or had their heads battered with a hammer . ‘These animals are recognised as posing a potential threat. People should take as much care as possible. We are investigating the criminal damage and the release of dangerous wild animals, which can carry a sentence in prison.’ The owner of the farm, Greg Davies, 46, holds a dangerous animals licence and had the necessary fencing in place to prevent escapes. He advised farmers to shoot the boars on sight if they are spotted. He said he lost 23 adults boars and 19 boarlets out of his 110-strong herd when his isolated farm a couple of miles from the town centre was raided by burglars. Several others were found dead with throats cut and heads battered with a hammer. Mr Davies said: ‘They are dangerous animals and should not be approached. Six people were arrested yesterday as the search continued for the missing 23. The rest of the pack is pictured . Mr Davies could see 70 or 80 of the animals running around the land when he arrived in the morning . ‘They will attack if they smell blood. Farmers with new lambs in their fields need to keep their eyes open for the boars. I’m advising them to shoot them straight away. They are carrion animals and will attack.’ Six people were yesterday arrested after the boars were freed, police said. Mr Davies said: ‘When I arrived at the farm on Sunday morning I could see 70 or 80 of them running around. The gate had been cut and they were released from their pen. It was very worrying. ‘We rounded up as many as we could and I’ve only just been able to establish how many are missing. I reckon it is 23 adults and 19 boarlets unaccounted for.’ He has been breeding the boars for six years with an adult fetching £350 to £400 - and also supplying specialist restaurants and delis as far away as Sussex and Scotland. He has been breeding the boars for six years with an adult fetching £350 to £400 . The raiders also took almost £10,000 of mechanical and electrical gear from the farm . The raiders also took more than £10,000 in mechanical and electrical gear, Mr Davies said. Wild boars are usually nocturnal, foraging in early morning or late afternoon and evening, and can travel up to 30 miles a day looking for food. They have even been known to charge at cars, damaging grilles and bodywork. But naturalist and BBC broadcaster Iolo Williams, the patron of the Wild Boar Trust said: ‘They’re fantastic animals, fascinating things. They have a bad reputation and I don’t understand why. ‘They are very secretive, they are very shy and probably the first thing they’ll do is they’ll head for woodland cover. There’s quite a bit of woodland in the Maesteg area - I’m pretty sure that’s where people will find most of them.’","Burglars freed 23 of 110-strong pack from Cwmfelin farm in Bridgend .

"By . David Wilkes . It is a line-up like no other... from a Second World War fighter pilot and a famous comedian to A-list actors and renowned academics. Geoffrey Wellum, 93, who was the youngest Spitfire pilot in the Battle of Britain, will make a rare public appearance at the Chalke Valley History Festival, sponsored by the Daily Mail. On the bill are Al Murray, known for his Pub Landlord act, actor Damian Lewis, War Horse author Michael Morpurgo, journalist Kate Adie, Ian Hislop, the editor of Private Eye, and Jeremy Paxman. Guests:  Spitfire pilot Geoffrey Wellum is to speak at the Chalke Valley History Festival about his war service while Al Murray is to deliver a talk entitled Watching War Films With My Dad . Tudor expert Suzannah Lipscomb and historians Antony Beevor and Dan Snow will speak at the event, tickets for which go on sale today. Murray, who did a history degree at Oxford University, will give a talk titled Watching War Films With My Dad. Lieutenant Colonel Ingram Murray served with the Royal Engineers. He knew many who fought in the 1939-45 conflict, and passed on his expert knowledge to his son. As a result, Murray says he ‘can’t help himself’ when he spots inaccuracies in blockbusters such as 1969’s The Battle of Britain. Of the film’s ‘German’ bombers, he says: ‘They’re not German planes, they’re Spanish planes made under licence after the war, which in an odd twist are powered by made-under-licence British Merlin engines.’ Murray, 45, told the Mail being such a pedant ‘can drive a man crazy’ – but history is ‘as important as physics’. ‘If you want to know where you’re going you’ve got to know where you’ve come from.’ Under fire: Al Murray says he can't help but correct mistakes in blockbusters such as the 1969 film The Battle of Britain, pictured, because of the knowledge he was passed by his father . He is a judge of the Penguin Chalke Valley History Prize for children’s historical fiction, and said of the festival: ‘The opportunity to get up close to people who are such experts is really, really brilliant.’ Journalist Max Hastings will speak on aspects of the First World War alongside guests including Miss Adie, Michael Gove and Jeremy Paxman . Squadron Leader Wellum, who was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and whose memoir First Light topped the bestsellers list, will talk about his war service.The eclectic speakers also include Cold War expert Peter Hennessy, former England cricket captain David Gower, Philip Mould of BBC show Fake or Fortune?, actor John Sessions and evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins. As the centenary of the start of the First World War approaches, Miss Adie, journalist Max Hastings, Education Secretary Michael Gove and Jeremy Paxman will all speak on aspects of the conflict. ‘Living history’ includes a First World War trench experience and, marking 70 years since D-Day, a Second World War encampment. There will be talks by D-Day veterans Geoff Pattinson, from elite paratrooper unit 9 Para, and David Render, of the Sherwood Rangers Yeomanry, a tank regiment that gained more battle honours in the war than any other single unit. As well as Murray, history prize judges include Damian Lewis, Fast Show comedian Charlie Higson, and actress Haydn Gwynne. A two-day air show will feature the UK’s only flying B-17 Flying Fortress and a pair of Spitfires. The festival, in Ebbesbourne Wake near Salisbury, Wiltshire, runs from June 23 to 29.

"By . David Wilkes . Stuck waist deep in mud, what started as a sunny seaside stroll almost turned into a tragedy for these women and their dog. They were among three walkers rescued by firemen at the same spot in two separate incidents over the space of four hours. The drama unfolded in Kent, where storms caused huge mudslides from the clay cliffs. This left large, boggy deposits that crusted over as they dried in the sun, giving the appearance of being firm enough to walk on. Trapped: This is the terrifying moment two women got stuck waist-deep in a mudslide while walking their dogs in Herne Bay, Kent . Dramatic: Firefighters and members of the coastguard used inflatable equipment to save the trapped pair . Lucky: The dog was virtually unscathed after the dramatic incident. A commuity safety manger said dog walkers should not 'be putting their lives at risk' However, as these unnamed women found to their cost, anyone stepping on them was in danger of plunging in after a few steps. In . the first incident on Sunday, a dog-walker tried to cross the hazardous . patch between Herne Bay and Reculver at 11.30am with two small dogs . when it gave way. As the tide rose, she tried desperately to prise . herself out – but the thick, clinging mud proved too much. Whitstable’s . lifeboat was used to ferry ten firemen to nearby shingle from where . they could lay an inflatable bridge called a mud-path across the . cliff-fall so they could rescue her without sinking in themselves. Relieved: The woman comforts her Alsatian-cross after the harrowing experience on the bog in Kent . Separate incident: Hours earlier, a 60-year-old woman got stuck in virtually the same spot after she had taken her dog for a walk . Rescuers rushed to the scene to help the woman who had been walking near Reculver in Herne Bay, Kent . A platform was extended to the woman by firefighters while she lay rooted in the bog . The . unidentified woman, who was stuck for an hour, was brought back to . safety with her dogs, which were too light to sink into the mudslide. Yesterday, lifeboat helmsman Dave Parry said: ‘It might have looked . solid enough to walk across, but she got halfway and sank. The tide was . lapping around her.’ The . second incident happened at 3pm when two women, one in her 40s and the . other aged around 70, fell waist-deep after helping their Alsatian, . which was stuck. Firemen again used a mud path to rescue them. The pair were treated for shock before taking their dog home for a good bath.","Pair were involved in third incident at popular coastal spot in Kent .

"By . David Wilkes . For decades it had lurked in the depths of the lake, growing bigger by the week. Then the carnivorous monster took a fancy to the mackerel strip 14-year-old Will Sudders was using as a bait. At 5am the schoolboy was woken in his tent beside by the water’s edge when the electronic bite alarm on his rod began beeping and an epic struggle ensued during which the fish almost wrenched the rod from his hands. After 45 minutes, the 5ft 4in tall schoolboy finally landed the 7ft long Wels catfish - and a place for himself in the record books. Heroic effort: Teenager Will Sudders struggled to keep hold of his rod as he engaged in a 45-minute battle with the enormous 7ft long Wels catfish. It's thought to be the biggest fish ever caught in Britain by a junior angler . His impressive catch weighed 8st 10lb making it the biggest freshwater fish caught by a junior angler in Britain – and probably the country’s biggest living freshwater fish. As it was also more than a stone heavier him, having reeled it in by himself Will, who weighs 7st 7lb, needed help from his uncle Graham, 60, to drag it out of the lake and onto the bank. In time-honoured tradition, the teenager then had his photograph taken alongside the gigantic specimen before weighing it and throwing it back into five-acre Oakwood Park Lake in Thetford, Norfolk. Will, of Colchester, Essex, said: ‘After two days of only catching carp suddenly my rod alarm went off and my reel started screaming. ‘I struck into the fish and immediately the rod bent forward and was almost ripped from my hands. I knew that I had hooked one of the big catfish in the lake. Behemoth: Will snared the fish himself but needed help from his uncle Graham to get it out of the water . ‘When the fish eventually came in close it roared off again and then battle recommenced. Eventually the fish tired and I was able to get into the water with my uncle and we retrieved it together.’ His father Andrew Sudders, 52, a non-fisherman who runs a wholesale soft drinks company, said: ‘He was triumphant when he got home and very eager to show us the photos. My wife Jane sent them in to Angler’s Mail magazine.’ Experts verified the record status of the April 17 catch, which was declared a ‘hot news exclusive’ on the front page of the magazine’s latest edition. Will took up fishing four years with a £5 rod his mother bought him from Argos, but now has all the latest high-tech equipment. Incredibly, it is not the biggest fish he has ever caught – as he landed a 12st 7lb albino catfish from the River Ebro in Spain in 2012. 'I struck into the fish and immediately the rod bent forward and was almost ripped from my hands. I knew that I had hooked one of the big catfish in the lake' But it is more than twice the size of the biggest catfish he had previously caught in Britain, so came as a big surprise. ‘It has really made my year and we are only in the spring,’ said Will. Proud Mrs Sudders said: ‘Every time Will puts his rod into the water he pulls out something special.’ The biggest catfish ever caught in Britain weighed 10st 4lb and was landed by chef James Jones in Essex in 2012, but that fish has since died. Catfish records were suspended by the British Records Fish Committee in 2000 because they are a non-native species. At the time the record was 4st 6lb. BRFC chairman Mike Heylin said of Will’s catch: ‘It’s highly likely it is the biggest fish in Britain - I don’t know of any fish that is bigger. I’m also positive that no junior angler has ever caught a freshwater fish this big in Britain.’ Some large catfish in Oakwood Park Lake have been caught several times by fishermen over the years and can be identified by scars on their bodies. Angler Alex Fanshawe, 32, battled for 15 minutes wrestling a giant catfish - 'The Duke' - at the same lake in Thetford, Norfolk. The Duke was thought to be the biggest fish in the lake until Will's catch . Among those is one nicknamed ‘The Duke’, which weighs 8st 7lb and was caught most recently by Alex Fanshawe, 32, a disc jockey, of Ruislip, north-west London, on Saturday. ‘The Duke’ was thought to be the biggest fish in the lake until Will’s catch. The lake’s owners Kate and Gideon Dyson today confirmed that the fish Will caught was not ‘The Duke’. ‘There’s half a dozen fish over 7st in the lake which have been caught quite often, but this one wasn’t known before,’ said Mrs Dyson. ‘It must have taken every ounce of energy in Will’s body to land it.’ Wels catfish, also known as sheatfish, are found in areas of central, southern and eastern Europe, as well as near the Baltic and Caspian Seas. They are a scaleless fresh and brackish water fish, recognisable by a broad, flat head and wide mouth. They can live for around 30 years and have excellent hearing. Wels catfish feed on insects, crustaceans and other fish, as well as frogs, mice, rats and water birds including ducks. There have been instances where the breed has been spotted lunging from the water to catch pigeons on the shore. They live in large, warm lakes and deep slow-flowing rivers. In rare cases the species can grow up to 13ft and reach more than 400lbs making it the second largest freshwater breed of fish after the beluga sturgeon.","Will Sudders caught 7ft Wels catfish after 45 minute battle .

"By . David Wilkes . A fox in the hen house is usually a recipe for disaster. But having crept into a coop while its eight residents were pecking about outside, this cunning customer just curled up on a nest of their eggs for a nap. Maybe he was tired and it was the closest thing he could find to a feather bed, or perhaps he was slyly dreaming of a chicken omelette for tea. Pupils found this rather cosy-looking fox keeping a nest of freshly laid eggs warm in their school chicken coop . Whatever the reason, once snugly ensconced he was not going to be henpecked into leaving. He . barely batted an eyelid when pupils found him lying there when they . went to collect the eggs from their primary school’s chickens during . lunch break.

Chickens continues to scratch around in the garden outside while the creature happily kept their eggs warm . Mrs France, 57, said: ‘The chickens . were quite happily scratching around in the garden – oblivious to the . fox.’ Staff later moved the creature on and all the eggs were still . intact. 'I don't suppose I'll ever take another photo like that! Mrs France said the pupils ran excitedly into her office to tell her about the bizarre sight. She added: 'The children who saw the fox were amazed that they had got so close to a wild animal. 'As . luck would have it, my camera was on my desk as I had earlier taken . some staff photos so I took the camera with me to have a look.

"By . David Wilkes . At times, David Cameron must feel as though the weight of the world is on his shoulders. And his three-year-old daughter only added to the load yesterday – when she hitched a ride on his back as he took her to nursery. But she was clearly one burden Mr Cameron did not find the least bit onerous. He smiled as he strode down the pavement with Florence perched on top of him, after she chose to travel by Prime Minister rather than use her purple scooter. Mr Cameron looked more like the entrant of a gurning competition as his daughter playfully pulled at his face . David Cameron was all smiles as he carried daughter Florence on his shoulders through the streets of Westminster . The Prime Minister likes to boast of having a vision for the country but could not see at all during his walk to nursery . Leaving Downing Street Mr Cameron carried a scooter in one hand while Florence enjoyed a bird's eye view . Wearing a multi-coloured polka dot . safety helmet and with her father holding her steady by the ankles, . Florence could not resist cheekily covering Mr Cameron’s eyes, before . grabbing his face with both hands and making it clear who was boss. But the Prime Minister still looked every inch the relaxed dad, holding on to his daughter’s scooter with his free hand. Unusually . for a man who has closely guarded his children’s privacy since moving . to Number 10, Mr Cameron, 47, did not seem bothered who saw his display . of closeness with his youngest, and this set of pictures has been . approved by Downing Street for publication. After dropping Florence off, it was business as usual for the Prime Minister as he dashed back for a Cabinet meeting. Issues on the agenda . included Ukraine and public sector pay, where Chief Secretary to the . Treasury Danny Alexander updated ministers on changes being made to . Whitehall salaries. Mr Cameron has spoken candidly about the challenge of juggling the school run with running the country. He . said: ‘Maybe once a week, sometimes once a fortnight, tragically . sometimes once a month I manage to take my children to school, but it’s . got to be possible to be a decent husband, a good father and a good . prime minister at the same time.’ When the shoulders became too much Mr Cameron switched to carrying his three-year-old daughter while holding a scooter and a bag in his right hand . An aide to the Prime Minister was also roped in to hold a bag while Mr Cameron had Florence on his shoulders . Every parent will have sympathy for the battle to get toddlers to get a move on in the morning, so it was no surprise that in the end Mr Cameron picked Florence up and carried her on his shoulders. With her hands in danger of covering dad's eyes, Mr Cameron was also seen carrying a buggy and shopping bag as they made their way through Westminster. Asked about being seen on the school run, the PM once responded by saying: 'Maybe once a week, sometimes once a fortnight, tragically sometimes once a month I manage to take my children to school, but it's got to be possible to be a decent husband, a good father and a good prime minister at the same time.'","Prime Minister leaves Number 10 for the short walk to nursery .

"By . David Wilkes . Nicknamed Streaks due to their speed and sleek lines, they were the pride of Britain’s railways. The A4 class locomotives were built in the Thirties to haul the fastest express passenger trains from London to York, Newcastle and Edinburgh. With their revolutionary design inspired by Bugatti race cars, they were the first of their kind to speed along the tracks at 90 to 100mph, 25mph faster than their predecessors. The world's fastest steam locomotive, Mallard (far right) and six of her sister trains were gathered in Shildon, County Durham, yesterday . Mallard still holds the record for the fastest steam locomotive ever at 126mph, a speed which electric trains reach every day today . The A4 class locomotives were used to transport high-speed passenger carriges between London, York, Newcastle and Edinburgh . As well as Mallard, the six include Sir Nigel Gresley - named after the designer - Union of South Africa, Bittern, Dominion of Canada and Dwight D. Eisenhower . In their heyday, it was every schoolboy’s dream to drive one — and they still evoke all the romance of the golden age of steam, when British still meant best. Now the last remaining six have been reunited for one final time. Among them is the legendary Mallard, which still holds the record for the fastest steam locomotive in the world after hitting 126mph at Stoke Bank, near Grantham on the East Coast main  line in 1938 — a record that’s unlikely ever to be beaten. The attempt was set up amid great secrecy, not only because the Germans had achieved over 120mph, but also because rival companies in Britain could have stolen a march on the daring record bid. It was driven that day by Joseph Duddington, 61, assisted by fireman Thomas Bray, whose back-breaking job it was to shovel tons of coal into the white-heat firebox as the rocking train hurtled down the track. World beater: The Mallard pictured in 1938 as it was about to start its record-breaking run along the East Coast Mainline when it hit 126mph . Success: The team from Mallard celebrate their record run near Peterborough 75 years ago. The challenge was so intense it left the loco in need of repair . In action: The Sir Nigel Grestley takes passengers across North England from Carlisle to Settle, travelling through Yorkshire . They don't make them like that anymore: The Bittern departs from Goathland Station in North Yorkshire as part of the 'Flying Scotsman' train service . The 75th anniversary of that epic event, in July last year, triggered the bringing together of the six locos. They are the only surviving examples of the 35 of their kind that were designed by genius Sir Nigel Gresley for the London & North Eastern Railway and which marked the zenith of British locomotive building. Polished, oiled and gleaming, the six 100-ton steam locos have been lined up side by side for a week-long display named the Great Goodbye at the National Railway Museum’s site at Shildon, Co. Durham. Two — Dwight D. Eisenhower and Dominion of Canada — were brought over from museums on the other side of the Atlantic for the reunion, which is attracting tens of thousands of visitors from all over the world. Like Mallard, which is part of Britain’s National Railway Museum collection, those two are no longer in running order, but merely exhibited in gleaming condition. Every boy's dream: Many children dreamed of driving a steam locomotive, here we explain how the controls of Mallard worked . Great gathering: Over the last four days 50,000 people have gathered at the National Railway Museum to see the six engines together . Sizing up: The fearsome machines were not just epic in terms of ability, but also sheer scale, as this picture shows . Labour of love: Huw Cairns works on the cosmetically restored Dwight D Eisenhower at the National Railway Museum in York . But the other three — Bittern, Sir Nigel Gresley and Union of South Africa, owned by separate rail enthusiasts — still earn a living hauling steam charters on the main line. Anthony Coulls, senior curator of rail vehicle collections at the museum, said: ‘These locos were built to create an impression and they definitely still do! The drivers were the fastest men on earth — the Formula 1 drivers or airline pilots of their day. ‘These were prestige trains and to be in charge of one was exciting and glamorous.’ The design was a massive success in public relations terms — the public adored them. One of the A4s — fuelled by up to seven tons of coal — could race between London and Edinburgh, picking up water on the move from long troughs laid between the rails. Because the work of the two men of the footplate — the driver and fireman — was so arduous, Gresley designed a tiny corridor through the tender that would allow a relief crew to take over on the move. Precision engineering: Gresley, who designed the trains, had intended for them to eventually reach 130mph, but that dream was never realised . Namesake: Among the visitors was one Mallard David Elcoat ¿ who was born in 1951 and named after the locomotive . Bittern, Sir Nigel Gresley and Union of South Africa, which are owned by separate rail enthusiasts, still earn a living hauling steam charters on the main line . Soon after Mallard’s record-breaking run — which left the workings of the thrashed loco needing some repair — World War II would put an end to the most glamorous era on British railways, with the glorious Streaks stripped of some of their streamlining for the duration and plodding along at more pedestrian speeds, their paintwork stained and dirty. Gresley’s hopes of even higher speeds — 130mph was thought possible — went unfulfilled. Then diesel and electric locos took over from the Fifties and today reach the once amazing speed of 125mph on a daily basis. But most railwaymen admit today’s trains lack the glamour and looks of the Streaks. And yesterday, the surviving A4s were back at their gleaming best. Among the visitors was one Mallard David Elcoat — who was born in 1951 and named after the locomotive. His father was not only a railway enthusiast, but also a loco driver with the rival London Midland & Scottish railway. The museum has copied his birth certificate for their records. A one enthusiast said: ‘These locos were just superb, and still are. After all, you can’t imagine some-one naming their child after a diesel, can you?’","Six A4 class locomotive brought together to celebrate Mallard's steam speed world record 75 years ago .

"By . David Wilkes . Locking the gates to the public park must have seemed the best way to prevent travellers getting in and setting up an illegal camp. But such common sense is no match for the diktats of health and safety – even if it is the travellers’ own determined efforts to get in that are creating the risk. So for the second time in six months the gates to Wild Park, on the outskirts of Brighton, were unlocked and a convoy of caravans admitted to the conservation area. It was decided that the travellers’ attempts to get round the locked gate – including mounting the pavement . and driving over mounds built with the specific purpose of keeping them . out – was putting them at risk of injury. Last August: A 30-strong convoy of caravans turned up and officials unlocked the vehicle access gate because they were concerned the travellers might hurt themselves as they tried to get in to the park . In . was only in August last  year that the gate to Wild Park was unlocked . because of similar  fears that the travellers might hurt themselves or . other road users by trying to get in. And, . like last time, the police cannot get involved because the travellers . were let on to the park. So once again the taxpayer faces a costly civil . court action to get them off the site – and an expensive clean-up after . they have moved on. Yesterday . a spokesman for Green Party-led Brighton and Hove City Council said: . ‘The gate was opened on the agreement of council officers and police . officers as a measure to avoid danger to road users. ‘This . has been done before and all enforcement options are being kept under . review.’ It means local residents will once again be put off using the . park, Brighton and Hove’s largest local nature reserve. Last . year the unofficial camp swelled to 50 caravans, which stayed for up to . a fortnight before they could be evicted. A repeat performance of the . farcical situation began when travellers attempted to get in five days . ago. Residents then watched in horror as officials opened the gates to let the convoy of 19 caravans in at 6pm on Thursday. If . the gates had remained locked, any travellers could have been evicted . immediately because they would have been committing an offence under . Section 61 of the Criminal Justice and Public  Order Act. The . latest arrivals in the park are a mixture of Irish travellers and . English gipsies, the council says, some of whom arrived after being . evicted from a car park at a  sports centre. Figures . show that town halls were left with a £1.2 million bill last year for . dealing with travellers who  illegally pitch their caravans on . council-owned land. Old encampment: Another view of travellers at Wild Park last August, after the council opened the gates . The . bill, which has to be met through council tax payments, included . clearing up hazardous waste dumped by the travellers, providing security . guards around their illegal camps and even putting in portable toilets . for them. In total, the bill . came to around £400,000 each for legal costs, the clean-up and the . expenses to secure the site after the travellers had been evicted. The . results from a Freedom of Information survey revealed the council that . last year faced the biggest bills for dealing with illegal travellers . was Leeds (£211,153) with Brighton and Hove in second place (£194,147). Jonathan . Isaby, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Cleaning up after illegal . sites costs taxpayers a fortune as does the policing of sites so it’s . vital a long term and sustainable solution is found. ‘Residents . are often left fuming when they have to clean up after anti-social . behaviour while some are allowed to openly flout the law. ‘The . best solution is to ensure legal pitches are available to  travellers, . thereby allowing the police to take a tougher line on those camping . illegally.’","New convoy of around 20 caravans arrives at Wild Park in Brighton .

"By . David Wilkes . The Foreign Office rejected an invitation to stage a prestigious event in Britain celebrating Press freedom – prompting suspicion the Government feared further criticism over its Royal Charter on Press regulation. United Nations agency UNESCO asked to hold its World Press Freedom Day, one of the aims of which is ‘to defend the media from attacks on their independence’, in London for the first time this year. But the Foreign Office said no, saying it had not been given enough notice for the event, which has an expected attendance of 400 to 500 people. The Foreign Office (building pictured) rejected an invitation to stage a prestigious event celebrating Press freedom, it has been suggested . Yesterday a source close to the arrangements said: ‘The British are saying the reasons are logistical but it seems obvious this could not be held in Britain without the problems over the Royal Charter being highlighted internationally. ‘You might well think the Government was afraid it would get a black eye. But they are now facing two black eyes.’ UNESCO is now considering holding the event in Morocco, where Press law prohibits criticism of the monarchy and effectively bars independent coverage of taboo subjects such as the military, national security, religion and sexuality. Journalists in Morocco, according to watchdog Freedom House, face violence and intimidation, as well as heavy fines and prison sentences, in retribution for their stories. Press freedom organisations last month urged David Cameron to persuade Parliament to repeal legislation underpinning the Government’s Royal Charter on Press regulation, which was drawn up by politicians in the wake of the Leveson Inquiry into alleged wrongdoing by journalists. In a letter to the Prime Minister, seven major international bodies – including the World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers – described the Charter as ‘incomprehensible arcana’ and warned that ‘autocratic’ foreign leaders were already using it to justify repression. Newspapers and magazines have refused to sign up to the new regime over fears it would bring to an end 300 years of press freedom. Instead, the Press is establishing a fully independent body to police its activities, known as the Independent Press Standards Organisation. It will be able to impose fines of up to £1million for serious and systemic wrongdoing. Press freedom organisations last month urged David Cameron to persuade Parliament to repeal legislation underpinning the Government¿s Royal Charter on Press regulation . Word Press Freedom Day is an annual event held every May 3, and includes the awarding of UNESCO’s World Press Freedom Prize for courage in journalism and a seminar. It celebrated its 20th anniversary last year, when it was held in San Jose, Costa Rica. It is held in a different country each year and has never been held in Britain. UNESCO says the aims of  World Press Freedom Day are ‘to evaluate Press freedom around the world, to defend the media from attacks on their independence and to pay tribute to journalists who have lost their lives in the exercise of their profession’. UNESCO approached the Foreign Office having originally planned to hold the event in Indonesia. If it cannot be held in Morocco, the event is likely to be held in Paris, at UNESCO’s headquarters. A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘We were recently approached by UNESCO after their plans for the event to be hosted in a different country had fallen through. While we are very supportive of the aims of World Press Freedom day, we judged that we would not be able to prepare a suitable set of events to mark the occasion at short notice. The FCO is involved in hosting three major summits this year.’ News of the refusal comes after the industry’s bid to seek a judicial review of the Privy Council’s decision not to approve a rival Royal Charter was rejected – in a one- paragraph ruling which took 17 weeks to arrive. A secretive committee of four ministers approved a Royal Charter to regulate the Press last year. The Privy Council, which advises the Queen,  rubberstamped the plans after newspapers were denied a  last-ditch legal bid to halt the process. Four newspaper and magazine industry bodies went to the High Court to seek an injunction to prevent the Privy Council proceeding. But it was only when the hearing was under way that lawyers for the industry realised that, without warning the papers, the judges had also decided to rule on a separate application for judicial review of the Privy Council’s ‘unfair, irrational and unlawful’ decision not to approve a rival Royal Charter drawn up by  the newspapers. Lord Justice Richards, sitting with Mr Justice Sales, rejected the application for judicial review and for an injunction. The two judges retired to consider their verdict for 15 minutes before returning to deliver a ruling that ran to 3,000 words – leaving a strong suspicion it had been prepared in advance. The industry then applied for permission to appeal against the High Court decision to refuse to grant permission to apply for judicial review. This time it took 17 weeks for a decision to be made – and when it finally was, it amounted to one paragraph in which Lord Justice Laws refused permission to appeal.","UN's UNESCO request to hold World Press Freedom Day in London .

"By . David Wilkes . 'Greed is good’ may once have been the only mantra bankers were interested in. But now, it seems, the Gordon Gekkos of the world are meditating on some rather more peaceful ideas. A so-called ‘quiet revolution’ is gripping the City of London – with soaring numbers of fast-paced financiers finding solace in ‘mindfulness’. 'A quiet revolution': Soaring numbers of fast-paced financiers in London are finding solace in 'mindfulness' A form of stress relief pioneered in the US in the 1970s, it draws on ancient Buddhist ideas to combat mental suffering and encourage practitioners to slow down and ‘inhabit the moment’. As well as meditation, practitioners use breathing exercises and stretching in the quest to become more accepting of their feelings. Hollywood stars Meg Ryan and Goldie Hawn are advocates – as is Kok-Song Ng, who finds time to meditate for 25 minutes twice a day while working as chairman of global investments at GIC, Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund. He has said: ‘Meditation brings calm and equanimity – not to be over-elated when times are good or over-depressed when times are bad. I think it gives you greater clarity of mind.’ Advocates: Hollywood stars Meg Ryan (left) and Goldie Hawn (right) are advocates of the form of stress relief . While the idea of high-flying executives meditating between meetings may seem unlikely, increasing numbers of banks, fund managers and professional services firms are adopting such methods of stress relief. The CFA Institute for investment professionals is said to be considering launching a meditation programme, while KPMG, Goldman Sachs and Unilever have promoted mindfulness in wellbeing seminars. The Bank of England has also run meditation ‘taster’ sessions attended by dozens of staff as part of a series of ‘Working Lives’ seminars. Other firms are said to be reluctant to publicise their meditation initiatives for fear of being perceived as ‘new age’. But Sally Boyle, a human resources director at Goldman Sachs, said: ‘In years to come we’ll be talking about mindfulness as we talk about exercise now.’ Professor Stephen Palmer, founder and director of the Centre for Stress Management in London, believes the credit crunch has prompted business executives to look for an outlet for anxiety. He said: ‘We can blame Lehman Brothers. When people have their worlds turned upside down like that, it offers a chance to reflect on life and ask “What am I doing?”’ Gordon Gekko, a character played by Michael Douglas in the 1987 film Wall Street, famously said: ‘Greed, for lack of a better word, is good.’ Popular with MPs: Books with a spiritual theme are among the top ten taken out of the House of Commons library . Inspired by ancient Buddhist meditation, mindfulness courses were developed in the late 1970s by US doctors to combat stress. The guiding principle is to live more ‘in the moment’, spending less time going over past stresses and worrying about future problems. Techniques include moving the focus of attention around the body and observing sensations that arise – the so-called ‘body scan’. A secular practice, it is said to help people recognise and overcome negative thoughts while noticing small pleasures. Thousands of mindfulness sessions are prescribed to NHS patients every year to help treat anxiety and depression. Books with a spiritual theme are among the top ten taken out of the House of Commons library. Mindful Manifesto: How Doing Less And Noticing More Can Help Us Thrive In A Stressed-Out World, by Dr Jonty Heaversedge and Ed Halliwell, was one of the most popular with MPs. The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics And Religion by Jonathan Haidt was also taken out seven times. The Lonely Planet guide to Burma, where Buddhism is the main religion, was also borrowed seven times last year. The most popular book with 16 loans was How Parliament Works by Robert Rogers, a guide to the complexities of Westminster.","Soaring numbers of financiers in London finding solace in 'mindfulness'

"By . David Wilkes . Faced with a school project on space, Lucas Whiteley boldly went where few four-year-olds have gone before . . . and asked the big boys at NASA for help. With a little help from his dad, the primary school pupil sent a video of himself asking three questions to the US space agency’s website. To his delight, Lucas received an email with a ten-minute video made for him by research engineer Ted Garbeff of NASA’s Ames Research Center.Scroll down for video . That's out of this world! Lucas Whiteley, pictured with his father James, received a personal response to his space-related questions from the experts at NASA . Mr . Garbeff, whose work in experimental fluid physics includes studying the . wake of space capsules, answered the questions and gave a virtual tour . of the base in Mountain View, California. Teachers at Lucas’s primary school in Wrenthorpe, West Yorkshire, were so impressed they played it in assembly. Lucas’s . father James Whiteley, 37, an app designer, said: ‘When I was a kid I . wrote to NASA and got a brochure, so I thought we might be lucky if we . sent a video of Lucas asking questions. ‘What we got back three . weeks later was amazing. Obviously Ted has thought about his audience . and gone to a lot of trouble just for them. At your service: NASA engineer Ted Garbeff responded with a 10-minute video answering all four-year-old Lucas's questions . Guided tour: Ted Garbeff gave a virtual tour round his base in California and answered little Lucas's questions . Whoooosh! The NASA engineer used models of his rockets to help answer the questions for Lucas's school project . Chuffed: Father James was over the moon, saying it had been 'the most amazing response to my son's questions' ‘When I sat down to watch it with Lucas he had a big smile on his face. ‘Ted is a fantastic bloke to go out of his way for someone he doesn’t know on the other side of the world.’ And the big questions? First of all, Lucas asked: ‘How many stars are there?’ Mr Garbeff said no one has counted, but scientists estimate that there are 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. Close to the action: NASA space expert Ted also talked about animals in space and which countries came second and third in the race to land on the moon, which was one of Lucas's questions . Transatlantic message: The engineer was filmed giving a tour of the base and advised Lucas and his classmates to listen to their teachers, before saying he hoped to see them all 'up in space one day' Space fanatic: Lucas' father James said: 'When I was a kid I wrote to NASA and got a brochure, so when Lucas was doing a project on space I thought we might be lucky if we sent a video of Lucas asking some questions' Science enthusiast: Lucas is fascinated by all things science and space so was obviously thrilled when he received the message . Next, . Lucas wanted to know ‘who came second and third in the race to the . moon’. Mr Garbeff said he would place Russia second, and China third – . although only the US has put a man on the moon. Finally, Lucas asked if . any animals have been sent to the moon. They haven’t – but  several have . gone to space, Mr Garbeff said. He also explained that his work . involves studying planes and rockets and ‘figuring out how things work’. Thanking Lucas for his ‘great’ questions, he added: ‘It’s really a . lot of fun being an engineer – you get to play with great toys all day . and most importantly you get to learn about the world. ‘It wasn’t . easy, though,  getting here, I had to work really hard. So remember to . work hard in school and listen to your teacher.’ He urged Lucas to work . together with his class to solve problems, and signed off: ‘So hopefully . one of these days I’ll see you all – maybe up in space.’ Thrilled: James said the video was 'amazing' and added that Ted had thought about his audience and gone to a lot of trouble just for them .

"By . David Wilkes . Turning the semi-derelict medieval farm into a charming rural home has gobbled up her £600,000 life savings and a decade of her time. But widow Lorna Sowrey has now been told she will have to tear it down...because she should be sharing it with turkeys. The 500-year-old building in a remote hamlet on north Dartmoor is a very rare example of a Devon longhouse with a partially uncovered ‘shippon’ - an indoor area for livestock. Defeat: Lorna Sowrey's renovations to her home in Devon could be gobbled up if she refuses to keep turkeys . Disputed area: Mrs Sowrey in the farm's medieval 'shippon', which always had an agricultural use . The arrangement was common  in the medieval period, when humans and animals lived together under the same roof. Dartmoor National Park Authority insists that half the shippon should have been kept for ‘agricultural use’ to preserve Middle Venton Farm’s ‘cultural significance’. Dispute: Mrs Sowrey is up against national park laws . Mrs Sowrey, 77, told the Mail: ‘I asked what I could do with the shippon if it was agricultural. I was told I could keep a cart-horse or turkeys – but they would be 6ft from my dining table. ‘It’s ridiculous, they want me to create a museum that no one will ever visit. My house is not open to the public, and I don’t want to start turkey farming at my age.’ Yesterday the authority refused her application for retrospective planning permission for the restorations. Having spent £100,000 on the shippon alone, she now faces having to spend even more undoing her hard work. If the authority has its way, half the dining area could be carpeted, but the rest of the room would have an earth floor and an unglazed window. Planning officers said the survival of half the shippon before the work was a ‘crucial feature’ when it was awarded a Grade II*-listing in 1988 – meaning it is a ‘particularly important building of more than special interest’, the next category down from a Grade I-listing. Mrs Sowrey bought the cottage in Drewsteignton, near Exeter, in 2003 for £400,000 with her husband John, a retired RAF Air Commodore and an ace fighter pilot in the Second World War. They were granted planning permission in 2009 after submitting an application which retained the agricultural character of the shippon. Before he died aged 90 in 2010, Mr Sowrey asked her to finish the restoration as his last wish. Preservation: Mrs Sowrey's home in the Dartmoor National Park pictured the way it used to look... ... and how it looks now after she spent £600,000 converting it. Her retrospective planning application failed . When the couple bought the house, part of the shippon had rush matting over an earth floor. Mrs Sowrey then laid concrete over the 15ft by 18ft area, which she uses as a storage space. But the authority says this amounts to it being used for domestic purposes and diminishes its ‘historic interest’. Last night a spokesman said unauthorised works without the prior grant of Listed Building Consent is a criminal offence under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990. A future meeting will consider whether remedial action must take place and if so, what specific works and over what time scale. Planning consultant John Milverton said: ‘I’ve never seen such a bizarre situation. To try to turn the clock back like this makes no sense whatsoever.’ Orders: Planning authorities say parts of the home including this one should be dug up again and changed . Rare: There are five or six unconverted shippons on Dartmoor and fewer than 20 converted ones .","Lorna Sowrey, 77, turned rare 500-year-old Devon longhouse into a home .

"By . David Wilkes . Created: . 08:26 EST, 6 February 2014 . With its palatial interior, grand Elizabethan features and rustic views over the Malvern Hills, Sabina Carter’s £1.25million apartment was the embodiment of good taste and propriety. Unfortunately, the same could not quite be said for its owner. For after an unseemly row with a wealthy neighbour in the 17th century stately home, Carter sent her an email telling her to ‘go hang yourself’. Evicted: Sabina Carter was thrown out of the 17th century Westwood House after she sent a 'disturbing and distressing' email to the head of the residents' committee. This photograph was taken in 2009 . The . 50-year-old divorcee composed the message to residents’ committee . chairman Janice Brookes after defaulting by £11,000 on service charges . for the upkeep of the grounds and Grade I-listed building, a court . heard. The imposing Westwood . House, nestled in the rolling countryside near Droitwich in . Worcestershire, is split into 12 luxury flats and all residents have to . pay monthly service charges. Prosecutor . Jackie Rogers said Carter, who was made bankrupt in 2010, struggled to . get on with neighbours, had been taken to court by the residents’ committee over the money she owed and was given a harassment warning in . September 2012 ordering her to have no contact with Mrs Brookes. But . in November last year, the former Lufthansa air hostess sent Mrs . Brookes, a jeweller, an obscene email, including the line: ‘My only . other suggestion is that you go and hang yourself but with your own low . IQ you couldn’t manage that either.’ Luxury: The property, which includes an Elizabethan salon with 24ft-high ceilings, a kitchen and two bedrooms, was put on the market for £1.25million, but it has struggled to sell . Mother-of-two . Carter pleaded guilty to sending an email that was grossly offensive or . of an indecent, obscene or menacing character at Worcester Magistrates’ Court on Wednesday. In a . victim impact statement, Mrs Brookes, 48, said she found the email . ‘distressing and disgusting’. Carter was given a  12-month conditional . discharge and ordered to pay £250  compensation to Mrs Brookes, as well . as £85 costs and a £15 victim surcharge. Paul . Nicholls, defending,  said that Carter had been  ‘under strain’ and was . being evicted for defaulting on her mortgage repayments. He added: ‘It is not a nice email. She wrote as a 15-year-old rather than a 50-year-old. Things have settled down now.’ Carter’s eviction marks the end of her dream of living in the opulent surroundings Westwood House has to offer. Approached . via a three-quarter-of-a-mile private drive, it was built by the . Packington family, who rose from obscurity – along with many English . Protestant families – under Henry VIII. When . Carter bought her two-bedroom, 3,000 sq ft flat for £237,000 in 1999, . it was dilapidated and run-down, and she poured thousands of pounds into . restoring it. Disputes: Prosecutor Jackie Rogers told Worcester Magistrates' Court that Carter struggled to get on with neighbours at the 17th century mansion . But it . already boasted many impressive features, including an Elizabethan salon . with 24ft-high ceilings and massive original fireplace. The plaster . decoration on the wall dates from Elizabeth I’s reign, while the ceiling . itself was a gift from Charles II in recognition of the Packington . family’s loyalty throughout the Civil War. But . Carter began to struggle to keep up with the running costs of the flat, . which came to around £4,000 a year, including £120-a-month service . charges and £2,000 council tax. She . put the flat on the market for £1.25million in 2009. In an interview . with the Mail on Sunday at the time, Carter, who makes her living . selling English luxury goods to supermarkets in her native Germany, . said: ‘I want the money. And I want to downsize to somewhere more cosy . and less grand.’ The . interview was accompanied by a photograph of her perched on a white sofa . in the spectacular salon with her young children. However, she failed to find a buyer, and was forced to remortgage the property until she was made bankrupt. Yesterday, neighbours said they were relieved Carter had gone. Budget: Carter bought the dilapidated apartment for just £237,000 in 1999 when she came to Worcestershire to buy up high-end businesses which she then sold back to wealthy Germans . One . said: ‘She was a nightmare. People living here have a certain . expectation of lifestyle and she couldn’t accept that her personal . circumstances meant she was living beyond her means. ‘It . was a sad way to end her time here but it’s not right to lash out at . fellow neighbours just because they ask for money which is rightly . owed.’ Jacqueline Pointon, . 69, who has lived in the house since 1953 when her father bought one of . the first apartments, said: ‘People are relieved she has finally gone. The flat is empty now.’ And another former neighbour said the other residents may even celebrate Carter’s departure with a party. She . said: ‘We are mightily relieved and we will no doubt be having a little . farewell party in her honour – which she most certainly is not invited . to.’ Carter now plans to move back to Germany where her mother is undergoing chemotherapy, the court heard. Mrs Brookes was on holiday in Barbados yesterday and unavailable for comment.","Sabina Carter lived in 17th century Westwood House near Droitwich .

"By . Daniel Martin, Whitehall Correspondent . Nick Clegg has been accused of 'unbelievable hypocrisy' over a spare room subsidy U-turn . Nick Clegg was accused of ‘unbelievable hypocrisy’ last night after withdrawing support for one of the Government’s flagship welfare policies. The Liberal Democrats demanded significant changes to the spare room subsidy, under which tenants with more bedrooms than they need see their housing benefit reduced. The change of heart is being seen as a Lib Dem tactic to woo Ed Miliband in the run-up to the 2015 election – and a desperate attempt to overturn months of appalling poll ratings. But Labour condemned the move, pointing out that the Tories were only able to introduce the subsidy, dubbed the ‘bedroom tax’ by critics, thanks to Lib Dem votes in the Commons. Tories said they were baffled by the change of heart, saying the Lib Dems had never argued against the measure in private. And it emerged last night that the Lib Dems had been given the chance in March to soften the impact of the ‘bedroom tax’. BBC’s Newsnight programme reported that options were drawn up by civil servants and presented to both coalition parties that would have allowed councils to cushion the impact of benefit cuts under the policy to help people struggling. But the Lib Dems apparently ignored the suggestion. Under the controversial reform, introduced in April 2013, social housing tenants deemed to  have more bedrooms than they need have had their housing benefit reduced, to tackle what the Government calls a ‘spare room subsidy’. But a government review published this week showed that almost 60 per cent of households affected by the benefit changes were in arrears as a result. And a shortage of smaller homes meant just 4.5 per cent of tenants had been able to downsize to avoid it. Unveiling the U-turn yesterday, Lib Dem Cabinet minister Danny Alexander did not call for the bedroom tax to be scrapped – but said it should be reformed so that no one faces a benefit cut if there is no suitable smaller property available. In addition, he said all disabled claimants should be exempt. Scroll down for video . The Lib Dem change of heart is being seen as a tactic to woo Ed Miliband, pictured, in the run-up to the 2015 election . Mr Clegg has been under pressure to join Labour in opposing the policy since the Lib Dem conference voted overwhelmingly to commit the party to the review of what activists called a ‘reprehensible and evil’ move. Mr Alexander said the issue would be raised with the Tories ahead of George Osborne’s Autumn Statement but if the Lib Dems are not able to secure agreement within government it will be ‘one of the key things in our election manifesto’. Rejecting the accusation of hypocrisy, he said: ‘We are part of the Government and the principle is the right one, which is that people should be paid housing benefit according to the number of rooms that they need. Then and now: Deputy PM Nick Clegg's change of heart over the spare bedroom subsidy . ‘This is about how that policy is applied in practice. It’s about listening to the evidence and significantly adjusting the policy in the light of that evidence.’ Labour’s welfare spokesman Rachel Reeves said: ‘This is unbelievable hypocrisy from Nick Clegg. There wouldn’t be a bedroom tax if it wasn’t for the Lib Dems.’ Mr Cameron’s official spokesman said the Lib Dem shift had not been discussed with the  Premier or the Chancellor. But Mr Clegg told LBC Radio it was ‘baloney’ for the Tories to claim they were surprised. ‘I’ve been constantly badgering away within government, with the Department for Work and Pensions, to try to make sure we really stress-test this properly.’","Nick Clegg is accused of 'unbelievable hypocisy' over spare room subsidy .

"By . Daniel Martin, Whitehall Correspondent . MPs should be sent on ‘honesty’ classes to ensure they adhere to ethical standards while in public office, the sleaze watchdog said last night. The Committee on Standards in Public Life said all new MPs must undergo an induction programme to drill into them the ‘seven principles of public life’. These principles, drawn up in the 1990s, state that all those in public office should abide by standards of selflessness, integrity, objectivity, accountability, openness, honesty and leadership. Lord Bew said ethics classes would be needed all the more if Parliament passes a Recall Bill, under which members of the public would be able to expel an MP if they are deemed to have fallen short . The rules were drawn up following allegations that MPs were receiving cash to ask questions in the House of Commons. But they did not prevent scandals such as MPs’ expenses, leading to fears that more needs to be done to instil into MPs their responsibilities. The chairman of the committee, Lord Bew, said he was concerned that only small numbers of MPs ever turned up at induction courses which are currently offered on ethical standards. After the last election in 2010, fewer than one in five new MPs attended induction meetings, and one workshop on dealing with ethical dilemmas had to be cancelled due to poor take-up. Lord Bew said that all new MPs should have to go on them. He said ethics classes would be needed all the more if Parliament passes a Recall Bill, under which members of the public would be able to expel an MP if they are deemed to have fallen short. In his report, Ethics in Practice, Lord Bew also called for special advisers – senior political aides to ministers – to be sent on the courses. Awareness and understanding of the Seven Principles of Public Life cannot be left to chance,’ he said. ‘We need to make sure that all of those in public life are aware of their ethical responsibilities and are prepared to act as ethical leaders. The public expects nothing less. ‘Of particular concern to us was the reported lack of engagement with induction by large numbers of Members of Parliament. ‘With the prospect of a Recall Bill, which will give the public the power to remove MPs who have behaved in ways that fall short of the standards expected of them, the stakes have never been higher. The  man in the white suit: former independent MP Martin Bell thinks that MPs should be forced to undergo classes in honesty . In effect, ethical issues will now be under even greater scrutiny. ‘More than ever, MPs need to be fully aware of the principles and the rules that guide their behaviour; Parliament and the political parties need to provide the opportunities for them to build that awareness and understanding. ‘An induction programme that fully embraces ethical standards should be the first of those opportunities.’ The Hansard Society, a constitutional think tank, said officials estimated that just 19 per cent of new members had attended at least one session of the induction programme in 2010. Attendance rarely rises above six MPs at any one time, and one workshop on ethical dilemmas had to be cancelled altogether. Some MPs are against the induction classes, telling the Hansard Society: ‘The executive would like to train members of parliament. It absolutely mustn’t happen.’ But former MP and BBC journalist Martin Bell said last night: ‘I think it’s a good idea. ‘It doesn’t have to be very long or complicated, but it’s a good way to make sure that they don’t break the rules.’","Committee on Standards in Public Life .

"By . Daniel Martin, Whitehall Correspondent . Income tax and national insurance could be merged if the Tories win the general election, it was reported last night. George Osborne was said to have considered the proposal as part of the recent Budget, and it was suggested he was now looking to put it in his party’s manifesto ahead of the general election. However, the claims were immediately denied by Treasury sources last night. Scheme: George Osborne is said to have considered a proposal to merge income tax and national insurance . Some senior Tories believe rolling together the opaque national insurance system with income tax would remind people of the scale of the tax contribution they make. Supporters of the reform believe that it would increase popular pressure to bring taxes down. The Chancellor has long considered national insurance a ‘stealth tax’ because it can be raised without uproar. However, the move would involve merging two computer systems, and could cause another Whitehall IT disaster – leading to problems similar to those that have beset universal credit. Benefits: Some senior Tories believe rolling together the opaque national insurance system with income tax would remind people of the scale of the tax contribution they make . A source told The Times: ‘We came within a whisker of doing this at the last budget, but in the end we decided against it. ‘They are currently on two separate computer systems and we thought the risk was just too great. But it’s something we could do in the next Parliament.’ But last night a Treasury source said there were no plans at all to merge the two types of tax, and discussions had not taken place about it being part of the Conservative manifesto for next year.","George Osborne said to have considered the proposal as part of budget .

"By . Daniel Martin, Whitehall Correspondent . Britain has become a ‘neglectful society’ in which families fail to look after their elderly relatives, a minister has said. Norman Lamb said it was getting to the stage where the state will be unable to cope with soaring numbers of elderly people. The care services minister said the country would have to rely on armies of volunteers to step in to help and look after vulnerable and lonely pensioners. Contact the Elderly say the number of lonely pensioners aged over 75  was higher than any time in the charity's 50 year history . The intervention came as a charity warned that tens of thousands of older people are trapped in ‘loneliness hot spots’ – so much so that social isolation for the most vulnerable in society has reached a ‘state of emergency’. Trevor Lyttleton, chairman of Contact the Elderly, said the number of lonely pensioners aged 75 or older was at higher than at any time since he founded the charity almost 50 years ago. Some go whole weeks without any human contact, and more than 1,200 people are on the waiting list to join the charity’s monthly tea parties which provide almost the only contact many pensioners have with the outside world. Last week, the problem of loneliness was highlighted when the body of a woman in her seventies was found in her Bournemouth flat, where it had remained undiscovered for six years. Anne Leitrim had not been seen since 2008 and neighbours simply assumed she had moved out of the area. Mr Lamb’s comments recall those of Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who said earlier this year that Britain needed to learn from Oriental countries where families look after their elders. In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Lamb warned that in modern Britain, people rarely visit their elderly relatives – meaning there has to be a response from local communities and the society. ‘The state can’t do it on its own,’ he said. Care  Minister Norman Lamb said British families were 'neglectful' of their older relatives . Unlike Spain, where more elderly people are looked after by their families, the Lib Dem minister said the UK had ‘inadvertently become quite a neglectful society’. The minister said there was ‘an overwhelming case’ for volunteers to fill the gap left by ‘the dispersal of the extended family’. He called for a ‘21st century version of Neighbourhood Watch’ to battle isolation, which he said was a more urgent concern than crime. ‘On our very streets we have people who live on their own, who don’t see anyone and whose relatives might visit once a month or whatever, but what’s life line in between?’ he said. He said there was a limit to what families could do ‘if your mum is 400 miles away, or even in a different country’ and said there was increasingly a ‘dispersal’ of families in Britain with people going to university and getting a job. Local authorities have cut their adult social care budgets by 26 per cent in real terms over the past four years, but Mr Lamb said his call for more volunteers was not a ‘cost-cutting option’. ‘If you think about the pressure that the system’s under now, and then you think about the growth from 1.9million people with three or more conditions to 2.9million, how on earth do we manage that? It’s an existential challenge to the system. ‘If you care about sustaining the NHS, we’ve got to find ways of making that possible – we have to think more creatively than we’ve done in the past.’ Contact the Elderly warned that it was having trouble meeting tens of thousands of lonely older people in many of our cities – in particular Birmingham, Derby, Blackpool and Canterbury. Mr Lyttleton said: ‘Loneliness among older people has reached a state of emergency and must not be ignored. My mantra is, if not now, when? ‘For almost 50 years, we have been focusing on providing a cost-effective solution, yet the demand for our service has never been so high. ‘We know our formula of tea and conversation works, but we simply cannot reach out to the people that desperately need our help without increased volunteers and funding.’","Norman Lamb says UK has 'inadvertently become quite a neglectful society'

"By . Daniel Martin, Whitehall Correspondent . 'Currying favour': Paul Flynn MP accused the establishment of bribing the Scots . The British establishment was accused of ‘cynical bribery’ last night after it emerged Scots have been showered with honours in advance of the independence referendum. The number of knighthoods, CBEs, OBEs and MBEs handed to Scottish people has soared by 40 per cent over the past 18 months as the vote approaches. Historically, Scotland has been under-represented in the bi-annual awards, receiving fewer medals than would be expected for its population. But the dramatic increase has  meant that in the last three sets of honours, Scotland has been strikingly over-represented. Paul Flynn, an MP on the Commons public administration select committee, said the revelations further discredited the honours system by showing it was being used to ‘curry favour’ with the Scots. Any indication that the system is being skewed towards the Scots to sway the referendum result will cause deep unease in Buckingham Palace. The honours are handed out in the name of the Queen, who remains  above the political fray. But the lists are drawn up by committees which include politicians and civil servants. Scotland accounts for 8.6 per cent of the UK population. If awards were distributed according to population size, the same percentage of honours would go north of the border. But an analysis by the Mail has found that in the Queen’s Birthday Honours earlier this month, 10.1 per cent of awards went to Scots – much higher than would be expected, and a dramatic increase from the 7.2 per cent going to Scots 18 months before in the 2013 New Year Honours. The Queen has been careful to remain neutral ahead of the independence vote on September 18, and has reportedly refused requests by the ‘Better Together’ campaign to speak in favour of the Union, as she famously did in 1977. Last night Mr Flynn said: ‘The honours system is being used as it has always been used – to curry favours. ‘It could well be that, consciously or unconsciously, attempts have been made to curry favour with Scots, but I am sure Scots are capable of having their own honours system if they want it. The whole system is degraded – it is at best arbitrary and at worst corrupt.’ The number of honours north of the border has soared, including MBEs (pictured) Angus MacNeil, SNP MP for the Western Isles, said: ‘This 40 per cent increase in honours will be seen by many fair-minded people as a cynical bribe by Westminster politicians.’ Among the Scots to receive awards in this month’s Birthday Honours were Kath Maitland, chief executive of the Edinburgh Fringe, and entrepreneur Fraser Doherty who set up a jam business aged 14. Scottish historian Tom Devine received a knighthood, as did Ewan Brown, of trade body Scottish Financial Enterprise. Around 1,200 honours are handed out twice a year – at New Year and on the Queen’s birthday. Angus MacNeil: 'This 40 per cent increase will be seen by many people as a cynical bribe' Until 2013, Scotland was always under-represented – a fact acknowledged by the Government in November 2012. It said: ‘Wales and Northern Ireland have done better than their population size would suggest in recent lists, while Scotland has been under-represented.’ At the 2013 New Year Honours, Scotland received 88 awards out of 1,223 – just 7.2 per cent. Yet by the Birthday Honours in June 2013, Scotland received 114 awards out of 1,180. Its rate had jumped to 9.6 per cent – well above what would be justified by its population share. By the 2014 New Year Honours, Scotland was taking home 10.2 per cent of the awards – 121 out of 1,192. This fell marginally to 10.1 per cent in this month’s Birthday Honours – 116 out of 1,149. A Cabinet Office spokesman said: ‘All nominations for honours are looked at individually and entirely on merit by independent committees.’ If Scotland does vote for independence on September 18, the Scottish National Party has promised that the honours system will be retained. Alex Salmond’s party is keen to give the impression to voters that as little as possible will change if the country decides to secede. Elizabeth II will remain as Queen of Scots – and continue to award honours. But details about how this might operate are sketchy to say the least. At the moment, the devolved government in Scotland can put people forward for awards. These are then considered by officials in London. After independence, London would  be taken out of the picture and honours would be an entirely  Edinburgh-based decision. So it is likely that, rather than announcing a UK-wide list of honours as at the moment, Buckingham Palace would announce two sets – one for Scotland, and one for the rest of the UK. However, the SNP is still yet to work out exactly what would happen to honours for Scottish people if the country opts for independence. The Scottish government’s official website of referendum questions and answers says that it will ‘agree with the Royal Household any amendments to the Honours system to reflect Scotland’s independence’.","Number of top honours handed to Scots has soared 40% in 18 months .

"By . Daniel Martin, Whitehall Correspondent . David Cameron will today announce plans to cut red tape and increase funding to find new treatments for dementia . David Cameron will today call for Britain to lead the fight against dementia, amid fears the number living with the disease in the UK will soar to two million by 2050. Describing dementia as ‘one of the greatest enemies of humanity’, the Prime Minister will pledge to slash red tape and increase funding to find new treatments to slow the onset of the disease, or even beat it altogether by 2025. Last night a charity warned that if nothing improves, the number of over-60s living with Alzheimer’s and related conditions will more than double from 800,000 to two million over the next 35 years, putting a huge strain on the NHS and social services. Dementia costs our economy up to £21billion a year in treatment costs and lost productivity. Mr Cameron will claim that  a ‘big, bold, global push’ is needed to make up for years of underinvestment. At a health summit in London, he will pledge to  fast-track research, insisting: ‘We have to fight to cure it.’ At least five times more is spent on cancer research than dementia worldwide, and only three new dementia drugs have come on to the market in the last 15 years. Professor Martin Knapp, from the London School of Economics, said discovering a treatment to delay the onset of dementia by just 36 months would save the country as much as £5billion a year. Mr Cameron will claim there is a ‘market failure’, with scientists and drug companies having no incentive to prioritise dementia research. His proposals include measures to ensure patients can get access to dementia drugs more quickly by leapfrogging the usual clinical trials process, along with moves to bring down the cost of medicines. As well as increasing funding for research, he will call for an extension of patents for dementia drugs to ensure it is worthwhile for pharmaceutical firms to invest, and more collaboration between different countries through a new global fund. The UK’s Medical Research Council is also planning the world’s biggest study into dementia involving two million people. Mr Cameron will say: ‘Dementia now stands alongside cancer as one of the greatest enemies of humanity. The number of over-60s living with Alzheimer's, pictured above, and . related conditions will more than double to 2m over the next 35 years, . according to The Alzheimer's Society . ‘We have to fight to cure it. I know some people will say that it’s not possible, but we have seen with cancer what medicine can achieve.’ The Prime Minister announced last year that British investment in tackling dementia will be doubled to £122million by 2025. The Alzheimer’s Society also confirmed a pledge to spend £100million in ten years on research. An analysis by the charity, published last night, predicts there could be as many as two million people with dementia by 2050, but that the number of sufferers could be dramatically reduced with better drugs. Dr Dennis Gillings, who was appointed by Mr Cameron as ‘world dementia envoy’ in February, will tell the conference: ‘Dementia is a ticking bomb costing the global economy £350billion and yet progress with research is achingly slow. ‘Just as the world came together in the fight against HIV/AIDS, we need to free up regulation so that we can test ground-breaking new drugs.’","Cameron describes dementia as 'one of the greatest enemies of humanity'

"By . Daniel Martin, Whitehall Correspondent . The brother-in-law of a Tory minister has donated £816,000 to her party since she became an MP, it emerged last night. Andrea Leadsom, the financial services minister, said she had no idea her relative, offshore banker Peter de Putron, had given the money. But last night a Labour MP said the payments raised questions about a possible ‘cash for political office’ arrangement. MP Andrea Leadsom, whose brother-in-law donated £816,00 to the Conservative party since she was elected . Mr de Putron, a banker who lives in Guernsey, is married to Mrs Leadsom’s sister Hayley. He has also made donations totalling £1million to a political campaign backed by the Tories and to a Right-wing think-tank. Although donations to British politicians from the Channel Islands are banned, the Leadsom payments were legally permissible because they were made through UK-registered companies. A spokesman for Mrs Leadsom, the MP for South Northamptonshire, told the Guardian she was unaware of the donations made by a member of her own family. The former banker was promoted earlier this year and became a member of George Osborne’s team. She was first elected in 2010. Labour MP Tom Watson said: 'Most reasonable people will expect Andrea Leadsom to rid herself of the suspicion that she might be the beneficiary of a 'cash for office' arrangement . Mr de Putron wrote out cheques to the Conservative party totalling £200,000 in 2010, £66,600 in 2011, £129,800 in 2012, and £204,760 in 2013. They were made via a company called Gloucester Research. Smaller sums were also made to her local constituency party. Mr de Putron also made smaller payments directly to Mrs Leadsom to hire staff, as well as £300,000 to the Conservative-backed ‘no to voting reform’ campaign, and a total of £680,000 to Open Europe, a think-tank which wants to see reform of the EU. The details emerged following a leak of the identities of thousands of wealthy offshore clients who bank with a major Channel Isles private bank. A US non-profit news organisation, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, has obtained records of more than 20,000 names. The leaks show many Jersey loopholes used by wealthy Britons to pass on their fortunes appear to have been perfectly legal. Both the Tories and to a lesser extent Labour have benefited from political donations by such individuals. Not only was the main company concerned in the donations controlled by Mrs Leadsom’s brother-in-law, but her husband, Ben, is a director. A spokesman for the MP said: ‘Andrea was not aware of the size of donations made by UK companies controlled by Peter de Putron to the  Conservative party, and has never been involved in any way.’ He added: ‘She has not benefited personally from these donations and does not believe they have affected her career.’ But Labour MP Tom Watson said: ‘This doesn’t look right. ‘Most reasonable people will expect Andrea Leadsom to rid herself of the suspicion that she might be the beneficiary of a “cash for office” arrangement.’","Brother-in-law of MP Andrea Leadsom donated £816,00 to Conservatives .

"By . Daniel Martin, Whitehall Correspondent . The IMF was yesterday forced to admit it had been wrong to criticise George Osborne over his austerity programme. Last year the Fund said the Chancellor’s cuts in public spending were acting as a ‘drag on growth’ – adding that the UK was a long way from recovery. But yesterday chief Christine Lagarde said the IMF had ‘underestimated the growth of the economy’ and the UK would actually be the fastest-growing economy in the advanced world in 2014. Apology: IMF chief Christine Lagarde (left) yesterday admitted the Fund had been wrong to criticise George Osborne (right) over his austerity programme. She said it had 'underestimated the growth of the economy' Miss Lagarde said: ‘I’m happy to come back yet again and say clearly we underestimated the growth of the UK economy in our growth forecast a year ago. ‘The only consolation I would have is that we are not alone, and I think that pretty much all forecasters at the time had the same underestimation of the success of the rebuilding of confidence.’ Last year, the IMF caused consternation in the Treasury when asserting that Government cuts were harming the prospects for the economy. It also warned that Britain was ‘still a long way from a strong and sustainable recovery’. But over the past year the economy has recovered and the IMF has since upgraded forecasts four times in a row. Support: Mr Osborne, pictured with Miss Lagarde, said the International Monetary Fund had given 'unequivocal support to our economic plan', adding: 'The British economy is firing on all cylinders' The organisation’s annual health check for 2014 said the British economy will probably grow by 2.9 per cent this year and declared the latest plans to strengthen public finances would not ‘put an undue drag on growth’.

"By . Daniel Martin, Whitehall Correspondent . The failure of the political elite to understand public concern over immigration is fuelling mounting anger among voters, sociologists have found. The widening ‘disconnect’ between Westminster’s ‘liberal political class’ and the views of the public has contributed to the rise of UKIP, according to the annual British Social Attitudes survey. Persistent public anxiety over high levels of immigration is something the mainstream parties ignore at their peril, it concluded. Homeless: Romanian migrants sleeping rough in Park Lane, central London. The annual British Social Attitudes survey has said the gap between the liberal elite and the rest of the country is fuelling tensions . The survey found that fewer Britons now support the idea of multiculturalism than a decade ago. Increasing numbers say being born in the UK or having ‘British ancestry’ are important elements of a British identity. And, when asked about what makes people ‘truly British’, 95 per cent of the survey’s participants said speaking English was an important factor – up from 85 per cent in 2003. The results follow a decade of mass immigration into the UK since restrictions were lifted on Eastern Europeans. There are now some 2.5million more foreign-born British residents than a decade ago, including around a million from Poland and the seven other countries that joined in 2004. Nigel Farage’s UKIP came top in the European elections and second in the Newark by-election, in part over concerns about immigration and EU rules that keep Britain’s borders open. Metropolitan class: There is a 'disconnect' between the rest of the public and Westminster, said the report . More than eight out of ten people now support a major tightening of rules on access to benefits and curbs on overall immigration. The British Social Attitudes survey, which has been carried out every year for 30 years, pointed out the EU rules make it ‘very hard’ for the Government to cut the numbers coming here. It said: ‘There is a clear, and intense, demand for action on the issue from one section of the electorate, a demand politicians ignore at their peril. ‘Yet responding to the concerns of the voters worried about immigration today risks alienating the rising sections of the electorate whose political voice will become steadily louder in elections to come.’ The survey found that 47 per cent believe immigration has had a negative economic impact, compared with only 31 per cent who see it as positive. Some 45 per cent said they thought immigration had ‘undermined British cultural life’, while 35 per cent said it had enriched British culture. The report said: ‘Policymakers and the interest groups they deal with regularly tend to be drawn heavily from the liberal end of the spectrum, creating a potential for disconnect and distrust between a more liberal political class which accepts immigration and an electorate among whom many find it intensely threatening. Fox in the Westminster hen house: Fears over immigration have helped the fortunes of parties such as Ukip . ‘This combination of persistent public anxiety, the disconnect in attitudes between political elites and voters, and constraints on policymakers’ ability to respond have helped to fuel the rise in support for UKIP. ‘In many areas of migration policy, constraints on current policy mean it is more liberal than even the most pro-immigration parts of the public would like, generating widespread public discontent which is hard to address. For example, EU rules make it very hard for the Government to restrict migrant numbers, or regulate migrant access to the welfare state, in accordance with the wishes of most of the public.’ Labour MP Frank Field said the report represented a ‘huge condemnation’ of politicians’ policies on immigration and said it would be unforgivable for them to respond. ‘One of the things we must do  in drawing up our red and  blue lines for renegotiating in Europe is that we have to have control of our borders again,’ he said. The political elite has been accused for years of not taking public concerns about immigration seriously – often dismissing such fears as ‘racist’. Most famously, during the last election Gordon Brown was caught on tape accusing a woman of being a ‘bigot’ because she asked him about Eastern European immigrants. Last month, Tory defence minister Anna Soubry said some of her constituents who raised immigration with her were ‘frankly racist’.","Gap between urban elite and rest of Britain helps Ukip, says annual study .

"By . Daniel Martin, Whitehall Correspondent . More than half of local authorities in England currently inform parents if their children are fat (picture posed by model) Parents should be phoned up and told their child is too fat, according to guidance published by an official health watchdog. Public Health England suggests school nurses should contact the parents of overweight children and offer them advice on how to help them lose weight through better nutrition and more exercise. The scheme – derided by critics as ‘intrusive’ – has already been quietly implemented in more than half of local authorities in England. It comes as another health agency, NICE, says the overweight or obese should be prescribed free Weight Watchers sessions on the NHS. On Tuesday the quango advised GPs to offer patients the 12-week slimming courses, which cost around £100. But yesterday an obesity expert said paying for the courses short term would not work because people would simply pile on the pounds as soon as it stopped. Tam Fry, from the National Obesity Forum, said: ‘If there was a guaranteed certainty that people would continue to lose weight, then I would be right behind it – but I really do believe they will not.’ Yesterday, the Daily Mail reported on how GPs were being advised to offer Weight Watchers classes to obese patients . The latest plan to combat childhood . obesity is contained in official guidance to schools, local councils and . the NHS on the controversial national child measurement programme, . under which children are weighed at school. The child measurement programme has . drawn criticism in the past from parents of children as young as four . who have received letters telling them their child must go on a diet. British girls are the fattest in Europe – almost a third are overweight or obese, says a study. Girls under 20 top a league table of 22 nations in Western Europe, with 29.2 per cent being overweight and obese. Of those 8 per cent of the girls meet the clinical definition of obesity, having a Body Mass Index of 30 or above. Older British women are also battling the pounds with 57 per cent classified as fat – third highest after Iceland and Malta. Estimates from a global study for 2013 found 66.6 per cent of men in the UK are fat. This places them fifth in the European league table. An estimated 26 per cent of British boys under 20 are overweight and obese – placing them 10th. The report from the US-based Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, published in The Lancet, says there has been an  increase in obese children in developed countries. But the rise in adult obesity has slowed down. The latest guidance suggests parents whose children are identified as underweight, overweight or obese could receive a ‘follow-up’ phone call, to offer them ‘personalised advice and services to help control their child’s weight’ – such as referral to a slimming club. The guidance warns the school nurse must use a ‘sensitive, motivational approach’ so that parents do not feel that their parenting skills are being criticised. Last night, parents’ groups hit back at the guidance – saying it was up to mothers and fathers and not the nanny state to decide what children should eat. Margaret Morrissey, of pressure group Parents Out Loud, said: ‘Labelling children, contacting parents, being Big Brother doesn’t help. What would be more useful, rather than lecturing, would be removing the temptation of large packets of sweets from supermarket shelves.’ Norman Wells, from Family and Youth . Concern, said: ‘While it is a laudable aim to encourage healthy eating . and physical exercise from a young age, interventions that parents . perceive to be undermining their role and interfering with family life . are unlikely to be effective.’ But the . advice was backed by the National Obesity Forum which said school nurses . could provide positive information on nutrition. Latest . figures from the classroom weigh-ins show that 9.3 per cent of children . in reception class (aged four or five) are obese, meaning they are so . fat their health is in danger. In the final year of primary school (age . ten or 11), the proportion of obese children has risen to 18.9 per cent. Dr . Ann Hoskins, of PHE, said the phone calls were already taking place in . 56 per cent of local authority areas. She added: ‘The National Child . Measurement Programme is crucial in monitoring the progress of on-going . work to tackle childhood obesity locally and nationally.’ GPs have been advised to offer obese people 12-week Weight Watchers courses costing £100 .","More than half of local authorities in England warn parents if their child is overweight .

"By . Daniel Martin, Whitehall Correspondent . Warning: IMF chief Christine Lagarde urged Chancellor George Osborne to take action to prevent a property bubble posing a risk to the economy . Britain should relax planning laws to build more houses on green field sites, impose VAT on food and raise interest rates to protect the recovery, said the International Monetary Fund. The global financial watchdog warned the Chancellor that rate rises and a sharp increase in new housing were needed to prevent a property bubble posing a risk to the economy. And it suggested that, to reduce public debt, VAT could be levied for the first time on books, children’s clothes and more types of food. The intervention infuriated Tory MPs, who said Britain’s tax and planning policies were nothing to do with the IMF, or its head Christine Lagarde. ‘We elect our own government to decide on our budget thank you very much,’ said Douglas Carswell, Tory MP for Clacton. Miss Lagarde said the Bank of England should start to put up interest rates and take measures to clamp down on risky mortgages. And she called for ‘unnecessary’ restrictions on building on greenfield sites to be lifted, so the supply of houses can be increased. This, she said, would help stabilise prices. In addition, the IMF’s annual economic health check for Britain said the Government could better tackle debt by reducing the scope of products and services that are zero-rated for VAT. The IMF lecture comes just days after the European Commission called on Mr Osborne to boost economic growth by imposing higher taxes and new levies on expensive homes. The IMF’s report urged ministers to consider an early end to the Help to Buy scheme offering mortgage guarantees and loans for those struggling to find a deposit. In response, the Chancellor said the UK would ‘remain vigilant’ for any risks that might emerge from the housing market. Action: The IMF said Britain should relax planning laws to build more houses on green field sites, impose VAT on food and raise interest rates to protect the recovery. Above, Miss Lagarde is pictured with Mr Osborne . George Osborne earlier told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme the Bank ‘should not hesitate’ to take action if the housing market poses a risk to the economy. David Cameron’s hopes of stopping an arch-federalist taking the reins of the EU have suffered a blow after Miss Lagarde ruled herself out as a compromise candidate. She insisted: ‘I am not a candidate. I have a job.’ Mr Cameron has made clear his opposition to front-runner Jean-Claude Juncker, the ex-Luxembourg prime minister.

"By . Daniel Martin, Whitehall Correspondent . Jeremy Hunt was accused of being a ‘snake-oil salesman’ last night after it emerged he asked the Chief Medical Officer to review the medical effectiveness of homeopathy. The Health Secretary asked Dame Sally Davies to look at three studies, funded by the homeopathy industry, which found the controversial therapy could help fight disease. The British Medical Association has derided homeopathy as ‘witchcraft’, and most scientists dismiss it as a placebo. Jeremy Hunt, pictured, has been accused of being a 'snake-oil salesman' after it emerged he asked for a review into the medical effectiveness of homeopathy . Emails show Mr Hunt asked Dame Sally to report on the studies, which were funded by French firm Boiron, the world’s largest manufacturer of homeopathic products. Mr Hunt has in the past spoken favourably about homeopathy, in which massively diluted ingredients are supposed to cure serious illnesses. But last night a source close to him denied he believed in the practice. ‘Jeremy is not a supporter of homeopathy and is not persuaded that there is any scientific evidence that it works,’ he said. Dame Sally said none of them were robust enough to provide strong evidence that homeopathy is effective. Labour said Mr Hunt should not have wasted NHS time and money on the issue. Jamie Reed, the party’s health spokesman, said: ‘Put a snake-oil salesman in charge of the NHS and this is the inevitable result.’ ‘As staff shortages affect patient care, . A&E units continue to miss their targets and people struggle to see . their GP, patients and medical professionals will be dismayed but not . surprised to learn that one of Jeremy Hunt’s first acts as Health . Secretary was to waste time and money on investigating studies into . homeopathy. ‘The government’s . own NHS Choices website states that the evidence for homeopathy is . ‘scientifically implausible’ but this doesn’t appear to be enough for . the error-prone Health Secretary. 'As his policies continue to damage the . NHS, I hope he hasn’t ordered an investigation into the use of . leeches.’ Jamie Reed, pictured, Labour's health spokesman, accused Jeremy Hunt of being a 'snake-oil salesman' Homeopathy claims to treat and prevent disease by using greatly diluted forms of herbs and minerals. It is based on the principle that ‘like cures like’ - that an illness can be treated by substances that produce similar symptoms. For example, homeopaths claim that onions, which make eyes itchy and tearful, can be used to relieve the symptoms of hay fever. But both the British Medical Association and the Commons science and technology committee say the NHS should stop funding homeopathic treatments because of a lack of evidence they work. The BMA has described homeopathy as ‘witchcraft’, and last summer the Advertising Standards Authority said homeopaths were putting people’s lives at risk by discouraging them from seeking medical treatment. Last month an Australian study concluded that homeopathy was no more effective than placebo. In a 2007 letter to a constituent, Mr Hunt said ‘homeopathic care is enormously valued by thousands of people’ and should continue to be available on England’s health service. Both the British Medical Association and the Commons science and technology committee say the NHS should stop funding homeopathic treatments because of a lack of evidence they work . In the same year, he signed a Commons motion welcoming the ‘positive contribution made to the health of the nation by the NHS homeopathic hospitals’. And last year he held a private meeting with Prince Charles, who urged him to ensure alternative medicines will be available on the NHS. Emails obtained by the BuzzFeed website show that in December, Mr Hunt asked Dame Sally to review three studies on the medical benefits of homeopathy. In an email to a third party, the Health Secretary’s office argued it was ‘important we do not discount different methods of treatment if they prove to be effective’ and said it would continue to pass on other studies regarding the medical benefits of homeopathy to the chief medical officer. The Chief Medical Officer reviewed the three studies forwarded by Hunt and concluded there were fundamental problems with their scientific method. According to emails, Dame Sally found that it was ‘difficult to draw useful conclusions’ from two of the trials, though Mr Hunt’s office noted that the analysis had found they were ‘well-designed, with robust results’. The chief medical officer also said the third trial, into the homeopathic treatment of patients with musculoskeletal disorders, had problems because it was not scientifically randomised and had a ‘relatively low response rate’. A Department of Health spokesperson said the department does not maintain an official position on homeopathy, and that decisions about use of alternative treatments should be made at a local level. ‘It is the responsibility of local NHS organisations to make decisions on the commissioning and funding of any healthcare treatments for NHS patients, such as homeopathy,’ the spokesman said.","Jeremy Hunt accused of being a 'snake-oil salesman' over homeopathy review .

"By . Daniel Martin, Whitehall Correspondent . In a speech in Estonia, Liam Fox (file pic), called Putin's government 'bullying and thuggish' and said the West's failure to act has encouraged him . The West must take a much tougher line against Vladimir Putin - otherwise no country with a Russian population will be safe, Liam Fox warned last night. The former Defence Secretary said Putin’s government was a ‘bullying and thuggish regime’, but David Cameron and other leaders had been weak in tackling him. In a strongly-worded speech in Estonia, he criticised the US and Europe for doing little more than threatening to suspend Russia from the G8 group of major nations - saying it should be permanently expelled. He also called for Nato air defences to be permanently beefed up to protect the Baltic republics, and said any planned sales of weaponry should be scrapped. ‘We must be firm in our response to this challenge to international law,’ he said. ‘This must be seen as the point where we fundamentally reassessed our attitude to the Putin government. ‘This cannot be a suspension of the G8. It must be the end of the G8 until there is a profound change in Russian behaviour. ‘The beefing up of Baltic air defences must be permanent, not temporary. Nato exercises must become more extensive and frequent and we must halt defence exports to Russia, including the 1.2billion euro French warship order.’ He added: ‘Make no mistake, this is an expansionist Russia echoing its imperialist past.’ Russia annexed the Ukrainian province of Crimea last month, and is accused of stirring up nationalist sentiment in the east of the country. Dr Fox said the West’s failure to act against Putin in the past had encouraged him. They did little to punish him for his invasion of Georgia, or the cyber attack on Estonia - and the US failure to oppose Assad’s aggression in Syria led Putin to draw the ‘obvious’ conclusions. Fox said Putin's actions represented 'an expansionist Russia echoing its imperialist past' Russia seized control of the Ukrainian province of Crimea in March and has since been accused of stirring up anti-Western sentiment in the east of the country (file pic) ‘For too long, the serial bad behaviour of Putin’s Russia has been ignored,’ he said. ‘The strong desire to see Russia develop as a pluralistic democratic society has allowed wishful thinking to take the place of critical analysis on far too many occasions. ‘What we are witnessing in Ukraine today is not a new Russian pattern of behaviour. 'We have seen a former KGB officer, who views the world in the same way the old Soviet Union did, biding his time until he perceived the balance of power tip his way and he has been well rewarded for his wait as the West fails to deliver on some of the most important issues of the day.’ He added: ‘Putin watched the reaction of the West while he bullied Ukraine over the supply and price of Russian gas and he saw that we did nothing. ‘Putin’s government is a bullying and thuggish regime. Russia has ruthlessly deployed its gas exports as a strategic weapon. 'Just as a drug dealer gets their addict hooked and can then demand any price they like, Putin had no qualms about exploiting the weakness of neighbouring energy-dependent states.’ Fox also took a swipe at Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond, saying he is 'astonished and appalled' whenever a Western politician speaks of their admiration for Putin . Dr Fox said Russia was already eying up the Serb part of Bosnia, and could also seek to increase its influence in the Arctic. He also suggested Putin would use oligarchs’ money to influence elections in Russia’s near neighbours. ‘Putin has observed weak Western leadership, with electorates tired of external conflicts after Iraq and Afghanistan, neglecting their outside space and too focused on increasingly internal short-term interests,’ he said. ‘We must be firm in our response to this challenge to international law. This must be seen as the point where we fundamentally reassessed our attitude to the Putin government.’ In a swipe at Scottish first minister Alex Salmond, he said: ‘I am astonished and appalled when I hear Western politicians talk about their admiration for Putin.’","Liam Fox called Putin's government 'a bullying and thuggish regime'

"By . Daniel Martin, Whitehall Correspondent . Remark: Sir Edward Grey (pictured) said 'the lamps are going out all over Europes; we will not see them lit again in our lifetime' Britons will be asked to turn off their lights to mark the 100th anniversary of the moment war was declared in 1914. The Lights Out project is inspired by then foreign secretary Sir Edward Grey’s remark at the outbreak of the First World War that: ‘The lamps are going out all over Europe, we shall not see them lit again in our lifetime.’ The event, at 11pm on August 4, is part of a nationwide series of works announced yesterday by Culture Secretary Maria Miller. Planners are hailing it as ‘one of the most dramatic UK-wide events ever organised’ in which ‘people from all four nations will be invited to turn off their lights and to replace them with one single light to remember a day that changed the world forever’. They have not said how long the switch-off will last. Germany declared war on France and invaded Belgium on August 3, 1914. That evening, Sir Edward Grey gazed across St James’s Park from his window at the Foreign Office as the lamps were being lit on the Mall and made his now famous remark to a friend, John Spender. Other plans for the 14-18 NOW programme include a one-off Proms performance where the work of war poets will be set to music, four specially written songs by guitarist Richard Thompson and an online war memorial with contributions from the public. Mrs Miller said: ‘Ensuring a cultural element flows throughout the centenary will be a vital part of our commemorations, particularly as a way of engaging young people and helping them make that connection with the past. ‘The programme will help all of us to pause in remembrance and to understand the resonance of the First World War today.’ Other activities include a theatrical re- telling of the story of the Liverpool Pals regiment. Two ships, one in dry dock in Liverpool and another on the Thames, will be painted in the style of the dazzle ships which were camouflaged with complex patterns of geometric shapes that made them difficult to track. Commemoration: Events will also include a concert at London's Royal Albert Hall . The late night prom at the Royal Albert Hall will see German composer Torsten Rasch and the Philharmonia Orchestra perform a 40-minute work featuring verse by writers including Robert Frost, Edward Thomas and Rupert Brooke. The performance on August 4 will be followed by Lights Out where people will be invited to turn off their lights and replace them with a single light including specially-commissioned digital light works which will be available to download for free. Project director Jenny Waldman said: ‘We are commissioning some of the world’s leading artists to respond to the events of the First World War and the wider social political, cultural and scientific developments of the period. ‘And to respond with a contemporary perspective - to explore the resonance of the First World War today. I am particularly delighted about the way artists have responded to the brief and the wonderful enthusiasm our cultural organisations have shown in their support for the programme.’","Lights Out project was inspired by remark by foreign secretary Edward Grey .

"By . Daniel Martin, Whitehall Correspondent . Proposal: The unemployed could be made to clean war memorials in return for their benefits, David Cameron announced last night. Above, a worker cleans London's Cenotaph . The unemployed could be made to clean war memorials in return for their benefits, David Cameron announced last night. As part of a new drive to get those who have been jobless for more than six months back to work, claimants may be told to report for community and charity work. They could be offered work as gardeners or told to help restore historical sites, giving them the skills to hold down a full-time job. If they refuse to co-operate, they would lose all or part of their jobseeker’s allowance. The plans are part of the Help to Work scheme, which comes into force today.  It is targeted at those who have been out of work for months and are having no luck getting a job – or deemed not to be trying hard enough. Job centre staff will be able to put people on the scheme and could force them to turn up every day to discuss what they have done to look for work. Until now, these meetings have happened no more frequently than every two weeks. Mr Cameron said: ‘A key part of our long-term economic plan is to move to full employment, making sure that everyone who can work is in work. We are seeing record levels of employment in Britain, as more and more people find a job, but we need to look at those who are persistently stuck on benefits. 'This scheme will provide more help than ever before, getting people into work and on the road to a more secure future.’ There are currently more than 600,000 job vacancies in the UK at any one time. The new measures are designed to ensure that as the economy improves, everyone with the ability to work has the support and the opportunity to do so. Under the . scheme, job centre advisors will tailor back-to-work plans for each . claimant. Those put on Help to Work will have to turn up at the job . centre every day for a meeting with their adviser to discuss their . progress. As part of the scheme, dole claimants who lack work experience could be put on ‘community work placements’. These . would include a range of roles in the voluntary and community sector . that will give them experience in the workplace – such as gardening . projects, running community cafes or restoring war memorials. The . placements will be for up to six months for 30 hours a week. They will . be backed by at least four hours of supported job searching each week to . help turn them into full-time employment. Other claimants could be given help with travel costs for turning up to interviews, or help to buy suitable interview clothes. Announcement: Mr Cameron said a key part of the government's long-term economic plan was 'making sure everyone who can work is in work'. He added: 'We need to look at those who are persistently stuck on benefits' Iain Duncan Smith, the Work and Pensions Secretary, said: ‘Everyone with the ability to work should be given the support and opportunity to do so. ‘The previous system wrote too many people off, which was a huge waste of potential. ‘We are now seeing record numbers of people in jobs and the largest fall in long-term unemployment since 1998. ‘But there’s always more to do, which is why we are introducing this new scheme to provide additional support to the very small minority of claimants who have been unemployed for a number of years. In this way we will ensure that they too can benefit from the improving jobs market.’ Help to Work will be mandatory. Those who fail to participate could lose their jobseeker’s allowance for four weeks for  a first failure and 13 weeks  for a second.","Unemployed could be made to clean war memorials in return for benefits .

"By . Daniel Martin, Whitehall Correspondent . Kenny MacAskill has said it will be 'for the people of Scotland to decide' if they want to keep the Queen as head of state if the country votes for independence . The Queen could be removed as head of state if Scotland votes for independence, a senior SNP minister has said. Kenny MacAskill, the Scottish justice minister, said ‘it will be for the people of Scotland to decide’ if the country becomes a republic or remains a monarchy. Alex Salmond’s official policy is that the monarchy would be automatically be retained if Scotland decides to secede - but many in his party are staunch republicans. Mr MacAskill’s intervention in support of a referendum on becoming a republic at some point after independence is achieved further undermines the First Minister’s position. A poll out this weekend shows the gap between the ‘yes’ and ‘no’ votes in the independence plebiscite has narrowed. The survey, conducted by ICM Research, found that 39 per cent would vote ‘yes’ in the referendum - an increase of two percentage points on the previous month. The percentage of ‘no’ votes fell from 49 in February to 46 per cent, leaving the proportion of ‘don’t knows’ at 15 per cent (down one percentage point on last month). It means a swing of just five per cent could see the Union dissolved when the vote takes place on 18 September. Mr Salmond’s strategy is to persuade people that not much would change if Scotland votes to leave the UK, from keeping the pound to retaining the Queen. But Mr MacAskill’s comments, in response to question about whether Scotland should become a republic, have undermined that position. At a public meeting last week, he reiterated the Scottish Government’s official position that ‘we will inherit the situation we have with the Queen as head of state in the ceremonial capacity that she has’. The minister continued: ‘But it will be for the people of Scotland to decide. If and when that would occur, if they wished to have a referendum, and we would hope we would become the government post-2016, it will be for whoever is in office then.’ Official SNP policy for the last 50 years has always been to keep the Queen as head of state, and a spokesman said MacAskill 'totally backs that policy' Until now, Mr MacAskill’s was most famous for his controversial decision to release the Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset al-Megrahi back to Libya on the basis that he was close to death with prostate cancer. In fact, he lived on for another two years and nine months. He is not the first pro-independence figure to support the abolition of the monarchy north of the border. Aileen Campbell, the Scottish children’s minister, and Fiona Hyslop, the Scottish culture minister, have also called for a post-secession referendum on keeping the Queen. Dennis Canavan, the campaign’s chairman, has said Prince George should never be King of Scots. The Scottish Government said it had been SNP policy for 50 years to keep the monarchy in an independent Scotland. ‘Kenny MacAskill backs that policy totally,’ a spokesman said. Jackson Carlaw, the Scottish Tory deputy leader, said: ‘You have to wonder whether there is truly anyone in Yes Scotland’s leadership or the SNP, other than the First Minister, who is in tune with the Scottish public’s continuing affection and support for the monarchy. ‘There is surely little doubt that whatever promises and assertions are made before the referendum they would count for nothing if Scotland were to be seduced into voting Yes. Fiona Hyslop (left), Scottish culture minister, and Aileen Campbell (right), children's minister, have also called for a referendum on having the Queen as head of state if the country votes for independence . ‘This motley alliance, including Kenny MacAskill, would then be doing all they could to pursue their minority republican views and it would be tiger whose tail even Alex Salmond would struggle to hold.’ The Scottish and English crowns were united in 1603 when Elizabeth I died without issue. She was replaced by the Scottish king James VI, who became King James I of England. A century later, in 1707, the countries politically united to form the Kingdom of Great Britain. Last night an investment firm warned that an independent Scotland faces high debt and weak economic growth. But BlackRock said fears of an exodus of banks amid nationalist anti-business sentiment were unlikely. Its report concluded that independence ‘would bring major uncertainties, costs and risks - mostly for Scotland, but also for the remaining UK’. A currency union looks ‘unfeasible’, leaving Scotland with the choice of joining the euro, which ‘does not appear to be a near term option’, or launching its own currency pegged to sterling or its other main trading partners and to the price of oil, it said.","SNP policy for 50 years has been to keep the Queen as head of state .

"By . Daniel Martin, Whitehall Correspondent . To those who find themselves barely managing to juggle their jobs, daily chores and looking after the children, it will certainly come as a far-fetched suggestion. But an official survey has found that – statistically at least – British women are the ‘leisure queens’ of Europe, who apparently enjoy more downtime than their sisters almost anywhere else in the Western world. International research suggests they spend around five and a half hours a day on leisure activities, when averaged out over the week. Women in the UK spend more time on leisure each day anywhere in the European, and are only behind Norway globally, according to a league table published by the OECD . This is behind only one country in the industrialised world – Norway. This . daily leisure time for British women includes more than two hours . watching TV or listening to the radio, according to the analysis by the . Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Even so, chaps . are hardly in a position to complain – for the figures also reveal that . British men spend even longer on leisure than women, at almost six and a . half hours. What’s more, they spend less than half as much time doing . housework than the fairer sex. Women spend most of their leisure time watching TV or listening to the radio . Women in the UK spend most of the day on personal care, including sleeping, followed by lesiure, unpaid work, and then paid work . The . analysis by the OECD, which represents the world’s 34 most . industrialised nations, draws on a decade of surveys. It shows women in . the UK spent three hours 17 minutes working or studying each day, four . hours 18 minutes in unpaid work, such as looking after children, . shopping or housework, and five hours 39 minutes on leisure. They . also found time for just under ten hours on ‘personal care’, including . eight hours 10 minutes sleeping, one hour eating and 48 minutes on . personal or medical services. An . OECD spokesman said: ‘The Northern Europeans are the queens of leisure, . with women in Norway spending more time relaxing than anyone else, . followed by the UK. When it comes to housework, women in the UK spend more washing and cleaning than any country except Mexico and India . The Chinese spend the most time on work or study, with women in the UK using 197 minutes a day on average . ‘In . virtually every country, men are able to fit in valuable extra minutes . of leisure each day while women spend more time doing unpaid housework.' Leisure was defined as including watching TV or listening to the radio, . participating in or attending events, sports and visiting and . entertaining friends. British women’s leisure time was much higher than the OECD average of four hours and 42 minutes. By . contrast, women France spend four and a half hours, a similar figure to . the US and Australia. Portugal was the lowest at three hours and 20 . minutes. Top of the table was Norway, at more than six hours. Women in the UK get less sleep than Americans, Swedes, South Africans, Italians and the Irish . The UK figures relate to 2005, the latest available. Interestingly, . when it comes to time spent on personal care, France and Italy emerged . on top, with French women spending 11 hours 44 minutes, just ahead of .

"By . Daniel Martin, Whitehall Correspondent . The NHS is probing astonishing claims GPs are billing care homes for visits that should be free. Fees paid by nursing homes are intended to cover so-called ‘enhanced’ services. But there are concerns some family doctors are demanding the payments for nothing more than basic NHS care. A Labour peer said if evidence of fraud was discovered it would be a police matter. Concern: Some GPs are charging extra to visit care homes over and above their six-figure average earnings, it has emerged in a debate on care in the House of Lords. The government is investigating the claims (file photo) It is believed some homes are passing the cost of GPs on to elderly residents, increasing the chance they will have to sell their property. Around one in ten nursing homes have paid a doctor for a visit, according to a survey by the Care Quality Commission. It was reported last month that in one case a GP requested an extra £24,000 a year to cover services for 72 elderly residents. Attack: Lord Hunt, Labour's health spokesman in the Lords, said the situation appeared to be fraud . Britain’s family doctors are already the highest paid in the Western world. Health minister Norman Lamb has asked NHS England and  the chief inspectors of GPs and social care to investigate how widespread the practice is. Officials will then consider whether action needs to be taken against rogue doctors. Many family doctors charge a fee for ‘enhanced services’ to care homes, but this is meant to cover extras such as training for nurses and  carers, or health and safety audits. Ministers say the payment should not apply to NHS care, which should be provided for free whether or not a person is in a home. Britain’s GPs enjoy an average package of £105,000 a year. Despite their huge salaries, the vast majority took advantage of the stipulation in Labour’s 2003 botched contract that they could opt out of responsibility for their patients outside office hours. The issue came to light during a House of Lords debate on healthcare provision to care homes. Baroness Jolly, speaking for the Government, said: ‘Let me be clear: GP practices should ensure that any services provided to care homes for which a retainer is charged are not those  currently provided under their contract with NHS England. ‘NHS England is responsible for ensuring that the terms of the GP contract are being met. ‘Any GPs who provide services should do so free of charge, and any money paid by care homes to practices should be for something over and above that. ‘The sort of thing that we might be thinking of is assistance with training or possibly helping out with something like a health and safety audit, but certainly not basic NHS care.’ Inflation: Prescription charges are going up again from £7.85 to £8.05, with another rise to £8.20 next year . Probe: Health minister Norman Lamb (left) said he will task staff to investigate if the practice is widespread . Liberal Democrat peer Baroness Brinton asked what the Government was doing to prevent ‘what appears to be double charging’. Lady Jolly told her: ‘The department is working with both the Care Quality Commission and NHS England to get to the bottom of this. Guidance is in the process of being written and disseminated.’ Labour’s Baroness Pitkeathley urged the Government to take further action, insisting that to charge for an ‘enhanced service’ and not provide anything extra was fraudulent. Lord Hunt, the party’s health spokesman in the Lords, added: ‘As this appears to be fraud, shouldn’t this be a matter for referral to  the police?’ Last night Ros Altmann, a former government adviser on older people, said: ‘The idea that just because someone is in a care home they should have to pay for NHS care is outrageous. ‘GPs have already got a very good pay deal and they have typically pulled out of out-of-hours. It seems utterly wrong to push this cost on to care homes, who will push the cost on to families who are already paying higher fees.’ Dr Richard Vautrey, deputy chairman of the British Medical Association’s GP committee, said: ‘All practices provide comprehensive services free of charge to all patients in care homes. ‘A very small number of practices receive extra payments … to cover the costs of providing additional services, such as regular ward rounds or assistance with staff training.’","Labour Peer Lord Hunt told Parliament the situation 'appears to be fraud'

"By . Daniel Martin, Whitehall Correspondent . Millions of people who pay their energy bills by direct debit are set to receive refunds, it will be announced today. Power firms have caved in to pressure from ministers and will hand back money to householders who are in credit on their gas and electricity. It follows criticism that the Big Six are making millions in interest by hoarding money they make when people pay too much during the year. Action: Millions of people who pay their energy bills by direct debit are set to receive refunds, it has been revealed. Power firms will hand back money to householders who are in credit on their gas and electricity . But one of the big companies – npower – has said it may not follow the other firms in refunding its customers. Energy minister Greg Barker said householders may wish to ‘vote with their feet’ and switch suppliers if npower refuses to follow suit. The energy firms will announce that they will make annual automatic refunds on balances which are more than £5 in credit, as well as reviewing customer accounts every six months. 'Excellent result': Energy minister Greg Barker said the move is 'a good step towards restoring trust in the majority of companies' The move comes after an investigation found that power firms are stockpiling up to £2billion of cash from customers. With more than 13million households paying a fixed amount every month, many are overpaying in the summer, when usage is lower – leading to huge credits on accounts. Industry experts estimated firms were making up to £36million a year in interest, leading to accusations that they were profiteering from customers. Following anger from consumers, the companies held a summit with ministers in November, at which they promised to make changes including a refund if an account was in credit by £75 or more. Further negotiation led to the amount being reduced to £5, which EDF revealed on Friday ahead of the expected joint announcement today. Mr Barker said: ‘This is an excellent result for consumers worried about energy prices, and this is a good step towards restoring trust in the majority of companies. ‘We have still a lot more work to do, but this shows Coalition ministers are capable of delivering.’ Asked about npower, he added: ‘Consumers will look at other energy firms and may well decide to vote with their feet. It is their money at the end of the day. A spokesman for npower, which has 3.5million customers in the UK, said: ‘We’re looking at this suggestion but we need to be sure it reflects what our customers want. Opting out? However, npower has said it may not follow the other firms in refunding its customers (file picture) ‘Our research strongly suggests customers want to be given a choice between a full refund today and keeping their direct debit payments down tomorrow. ‘We’ve had feedback that refunding very low amounts isn’t seen as worthwhile, and we also know many people like to keep their account in credit, as a buffer for next year’s bills. ‘However, we do automatically refund credit balances of over £60, and customers in credit can request and receive a refund at any time.’","Millions of people who pay energy bills by direct debit will receive refunds .

"By . Daniel Martin, Whitehall Correspondent . The extent to which savers have been ‘punished’ since the credit crunch was laid bare last night. Low interest rates since the 2007/08 crash have seen those who have sensibly saved throughout their lives losing thousands of pounds - while delivering a bonanza for borrowers. Research by financial expert Ros Altmann shows that someone with £100,000 in the bank has lost up to £21,000 since the start of 2008 thanks to the interest they will no longer be earning on their savings. Bank of England governor Mark Carney has suggested rates will not rise in the near future - committing savers to years' more misery . Every year, the interest income on their money is at least £4,250 lower than it would have been in December 2007, when base rates were higher. But a borrower with a £100,000 mortgage has enjoyed a bonanza since the start of 2008, saving more than £19,000 if they are on a standard variable rate deal. Mortgage repayments are now almost £3,300 a year cheaper than they would have been at the end of 2007. The differing fortunes have occurred because Bank of England base rates are now just 0.5 per cent, compared to 5.5 per cent before the downturn. Pensioners are disproportionately affected, because they are more likely to have a savings pot than a mortgage. Even though the economy is now clearly recovering, bank governor Mark Carney has suggested rates will not rise in the near future - committing savers to years’ more misery. Ms Altmann, a former adviser to the Treasury on pensions, said savers had been made the ‘sacrificial lamb’ by the government which was keen to see interest rates low in the aftermath of the credit crunch. Research by financial expert Ros Altmann shows the extent to which savers have been 'punished' since the credit crunch . And she said she was concerned that many borrowers have been lulled into a false sense of security and will not be able to afford mortgage payments once base rates eventually rise. She said: ‘Britain has always valued savers in the past, and people have always been encouraged to save. But we’re not in danger of losing that culture. 'It’s the scale of the gains and losses that is stark. It is quite staggering the enormous amounts that borrowers have gained by compared to the extent to which savers are losing out. ‘Savers have put money aside sensibly for the future, expecting to have an income in retirement. They have made careful plans so they can set aside money to give them income in retirement. 'But all their plans are up in smoke because over the past six years they have lost money month on month. ‘What has happened is that savers have been made a sacrificial lamb in order to help people borrow sums of money at record low rates.’ The research finds that a person with a £100,000 standard variable rate mortgage would have paid interest of £7,680 a year in December 2007. But now the interest stands at just £3,280 a year. This works out at a saving of £3,290 a year or £274 a month. Ms Altmann said that over the past six years that is a cumulative saving of more than £19,000. Those on tracker mortgages would save slightly less. Conversely, for someone who has £100,000 of savings in a fixed rate bonds, annual interest in December 2007 was £5,990 - but by December 2013 it had fallen to £1,440 a year. This is a loss of £4,550 a year, or £379 a month. Over the past six years it will have added up to a loss of nearly £21,000. For someone whose money is in a Cash ISA, the loss will be slightly less - around £4,260 a year.Ms Altmann added: ‘This shows that anyone with a mortgage has benefited hugely from higher incomes at the expense of those who saved and didn’t want to borrow large sums. ‘People with large mortgages have had an enormous boost to their income, whereas people who have put money aside for the future have seen income fall to support those with huge mortgages. There comes a point when you have to ask whether this is socially equitable. ‘Every society needs savers but what is happening is we are discouraging savers and giving the impression that it is just not worth borrowing, . ‘The danger for the future of the economy is that no country can survive in the long run if all we do is help borrowers and punish savers. ‘And once rates go up, many borrowers may find they cannot support the additional costs. They may have been misled on the mortgages they can afford’ It comes after a poll over Christmas found that most people - especially pensioners - want to see interest rates rise. Over all ages, more people think they will win rather than lose out from higher interest rates - a boost to David Cameron as a rate hike becomes more likely in the run-up to the next election. The YouGov survey showed that two thirds of people think an increase would either make no difference or improve their personal finances. Pensioners are particularly in favour. Some 50 per cent of the over-60s believe a rise in interest rates would make them better off - compared to just 7 per cent who say their finances would suffer. Lesley Daniels, divisional manager for Victim Support in Greater Manchester, said: ‘While we are currently assessing the extent of the help provided in this case by Victim Support, we can confirm that Tracy was given support at court through our Witness Service. ‘We know it takes real courage to come forward and make an allegation of rape and that many complainants find going through the criminal justice process a very distressing experience. However, it will be for an inquest to determine the full facts and circumstances of this tragic death.’","Base rates now 0.5 per cent, compared to 5.5 per cent before the downturn .

Thanks to our decision not to join the euro, we will overtake France in less than five years to become the fifth-largest economy in the world. In a significant boost to George Osborne’s austerity programme, the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) hailed the UK as the second-best performing economy in the Western world after the United States – and said France was one of the worst. A vision of the future? The predictions, right, could be good news for George Osborne if true. The UK is set to beat Germany and France but lose out to Brazil and India, remaining the sixth-largest world economy . Our strong currency, low taxes and the projected rise in our population – in contrast with some of our competitors – means our GDP will outstrip France by 2018 and Germany 12 years later. But competition from emerging economies means India and Brazil will overtake us by 2028, pushing us to seventh in the world  economic league table. By then, France will be only the 13th largest economy in the world – a humiliating blow to the proud nation and an indictment of current Socialist president  Francois Hollande’s policies. Unbeatable: We could not hope to rival China, partly because of its huge population . The CEBR said Britain has prospered outside the eurozone and will continue to do so, while our low taxes have promoted growth. By comparison, things are so bad in recession-hit Italy that this year the size of its economy has been exceeded by Russia. Britain avoided a double-dip recession in the wake of the 2008 global economic crisis, and has now returned steadfastly to growth. The UK’s economy is set to grow by 1.4 per cent this year – well ahead of countries struggling under the yoke of the eurozone. Last night a Treasury spokesman said the study vindicates George Osborne’s austerity programme. He said: ‘Britain’s hard work is paying off and the long-term economic plan is working. ‘The economy is growing, the deficit is falling and jobs are being created and while this report is encouraging, the job is not yet done. So the Government will go on taking the difficult decisions needed to secure a responsible recovery for all.’ The study by the CEBR looks at the 30 largest economies in the world and predicts how they will fare in the coming years. It finds that China will overtake the US as the world’s largest economy in around 2028. The report outlines how the so-called BRIC countries – Brazil, Russia, India and China – will soon start to outstrip their Western counterparts as their industrialisation takes hold. India is predicted to outstrip Japan’s . economy by 2028. Despite this exceptional rise, Britain is still giving . the country millions of pounds in aid. Hailing . the strength of Britain’s recovery, the CEBR said population growth . would be a factor in our future success. Germany, on the other hand, is . set to see its population plummet. Booming: China is expected to beat the U.S. to the top spot. Pictured: Workers at a clothing factory in Panjin . Changes: India will surge ahead but still receives British aid, while France could have grim times ahead . However, the CEBR warned that Britain’s prospects could be harmed if it fails to trade more with developing and growing countries such as China. The economists hinted that leaving the EU could also be bad for our prospects, and that if Scotland leaves the union that would hit the size of our GDP. Their report added: The factors driving the UK’s overtaking  Germany are the assumption of a falling value for the Euro, Germany’s falling population and the UK’s rising population.’ The CEBR said that by 2028, the UK economy is forecast to be only 3 per cent smaller than the German economy, meaning it is likely to become the largest Western European economy by around 2030. If the euro breaks up, the outlook for German GDP would be much  better and the outlook for the other European economies correspondingly worse. On the assumption that the euro holds, Germany drops from the fourth-largest economy in 2013 to the sixth largest in 2028 – after which it would drop below the UK. For France the drop is worse – from fifth in 2013 to 10th in 2023 and 13th in 2028. CEBR’s latest forecasts now show China overtaking the US in 2028 to become the world’s largest economy. This is later than some analysts have suggested and reflects the continuing performance of the US as the West’s strongest economy and the slowing down of the Chinese economy. India is expected to overtake Japan in 2028 to become the world’s third largest economy. Brazil overtook the UK in 2011 to briefly become the world’s sixth largest economy. But it has since fallen back and is not expected to overtake again until 2023.","We are seat to leapfrog Germany and France but lose to India and Brazil .

"By . Daniel Martin, Whitehall Correspondent . Tories expressed astonishment that Duncan Weldon, a former adviser to Harriet Harman, had secured the plum job on Newsnight . The BBC’s controversial new signing as Newsnight economics correspondent yesterday denied he was a ‘dangerous leftie’ – and revealed he once supported the leader of the British Union of Fascists Sir Oswald Mosley. Duncan Weldon, a former adviser to Harriet Harman, the Labour deputy leader, and economist at the TUC, was given the plum job earlier this week despite having little experience as a journalist. Senior Tories were furious, saying that the appointment was proof that the corporation is becoming increasingly biased against the Conservatives. Yesterday, Mr Weldon hit back in a . bizarre online article in which he said he spent more time as a banker . than a Labour adviser, and admits having had some sympathy when he was a . teenager for Mosley. After the year-long flirtation with the far right ended, he joined the Labour Party at the age of 18. He wrote on his blog that it had been a ‘weird few days’ since his appointment was announced. ‘Given my current role at the TUC and . brief stint as a Labour adviser, I fully expected my appointment to . raise a few eyebrows,’ he said. ‘Even so I wasn’t quite prepared for the howls of outrage from some quarters. ‘Never mind that I have . spent more of my career working in the apolitical worlds of the Bank of . England and fund management than working for Labour or the unions, or . that several right-wing economists and commentators familiar with my . work warmly welcomed my appointment, or that I have frequently been . critical of Labour’s economic policy. Writing under a pseudonym, Duncan Weldon, the new BBC Newsnight correspondent, confessed to his flirtation with fascism . Mr Weldon, a former adviser to . Harriet Harman, the Labour deputy leader, and economist at the TUC, was . given the plum Newsnight job earlier this week despite having little experience as . a journalist . ‘None of that seemed relevant to those who saw me as a dangerous leftie corrupting the BBC’s coverage of economics.’ He said he had come clean about his . involvement with the far right - during what he called the . ‘hormone-charged mists of adolescence’ - following an approach from a . Sunday newspaper. He said he had had a ‘brief and . misguided flirtation’ with the ideas of the far right after reading a . biography of Mosley by Robert Sidelsky, whom he said had ‘seemed to grasp the need to . tackle unemployment where other politicians did not’. He said he never attended any far right meetings and had joined Labour by the time he was 18. A year later, he wrote a piece about his involvement with the far right for a student paper in Oxford, which appeared under the headline: ‘I was a fascist’. The first paragraph of the piece said: ‘Like a lot of bad things this started with the Tory party.’ He said in his blog that the wording made him ‘wince’, adding: ‘I suspect I may be reminded of that line a few times in the coming months.’ Mr Weldon concluded: ‘Reflecting on the last week, it’s hard to escape the irony that I have been accused of being a dangerous leftie and also a fascist within 48 hours. I hope I’m neither. ‘I think I’ve got a long track record – from the Bank of England to the TUC – of examining the economic facts and letting the chips fall where they may. ‘The BBC is full of journalists from a wide range of backgrounds who left their political baggage at the door the day they started work. I’m confident that once in the job I’ll be able to do just that.’ Sir Oswald Mosley was the charismatic founder of the British Union of Fascists . Before he founded the British Union . of Fascists, Sir Oswald Ernald Mosley was the MP for Harrow from 1918 to . 1924 being elected for the Conservatives before becoming independent . and then joining the Labour Party. He served as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in Ramsay Macdonald’s Labour administration. He . resigned from the government in protest at their unemployment policies, . which he had tried to reform but found himself blocked by the party . hierarchy. He formed the . New Party which amalgamated with the BUF in 1932. Mosley allied himself with Nazi Germany. In October 1936, Mosley and . his supporters decided to march through Cable Street in the East End, . the home of a thriving Jewish community, to celebrate the fourth . anniversary of the founding of the party. By . 1pm on the day, around 2,000 of Mosley’s black shirts had gathered around Cable . Street while around 500 Jews and anti-fascists congregated at Gardiner’s . Corner. They ran to Cable Street where they armed themselves with sticks and formed a . barricade by overturning a lorry. At 3.30pm, Cable Street was the scene . of some of the worse street fighting seen in England and Mosley’s . Bentley drove into Dock Street where it was pelted with bricks. Mosley’s supporters began chanting his name while the anti-fascists . retaliated with the Internationale. Mosley then gave a Hitler salute and . was advised by the police to drive back through the City of London . rather than press ahead. Mosley gave a brief speech in which he accused . the government of surrendering to “red violence and Jewish corruption”. At 4pm, the remaining fascists dispersed allowing the local to claim . victory. Mosley was interned in 1940 and the BUF proscribed. He was . released in 1943, and, politically disillusioned in Britain, he moved . abroad in 1951, spending most of the remainder of his life in France. He died in 1980.","Duncan Weldon was adviser to Harriet Harman and worked for TUC .

"By . Daniel Martin, Whitehall Correspondent . Exhausting: Anna Soubry's work may have triggered a bout of pneumonia . Outspoken minister Anna Soubry has admitted her present defence job is much more ‘civilised’ than the health one she left last year. Miss Soubry was public health minister from 2012 to 2013 during a turbulent time when she had to deal with calls for the plain packaging of cigarettes and minimum alcohol pricing. But at the last reshuffle, she was moved to the Ministry of Defence to become minister for defence personnel, welfare and veterans – a job she says is less ‘demanding’. In an interview with House magazine, the former This Morning presenter said she works so hard as an MP that  it may have caused a recent bout of pneumonia. She said: ‘I plough my furrow, I work hard in my constituency. I work seven days a week: it’s exhausting, which is why I’ve had pneumonia. 'But this job is nothing like as demanding as my old job – this is completely civilised. ‘I get to see more of everything, more of my constituents, more of the girls for sure, more of my Neil as well, so it’s tons better.’ Miss Soubry said that the fact she was MP for the marginal seat of Broxtowe in Nottinghamshire meant that it was a ‘seven day a week job’. ‘I haven’t looked at my emails today but when I leave here and go back to my flat I will then look at my emails,’ she said. ‘And you would think they would be about Europe or the state of the economy. No they will be about the state of someone’s pothole. And lots of issues like greenbelt.’ She added she felt ‘vindicated’ that the government had decided to revive plans for plain packaging of cigarettes after earlier going cold on the idea. And she said it was ‘rubbish’ that the Tories’ election strategist Lynton Crosby - who has been linked to lobbying for the tobacco industry - had blocked the scheme. Former role: Anna Soubry as a TV presenter on the Channel 4 show Speak Out with Murray Bolland . ‘I think the problem was we had the consultation before we had the debate,’ she said. ‘Because we had the consultation first, we allowed the tobacco companies to take the debate and twist it and turn it around.’ She described the recent vote in favour of banning smoking in cars in front of children as ‘briliant’.","Outspoken MP was moved to Ministry of Defence after turbulent time .

"By . Daniel Martin, Whitehall Correspondent . The Environment Agency has rubber-stamped the building of almost 200,000 homes on flood plains since it was formed, figures reveal. The under-fire quango agreed to their construction despite concerns they may become uninsurable or that owners could face sky-high premiums. Official statistics show that since the agency was created in 1996, up to 14,500 homes have been built every year on low-lying areas near rivers. Most of the 190,000 homes built on low-lying land since 1996 were constructed without objection from the Environment Agency, despite the risk to homeowners . Councils are obliged by law to seek the approval of the Environment Agency if they are considering developments on flood plains. If the agency objects, the scheme usually does not go ahead. It has been a stressful time for anyone affected by the floods. But it seems the task of dealing with the political fallout may also be taking its toll on David Cameron’s hair. The Prime Minister was looking distinctly greyer as he unveiled £10million in aid for flood-hit businesses during a visit to Worcestershire and Gloucestershire yesterday. He also vowed to build more flood defences and said a rethink was needed over dredging. The official figures, which emerged in response to a parliamentary question from Labour MP Chris Ruane, show that an estimated 190,000 homes were built on flood plains since 1996. Most will have been built without the Environment Agency raising an objection. In many cases, however, it will have just advised the council on how to ensure the properties are as flood resistant as possible. The figures also reveal that, despite Labour’s criticisms of the Government’s handling of the floods crisis, more homes were built in high risk areas under the party than since. Between 1997 and 2010, there were 171,700 new homes constructed on flood-risk areas, with a peak of 14,500 in 2006. The annual totals have decreased since the last election, down to just 7,900 in 2011. Planning minister Nick Boles said the number was now ‘at its lowest rate since records began’. He added: ‘The figure will never be zero, as this would mean there would be a complete ban on any form of development in many existing towns and cities which happen to be flood-risk areas.’ Instead, new buildings in high risk areas must be ‘appropriately flood resistant and resilient’, he said. The figures emerged as the agency yesterday warned that parts of southern England including Kent, Hampshire, Wiltshire and Dorset could remain under water for ‘weeks if not months’. Although respite from extreme weather is expected, experts said many homes are not yet ‘out of the woods’. As the relief effort continued in the Somerset Levels, it was revealed yesterday that offenders have been helping to fill sandbags. Probation Service officials supervised seven convicted criminals as they used 14 tonnes of sand to fill 600 bags on Saturday. A group of five filled 750 bags the day after. Meanwhile, David Cameron has pledged to go to every flood-hit area of the country to ‘try to learn lessons’ after a visit to Upton-upon-Severn in Worcestershire. Between 1997 and 2010, there were 171,700 new homes constructed on flood-risk areas, with a peak of 14,500 in 2006 . Insurance companies will also be called to Downing Street today to discuss the extra help they can give flood-affected households. Do you need to make an insurance claim? Here's our advice for making the process as painless as possible. Worried about getting insurance next year? Here's what you need to know. 'My home wasn't flooded - but our premiums have gone up?' Our experts answer your questions. The bosses of firms including Aviva, Direct Line and Lloyds will meet floods minister Dan Rogerson and Cabinet Office ministers Oliver Letwin and Jo Johnson. A spokesman for the Prime Minister said: ‘The insurance sector should be doing as much as they can to support people in terms of proactively going out and contacting individuals who may be affected, and offering the speediest assistance in terms of making claims.’ The Association of British Insurers last night said flood victims have so far received £14 million in emergency payments – typically between £500 and £3,000 each. Some £2 million has been paid out for emergency accommodation. An ITV poll showed that almost two thirds of Britons think the Government is emerging from the floods crisis with a worse reputation for climate management.","Up to 14,500 homes a year were rubber-stamped by agency .

"By . Daniel Martin, Whitehall Correspondent . Prolific: One in eight Britons now take statins, which cost 10p per day, but they may be over-used . Britain is the statins capital of Europe with more than one in eight of us taking cholesterol-busting pills. Doctors say rising obesity is behind the increase in prescriptions for the drug, which protects against heart attack and stroke. Almost eight million now take statins, which cost just 10p per patient per day. But there are concerns that GPs are dishing them out as the easiest solution rather than persuading patients to adopt a healthier lifestyle, which can also lower the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Eight million Britons now take statins compared to five million a decade ago. Our ranking as the top prescriber of anti-cholesterol drugs in Europe – and second across the developed world – is a wake-up call a day after millions of Britons recover from over-indulgence on Christmas Day. Only Australia hands out higher levels of such drugs, according to the comparison of 23 industrialised countries by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. In Britain, family doctors can earn bonuses for tackling cholesterol problems, raising questions about their real incentive to prescribe the drug. One in five who take statins suffer side effects including muscle pain, memory disturbance, cataracts and diabetes. The OECD study confirmed that Britain is the fattest nation in Europe, with 24.8 per cent of adults classed as obese. Tam Fry, from the National Obesity Forum, said he feared GPs were prescribing statins too readily because it was easier than changing a patient’s habits. ‘Lifestyle advice has always got to be the preferred route, and of course it is of no expense to the NHS,’ he said. ‘There can also be side effects with statins. Top of the poppers: The UK is second only to Australia for the proportion of its citizens taking statin drugs . ‘But unfortunately now, because doctors are under so much pressure and because statins are known to be so successful, the simplest thing is to reach for the pad and write out a prescription.’ Valerie Paris, an economist from the OECD’s health division, pointed to the fact that those at risk of heart attack and strokes are often flagged up earlier in the UK. ‘The UK has quite high levels of obesity and is above average on alcohol consumption,’ she said. ‘But unlike in France, where doctors simply don’t ask about this type of thing, people with risk factors are detected earlier. ‘The question is though whether these people are given advice about improving their lifestyle, or are they put quickly on to statins?’ Doctors used to prescribe statins only to those with a 30 per cent risk of a heart attack in the next ten years, but this was lowered to those with a 20 per cent risk in 2005. Medical regulators are considering whether to go further and follow American guidance which suggests the drugs should be given if the risk is just 7.5 per cent. The drugs, pictured left, divide opinion. One in five people suffer side effects including muscle pain, cataracts and diabetes but some doctors say statins should be prescribed automatically to all people over the age of 50 . Some cardiologists have suggested statins should be automatically prescribed to all from the age of 50. But others are disturbed at the practice of dispensing the pills ever more widely. The OECD study says the use of cholesterol-lowering drugs, including statins, has more than tripled across member countries between 2000 and 2011. The US was not included in the research. Highest levels of prescribing were in Australia, followed by the UK and Slovakia, which both prescribe the drugs to 13 per cent of the population. The report, Health at a Glance 2013,  showed the UK was among those with the highest consumption per capita in 2011, over 40 per cent more than the OECD average. Dr Madina Kara, neuroscientist at the Stroke Association, said the drugs were very effective at protecting against heart attack and stroke and estimated to save 7,000 lives in the UK every year. But she said many Britons needed to make simple day-to-day changes, such as taking regular exercise, adopting a balanced diet and stopping smoking.","Eight million of us now take the drugs compared to five million in 2003 .

"By . Daniel Martin, Whitehall Correspondent . There is still a ‘shameful’ lack of working class people on public bodies as the establishment maintains its stranglehold on British life. Parliament is now more dominated by the middle classes than it was in 1979, with just 4 per cent of MPs from manual trades - down from 16 per cent. Those from working class backgrounds are also under-represented among local magistrates, according to the damning report from centre-right think tank Policy Exchange. Experts say that Parliament is more dominated by the middle classes than in 1979, with just 4 per cent of MPs from a manual trades background . The study found that Labour’s equalities policies have failed to promote people from working class communities to public office. The Equality Act 2010 stipulated that discriminating on the grounds of gender, race and disability is wrong, but no reference was made to socio-economic background. Constitutional expert Dr Michael Pinto-Duschinsky, lead author of the report, said: ‘It is vital for a functioning democracy that all its citizens are represented in public life, no matter their background, colour or gender. ‘Quite frankly it’s shameful that working class communities are being excluded from sitting on public bodies. Setting up an immediate inquiry into this problem will help determine the size of this problem and draw attention to a much needed area of debate. The establishment has a stranglehold on British life according to experts who have analysed the work backgrounds of those working in parliament compared to 36 years ago . ‘Diversity policies that reflect the true make up of this country will ensure that our brightest and best - regardless of their backgrounds - are given the opportunity to make a real difference to their communities. ‘Action to encourage individuals in manual occupations should not be in the form of quotas or statistical “targets”. Rather, there should be special schemes to help those in manual occupations to apply for roles and to persuade employers to grant time off to carry out public duties.’ The paper warned that current diversity policies are far too narrow, focusing on gender, disability and ethnicity to the exclusion of class. The experts also found that working class people were underrepresented on magistrates benches . It found that while the number of female and minority ethnic MPs has risen since the end of the 1970s, the percentage of manual workers in parliament has substantially diminished - from 98 (16 per cent) in 1979 to 25 (4 per cent) in 2010. The working classes are also underrepresented on magistrates benches. The number of women acting as local magistrates, for example, still needs to increase by more than 40 per cent of above their present number before they reach parity with their percentage in the general population. For ethnic minorities there would need to be an increase of some 150 per cent to achieve parity. But for those in routine and manual occupations, the increase needs to be no less than 873 per cent. In other words, they are nearly 10 times under-represented. The report also found that the panels that select public appointments are almost entirely - 96 per cent - made up of middle class professionals. Not a single person came were from a manual or routine occupation. It said that while it is expected that those selecting the next British judge to Strasbourg would have a professional understanding of law, there is no such requirement for lay magistrates, school governors or volunteers visiting prisons as independent monitors. Dr Pinto-Duschinsky concluded that the UK needs an extension to its entire equalities policy, and calls for an inquiry to be run by the Government Equalities Office and the Equality and Human Rights Commission. The inquiry should report on the facts about the percentage of public appointees from routine and manual occupations, recommend special initiatives to encourage such appointments and set out how socio-economic equality will be made an integral part of their future work. The new policy should not involve quotas, ‘targets’ or legislative stipulations, but instead special initiatives to encourage under-represented groups to apply for public office. The paper also calls for greater transparency about the membership of interviewing panels for public appointments, and to avoid the overabundance of civil servants on these panels, to ensure that there are no underlying prejudices or inherent bias in the selection process.","Parliament is more dominated by the middle classes than in 1979 .

"By . Daniel Martin, Whitehall Correspondent . Millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money will be spent on a new political class of government officials under plans by Cabinet ministers. The Coalition says the employment of dozens of politically appointed civil servants – chosen by ministers and not other civil servants – is vital to ‘put a rocket’ under Whitehall and make sure they implement manifesto reforms. But critics say the plans will see the upper echelons of the civil service being stuffed with cronies and ‘mates’ on salaries of up to £84,000 each. Reality: The move to give ministers bigger personal teams of advisers is designed to counter the control of the civil service, described in sitcom Yes Minister as the 'opposition in residence' Nick Clegg was forced to defend the plans in the Commons yesterday after being accused by a Tory backbencher of bringing in an unpopular style of administration from the United States. Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude argues elected politicians need more support to deliver on their promises . In Britain, civil servants are traditionally appointed by other civil servants, seen as a more independent system than the politicised American system. Ministers can currently hire a small number of political appointees known as special advisers or ‘spads’. Over the last year, the amount spent on these has jumped by 16 per cent, despite David Cameron’s pre-election pledge to ‘bring down the cost of politics’. The £7.2million total cost is now more than it was under Labour. But the Coalition announced in July that it wanted to allow ministers to extend their private offices with the employment of more staff taken on by them and not other civil servants. This will mean millions more will be spent on politically-appointed staff. And, unlike spads, these officials will be able to instruct other civil servants. There will be no limit on the number of people in an extended office, but insiders played down the idea of ministers hiring ten or more aides. They will have to find the money from within existing budgets. Ministers have become increasingly frustrated with obstruction from Whitehall mandarins, which they say has led to an unacceptably slow pace of reform. They say the problem is civil servants report to the most senior official in their department – the permanent secretary – and therefore have loyalty to him and not the minister. The Tories hope the ‘extended ministerial offices’ will force Whitehall to raise its game. The appointees will be on civil service contracts, and will be able to command salaries of up to £84,000 without approval from Civil Service Commissioners. But the idea was attacked in the Commons yesterday by MPs on both sides. In a reference to an American TV series, Tory MP Philip Hollobone said the plans would turn the Government in to a West Wing-style administration. He said it will be ‘completely unpopular as far as the country  is concerned’. Backing: David Cameron promises to cut the number of special advisers, but since being in government has admitted ministers need bigger teams, not smaller . Labour’s Luciana Berger said the plans would allow ministers to employ their friends. But Mr Clegg defended the policy, saying: ‘This is not a plan to import an endless series of political advisers. ‘This is actually recognising something that has been recommended to Government by a number of independent think-tanks and others – to allow ministers independent access to external policy expertise which is just sometimes lacking in Whitehall in offices that ministers find themselves in.’ Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, Culture Secretary Maria Miller and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt are expected to be the first to expand their coterie of advisers. Cabinet office minister Francis Maude, who drew up the plans, is also expected to hire a larger team. Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA which represents senior civil servants, said: ‘The danger is ministerial offices, staffed by personal appointees will ultimately be loyal to their minister, not the taxpayer.’","Ministers to have power to create extended private offices to wield power .

"By . Daniel Martin, Whitehall Correspondent . Opponents of the controversial HS2 line are ‘putting the future of the North of England at risk’, David Cameron told business leaders yesterday. Speaking at the CBI annual conference, the Prime Minister insisted HS2 was a ‘vital investment’ which will guarantee that in future, economic growth will not be confined to the South of England. He also dismissed suggestions that there are other ways of tackling the cost of modernising the railways. Warning: David Cameron told the CBI conference that HS2 opponents are putting the North of England at risk . In a clear swipe at Labour, Mr Cameron said: ‘To people who say there is some other cost-reduction plan we could also have, I say that is nonsense. ‘People who are against it, in my view, are putting our country’s future at risk, they are putting the future of the North of England at risk. ‘We need to have a concerted consensus across business, across politics, that we are going to get behind these large infrastructure projects.’ The Prime Minister said he was ‘passionate’ about the HS2 scheme, which will initially link London with Birmingham before being extended into a Y-shaped route that will reach Manchester and Leeds. He added: ‘We need to build new railway lines in our country. We haven’t built a line that is north of London for 120 years. I think it is absolutely right to make this investment. Controversial: The HS2 rail line will initially link London with Birmingham, before being extended into a Y-shaped route that will reach Manchester and Leeds . ‘It is going to unite our country, it . will help drive economic growth, it will make sure our economy shares . growth between the North and South, it will link eight of our ten . biggest cities.’ Mr Cameron also rejected arguments that the cost of HS2 will divert investment away from other work on the UK’s transport network. He pointed out that planned spending on the project between 2015 and 2020 totals £16billion – less than a quarter of the £73billion earmarked for improvements to roads and railways. Attempting to shore up support for the faltering scheme, the Prime Minister went on to announce that Sir David Higgins, the new boss of the planned rail link, had been tasked with finding ways to cut the estimated £50billion price of the scheme, drive down costs and ‘make it affordable for our country’. Speech: Mr Cameron also dismissed suggestions that there are other ways of tackling the cost of modernising the railways . The former chief executive of the London Olympic Delivery Authority, Sir David - who takes over as HS2 chairman next year - believes the scheme can come in ‘substantially’ under current estimates if cuts are made to the £14billion contingency costs. Mr Cameron told the CBI: ‘I want to make sure we get every penny of value for money from this HS2 investment. I think it is fantastic that Sir David Higgins - the man who built the Olympics on time and on budget - is going to be running HS2. ‘I think with Sir David Higgins in charge, with the budget we have and the contingency we have, this is a good investment for Britain.’ He added: ‘One of the first things he is going to do is make absolutely sure we drive every extra bit of cost out of this that we can, so it comes in under the budget that’s been set. ‘There is already a contingency of £14billion there. I know he will do a good job and make it affordable for our country.’ The scheme will need cross-party approval if it is to succeed, but at the same conference, shadow chancellor Ed Balls announced that Labour was still concerned about spiralling costs. He told business leaders that he was not going to be signing a ‘blank cheque’ for the plans. In his speech, Mr Balls went on to say: ‘Labour supports HS2 because of the capacity constraints on the existing rail network. ‘But our support for it is not at any cost. The Labour Party cannot - and will not - give the Government a blank cheque. Building a consensus about long-term infrastructure does not mean turning a blind eye to value for money.’","David Cameron says HS2 opponents are putting North of England at risk .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . and James Nye . The decorated Green Beret known as Lawrence of Afghanistan has claimed he was forced out of the military because of his push for U.S. troops to 'go native'. For years Special Forces Major Jim Gant had been praised for battle skills, but in 2012 he was forced to take retirement over claims that he was drinking and giving fuel to tribal police. He was also reprimanded for allowing his girlfriend - war correspondent and former Washington Post reporter Ann Scott Tyson - to live with him in a dangerous region of the war-torn country. Scroll down for video . Lawrence of Afghanistan: Major Jim Gant (center standing) with his troops and members of the local Pashtun tribe in Mangwel in Afghanistan . Side by side: Major Gant with a Pashtun fighter - he had convinced his superiors that working to win the trust of the tribesmen was key to winning the war in Afghanistan . In an interview with ABC News, which will be shown on Nightline Friday, Gant has spoken of how he felt closer to the Afghan villagers he was living with, that Americans. The 44-year-old formed such a close bond with the Pashtun villagers he and his men were living alongside that he was made a tribal leader by the Mohmand tribe. With his . long hair, unkempt bear and flowing robes, Gant looked more like Osama . bin Laden than a US military officer - but his command was successful . and his fame as Lawrence of Afghanistan meant he was welcoming VIPS to . his Mangwel base. Senator . John McCain and presidential candidate Mitt Romney were just some of . the politicians who wanted to see first hand the unconventional success . Gant, who was awarded the Silver Star medal for service in Iraq, enjoyed. Despite the high-profile visits, none noticed that he had Scott Tyson living with him, in direct violation of military rules. Secret love affair: Ann Scott Tyson and Jim Gant became part of the Pashtun tribe he was supporting and their relationship blossomed in Mangel, in northern Afghanistan . Revelations: Ann Scott Tyson and former Major Jim Gant discussed their secret love affair and life in Afghanistan for ABC News . Gant won over his superiors in 2009, at a time when the U.S. feared it was losing the war in Afghanistan in 2009. He wrote a 45-page pamphlet, One Tribe At A Time, which detailed how the U.S. could win. He believed the only way to do this was to earn the loyalty of the . country's Pashtun tribes - and he thought the way to do this was to go . native. The . pamphlet so impressed Petraeus, who had been made commander in . Afghanistan in 2010, that he encourage Gant to follow through with his . theories. 'It . wasn't about our weapons or our body armor... it was gonna be about how . we treated them. And it worked. It worked in a big way,' said Gant. He pushed for troops to drop their heavy armor and military fatigues for tribal dress, saying that as well as instill trust in locals, it also was more comfortable for his men. 'You could move further, you could move . faster, you could run farther. You could take cover . more quickly. You could carry more ammunition, you could carry more . water. It was just an absolute no brainer,' he said. After winning over the locals he was able to convince them to fight the Taliban. He told them: 'Tell everyone you come into contact . with, I did not come here to fight. I came here to help the people,” Gant told dozens of tribal police in one 2012 video Tyson shot. 'But if . someone wants to f***in’ fight, they know where I am.' Backing: General David Petraeus is seen here with Major Jim Gant in Mangwel on a visit in 2011. The former general endorsed Gant's unconventional methods . Fighting force: Major Gant with members of his Pashtun tribesmen who joined him in fighting the Taliban before he was airlifted out in March 2012 . General David Petraeus . visited Gant in 2011 and saw the level to which he had become accepted . by the tribesmen, even becoming like a son to their chief, Malik Noor . Afzhal, nicknamed Sitting Bull. Document: Scott Tyson has written American Spartan which recounts her time in Afghanistan with Gant . 'Gant . did go native. You go native so that the natives feel that you respect . them and are comfortable with them and trust them, above all. And he . really was adopted as a son by Sitting Bull... there was no question . about the relationship between these two individuals. And that's what . you want,' Petraeus said to ABC News. 'Jim had become more Pashtun than the Pashtuns,' Tyson wrote in her book. But . some thought Gant was going too native and whispered that he was . becoming a Colonel Kurtz figure along the lines of Marlon Brando's . character in the Vietnam film, Apocalypse Now. Gant's theory of how to win the trust of Afghans was tested to its limit amid widespread anger after U.S. troops accidentally burned copies of the Koran in a separate province. In violation of a country-wide order from his superiors to keep his post on lock down, Gant told his men they were to continue walking through the village. In footage filmed by Scott Tyson as he briefed the men, Gant is heard saying: 'You're going to have to trust me. I'm putting your lives in my f****** hand and saying I'm going to protect you.' He said despite orders to stay at their post, he intended to walk around the village to show that he trusted them. Clandestine: Tyson and Gant knew that if their affair was confirmed to his superiors then his career could be over . Special force: Major Jim Gant suffers from PTSD now following his service in Iraq and Afghanistan and struggles with the manner in which he was dismissed from the military . Friends: Major Gant became so accepted by his Pashtun tribesmen that the chief Malik Noor Afzhal, nicknamed Sitting Bull, thought of him as his son . Scott Tyson said: 'You must trust the people you're with, and therein lies your security. He lived by that.' Gant also admitted to ABC that it was sometimes safer to break the rules that to follow them while in Afghanistan. Since being removed from the country in 2012, forced to shave, and then stripped of his military honors, Gant has been living in Seattle, Washington. He returned with Scott Tyson to the Afghan village they had lived in for so long two years ago, and was greeted like family. Footage shows villagers embracing Gant and firing their weapons into the surrounding hills in celebration. Gant described it as 'happy gunfire' and said: 'Music to my ears, yes... and it was saying, ""I love you and I miss you"".' it was a more welcome response than his final dealings with the military, who had condemned him for being a 'disgrace' - a charge he says causes him the most pain after all the success he enjoyed. Gant's . commanders claim to this day that they had no idea that the Green Beret . was keeping a woman the Taliban openly referred to in radio . communications as 'his wife' by his side - against all rules and . regulations. Trust: Looking more like Osama bin Laden - Major Gant (center) was named Commander Jim by his Pashtun troops . Dismissed: When the military found out about Gant's history of drinking and his affair with Tyson they airlifted him out of Mangwel . Despite . their love affair, Gant had endured constant fighting in Mangwel for 22 . consecutive months and had developed a problem with drinking and pain . killers. Drinking in Afghanistan is against army rules as is conducting ongoing relationships during warfare. In . confidential files revealed by Tyson and Gant, the major was relieved . because he 'indulged in a self-created fantasy world' supported by his . 'wife'. He was stripped of his Special Forces honors, demoted to captain and made to retire. We both . knew that there was a lot of risk in doing what we did. And I would do . it again,' Gant told ABC News this month in his first television . interview. 'It was extremely unconventional, yes, to say the least.' Emotional: Two years on Jim Gant struggles to talk about how he left Afghanistan . Daily life: Major Jim Gant suffers PTSD now and is trying to re-adjust to life in Seattle . In that interview, Gant admits he drank, took drugs and kept Tyson with him - all against regulations. However, . he claims that his superiors were aware he was not a by-the-book . soldier and luminaries such as retired Petraeus were . supporters. 'I . never left the battlefield defeated. I never lost a man. Well over 20 . awards for valor for the men that I fought alongside. We went after ‘em . every single day. I brought all my men home. That’s it,' Gant said. Indeed, Petraeus still calls Gant, Lawrence of Afghanistan - a comparison that Gant was keen to play up to. Despite . all that has happened, Gant and Tyson, who married last year, have come . forward to tell their story in Tyson's new book, American Spartan: The . Promise, The Mission And The Betrayal of Special Forces Major Jim Gant. In March, Roberts filed a statement accusing Gant of 'immoral and illegal activities and actions' and said he was often 'intoxicated and under the influence of pain medications.' Gant admits this, claiming he was suffering PTSD brought on by his constant services. 'I was drinking alcohol, I was taking sleeping medication. I was taking pain medication,' Gant explained in the ABC News interview. 'I admitted to that. And they came in. They came in and got me out of there.' He was airlifted out immediately and made to shave his beard and wear his uniform. 'I would have rather been in the hands of the Taliban at that point,' he said. 'It was crushing. It was absolutely crushing.' He was flown to Fort Bragg, North Carolina where his Green Beret status was stripped and he was demoted to Captain. His superior officer Lt. General John Mulholland delivered what Gant saw as the killer blow. His reprimand labeled Gant a 'disgrace' with no 'moral character', having 'indulged in a self-created fantasy world.'","Major Jim Grant was respected and praised by then General David Petraeus - US commander in Afghanistan .

"By . Lydia Warren . and Snejana Farberov . and James Nye . A 64-year-old 'nightmare nanny' who stopped working for the California family that hired her and refused to move out is finally ready to leave their home, it has emerged. Marcella Bracamonte said that Diane Stretton contacted the family's lawyer on Saturday night and said she could be out of their Upland home, near Los Angeles, by July 4. 'She would like to move out but because of the hot weather that's going to happen soon,' Mrs Bracamonte told People. But the mom-of-three doesn't think the battle is over just yet because the family is scheduled to go on vacation on July 2. Good riddance: Diane Stretton, 64, has told her former employers that she will leave their home before July 4 - weeks after she moved in and stopped carrying out work for them . 'I feel like it's a trap,' she said. 'I feel like she . knows that I'm going to be gone and that she wants to lock me out of my . home.' Mrs Bracamonte and her husband had hired in March through Craigslist to do chores and watch their young children in return for room and board in their home. Mrs Bracamonte said she had called previous employers to get references and saw no problems. But they became exasperated after she stopped working within weeks, said she had chronic pulmonary disease, ignored repeated requests to leave, and made them scared for their property and the safety of their children, aged one, four and 11. The family also said the woman, who had been homeless before she moved in with them, threatened to sue them for wrongful termination and elder abuse. Stumped: Marcella and Ralph Bracamonte with their three children, ages, 11, 4 and one . Police declined to intervene in a civil matter because the employment agreement included giving her a place to live, so the couple launched an eviction process, which they feared could take months. Police say that once a person establishes residency they must be 'formally evicted' under California law, a process that could lead to a court-ordered 'forcible eviction' carried out by county sheriff's deputies. The family previously spoke out about their exasperation in the case. 'The first few weeks she was awesome,' said Bracamonte to ABC News about her squatter. 'She would come places with us, help out the kids. She was really great. 'All of a sudden she stopped working, she would stay in her room all day and only come out when food was ready.' Serious . problems began on June 6 when they came to her with what they called a . 'last chance letter', which outlined the terms of their initial . agreement and threatening her with eviction if she continued to do . nothing. Stretton . refused to sign it and said that she would be leaving in 30 days anyway . as the stress of the job had become too much for her. Legal problems: The Bracamonte's have said that they can't believe the battle to have Stretton removed . Careful: Mrs Bracamonte, pictured with her children, said she carried out background checks on the woman . At . this point they asked her to leave and served her with legal papers, . but Stretton counter-sued and a judge ruled in her favor because the . Bracamonte's did not complete a three-day quit notice correctly. 'When . I asked her why she wouldn’t sign the letter she said ""It’s not legal,"" and slammed the door in my face,' Bracamonte told ABC News. 'Once she . said the word legal, I knew it wasn’t going to be fun.' Police told the Bracamonte's there was nothing they could do. 'They told me it was now a civil matter,' Bracamonte said, 'and I have to legally evict her,' said Marcella Bracamonte to CBS2. 'So . this lady is welcome inside my house, anytime she wants, to eat my food . anytime she wants and harass me basically. I’m now a victim in my home . and it’s completely legal.' With the laws against them, the . family had few options. Due to the agreement, they were legally . obligated to provide her somewhere to stay and could not disrupt her. On one occasion, the 64-year-old called police for turning up the television too loud. Hiding out: Last week, the former nanny was seen camped out in her car outside a police station . On the move: Stretton used to live out of her silver Pontiac Grand Am (pictured) for days at a time . And as the Bracamonte's discovered, this was not the first time that Stretton - who was homeless before she was hired - has clashed in the courts with families. She has been involved in 36 lawsuits, ensuring she has made California's Vexatious Litigant list, for abusing the system. 'Anyone who looks at her crooked, she sues,' said Bracamonte. Documents reveal that she tried to block her two sisters from selling family property after her father 'specifically and expressly omitted Stretton' from his will and even sued her own son, Michael, for property damage and personal injury. But it also emerged that the woman was homeless before she was hired by the family. Kimberly Whitcomb, a friend of the rogue nanny, told MailOnline: 'She’s been homeless for about nine years.  She was staying in the homeless shelter (Path of Life) in Riverside. 'She was struggling and looking for another place and I said check Craigslist, they always have all kinds of odd stuff on there. She found the nanny job and I encouraged her to go for it.' Stretton has even filed paperwork to try and force the Bracamontes OUT of their own home, pictured here . Kimberly, who lived in the same apartment block as Stretton's son, Michael, and began collecting her mail for her when he moved to Arizona, even provided a reference for her friend. 'She got an interview with the lady and went out there and saw her. She used me as a personal reference and she had another friend from the shelter as a personal reference,' said Whitcomb. 'I spoke to the woman Marcella, I recommended Diane as a good person, as a nanny and as someone you can trust. 'She's very professional, she's got a master’s degree in something, I think it's biochemistry. But she has health issues, osteoporosis and arthritis.' Stretton recently lost her spot at the homeless shelter and was living in her car with a suitcase of her possessions, Whitcomb explained. It is not clear where she will go now that she is leaving the family's home.","Diane Stretton, 64, refused to leave the home of Marcella and Ralph Bracamonte in Upland, California after she stopped working for them .

"By . Meghan Keneally . and James Nye . President Obama has spoken out against the startling frequency of shootings in America, saying that the country should be 'ashamed'. 'We're the only developed country on Earth where this happens. And it happens now once a week. And it's a one-day story. There's no place else like this,' he said on Tuesday during a forum hosted by Tumblr. The shooting at Reynolds High School in Oregon on Tuesday that left one student dead before the shooter killed himself marked the 74th shooting since the 2012 tragedy at Sandy Hook elementary school. Disheartening: President Obama said Tuesday (pictured with Tumblr founder David Karp) that the U.S. has to do some soul searching over the prevalence of school shootings . Question time: The topic of gun control came up during a Tumblr forum at the White House on Tuesday and was asked by someone directly effected by the shooting at UC-Santa Barbara two weeks ago . The question was raised by a student from UC-Santa Barbara, where there was another shooting two weeks ago. 'The United States does not have a monopoly on crazy people. It's not the only country that has psychosis.' -President Obama, talking about how the prevalence of mental health issues is not the only reason why school shootings have become so common across the US . In spite of the wave of support that came after the Sandy Hook shooting, the Obama administration was unable to usher a gun control bill through the proper channels, meaning that no tangible change has gone into effect. 'I've been in Washington for a while now, and most things don't surprise me. The fact that 20 six year olds were gunned down in the most violent fashion possible and this town couldn't do anything about it is stunning to me,' he said. 'My biggest frustration so far is the fact that this society has not been willing to take some basic steps to keep guns out of the hands of people who can do just unbelievable damage.

Association. It's an issue the country needs to do some 'soul searching' on, he said. 'This is becoming the norm and we take it for granted in ways that, as a parent, are frightening to me,' he said. 'Right now, it's not even possible to get even the mildest restrictions through Congress, and we should be ashamed of that. He . pointed the finger at both members of Congress who are unwilling to . stand up to the NRA as well as citizens who are not motivated enough to . force their representatives to change.

'Rispler deserve a medal,' one student wrote . Obama . said that the lawmakers have to 'feel the heat' from their constituents . because 'until that happens, sadly, not much is going to change'. Data compiled by Everytown for Gun Safety that is an average of 1.37 school shootings for every school week since the Sandy Hook tragedy. This troubling statistic is based on the fact that an average school year typically lasts 180 days, meaning that in the 18 months since Sandy Hook there have been . approximately 270 days, or 54 weeks of school in attendance since that . day. The Everytown for Gun . Safety data shows that the shootings have occurred across the country, . from east to west as 31 states have suffered gun violence at schools.

"By . James Nye . A man has filed a lawsuit in California claiming that he is the biological father of tragic teen suicide victim Audrie Pott and therefore should be part of any financial wrongful death lawsuit. Michael Lazarin, 46, claimed on Wednesday in Santa Clara County Superior Court in San Jose that Sheila and Lawrence Pott, the teenager's legal parents, falsely claimed to be Audrie's sole heir's in the suit they lodged one year ago . Lazarin claims he was involved in a relationship with Sheila from 1995 to 2003 while she separated from her then-husband and had that Lawrence is not Audrie's biological father. Paternity claim: Michael Lazarin has filed a lawsuit in which he alleges he is the real father of tragic teenager Audrie Pott, who ended her own life in September, 2012, after cyberbullying . Audrie Pott ended her life when she was 15-years-old after she hanged herself at her mother's home on September 10, 2012, dying two days later. Desperate: Audrie Pott hanged herself aged 15 after three classmates allegedly sexually assaulted her and circulated photos of the sickening attack . The teenager had become distraught after a Labor Day weekend party at a friends house after partygoers allegedly sexually assaulted her and spread pictures of the attack. At the party the had drunk vodka mixed with gatorade and passed out in the bedroom of a friend and woke up without her shorts on. While she was unconscious, three teenage boys who were classmates at Saratoga High School, removed her clothes, used a pen to draw offensive messages on her body, took photographs on their cellphones and then abused her by 'digital penetration.' The boys pleaded guilty to sexual assault and two were sentenced to 30 days in juvenile hall in January, while the third was sentenced to 45 consecutive days. Lawrence and Sheila Pott filed their suit on April 15, 2013, against the parents of the unidentified boys involved for financial compensation. According to NBC Bay Area, they want damages for defamation, invasion of privacy, false imprisonment, battery, sexual battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress and conspiracy. They are also suing another unnamed teenage girl who allegedly helped Audrie to the bedroom and watched the boys. Heartbroken: Lawrence Pott and Audrie's stepmother and his second wife Lisa have allegedly sent Facebook messages accepting that Lazarin is Audrie's biological fatehr . Grieving: Audrie's mother, Sheila Pott, found her daughter hanging in the bathroom in September 2012 . In his lawsuit, Lazarin attached dozens of photographs of him, Audrie, Sheila and his family members taken in the late 1990s and early 2000s. He also attached an email from September 23 sent to his former lawyer, Gloria Allred from the Pott's attorney, Robert Allard. In it, Allard describes him as 'nothing more than a sperm donor.' He also provided Facebook messages written to him by Lawrence Pott's second wife, Lisa, in 2011, that he claims acknowledge he is Audrie's father. He said that if he is successful he expects to be included in the Pott's lawsuit. Cruel: Pott, right, was aassaulted after a night of drinking  and boys spread photos of the attack . He said to NBC Bay Area, his intention in filing suit is not for money but 'to bring closure to me and my family. 'The devastating effects have been far reaching and difficult to cope with as I have watched my daughter become a public spectacle because of the criminal actions that took place before her passing, the horrendous defilement of her by the boys who did not receive due punishment for what they had done,' he said. Lazarin said that when he met Sheila, she was 'going through an extensive divorce' from Lawrence. He said that Sheila gave birth to Audrie in 1997 and that he was involved in her upbringing up until Sheila and him separated in December 2003. After that he filed a paternity claim. Left behind: Audrie is pictured left with her father, step mother and half brother and sisters . Remembered: Photographs show Audrie and her family and an essay she wrote about her happy home life . However, he lost because then-Judge Dolores Carr said that he had missed a two-year statute of limitations to claim paternity, nor did he claim it while he was living with Sheila. 'I was in a full blown relationship with my daughter and Sheila,' he said. 'Why would I sue somebody? I knew it was my daughter.' In a court filing in 2006, Sheila Pott's lawyer Mary Simpson wrote that the Potts were married in 1992 and Lawrence Pott filed for divorce in 2001 but it did not became final until 2004. Simpson said that Sheila, while still legally married to Lawrence Pott, had an affair with Lazarin between April and September 1996, prior to Audrie's birth on May 27, 1997.","Michael Lazarin, 46, of Santa Clara, California, has filed a lawsuit against the parents of tragic teenager Audrie Pott .

"By . James Nye . Tempestuous relationship: Ashley and Rob Morrison seen here in 2008 in New York City are still together - despite Mr. Morrison's guilty plea for domestic assault, which he was cleared of today in a Connecticut court when the charges were dropped . Rob Morrison, the former New York City CBS anchorman forced to quit his $300,000 a year job after he was arrested for choking his wife walked away from court on Thursday with all charges dropped. Morrison, who is still married to former CBS MoneyWatch anchor Ashley Morrison was allowed to withdraw his previous guilty plea for the assault after completing a domestic violence program. Appearing in a Connecticut court after completing the 26-week program following the February 2013 incident, Morrison said that, 'I feel like it's a clean start.' Morrison was joined in court briefly by his wife of 11-years, who left him last year after he was accused of strangling her in a drunken argument in the early hours of the morning. Outside the courtroom Morrison said, 'I am obviously very happy this day has finally come. In the 14 months since this happened I have experienced an amazing amount of personal growth. For something that started out quite negatively, it transformed into something quite positive.' Morrison confirmed he was still with his wife, with whom he has an eight-year-old son and said that he is glad is family is 'intact' and that he felt positive for the future. He admitted that he acted badly the night police arrived at his Connecticut home and apologized for his actions.

Swimming before a sellout crowd and lots of cameras, Lochte led at the turn and Phelps was second. 'Down there at the turn I kind of peeked over and I saw him and almost started smiling,' Lochte said about his longtime friend and rival. Phelps interjected, 'Why? Because you were ahead?'

'I swam a final again,' a smiling Phelps said. 'I said I wanted to be around 52.0 and I would be completely happy with that.' He is the three-time Olympic champion and current world record-holder in the event. His time tied for fourth-quickest in the world. 'It's one meet; it's one race,' Phelps said. 'It's a long way whether I decide to continue or not. This was awesome. I'm really excited about how things went. I do know what I need to do if I want to continue and swim faster.'

He kept his ear buds in until he was introduced as an 18-time Olympic gold medalist. With his long hair sticking out from the back of his cap, he dived in next to Lochte, who beat him down to the first turn. 'I probably wouldn't have gone that time if Phelps wasn't in that pool with me. We push each other all the time,' said Lochte, who rivalry and friendship with Phelps dates to 2004. 'With what he's done for the sport of swimming and him leaving kind of broke my heart a little because I love getting on those blocks and racing him. Now that he's back I've got a big ol' smile on my face.' Lochte is trying to regain his own form after missing five months with a knee injury.

'My expectations were he would come and maybe enjoy it and not be terrible, so all those were met. That's a really good time to start with.' Phelps said 'that may have been the worst turn that I have ever done in my entire life.' Next up for Phelps is the 50 freestyle on Friday, when he will swim the prelims doing the butterfly stroke for training.

'Swimming needs you!' he tweeted after they traded handshakes. 'You rock!'

Racing for the first time since he retired in a blaze of glory after the 2012 London Olympics with a staggering career total of 18 gold medals, a relaxed Phelps cruised to victory in 52.84 seconds. His time was well outside the world record of 49.82 seconds he set at the 2009 world championships but still safely under the qualifying time for this year's U.S. national championships, which double as the selection event for next year's world titles in Russia. Phelps and his coach Bob Bowman were both reluctant to talk about their long term goals when they appeared at a packed news conference on the eve of his comeback but they did not rule out the possibility of competing at the 2016 Rio Olympics. Unshaven and still seven pounds (three kilograms) over his ideal racing weight, Phelps had planned to swim in three events at his comeback meet but ditched the 100m freestyle to focus on the 100m butterfly and Friday's 50m freestyle.","Michael Phelps lost in the first final of his much anticipated come-back after 20-months in retirement .

Distraught classmates queued down the street to pay their last respects at a funeral home in Milford, Connecticut. It is said Maren will be buried in her gown with the rose her boyfriend gave her for prom night. Sherry Johnson, a health care worker at Bridgeport Hospital, told the New Haven Register: 'It could have been anyone’s daughter... It could have been my daughter.' Her daughter Katie, 15, added: 'There’s still a lot of support going on for her. I can’t really picture how horrific it was for [her classmates].' Therapy dogs were used outside the wake and the nation's reporters and broadcasters were given their own area, at a respectful distance from the mourners. One family friend said Maren 'looked beautiful in there'. The stabbing has sparked a national debate about school safety. Sanchez, a member of the National Honor Society who was active in school drama, was killed in a hallway at Jonathan Law High School last Friday on the morning of her prom. She had organised the dance herself and was set to be prom queen, her friends said.

She died of wounds to her torso and neck, and her boyfriend is still reeling from her death, his father told MailOnline. Jarrod Butts, 16, was due to take Maren to prom but instead attended a memorial for his girlfriend, holding her prom dress. Speaking briefly on his doorstep on Sunday, . Mr Butts said his son had been 'hit hard' and was spending time with friends as they try to cope . with the devastating loss together. According to a police affadavit, a witness saw Plaskon on top of the 16-year-old victim during the attack, and tried unsuccessfully to pull him away. Another saw him discard a bloody knife. Plaskon was inside the principal's office with bloody clothes when an officer arrived and asked what happened, the affadavit continued. 'I did it. Just arrest me,' Plaskon replied. He was arraigned earlier this week at a psychiatric facility, where he is undergoing medical examination. Paying their respects: Friends of the teenager arrive at the funeral home yesterday . Gathering: Therapy dogs were used outside the wake and the nation's media were given their own area . Queue: Mourners paid their respects inside the funeral home and said the girl 'looked beautiful in there' The small seaside community has been devastated by Maren's death. Earlier this week Connecticut Governor Dannel P Malloy joined tributes to Maren which saw friends releasing purple balloons and tying purple ribbons together, in honor of her favorite color. Plaskon's family said they joined the community in mourning the loss of life as they struggled to understand what led to the crime. 'Words can only fall short in conveying the depth and breadth of the raw sadness we are left with by this unimaginable tragedy,' the family said. 'We join with the entire Milford community to celebrate the life and mourn the loss of this most vibrant and exceptional young woman.' His family thanked relatives, friends and neighbors for reaching out to them in what they called their darkest hour.

R.I.P. 4/25/14.' Plaskon is a ‘cutter’ who had previously attempted suicide and has a history of depression, his classmates have told MailOnline. Friends say the suspect, who previously dated Maren in middle school, battled ADHD and other mental issues that led to sometimes bizarre behavior in the classroom. 'He just wasn't right. I know his cousin. He didn't act right,' 16-year-old Seamus O’Reilly said. 'He had depression.’ Tyler Curtin, 16, said he was very close to Plaskon when they played on the football team together as freshmen – though Plaskon’s behavior had changed recently and the two grew apart. Plakson had previously tried to take his own life, Curtin said, adding: ‘He was dealing with a lot of things.’ He also began acting out and seeking attention from his classmates. For Halloween last year he wore a full bodysuit under his clothes and ripped his pants off in the middle of class, Curtin said.

"By . Helen Pow . An Occupy Wall Street protester who was convicted earlier this month of assaulting a police officer sobbed in court today because prison guards at Riker's Island brought her the wrong outfit to wear. Cecily McMillan was sentenced to three months' jail in mid May after her May 5 conviction. The 26-year-old appeared in court on a separate charge Wednesday and broke down in front of Manhattan Criminal Court judge Ann Scherzer over her clothing. 'She wasn't happy with the clothing she was given,' her defense lawyer Martin Stolar said, according to the New York Post. 'And she wanted to be uncuffed.' Tears: Cecily McMillan, pictured with her attorney Martin R Stolar in April, cried in court on Wednesday . The activist faces charges for claiming she was a lawyer and telling two men accused of fare-beating not to cooperate with a police officer in December. She was dressed in a white dress and beige blazer - almost identical outfit to one she sported when jurors handed down their guilty verdict on May 5. It's not clear if this is the reason she was unhappy with the outfit choice. Prosecutors offered McMillan a no​-​jail plea deal of community service and anger management if she confessed to the misdemeanor charge. Stolar said he and his client would consider it and added that the student was struggling in prison. 'It's not a very good place to be,' he said. 'She's not happy just like every other inmate.' McMillan became a cause celebre for . activists after she was charged with assaulting a police officer was . sentenced to 90 days in jail, with a judge saying a protest is no excuse . for an attack. Fans: Activists supported McMillian on May 19 when she was sentenced . McMillan apologized for injuring the officer but defiantly proclaimed her innocence as she was sentenced on one of the few felony convictions resulting from the New York protests. She could have been sent to prison for seven years. 'I have been exhausted of almost everything that makes me me, with one key exception: my dignity,' said the 25-year-old graduate student, jailed since the May 5 verdict in a case that she said showed 'the personal is inseparable from the political.' Prosecutors said McMillan baldly hit an officer in the face, misrepresented what happened and used her trial as 'a grandstand for her political opinions,' as Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Shanda Strain put it. McMillan was arrested as activists observed the Occupy's six-month mark on March 17, 2012. Police were clearing people from the movement's former home base at Zuccotti Park. Prosecutors pointed to video showing . McMillan elbowing an officer in the eye as he walked behind her, . ushering her along. She said she reacted out of alarm after her breast . was grabbed from behind, which the officer denied doing and isn't clear . in the video. She said police then roughed her up while arresting her as . she suffered what she believed was a seizure. Moment of arrest: This is the moment that Cecily McMillan was arrested on March 17, 2012 in Manhattan . McMillan's case became a rallying point for Occupiers, and members of the once-jailed Russian punk group Pussy Riot have visited her behind bars. Director Spike Jonze, Sonic Youth bassist Kim Gordon, some City Council members and even several of the jurors who convicted her wrote to the court asking for leniency. More than 171,000 people signed an online petition. For all that, 'a civil society must not allow an assault to be committed under the guise of civil disobedience,' Manhattan state Supreme Court Justice Ronald Zweibel said. 'Ms. McMillan must take responsibility for her conduct.' McMillan's supporters overflowed the courtroom at her sentencing, singing 'We Shall Not Be Moved,' a folk song recorded by Pete Seeger and long a protest staple, as they filed out afterward. More than 30 court officers lined the courtroom as well, an unusual show of crowd control that came after some spectators shouted 'Shame!' when she was convicted. McMillan's lawyer, Martin Stolar, said she plans to appeal the verdict and ask for bail while the appeal plays out.","Cecily McMillan was sentenced to three months' jail in mid May after her May 5 conviction for assaulting a police officer .

'I’d muse they’re definitely disappointed in what happened, and I just want to let them know I’m sorry for that. 'I want to show them I’m no longer that person, and I used my time in prison wisely.'

The pills were part of a drug problem that he said began when he was 'introduced to marijuana' on the set of A Bronx Tale. He later became hooked on crack and heroin, he said. He told the jury that while suffering from judgment-impairing heroin withdrawals on the night of the shooting, he accidentally broke the kitchen window of the apartment in a desperate attempt to wake up his old pill-supplier. 'I was becoming dope sick,' Brancato testified. 'Mentally, I was a mess.' Brancato tried to deflect suggestions by the prosecution that his testimony - at times punctuated by vignettes about his drug-crazed downfall - was another acting job. Warm welcome: Not everyone is as pleased as Lillo Brancato's family that he has been released from prison early, including Rosa Enchautegui, sister of the officer shot dead during the 2005 robbery . Brancato says his drug problem was so severe his own family nearly disowned him, and that he was still using at Rikers. ‘I had all these people supporting me, and they finally had had it,' he told the New York Post. 'They told me if I kept going like I was going, they wouldn’t be there. It really woke me up.' He says he has been clean since November 18, 2006. While behind bars, he got a degree in business management and administration.","Actor jailed for burglary that resulted in the death of NYPD officer .

"By . Dan Bloom . Since the dawn of air travel, we've felt guilty for gorging on fried food in dingy departure lounges in the middle of the night. But red-eyed passengers finally have an excuse to scoff themselves silly - because a carb-heavy fry-up could help conquer jet lag. Scientists have said foods which kick-start a big release of insulin, such as carbohydrates, could be crucial to resetting our body clock when we get out of sync with our natural cycle. Eat up... then go to bed! Researchers in Japan claim to have found a link between insulin - triggered when we eat many foods, including carbohydrates - and the resetting of our circadian rhythms which govern sleep . The researchers at Yamaguchi University, Japan, were trying to find ways of disrupting circadian rhythms, which govern how much our bodies want to sleep and when. It has long been known that darkness prompts the body to feel sleepy by sending signals to a central 'pacemaker' in the brain. In the same way, natural light makes us feel more awake. But the researchers also said each of our millions of cells has its own miniature sleep pattern which, when they are all taken together, contribute to the body overall. They found insulin could kick-start the tiny sleep patterns within each cell and encourage our bodies to change the time at which we want to fall asleep. The study, published in the journal Cell Reports, tested the theory on mice which were fed unusually large meals during the night. Airline food: Passengers on a red-eye flight could now have a good excuse for gorging on unhealthy meals . Scans of the rodents' liver cells found insulin, the hormone released by the pancreas when they ate food high in sugar and starch, had an effect on the cells' circadian rhythms. Dr Makoto Akashi, one of the lead researchers on the project, said: 'In short, insulin may . help the stomach clock synchronize with mealtime. 'For example, for jet lag, dinner should be enriched with ingredients promoting insulin secretion, which might lead to a phase advance of the circadian clock, whereas breakfast would be the opposite.' There would be side effects to using insulin to treat insomniacs, Dr Akashi warned. And any treatment would not be as effective on patients with type 2 diabetes, who have problems producing the hormone. The researcher added his theory needs more testing before it can be seen as conclusive. But he claimed the research could be crucial to the world's health - as defying our natural sleep patterns 'carries a significant . risk of diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, . sleep disorders, and cancer'.","Research was carried out by scientists from Yamaguchi University in Japan .

"By . Louise Boyle . and James Nye . and Lydia Warren . A tiny shack on the Manhattan Bridge where a 57-year-old homeless man has lived for a year has today been ripped down by New York police. A dozen officers wearing helmets and brandishing hammers raided the home on Thursday morning and broke up the man's coffin-sized shack, which he had built from flimsy wood. Officers tore up the wood and pulled down his belongings, including pots, bedsheets, clothing and even electrical items, before dumping them in an overflowing truck. The man, who previously told MailOnline his name . was Joey, was taken to the Bellevue Men's Shelter in Midtown Manhattan, an NYPD spokesman said today. Scroll down for video . Ripped down: Law enforcement officers are pictured ripping down a homeless man's shack on the Manhattan Bridge on Thursday morning after his dwelling was revealed last month . Removed: The team pulled down the man's belongings from the shack where he has been living for a year . Evicted: The man living inside the bridge is pictured after police arrived on the scene on Thursday . The NYPD said that 'Joey', whose full name was not revealed, asked for the contents of his makeshift home to be thrown away. He also refused any medical attention. For . a year, the man had managed to quietly come and go from his home on the . cyclists' side of the New York City landmark, which connects Manhattan . and Brooklyn. But his hideaway was discovered last month after a . cyclist called 911 saying he thought the man was trying to commit suicide - . when he was actually climbing into the safe confines of his tiny home. The NYPD said that the home had to be demolished because it was dangerous for Joey and for those who use the cycle path of the bridge. MailOnline spoke to him at the home earlier this week and, speaking in heavily-accented English, he offered up his name as Joey and said that he arrived in New York City from China 13 years ago. Belongings: They pulled down his belongings and piled them high in trucks to be discarded . Carted away: His items, including bedding and wood, filled a truck near to the Manhattan Bridge . Stash: The team of police officers pulled down his belongings on Thursday, including electrical items . When asked where he had lived in China . before arriving in the United States, middle-aged Joey said that he had . worked in Shanghai, but had left to try and find a better life in the . United States. Claiming to have suffered a financial loss through gambling, Joey said that for the past year he had called the Manhattan Bridge his home - constructing the base between the girders using wood discarded from nearby Chinatown. Indeed, dotted around the shack built into the bridge was evidence of his shanty construction - wooden boards and used water bottles litter the area. Joey said that there were others who . lived in or near to the bridge - including one woman who had moved her . worldly possessions off the cycling ramp to the entrance of of the famous structure finished in 1912. Looking inside: An image shows the inside of the man's home as officers continue to pull it down . Discovery: Department of Transportation workers help pull down the insides of the man's home . Thrown away: They broke up the wood and pulled down bed sheets and pieces of carpet, pictured . Crowd: Members of the NYPD looked on as officers pulled down items on Thursday morning . Surprisingly . well dressed for a man who lives in a bridge, Joey said that the brutal . winter that New York and the nation just experienced was difficult to . endure. He also said that he was working on a second . shack just 15-feet up the ramp from his current abode. Each of the cramped homes were around ten feet-by-one-and-a-half feet and seemed to be protected with bike locks. The . tiny, narrow dwellings were just big enough for one person to lie down. The living spaces also provided little silence as loud subway trains . rumbled by on four different tracks, 24 hours a day. Emerging: The man who lived in the shack said his name was Joey. He is pictured by his home this week . Looking inside: Water bottles and wooden planks litter the area where 'Joey' built his home on the bridge . Daylight: Earlier this week, 'Joey' explained that he has been coming and going from the home for a year. But a passerby saw him climbing into the home and thought he was committing suicide, so called the cops . Heading home: 'Joey' headed back to his shack to replace his umbrella after it stopped raining . The spot was also poorly lit and well-trafficked with bikers who speed past, not expecting to see a pedestrian on this side of the bridge. Joey likely picked the spot because . it is part of a short expanse of the bike path where there is a roof. There is also no roof over the pedestrian walkway. Last . Sunday a cyclist saw Joey climbing to his rustic nook and mistook him . for a jumper, calling 911 to report what he thought was an impending . suicide. The NYPD . declined to comment to MailOnline regarding the dwellings, and the . Department of Transportation has yet to return a message left seeking . comment. Before: His home, only accessible by the cyclists' lane, was snapped in daylight before it was pulled down . Secret: His home, seen above the cyclists' lane, was accessed by climbing over the steel railings .","On Thursday morning, police officers ripped down the shack that 'Joey' had built into the girders of New York City's Manhattan Bridge .

"By . Dan Bloom . The former headmaster of the £24,000-a-year prep school attended by Boris Johnson has been arrested on suspicion of child sex offences. Clive Williams led Ashdown House school in East Sussex, whose former pupils also include the Homeland actor Damian Lewis, the Queen's nephew Viscount Linley and former Tory chief whip Andrew Mitchell, for almost 30 years. He is understood to be the 69-year-old man who Sussex Police say they arrested and interviewed on Wednesday over alleged sexual assaults and child neglect. Mr Williams was released on bail while investigations continue and is not charged with any offence. Claims: Former pupils have claimed they were abused in the 1970s at Ashdown House prep school, East Sussex (pictured), whose former pupils include Boris Johnson and the Homeland actor Damian Lewis . Pedigree: Former pupils include Homeland actor Damian Lewis (left) and London mayor Boris Johnson (right) A force spokesman said: 'Officers . investigating allegations of historical sexual abuse at a school in East . Sussex have arrested a local man. 'The 69-year-old was arrested on . Wednesday, July 9 on suspicion of sexual assaults and child neglect. A . computer and documentation were seized for examination. 'After being interviewed the man was released on police bail on the same day until November 11 while inquiries continue.' London . mayor Boris Johnson was a boarder at the school - seen as a feeder for . Eton College, which Mr Johnson also attended - with his siblings . including his brother Jo and sister Rachel. A spokesman for the family told The Times: . 'We are all sad to hear this news. We were all four happy at Ashdown . and will always be especially grateful to Clive Williams for his . fantastic teaching.' There is no suggestion that the Johnsons, Mr Lewis, Mr Mitchell or Viscount Linley were among the alleged victims. Mr Williams took the helm of the school near . Tunbridge Wells, Kent, with his wife Rowena in 1975 and remained until . 2003, a time in which the school admitted girls for the first time. Since he left, however, the 170-year-old school has become the centre of allegations of historic sexual abuse. Alumni: The Queen's nephew Viscount Linley (left) and Boris Johnson's brother Jo also attended the school . In . December it emerged two former pupils were suing the school over abuse . they claimed happened in the 1970s and involved 'more than one teacher'. An . email seen by the Daily Mail said: 'The effects of this abuse has . damaged a number of pupils long into adulthood and it is felt among us . that, as part of the healing process, it is important for us to take our . power back and take action against such damaging and horrendous . actions.' Multiple . complaints have been forwarded to officers from Sussex Police's . Operation Mitre who have been in touch with more than 20 alleged . victims, including some who live abroad. 'We have since been in contact with 20 people reporting offences against them. Most . have already been interviewed by officers from our specialist Child . Protection Team' - Sussex Police . The Sussex Police spokesman added: 'During January this year we were contacted by a firm of Solicitors representing a number of clients who have reported to them that they were sexually and physically assaulted by staff whilst they were pupils at Ashdown House School near Forest Row in the 1970's. 'We have since been in contact with 20 people reporting offences against them, including those clients. 'Most have already been interviewed by officers from our specialist Child Protection Team in East Sussex. Arrangements are in hand to interview the others, some of whom live abroad. 'The investigation continues and now spans a period from the late 1960s to the early 1980s. 'We wish to emphasise that there are no current safeguarding issues at the school in relation to this.' The school has said it will co-operate fully with police. The police spokesman added: 'Reports of this kind are always taken seriously, however long ago the offending is said to have occurred. We encourage anybody who has information relevant to this enquiry, including any former pupils who may have been abused at the school during that period and have yet to come forward, to make contact with us. 'At this stage we are not disclosing the number of people against whom allegations have been made, while the enquiry continues.'

"By . Associated Press . and Helen Pow . A Tampa woman tried to manipulate her dead daughter's face into a smile after she allegedly shot her and her teenage brother in a meticulously planned double murder, a doctor told jurors today. During the seventh day of Julie Schenecker's trial in Hillsborough County Court, two doctors said the 53-year-old former military wife had a . plan to kill her children, and cited her journal writings that detailed . the plan as evidence. She . is charged with two counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of . Calyx, her 16-year-old daughter and Beau, her 13-year-old son. The teens . were shot to death while her now ex-Army officer husband was on a . 10-day deployment to the Middle East. On Wednesday, Dr. Randy Otto, a mental health expert called by the prosecution, told the jury . Schenecker told him that she tried to . manipulate Calyx's mouth into a smile after she shot her children. She also covered both the teens' bodies with blankets and kissed them, Otto said. Smile: Julie Schenecker listens Wednesday while her ex-husband, Parker Schenecker testifies during her murder trial. A doctor claimed the mother had manipulated her dead daughter's face into a smile . The . doctors also said the fact that she drove to a gun shop, told a clerk . she wanted a gun so she could protect herself and then returned . following a three-day waiting period was further proof she intended to kill her children. Defense . attorneys say Schenecker suffered from bipolar disorder with psychotic . features and depression, and that she was insane at the time of the . January 2011 deaths. Experts supporting their case claim Schenecker bought the gun with the intent to kill herself rather than her kids. They also said that Schenecker was suffering from 'delusions' that she was 'saving' her children from embarrassment or killing them to save them from future harm or mental illness. Upon . questioning from Schenecker's lawyer, Dr. Donald Taylor did say that . her mental condition was on a downward spiral in the months leading up . to the crime. 'With the benefit of hindsight, it's clear that her mental condition was deteriorating,' he said, adding that she should have been committed to a mental health facility. Yet he maintained that despite that, Schenecker knew what she was doing was wrong. Crazy: A psychologist and psychiatrist testified in the trial of Julie Schenecker on Monday, the 53-year-old Florida mom accused of shooting dead her two teen children in 2011. They both agreed that she was insane at the time of the slayings. Pictured Monday in court . Defense attorneys rested their case on . Tuesday. Schenecker told the judge she won't testify on her behalf. Closing arguments could take place Thursday. The . opinions of the prosecution's medical experts comes after a . psychologist testified in Schenecker's defense Monday, telling the court . she was 'without a doubt' insane at the time of the slayings. Dr Eldra Soloman said he diagnosed the mother as bipolar after spending 20 hours with Schenecker, and reviewing her medical history. 'I think without a doubt that she was insane at the time of the shooting and during the week prior to the shooting,' Dr Solomon told the jury. 'Even psychopaths don't kill their own children.' 'They may be able to kill other people's children, but sane people have it wired in their DNA to protect their children,' she added. Dr Soloman says Schenecker developed severe mental illness after being molested at the age of seven and started to think about suicide when she was just 12 years old. Six months before the killings, Schenecker went off her medications, resulting in a 'downward spiral' which ended with Calyx and Beau's deaths. Around that time, Schenecker started behaving bizarrely, telling her therapist that she wanted to get pregnant at the age of 49 so she could immediately give the child up for adoption. Dr Soloman believes Schenecker wanted to commit suicide, but didn't want to leave her children motherless - fearing that her daughter was becoming bi-polar and that her son would be molested just like her. Failed plan: Schenecker planned to kill herself after shooting dead kids Calyx, 16 (left), and Beau, 13 (right). But the prescription pills she took didn't prove fatal and simply put her to sleep. Her husband was deployed in the Middle East at the time. The two have since divorced . So she decided to kill herself and take 'her children with her to heaven' in order to protect them from the evils of the world. After shooting dead her two children, Schenecker took several pills which put her to sleep - but did not prove lethal. Schenecker's husband and the father of her children, Army Col Parker Schenecker, was deployed in the Middle East at the time and the two have since divorced. When she woke up the next morning, Dr Soloman said Schenecker was very upset. 'She said she was very angry at herself because she failed,' Solomon said. 'She was very upset because she didn't succeed at killing herself.' Forensic psychiatrist Dr Michael Maher also testified and agrees that Schenecker was legally insane at the time of the shootings. 'My conclusion is she knew what she was doing ... but she did not know it was wrong. She believed she was protecting her children from something that was terribly horrible; she believed she was going to stay with her children and bring them with her to heaven, and it was a part of her necessary duty as a mother to do this,' Dr Maher said. Tears: A tear is seen rolling down the face of Julie Schenecker as she talks with her attorney on May 6, 2014 . However, the prosecution has been arguing that the slayings were premeditated, and not the result of a mental breakdown. The jury previously heard recordings of Schenecker telling detectives that her teens were mean and that she hoped they were dead just hours after their bodies were found. 'I just topped over. The last straw,' Schenecker said in the interview, 'My daughter, the 16-year-old, is mouthy. She calls me names.' She told the detective that she had long thought about suicide. 'I feel horrible. I just feel horrible,' she said. 'But I've been thinking about doing this for a long time.' Later, the detective asked her where her kids were. She said that Calyx was in her bed where she had placed her after the shooting, and that Beau was in the family's minivan where she had shot him. 'I hope they're dead,' Schenecker said to police Detective Gary Sandel. 'What do you think?' 'They're dead,' Det Sandel replied. Tampa Police officer Fred Arnold testified that Schenecker's mood was 'jovial' the day of her arrest. 'She wasn't sad or anything like that,' Arnold said. 'She wanted me to give her my gun so she could finish the job.' Schenecker also wrote about her 'disrespectful' children in her journals but Dr Soloman said those were merely 'ramblings'. Schenecker is facing two counts of first-degree murder and has plead not guilty by reason of insanity. If convicted, she will face a life prison sentence without parole; prosecutors declined to seek the death penalty. If acquitted by reason of insanity, the mother would be committed to a hospital until she is no longer a danger to herself or others.

He told NBC Los Angeles that he feels like his heart is destroyed. The driver of the van - who is said to have swerved into the left-hand side and hit the Honda sedan, which was stationary at a stop sign - escaped with only minor injuries.

Federico Gonzalez Magana and Juan Vergara Rodriguez have been charged with possession of $30 million worth of drugs thought to be crystal methamphetamine. The Mexican nationals share the same address and fronted Parramatta Bail Court via video link on Saturday, communicating through a Spanish translator, The Sydney Morning Herald reported. Bail for the pair was refused. They will reappear again in Central Local Court on Wednesday. Scroll down for video . Two alleged Mexican drug dealers were held up at gunpoint in dramatic scenes in Sydney on Friday night . The 49-year-old and a 32-year-old were arrested on Military Road in Neutral Bay, in Sydney's Lower North Shore, in front of school children who filmed the incident after heavily armed police stopped traffic and surrounded their car. Vergara-Rodriguez and Gonzalez-Magama were pulled from a red vehicle, handcuffed and lined up against a shop window. Police said the drugs seized represent 300,000 street deals of meth and the men are allegedly part of a Mexican cartel targeting Australia. Australian Federal Police (AFP) members searched properties in Manly, Pennant Hills and Moore Park and found about 30 kilograms of a substance believed to be crystal meth. They also discovered about two guns and $2 million in Australian cash, suspected to be the proceeds of crime. Armed Federal Police officers stopped traffic in Neutral Bay, Sydney, as they surrounded a car . The men have been charged with drug possession and dealing in the proceeds of crime . The men have been charged with drug possession and dealing in the proceeds of crime, following a joint investigation between the AFP and the Australian Crime Commission (ACC). ACC National Manager Investigations Richard Grant said: 'This is a drug that is ruining lives, wrecking careers and pulling apart families.' 'The ACC and AFP are serious about removing these drugs from our streets, and we will continue to work together to stop organised crime groups from harming the Australian population.' Police said they were arrested after they were supplied with intelligence by the ACC through its Eligo National Task Force, which is tracking illicit money flows in the country. School boys stood by and watched the dramatic scenes unfold next to them . AFP Manager Serious and Organised Crime Commander Scott Lee said the operation was a result of close cooperation and intelligence sharing between the AFP and the ACC. 'This joint-agency operation is testament to our combined determination to stopping criminals from profiting from the importation of drugs into Australia', Commander Lee said. Both men were charged with possessing a commercial quantity of border controlled drugs reasonably suspected of having been imported, and dealing in money reasonably suspected to be proceeds of crime. The maximum penalty for these offences is life imprisonment. Forensic tests are being carried out to confirm the exact weight and purity of the drugs seized, police said.

"By . Sarah Dean . Australia's decathlon hopeful suffered an embarrassing 'schoolboy error' at the Commonwealth Games after not one but two false starts in front of 40,000 people. Jake Stein fluffed his start on the sprinting blocks twice ahead of his 100 metre race in Glasgow on Monday. 'I just went a bit too early – twice – just school boy errors really,' Stein said.

The athlete dropped to the floor at Hampden Park during the Commonwealth Games, in Glasgow, after his second mistake . Stein blamed the second false start on a noise he thought he heard. 'The bloke on my inside was a bit loud and it could have just been him breathing. I knew straight away and punched the ground,' he said. 'I definitely knew it was me, the guys I'm competing against I don’t think they're silly enough to go twice. 'I knew it was me straight away, I could see I was well ahead of everyone and my start is not that good. 'Obviously there were a few nerves being my first senior comp, I got a bit too excited and went twice.'

The sprint race would have added valuable points to his tally and Stein has admitted that he considered ditching the competition after the error. 'For a couple of seconds I was like, 'Do I really want to be here?' And then my mind changed pretty quickly 'yes I do - this is what I have trained for for two years I wanted to get back out on the track’, being inside that stadium is ridiculous, (there are) 40,000 people for (the) decathlon,' he said.

"By . Daniel Mills . Convicted US molester Ed Kramer has been accused of following a Brisbane teenager on Twitter . An American man who was convicted for molesting three teenage boys could spend life behind bars for allegedly following a 14-year-old Brisbane girl on Twitter. Ed Kramer, co-founder of the popular US sci-fi convention Dragon Con, is serving a five-year sentence via house arrest in Georgia after last year pleading guilty to child molestation counts involving three boys aged 13 to 15. A judge deemed that Kramer's poor health warranted his house arrest, rather than prison, because he suffered severe spinal injuries from a jail riot. He was not required to go on trial and  agreed to a plea bargain which ordered him not to have contact 'either direct or indirect with any person under the age of 16'. Now a US District Attorney has alleged he may have broken that agreement by following a young Brisbane girl on Twitter. Kramer was the co-founder of Dragon Con but has since sold his stake in the travelling US comic convention . The American lawyer Danny Porter has been following the convicted molester's movements since 2005 and believes if he is found guilty of allegedly following the 14-year-old he could be jailed for life. Mr Porter told US newspaper, the Gwinnet Daily Post, that Kramer followed some 1,900 people on his Twitter account recently - which has since been deleted -  including the teenager. Mr Porter said the convicted molester's chances of being imprisoned for life, if found guilty, are  'certainly possible.' In January 2011, Kramer joined Twitter under the handle @edwardekramer. He sent a handful of tweets at that time but, for more than three years, the account remained dormant. About two weeks ago, it came back to life but Daily Mail Australia's attempts to locate it have proved unsuccessful and it appears it may have been removed. More...

His lawyers said the 53-year-old science fiction writer and geek culture pioneer maintains his innocence - and only wanted to end the legal case against him because his health couldn't handle the rigors of a trial. His victims have spoken about their treatment at the hands of Kramer, including one teenage boy who told a judge during a December court appearance: 'It doesn’t affect me on a day-to-day basis, but it is paralyzing when it does set in,' he told the judge. This latest accusation leveled against him could lead to a 60-year prison sentence, according to the  the Gwinnet Daily Post, representing 20 years for each count of child molestation Kramer pleaded guilty to in December. Without a violation, he would have about 28 months of a 34-month house arrest sentence left to serve.

"By . Sarah Dean . One of Sydney’s most historic homes is up for sale for $1.2million with its current owner promising any prospective buyers they needn’t worry - it’s no longer haunted. Denfield House in St Helen’s Park, in south-west Sydney, is on the market for $1.2 million. Built in 1837 the house was originally owned by John Farley - the man who first saw Fred Fisher's ghost in 1826. Then a resident female ghost reportedly haunted Denfield's kitchen, she was allegedly a former owner would never go to bed until her husband was ready to join her. Denfield House in St Helen's Park, in south-west Sydney, is on the market for $1.2 million . However, current owner Steve Laws told the Daily Telegraph they had not experienced any supernatural incidents while living there. Fred Fisher was an English-born Australian farmer from Campbelltown who suddenly disappeared in 1826. Four months after he vanished, Farley ran into the local hotel in a very agitated state claiming he had seen Fisher’s ghost sitting on the rail of a nearby bridge. The legend of the ghost is now celebrated in an annual festival in Campbelltown in November and the creek – now a storm water drain - beside which the body was discovered is known as Fisher's Ghost Creek . The typical colonial house has been 'meticulously restored over time to present a wonderful family home' Built in 1837 the house was originally owned by John Farley - the man who first saw Fred Fisher's ghost in 1826 . Farley was an emancipist, one of many of the convicts sentenced and transported under the convict system to Australia who had been given conditional or absolute pardons, and arrived in Australia in 1812. He became a farmer and settled down with his wife Margaret in their new home, located on the 325 acre farm on the Appin Road. Farley died in 1841, a year after he sold the sandstone brick house to magistrate John Bray. The house remained in the Bray family for many years and in 1866 Joshua Bray wrote and described a curious incident in the night. The house remained in the Bray family for many years and in 1866 Joshua Bray wrote and described a curious incident in the night . The house now boasts modern pleasures such as a swimming pool and there's even 'enough room for a pony' 'They are very much excited about here, the Mail was robbed ten days ago....The night before last they stopped it about a quarter of a mile from this house- the coachman and passengers came about 4 o'clock in the morning to tell us. These robberies take place in the night...they were hiding all their jewellery. Papa has loaded his pistol,' he said. The typical colonial house, surrounded by a stone flagged verandah, has been ‘meticulously restored over time to present a wonderful family home’, Ray White real estate agent's website explains. In about 1917 the Hickey’s bought the house and leased it to the Carroll family. It then became derelict until it was restored in 1864. The listing on the Ray White website adds: 'Comprising of four bedrooms plus a study this home comes complete with a variety of different living areas. ‘Feel the warmth of the fireplace in the formal living or enjoy sun filled family areas.'

"By . Sarah Dean . Olympic cycling champion Anna Meares suffered a tough day at the Commonwealth Games on Sunday after she was beaten by teammate Stephanie Morton and was then forced to endure an interview with her former arch rival Victoria Pendleton. Meares came second in the women's sprint track race against 23-year-old Morton, who finally dethroned her in Glasgow. The 30-year-old appeared tearful on the podium after Morton insisted she joined her on the top step to sing the Australian national anthem arm-in-arm. Meares was then approached for an interview by British cycling star Pendleton, with whom she shared a long and fierce rivalry that culminated in a legendary showdown at the 2012 London Olympics. Scroll down for video . Anna Meares looked emotional (L) as she stood alongside gold medallist Stephanie Morton (R) on the podium to sing their national anthem after the women's sprint track cycling event in the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome in Glasgow . 'There were rumours flying that this was your last championship, please tell me they are just rumours?,' Pendleton asked after commenting on Meares' emotional appearance. The retired Olympian was reporting for for BBC 5 Live Sport at the velodrome in Glasgow. 'I'm a little stunned that you are here actually, I didn't expect to see your face here,' Meares laughed awkwardly. 'It was very emotional. Steph broke me on the podium, I wanted to happily stand in my place on second spot but she insisted I stand with her for the anthem,' she said. 'I don't know if I'll get to another Commonwealth Games, I'm aiming for Rio,' she added. The pair put any tension aside to pose for a photo in front of the track, which Meares posted on Twitter. Meares was interviewed by her former rival Victoria Pendleton (L), who has now retired, after she came second in the sprint race . 'I'm a little stunned that you are here actually, I didn't expect to see your face here,' Meares laughed as she was interviewed by Pendleton . Anna Meares (left) and Victoria Pendleton (right) clash in the sprint event at the London 2012 Olympic Games, where Meares won gold and upset Pendleton's retirement party. The pair were arch rivals for years, including some high-profile race incidents that contributed to some bad blood between the cyclists . Meares famously beat Pendleton on her home patch when she emerged victorious in the sprint final two years ago in London. Meares on that occasion played the spoiler for the retiring Pendleton who, in an act of sportsmanship, embraced the Australian during her victory lap to bury the hatchet. Their rivalry stretches back many years and has at times flared up on the world stage. Meares tried to run Pendleton off the track during a keirin race in France in 2006, but the Briton got her own back two years later when she won the gold Medal in Beijing. Eyebrows were again raised when Pendleton crashed out during a duel in Melbourne in 2009 but backed up to score a bittersweet victory in the decider. She then accused Meares and a hostile Melbourne crowd of bad sportsmanship. 'I hate the rivalry, absolutely hate it, mainly because it has turned into something which sounds bitter and nasty, and I don’t like the idea,' she said in 2012, according to The Mirror. 'I didn't like the way her crowd in Melbourne were all quiet when I was up and jeering when I had won. I hate that negative side of it - what happened to good sportsmanship?' Speaking after Monday morning's race - the first time the old rivals have spoken since London - it was clear the pair had long forgotten the past when Pendleton told Meares: 'I really enjoyed watching you up there'. 'Sometimes I fall short and get a silver medal like I did tonight,' Meares said. 'Mate, there is no shame in a silver medal if anyone knows I know that,' Pendleton replied. Australia's Anna Meares (R) and Stephanie Morton (L) acknowledge the crowd after the latter crossed the finish line first . Australia's Stephanie Morton (L) congratulated by Meares after Gold in the Sprint finals at the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome . 'Couldn't believe seeing this face again on the other side of the fence tonight So good 2 see u @v_pendleton @bbc5live,' she wrote. Meares previously praised Pendleton when she beat her at the London 2012 Olympic Games. She told journalists after her win it gave them a 'break from being so tentative towards each other'. 'Last night Victoria showed great sportsmanship. It would have been very difficult to have been beaten in front of a home crowd, especially one as patriotic and as loud as that,' she said. The pair showed there were no hard feelings between them as they kissed on the podium . Meares (L) looked emotional as she touched her silver medal while Samantha Morton (R) looked overjoyed with her gold . Meanwhile, on Sunday night Morton said after her win 'there is really nothing between me and Mearesy, we’re really good friends off the track and I have the utmost respect for her on the track as well, and we’ll probably ride home (to the village) together.' The pair are sharing a room together at the athletes' village in Glasgow.

"By . Daniel Mills . More than five months after an Aboriginal woman was shot by a police officer armed with a Taser gun, blinding her left eye, Queensland police are yet to reveal the findings of an investigation into the officer who fired it. Sheila Oakley was hit inside her home, in Logan, south of Brisbane, during an altercation with police back in February. Soon after, the state's Ethical Standards Command launched an investigation set-up to explore the conduct of the officer who fired the weapon, and whether the police officer's claim of self defence was justified. Sheila Oakley was struck with a taser fired by a police officer, leaving her blind in one eye. The officer, who was a skilled taser user and trainer, alleged Ms Oakley was threatening police with a table leg which had nails protruding from it. But the case, now more than five months in, is still being investigated and civil libertarian and criminal lawyer Terry O'Gorman wants to know why. Mr O'Gorman has questioned a lack of urgency by police and has demanded that the Queensland Police Commissioner Ian Stewart give reasons why the investigation has taken so long. 'It's an unacceptably long time': Lawyer Terry O'Gorman claims the investigation by Queensland police is lagging. 'Why has it taken since February? It's now July,' he told ABC. 'Why has it taken so long for such a straightforward issue to be investigated.' He said 'It's an unacceptably long time' and has accused police of delaying the investigation on the grounds that the case is not 'high profile.' 'The fact is that when police want to, (they) pump resources into high profile issues that they choose. 'In relation to complaints against police, they are given a low priority. They are deliberately delayed in the hope that journalists will forget it, and in the hope that complainants will just get sick of the delay and give up.' The investigation was launched immediately after the February incident. Mr O'Gorman who has met with Ms Oakley said she is still waiting to hear of the outcome of that investigation. Police have said there is still one further witness to be interviewed and a final report is expected to be completed by July 30.","Sheila Oakley was left blind when Taser lodged in her eye in February .

"By . Daniel Mills . Scott Morrison has confirmed that 41 asylum seekers have been sent back home to Sri Lanka . The Australian Government has ignored calls from the opposition and human rights groups and returned 41 asylum seekers to Sri Lanka. Immigration Minister Scott Morrison has received a lashing for his handling of the issue from all sides of government, including former Liberal Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser, who said the return of asylum seekers at sea was similar to how Jews were treated by the Nazis back in the 1930s. The news has also outraged Labor frontbencher Penny Wong who has hit out at Mr Morrison's 'brief statement' which confirmed asylum seekers had been intercepted back in June, and now some where being returned back to Sri Lanka. 'Australians also expect that their government complies with what are ethical and legal obligations, which are not to return people to the risk of persecution,' she told ABC radio. Mr Morrison said 41 asylum seekers, of Sinhalese and Tamil background, were transferred to Sri Lankan authorities in mild sea conditions just outside the Port of Batticaloa, off the coast of Sri Lanka. He is yet to comment on the status of another boat of asylum seekers, said to be carrying about 150 asylum seekers, which was reportedly intercepted by Australian authorities around a week ago at Cocos Islands near Christmas Island. Mr Morrison said of the 41 returned on Sunday: 'All persons intercepted and returned were subjected to an enhanced screening process, as also practiced by the previous government, to ensure compliance by Australia with our international obligations under relevant conventions,"" Mr Morrison said in a statement on Monday. Border security transferred the asylum seekers back to Sri Lankan authorities on Sunday . But according to many, the Sri Lankans could face torture, rape and even death once they are returned home. Australian Greens leader Christine Milne also said the Government's actions were against international law and decency. 'It's absolutely appalling,' she told reporters. Independent senator Nick Xenophon says he is 'uneasy' with the Government's actions and wants the returned Sri Lankans monitored to ensure they do not come to any harm. Mr Morrison has not indicated how the asylum seekers will be treated once they return. The transfer comes after 203 Sri Lankan asylum seekers were reportedly believed to be intercepted by Australian authorities in late June.

"By . James Gordon . A hunter from Maine has shown off his softer side as he managed to deliver a baby porcupine after seeing its mother flattened by a car. Jared Buzzell was on his way to search for mushrooms with medicinal properties in woods near Minot when he saw the car in front strike the porcupine dead. At the time of its death, he did not know the animal was pregnant but decide to slice her open in his search for a rare stone found in the animals stomach. Saved: This cute little fella was found inside his pregnant mother and was saved by a passing motorist on the roads in Maine . Savior: Jarred Buzzell Maine inadvertently delivered a baby porcupine by what amounted to emergency C-section after its mother was killed by car . Attention: Now Jarred has taken it upon himself to look after the baby porcupine and nurse it back to health . First steps: The little animal will be with the Buzzell family for a few more days before being handed over to a rehabilitation center . Time consuming: Baby porcupines require feeding every two to three hours . Jared had been told by his uncle that a valuable mineral forms in a porcupine's stomach, so when he realized the animal was dead, he said he cut it open to have a look inside - and it was then he found a baby Porcupine. The mineral deposit is called a bezoar stone that forms in the stomach of porcupines. Jared Buzzell said he was on his way to search for mushrooms in Minot, which he collects for medicinal purposes . He said he saw the car in front of him hit a porcupine and slowed down to check on it . Buzzell said his uncle had told him a valuable mineral will form in a porcupine's stomach, so when he realized the animal was dead, he said he cut it open to look inside . Hunter: He said he knows the story sounds bizarre, but is glad he checked to see if his uncle's story was true, because it saved the baby animal's life . A bezoar stone, or 'date,' is a tightly packed undigested or partially undigested mineral deposit stuck in the stomach or intestinal tract of animals. They can consist of hairs, fruit and vegetables, seeds or other hardened objects and are used in Chinese herbal medicine, as they are thought to cure a range of illnesses from diabetes to cancer. Bezoar literally means . 'antidote' in Persian. Bezoars were sought because they were believed to have the power of a universal antidote against any poison. It was believed that a drinking glass which contained a bezoar would neutralize any poison poured into it. Porcupines are herbivores that feast on plants and tree bark. They also love salt and are 'attracted to objects that have salty human sweat on them, such as ax handles, boat oars,' as well as frequently gnaw on dropped deer antlers for minerals. Hunters are permitted to trap porcupines year-round in Maine, but not permitted to keep them as pets without a license, the Maine Wildlife and Fisheries Department. Instead of a bezoar stone, Jared found a baby porcupine inside . 'I . cut the sack open and out fell the porcupine. I cut the umbilical cord, . put it in a hat. We thought it was dead - then I started massaging it . and all kinds of stuff starting coming out of its lungs so it started . breathing,' he said. Jared is now looking after the cuddly creature that he delivered by c-section, until it can be given to animal rescue in the next couple of days. The baby porcupine requires a great deal of attention and needs to be fed every two to three hours. He has been using baby formula and his daughter's toy baby doll bottle to help it regain its strength, according to ABC News. Jared says that he is glad his uncle told him the story about the rare stone because otherwise he would not have bothered to look inside, nor have saved a life. Although his wife and kids want to keep the adorable animal, Jared believes the 'pocupette' stands the best chance of survival if it is handed over to a wildlife rehabilitator. Saved: Buzzell said his uncle had told him a valuable mineral will form in a porcupine's stomach, so when he realized the animal was dead, he said he cut it open to look inside . He's now taken it upon himself to look after the baby until it can be given to an animal rescue in the next couple of days . Buzzell said the porcupine will be taken to an animal rescue in the next couple of days even though his wife wants to keep it as a pet .","Jared Buzzell saw the mother porcupine get hit by a car and stopped to investigate .

"By . James Gordon . When you're trying to steal a car, there is one requirement that is needed: an ability to drive. One would-be car thief in Omaha, Nebraska, fell at the first hurdle after breaking his way into one family's car. He wasn't able to back the Dodge Caliber out of the driveway because he had never learned how to drive stick-shift. Scroll down for video... Foiled: A man attempting to steal a Nebraska family car didn't get very far after finding out he couldn't drive the vehicle he was trying to make off with because it wasn't automatic . Wanted: Mganga Mganga, 17, the teenager spent almost ten minutes in the car before surrendering to police when he realized he would unable to drive away . Theo Peters who owned the car watched as the hapless driver fumbled around with the controls but was unable to make the car budge an inch. Lights went on and off - and even the windscreen wipers began to move, but the car stayed still. It happened early on Thursday morning as Mr Peters watched as his wife Melissa headed over towards the car, to take their teenage son to school. 'She jumped out and ran back into the house,' Mr Peters said. 'The thief was sitting in the car like he didn't care.' 'I looked out the window and she was hollering and stuff and saying he had a gun!' 'My first priority is, of course, my kid,' Melissa Peters said. She went around to the car's passenger side where her son was sitting. 'I opened the door. He got out. We started running. I was hollering up a storm.' For about 15 minutes, Mr Peters said he watched the teen struggle to drive off in the family car. Watched: Theo Peters watched his wife Melissa and 13-year-old son run from the car as they realized there was an armed thief already inside . Stumped: The 17-year-old thief was unable to shift the car out of neutral and ended up being stuck in the driveway . 'He looked and you could see the car lights coming on. He tried to crank the car, but it wouldn't go nowhere.' Mr Peters called 911 for the police to come and deal with the dumb driver. Eight minutes later, he was still sitting in the car until finall the cops arrived on the scene. The carless crook attempted to make a run for it but was eventually caught by police. Thursday afternoon, police identified the suspect as Mganga Mganga, 17. Mganga has been charged with three counts of robbery and three counts of use of a deadly weapon to commit a felony in connection with incidents last year. He is out on $10,000 bail. Caught: The would-be car thief did end up having a ride in the end... to the police station . Caught: Lt Michael McGee from Omaha Police Department says there are some benefits to driving a manual car and this is one of them . 'For those of you who still have stick shift vehicles there is an advantage in today's time,' said Omaha Police Department Lt. Mike McGee. 'Young people don't know how to drive them.' Mr Peters said he and his wife saw Mganga walking around the neighborhood on Wednesday. His wife thought it was suspicious, but Peters said he thought the teen was just waiting for someone to pick him up. In the end it was the police that picked him up.","Would-be thief had been seen in the neighborhood days earlier .

"By . Daniel Mills . Chantelle Newbery was Australia's first female 10-metre diving champion when she won gold at Athens in 2004 . An Olympic diver who made history for ending an 80-year gold medal drought for Australians in the sport, has escaped conviction during a Queensland court appearance for drug possession. Chantelle Newbery, 37, was placed on a drug diversion program after pleading guilty to drug charges when she was arrested at a Lota property, east of Brisbane, for failing to dispose of syringes and possession of methylamphetamine on March 28 this year. The 37-year-old champion diver, who won a gold medal at Athens in 2004, pleaded guilty in the Cleveland Magistrates Court on Thursday to both charges. She won Australia's first gold medal in diving in 80 years, and was the first Australian woman ever to win gold at the elite level. But Newbery, who Diving Australia CEO David Bell said struggled with personal battles, soon lost touch with the sport about a year ago when she split from the organisation where she was the national talent ID coordinator. 'We're certainly aware of some of her issues and have even recently been offering support to her.' He said the organisation had been attempting to counsel the 37-year-old, but has not been able to get in contact to offer its support. 'At this stage we haven't been in contact for a little while ... we haven't had any reply from her. We'll always continue to offer support to Chantelle should she request it, he said. More...

"By . Ruth Styles . Prince Charles is famous for his passion for all things gardening but it seems the prince isn't the only green-fingered member of the royal family. Equally passionate is the Duchess of Cornwall who today showed off her gardening skills as she planted a sapling during a visit to an arboretum in Gloucestershire. Greeted by a cheering crowd of locals, Camilla was on fine form as she toured the woodland venue which recently opened a new visitor centre. Green-fingered: Camilla is shown how to propagate a tree sapling during her visit to Westonbirt Arboretum . Despite her elegant pale ensemble, which included a a nude cropped jacket and a pleated cream skirt, Camilla was happy to risk a dirty smear of soil or two as she smilingly stopped to try her hand at planting. The arboretum, which is managed by the Forestry Commission, recently opened a new visitor centre to help it deal with the increasing number of people attending its Forest Live concerts. Recent acts to take to the woodland stage include 90s rockers Suede, girl group Little Mix and veterans Boyzone. While the Duchess of Cornwall might not have had the same impact on decibel levels, she did stop to make an equally well-received speech and officially opened the visitor centre before learning how to propagate plants from cuttings. Looking good: Camilla looked wonderful in a neat cream pleated skirt and nude jacket . All smiles: Staff at Westonbirt looked thrilled as they showed the royal visitor around the woodland site . Afterwards, the Duchess was driven to Trowbridge, where she officially opened the new county hall before touring the building and meeting excited staff. Later the Duchess' day will end with a glamorous trip to the National Portrait Gallery, where she will open a display of recent portraits by the British artist Catherine Goodman. The artistic director of The Prince's Drawing School and winner of the BP Portrait Award 2002, Goodman's expressive portraits of family and friends are designed to reflect the inner - as well as outer - world of the sitter. Notable subjects include film director Stephen Frears, author and broadcaster Daisy Goodwin, novelist Vikram Seth and royal photographer Arthur Edwards, all of which will be included in the exhibition. The Duchess of Cornwall and the Prince of Wales are set to have a busy few weeks, with scheduled visits to Wimbledon and a pottery among the engagements lined up. Next week will also see the royal couple visit Wales and spend a week there, with visits to a local cheese factory and a war memorial scheduled in. Nice day for a speech!

"By . Daniel Mills . A man who complained he didn't get a fair trial because the judge presiding over the case kept falling asleep, will get the chance to appeal his lengthy jail sentence for brutally bashing a man more than a decade ago. The family of Paul Duncan, who was sentenced to 16 years for permanently disabling a man during a brawl in Wollongong on the NSW south coast, has won a successful appeal claiming that District Court Judge Ian Dodd was 'constantly dozing off' during parts of his 2003 trial. Duncan's family have spent years during his incarceration trying to get a successful appeal, which was last week granted by NSW Supreme Court Justice Richard Button. After years of unsuccessful attempts,  prisoner Paul Duncan has been been granted an appeal for his 2003 sentencing . Justice Button referred his case to the Criminal Court of Criminal Appeal on the grounds that Duncan feels he experienced a 'sense of unease' about how his trial was originally handled by Mr Dodd, who the family said was asleep during important proceedings of his trial. The Daily Telegraph reported on Sunday that Duncan's family accused the judge of having 'his hands clasped together and his head dropped down' during the trial which led to his lengthy jail term. Duncan's mother, Linda Machman, said she also heard Dodd snoring in evidence she provided to the NSW Supreme Court. The case will now be heard in the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal on July 17. It is not the first time that Judge Dodd has been accused of falling asleep during trials he has presided over, which have led to a conviction. More...

Oscar Pistorius trial: Chilling leaked footage emerges showing athlete re-enacting moment he shot Reeva Steenkamp . In 2008 the High Court ordered a retrial of two men, accused of drug smuggling, after it found Judge Dodd suffered from sleep apnoea and had fallen asleep during the pair's trial. It was reported at the time court officials and lawyers sometimes loudly dropped documents in a bid to wake the snoring judge, and the two accused, Rafael Cesan and Ruben Rivadavia claimed they could not have had a fair hearing because he dozed off so often. In his appeal evidence, accused drug smuggler Rafael Cesan said the judge's snoring was disruptive when he was being cross-examined. The High Court agreed that Judge Dodd did not exercise supervision of the trial as required by law and, as a result, the jury was distracted. 'Where the judge is noticeably and repeatedly asleep or inattentive during the trial, there can be a miscarriage of justice,' said Chief Justice Robert French. 'The trial in this case was so flawed. There was a miscarriage of justice. It could not be said that the miscarriage was not substantial. 'It was revealed after the men's trial that Judge Dodd suffered from sleep apnoea, a condition which brings on pauses in breathing during the night, the disturbed sleep resulting in daytime tiredness and fatigue. It resulted in a miscarriage of justice, but during a retrial in the District Court the two men were found guilty.

"By . Luke Salkeld . Cleared: PC Jonathan Johnson, 44, was cleared of assault after it was revealed a gang who accused him of punching them had made it all up . After 23 years in the force,  PC Jonathan Johnson had an unblemished record and many awards for bravery. But that did not protect him when two foul-mouthed teenagers falsely accused him of assault. On the strength of their accounts, the 44-year-old was suspended for a year and faced all the stress of a court case – which fell apart on Monday as a judge said their stories were ‘full of discrepancies, inaccuracies and untruths’. District Judge Bodfan Jenkins added: ‘It’s not possible to rely on anything these witnesses say.’ Throwing out the case, he told the prosecution to pay all defence costs and criticised the Crown Prosecution Service. The false claims related to two incidents last July, in one of which the ‘outstanding’ PC was pelted with rocks and sworn at. Lee Dixon, then 17, and a 13-year-old who cannot legally be named said he assaulted them as he warned gangs of youths who were trespassing at a water-filled quarry. The first time he went, 30 youths pelted him with rocks and shouted: ‘Go and f*** yourself.’ PC Johnson gave the 13-year-old a ‘good old-fashioned telling off about swearing’ – but the boy later claimed the officer punched him in the ribs. The next day, he faced another group in the same area and had to push Dixon, who was aggressive, in self-defence. Both boys complained and he was taken off front-line duties. Almost a year later, the married father-of-two finally gave Cardiff magistrates’ court his version of events at the Wenvoe Quarry. PC Johnson said: ‘In the two months leading up to this I had been to two drownings . . . I was extremely worried someone was going to drown. That water would have been like ice and deadly.’ Incident: Pc Johnson said he was genuinely concerned for the safety of the teenagers as they swam in the disused Wenvo Quarry near Cardiff (pictured) but the gang pelted him with rocks and told him to 'f*** off' Of the first occasion, he said: ‘There was one lad in particular who was vociferous with his language. His abuse was too much – repeatedly being told to “f*** off” and “go and f*** myself” . . . I gave him a strong telling off.’ The next day, PC Johnson was moving a group of older teens. He asked Dixon, now 18, if he could look at his pitbull-type dog to check it was not the banned breed. He said: ‘Dixon came over the top of the quarry bank raging towards me. He was ranting and raving and said I “wouldn’t be taking his f****** dog”. ‘He came directly towards me very quickly with his head down and my initial thought was he was going to head-butt me. ‘He came right up to me and his head almost made contact. I was shocked at how the situation escalated so quickly and I had to do something. I pushed him away with both hands to the chest but he came straight back again. ‘I pushed him again and was shouting at him to keep back and calm down.’ Dixon sat down, ‘crying and hyperventilating’, the court heard. He later claimed the officer had slapped him. Unblemished record: Pc Johnson had received bravery commendations, including for tackling a thug with a knife, but faced ruin had the case against him at Cardiff Magistrates' Court (pictured) not collapsed . PC Stewart Elson, who saw the incident, said: ‘Dixon’s attitude was aggressive and belligerent and he went face to face with PC Johnson. I saw PC Johnson grab him by both arms and say: “Sit on the bank”.’ PC Johnson was acquitted of both assault charges, and can go back to his job at the South Wales Police dog handling unit. Judge Jenkins said: ‘There was no assault on anyone . . . It’s not possible to rely on anything these witnesses say.’ He said the CPS ‘shot [itself] in the foot’ by bringing the case even though it had accepted PC Elson’s statement. He added that Dixon, who has past convictions for wounding and being drunk and disorderly, was ‘not telling the truth’. A CPS spokesman said: ‘We note the comments of the District Judge . . . We are committed to ensuring all cases we bring before the courts are presented fairly and professionally.’ The court was told PC Johnson has had a glittering career. He has received at least six commendations for bravery – for acts such as wrestling a knife attacker and disarming him, arresting a man who had two firearms in a high street, and tackling a thief while off duty. He received an excellence award for talking down a suicidal woman. He was a finalist for a Force Award for exceptional bravery and ran seven marathons in seven days for charity Barnardo’s.","PC Jonathan Johnson was suspended from duties over false accusations .

"By . Ruth Styles . With their blonde good looks and strapping build, Danish men such as Game of Thrones star Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, 43, have long been considered among the most handsome in Europe. But women don't just want to date them: They want to have 'Viking babies' too, with Danish sperm now accounting for a third of the total used by British fertility clinics. And the UK isn't the only place where Danish sperm sales are booming - women from all over the world are choosing to go Scandinavian when they need a sperm donor. In demand: More and more British women are giving birth to 'Viking babies' helped by Danish sperm banks . Main attraction: Like Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, the Danes' blonde good looks have proved popular . 'I went to a conference where someone from the Nordic Ethics Committee showed a slide,' chuckles  Anne Mette Arndal-Lauritzen, who heads the Copenhagen-based European Sperm Bank. 'He said: ""These are the main Danish export products - beer, Lego and sperm!""' So why are so many British women going Danish? According to Dr Alan Pacey, a fertility expert at the University of Sheffield, one of the reasons is a shortage of homegrown sperm. 'We don't have enough donors in the UK to . meet the national need,' he explains. 'We . don't have the clinic infrastructure sufficient to recruit enough . donors - even when men want to donate. 'Often there simply isn't the size . and scale within small NHS clinics to consider having a donor . recruitment programme - plus if you're not confident that sufficient men . are going to ring up and become sperm donors, the economics of it simply . aren't going to work. 'The NHS is used to treating patients and you get a . fee for treating patients. You don't get a fee for screening a donor . that you may not ultimately accept.' Compounding . the problem for British clinics is the 2005 law that forces men to . waive their anonymity, meaning sperm donors face the prospect of . offspring turning up on their doorstep once they reach the age of 18. Nevertheless, although Danish clinics, . among them the world's largest sperm bank, Cryos, cannot sell semen from . anonymous donors to British women, business is booming thanks to the . huge numbers of local men happy to sign up anyway. Looking good: Handsome Borgen star Pilou Asbaek, 32, has helped fuel British demand for half-Danish babies . While controversies for Danish sperm banks are few and far between, one of the more amusing concerned a bumper crop of sperm sourced from red-headed men. When, in September 2011, Copenhagen's largest sperm bank Cryos announced it had stopped accepting ginger sperm, the world's flame-haired community was outraged. Cryos then followed up with an unusual special offer for Scottish parents - a 15 per cent discount for those who plumped for red. Speaking to the Scottish Sun, director Ole Schou said: 'We would be more than happy to supply to people in Scotland who are looking for a child with red hair. 'We currently have too many donors for the first time ever and I know red hair is particularly popular in places like Scotland and Ireland. 'We are always open to negotiation. Scottish clinics could get a discount of five, 10 or 15 per cent.' 'My parents think its a bit weird,' admits twenty-something donor John, who has waived his anonymity and is responsible for some of the sperm dispatched to UK clinics. 'My father has said a few times: ""What am I going to do in 20 years when somebody comes knocking on my door and says Grandpa!"" 'I've spoken to them and said that it's not likely to happen, and if it does happen, it's not a bad situation. It might be a good thing.' Like other Danish donors, he is a regular visitor to the European Sperm Bank, which, according to its boss, does well because it focuses purely on semen. 'This is the only thing we do,' explains Arndal-Lauritzen. 'We don't . do eggs, we don't do anything else. We just do sperm and sperm donation . and that allows us to focus on what we do.' Although the prospect of cash payments is an incentive for some, other donors say its the prospect of helping childless families conceive that brings them to Arndal-Lauritzen's door. 'I . haven't got a lot of money and I need it,' explains John. 'But I think I would be . 10 times more happy about doing this if I could see some kind of . reaction, some kind of pay-off in the happiness of these people. 'It's . a good purpose and it helps people who cannot have children. Instead of . donating blood, you could do this instead and make people happy.' 'It would be nice if there were 100, 200 . children that are half me,' chuckles fellow donor Adam, a married professional in his late 30s. 'I think it's funny to think about how many . children I can make.' But availability isn't the only reason so many British women want to bear a half-Danish child. For many, the Danes' handsome blue-eyed, blonde looks and 'dependable natures' are just as attractive. 'The blonde hair and the blue eyes . appeal,' laughs one mother who conceived with the help of a Danish . clinic. 'The cheekbones as well I think!' Father of hundreds: For sperm donors like John and Adam, their children could number in the hundreds . Choice: Denmark's sperm banks, among them Cryos, deploy excellent customer service to help boost sales . Experts such as Laura Witjens, CEO of the National Gamete Donation Trust, say the excellent customer service deployed by Copenhagen's sperm banks has also contributed to the Viking baby boom. 'It's much easier for a British clinic to . order sperm from Denmark which is Fed-exed the next day than to . try and recruit their own donors and all the hassle that goes with them,' says Witjens. 'The . Danish model is customer service driven. It knows how to deal well with . customers, it has a good website, and that's what we could do in the UK . as well - it's not rocket science.' 'Denmark is geographically close to the . UK,' adds Dr Pacey. 'I think there's some sort of philosophical and intellectual bond . that we have with Denmark.' Jo, a British woman who became mother to a son, Euan, with her partner Sarah, agrees and says she plans to teach her little boy about his Danish heritage when the time comes.

"By . Luke Salkeld . Army hopeful: Jordan was airlifted to hospital where he is being treated for serious serious injuries to his hands . A teenager who wanted to join the Army is believed to have lost both hands in an explosion at his home. Jordan Smith, 19, was airlifted to hospital with serious injuries after the blast at his parents’ luxury barn conversion. A bomb disposal squad was called in and four neighbouring homes were evacuated until the area could be checked. The cause of the explosion was not known last night. Police say they are not looking for anyone else in relation to the blast. Neighbours said they knew little of Mr Smith’s interests, but it later emerged that his Facebook page features slogans such as ‘No more mosques’, ‘We hate Muslim extremists’ and ‘No surrender to Al Qaeda’, as well as references to the English Defence League. One fellow resident of Wiston, a village in Pembrokeshire, Wales, claimed the teenager had joined the Army last year but did not complete his basic training because he ‘was not focused properly’. Bernie Jones, 67, said: ‘The Army is definitely his orientation – he was very keen.’ Mr Smith had previously done an Army preparation course at Pembrokeshire College and was often seen wearing camouflage gear. Mr Jones said: ‘There was some sort of an explosion and it looks like Jordan has suffered bad hand injuries. Police threw a cordon up around the entire village and the bomb squad moved in.’ Mr Smith came to the village six years ago from Stoke-on-Trent with his parents Anthony and Rita, who until recently were directors of a cleaning company. Another neighbour said that he had heard an explosion at around 11am on Thursday. He added: ‘The helicopter was soon overhead and landed in a field next to the house.’ Villager Fiona Morgan, 27, said: ‘Neighbours said there was an almighty bang and a bad smell. There’s been a lot of police and sniffer dogs. ‘It’s a really, really sleepy and quiet village. It’s very peaceful normally – just a lovely place to be.’ Mr Smith was last night in a stable condition at Morriston Hospital in Swansea. However, there were fears that he might lose both hands. Army hopeful: Jordan, pictured in his Army fatigues, was airlifted to hospital where he is being treated for serious serious injuries to his hands. He is said to be in a stable condition . Sealed off: Police cordoned off Jordan's family home in Wiston, Pembrokeshire, and the surrounding area following the explosion at 11am on Thursday . Investigation: Bomb disposal experts were sent to the scene in the village of Wiston. Police confirmed they are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident . A spokesman for Dyfed Powys police described his injuries as ‘non-life threatening’ and said that their investigation is continuing. She added: ‘The safety of all in the area is our priority, and the small number of residents who were evacuated have not been allowed back to their homes at this time. ‘Explosive Ordnance Disposal attended the scene to provide their specialist skills and knowledge and to ensure safety of those at the scene, but have left. ‘Police are not looking for anyone else in connection with this matter.’ Searches and enquiries were set to continue for most of yesterday evening, she said.

"By . Jack Doyle . and Luke Salkeld . Pamela Young has condemned 'soft touch' justice after judges upheld a four-year sentence for Lewis Gill, 21, who killed her son with a single punch . The mother of an Asperger’s sufferer killed with one punch condemned the ‘soft touch’ justice system that has upheld his attacker’s short sentence. Andrew Young, 40, died after Lewis Gill smashed him in the face in an unprovoked attack. Yesterday the Court of Appeal ruled Gill’s four-year term was not unduly lenient even though the 21-year-old is likely to serve just half of that. The decision sparked public anger and Mr Young’s mother Pamela said it showed criminals were not being held to account. The 71-year-old added: ‘In this country people can get away with anything, not through the police, but through the courts. ‘My sympathies are with the police who do a brilliant job. The police have done their duty but the judicial system hasn’t. The judicial system is a soft touch. ‘I didn’t think it was justice for Andrew at the time but it’s now gone to the highest court in the land. If the highest court says that’s OK then I respect that. ‘It’s best not to have any revenge. If you have revenge in your mind the only person you will hurt is yourself.’ Asked if justice would had been served with a longer term, she said: ‘I suppose it would. It won’t bring Andrew back.’ Her son, who had a mental age of 14, was attacked in a Bournemouth street last November 6 when he challenged Gill’s friend for riding his bicycle on the pavement. Gill, a convicted robber and trained boxer, turned back and punched Mr Young square in the face. He fell backwards, fracturing his skull, and died the next day in Southampton Hospital with his mother at his side. The horrifying incident was caught on CCTV. Scroll down for video . Asperger's sufferer Andrew Young, 40 (right), was killed with a single blow from 21-year-old Lewis Gill after an altercation in Bournemouth last year . Gill was given a four-year sentence in February after admitting manslaughter. But, following dozens of complaints, Attorney General Dominic Grieve referred the sentence to the Court of Appeal. Yesterday he told the court the term did not reflect the extent of Gill’s ‘gratuitous, unprovoked violence’. But three senior judges disagreed. Lord Justice Treacy said it was ‘within the reasonable range available to the trial judge’. However he added: ‘We readily understand that this is the sort of case that arouses public concern. 'If there are public concerns going beyond this case then it may well be appropriate for the wider issue to be the subject of detailed consideration and consultation by the Sentencing Council. ‘It is open to the Secretary of State for Justice or other interested bodies to invite the Sentencing Council to do so.’ Justice Secretary Chris Grayling immediately announced a full review. He told the Daily Mail: ‘I want to ensure that everyone can have full confidence in the sentencing of these crimes, which is why I am asking the Sentencing Council to look at whether further guidance is necessary. The death of Andrew Young (left) prompted a review after a string of complaints, but three senior judges yesterday upheld the decision at the Court of Appeal meaning killer Gill (right0 could be released in two years . ‘Manslaughter is an extremely serious offence that already carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. Compared to five years ago, the average sentence length for this offence has increased by almost 50 per cent.’ Baroness Newlove of Warrington, who is the victims’ commissioner, said: ‘This was a horrific act of violence and my heart truly goes out to Andrew’s family and friends.’ Only a day after the case gained widespread publicity, Gill’s mother dismissed her son’s crime as ‘no big deal’. Sherron O’Hagan said she did not know ‘what all the fuss was about’ and claimed her son was a ‘good kid’. Speaking from her home in Sutton, south London, she claimed the death was an ‘accident’ and would ‘all be forgotten tomorrow’.","Asperger's sufferer Andrew Young, 40, killed with single punch last year .

"By . Luke Salkeld . A group of travellers have won the right to stay on land under a motorway flyover - with new toilets installed at taxpayers’ expense. Council officials had tried to evict the travellers, but were beaten by a court injunction. The O’Brien family pitched up on the site near the M5 six weeks ago after they were apparently turfed off a nearby council-run site when their tenancy ended. Legal victory: A group of travellers has won the right to stay on land under a flyover on the M5, with portable toilets installed at taxpayers' expense . Bristol City Council applied for an eviction order but the travellers - who say they have nowhere to go - had already got an injunction blocking the order. Last week the council’s High Court bid to get the injunction removed was dismissed. Now bosses have been forced to install portaloos at the site in Shirehampton, Bristol, after locals threatened to collect excrement in the area and take it to local politicians’ homes. The call for loos at the site under the M5 motorway came from Steve Norman, an independent council candidate from nearby Avonmouth. His request, prompted by residents’ complaints about human waste, was initially refused by Nick Hooper, the council director responsible for gypsies and travellers. Mr Hooper wrote in an email: ‘It is vital that we do not create any impression that the Council is sanctioning the use of this land for travellers by installing facilities.’ But in a fiery reply, Mr Norman said: ‘I feel sure I could muster up enough fellow constituents to clean-up and bag the excrement free of charge and deliver it to yours and [Bristol] Mayor Ferguson’s abodes. ‘Clearly it is your intentions to take us back to the dark ages in Shirehampton/Avonmouth because deciding to act otherwise will give the wrong “impression”.’ After the council lost its court application last Thursday, Mr Hooper relented and said the council would provide temporary toilet facilities. The council relented and installed the loo after locals threatened to collect excrement in the area and take it to local politicians' homes . A spokesman for Bristol City Council said: ‘We have obtained a possession order which we are not able to pursue because of an injunction obtained to prevent the order being enforced. ‘We are unable to comment further as the matter is currently before the court for resolution.’ The authority will return to the high court in six weeks’ time in a big to once again get the family’s injunction removed. The O’Brien family said they had offered all along to pay for the toilet, but the council had refused - and then insisted they have it for free. They said they are currently on the waiting list for a place at the council’s permanent caravan site in nearby Ashton. Parminder Sanghera, a legal representative for the O’Briens, said: ‘The O’Brien family do not want to discuss their ongoing case. ‘I am not authorised to discuss any aspect of the case.’","Portaloos installed after council's bid to remove them was beaten by an injunction .

"By . Luke Salkeld . Melanie Brown, who killed herself after having relationship with two of her bosses - one male and one female, an inquest was told . A charity worker who hanged herself after her lesbian ex-lover began a romance with her best friend left notes in which she said she wished she could ‘sleep for ever’. Melanie Brown, 27, felt she ‘would be better off dead’ after a series of failed relationships and what she saw as betrayal by her former lover – who was also her boss – and the friend, an inquest heard yesterday. And a doctor said she would carry a rope around with her, which showed she had suicidal tendencies. Miss Brown, who had a history of depression, had a six-month relationship with Kim Hamilton, 53, the £120,000-a-year chief executive of the Blue Cross animal charity. The inquest heard that Miss Brown ended the romance thinking it was for her boss’s benefit, only to see Miss Hamilton – who has since left Blue Cross – switch her allegiance to one of her best friends. Bisexual Miss Brown, an admin assistant, then started dating Mike Crossley, 52, the head of fund-raising for the charity, based in Burford, Oxfordshire. But he was then dismissed from his £80,000-a-year job. There were reports that Miss Hamilton, a former City trader, had sacked him with a gagging clause and a £60,000 pay-off. Eight months later, in August last year, Miss Brown hanged herself in the bathroom of her shared flat in Cirencester, Gloucestershire. In notes found on her computer said she would be better off dead so she could no longer ‘hurt anyone’. The inquest heard that her laptop had been accessed nine days after her death and the internet history deleted, but a computer analyst was unable to say if files and emails had also been removed. The inquest heard how bisexual Miss Brown had a six-month relationship with Kim Hamilton, left, before ending it for her boss's benefit. She then had relations with Mike Crossley, right . Gloucester coroner David Dooley, who . recorded a verdict of suicide, said: ‘A lengthy note was found on her . laptop where she spoke about her mental health and her frustration . things were not going anywhere. ‘She . said she was still in the same job and spoke about colleagues. She says . she “still wakes up wishing I was dead”. She speaks of a relationship . of six months or more with another lady but she felt she was hurting the . other lady and terminated the relationship. ‘The . other lady then set up with Melanie’s best friend which caused her more . consternation even though it had been Melanie who had terminated the . relationship earlier. ‘She . then refers to another relationship where it appears to be with a man. She finishes with, “I wish I could sleep for ever because that is the . only time I can forget. Forget about my life, forget about crying and . forget about how fat I am and forget about killing myself”.’ The charity's CEO Miss Hamilton then allegedly fired Mr Crossley after learning about his relationship with Miss Brown. The admin assistant, 27, had a history of depression and was seeing a psychiatrist, the inquest was told . In one, undated, note she wrote: ‘I . hurt everyone I get close to ... I’m wondering if it may be better if . I’m somewhere where I can’t hurt anyone any more.’ Another, . dated July 8, 2013, and believed to be the last note before her death . on August 5, said: ‘Today I thought about hanging myself, just a few . passing thoughts, nothing like I used to but it seems to me that I get . that feeling again when I take too much emotion, like the thought of . hurting someone would be too much so it is better if I stopped it.’ The . inquest heard that in 2012 Miss Brown had struggled with the breakdown . of an earlier same-sex relationship lasting seven-and-a-half years. She . was diagnosed with a mixed personality disorder and attended regular . check-ups and appointments. Doctors noted that she experienced . ‘increased intensity of suicidal thoughts’ and was self-harming. Summarising . her medical care, psychiatrist Dr Svetlin Vrabtchev said: ‘She would . carry a rope around with her showing suicidal tendencies. An important . aspect was relationships with others. She found how to manage . relationships particularly difficult, especially how to manage . boundaries. Blue Cross is a charity which provides support for pet owners who cannot afford private veterinary treatment, helps to find homes for unwanted animals, and educates the public in the responsibilities of animal ownership . ‘She was . struggling with her identity due to early experiences which left her . believing all people were dangerous and must be loved and pleased in . order for her to be liked.’ Recording . a verdict of suicide, the coroner said: ‘Melanie Brown was a very . troubled lady at the time of her death.’ He said her relationships with . her colleagues were ‘not matters to judge upon in a coroner’s court, but . her feelings and state of mind afterwards is important’. Her . history of depression and suicidal tendencies would have contributed to . her feelings of vulnerability brought on by her ‘loneliness and . isolation’, he said. Forensic computer analyst Stephen Lewer said the internet history had been deleted but he was unable to say if files and emails had also been removed.","Melanie Brown had relationship with female boss Kim Hamilton .

"By . Laura Cox . She has clearly not left her days as a ballerina behind her. And as she limbers up, 88-year-old Dame Gillian Lynne displays the same level of agility she had when she was in her 20s. And despite having two metal hips and a foot that is held together by nails, the former West End star is releasing a workout DVD of the exercises, so that other ‘oldies’, as she likes to refer to herself, can keep fit. Scroll down for video . Dame Gillian Lynne has made the DVD espite having two metal hips and a foot held together by nails . Dame Gillian said the market is geared towards the young but that women of any age can complete her routine . Today, Dame Gillian launches Longevity Through Exercise, which guides viewers through a series of exercises and she is believed to be the oldest person to do so. Inspired by her lengthy career as a dancer, choreographer and director, including on the hit musical Cats, Dame Gillian has created the exercises to help older women improve their suppleness and wellbeing. And she made it with her husband Peter Land, 60, because she realised there was nothing on the market for older women. She said: ‘I hate these video tapes for fitness because they’re always with girls with this hanging out and that hanging out and they’re shouting “one, two, three four” and it’s just, that’s not a way to get an oldie going. The whole point of this is for oldies, I haven’t made it for young ones, but for oldies it’s very, very useful’ From curved-back squats which release the spine, to touching your knee with your nose, the former West End star said the exercises are achievable for women of any age. And they are best done before breakfast, Dame Gillian said, to get the blood flowing around the body. As well as her morning work out routine, Dame Gillian sticks to a strict died to stay healthy and in shape . The routine is inspired by Dame Gillian's career as a dancer, choreographer and director . Every morning, Dame Gillian exercises for 40 minutes before doing anything else with her day . First . you loosen up the spine and the side. You do that by standing and . releasing your back. You stand with your feet hip width apart, bum in . and you start to lower. Then . you release the back and when you get all the way down to the floor you . straighten the legs. And then you come up, bone by bone by bone. When you are back to standing, shrug your shoulders, again and again and again and shake it all out. Next, . tense up all your muscles, think about how everything went wrong . yesterday and you say “it doesn’t matter” and let it all out. Make . a box with your arms, like a picture, and twist round to the left side, . and round to the right side, keeping the hips square. Now you’re ready to get on the floor. Sitting . on the floor bring your feet in together to touch, so your legs are . making a diamond shape and press down gently on the knees. That helps to . open up the crotch muscles. Then . lying down on your back, imagine you’re on a pulley and pull yourself . up and back down again. That’s working all the way along the core. Do . about 8 of them with a curved back and then do it again with a straight . back. Sitting . up, open the legs as wide as they will go and then crawl your hands . along the floor so that your torso gets as close to the floor as . possible. Do the same on each leg, walking your way down to the toes. Then . bend the legs and twist them, so the left is bent in front of you and . the right slightly to your side. Twist the torso and open up the arms . like train signals. Then you bring the right arm to the left knee and . follow it with your whole body, say “good morning knee” and repeat on . the other side. Finally, . taken from yoga, hug the legs close to you and rock backwards and . forwards as hard as you can. That’s a really good one for shaking it all . up. Like any good teacher, of course, Dame Gillian follows the programme rigorously herself. And on any given morning she can be found in her living room, going through a 40-minute routine of stretches and toning exercises with Mr Land – who joins her under duress, she joked. ‘I get up, I do my breathing exercises,’ Dame Gillian said. ‘I get my back going, I get my waist twisting. It’s difficult for me to get on the floor, I’ve got two metal hips and a foot that has got nails to keep it together. So I don’t just fall, I go slowly, but even then it’s very ungainly, with my hip, it looks terrible. But I thought no, we have to leave it [in the DVD], because if oldies see it, they’ve probably got something that’s gone. Then there’s a lot of floor work, inspired by Cats. And it’s all been woven in with the jazz work I do and the classical.’ As well as her exercises, Dame Gillian follows a strict diet, which is a throw-back to her days on the stage.She starts her mornings with a glass of hot lime – lemon is too acidic for her dancer’s joints – and after her work out she eats a breakfast of crushed kiwi, gluten-free oats, cinnamon and cayenne pepper, all topped with some water and baked in the oven. Lunch and dinner will be a baked potato and salad or veal escalope with green vegetables – she follows the Hay Diet and never mixes carbohydrates and protein. And she never eats fruit after 6pm, while sugar is strictly prohibited. It is a regime she has followed for most of her adult life, making small changes along the way as she has aged. In fact the only time she relented from it was last year when she suffered a particularly severe bout of pneumonia, which saw her physically unable to exercise and at one point coming close to death. Around the same time she appeared in a documentary about older women, in which she performed some of the exercises she follows. And after being inundated by letters from viewers wanting to know more about her routine, Dame Gillian decided to make the DVD. She said: ‘What it led to was all the ancient people looking at me, because I do some exercises that are perfectly normal to me, wake up work out, which I have to do every day of my life otherwise I wouldn’t be able to do my job. I need to keep fit, limber. And it led to a whole spate of letters from older people saying “isn’t there something for us? This is what we want, we don’t want all that other stuff”.’ ‘Although it’s quite obvious that I am not young, I don’t look as old as I am either,’ added the Dame, who became known as the ‘wartime ballerina’ after beginning her career aged 17. ‘This body has been dancing since it was eight years old, without a stop.’","Dame Gillian Lynne has released DVD Longevity Through Exercise .

"By . William Turvill . The Danish zoo that sparked international outrage after killing an 18-month-old giraffe and then dissecting it in public has drawn further criticism after euthanised four lions. Copenhagen Zoo has said that two lions and their two cubs had to be put down to make way for a new male. But the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has condemned the 'callous' action of the zoo, which, it said, brought the lions into the world only to 'bump them off'. Scroll down for video . The Danish zoo which sparked international outrage after killing an 18-month-old giraffe, dissecting it and feeding it to lions (pictured) has euthanised four lions . Marius (left), a healthy 18-month-old giraffe, was killed with a bolt gun and dissected in front of a crowd . And now the zoo has said it ‘had to euthanise’ the two lions and their cubs - ‘who were not old enough to fend for themselves’. According to The Guardian, the new male lion would have killed the ten-month-old cubs ‘as soon as he got the chance’. After the zoo was unable to find a new home for the lions, all related, they were put down yesterday. The zoo said the animals, unlike Marius, had not been killed and dissected in front of an audience. A PETA spokesman said: 'Copenhagen Zoo, which pleads that there is nowhere to put these animals, didn't find them abandoned on the doorstep one morning – the zoo brought them into this world. ‘Like domesticated cats, big cats breed, unless you make sure that they are sterilised, and that is exactly what the zoo had an ethical obligation to do, rather than bringing cubs into the world simply to bump them off. ‘This callous action highlights the fact that zoo breeding programmes serve no conservation purpose, because animals born in zoos are rarely, if ever, returned to their natural homelands. ‘Instead, zoos spend millions on keeping animals on display like living museum exhibits and dispose of them when they become inconvenient or there are ""too many"" of one kind.’ Marius was killed in February this year despite more than 20,000 people signing an online petition to save him . The zoo said the lions, unlike Marius, had not been killed and dissected in front of an audience . It comes just over a month after Marius, . a healthy young giraffe, was killed with a bolt gun before children . were allowed to watch on as its body was cut up and fed to lions. Marius was killed in February despite more than 20,000 people signing an online petition to save him. Young children stood at arm’s length as his carcass was skinned and dissected before the meat was thrown to the lions. The zoo said the move was necessary to combat inbreeding and said the display was educational. But animal rights campaigners condemned the killing of Marius, saying it exposed the cruel reality of welfare even in Europe’s top zoos. Marius’s plight had triggered worldwide outpourings of protest, including an offer to rehome him in Britain, with many saying they were sickened by a zoo killing a healthy animal. Copenhagen Zoo said it was told by the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA) that Marius was genetically too similar to the other giraffes in its breeding programme. Marius was killed in February this year despite more than 20,000 people signing an online petition to save him . Around a week after Marius was killed, the country passed a law banning the religious slaughter of animals for halal and kosher meat. The law change drew criticism not only from those describing it as 'anti-Semitic' and 'a clear interference in religious freedom', but also from those who pointed to the seemingly hypocritical slaughter of Marius. The Scandinavian country passed the law after years of campaigning.","Copenhagen Zoo has said two lions and their two cubs had to be put down .

"By . Luke Salkeld . In a single day at the height of the Battle of Britain he shot down three German fighters – one before breakfast, one after breakfast and one in the evening. Air Commodore Ronald Berry became one of the RAF’s greatest aces of the Second World War, helping to destroy some 30 enemy aircraft. Indeed, he was held in such esteem that he was one of the few airmen chosen to lead Winston Churchill’s coffin at his funeral in 1965. Now the medals of this remarkable pilot are expected to fetch a six-figure sum at auction, not least because Air Commodore ‘Ras’ Berry as he was nicknamed was one of The Few who helped save Britain in the battle for the skies in the summer of 1940. Ace: Air Commodore Ronald Berry, pictured during the Second World War, once downed three planes in a day .

He . was involved in one of the first dogfights of the war in December 1939 . and also fought the Luftwaffe over France and North Africa. In all, he notched up an impressive tally of up to 30 ‘claims’ on enemy aircraft, including 14 confirmed ‘kills’.

Berry, who sported a handlebar moustache, was born in Hull in 1917. Two . months after the outbreak of war he was sent to Montrose in Scotland to . help protect the airfield there and served in 603 Squadron. Days later . he was involved in one of the earliest interceptions of the war when he . damaged a Heinkel 111 bomber. Due to increasing RAF casualties, 603 . Squadron was sent to Southern England in August 1940 during the height . of the Battle of Britain. Caricature: A later poster which affectionately mocks the star pilot over his achievements .

Onlookers said . they bought bundles, with some walking away with five of the same item. It meant they were then ready to sell on eBay when  Topshop.com began to . sell out. Indeed some shared their plans on Twitter, with one . writing: ‘Kate Moss for Topshop range is very average. Only worth buying . if you want to triple your money by reselling on eBay.’ Reacting . to the eBay surge, the spokesman added: ‘I could give you a personal . reaction, but I don’t think  it would be printable. There is no official . comment.’ It's been the most highly anticipated collaboration of the year and today saw Kate Moss' collection for Topshop finally land. After a four-year hiatus, the supermodel's hotly anticipated range of . festival-inspired clothing went on sale at 346 Topshop stores across 41 countries . and dropped online at 9am. So popular are the . model's Seventies-style pieces, including fringed . suede jackets, jump suits and maxi dresses, that a lot of the pieces . sold out in a matter of minutes - and are already cropping up on eBay . for over three times as much. Fashion fans are clearly keen to snap up the range ahead of festival season; a £75 embroidered smock dress is already out of stock in all sizes, as is a £130 cocktail dress, on Topshop.com. Net-a-porter.com is also selling some of the more pricey garments, and even they've sold out. A £120 paisley print silk coat is long gone, as is her £75 floral dress and the £80 tuxedo trousers she wore to the store last night. But do not fear, fashion fans! There are still plenty of silk blouses and graphic print kaftans to go around. Kate is said to have taken . inspiration from her own wardrobe, which, despite her status as a . supermodel, isn't just full of designer labels. She's also a fan of . scouring the rails of second-hand stores. Main attraction: Hundreds of shoppers turned up at the flagship store to grab a glimpse of Kate Moss, wearing a tuxedo suit from her range, obviously, as she unveiled her new range of festival-inspired clothes . Would YOU pay that much for a Mossy design? One blue jacket is already on sale on eBay for £750, over three times the original price of £120 . A . weave waistcoat, suede shorts and a deep blue fringed jacket are all in . keeping with the Seventies vibe. The latter is said to be inspired by a . jacket the 40-year-old has worn to three Rolling Stones concerts which . she refers to as her 'gig . jacket'. As well as . channelling a vintage look, she was also keen to reflect her laid-back . style. There are baggy pyjama trousers glammed up through the use satin . material in distinct prints and cool kaftans perfect for hitting the . beach in over the summer. For evening wear, there are sexy frilled flapper style dresses and long numbers that flash a hint of thigh. Many of the dresses are also in keeping with the vintage-feel with fringing, sequins and  crepe satin. Seventies chic: Kate models a fringed suede jacket, left, and a sparkly disco fringed dress from her new collection for Topshop . Vintage vibe: The collection includes maxi dresses for evening and day wear with many items inspired by Kate's own wardrobe . Festival attire: Print kaftans and blouses are a wardrobe staple for jetsetter Kate, while a girl can't have enough LBDs . Party dresses: The spring/summer collection also includes day wear and tailored pieces - as well as a fun fringed festival dresses . Meanwhile there are also some tailored pieces for smart office wear including tuxes and trouser suits and summery floral printed shirts. While much of the collection will be sold at affordable prices, one dress is a more pricey £600. The high price tag is to reflect the handiwork that went into creating the densely hand-beaded dress. Kate first collaborated with Topshop in 2007 before taking a break to work on other projects. Last . night, the range was unveiled at the flagship store, causing Oxford . Street to practically shut down as fashion fans waited impatiently for a . first look at the new range. The crowding was exacerbated by the tube . strike: bewildered commuters braving the reduced service were trying to . pile into an overcrowded Oxford Street station at the same time as the model's fans were gathering. They must have got up early! Fashion fans raced to net-a-porter to snap up the range, with many pieces already sold out . The supermodel finally appeared at around 6.20, at which point thousands were waiting impatiently, camera phones poised. Kate sauntered onto the stage erected . outside the main store entrance, wearing a sparkling black blazer and . matching trousers, from her own collection, naturally. The model, although certainly used to huge amounts of attention, appeared almost overwhelmed by the magnitude of the crowd. Kate joined Radio One DJ Nick Grimshaw on stage - however, the only thing she said once the Radio 1 DJ introduced her was: 'Happy shopping'. Oh well. She . disappeared after her brief appearance to go for a private dinner with . friends and supporters - including Cara Delevingne and Sienna Miller - . who were browsing the rails inside the store. Selected friends, family and supporters had been invited . inside for a special VIP preview. Guests included Mary McCartney, sister of designer Stella . McCartney, Linda Shepherd - Kate Moss' mother - and Sienna Miller. Following . the launch of Kate's latest range for Topshop the online auction site, . eBay has seen a flurry of new bidders keen to get hold of the model's . latest offerings that are quickly selling out online and in store. However, if bidders want to be in with a chance with getting their hands . on the collection their budget may need to be more suited to Selfridges than . Topshop... Metallic jacquard blazer .

"By . Luke Salkeld . The heiress of a £250million family business has quit the company after her plans to turn it into a co-operative were rejected. Caroline Murphy, a director of construction firm Murphy Group, had decided to hand control of the firm set up by her father to its 3,500-strong work force. The plan is said to have upset some of her fellow board members, including her mother and two brothers. She is said to have walked out of the company after fellow executives  baulked at her vision, which is modelled on a Spanish co-operative. Off: Caroline Murphy has turned her back on her £250m construction business in a row over turning it into a workers' co-op . Miss Murphy, who inherited the company which specialises in civil engineering from her late father, John, said the split was amicable. She told a newspaper: ‘In every family, on every board, people come with different views. ‘I’ve said I want it to happen and it’s not happening. It’s not something everyone’s agreed to.’ Miss Murphy, 31, has committed to selling her 20 per cent stake in the firm – worth up to £40million – to staff for peppercorn sums. Murphy Group is a big player in the construction industry and is currently digging tunnels for the Crossrail project . She believes the co-op experiment is a form of direct democracy under which employees vote on key decisions. Long-serving workers get more shares, while those on low wages pay little for the stock. Miss Murphy was inspired to adopt the model after a visit to a company called Mondragon, a Spanish workers’ co-op that operates grocery shops, car factories and local banks. ‘On the day we visited, their supermarket workers had just taken a decision – this was people stacking shelves, working on the tills – to work longer hours for no pay increase. ‘That was what they voted for because they understood the competition, the environment their chain was operating in and they could see that was the right decision.’ She says it is a myth that workers with power will always award themselves a pay increase. Another reason for her philosophy is empowering ‘voiceless’ people, she said. Miss Murphy is a union activist, gay rights advocate and a campaigner against sexual violence.She has in the past written on her blog about her experience of being raped – and the suicide attempts which followed. ‘I get flashbacks,’ she said. ‘One of the symptoms of post-traumatic stress for me was over-activity, over-working. I wanted to work 16 hours a day to keep myself occupied.’ After recovering from a nervous breakdown in 2009, Miss Murphy started work on an MA in violence against women and children. She also plans to marry her long-term partner later this year. Murphy is a big player in the construction industry and is currently working on the Crossrail project . Her father set up Murphy Group in 1945 to clear bomb sites left by the Blitz. It is a big player in the construction industry and is currently working on the Crossrail project. Miss Murphy said her father, who died in 2009 aged 95, would have approved of her plans. ‘The natural extension of my father’s values, in my view, is the development of the Murphy Group into an employee-owned structure,’ she said. ‘My dad’s view was that you can only wear one pair of shoes at a time.’ She added: ‘People have always had their say within the business but that was very much in the gift of my father, or in my gift. I wanted it not to be in anybody’s gift.’","Caroline Murphy wanted to give building site workers power to make key decisions .

"By . Paul Donnelley . and Sam Creighton . An album of messages kept by a nurse during the First World War and written in by the soldiers she saved, is to be sold at auction. The book, once belonging to Red Cross nurse Hilda Stephen Thomas, also contains photographs and drawings and has been unearthed in Derbyshire. The earliest entry dates back to 1907 and tells the story of Hilda, from Glamorgan, South Wales, who cared for soldiers at a hospital in the Mumbles area of Swansea. The book is full of messages from soldiers Hilda treated during the war . Private Parry's message: 'Flowers may wither, leaves may die, friends may forget you, but never will I' The album also contains sketches and paintings, presumably also done by wounded soldiers . The album contains touching messages, such as one from Private J. Parry 2555, of the Monmouthshire Regiment, who wrote in 1916: 'To my sisters at the Red Cross Hospital Mumbles... Flowers may wither, leaves may die, friends may forget you, but never will I.' Another . entry, dated June 24, 1915, was . written by Bandsman S Farrell of the 2nd Leinster Regiment. It reads: 'When the war is all over and peace is proclaimed, the cannons have long . ceased their grumbles, we will shout hip aray and long for the day to . return once again to old Mumbles. 'So . now boys, I ask you to join in  with me in praise of the sisters we . mention. May god from above protect them with love for we may want again . there attention.' Photographs of wounded soldiers and of a funeral, included in the album . One of the sketches in the album that is to be sold at auction on Monday . The touching messages have been unearthed after many years . Another drawing, dating December 7, 1914 . A third, from 1915, reads: 'Come all my brave old Comrades, . attention pay to me, if by chance you do get wounded and sent across the . sea, come straight away to mumbles and there you'll have some gaff. Your wounds will soon be mended by the good old Red Cross Staff' The album . also contains a pen and ink drawings and photographs, showing two . recovering soldiers playing chess, with a nurse- who may be Hilda- . watching on. The book was found by Charles Hanson, manager of Hansons Auctioneers in Etwall, Derbyshire. He said: 'The album is a remarkable archive of content. 'I . hope the album, for its poignancy of content, will appeal to an . institution where it can be placed on permanent display. It may even . appeal to a medic.' Hilda's . album will be entered in to Hansons military auction titled 'A . Century On' which will take place on Monday April 28 and is expected to fetch up to £200. The flute will be played by Andrew Fairley, who bought it in a junk shop in 1963 . A flute thought to have been carved during the Great War is to be played for the first time in more than 50 years tomorrow. Andrew Fairley bought the instrument, which is made from a cardboard tube, printed Wills tobacco paper and bullet casings, at a junk shop in 1963 in Brentford, Middlesex, paying he thinks five shillings. Retired professional flautist Mr Fairley, 74, is playing polka and waltz pieces on it as a solo at a charity concert in Woodbridge, Suffolk. He said: ‘It is amazing that it has survived this long and I thought the time was right to play it to mark the 100th anniversary of the start of the war. ‘It is fairly basic and quirky, but I have learned to temper it and use some odd fingering to get round some suspect notes.’ The divorced father-of-two recently the sent 11in-long flute, which he keeps in a drawer at his home in Felixstowe, Suffolk, to be examined by officials at the Imperial War Museum who wrote back to say it was highly likely to have been made in the trenches. Mr Fairley added: ‘They said it was totally unique and they had never seen anything like it before - but all the materials it was built from came from the war period. ‘The tone hole, or embouchure hole, is a bullet casing cut down and the blow hole is also made from brass bullet casing. ‘Holding that part together is rifle pull through cord. They had to make do with simple stuff, anything that was available in the trenches. Mr Fairley said the flute had been waxed, possibly with boot polish, to hold it together and make it waterproof. He added: ‘I have got no idea who made it. I guess it landed up in the junk shop after a house clearance. I just bought it as a curiosity.’ The instrument is to be played at a concert given by the 30-piece Community String Orchestra which Mr Fairley conducts.","The album contains pages of messages, photographs and sketches .

"By . Laura Cox . She admitted wearing Spanx beneath her dresses after developing a ‘paunch’ she couldn’t work off. Amanda Holden has said that she has swapped spanks for yoga . But now Amanda Holden has stopped using the popular shape wear, because she has found that yoga works just as well. Yesterday, the Britain’s Got Talent judge, 43, said embarking on a new fitness regime had helped tone her figure, rendering the tight-fitting underwear unnecessary. Making her comments in a Radio Times interview she also admitted the talent show had restricted her acting career, while dismissing its rival The X Factor as ‘boring’. And she revealed Jimmy Savile once offered to give her a ‘gynaecological problem’ – ‘completely out of order but I wasn’t traumatised’, while a comedian left her feeling ‘cheap and worthless’ when he ‘groped’ her. Throwing away the Spanx marks an apparent boost in Miss Holden’s body confidence, for it is usually used by women who wish to hide certain parts of themselves. Even slender stars are known to wear the tight-fitting pants, including Emma Watson whose Spanx could be seen beneath the thigh-split gown she wore to a premiere last week. But revealing her decision to put hers in the bin, Miss Holden said: ‘I used to be a big fan of Spanx but ditched them two years ago when I started yoga, which has changed my shape.’ Adding of the teenage body hang-ups that she has finally managed to shake off, Miss Holden, who is now mother to her two daughters, Lexie, eight, and Hollie, two, said: ‘My best friend at school, Vic, had massive boobs and I wished I did. ‘I used to put everything down there – cotton wool, my dad’s socks, the kitchen sink – but now I’m 43 I’m happy because they’re still in the same position, more or less.’ Miss Holden’s comments come as the eighth series of Britain’s Got Talent approaches. Next Saturday will see the start of the talent contest, with Miss Holden joining Simon Cowell, David Walliams and Alesha Dixon forming the judging panel. She is the only judge – aside from creator Simon Cowell – to have remained on the panel for all of its eight series. But she admitted feeling stinted by the programme, because it restricts what she is offered as an actress. ‘In this country it seems you can only do one thing at a time,’ the former Wild at Heart star said. ‘I started in comedy with Simon Pegg and when I auditioned for drama they said, “She only does comedy”, and then I got drama and was never considered for comedy. Scroll down for video . Spanks no more: The next series of Britain's Got Talent will begin on Saturday. Amanda Holden is the only judge, aside from creator Simon Cowell, to have remained on the panel for all of its eight series . ‘And because of BGT I’m now a presenter, which I love, but I’m considered too well known to act.’Worse than Britain’s Got Talent, however, would be to appear on rival talent contest The X Factor. And Miss Holden said: ‘It’s a far better programme than The X Factor because we have more variety. It must be hard to judge singer after singer. But I don’t want to be told off by Simon for saying it’s boring. I’m a realist, though.’ For now, though, Miss Holden said she is happy to be a part of Britain’s Got Talent, because it means she can spend time with her daughters, and her second husband Chris Hughes, whom she married after divorcing Les Dennis. ‘If I was in America, I’d have my own show on the back of BGT because I’m bums on seats,’ she said. ‘It’s weird but works for me because I have my girls and if I did a drama I’d be away from home for 16 hours a day.’ Throwing away the Spanx marks an apparent boost in Miss Holden¿s body confidence, for it is usually used by women who wish to hide certain parts of themselves .","Ditched figure-flattering underwear two years ago when took up the sport .

Reverend Simon Treloar, 53, grabbed attacker Jason Haynes, 32, by the throat after the criminal, who had been released from prison just that day, tried to force his way in. Reverend Treloar said: 'I might be a clergyman but I am not a doormat. I did what I had to do - but,of course, I forgive him. Reverend Simon Treloar grabbed his attacker by the throat and forced him out of his doorway . 'People think Christianity is a soft touch but that's what the benefits agency is for.' The Dean of St Mary's Roman Catholic Cathedral in Wrexham, North Wales, kept Haynes at arms length and forced him out of his house before calling the police.

Tony Webber, 25, says he can't face getting back on his bike after the accident on Tuesday, which ended with him lying in a pool of his own blood on Stoughton Road in Guilford, Surrey. He was flipped over his handlebars and was knocked unconscious as he collided with the road. He hit his head with such force his teeth were forced through his lip. He was not wearing a helmet but claims doctors told him it would not have prevented his injuries. Shocking injuries: Tony Webber is now claiming compensation from Surrey County Council after he fell from his bike when it hit a pothole . Luckily for Mr Webber, a GP was also cycling by and called the emergency services. Mr Webber, a hospitality worker at the University of Surrey, said: 'I was cycling back from my friend's house and down a road which I go down everyday and that's the last thing I remember. 'The next thing I knew I woke in hospital several hours later and I was in a lot of pain. My mum took a picture of me and I couldn't believe the state of my face. 'Apparently I was lying on the road in a pool of blood. A passerby, who luckily happened to be a GP, found me and called the ambulance and police.'I cycle down that road every day Monday to Friday.

He said: 'I've been cycling since I was four and have never had any accidents before now. But this incident has really put me off and I don't think I'll be getting on a bike any time soon.' He said he is shocked by the treatment he has received from Surrey County Council when he reported the accident. 'I called up the council and they didn't seem bothered by it so I've contacted a claims company,' he said. 'A pothole has a very different impact on a bike and it completely took me out. It was pretty disgraceful.' A spokesman for Surrey County Council said: 'We are unable to comment on this accident as we have not yet had a report from Surrey Police. 'However, in the seven previous years there were eight recorded injury accidents on Stoughton Road, most of which occurred at the mini-roundabout and none of which were attributed to potholes. 'We regularly inspect roads and repair potholes as quickly as possible according to the risk they present, and encourage the public to report them via our website or contact centre. 'Anyone can submit a claim for compensation, and we assess each one on its merits. As claims are paid from council funds we have a duty to our taxpayers only to pay out when we are clearly in breach of our responsibilities or our duty of care to our residents.'","WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"By . Sarah Dean . and Australian Associated Press . It takes an average of 22 years for survivors of child abuse to come forward and many Australians who have been abused still haven’t spoken out, the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse says. In its interim report, released on Monday, the commission said on average female victims were nine years old and male victims 10 years old when the abuse started and that it takes men longer than women to disclose their abuse. The commission, which began its inquiry into institutional abuse on 13 January 2013, said its analysis also showed 90 per cent of sex abusers are men. 'We understand that although many people have come forward to the Royal Commission, it is likely that they represent only a minority of those abused,’  the commission said. The Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse has revealed its interim report. This pictures shows Commissioner Justice Peter McClellan in Sydney . 'Many others are yet to disclose their abuse or, for various reasons, feel unable to come forward at this time.’ On Monday, the commission which has already been running for 18 months, urged the federal government to give it more time and money to finish its job or risk squandering the opportunity and insulting the victims. The commission said it needs another $104 million and an extra two years to do its job and reach more vulnerable groups. Truth Justice and Healing Council chief executive Francis Sullivan says the inquiry into institutional responses to child sex abuse must be given the time and resources it wants. 'To not finish the job properly and completely would be an insult to all the victims of abuse and one of the greatest lost opportunities of our generation,’ he said in a statement. Brother Julian McDonald Deputy Province Leader of Christian Brothers of Ociania (right) with Frances Sullivan (left) from the Truth and Justice Healing Council. Sullivan says the inquiry into institutional responses to child sex abuse must be given the time and resources it wants . 'This is a once in a lifetime chance for the community to fully understand the devastation of child sexual abuse, its historic pervasion into so many different institutions and steps needed to ensure past tragedies are never revisited.’ YMCA . SALVATION ARMY . CHRISTIAN BROTHERS . Attorney-General George Brandis said the interim report made clear the enormous scale of the task being undertaken by the commission. 'It is important that those affected by child sexual abuse and the Australian community as a whole can learn from the commission's work so far,’ he said in a brief statement. The federal government was considering the request for a two year extension of the royal commission's December 31, 2015 closing date to deliver its final report, it said. The commission’s investigation into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse has many different parts to it. Firstly, it is running a series of research projects into child sex abuse, including a history of abuse offences in Australia and analysis to identify possible sentencing reform for child abusers. It is also planning a review of the strengths and challenges of mandatory reporting requirements in Australia. Another project currently in the scoping phase is a review of evidence to explain the relevance of child pornography and child exploitation material to child sexual abuse in institutions. In its two volume interim report, 14 case studies investigated by the commission over the past 18 months are covered. The report includes the personal stories of 150 people who shared their experience of abuse by coming to a private session or providing a written account. The commission has held hearings across Australia into how religious, educational and youth institutions responded to allegations of abuse, in some cases dating back decades. The report says by the end of 2015 the Royal Commission will have conducted up to 4,000 private sessions but unless it is extended for two additional years it will not be able to hold a private session for anyone who contacts them after September this year. 'This will deny many survivors of the opportunity to share their experiences with us, in particular those from vulnerable or hard-to-reach groups.’ 'We need another two years to complete the additional 30 hearings we have identified as essential to fulfill the terms of reference.’ The commission said on average female victims were nine years old and male victims 10 years old when the abuse started . In one of the scoping phase projects, school-based child sexual abuse prevention policies and curricula will be audited and compared with overseas models. In another, there will be a review of pre-employment screening practices for child-related work. A large project relates to the history of child sex abuse in Australia, with a review of factors and events linked to understanding of this form of abuse since the arrival from the first fleet. Data from the royal commission's private sessions with abuse victims will be analysed to assess characteristics of both victims and offenders and the impact on victims. Those convicted of institutional child sex abuse will be sentenced, possibly to jail terms. The commission wants to see whether that process can be reformed. Also under examination will be trial processes and how evidence can be given by child sexual abuse complainants for use in court. Attorney-General George Brandis said the interim report made clear the enormous scale of the task being undertaken by the commission . The commission has said children can help design institutions that are safe for them as they have the knowledge and experience different to adults. Research into the views of children about their safety from sexual abuse in institutions has thus been ordered. The commission is yet to reach a view on a national redress scheme for survivors. 'We have not yet reached a view on a national scheme,’ the commission said. Four Australian states have offered redress schemes for former residents of child institutions in Qld, WA, Tas and SA. The schemes have different coverage, eligibility rules, validation procedures and payment options. Incomplete data from the Catholic Church's National Committee for Professional Standards shows Church authorities have paid more than $43 million to claimants since 1997. The Salvation Army is facing a slump in donations to its flagship fundraising drive after the inquiry's revelations of terrible sexual abuse of children in its care . The commission is considering whether it is appropriate in principal to recommend a national scheme, if its possible to devise a scheme that's fair to both claimants and institutions and how that scheme might fit with existing redress schemes. 'The Royal Commission understands the importance of this issue to victims and institutions and will consult widely as our thinking develops,’ the report said. Meanwhile, the Salvation Army is facing a slump in donations to its flagship fundraising drive after the inquiry’s revelations of terrible sexual abuse of children in its care. Donations to the Red Shield Appeal Doorknock in May are down an estimated 20 per cent this year. Spokesman Major Bruce Harmer said the evidence heard at the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse was a key factor. The church expects to fall 20 per cent or $2 million short of its $10 million target for the doorknock held on May 24 and 25. It also expects to miss the $80 million target of the broader Red Shield Appeal, which includes corporate and other donations.

"By . Joel Christie . A Texas mother is demanding her local school district removes a widespread ban on sunscreen, saying her daughter recently got severely burnt during a field trip and that skin cancer runs in her family. The North East Independent School District in San Antonio imposed the restriction because it considers sunscreen toxic and fears students will eat it. The policy applies to 72 schools in the area. But according to parent Christy Riggs, its a rule that is completely unwarranted. Not impressed: Christy Riggs, of San Antonio, says a district policy affecting 72 schools prohibiting sunscreen because it is 'toxic' caused her daughter to get severely burned on a recent field trip . 'The reality is, children don't eat sunscreen and they're not going to,' Riggs told Fox News. School district spokeswoman Aubrey Chancellor told the ABC they are trying to stop unnecessary allergic reactions. 'We don't want students sharing sunscreen,' she told the station. 'If students get it in their eyes or react badly to the sunscreen it can be quite serious.' The district treats sunscreen as a medicine, Chancellor said, and requires a doctor's note to apply it at school. But Mrs Riggs lost her father to skin cancer this year. She said it was only six weeks between the time he was diagnosed and his death. The ban is harmful to the children, she said. Before school only: The North East Independent School District in San Antonio says if parents want to put sunscreen on their children, they can do it before school . 'We want to teach our children to eat healthier, yet we have them outside and let them burn,' Riggs said. 'I'm not saying all children should be required to bring sunscreen,' Riggs said. 'But skin cancer is on the rise and reapplying at school shouldn't be an issue.' Mrs Chancellor said the district have no qualms with parents applying sunscreen to their children before they go to school. However Mrs Riggs hit back, saying if the students are outside or swimming they need to reapply every few hours.

"By . Hannah Roberts . The iconic Cafe de Paris in Rome - the inspiration behind Federico Fellini's classic La Dolce Vita - has been destroyed in a suspected arson attack. During the heady days of the Dolce Vita in the 1960s, Cafe de Paris was one of the preferred watering holes of the rich and famous with patrons such as Sofia Loren and Frank Sinatra. The blaze at the historic bar on Rome’s Via Veneto is thought to be connected to the eviction of its new management on the morning of the fire. The iconic Cafe de Paris in Rome - the inspiration behind Federico Fellini's classic La Dolce Vita - has been destroyed in a suspected arson attack . Flames broke out in the basement next to a changing room for employees at around 1am on Tuesday. No one was injured. Aldo Berti, manager of the bar since 2009, said: ‘A can of petrol was found next to the start of the fire. 'Not long afterwards we were served with an eviction notice. Now all the staff will lose their jobs.’ Cafe de Paris, one of the places that gave the world the word paparazzi, fell into decline along with the rest of Rome's famed Via Veneto in 2009 when police discovered it was a mafia money-laundering front and confiscated it before it was entrusted to a legal guardian. During the heady days of the Dolce Vita in the 1960s, Cafe de Paris was one of the preferred watering holes of the rich and famous with patrons such as Sofia Loren and Frank Sinatra . During the heady days of the Dolce Vita in the 1960s, Cafe de Paris was one of the preferred watering holes of the rich and famous such as Sofia Loren and Frank Sinatra . The . bar on one of Rome’s most expensive streets had been bought in 2005 for . 250,000 euros in cash in the name of a penniless barber called Damiano . Villari, although at the time it was worth an estimated six million . euros. The famed sidewalk cafe and restaurant had in fact been purchased by the . Cosoleto clan of the 'Ndrangheta organized crime group from southern . Calabria in 2005 and it had been used, along with other bars and . restaurants in Rome and Milan, to launder drug money. Four years ago marked a rebirth when, in association with one of Italy's leading anti-Mafia groups Libera, Cafe de Paris started serving wines, pasta and other foods produced on lands confiscated from the Mafia throughout southern Italy . It is a far cry from Fellini's 1960 classic, which starred the Italian actor Marcello Mastroianni as a society reporter - his kiss with Anita Ekberg in the Trevi Fountain has become one of the most famous scenes in cinema history . Father . Luigi Ciotti, the head of Libera said at the time: 'Everyone should know that the . Cafe de Paris is now free of the mafia presence. An establishment that . once enriched the clans of the 'Ndrangheta has returned to being a legal . business.' 'This . is a concrete sign of a daily fight (against organised crime) that is . gradually bearing fruit. We need people to know that this establishment . is now 'clean'. It's the start of a new chapter.' The . Ndrangheta are the country’s wealthiest and most feared criminal . organisation and are responsible for the import of 80 per cent of . Europe’s cocaine. Much of their earnings are laundered through legitimate businesses. Seven in ten of Rome’s historic centre restaurants pizzerias and cafes are thought to be in the hands of organised crime, according to the municipal. Figures from LUISS University in Rome put the turnover for Mafia groups from their Rome operations at more than one billion euros a year. Fellini's 1960 classic film, which starred the Italian actor Marcello Mastroianni, Anita Ekberg and Anouk Aimee, was considered scandalous at the time of its release but is quite tame by the standards of today. In seven loosely connected episodes, Mastroianni, playing reporter Marcello, covers the escapades of residual nobility, nouveau riche, starlets and hangers-on of the cafe set on the Via Veneto as he struggles to find meaning in his own life. Marcello chronicles events with a photographer whose last name is Paparazzo: the name Fellini gave him is now in dictionaries in nearly every language meaning aggressive street photographers. In its emblematic scene, Sylvia, a towering phosphorescent blonde diva played by Ekberg, lures Marcello into a sensual midnight wade in the cold waters of Rome's Trevi Fountain.","Blaze happened at the historic bar on Rome's Via Veneto on Tuesday .

With a physique that you wouldn't normally associate with a seasoned sportsman, sumo wrestler Manny Yarbrough weighs the same as three Usain Bolts combined. But Manny, who has a staggering 76 inch waist, says he wants to lose weight ahead of his retirement from the sport next year as he fears that his weight will balloon further when he becomes less active. Scroll down for video . Meet 'Tiny': Sumo wrestler Manny Yarbrough is the Guinness World Record holder for the title of 'world's heaviest athlete' - but he is hoping to slim down for retirement . Larger than life: Manny, who has a 76 inch waist, weighs the equivalent of more than three Usain Bolts . Heavy: Manny weighs in at 719lb, or a staggering 51 stone . He fears that gaining any more weight will lead to serious health problems and doesn't want to face the embarassment he suffered when he an airline ticket was cancelled because of his size. Manny has banished convenient takeaways and eats food such as eggs or yoghurt for breakfast before driving to the gym for an intense workout. He says although he has had days where it has felt easier to pack in competing and let his weight get the better of him the sportsman inside won't give up. Manny said: 'I got up to 58 stone at one point. It was when I hit that mark I knew I had to lose some weight it just wasn't right. Aiming to bow out on a high: Manny hopes to retire next year, but not before becoming sumo world champion . In training: Manny now avoids takeaways and is undertaking a strict training regime . 'It got to the point where I was barely able to move around and would go long stretches inside the house because I couldn't do anything else. 'At first I knew I had to shift some weight but I was still able to compete at little. Thinking longer term though I knew it was wrong and had to think more about my health and find other ways to get an edge over my competitors as although the weight helped I wasn't able to move well - I got too big to compete. He added; 'I haven't set a target weight loss as I am worried I might not feel how had expected then I hit that number so I'm just working towards what I feel good at. 'I'd do what everybody else did growing . up but from the age of about six I knew I was bigger than the others and . probably always would be.' Manny Yarbrough . 'I'm desperate to get back to my best college shape in time for the nationals next year - it's the sportsman in me that never give up attitude. 'It's a challenge, I had to give it a shot because of that inner athlete in me pushing me to do it. 'Once I retire it's about a quality of life I want to have. I had a ticket cancelled on me on a flight to Italy a few years ago and haven't flown since through fear it would happen again. 'Nobody wants to go through that kind of embarrassment so it's something which drives me forward. 'I'm desperate to go back to the UK and I've always wanted to go to Spain so I have other ambitions once I finish competing.' Since the age of six Manny always knew he was different to most children and had to remember to hold back while playing with others so he didn't hurt them. Towering: Manny, who is pictured with a sports team at high school, says that his weighted ballooned when he took up sumo wrestling . But now, Guinness World Record holder Manny uses his size to his advantage as he grapples and pummels other giant athletes inside the Sumo ring. By the time he was 12-years-old Manny was already a staggering 5ft11in and 18 stone and by 15 he had shot up to 6ft4in and put on a further five stone. He never puts his size down to eating junk food or being lazy, instead insisting it's a mixture of genetics and an abundance of food during his childhood. Growing up in Rahway in New Jersey, USA, he spent a lot of time with his aunt who prepared super-sized meals for his older cousins. Yet Manny was always active which kept him healthy. He loved playing sport whether it was football, baseball, American football or wrestling before finally becoming hooked on Sumo. It was after picking up Sumo his size ballooned. By the time he was 25 he weighed a whopping 36 stone which steadily crept to more than 43 stone as the rigours of Sumo training took hold. Now the 6ft7in 'World's Heaviest Athlete' title holder has set his sights on winning the US national Sumo title in 2014 before bowing out from competition. He said: 'When I was a child I played every sport I could but I was always the 'big kid' - it was just my luck in life. 'I'd do what everybody else did growing up but from the age of about six I knew I was bigger than the others and probably always would be. 'When we were playing with friends I had to remember to hold back so I didn't hurt anyone. 'It's partly down to genetics as it isn't just weight I have always been tall too. People never used to pay attention to the nutritional value of food and I was growing pretty fast so needed to eat. Always big: Manny, who is pictured at school, says that he became aware that he was bigger than the other kids from the age of six . Slimming down: The sumo wrestler has been heading to the gym every morning after breakfast . He added: 'My aunt would make big breakfasts because my cousins went out to work - but I wasn't accustomed to that I just hung out and ate with them. 'During my late teens college sport kept me in shape because I trained on a consistent basis. I was running five miles daily, jogging stadium steps and ate whatever I wanted but I was always active so didn't affect me until I stopped for any reason. 'My weight increase happened naturally and I used Sumo as an excuse because there was a lot of eating involved to bulk up. 'It never stopped me doing things. I loved competing and getting inside the ring is the greatest feeling - I just enjoy what I do so much.'","Manny Yarbrough weighs three times as much as sprint champion Usain Bolt .

Actors Anton Troy and John Lacy discuss what happened during their performance, which resulted in both of them leaving the production and the show being cancelled . 'I've stood up to bullies my whole life. 'When I hear or see something that's unacceptable — I'm not the kind of person to go up and punch someone in the face — but I will get in your face and, if I need to, put my hands on you to let you know that I don't appreciate what is unacceptable. 'And that's who I am, and I'll never change. 'I'm not a violent person (but) I stand up to homophobes, racists, people who are insulting my wife, anyone who threatens my children.' Lacy said that Troy approached him backstage during intermission of the play on Saturday night in Newhall, California, saying that a member of the audience had been bullying during the first half. Lacy, trying to prepare for his own scenes for act two, told Troy to channel his anger into his performance, according to CBS LA. 'That's all you can do, man - let's get out there and have a great second act,' Lacy recalled telling Troy. 'We have to trust each other that we can pull together and make it work.' But once he stepped out on stage, Lacy got a serving first-hand, hearing some boos. Scene: The confrontation occurred at the Repertory East Playhouse in Old Town Newhall, California, on Saturday night . Then, after a heated scene between the characters of Brick and Big Daddy, played by Troy and Lacy, the heckler in the audience yelled out: 'Because he's a f--.' 'I just said ''What did you say, motherf---er?''' Lacy recalled. 'I went through our stage door, took off my vest, went into the audience - as he stood proudly to stare at me with a stupid grin on his face — (and) I pushed him, and he was drunk, so he easily just collapsed. 'I knew better than to start throwing punches. 'I had made my point. I silenced the heckler, and thankfully, one of the audience members — this enormous 6'5'', 280-lb. filmmaker named Tim Sullivan, who happened to be gay and was not at all happy with what was happening — reached over and picked this guy up by his shirt collar and literally carried him out of the theater.' Sullivan later told the Santa Clarita Valley Signal he 'physically did what everybody else wanted done'. 'It’s nice to see that Tennessee Williams is still causing sparks,' Sullivan added. John Lacy is a veteran actor of 26 years. He has been married for 20 years, but says he won't stand for homophobia . While the show continued from that point, it wasn't all victories. Following the performance, Lacy was fired by the producers. Troy - defending his co-star - decided to quit the show. 'Of course, I could have stopped and said ''Could we have the house lights on, please? I'd like this gentleman removed'',' Lacy told Playbill. 'But when you call my fellow actor a 'f--' in front of (the audience0, it's not f---ing acceptable.' A press release from the theater that was posted to their website said the show had been cancelled because of an 'incident' that occurred during the May 31 performance.","Incident occurred Saturday night at the Repertory East Playhouse production of Cat On A Hot Tin Roof in Newhall, California .

"By . Hannah Roberts . Pope Francis has confessed that he fell in love with a girl that he met when he was training to be a priest. After a week-long fixation, the Latin pontiff then aged 22 or 23 had to seek redemption in the confession booth, he revealed. In an extraordinary interview to celebrate his first year in the Catholic church’s top job, Francis revealed that ‘there was a girl that turned my head for a week when I was at the seminary.’ Holy secret: Pope Francis, pictured in the Vatican today, has revealed that he had to seek redemption in the confession booth, after falling in love with a woman when he was at the seminary in his early 20s . He said: ‘But we were young.’ He added mischievously: ‘I tell my confessor about these things.’ The Argentinian pontiff seems to have had no problem attracting the ladies in his youth. Pope Francis has said he is finding the growing ‘Superpope’ hype that surrounds him offensive. In an interview published to mark his first anniversary as pontiff, he said that he dislikes the media painting a picture of him as a celebrity and a star. However, in stark contrast, the Vatican is marking the anniversary of his election with commemorative stamps and coins and a DVD with never-before-seen footage of the pope. Francis told Italian daily Corriere della: ‘Depicting the pope as a sort of Superman, a star, is offensive to me. ‘The pope is a man who laughs, cries, sleeps calmly and has friends like everyone else. A normal person.’ He has previously revealed that he had a girlfriend when he was 17, that he used to go dancing with in salsa clubs. However his vocation to the priesthood was too strong. On a night out with friends in Buenos Aires, the youngster stopped to go to confession when his decision to join the priesthood came upon him. And after he became pope, a long lost childhood love came forward. Former neighbour Amalia Damonte told how their families had divided them after the then Jorge Maria Bergoglio had sworn to marry her, aged 12. In the anniversary interview, Francis also revealed that former Pope Benedict XVI was to come out of retirement. Loved: Pope Francis waves at the crowd upon his arrival at St.Peter's square for the weekly general audience on Wednesday . The papa: Pope Francis joked with the crowd and even put on a military Alpine hat as the interview about his week-long love story was published . Big wave: The interview, done in the anniversary of his ascent to Pope, also saw him reveal that his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI will come out of retirement . After becoming the first Pope in 600 . years to resign a year ago, Benedict was forced to commit to a . cloistered life, remaining ‘hidden from the world’. In the interview, Pope Francis defended the Catholic Church’s record on child abuse saying that it had done much since the scandal first broke some 15 years ago and was being singled out for attack. He defended the Church and his predecessor former Pope Benedict, whom Francis credited with having the courage to start reforms. ‘On this path, the Church has done much, perhaps more than all others,’ he said. ‘The Catholic Church is perhaps the only public institution that has moved with transparency and responsibility. 'No-one has done more, and yet the Church is the only one that is being attacked,’ he said. He appeared to be referring to a report by a United Nations committee last month which accused the Vatican of systematically turning a blind eye to decades of sexual abuse of children by priests, and demanded it turn over known or suspected offenders to civil justice. A ‘shadow Pope’ lurking would become a rallying point for opposition to Francis and risk splitting the Catholic Church, many in the Curia or Vatican civil service feared. But Francis said that his predecessor still had a lot to offer, and was like ‘a granddad who didn’t deserve to be put in an old people’s home.’ ‘We discussed it and decided together that it’s best that he sees people and goes out and rejoins church life’, he told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera. ‘Some wanted him to retire to a Benedictine monastery far from the Vatican. 'But it made me think of granddads who strengthen the family with their knowledge and advice and don’t deserve to be put in an old people’s home.’ Francis appeared to pave the way for his own eventual retirement saying that although Benedict was the first, Pope Emeritus, or retired Pope, the position would become routine. ‘It should be an institution, he said. ‘He [Benedict] is the first and perhaps there will be others’, he hinted.","Pope had a one-week obsession with a woman in his early 20s .

"By . Sara Malm . Sordid: Sarah Symonds, 44, has revealed that Max Clifford arranged to have sex with her in the disabled toilet in his Mayfair office . A former ‘professional mistress’ famous for an alleged affair with celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay, has today revealed she slept with convicted sex offender Max Clifford in a toilet specially adapted for his disabled daughter. Sarah Symonds, 44, says that she was led to the disabled cubicle by Clifford at his PR company's Mayfair office after a business meeting. Writing in her column for a Welsh newspaper, Ms Symonds says Clifford boasted about cheating on his wife and showed her explicit pictures of his mistress. Clifford, 71, was jailed for eight years on Friday for eight years after being convicted of a string of sex offences. A jury at Southwark Crown Court found him guilty of eight indecent assaults, which took place on four victims aged 15 to 19 between the years of 1978 and 1984. The court heard how Max thought he was 'untouchable' because of his celebrity links, which allowed him to intimidate his victims into staying silent for more than 30 years. It was heard that after assaulting the women he would warn that nobody would believe them if they spoke out. Ms Symonds, of Newport, Gwent, reveals in her Wales on Sunday newspaper column that she had sex with Clifford in the office toilet specially adapted for his daughter Louise, 42, who suffers from autoimmune disease rheumatoid arthritis. She said: ‘The thing that would shock - and sicken - me the most, was when I found out Max Clifford's casting couch would turn out to be his daughter's specially adapted disabled toilet cubicle. ‘That is something I can't ever forget.’ Ms Symonds was visiting Max Clifford Associates’s New Bond Street office to discuss PR work for her and a dating site. She wrote: ‘As soon as I sat down in the leather chair in Clifford's office, he blurted out: ""I was an adulterer all through my marriage. I've had tons of affairs."" ‘He then opened the top left hand drawer of his desk and pulled out a picture of a woman in a very compromising position.' Habit: Max Clifford told Ms Symonds to meet him in the toilet specially adapted for his disabled daughter Louise, pictured with Clifford after he was found guilty of eight counts of indecent assault, as if he had 'given the instructions before' ‘I won't go into who he told me it was, nor how and why he even had the photo, but take it from me, to say I was shocked would be an understatement. He went on to elaborate about his grimy sex secrets, and the way he operated. ‘By now my head was spinning. I didn't know whether to feel flattered that he was confiding this information so soon after meeting me, or completely grossed out at how he disgusting he was. But, I needed him. ‘He went on to tell me more disgusting pieces of information about his sex life, as well as enlightening me about his sexual cravings. ‘I truly didn't know if he was trying to impress me, flirt with me, or ask for some kind of retribution. It was the most bizarre experience I had ever had, and I've had many. ‘I asked him how he'd never ‘got caught’, and why any of this had never been in the media. ‘He replied: ‘You will never read anything negative about me, the press need me too much. I have them in the palm of my hand.’ ‘And he pointed to various framed front-page stories he had brokered for numerous people. ‘He gave me a personally signed copy of his autobiography to read and also boasted about Rebecca Loos and her story with David Beckham that he handled. ‘I was blown away by what I was hearing, and disappointed that the family-man caring image he put across in the media was all just a sham.’ Ms Symonds, pictured on ITV's Lorraine Live last year, revealed the details of her sordid business meeting with Clifford in her newspaper column . She told how she was ‘deflated’ when . Clifford said it would cost her £15,000 a month for his company to . represent her for public relations. She . writes: ‘Then, Max did something else. He propositioned me there and . then in his office. He told me how we could have some fun together and . that ‘we could look after each other.’ ‘He . also went on to tell me that if the dating site would agree to his fees . then he would help me out in the media, and promote my book on the . side, for free. ‘I realise . now, in hindsight, he was grooming me. He then gave me his mobile . number, and I gave him mine, and as I was about to leave, he suggested I . meet him in the office toilets. ‘I was shell-shocked. I made an excuse and I left to go back to my hotel. ‘I'd been booked to go back for a follow-up meeting with him two days later, which I did. He and I had also shared a few texts in between. ‘As I sat down in the leather chair again, I realised this second meeting was going to be more about business. Albeit somewhat monkey-business, but business nevertheless. ‘Max told me he'd looked at my book, and liked it. He said he would like to put me in touch with a publisher friend of his. ‘He'd also read the reality show concept I'd written - based on infidelity and getting people to STOP cheating - and said he'd liked it a lot. ‘I'll get this in front of Simon [Cowell] if you want me to and if he likes it he may help you too,’ he stated confidently. ‘He went on to flatter me (it gets you everywhere right?) by telling me that I had a great message and I was bringing something new and different to the market with my work. 'Business meeting': Ms Symonds and Clifford had sex in the disabled toilet of the offices of Max Clifford Associates in London's Mayfair . ‘He said I had some great ideas, I was smart and articulate, I was a good-looking girl, and that I just needed a bit of luck. ‘By now I was really starting to see a pattern about how this man operated. You scratch my back (and other parts) and I'll scratch yours. ‘You stroke my ego (and other parts) and I'll stroke yours. I could see I was going to have to go along with it all if I had any hope of making it in this business. ‘I was naïve and desperate in many ways, but I wasn't a kid and I wasn't stupid. I had lived and worked in LA and knew all about the casting couches. ‘In hindsight that's how toxic this business can be, and how desperate people can be to get a break into it. I'm not proud of any of this, and I began to wonder how - in the space of just a few days - my business meetings with Max Clifford could have possibly turned into what it was becoming. ‘We chatted on a few other ideas, and . he called in his PR manager to join us and take some follow-up notes, . and to make sure the dating site received his fee proposal contract the . next day. ‘After she exited, . and as our meeting was coming to a close, Max made it clear that I was . to go to the toilets outside the main office door when I left, and to . wait for him in there. ‘But Max,’ I said nervously, ‘What if any of the . girls out in the office see me going in there and you coming in?’ ‘Don't worry it's foolproof,’ he replied. ‘It will just look like you're turning left to get into the lift down to the lobby.’ ‘He was right. I guessed he had given these instructions before. Max Clifford's  daughter Louise, 42, who suffers from rheumatoid arthritis, has been working with her father for 14 years and gave evidence defending him during his trial . ‘As I took the walk of shame towards the location of the Max Clifford Associates's toilets, the thing that would shock - and sicken - me the most, was when I found out Max Clifford's casting couch would turn out to be his daughter's specially adapted disabled toilet cubicle. ‘That is something I can't ever forget. ‘But what could I do? I was there now, I was in the toilet, and that lock was about to be turned. Literally! ‘Without going into detail here, none of what happened in there was a pleasant experience for me, although it seemed to be for him. ‘He was extremely controlling and acted as if he was on a mission. All I kept thinking was that I hoped something would come out of it. Sadly it never did. ‘Unsurprisingly, all the promises of help with my career never ever materialised. It saddens and sickens me to my stomach to this very day.’ Ms Symonds is just one of a string of women who has come forward in the wake of the guilty verdict. Yesterday former dancer Sharon Elliott, 48, from Cheltenham, revealed she brutally assaulted by disgraced PR guru Max Clifford in a nightclub toilet cubicle 30 years ago. Earlier this week, a woman, using the pseudonym Cathy Johnson, partially waived her anonymity to speak of how she was abused by Clifford aged 15. Max Clifford’s daughter Louise, 42, vehemently defended her father in court but prosecutors said she was tainted by her blind loyalty to her father. Upon his conviction, she showed no emotion in the public gallery and stood by his side as he left court. Ms Clifford was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis when she was six and has undergone a string of operations. She has worked for her father for the past 14 years.","'Professional mistress' Sarah Symonds claims she had sex with Clifford .

"By . Sara Malm . A top television executive has taken the blame for a public street fight with his best friend, Australia’s third richest man, outside a luxury apartment complex at Sydney's Bondi Beach on Sunday. David Gyngell, 47, chief executive of Nine Entertainment, has said he started the brawl with billionaire casino mogul James Packer, 46, at the latter's home in the exclusive Sydney suburb. Despite Mr Gyngell admitting he instigated the fight, and that no complaints have been made, police are now investigating the incident which was captured on camera and widely published in newspapers across Australia this morning. Mischief managed: David Gyngell, left, has admitted he started the fight with his billionaire best friend James Packer, pictured right on Tuesday with a black eye, at Packer's luxury apartment block in Sydney . Mr Gyngell and Mr Packer’s fathers revolutionised the television industry in Australia and as well as being best friends since high school, they were each other’s best men at their weddings. Mr Gyngell’s television company, The Nine Network, later broadcast a statement where he accepted blame for the fight on the curb outside James Mr Packer’s flat on Sunday. ‘David Gyngell respects the job police do and will cooperate fully with their investigation,’ the statement said. ‘He also fully accepts that he was the instigator of the incident,’ it said. ‘Clearly had he not turned up at Mr Packer's premises in an angry mood, then the confrontation would never have occurred.’ The morning after: TV boss David Gyngell leaves James Packer's Bondi Beach house on Monday, the day after the fight . Looking a bit better: James Packer's shiner had cleared up on Tuesday afternoon when he was pictured out in Sydney with his mother Roz . News Corp., headed by Mr Packer and Mr Gyngell’s long-time friend Lachlan Murdoch, reportedly paid more than $200,000 for pictures of the outside Mr Packer's luxury apartment at Bondi Beach on Sunday. James Packer is chairman of Crown Resorts and has interests in casinos in Australia, Macau and Manila. Forbes lists him as Australia's third-richest person worth an estimated $6.6 billion and he is allegedly dating supermodel Miranda Kerr. It is said that the fight started after Mr Packer sent angry texts to Mr Gyngell after seeing a van from the latter’s television channel parked near his apartment and assumed Nine were trying to catch him and Miss Kerr together. Nine employee Nick Tokic later told . reporters that he lived near Mr Packer and had brought the van home . overnight for an early job Monday morning. Mr . Packer had just returned home to Sydney from Jerusalem and was met by . an angry Mr Gyngell blocking his driveway when he arrived at his flat. Cause of it all? Packer is said to have become angry when he thought a TV van from Gyngell's network was trying to catch him with his alleged new girlfriend, supermodel Miranda Kerr, pictured with her son Flynn in Sydney on the day of the fight . By his side: David Gyngell was James Packer's best man when he  married his ex-wife Erica in 2007 (pictured) Best man: At the 2007 wedding of James Packer . and Erica Baxter (above, left), in the south of France, David Gyngell .

The pair fought for several minutes while Mr Packer's driver and security guard attempted to separate them. Mr Packer and Mr Gyngell released a joint media statement on Monday which they said would be their last word on the fight. ‘We have been friends for 35 years and still are,’ they said. ‘In that time, we have had our fair share of ups and downs.’ New South Wales state police on Tuesday said they were investigating the melee and appealed for any witnesses to come forward, despite no official complaint being made.

"By . Sara Malm . A Russian World War I destroyer has been found at the bottom of the Black Sea - with its ten-ton gun still intact. The torpedo-equipped destroyer, called the Lieutenant Zatsarenny, was sunk by a German cruiser after it hit a sea mine in 1917. It now lies 90ft underwater near Zmeinyj Island - also known as Snake Island – off the coast of Ukraine. Treasure trove: Underwater photographer Andrey Nekrasov, 42, swims next to the wreck of a Russian torpedo-boat destroyer that was sunk in the First World War . The ship, which was part of the Russian Imperial Navy, was sunk 97 years ago by the Breslau, an infamous German light cruiser which stalked Black Sea shipping during the Great War. The Lieutenant Zatsarenny was equipped with a massive 120-millimeter gun which weighed ten tons. The gun is still intact and attached to the ship’s deck. Underwater photographer Andrey Nekrasov, 42, was among a diving team which explored the wreck. He said: ‘It was amazing to dive a wreck which had been on the sea bed for more than 90 years. The gun was particularly impressive to look at. It was like swimming next to a piece of history.’ The island of Zmeinyj was a watch post during World War One, and in 1917 the Breslau attacked the island, taking 11 Russian and Romanian prisoners captive. Heavy artillery: The 120-millimeter gun, weighing ten tons, is still attached to the deck of the Lieutenant Zatsarenny . Battle over: The Lieutenant Zatsarenny, was sunk on June 17th, 1917, by a German cruiser called the Breslau which had planted sea mines near the island . Interesting finds: A diver next to one of the destroyer's torpedo tubes. which has been left untouched for nearly 100 years . The order was given to restore the . watch post at Zmeinyj and the Lieutenant Zatsarenny left Odessa, Ukraine . on the morning of June 17th. Unfortunately the Lieutenant Zatsarenny was put on a collision course with one of the sea mines laid out by the Breslau. At 1.30pm the destroyer struck a mine and a charge with 114 kilograms of explosives ripped through its hull. The . explosion killed 37 crew members and passengers. The Lieutenant . Zatsarenny sank to the bottom of the sea, nearly three miles off the . coast of the island. Mayday: Divers swimming next to the wreckage of the Lieutenant Zatsarenny in the Black Sea . Destroyed destroyer: The Lieutenant Zatsarenny sank to the bottom of the sea, nearly three miles off the coast of Zmeinyj Island, where it remains to this day . Deep grave: The Lieutenant Zatsarenny now lies off the coast of Zmeinyj Island, also known as Snake Island, in the Black Sea . Leftovers: Torpedos stored in the hull of the Lieutenant Zatsarenny . The Lieutenant Zatsarenny was one of a number of Russian destroyers named after Crimean war heroes. It was part of a fleet launched in Nikolayev in 1907. The Lieutenant Zatsarenny was the first of these to sink. The other ships sank in the First World War, but all were raised during the Soviet period and used as scrap metal. Mr Nekrasov said: ‘The only ship in this fleet that we can see and touch today is the unlucky Lieutenant Zatsarenny. ‘History loves such paradoxes.

As soldiers marched in formation, missiles and jetfighters were on display, and troops showed off their range of camouflage suit, the president of Iran saw the opportunity to emphasize his moderate policies.

"By . Sara Malm . A boy suffering from more than 110 seizures a day is trying raise £65,000 to fund treatment that could eliminate his convulsions for good. Max McGhie, 13, from East Kilbride, Scotland, has a rare form of drug-resistant epilepsy which is so severe he has almost lost the ability to speak. Max and his family now hope that treatment in the U.S. could offer a way out, and perhaps eliminate his seizures for good. Hoping for help: Max McGhie, pictured with his mother Seonaid, has Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome, a rare form of epilepsy which sees him suffer over 110 seizures a day . Max has Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome, an uncommon strain of the condition leaving him in such severe convulsions medication does not help. As a result of the severity of his spasms and the cocktail of drugs he has to take, Max's speech has almost disappeared. Max and his family, mother Seonaid, father Douglas and his ten-year-old sister Charli are trying to raise £65,000 to send him to Miami, Florida for treatment. Mrs McGhie says the family have no other options, having exhausted all alternatives available to them in the UK. During the first week at the US centre, Max will have a variety of assessments which will help determine what treatment he receives in the second week of his fortnight-long visit. Max was diagnosed with Lennox-Gastaut when he was four, and has been confined to a wheelchair, dependent on drugs, since . Raising hope: Max and his family, mother Seonaid, father Douglas and sister Charli are hoping to raise £65,000 to send him to Miami, Florida for specialist treatment . Musical mind: Although he struggles to walk out of his wheelchair, Max loves his drum kit and to play football with his friends . Mrs McGhie said: ‘We have tried everything we can in Britain to give Max a better quality of life. He's on five different drugs at the moment, and we're still in pretty poor control. Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome occurs in one . in every 100 children with epilepsy and it is believed the condition may . account for a mere three per cent of all childhood epilepsies. The . condition starts in childhood, typically between the ages of three and . five, and males are five times more likely to be affected than females. The . most common type of seizure that affects those with the condition is . atonic seizures, where the casualty falls to the ground. However, sufferers can also experience absence seizures, where the person with epilepsy can appear vacant for several minutes. People . with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome have an higher mortality rate than their peers, which is believed to be due to poorly . controlled seizures and injuries from falls. ‘Max . received a vagus nerve implant, which is a small box under his arm that . is supposed to help us to monitor and control his seizures. ‘But as soon as we turned it on, Max passed out for half an hour. It was scary, we thought we'd lost him.’ Despite having to be under constant supervision, Max loves playing the drums. Despite having to spend 90 per cent of his time confined in a wheelchair, he loves playing football with his friends, who are all helping to raise funds for his treatment. So far the Send Max to Miami Campaign has held a boxing night and a swim across Loch Fine in an attempt to raise the funds. Mrs McGhie said: ‘I genuinely don't think we would have got any money if it wasn't for their support. ‘I'm so thankful for the support we have had so far, it's very touching and heart-warming. ‘If I think about it too much, it just makes me want to cry.’ Max's epilepsy is so severe he has almost lost the ability to speak, but his mother hopes the treatment in the U.S. might eliminate his seizures for good . Monique McAdams, chief executive of the East Kilbride Community Trust, is also walking the West Highland Way to help raise money for the treatment. Monique has known Max for many years and is hopeful more people will get involved and support him. Monique said: ‘Anything anyone can do to help is welcomed, whether it's donations or fundraising. ‘Our charity is only five years old, so we are still young, but we want to help raise awareness of Max's condition, then, hopefully, it will help raise money for Max. ‘I really want people to know it doesn't have to be a big, grand gesture to help, even just a small amount could really make the difference.’ To support Max and his family in raising money for treatment - visit their JustGiving page.","Max McGhie, 13, from Scotland, has Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome .

"By . Sara Malm . A teenage boy who'd gone into cardiac arrest was brought back to life by his friends, who were able to perform CPR thanks to a First Aid class they'd remembered from school. Joel Massey, 14, had a heart attack and suddenly collapsed while playing football with his three friends Sam Seaborn, Rhodri Whittaker and Ben Stevens, all 16, near his home in Ledbury, Hertfordshire. Joel’s heart stopped for ten minutes, but thanks to his friends’ quick thinking, he is expected to make a full recovery. Lifesavers: Thanks to his friends Sam Seaborn, Ben Stevens and Rhodri Whittaker, Joel Massey survived a ten-minute cardiac arrest on the football pitch earlier this month . Joel suffers from congenial heart disease Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, an electrical defect which sometimes sees him suffer heart palpitations. When he collapsed during a kick-about on April 12, his three friends were able to think back to a biology lesson on First Aid, and remembered what to do. While Sam ran for help, Rhodri dialled 999 and Ben started performing CPR until an ambulance arrived. Paramedics used a defibrillator to restart his heart and he was taken by ambulance to Birmingham Children's Hospital. Collect photo of Joel Massey mountain biking with his friend  Rhodri Whittaker . Important lessons: When Joel collapsed, Sam and Rhodri, pictured left and right, were able to call for help while Ben, centre, performed CPR after remembering what he had learned on the Duke of Edinburgh scheme and in biology . Joel . was diagnosed with Wolff-Parkinson-White when he was 13, and although . sufferers very rarely are at risk of cardiac arrest, those who are tend . to be much older than Joel. In Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, the heart beats abnormally fast due to an extra electrical connection in the heart. It is one of the most common causes of an abnormally fast heart rate in infants and children, but although the syndrome is congenital, it is often not detected until the child is 10-13. The heart of a person with WPW will suddenly suffer heart palpitations, before the heartbeat stopps or slows down abruptly. The length and frequency of these episodes varies from person to person. In many cases, episodes of abnormal heart activity associated with WPW syndrome are harmless, don't last long and settle down on their own without treatment. Source: NHS Choices . Today, Joel has been reunited with his best friends as they were awarded a certificate for their heroic actions. He said: ‘I really can't remember any of it. 'I can remember earlier that day but all I know from what happened is what I have been told. ‘It has been frustrating being stuck in hospital now because I feel fine. 'I can't believe what the boys did. I am indebted to them really. They saved my life. ‘I think it has brought us all a lot closer together.’ Joel’s friend Ben carried out CPR and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation after remembering a lesson he had in school the year before. He said: ‘We'd had a bike ride and had stopped to play a game of football when Joel suddenly collapsed. ‘We thought he was mucking about at first so kicked the ball to him but he didn't react so we knew then that something was seriously wrong. Back on his feet: Joel, pictured at Birmingham Children's Hospital with his mother Andrea, father James and his twin sister Imogen, is expected to make a full recovery . Best buddies: The 16-year-olds, pictured L-R are Ben, Rhodri and Sam have all been awarded for their bravery when Joel suffered a cardiac arrest . ‘I think we just did what we did automatically; I don't think it really sunk in until Joel had been put in the ambulance. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a first aid technique that can be used if someone is not breathing properly or if their heart has stopped. Always start with calling 999 before performing any type of CPR.  If you have not been trained in CPR, your should do chest compression only: . Try to perform 100-120 chest compressions a minute. If you’ve been trained in CPR  you should give chest compressions with rescue breaths. Source: NHS Choices . ‘I . had done some CPR as part of Duke of Edinburgh award scheme and we had a . lesson about the heart in biology last year so I just did what I could. ‘Joel was sick as well so I knew we had to clear his airways and I did mouth-to-mouth.’ Joel's mother Andrea, 44, a nurse, said yesterday: ‘Joel is very lucky to have such good friends. ‘They saved his life, I hate to think what would have happened if he was on his own. ‘Everyone should learn how to do CPR because you never know when you'll need to use it.’ Joel is expected to be in hospital until Tuesday when he will undergo a cardiac ablation to repair his irregular heartbeat. Cardiologist Dr Vinay Bhole, who is treating Joel, said: ‘With Joel's condition it is an extra electrical condition in the heart and mostly it didn't cause problems. ‘Certainly not heart attacks anyway. ‘The majority of young people don't collapse. But because Joel did we are going to do the operation to hopefully get rid of that extra electrical connection . ‘If it is successful he will not need any more medication and if it is not then he will need another operation so we can try again.’","Joel Massey, 14, has heart disease Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome .

"By . Sara Malm . The Norwegian ‘Slow-TV’ movement has been a surprising success in its home country, and the concept is now being taken across the pond. Norway has developed an international reputation for its series of 'Slow-TV' programmes, including a live-broadcast of a seven-hour train journey and the creation of a sweater, from sheep to knitted garment. Los Angeles-based production company LMNO Productions, has bought the U.S. rights to the concept and is set to start making ‘ambiance shows’ for the American audience this year. The Scandinavian way: A U.S. production company has bought the rights to Norwegian 'Slow TV' which has seen shows such as a seven-hour broadcast of a train journey from Oslo to Bergen (pictured), knitting TV and a live feed from a bird house . LMNO Productions, which also makes TLC's The Little Couple', are hoping to adapt the concept to reflect American past-times such as wildlife observing and cross-country travel, and hope to be premiering their first shows as early as this summer. ‘It doesn’t compete for your attention,' Lori Rothschild Ansaldi of LMNO said. 'In a world where we have this many channels and every channel has a docu-soap about some outrageous personality who lives unapologetically and sort of yells at us, as television viewers... This was just the opposite. 'This one allows you to watch and just sit back and relax. Not in a boring way but in a really ""that’s different"" sort of way. It allows you to breathe.’ The Norwegian ‘Slow TV’ was born on state broadcaster NRK in 2009 with centenary of the Bergen railway line. Americanized 'Slow TV': LMNO Productions will now attempt to make their own versions of success concepts such as the 134-hours journey of a Norwegian ship . Well pitched: Norwegian reality TV show Piipshow sees birds hang out in their coffee shop-themed bird feeder . Rather than commission a conventional feature programme on the line, NRK instead decided to stick a camera on a train and broadcast the entire seven-hour trip from Oslo to Bergen, interweaving archive footage to liven up the programme. Remarkably, it was a roaring success, with 1.2 million viewers, nearly a quarter of the population of Norway, tuning in for at least part of the trip. Since then, the network has broadcast a cruise journey, a fire being slowly built and burned, and more recently, the knitting of a jumper - starting with the sheep from which the wool came. Earlier this month, the tax-funded channel began the online broadcast of Piipshow, a live stream of birds and squirrels hanging out in a feeder that looks like a coffee shop. The show is due to air until June 2014, with the best action usually taking place during daylight hours. Fans can watch live via NRK's website.","Norwegian concept of 'Slow TV' set to arrive in the U.S.

"By . Sara Malm . Detailed images two American ships that sank off the coast of England during a pre-D-Day training exercise in World War II have been recorded by a U.S. submarine. The images, recorded by a Massachusetts company that surveyed the wreckage to mark the 70th anniversary of the sinking, are the first in high definition. The two ships were sunk off by German forces during Exercise Tiger on April 28, 1944, claiming the lives of 749 U.S. soldiers and sailors. In memoriam: A sonar image  shows wreckage of the bow of an American World War II ship on the bottom of the English Channel . The company behind the images, . Hydroid, based in Bourne, Massachusetts, said they had become interested . in exploring the area because of the upcoming anniversary of the . attack. The unmanned submarine recorded images of the two boats about 50 meters beneath the surface of the English Channel. Divers . have accessed the site before, but the submarine provided the highest . quality images yet, including one showing a boat's upturned stern . ‘Using the AUV we could get down very close to the wreck,’ Richard Williams, regional manager for Hydroid Europe, said. Exercise Tiger, also known as Operation Tiger remains one of the least known Allied disasters of World War II. The ships were sunk by German tornadoes during the botched Exercise Tiger off the coast of Devon in April 1944, which took the lives of 749 U.S. soldiers . It was the code name for a series of rehearsal exercises ahead of D-Day which took place on Slapton Sands, Devon in April 1944. An . Allied convoy which had positioned itself to prepare for a landing of . Slapton Beach, which was to act as a ‘fake Utah Beach’, was attacked by . E-boats of the German Kriegsmarine, . The fast-moving torpedo boats sank two Allied ships and badly damaged a third, killing 749 U.S. servicemen. Many of the casualties drowned while waiting to be rescued, having abandoned ships under fire. The . soldiers were not used to being at sea and had put on their lifebelts . incorrectly and were pushed underwater by their combat packs. The company behind the images, Hydroid, based in Bourne, Massachusetts, said they had become interested in exploring the area because of the upcoming anniversary of Exercise Tiger . Survivors were sworn to secrecy to ensure that the plans for D-Day remained unknown. The casualties were not announced until nearly two months after the invasion of Normandy. Although . it has been accused of being a cover-up, due to the initial secrecy and . the huge impact of D-Day that followed, Exercise Tiger was long simply . forgotten. Full details were . not known until 1974, when the records were declassified as a result of . the efforts of Ken Small, a local man who had discovered evidence of . Exercise Tiger while beachcombing. An annual wreath-laying to honour the victims is scheduled for Monday at U.S. Coast Guard Station Barnegat Light in New Jersey. Hydroid will donate the images to the United Kingdom's National Archive and local memorials.","Two ships were sunk on April 28, 1944, killing 749 U.S. servicemen .

"By . Sara Malm . A woman has been taken into psychiatric care after allegedly stalking former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg. Ceceilia Berkowitz, 35, a failed 2013 NYC mayoral candidate, was carted off by security after she was spotted ‘acting irrationally’ at Mr Bloomberg’s offices. Ms Berkowitz, who had repeatedly tweeted her excitement about seeing her ‘close friend’ Bloomberg, was placed under psychiatric observation at Bellevue Hospital, police have said. 'Stalker': Ceceilia Berkowitz, 35, pictured with then-mayor Michael Bloomberg in 2012, has been placed under psychiatric observation at a New York hospital after turning up at Mr Bloomberg's offices and making several attempts to approach him . Big fan: Ms Berkowitz proudly tweeted this unnerving image of her photographing Michael Bloomberg without his knowledge . Ms Berkowitz has allegedly had a history of stalking the former mayor, making several attempts to get hold of his personal phone number and even proudly posting a strange photograph showing her taking a picture of Mr Bloomberg. The former college professor was removed from Mr Bloomberg’s offices by police on Wednesday after attempting to make contact with the former mayor, New York Daily News reports. The tweets were all variations of the same message: ‘Great plans tomorrow to see Mike Bloomberg at Bloomberg LP - can't wait to see my close friend since around the time of Hurricane Irene!’ In her Twitter bio, Ms Berkowitz describes herself as: ‘President, Committee & recent NYC Mayoral Candidate Professor Finance/Math (Wharton '00, Rutgers MBA '08). Friends with Mayor Bloomberg.’ Twitter truths? The former mayoral candidate describes herself as a professor of finance and maths and 'friends with mayor Bloomberg' in her Twitter bio . These three tweets, posted minutes apart, alerted security at Bloomberg's offices ahead of her visit . Her display photo on the microblogging network is one of her with then-mayor Michael Bloomberg from 2012. She has used Twitter to make a number of attempts to contact Mr Bloomberg in the recent months, including asking several people to give out his details. Earlier this month she posted: ‘Hi to my friend @mikebloomberg Do you want to join me and @galeabrewer for breakfast?’ In March she tweeted former Newark Mayor Cory Booker, who also appears in her Twitter picture: ‘Hi. I was wondering if you might have Mike Bloomberg's cell #? Also, it might be good to meet w u in NJ or NYC. Any plans2B?’ Ms Berkowitz, a former adjunct professor at Hunter College, City University of New York, has also made several attempts to get in touch with Mr Bloomberg via Bloomberg TV anchor Betty Liu and Bloomberg CEO Dan Doctoroff. On April 7 she wrote: '@bettyintheloop @Bloomberg .@bloombergtv #pennalumni Hi Betty. Just retweeted some of your good tweets & I hope to catch you by cell soon!' Determined: Ms Berkowitz, pictured with a man believed to be her partner, made several attempts to contact Michael Bloomberg via twitter and by asking staff at Blooomberg TV for his phone number . Inspiration: Ms Berkowitz ran for mayor of New York City in 2013, telling journalists that she was inspired to run for the post by Michael Bloomberg .

My best number 917-923-5760' Last year, she unsuccessfully ran for mayor of New York City, saying that her ‘friend’ Mr Bloomberg has inspired her to candidate for the post. In an interview with Capital New York, she said becoming mayor would be a good opportunity for her because she had good experience in starting new jobs and was prepared to spend her own money on 'getting ready'. She told journalist Azi Paybarah, who interviewed her after she contacted him on Twitter to announce that she was running for mayor, that she lost a lot of money working in higher education 'because I had to get to work on time and the students needed me to always show up'. ‘Even if I lose money myself - Mayor Bloomberg himself doesn't take a salary - I would be prepared to spend the money on getting ready, like, if I have an emergency and need to buy new shoes.’ Ms Berkowitz is reportedly still under observation at Bellevue Hospital, and no charges has been made against her.","Cecelia Berkowitz has been placed under observation at NY hospital .

"By . Lucy Osborne . A child rapist who abused his stepdaughter from the age of eight and sent her threatening letters from prison is back on the streets after a legal blunder. His victim Jo, now 43, said she fears for her and her daughter’s safety, knowing the paedophile ‘could be round the corner’. The former nurse, who does not wish to give her surname, said: ‘He will come for me, he has made that clear.’ Released after blunder: Keith John Williams, 57, was compared to serial killer Fred West by a judge after he carried out a series of child rapes. He was released this week after serving 15 years following an MoJ error . Keith John Williams, who was handed six life sentences 15 years ago, was deemed too dangerous for open prison in November. Threats: Jo, now 43, fears for her and her daughter's safety, knowing the paedophile could be 'around the corner' He was not due to appear before the Parole Board again for another two years. But the 56-year-old had to be given a second hearing six months later after a case worker failed to show his lawyers a victim statement. At the hearing on Thursday, the Parole Board decided to release him. His stepdaughter said she has no idea how the board’s view can have ‘changed this dramatically’. The serial rapist, who waged a campaign of abuse against his victims over two decades, continued to contact Jo and her stepbrother from jail. He made tormenting phone calls as recently as 2011 and sent menacing letters saying such things as ‘see you soon’ and ‘this isn’t over’. Despite such behaviour he was granted parole in 2012, meaning he was allowed out of prison to work during the day and sometimes overnight. But the former pub landlord broke his parole terms by staying overnight with his daughter, next-door to the mother of a young girl, Jo was told by the Parole Board. When he was moved from his open prison to a closed one in November Jo, who runs a support group for abuse victims, was relieved to hear Williams was no longer roaming the streets. But due to the procedural error, a fresh hearing had to be arranged – and she had to endure the whole process again. The Parole Board apologised for the ‘heartache’ of having to wait for the results of another hearing, but after its decision to release Williams this week, Jo said: ‘Something has gone seriously wrong here. If this human error hadn’t have happened, he would still be locked up. ‘A paedophile can’t have changed this dramatically in just six months. In November they said he was too dangerous for open prison. Now he is roaming the streets. It’s outrageous.’ Jo, who lost so much weight after learning her stepfather was in an open prison she dropped four dress sizes, added: ‘I don’t understand how someone who is so obviously still a danger is allowed to walk free. He is a monster, not a man. ‘The damage he caused me will last a lifetime … Sentences for paedophiles and rapists like him should reflect that. He has essentially served just two years for each of his victims.’ During his trial, Williams was compared to serial killer Fred West (pictured). He attacked his victim in bars he used to run . Jo’s MP, Heather Wheeler, said last night that the case was a ‘catalogue of errors’, adding: ‘It was absolutely clear when it came up at the last parole meeting that he should not be released. But now a simple error in the paperwork has changed all that … this shouldn’t be able to happen.’ Fellow Tory MP Priti Patel said: ‘His victims, along with the public, will struggle to understand how justice has been served having been released following such sickening crimes.’ Jo told the Mail: ‘It should be the rapists and paedophiles who have to fight for their rights, not the victims.’ She was raped and attacked repeatedly by Williams and some of his friends, between 1979 and 1985, at the family’s South Derbyshire pub – two minutes from where she now lives. Her stepfather, who was convicted of abducting a 14-year-old girl in 1976, left after having an affair and Jo told no-one of the abuse. But as she was getting her life back on track, Williams returned to the town and she broke her silence. Other victims came forward and in 1999 he was jailed for five rape charges and one of indecent assault. On his release Williams will not be tagged, but is banned from parts of Leicestershire and Derbyshire. A prison service spokesman said: ‘The [Parole] Board considers a range of factors that are likely to contribute to a reduction in risk, including behaviour and progress in custody.’","Keith John Williams given five life sentences in 1999 for string of child rapes .

"By . Lucy Osborne . A five-week-old girl was found unharmed in the wreckage of a car  after a motorway crash that killed  her mother. Farmer’s wife Joanna Bull was taking her baby to visit relatives when her car collided with a lorry. Mrs Bull, 29, died but her daughter Ruby was rescued from the twisted metal of the green Peugeot 406. Joanna Bull died in a car crash on the M40 near Bicester, Oxfordshire. Her newborn baby Ruby was found unscathed lying next to the body of her mother by emergency services . She was airlifted to hospital as a . precaution but was completely unscathed. Mrs Bull’s devastated widower . Dave is now caring for their daughter. The lorry driver is not thought to have needed hospital treatment. Mrs . Bull, known to friends as Jo, married only a year ago. After Ruby was . born Mr Bull described the baby on Facebook as ‘an amazing anniversary . present  from my gorgeous wife’. Following . Friday’s tragedy on the M40 near Bicester in Oxfordshire Mrs Bull’s . family  said in a statement: ‘Jo was vibrant, beautiful and caring in so . many ways. ‘A girl who added zest to a room and who had found true love and happiness with her husband of just one year, Dave. ‘Jo . was a loving wife, mum, daughter, sister, granddaughter, niece and . friend to so many and loved by all who knew her. To have her taken from . her family at such a happy time is utterly unbearable. 'She died on her way to visit her mum . Teresa, with her five-week-old daughter Ruby, to meet newborn cousin . Harry for the first time, and to have a catch up with big sister Soph, . and niece Nelly aged two. ‘Jo, . we never had the chance to say a proper goodbye, but we will never . forget how much fun and laughter you brought into all our lives, you . will remain in our hearts and memories always.’ Mrs . Bull, from Kenilworth, Warwickshire, had been taking Ruby to see her . own mother, Teresa, and to introduce the baby to her three-day-old . cousin Harry in Oxford when the accident happened. The baby who will never know her mother: Ruby, five weeks, survived the car crash that killer her mother . An . animal science graduate, Mrs Bull bred sheep and cattle at the farm she . ran with her husband near picturesque Kenilworth Castle. She also ran a day care and boarding home for dogs from the farm. On . the website for her company, Animal Tracks, Mrs Bull wrote: ‘After a . childhood of working with animals I went to university to study for a . BSc in animal science. ‘Since . university I have travelled extensively to Australia, southeast Asia . and  Zimbabwe. During my travels I worked on ranches mustering sheep and . cattle on horseback and volunteering on horseback safari tours. ‘Upon . my return from travelling I worked for the Guide Dogs for the Blind . Association. It was during this time when I met my husband Dave at the . local young farmers club. Dave is a farmer and between us we rent a . traditional livestock farm where we breed both cattle and sheep.’ The . crash in which Mrs Bull died happened near junction 9 of the M40  which . was closed for several hours, causing huge tailbacks. The Oxfordshire coroner is expected to open and adjourn an inquest. Thames Valley Police are investigating the accident. The family were travelling to Warwickshire on the M40 (pictured) to visit Joanna's family for the first time after Ruby's birth.

"By . Lucy Osborne . The Spanish housing market really has hit rock bottom if this property is anything to go by. A five-bedroom cave, built into the rocks of a hillside in Andalusia, is on the market for less than the price of a family car. The unusual property, which includes a 700m-square plot of land large enough to build a swimming pool, has stunning mountain views. Bring out your inner Fred Flintstone: This cave in Spain is yours for £11,000 . Renovation required: The insides of the cave need a bit of love . The ‘Cave House’ - as it is being billed by sellers - is built into the rocks of Cuervas Del Campo near Granda – a popular holiday and retirement area in Spain. It'll cost you 14,500 euros or £11,587 if you want to live like Fred Flintstone – a bargain compared  to the average price for a family home in Britain of £250,000. The cave, being sold by Girasol Homes, is featured on property website Rightmove.com. The blurb says the property needs renovation but enjoys ‘excellent views, good access’ and is ‘south facing.’ It also has its own private drive. Despite not having any windows inside, the property enjoys plenty of light through the currently exposed entrances. You'll need to make light of living there: The cave doesn't have any windows with sunlight coming in through exposed entrances . Gloom with a view: The cave comes with amazing vistas - and enough land to build a swimming pool on . Hotspot: The cave is in an area of Spain renowned for its warm climate . A spokesman for Girasol Homes said yesterday: ‘This cave is located in the hamlet of Majaviejas, outside Cuevas del Campo, five minutes from town and naturist beach at lake Negratin. ‘Facing south and excellent views, there's a large plot of flat land in the front with plenty of room for a pool. ‘It has five bedrooms, but scope to enlarge. Water is connected at the entrance of the cave, and the electricity is 150 metres away. ‘Access to the cave is through a private road belonging to the cave.’ Mod cons: Water is connected at the entrance of the cave and the electricity is 150 metres away . Handy: The cave is just an hour and a half from the popular south-east coast of Spain . Cuevas del Campo is one of the six picturesque villages that make up the area of Baza in the Altiplano region. It covers 60 miles and has a population of approximately 2,500. The house is just a few miles from the picturesque Negratín Reservoir, which has its own beaches and water sports. It is also just an hour and a half drive to the popular south-east coast of Spain. Andalusia is the second most popular area for those looking to retire or move out to the country, after Valencia. It is favoured for its lack of crime and all-year-around warm climate. According to data collected by Spain’s National Institute of Statistics in 2011, there were 63,472 British people in Andalusia province.","A Spanish cave is on the market for less than the price of a family car .

"By . Laura Clark . and Lucy Osborne . A campaign by hardline Islamists to take control of state schools was laid bare yesterday. Revealing the shocking extent to which strict Muslim practices are being imposed on pupils and teachers alike, the chief inspector of schools said the plotters used ‘fear and intimidation’ against their opponents. Sir Michael Wilshaw said the aim of the ‘Trojan Horse’ campaign was to impose a ‘narrow faith-based ideology’ on schools in Birmingham. Scroll down for videos . Shocking: The damning report by Sir Michael Wilshaw heavily condemned the practices of senior staff, including Monzoor Hussain, assistant headteacher at Park View School, who ran assemblies on Ramadan . Music was banned at one primary, raffles and tombolas were axed from fetes for being unIslamic and boys were forced to change for PE in a store cupboard to preserve their modesty. One primary spent £32,000 on a five-star trip to Saudi Arabia from which non-Muslim pupils were barred. Children as young as six at the same school were told that Western women were ‘white prostitutes’. Launching long-awaited reports on 21 schools, Sir Michael said the widespread conspiracy had involved  fundamentalists infiltrating governing bodies. Centre of scandal: Park View School was downgraded from 'outstanding' to 'inadequate' Governors had ‘exerted inappropriate influence’ on schools leading to enforced segregation of boys and girls in some classes and a narrowing of the curriculum. The Ofsted reports – and a separate . set of Department for Education investigations – make many other . revelations including that teachers attempted to vet the script of a . nativity play. The reports were issued as: . Involved: The Golden Hillock School and Nansen Primary School were both branded 'inadequate' as a result of the inspections . Change needed: Governors . at Satley School were accused of  'refusing to accept that the school . is in a state of crisis' while governors at Oldknow Academy used the . school's budget to subsidise a trip to Saudi Arabia . Sir Michael revealed that Mr Gove had blocked his request for the right to carry out snap inspections. Ofsted’s three-month inquiry resulted in five schools being put into special measures, with a sixth having its ‘failing’ verdict reaffirmed. Eleven other schools were found to ‘require improvement’ while one was rated good and a further three outstanding. In an advice note to Mr Gove, Sir Michael warned that in some schools, heads had been forced out by bullying governors. Opposed: Tahir Alam - alleged ring-leader in the so-called plot to enforce a hardline agenda at the schools - has described the allegations as 'a witch-hunt' Failings: The practices of Shahid Akmal, the Chairman of governors at Nansen, and Waseem Yaqub, Chair of Governors at the Al-Hijrah school, have also been questioned by the report . One head was so worried about the consequences of whistle-blowing he or she insisted on meeting inspectors in a supermarket car park. ‘Some headteachers reported that there has been an organised campaign to target certain schools in Birmingham in order to alter their character and ethos,’ Sir Michael said. ‘A culture of fear and intimidation has developed in some of the schools since their previous inspection. ‘Staff and some head teachers variously described feeling “intimidated”, “undermined” or “bullied” by governors, and sometimes by senior staff, into making changes they did not support.’ Some governors were ‘trying to impose and promote a narrow faith-based ideology in what are non-faith schools’. Sir Michael suggested the governors were part of a network, noting that ‘some of these governors serve on several schools’. Headteachers had ‘identified governors who are highly influential across several of the schools that were inspected’.Claims of a co-ordinated campaign initially surfaced in the letter that triggered the Ofsted and Government investigations, which purported to describe a ‘Trojan Horse’ operation to infiltrate governing bodies and push through a strict Islamic agenda. Sir Michael last night piled further pressure on Mr Gove over his handling of the extremism threat with the disclosure that he asked for the ability to carry out snap inspections two years ago but was blocked by the Education Secretary. The claim, in a BBC Newsnight interview, came hours after Mr Gove announced a wide-ranging inquiry into the way his department dealt with warnings of extremist influence on schools in a bid to calm a damaging Cabinet row over the issue. Russell Hobby, of teaching union NAHT, said: ‘We should take comfort in the willingness of staff to resist intimidation and put their careers on the line to protect their students. ‘The reports reveal weaknesses in oversight, governance and support. They show that staff with concerns did not know where to turn.’ Governors at three schools rated inadequate have hit back at Ofsted’s findings, claiming they were a product of an ‘Islamophobic witch-hunt’. Speaking on behalf of Park View Trust, vice-chairman David Hughes said that its three schools – Park View Academy, Golden Hillock and Nansen Primary – were wrongly rated inadequate and had no links to extremism. He said the schools ‘wholeheartedly’ rejected Ofsted’s findings and said they would launch a legal challenge. Lee Donaghey, assistant principal at Park View, insisted the schools were free from strict Islamic practices. David . Hughes, the vice chair of Park View Education Trust at the centre of . the scandal, this morning furiously rejected Ofsted's findings and vowed . to fight the decision to put his schools in special measures . ‘It is simply not true that the school does not do enough to protect our pupils from the risks of extremism,’ he said. Under pressure: Razwan Faraz the deputy head at Nansen . ‘This is a normal state school like thousands of others across Britain, 98 per cent of our pupils just happen to be Muslims – British Muslims.’ In a letter to Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw, the trust said criticism of Park View was ‘laced with Islamophobic sentiment’ and asked for a re-inspection of the schools ‘under a climate that is far removed from the fallacious insinuations of radical and extremist plots that have provided the context for the current set of inspections’. Trust chairman Tahir Alam – alleged ring-leader in the so-called plot to enforce a hardline agenda at the schools – has described the allegations as ‘a witch-hunt’. But a group of female pupils at Park View backed Ofsted’s findings, saying yesterday: ‘Our school deserves this... for the things that it has done. ‘Our school is too extreme but not in a terrorist way. They are strict with us and they use religion as an excuse. Basically they don’t let boys and girls mix. ‘If they see you talking to a boy they will call your parents or come to your house, which they did to a lot of people.’ The teenage girls, who didn’t want to be identified, told Sky News that pupils were afraid to speak out about the school.

"By . Lucy Osborne . White Dee is facing calls for her to be stripped of her sickness benefits after she admitted using her notoriety to earn money from promotional work. The reality TV star – real name Deirdre Kelly – defiantly insisted, ‘I’m not doing anything wrong’ and said she would continue taking state handouts until the Prime Minister or his government stops her. The 42-year-old star of the controversial Channel 4 show Benefits Street has repeatedly claimed that she is too depressed to work. Scroll down for video . Earning power: Benefits Street star White Dee has revealed that she is earning money from her new found fame while continuing to claim Government handouts . Jaunt: White Dee during her recent trip to Magaluf. She said the shots she was seen downing were water . But this weekend the mother of two, . whose handouts equate to the take-home pay of someone earning £20,000 a . year, admitted cashing in on her growing celebrity status and enjoying . the high life through a string of appearances and promotional work. She . was pictured partying in Magaluf in Majorca and enjoying a steak dinner . at a top restaurant. Miss Kelly, who was diagnosed with depression, . gets £214 a week from a combination of Employment and Support Allowance – . formerly known as Sickness Benefit – Child Tax Credit and Child . Benefit, plus £500 a month Housing Benefit. Up front: The mother-of-two, whose real name is Deirdre Kelly, said she is declaring all her earnings to the authorities . ‘If people have a problem with how much I am getting, they should speak to David Cameron,’ she said. Her . last full-time job was at Birmingham council. She was fired in 2007 – . and narrowly avoided a jail sentence – for stealing £13,000. Last . night Conservative MP Philip Davies called on the Department for Work . and Pensions (DWP) to investigate her case. ‘I think she epitomises . everything that’s wrong with our benefits system,’ he said. Following . the popularity of Benefits Street, which showed the lives of families . on James Turner Street in Birmingham, Miss Kelly has had at least six . offers to front programmes, including one for a cookery show in France. She has done promotional work abroad, made a rap record and been DJing at nightclubs in Birmingham. She . has dined out at the city’s upmarket Malmaison hotel brasserie and is . reported to have agreed a big-money deal to appear on the next Celebrity . Big Brother. Miss Kelly told the Sun on Sunday: ‘Yes, I am taking . casual work. I won’t tell you how much I am earning but it’s not half as . much as people think.’ Speaking . of a promotional trip to Magaluf earlier this month, she said: ‘I met a . lot of nice people but it can be hard trying to smile all the time when . you’re not in the mood for it. I missed my kids.’ In . exchange for the break, she says, she agreed to be the special guest at . a pool party, judge a wet T-shirt contest and go on a bar crawl to . promote a travel firm. Earlier this year Ms Kelly was sent on a date by a third party to the four-star Malmaison Hotel in Birmingham . Despite being on benefits, Ms Kelly dined out at the brassiere restaurant where main courses cost up to £20 . But she said: ‘The pool party was not really my scene and I don’t drink, so the bar crawl was not my thing either.’ She said the shot glasses she was photographed downing were filled with water. ‘I . wouldn’t say I was miserable, but that doesn’t mean I am not depressed. I’m on sickness benefit and trying to get back into full-time work. Background: During Benefits Street, Dee said she had suffered from depression since her mother died and has 'good days and bad days' with the condition . ‘Do I have to stop claiming benefits because I spent two days in Majorca? ‘Would people be less upset if I went to Skegness?’ Miss . Kelly’s agent Barry Tomes said yesterday that not all the work she has . done has been paid, and any payment she has received is declared to the . relevant authorities. The . DWP said it would not discuss individual claimants but added: ‘Where . there is evidence of benefit fraud, we would not hesitate to . investigate.’ People are entitled to claim  Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) if their illness or disability affects their ability to work provided they are aged under 65 and not receiving Statutory Sick Pay,  Statutory Maternity Pay or Jobseeker’s Allowance. The handouts are designed to help people back into the world of work, and it is possible to apply for ESA if you’re employed, self-employed, unemployed or a student on Disability Living Allowance or Personal Independence Payment. To get ESA, claimants usually have to prove they cannot work by sending in medical certificates to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). Receipt of ESA is usually not affected if the person claiming works less than 16 house a week and earns less than £101 a week for up to a year, but if this limit is reached then the money may be withdrawn or reduced. The DWP must be notified of any change of circumstances, including if volunteer work is being carried out, and failure to do so may result in a claimant being investigated by the DWP, or even prosecuted for fraud.

"By . Dan Bloom . and Lucy Osborne . A British couple who attempted suicide hours before they were due to be extradited to the U.S. say they felt like they had no options left. Paul Dunham, who is accused of over-claiming £600,000 in expenses from a U.S. firm, spoke out as a judge warned he was at real risk of harming himself again. He and his wife Sandra - who is accused of aiding and abetting him - were remanded in custody for their own safety last night, after a court heard claims they overdosed on medication as a 'cry for help'. Scroll down for video . 'No options left': Paul and Sandra Dunham were found on Thursday hours before the planned extradition . District Judge Howard Riddle told them at Westminster Magistrates' Court: 'There is simply no other conclusion that I can reach on the face of it than at the very least it was to delay or prevent the (extradition) process from taking place. 'In 14 days or thereabouts a decision will be taken that extradition is imminent and at that stage, despite the protestations that they won't, there is a real risk they will take steps to harm themselves.' Speaking out yesterday, Mr Dunham said the pact was real and in no way a publicity stunt or an attempt to delay the extradition. He explained that he and his wife had genuinely attempted to take their own lives because they could not face the prospect of dying in a U.S. jail. The court heard they had taken enough medication to do themselves serious harm. 'We fully expected that our lives would have ended that night', he told the Daily Telegraph. Battle: The couple lost an appeal in February at the High Court, which ruled the breach of their human right to privacy was not serious enough to outweigh the need to extradite them on fraud charges, which they deny . The couple arrived under police escort yesterday at Westminster Magistrates' Court, where they were remanded . Search: Police were called to the couple's home in Northampton after they failed to answer the door . 'It's a crude thing to say, but until you try to kill yourself, you don't know what it takes to do it. We basically didn't do it soon enough. 'If the police hadn't come into the house, if they had taken a couple of hours longer, then it would have happened according to our wishes.' He added: 'We felt there was no hope - the choice was made'. The alarm was raised on Thursday morning when the Dunhams failed to answer the door of their Northampton home for a planned appointment with a local journalist. 'It's a crude thing to say, but until . you try to kill yourself, you don't know what it takes to do it' The couple, who have five . grandchildren, said they attempted the suicide pact after being told . Theresa May had cancelled a planned meeting with their MP Andrea . Leadsom. Apart from the Prime Minister, Mrs May is the only person who can halt the extradition after the pair lost a High Court . battle against extradition to Maryland on fraud charges. Mr Dunham is accused of over-claiming . $1million (£600,000) in expenses when he was chief executive of the U.S. firm PACE - but insists these were ‘wholly legitimate’ business expenses. The case has caused anger over the . use of the Extradition Act to haul them across the Atlantic for trial . for what their supporters say amounts to a civil dispute. Mrs Dunham is accused of eight counts of fraud for allegedly aiding and abetting him. The failed High Court case . heard Mr Dunham had suffered several mini-strokes and mental health . problems, and Mrs Dunham was suffering from depression. Emergency: Police were called to the Dunhams' Northampton home by a worried journalist who had arrived to take a statement from the couple - only for them to fail to answer the door . But Mr Justice Simon said the breach of the couple's human rights was not significant enough to outweigh the need to extradite them. Speaking from his hospital bed at Northampton General yesterday, where he was recovering after being taken off a drip, Mr Dunham said: ‘When we felt there was no hope, the prospect of what lay ahead of us in the US, we felt that wasn’t worth living for.’ 'If you look statistically, white collar crime has a 98 per cent chance of going to a plea bargain. 'If you look at this in the cold light of day we have gone through this rationally so many times in our minds. 'Somewhere down the line someone is either going to offer us a ridiculously long prison sentence or a plea bargain. 'We could easily be in the U.S. for six or eight years. 'We would return to the UK in our mid-sixties, with no money, no jobs and no home. Treatment: The Dunhams both spent the night at Northampton General Hospital and are expected to be taken to Westminster Magistrates court when they are discharged . 'Frankly that was a prospect we didn’t feel like enduring eight years of hell for. 'We rationally weighted up all the options and saw no other choice. 'We faced a three year wait for a . trial in the U.S. and we were already told we were going to be held in a . high security super max prison with a pretty harsh regime and it . wouldn’t have the medical facilities for my health. 'We were facing the prospect of enduring eight years of hell, and are still facing the same dilemma. 'It’s a bit like when someone has a . terminal illness, they will sometimes end their lives with the happy . memories they once had rather than face the terminal illness. 'What we did wasn’t a publicity stunt, . we fully expected not to be here today and we have to be grateful for . the police and hospital staff for how they have looked after us over the . last 24 hours. 'Now we are having to go to separate counselling meetings where we are really saying ""what’s next?""

"By . Lucy Osborne . School can be a daunting place for children with autism – with many struggling to communicate with peers and stay focussed. But one school think they have found a solution – robot teachers. Topcliffe Primary in Birmingham is the first in the country to use humanoid robots to help teach pupils with autism. Topcliffe School in Castle Vale, Birmingham, West Midlands has become the first school in the UK to use a robot to teach autistic children. Pictured are pupils Corbin Chow (left), five, and Libi Cooper (right), five, taking the £15,000 robot named 'Max' for a walk . The knee-high machines, which are designed to move in the same way as children, can be programmed to have conversations, play games, dance and even take classes. But unlike human teachers, Max and Ben – so named by the pupils – have blank features, no emotions and standardised expressions and responses. It is this, according to head teacher, Ian Lowe that makes the robots much easier for autistic to children to relate to and understand. ‘Autistic children find them less threatening and easier to engage with than adults and other children, so they provide a safe environment for them to explore and develop their communication skills,’ he said. ‘Children who first come into school unable to make eye contact with humans start to communicate through the robots. ‘They are also cute and lovable which helps capture their attention,’ he added. The mainstream state school, which caters for children without autism, has a centre dedicated to those with the disability – the long-term aim being to get them to integrate into classes with other children. Unlike human teachers, Max and Ben - so named by the pupils - have blank features, no emotions and standardised expressions and responses, which makes the robots much easier for autistic children to relate to and understand. Pictured are Corbin Chow (left), five, James Munro, six, and Libi Cooper, five . A revolution in the classroom? Max, seen here showing off his Tai Chi skills, is one of two robots donated by the University of Birmingham and Aldebaran to the school . Many autistic children have successfully been able to do so, thanks in part to the way the school has taken on such technology, according to Mr Lowe. He said several schools have been in touch who are considering investing in the technology themselves. Before Libi Cooper (pictured above) met Ben the robot, she struggled to maintain focus in lessons for more than ten minutes. But after a school year of weekly or twice weekly lessons with him, the five-year-old can now concentrate for a 20 minute session and her social skills have dramatically improved. Her teacher Richard Garland says her ability to communicate with others has seen a noticeable improvement, as has her vocabulary. ‘She can look at the robot’s body language and work out if it is shocked or surprised, for example. A skill that’s transferable to real life,’ he said. Mr Garland, who looks after a class of 6 autistic children, said: ‘It is lovely to see to see how she lights up with the robot. ‘She loves giving it hugs and adores its dancing and when it does “head shoulders knees and toes” – mirroring the robot’s moves. She’s hypnotised.’ She’ll laugh along and copy it doing the Michael Jackson Thriller dance, he said, ‘and in the morning she’ll come in and pat it on the head, saying “Are you alright, Robot?”’ ‘There’s a concentration and willingness to stay with the class that wasn’t there before. It really engages her and holds her attention for extended periods of time,’ he added. Libi’s father, Colin, who also has an autistic son, Owen, seven, at the school, said: ‘She has picked up a lot from the robot. She’ll come back from school and tell us all about the games she’s been playing. ‘We have seen a vast improvement in Libi over the past six months. ‘It’s impossible to say how much this is down to the robot because the school has been doing a lot of good work, but I think it’s a big part of the jigsaw.’ Mr Cooper, a driving instructor, said his son is also transfixed by the robot who he calls ‘Buzz Lightyear.’ ‘Owen thinks it’s like something out of Toy Story – a toy come to life,’ he said. ‘It has given him confidence and brought him out of his shell. ‘My wife and I are blown away by what it can do and are very open-minded to the different technology that’s out there that can help our kids,’ he added. Topcliffe volunteered itself two years ago to become something of a research laboratory for the University of Birmingham and Aldebaran, the creators of the robots. Aldebaran donated the machines - which cost about £15,000 each to produce – to the school, in order to learn how their technology could help children with disabilities. ‘It has worked out to be very mutually beneficial,’ Mr Lowe said. ‘They gave us the robots and we report back.’ Teachers can communicate through the robot for an entire class by writing sentences into a computer - allowing the children to believe they are being taught by it . The knee-high machines, which are designed to move in the same way as children, can be programmed to have conversations, play games, dance and even take classes . He explained that the university are constantly developing new features based on suggestions from teachers about what would benefit the pupils. For instance, teachers can communicate through the robot for an entire class by writing sentences into a computer – allowing the children to believe they are being taught by it. A feature recently developed even allows teachers and parents to track a child’s progression by recording all of their results in games played with the robot and by tracking their responses. The most popular educational game is ‘animal recognition’, where the robot asks a child to identify a card with a particular animal on. A feature recently developed allows teachers and parents to track a child's progression by recording all of their results in games played with the robot and by tracking their responses . 'We've seen some lovely signs of progression in children who say the robot is their ""best friend"" after initially being scared of it,' said Ben Waterworth, Head of ICT at the school . For example, the robot will say ‘Find me a cat’, and the pupil will have to go through a pack of cards then hold the correct one up to its face. If they get it right, the robot will congratulate them and do a dance and if they don’t it will tell them ‘hard luck, you could do better’. The response is always exactly the same, to limit any confusion and to ‘build trust’, according to Head of ICT at the school, Ben Waterworth. ‘We’ve seen some lovely signs of progression in children who say the robot is their “best friend” after initially being scared of it,’ he said. ‘It helps their listening skills and mimicry, also helping them learn how to take it in turns and how to stay focussed - a stepping stone to interaction with people. ‘It is also useful in helping teachers control the class, getting them to listen and sit down for instance.’ Dr Karen Guldberg, director of the University of Birmingham’s Autism Centre for Education and Research, said: ‘To be effective in teaching children with autism, it is crucial to find ways to motivate and engage them. ‘It is also important to communicate clearly by using simple language and giving children plenty of time to take in instructions. ‘The robot does all those things and has therefore been a very effective tool to support the children’s communication and interaction in the classroom.’ Dr Guldberg added that a well thought out programme could also work well in mainstream classes.‘If you can meet the needs of children autism you can meet the needs of all children,’ she said. ‘When people feel safe and are motivated they learn much better.’ ICT Leader Ben Waterworth, 28, stands with 'Max' the robot at the mainstream state school, which has a centre dedicated to those with autism .","Topcliffe Primary in Birmingham is the first in the country to use humanoid robots to help teach pupils with autism .

"By . Lucy Osborne . Thousands of job seekers queued for more than three hours in a desperate attempt to nab one of just 40 positions at supermarket giants Aldi. The job hopefuls began queuing at 10am, despite the interviews not starting until 1pm, forcing staff to start 20 minutes early on Friday. At least 1,500 candidates queued around the block for just 40 positions now available at Aldi stores across the Midlands. Hopefuls: More than 1,000 jobseekers queued for just 40 jobs with budget supermarket chain Aldi . Each candidate was given a mini-interview with management teams from branches of the supermarket before handing in their CV and contact details. A teenager, who did not want to be named and joined the winding queue at noon at the Bridgnorth store in Shropshire said: ‘I knew it started at 1pm so I wanted to get here early, but I didn’t expect there to be that many people. ‘I walked right up to the store and then noticed the queue and my heart sank, I walked to the back and it just went on and on, I didn’t think it would ever stop. At least 1,500 candidates queued around the block for just 40 positions now available at Aldi stores across the Midlands . ‘Before I got there I thought I would have a good chance of getting the job, but when I saw all those people I lost hope a bit. ‘The mini-interview went well, but it is hard to know if I will get the job as they have seen so many people. ‘It is hard for young people like myself to get a job, there just isn’t the opportunities out there and people don’t want to give you a chance. ‘I went for this job because you have to take what you can get, like I said, the opportunities are limited.’ The applicants, who were hoping for stock and store assistant positions with a minimum of 20 hours a week are likely to find out if they have got the job within the next month. A mother-of-two, who queued since 10am added: ‘I heard a rumour that there would be a lot of people here so I got here at 10am and was one of the first. ‘I had to wait three hours, but it was relief when I saw how many people really did turn up, I couldn’t believe it. ‘It looked more like auditions for X-Factor, not a job for Aldi. ‘Hopefully I got the job, but you never know, with over a thousand people there it is hard to judge, I don’t know if being one of the first was an advantage or not. ‘I need this job to keep paying the bills and keep everything ticking over, including feeding my two children and getting them new school uniforms.' The scene follows the release of new figures last week showing a record number of people are now in work, as unemployment continues to fall. One hopeful said: 'It is hard for young people like myself to get a job, there just isn't the opportunities out there and people don't want to give you a chance' Following the announcement of the  figures, the Prime Minister tweeted: ‘Another significant fall in unemployment is a sign our long-term economic plan is working, providing security & chances for hard-working people. But it seems the situation in Bridgnorth has not changed since this time last year, when Aldi had a similar response to their job vacancies. Area manager for the supermarket, Leon Donald said: ‘A previous event similar to this attracted around 1,500 people so we knew this event would be well attended.’ The 40 positions available were split between West Midlands’ stores in Dudley, Stourbridge, Halesowen, Brierley Hill, Netherton and Wollaston. There were also positions available in Northamptonshire and Worcestershire. According to the Office for National Statistics, over the past year, unemployment has decreased by -22.40 per cent in Shropshire. But the percentage of people claiming unemployment benefits in the area has remained the same, at 2.1 per cent of the working age population. This is unlike the much of the rest of the country which has seen a fall in the number claimants over the past year.","A line of hopefuls snaked around the store in Bridgnorth, Shropshire .

"By . Lucy Osborne . Debbie Foster already watched one son die in agony from Leigh’s Syndrome – helpless to relieve his pain. So after hearing a second son had the same rare and terminal condition, she found some solace when doctors said a new procedure could relieve his agony. But this small comfort was cruelly taken away when just weeks before Jake, 13, was due to have the operation, NHS bosses refused to pay due to funding cuts. Terminally ill teenager Jake Foster was denied NHS funding for an operation to reduce his pain. But thanks to hundreds of MailOnline readers donating money to his fund, the youngster will be able to have the procedure privately . Jake (pictured with his parents, Debbie and Robert) has a very rare genetic condition called Leigh's Syndrome, which has already killed one of his brothers . Jake has lost most of the movement in his muscles, meaning he is in constant pain and confined to a wheelchair. While the procedure won’t save his life, it could prolong it significantly and at the very least make it a lot more comfortable. Mrs Foster, 45, said: ‘All we want to do is make Jake as happy and pain-free as possible and they’ve taken that from us. ‘It breaks my heart to hear him cry out in pain at night and not be able to do anything about it. There is nothing worse for a mother.’ It is not known how many weeks, months, or years Jake has left to live, but a child with the genetic disorder is only expected to live to the age of around six or seven. The mother of two, who lost her son Robert to the disease at the age of just four on Christmas Eve in 2000, said: ‘It makes me angry that a topless model is allowed to have a boob job on the NHS for cosmetic reasons or someone can have a tummy tuck, but a poorly child has to suffer.’ Jake (pictured as a child with his older brother, James, who has Asperger syndrome) has lost most of his movement as a result of his illness and it causes him extreme pain . ‘If a child is in pain and something can be done about it, how they can be denied treatment?’ Jake’s GP first recommended the procedure, called selective dorsal rhizotomy (SDR), which is often also used to treat children with cerebral palsy. In October last year he was put on a waiting list for the operation at the Queen’s Medical Centre in Nottingham. But they . received a letter in the post in February, weeks before he was due to . have the operation, saying due to NHS funding cuts they could no longer . fund it. Aspring glamour model Josie Cunningham sparked outrage after her NHS-funded boob job - which has since been reversed - on the NHS . As the Mail reported earlier this year, while children such as Jake - and many suffering with cerebral palsy - are being refused funding for life-changing surgery such as a selective dorsal rhizotomy, there is plenty of cash to pay for cosmetic procedures. The case of Josie Cunningham sparked outrage when it emerged she had received breast enlargement on the NHS - and, after tiring of her new assets, a tax-payer funded reduction, too. Ms Cunningham had her 32A breasts enlarged to a 36DD with taxpayers’ money, after saying her flat chest was ‘ruining her life’. Her operation came after she was recommended for funding by her local GP. Under NHS guidelines, cosmetic surgery should be funded only in rare circumstances when it is needed ‘to protect a person’s health’. Then there was the case of morbidly obese Diane Wiggett, who cost the NHS £15,000 by having a gastric band fitted - then having it removed when she decided she preferred being fat. 'We were all excited about it and getting ready for it,’ she said. ‘We . have tried to fight it, tried to re-appeal saying Jake is a special . case but they just said a blanket “no” response. It’s like talking to . robots. ‘The people making these decisions aren’t from a medical background, so there’s no talking to them.’ Mrs Foster and her husband, Robert, 52, who live with Jake and his brother, James, 20, who has Asperger’s Syndrome, have been forced to try and raise the money themselves and have set up a funding page online. ‘We will do whatever it takes,’ she said. The couple have so far raised £3,000 through local fundraising events – a long way from the £9,898 they need for the procedure. Jake, a ‘happy child’ given his circumstances and a Birmingham City Football Club fan, spends his life in a wheelchair and is unable to sit up by himself. The teenager, who is much smaller than most boys his age, has very stiff limbs and one leg is stuck in one position, causing him extreme pain. Jake (pictured with his parents) was offered surgery to reduce his pain by cutting some of the nerves in his back. However, the offer of NHS funding was then withdrawn due to funding cuts . Jake's parents, Debbie and Robert (pictured with their other son, James), are now trying to raise £10,000 to pay for him to have the operation . Very . little is known about the inherited disorder that affects the central . nervous system and there is little by way of treatment. The SDR operation is the only way Jake’s pain can be relieved without the risk of serious side-effects. It works . by cutting the nerves in his back, enabling his limbs to move more . freely and therefore making him a lot more comfortable. Mrs . Foster, who with her husband is a full time carer for her two boys, but . also volunteers to help other parents with disabled children, said: . ‘Because he is in so much pain, he is not sleeping. ‘It’s all about energy and when they get tired, they’re more prone to getting infections and then their health goes downhill. ‘At the moment he has fits most evenings which is very frightening which keeps him awake.’ Mrs Foster (pictured with her husband and sons, Jake and James) says it is unacceptable the NHS will pay for weight loss surgery and for boob jobs but it will not pay for surgery to relieve the suffering of a dying teenager . Mrs Foster (pictured with her husband, Robert) said: 'All we want to do is make Jake as happy and pain-free as possible and they've taken that from us' Leigh's Syndrome is a severe neurological disorder which usually starts to show symptoms during the first year of life. It causes the progressive loss of mental abilities and of movement. It is usually fatal within a couple of years as it causes respiratory failure. Severe muscle and movement problems then develop and these cause loss of feeling in the limbs, weakness and balance problems. Eye, heart and breathing problems are also common in people with Leigh's Syndrome. The . symptoms are caused by patches of damaged tissue that develop in the . brains of patients and these lesions are often accompanied by the loss . of the nerve coatings. This reduces the ability of the nerves to activate the muscles used for movement and to relay sensory information to the brain. The condition occurs in about one in 40,000 babies. The condition is caused by mutations in one of more than 30 different genes. Source: Genetics Home Reference . Jake can only say a few words as the condition also affects the respiratory system. But Mrs Foster said if it wasn’t for his condition, Jake would be ‘a typical 13-year-old’. ‘He’s such a character and very mischievous,’ she said. ‘He . likes the baddies in films. Most kids are frightened of Captain Hook . and Cruella Deville but from a young age he just thought they were . funny.’ There have been several cases this year where poorly children have been refused funding due to cuts. In March two-year-old Sophie Thomlinson who suffers with cerebral palsy was told she couldn’t have an operation that would help her walk. A Daily Mail campaign helped raise the money so she could have the operation. Meanwhile, Around 5,400 gastric bypasses and 1,300 gastric band procedures are performed by the NHS each year and in 2012 it spent £3.5million on 790 breast implant operations. It is estimated Leigh’s Syndrome occurs in one in every 40,000 live births, though certain populations have considerably higher rates.

"By . Lucy Osborne . They look just like any two adoring young sisters. But three-year-old Rosie Mulchinock and five-month-old Daisy have been ‘genetically designed’ in a laboratory to beat an incurable disease that runs in their family. In a first of its kind in the UK, the pair were born from embryos that were screened by scientists to ensure they would not suffer Huntington’s disease. Rosie (left) and Daisy (right) Mulchinock were both 'genetically designed' in a laboratory to ensure they would not develop an incurable disease that runs in their family. They are pictured with their parents Karen and Phillip . Their mother Karen, who has the killer disease herself and has already watched it kill her father, knew that if she were to have children there was a 50 per cent chance of passing it on. But thanks to this new ‘designer’ technique called pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) - where only healthy embryos are inserted back into the womb and unhealthy ones discarded - sisters Rose and Daisy have been born free from the disease. It is believed to be the only case in the UK where two babies in the same family have been born using this method. Mrs Mulchinock, 35, a procurement team retailer, said: ‘It is probably the greatest achievement of my life - giving them a life where they don’t have to face an uncertain future.’ Huntington’s disease is a hereditary disorder of the nervous system which affects the brain, usually when the victims are in early middle age. ‘Knowing that they will never develop this devastating condition is the best feeling in the world. I can’t thank the doctors enough. Scientists were able to select healthy embryos and to implant these into their mother's womb to remove the risk of them having Huntington's disease . ‘This disease stole our father away from us. He was diagnosed with it in his late 50s and we had to watch as his behaviour changed, his balance went and his personality completely changed.’ She added: ‘Knowing that I am going to develop the disease too, like my father did, is difficult and we don’t talk about it much. Preimplantation . genetic diagnosis is available to couples who are at high risk of . having a child with a genetic or chromosome disorder. The aim is to obtain and fertilise some eggs which, when they have developed into embryos, can be tested for the abnormality. Up . to two unaffected, healthy, embryos can then be transferred to the . mother's womb in the hope they will implant and she will become . pregnant. If this is successful, she will have a baby without the condition. Source: Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust . ‘We will have to face it in the future but for now, we just want to concentrate on bringing our family up.’ PGD has caused controversy in recent years, with critics condemning it as ‘meddling with nature’. Many people believe that life begins at conception and the destruction of embryos just because they are not completely healthy is ethically wrong and equates to the destruction of a person. But Mrs Mulchinock, from Derby, believes their motive was justified. She said: ‘Our only other option was if I became pregnant, to have the baby tested at 12 weeks and then make a decision whether to keep it. ‘Or to go ahead without any testing at all and just hope for the best. So we decided we wanted to try PGD instead.’ The couple had one course of treatment at a hospital in London in 2006 which was unsuccessful and then they went to CARE Fertility in Nottingham in November 2009. Mrs Mulchinock underwent a cycle of in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and doctors found that half the embryos had the defective gene. Two were selected which were free from the condition and put back into her womb and the rest discarded or donated to scientists in order to carry out research. Mrs Mulchinock knows that she will develop Huntington's disease and her father died of it so she wanted to ensure that her children were not at risk as well . Two weeks later she found she was pregnant, and the pregnancy went smoothly. Rose was born in August 2010 at the Derby Royal Hospital. The couple then had another attempt two years later, but that was unsuccessful. It was on their third attempt that she managed to conceive again. Huntington's is an incurable disease caused by an inherited faulty gene, which produces a protein called Huntingtin. It's not known how, but the gene causes widespread damage to the nerve cells in the brain, causing a range of symptoms. Sufferers can exhibit emotional and mental changes such as mood swings, clumsiness, lack of motivation, aggression and depression which, in the early stages, can often be written off as simple personality traits. Later, they develop physical problems such as the shakes or nervous tics, then weight loss and muscle weakness which leave the patient unable to swallow, speak or move. Every sufferer has a different rate of deterioration, but it is a fatal condition. Huntington's is estimated to affect around 8,000 people in the UK. In adults the symptoms usually appear between 35 and 50, although until a blood test was introduced around 20 years ago, it was very difficult to diagnose it at an early stage. She said: ‘This time we only had one embryo which was free from the disease, so it really was the only and only chance we had.’ Mrs Mulchinock added: ‘To have done it successfully a second time was the most amazing feeling. ‘We have managed to stop this disease now in our family, as it can’t be passed any further down the line. ‘Now they can live their lives to the full. ‘We can’t thank the doctors enough for giving us the chance of having a healthy family.’ Colleen Lynch, Molecular Geneticist from CARE Fertility said: ‘We are not aware of another case like this in the UK. 'It is extremely rare, and it’s a massive weight off the minds of this family to know that their little girls have been born free from such a terrible disease. ‘It’s a disease that devastates families, and to have eradicated that disease from this family by using this technique is wonderful.’ PGD also has the potential to screen for genetic issues unrelated to medical necessity, such as intelligence and beauty, and against negative traits such as disabilities.","Karen Mulchinock has Huntington's disease and it also killed her father .

"By . Lucy Osborne . Birmingham businesswomen Ranjit Uppelle, 41, left, and Kavita Jnagal, 37, admitted conspiracy to defraud at Southwark Crown Court . They rubbed shoulders with the stars, chatted to the Chancellor and even shook hands with the Queen at Buckingham Palace – all the while being praised for helping people find work. But unknown to those they mingled with, businesswomen Ranjit Uppelle and Kavita Jnagal had been busy masterminding a sophisticated scam which saw them steal £200,000 of taxpayers’ money. The pair co-founded Simply Recruitment in 2008 – a company that claimed to ‘help adult learners improve their job chances’. This led to them being awarded the Outstanding Women in Business of the Year award. They relied on their carefully constructed veneer of respectability as they hobnobbed with the likes of Prince Charles and former Dragons’ Den tycoon James Caan. Their success led to them meeting the Queen at an Asian Women of Achievement reception held at Buckingham Palace, and at other prestigious events they mingled with Gordon Brown, George Osborne and David Cameron. But it has now emerged that the pair’s astonishing rise to success was built on a complex scam which involved taking money from the Government-funded quango, Learndirect. A court heard Uppelle, 41 and Jnagal, 37, recruited an army of ‘ghost students’ to pose as clients in order to acquire large amounts of funding. Investigators believe they claimed the money by charging Learndirect for fraudulent training courses, most of which took place between March and November 2010. The pair used company employees to fake student enrolment and exam result records in adult education packages. Their staff were told to sit the exams and then doctor the results in order to secure funding from the Government. Employees were coerced into forging the signatures of fake students to add extra weight to the fraud. Hundreds of real students are also thought to have been enrolled without their knowledge, and work was faked for students who signed up to courses but later pulled out. Other results were doctored to make it appear that students who failed the tests had actually passed their exams. High life: The two women (Jnagal pictured right) met the Queen at a Buckingham Palace reception . Now fallen from grace: The women also met Prince Charles at a business conference . Meeting the Chancellor: Uppelle, left, and Jnagal met George Osborne through their recruitment work . Uppelle, from Edgbaston in Birmingham and Jnagal, from Rugeley, near Lichfield, both admitted conspiracy to defraud at Southwark Crown Court. They were handed suspended jail terms of nine and six months respectively and ordered to pay £1,000 costs. Uppelle and Jnagal entered their pleas last August, but they can only now be reported after the scam’s ringleader, Sandeep Jethwa, admitted the same charge in January. He swindled at least £120,000 from the charity University for Industry by creating ghost students, – but was caught when the Metropolitan Police’s fraud squad was alerted to concerns over an unusual number of high-level passes in February 2011. Jethwa, 43, from Bishop’s Stortford, Hertfordshire, was jailed for a year and has already had to repay £120,000. Detective Constable Mo Khan said: ‘Instead of helping provide adults with the skills to improve their employability, they devoted time to faking training. Jnagal, left, got a six-month suspended prison sentence and Uppelle a nine-month suspended sentence . Uppelle and Jnagal, pictured with Cherie Blair, were each given suspended jail terms and a £1,000 fine . ‘Their conspiracy undermined the entire project as well undermining their contractual obligation to Learndirect.’ Learndirect spokesman Adrian Beddow said: ‘We are pleased with the outcome of this case. ‘We identified this fraudulent behaviour and undertook a full investigation, working to bring a strong case which led to the guilty pleas of all involved. ‘We do not tolerate behaviour of this kind from our suppliers. These sentences should serve as a warning that the protection of public funds is of paramount importance to us.’ Entrepreneur and television personality James Caan also had his picture taken with the two fraudsters .","Ranjit Uppelle, 41, and Kavita Jnagal, 37, ran Simply Recruitment business .

"By . Lucy Osborne . White Dee is facing a probe into her disability benefits after being pictured cavorting with friends on holiday in Magaluf – while claiming to be too depressed to work. The star of controversial TV Show Benefits Street has admitted to claiming Disability Living Allowance (DLA), which is given to those too unwell to look after themselves day-to-day. But Dee, whose real name is Deirdre Kelly, was pictured energetically downing shots and pints of beers, while playing games with friends on a trip to Magaluf in Majorca last week. Scroll down for video . White Dee is facing a probe into her disability benefits after being pictured cavorting with friends on holiday in Magaluf - while claiming to be too depressed to work . Dee, who starred in the Channel 4 documentary about life on benefits, has been spotted drinking champagne in a luxury hotel in Magaluf this week . The 42-year-old told the TV programme she has been left too depressed to work since her mother died . And while the criteria for being eligible for DLA include needing help cooking a main meal, her agent Barry Tomes last night told the Daily Mail that 42-year-old Dee is currently considering an offer to front a new cookery show. ‘What many people don’t know about Dee is that she is an amazing cook and has been offered her own cookery show,’ he said. Other criteria to claim the DLA include needing ‘help with things like washing, dressing, eating, using the toilet or communicating your needs’. The unemployed mother of two also claims she is too depressed to work. But she is now set to face questions from the Department for Work on Pensions on her eligibility to receive the benefit and whether or not she is fit to work. Under the current benefits regime, the reality TV star is allowed to undertake work and keep claiming DLA, which is a minimum of £21 a week. She was pictured sipping cocktails and lying on sun-loungers in the beach resort . It is now said the single mother-of-two will not face a quiz from benefits officials . And it is not against the rules to go on holiday if you are in receipt of the benefits. But claimants must inform the DWP immediately if their condition changes, and proof that Dee is not in fact depressed could lead to an investigation into her payments. However, Mr Tomes said he has recommended that Dee takes holidays in the sun to help her combat her depression so that she can get back into work. He added that she has had seven offers from production companies in total, including from BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5, as well as three separate record deals, but has had to turn them down because she is ‘too unwell’. Snog: White Dee closes her eyes as she kisses a man at the Carnage Pool Party in Magaluf, Majorca . All smiles: White Dee was then seen holding hands and walking away with the unidentified man in Magaluf . ‘It is like a light switch goes off when you are with her, sometimes she’s fine but then suddenly her whole mood will change and there’s nothing you can do,’ he said of her condition. ‘She could easily earn half a million from one of these, but she doesn’t want to at the moment.’ Mr Tomes added that Dee, who is said to receive £10,000 a year in benefits, is preparing for two other all-expenses paid holidays – with her two children – to France next month, then to mainland Spain in July. Her current trip saw her fly out to Spain on Wednesday last week, where she posed with £500 bottles of champagne and downed copious amounts of alcohol. She was invited on the four-day holiday by another of her agent’s clients, an American singer. Together they attended a pub crawl organised by events firm, Carnage Magaluf. Alan Collinson, who organises the event and was pictured with Dee, is accused of attacking a groom and three members of his stag party, it was revealed last night. It is not known if Dee was on the same bar crawl when the incident took place, but she was at the resort at the time. Enjoying a drink: A man pours White Dee a glass of champagne during the Carnage Pool Party in Magaluf . In the sun: White Dee (centre) from Benefits Street enjoys an ice-cream while on holiday in Majorca . She may be too depressed to work, but that didnt stop White Dee partying hard on holiday in Magaluf . The Benefits Street star was spotted enjoying an all-expenses-paid, mid-week trip to Majorca . The groom, Jordan Carty, was left with a broken jaw. Police in Majorca have launched an investigation . Before the incident, Mr Collinson, 28, said that he didn’t know Dee had depression, adding: ‘She came across as a good laugh. She’s off out tonight with us on a bar crawl. I don’t think she is a big drinker though – she told me she prefers tea and biscuits.’ The DWP said that it would not discuss individual circumstances, but said they would make inquiries if evidence comes forward. It is not known what other benefits Dee claims, but she says she is not on Jobseeker’s Allowance. She revealed she receives benefits of £214 a week, but has since said she would stop claiming the money if she started receiving an income, either because of the show or another job. Although she worked as a barmaid, and was later a Birmingham council administrator, she left in disgrace after being convicted of stealing £13,000. She narrowly avoided jail in 2007 and was ordered to carry out 220 hours of unpaid work. Jonathan Isaby, of the  TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Of course no-one in receipt of DLA should be denied the opportunity to enjoy themselves, but rigorous systems need to be in place to ensure that those receiving taxpayer-funded benefits genuinely require them.’","Comes after she was pictured downing shots and pints on Magaluf holiday .

"By . Lucy Osborne . With a swastika flag and pictures of military aircraft on the walls, this is the bedroom where a neo-Nazi schoolboy plotted a ‘new Columbine massacre’, a jury heard yesterday. Michael Piggin, 18, stockpiled homemade bombs, a terrorist manual and an array of weapons as he planned attacks on targets including his former school and the college where he was studying for his A-levels, the Old Bailey was told. Pictures of his bedroom walls can be published after they were shown to the jury yesterday. Disturbing: The image, shown to jurors at the Old Bailey, shows the bedroom of Michael Piggin, dominated by a Nazi flag, warlike newspaper cuttings and pictures of Batman villain The Joker . A Nazi flag has been put on top of a . world map and there are pictures of military aircraft and weapons. A . poster showing The Joker, the villain from the Batman film The Dark . Knight, is also displayed. Prosecutor Gareth Patterson told the court: ‘This is the scene that confronted officers when they entered the room.’ Accused: Michael Piggin, who is accused of planning a massacre, can be named now that he has turned 18 . Piggin’s unmade bed has a Union Flag duvet and pillowcase and the emblem of the Knights Templar can be seen on the wall. He also has football posters on his walls together with Liverpool FC curtains. Piggin, a supporter of the English Defence League, was arrested in February last year. Although . they are not shown in the photo, the court heard how he used his . bedroom in Loughborough, Leicestershire to stockpile an arsenal of . weapons. They included a crossbow, machete, knives, air guns and pipe bombs and partially-assembled petrol bombs. There . was also a stab-proof vest, gas mask, blank firing pistols, three . ball-bearing guns and an illegal terror manual, Mujahideen Poisons . Handbook. In diaries, which . are covered with swastikas, he wrote ‘hit lists’ of six places he . intended to ‘eliminate’ including the town’s university, council . offices, a mosque and a cinema, and people he wanted to kill such as . Muslims, teachers and school friends. The . court has heard that Piggin, who suffers from Asperger’s syndrome, . described plans for an armed assault on his former school in . Loughborough as ‘the new Columbine’, a reference to the 1999 high school . shooting in Colorado in which 12 pupils and a teacher were killed. Teenager: Piggin, who can be named for the first time after turning 18 in January, stockpiled an arsenal in his bedroom, including pipe bombs, partially assembled petrol bombs and air rifles . He . and two friends nicknamed themselves the Urban Revolutionary Army as . they experimented with making and detonating homemade bombs, the court . heard. They put on . balaclavas for videos of them preparing Molotov cocktails made from wine . bottles and white spirit. Inspiration: Piggin allegedly scrawled 'the new Columbine' in a notebook, referring to the American high school massacre, carried out by pupils Dylan Klebold (pictured) and Eric Harris . Piggin, described by the prosecution as ‘a . would-be terrorist’, also allegedly wrote a message to one of his . friends in December 2012 claiming he hit his mother after fighting the . urge to shoot pre-school children in Loughborough. ‘After picking up my pistol I was walking past a nursery and felt the urge to shoot,’ he wrote. ‘I nearly gave in but I fought it and I hit my mum. We had an argument and she said some real mean stuff and I just flipped.’ Piggin also wanted to shoot Muslims at a mosque in Loughborough, the jury heard. In . a text message he said: ‘When you have got your new air pistol we will . meet up and will both bring pistols and go for a bit of a shooting . session down at the Mosque. 'I’m sick of being the outcast when there are . some scum that enjoy a better life than me.’ Piggin . said he ‘felt sorry’ for Seung-Hui Cho, who shot and killed 32 people . in the Virgina Tech massacre, also in the US, in 2007. Restrictions on reporting  Piggin’s name were lifted after he turned 18 in January. He . and two other 18-year-old boys, who cannot be named for legal reasons, . have already admitted possessing petrol bombs and pipe bombs. Piggin denies possessing a terror manual and articles connected with terrorism. Later . yesterday the jury was discharged after two jurors dropped out because . of personal problems. The trial is due to restart next week. Plans: One of Piggins' alleged targets was Loughborough University . The Old Bailey heard that two of the teenager’s friends, who cannot be named for legal reasons, have pleaded guilty to possessing either petrol bombs or pipe bombs. But Piggin, who has Asperger’s Syndrome, was set apart from his friends and driven by a paranoia of ‘Islamic invasion of Europe’. Prosecutor Max Hill QC told the jury that the teenager’s plot and his haul of weaponry was not ‘child’s play’ but a deadly threat. He said: ‘For an average young man in an average house in Loughborough or any town you care to name in England and Wales, you may think that is startling. ‘That is what this case is about. ‘The final item is a notebook containing information about the planning of attacks and study of explosive devices. He said of the 1999 mass shooting: ‘That’s something that you’ll want to assess in this case given that this defendant, not in Colorado USA but in Loughborough England, was writing ""the new Columbine"" in his notebook. Klebold and Harris, the mass killers in Columbine, were aged 17 and 19 at the time of those atrocities. What you have in this case is a 17-year-old.’ Piggin denies possessing items for terrorism and a terror manual, but admitted possession of petrol and pipe bombs and components of IEDs. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Michael Piggin, 18, 'planned to bomb a school, a mosque and a court'

"By . Lucy Osborne . Claire Duke, 38, pictured leaving Stafford Crown Court in Staffordshire, wept in the dock as she confessed to seven counts of fraud . A 'lifestyle coach’ stole more than £80,000 from  Premier League footballers and other high-profile clients by claiming she was arranging luxury holidays for them. Claire Duke set up a business, Solutions Lifestyle, where she advertised flights and hotels at discount prices for wealthy clients including Stoke City striker Peter Odemwingie. The 38-year-old pocketed payments she received. After believing they had paid her for the whole package for their holiday, her clients and their  families arrived at their arranged destination only to be told their hotel had not been paid for. Among her other victims were Liverpool’s Andre Wisdom and former West Bromwich and Celtic manager Tony Mowbray as well as other unnamed wealthy clients. Yesterday Duke appeared at Stafford Crown Court where she wept in the dock as she confessed to seven counts of fraud. She made £82,561.79 fraudulently from six of her clients between April 2012 and July last year. The court was told Duke stole more than £15,000 from Nigerian striker Odemwingie, 32, after obtaining his bank details from his debit card. She also conned Mowbray – who was managing Middlesbrough at the time – by getting him to pay her more than £30,000 to stay at a luxury hotel in Dubai. When he arrived with his family, he found that a different – less luxurious – hotel had been booked and the bill had not been paid. Duke, who described her role at the business as a lifestyle coach, also pocketed £6,000 from Wisdom, 21 – currently on loan to Derby – after he paid for a trip to Jamaica. She is understood to have known the players she duped on a professional level for some time. Duke stole £15,437from Stoke City striker Peter Odemwingie, 32, left, after obtaining his bank details from his debit card and she pocketed £6,000 from Liverpool defender Wisdom, 21, right, who is currently on loan to Derby County, after he paid for a trip to Jamaica . But it is not known how these relationships came about and what her ‘lifestyle coaching’ entailed. Duke, from St Albans, Hertfordshire, also swindled money former Middlesbrough FC manager Tony Mowbray . Hugh . O’Brien-Quinn, prosecuting, said Mr Odemwingie had paid her £7,000 so . she could book him flights to Miami. He added: ‘He paid with his debit . card. He married his fiancee in May 2012 and his future parents in law paid £7,560 to book a honeymoon. ‘The . defendant pocketed that money but needed to cover her tracks and book a . honeymoon. So in April 2012 she used Mr Odem-wingie’s debit card . details and paid £7,471.12 from that account to another company who . arranged the honeymoon. She received £1,000 commission and even handed over the tickets at the wedding reception. She then used Mr Odemwingie’s card again for return flights from Eindhoven to London for a football agent  priced at £325.33.’ Mr . O’Brien-Quinn added: ‘On April 10, Andre Wisdom, a player for Liverpool . FC paid £6,600 to the defendant for a flight to Jamaica. That money has . disappeared. ‘Again she . needed to cover her tracks and used Mr Odemwingie’s account to do so, . paying £15,160.44 for flights and hotels for Mr Wisdom’s holiday to . Jamaica.’ Duke was arrested in February last year but continued to  offend on bail. She was yesterday given a two-year suspended prison sentence. Recorder . David Mason QC said he was not sending her to jail due to the effect it . would have on her two children. ‘I hope that my decision is the right . one,’ he added. Outside court, Duke said: ‘I am deeply sorry for all the upset and the stress that I caused.’ Duke, pictured leaving Stafford Crown Court today, swindled the money by setting up a business called Solutions Lifestyle where she advertised flights and hotels at discount prices for her wealthy clients - but pocketed the money for herself . Duke, 38, cried in the dock and thanked the judge as she was spared jail. She was handed a two year prison sentence, suspended for two years, and ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work . Duke, right, today apologised to Peter Odemwingie after she stole from him while he was a player at West Bromwich Albion, left.

"By . Lucy Osborne . An A-level pupil expected to achieve top grades at Margaret Thatcher’s old school was killed on her way to class when her friend drove into a lorry. Emily Challen, 17, died almost instantly when the car she was in ploughed into the back of the stationary HGV at 40mph. Driver Aimee Culpin failed to see it because she had been looking over her right shoulder at the traffic, a court heard yesterday. Miss Challen – who was head of her house at Kesteven and  Grantham Girls’ School – was in the front passenger seat when she died just four days before her 18th birthday on February 15 last year. Tragedy: Emily Challen, 17, (left) died almost instantly when the car she being driven by Aimee Culpin, 19, (right) ploughed into the back of the stationary HGV at 40mph on the A1 in Lincolnshire . The crash happened on a slip road off the A1 less than a mile from her family home in the village of Long Bennington, Lincolnshire.  Culpin, 19, broke down in tears yesterday as she admitted causing death by careless driving. District Judge John Stobart sentenced her to 200 hours of unpaid work and a 12-month community order. She was also banned from driving for 18 months and must pay £150 costs. Judge Stobart said: ‘This is a dreadful case. It is tragic, it is awful. ‘Every person that sits in front of me today has been changed by it, and for the worse. It was a momentary lapse of judgment which could happen to any of us.’ Lincoln magistrates’ court heard that Culpin, who had passed her driving test just eight months earlier, had not been distracted by anything in her Vauxhall Corsa but had simply failed to spot the HGV. Talented: Miss Challen - who was head of her house at Kesteven and  Grantham Girls¿ School (pictured) - was in the front passenger seat when she died just four days before her 18th birthday on February 15 last year . David Beal, prosecuting, said: ‘She told police she put on speed and was travelling at 40mph, accelerating towards the A1. She was looking over her right shoulder. She failed to see the broken down articulated lorry in the nearside lane. ‘She drove into the rear of it. The impact was immense. The roof was taken clear off the Corsa. Emily was killed almost instantly.’ Miss Challen, who had a younger brother and sister, was studying business studies, art and English  literature at the grammar school, where Lady Thatcher was head girl in 1943. She died at the scene. Her mother and father, Keith and Jennifer Challen, had planned to take her to the hit London musical Mamma Mia! for her 18th birthday.Mrs Challen was at home getting the couple’s 11-year-old son James ready for school when she received a phone call informing her of the accident. She drove straight to the scene. Emotional: The judge at Lincoln Magistrates' said the case was 'awful' and tragic' In a victim impact statement, she said: ‘When I got there I saw in the distance a large lorry with Aimee’s car embedded in the back of it. ‘When I reached the car Emily was still in it. The corner of the lorry was sitting on top of where Emily had been. It was a horror scene. ‘My daughter lying there with barely a pulse is something that will haunt me forever. 'Every person that sits in front of me . today has been changed by it, and for the worse. It was a momentary . lapse of judgment which could happen to any of us' Judge Stobart at Lincoln Magsitrates' ‘I could not and still cannot understand how Aimee could have got her car into this position, causing the death of my daughter. ‘Emily was my best friend and a soulmate. The family has been devastated. The death of Emily has left a massive hole in our lives.’ Culpin was taken to hospital with an arm injury. Two other girls in the back of the car were not seriously injured and the 52-year-old lorry driver was unhurt. Sunil Khanna, mitigating, told the court: ‘What happened here was a tragic set of circumstances. She has thought again and again about what she could have done differently and how she did not see that lorry.’ Following the crash, Miss Challen’s headmaster Graham Burks said: ‘Emily was one of our house captains, an iconic figure the girls admired and aspired to be like. ‘She was very bright, very kind, a true leader among our students, a truly beautiful young person. We were all immensely proud of her. She was greatly loved throughout the school community.’ After the hearing, solicitor Michael Pace said on behalf of the Challen family: ‘Emily impressed everyone she met and she will not be forgotten by all those who had the pleasure of knowing her. ‘Any sentence will never reflect the circumstances of an event like this.’ Culpin declined to comment.","Emily Challen, 17, died almost instantly after the crash on the A1 .
