"Multi-millionaire Philip Shirley is by many measures the most impeccably bred landowner in the country . A few miles outside Stratford-upon-Avon, on the banks of the river Stour in the heart of Shakespeare country, sits a spectacular neo-Gothic mansion called Ettington Park. In 40 acres of parkland and filled with suits of armour, oil paintings and a selection of resident ghosts, the stately home is the family seat of 58-year-old Philip Shirley. You probably haven't heard of Mr Shirley, a tall, somewhat shy accountant with a wife and four children, who inherited a large tranche of Warwickshire on the death of his father, Major John, in 2009. This unassuming multi-millionaire is by many measures the most impeccably bred landowner in the country. A cousin by marriage to David Cameron, he is almost the only person in England whose can trace his lineage back to the Domesday Book by uninterrupted male descent. Shirley's paternal ancestors have managed to hold land continuously in the 'manor' where Ettington Hall stands for almost a thousand years. So evocative is the family history that William Shakespeare, an occasional house-guest at Ettington Park, wrote gushingly about 'the spirit of valiant Shirley'. Today, some 400 years later, talk of that 'valiant' spirit brings a wry smile to the lips of local people. For Philip Shirley finds himself at the centre of a very public skirmish. It revolves around some six acres of farmland that he owns on the edge of Ettington, a couple of miles from the family seat. This site — a field crossed by a well-trodden footpath, with views of the Cotswold Hills — is the subject of a fierce planning dispute. Shirley, in partnership with a building company, plans to develop it to create several dozen 'executive' homes. Ill-feeling over the proposal has united the local community in opposition. More than 400 people — one for every house in Ettington — have filed written objections to it. Many see it as emblematic of a wider national malaise. For as the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) revealed this week, a staggering 729,000 homes are to be built on greenfield sites such as this. Almost 200,000 of those will be on supposedly protected Green Belt land. The front view of Ettington Park, which sits on the banks of the river Stour in the heart of Shakespeare country . The battle has not just divided the village but caused tensions among the members of Shirley's immediate family. Indeed, I understand that his wife, Augusta, is vehemently opposed to the development. The trouble here began last year, when Philip Shirley struck a multi-million-pound deal to allow a developer, Charles Church Homes, to build 80 homes on the field, which has been in his family for generations. Locals, when they found out in September, were outraged by the project, which would increase the size of the pretty village, which has two pubs and one shop, by a fifth. They held angry public meetings, signed petitions, met politicians. After a planning application was submitted last month, they began bombarding Stratford-upon-Avon's district council with complaints. The village is dominated by banners and signs opposing the proposed estate, claiming that it will increase traffic, destroy a well-used footpath and place an intolerable strain on the local school. 'It's the scale that is so outrageous,' says Sally Rawles, the leader of SHAPE, a lobby group with 200 local members opposing the development. 'Stratford council have said our village should have no more than 50 new homes between now and 2031. 'This will give us 80 in one go, in a highly visible spot. It will rip the heart out of our community. It just makes my blood boil.' Much personal anger is directed at Philip Shirley himself. 'We never thought the Shirleys would do something like this,' says Mary-Ann Warmington, 56, whose grandmother, a parlourmaid, was one of many locals who worked at Ettington Park. Ettington residents against the proposed development in the village. Sally Rawles, left, Louise Whiteley and Simon Pipe are pictured in the foreground . 'They have always run the village so we never thought they would do something to ruin it, especially when they already have so much money. I feel betrayed.' Hostilities nearly spilled over at the White Horse pub last month when SHAPE held a quiz night to raise funds to oppose the development. Augusta Shirley had agreed to attend the event as a guest of James Holloway, a local agent for the Conservative Party. However, a few hours before it began she was advised not to attend due to the 'level of hostility' her presence might generate. An organiser tells me: 'It was for her own safety. People are really livid.' I understand that Mr Shirley has not actually sold the field yet, but instead granted Charles Church Homes a legally binding 'option' to buy it, for several million pounds, provided planning permission is granted. But details of the deal are hard to ascertain. When a local newspaper got wind of it, Mr Shirley not only refused to comment but even refused to confirm that he owned the field. Land Registry documents confirm that it belongs to a family trust based in the Isle of Man for tax purposes. He did not respond to the Mail's requests for comment. 'A lot of this is about class,' said a source close to the family. 'People always want to blame the landowner, but new homes have to go somewhere and half of these villagers who so oppose the development live on an estate built 15 years ago. That makes them hypocrites as well as NIMBYs. 'If they owned a field and were offered a chance to turn it into a few million quid, I bet they'd accept.' When I called at the farmhouse where the Shirley family live (these days they lease Ettington Park to a luxury hotel chain), Augusta also declined to discuss the affair. The area's Tory MP, Nadhim Zahawi, who backs the project's opponents . However, a friend of Mrs Shirley told me that her sympathies lie with the villagers. She was said to be 'very cross' about her husband's decision and 'feels passionately' that planning permission should be refused. 'Philip signed this silly deal without telling Augusta. He's a greedy clot for doing it and she is very, very cross about it,' said the friend. Sir William Stratford Dugdale, Mr Shirley's uncle, is a wealthy businessman married to David Cameron's aunt Cecilia, although friends deny that the landowner has a close relationship with the PM. 'I believe two branches of the family fell out years ago when Philip, or one of his close relatives, wasn't invited to David Cameron's fifth birthday party. Petty though it seems, they've barely spoken since. Some extended family members now won't vote Conservative,' says one. As regards the planning battle, though, similar disputes are playing out across rural Britain thanks to the housing boom, a loophole in planning regulations and the incompetence of more than half of our local authorities. In at least eight villages around Stratford-upon-Avon, developments of between 20 and 100 homes are mooted. Locals are calling it 'a battle for Shakespeare country'. Some of the building applications go back to 2010, when the Government altered planning law to require every local authority to create a 'core strategy' outlining where an allotted number of new homes should be built in the coming years. It was decreed that, if no such plan was in place, home-builders who were refused planning permission for a project but appealed against that decision to central government would be likely to gain automatic consent. The rule was supposed to encourage local government bureaucrats to create housing plans promptly. But three years after it came into operation, 178 of the country's 327 district councils still haven't managed to complete their 'core strategy' — temporarily giving developers carte blanche to build on almost any rural land they can buy. As the CPRE revealed this week, 38 major developments, involving 8,700 new homes, were given the green light on appeal last year. Most were in the constituencies of Tory MPs, leading some to wonder if anger over the issue could cost the party marginal seats at next year's election. 'There are lots of Tory landowners benefiting from this planning loophole,' says Sally Rawles. 'They all have connections to the party and many of them are donors.' Which is awkward for the area's Tory MP, Nadhim Zahawi, who backs the project's opponents. The other day Mr Zahawi, a No 10 policy adviser, published an open letter to the Government calling for the loophole to be closed. It declared that the 'physical harm' being done by 'rapacious developers' threatens 'to become the defining legacy of this Government'. He had a point. For the longer the loophole remains open, the angrier the voters of Ettington, and many other villages, will surely get.","Philip Shirley finds himself at the centre of a very public skirmish .

"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge won a landmark legal case yesterday blocking further publication of topless photographs of Kate. Judges banned French magazine Closer from selling or republishing the pictures and said its decision to use them had been a ‘brutal’ invasion of the couple’s privacy. However, the injunction was branded a ‘hollow victory’ because more than 500,000 copies of the magazine have already been sold, about 100,000 more then normal. Click here for latest video . Thrilled: The giggling Royal couple will be over the moon as they end their Jubilee tour as their lawyers won a landmark injunction in a Parisian court today . And there were fears that the ruling . would do little to halt the worldwide spread of the pictures because the . magazine does not own the copyright. A freelance photographer based in . France is understood to have taken the ‘particularly intrusive’ pictures . and sold them to Closer. He or she is thought to own the copyright. The French judicial system has so far been unable to discover the name of the photographer. As a result, no injunction banning . him from selling the pictures in France or around the world can be put . in place. This means that although William and Kate have won their . hearing, they have been unable to ban any future sales. Historic: The publication of the topless photos prompted the Royal couple to sue over their privacy for the first time - securing a ruling, pictured, preventing further distribution of the images . Triggering the storm: French magazine Closer . (left) was the first to publish the naked pictures of the Duchess. Now . Aurelien Hammelle (right), the French lawyer,  has successfully challenged them in court . King and Queen for the day: William and Kate are carried on their royal duties during a visit to Funafuti in Tuvalu shortly after the images were published . Friendly welcome: William and Kate are carried from their private jet in Tuvalu, where thousands greeted them on the small cluster of islands . Battle: Tacky Italian magazine Chi was the latest to publish the topless pictures of Kate - owned by the same company as French Closer . Privacy row: The Tribunal de Grande Instance (above) in Nanterre, on the outskirts of Paris, has heard representations from the royals as they begin legal action against the publishers of French Closer magazine . How it was done: The photographer who took the controversial pictures most likely took them from this spot on a Provence road overlooking the chateau . Dream home: The Royal couple relaxed and had fun at Chateau D'Autet, pictured, not knowing they were being spied on . eBay has removed copies of French Closer containing naked photos of the Duchess of Cambridge. Upset members have been contacting management demanding they are pulled down. 'Following strong feedback from the eBay community, we will be removing these items, and are already in the process of doing so,' an Ebay spokesman said. Copies of French Closer magazine featuring topless photos of the Duchess of Cambridge were doing a roaring trade on the UK version of the online auction site. Some users had been selling the magazine, which is otherwise not available to buy in the UK, since it first hit the shelves last week. Multiple listings for the magazine were live on the site, with one offering a 'buy it now' price of £35 with the seller 'huni-pie' leaving a note reading: 'Closer magazine in french bought back from Paris today has photos of the royals topless.' Another copy attracted 12 bids before it sold for £31.01. Twitter users have also been using the networking site to distribute copies among themselves. User @kasabianite tweeted four days ago: 'If any of my followers are in France id appreciate it if they’d go to the shop & buy a copy of closer magazine, i’ll dm my address.' The judges said the magazine’s use of the photos was a ‘brutal exhibition’ of the couple’s intimacy. Last night a French legal source told . the Mail: ‘This ruling is all about stopping Closer from publishing . more pictures. Although it is an important legal step for William and . Kate, it doesn’t stop more pictures from being published because we . can’t find the photographer. To some extent it’s a hollow victory. ‘However, a French judge would . certainly take a dim view of any French paper or magazine which decided . to print the pictures after this ruling.’ In a written judgment handed down at . the Tribunal de Grand Instance in Nanterre, a suburb of Paris, judges . agreed that the couple ‘could legitimately suppose’ the chateau they . were staying in ‘was sheltered from prying eyes’. Closer magazine was also ordered to . hand over all files containing the intimate images to representatives of . the couple within 24 hours. Mondadori Magazines France, the . glossy magazine’s publisher, faces a fine of £8,000 for every day it . refuses to hand over the pictures. The company was also ordered to pay . £1,600 in court costs. Such sums are meagre given the huge success of . the latest edition of Closer, which features the pictures of a topless . Kate. Closer will be fined £80,000 if it . sells the pictures to another publication, the judgment states. Publication of the photos, taken in Provence on September 5, was also . banned ‘on digital tablets’. Royal lawyers did not ask for any remaining . copies of the magazine to be removed from newsagents because ‘the . damage has already been done’. Last night a royal source said William and Kate were delighted with the decision. ‘They welcome the injunction that’s . been granted,’ the source said. ‘They always believed the law was broken . and that they were entitled to their privacy.’ The Duke and Duchess have also filed a . criminal complaint under France’s privacy laws. If Closer is found . guilty it could be fined up to £36,000 and its editor could, in theory . at least, serve up to a year in prison. However, publications in France often . flout privacy laws because they know that fines are small and prison . sentences rarely handed out. On Monday their lawyer Aurelien . Hamelle told the court that the photos revealed ‘particularly simple and . deeply intimate moments in the life of this couple that have no reason . to be on a magazine cover’. He went on to say that the Duchess is ‘a . young woman, not an object’. William and Kate are prepared to devote years to legal battles pursuing those responsible for the topless pictures – or those who publish them. Sources close to the couple confirmed they were under no illusions  about the length of time it could take for their fight to make its way through the Paris courts. But they insist that the Duke and Duchess will press ahead because they feel so strongly about the invasion of their privacy. This morning, the couple’s complaint against French Closer magazine – the first to publish the images – is to be heard at the Tribunal de Grande Instance in the Paris suburb of Nanterre. They have instructed Paris barrister Aurelien Hammelle to call for ‘the stiffest punishment possible’ against the magazine. St James’s Palace said there were plans to press for criminal charges against the photographer – who has so far remained unidentified. The Duke and Duchess are also considering action against the Irish edition of the Daily Star, which printed the pictures on Saturday. Showbiz roundup!

"Carry On film legend Leslie Phillips is in hospital after he had a stroke during a shopping trip to London's Oxford Street. The 90-year-old actor was taken ill on Saturday and is now in a 'stable' condition at a top London clinic, where he is expected to spend at least a month. His wife Zara said his millions of fans would want to support  the film legend, who featured in more than 150 movies including the Carry On series where he was famous for lecherous catchphrases such as 'ding dong' and 'hellooo!'. Scroll down for video . Much-loved: Carry On film legend Leslie Phillips (left in the 1970s) is in hospital after he had a stroke during a shopping trip to London's Oxford Street. His wife Zara (with him right) said he was in a stable condition . Respected: The actor continued working recently and voiced the Sorting Hat of the Harry Potter films . His wife, who is in her mid-50s and married the star nine months ago, was with him when he was taken ill on a bus as it reached their home in Maida Vale, west London. 'Leslie suddenly started leaning on me and was unable to put a ticket in his coat pocket,' she said. 'He had terrible pains in his left arm so I stopped the bus and called an ambulance which took him to University College Hospital in Euston. 'He kept saying to me ""don’t cause a fuss"", but I knew he was unwell and needed urgent medical help. 'From there, he was then transferred to a top neurosurgery hospital in the capital.'

The celebrated comic actor played PC Tom Potter in Carry On Constable with Shirley Eaton (left) Larking about: The actor sliding down the banister in 1983 at his home in Maida Vale, west London . The father-of-four is undergoing medical tests and his wife said she hoped he would soon return home. 'Leslie is very strong and I’m sure he will pull through,' she added. 'I love him to bits and I know his millions of fans will want to wish him well for the future.' The veteran star embarked on his third marriage in December last year, telling reporters with a roguish smile: 'I thought I’d better get on with my life and marry Zara'. His Turkish-born wife had been a constant companion since the 2011 suicide of the actor's  second wife, the former Bond girl Angela Scoular. The Tottenham-born film legend was still working before the stroke, voicing the Sorting Hat of the Harry Potter films and acting in several British TV dramas including the Ruth Rendell Mysteries, Revolver and Agatha Christie's Marple. He was born on April 20, 1924, into a working class family and made his first film appearances as a child in the 1930s. Screen legend: Phillips was made a CBE by the Queen in 2008 for services to drama and is now 90 years old . Honours: The actor was born in Tottenham and received the Freedom of the City of London in 2010 . He is believed to be the only actor still alive who performed at Pinewood Studios in its first week after opening in 1936. During the Second World War, he was commissioned in 1943 as a Second Lieutenant in the Royal Artillery, and transferred to the Durham Light Infantry in 1944. But he later left after being declared unfit for service with a neurological condition that caused partial paralysis. Phillips returned to the stage and screen and became a household name as a star in the Carry On films and the Doctor comedy series in the 1960s onwards. He was a  friend of the late Robin Gibb of the Bee Gees and the late actor Peter O'Toole, and recently helped fund the memorial to the Bomber Command in Green Park. His trademark rounded vowels came after his mother sent him to stage school to lose his Cockney accent - but he has never lost sight of his roots and has often been paraded around White Hart Lane as a celebrity football fan. He was made an OBE in  1998 and a CBE in 2008 for services to drama.","Star was taken ill on Saturday during a trip to London's Oxford Street .

"Theo Walcott made his long-awaited return from the knee injury that kept him out for nine months and wrecked his World Cup dream as Arsenal’s Under 21s were held by Blackburn. The England star played 45 minutes of the match at Boreham Wood, easing himself back into competitive action after only returning to full training on Monday. When Walcott was taken off on a stretcher in Arsenal’s FA Cup third round derby with Tottenham on January 4, nobody could have known it would be October 17, under the Friday night lights at modest Meadow Park, before we saw him again. Theo Walcott returned to action for Arsenal for the first time since injuring his knee in the FA Cup third round . Despite ten months out of the team the Arsenal and England star showed flashes of his best football . Arsenal: Ryan Huddart, Tafari Moore, Stefan O’Connor, Semi Ajayi, Brandon Ormonde-Ottewill, Abou Diaby (c) (Chiori Johnson 67), Ainsley Maitland-Niles, Theo Walcott (Alex Iwobi 46), Serge Gnabry (Gedion Zelalem 60), Daniel Crowley, Chuba Akpom . Subs not used: Glen Kamara, Matt Macey . Booked: Maitland-Niles . Blackburn Rovers: Ryan Crump, David Carson, Kellen Daly, Sam Lavelle, Jack Doyle, Connor Mahoney, Darragh Lenihan, Hyuga Tanner (Sam Joel 85), Devarn Green (Modou Cham 60), Bradley Bauress (c), Dean Rittenberg (Jordan Preston 80) Subs not used: Callum Williams, Paulo Jorge . Referee: Neil Hair . 286 days have been lost from the 25-year-old’s career. 286 days of waiting for the knee ligaments to regain their strength to the point where he could accelerate away from defenders so stylishly once again. Missing the World Cup would have hurt, as would being absent from Arsenal’s FA Cup triumph at Wembley in May and Walcott will desperately want to make up the lost time now he has returned. He said: ‘It’s just nice to get out there and do what I enjoy doing. I’ve really missed it and I’ve just wanted to get back fit. I’m pleased with tonight. ‘It’s important to recover well, you need to be patient. The manager will choose to play me when he wants, it’s not something that will happen overnight.’ Admitting that the nine-month absence was the hardest time in his career, Walcott vowed to come back stronger. He added: ‘It’s been a good opportunity to work on something I've never worked on before, my leg strength. That period I was at academy I missed out on, that development stage in the gym. You work hard with the physios, I've managed to build myself and be stronger and fitter.’ This was a gentle reintroduction - there were a few tantalising glimpses of that trademark pace as he skipped away from the Blackburn defenders. There were also a few inaccurate passes and under-hit crosses as he tries to rediscover that sharpness, but that’s to be expected. With Arsene Wenger in the midst of a debilitating injury crisis, Walcott’s return to the competitive arena will be most welcome. Walcott waits in the tunnel ahead of his Arsenal return against Blackburn at Boreham Wood . Walcott made a few mistakes but Arsene Wenger will be encouraged by his winger's return . Walcott posted to Instagram thanking Arsenal fans and medical staff for sticking by him for the nine months . 3 mins Walcott’s first burst forward with the ball, down the right, takes him past two defenders. A square pass to Serge Gnabry, whose shot from the edge of the box is blocked. 6 Pass through the middle by Gnabry but Walcott is a little slow off the mark and doesn’t make the ball. 10 Tries a little flick to try and break past Jack Doyle but the Blackburn defender reads his intentions and clears. 13 Set free down the right by Daniel Crowley tucked pass but low cross is cut out . 20 Shoots wide from the edge of the box after some eye-catching build-up work from Abou Diaby and Daniel Crowley . 26 Fleet-footed spin and drives through two defenders’ challenges before Darragh Lenihan hacks it clear. 43 Sets Tafari Moore down the right and then almost takes in the clearance. Can’t control the fast-moving ball . 45 Walcott is withdrawn at half-time and replaced by Alex Iwobi . The Arsenal boss is without Mesut Ozil, Olivier Giroud, Aaron Ramsey and Yaya Sanogo for Saturday’s visit of Hull City. Every day seems to bring fresh injury headaches. So there is a chance he’ll be in the squad for Wednesday’s Champions League trip to Anderlecht but, on this evidence, he perhaps needs a few more minutes under his belt before his first-team introduction. The first-half was a terrible spectacle, so it was a good job Walcott was in action to excite the larger-than-usual crowd for this Under 21 Premier League match. Arsenal, who started the match fourth in the standings, were favourites and they made most of the running - often very quickly, with Chuba Akpom and Serge Gnabry causing problems with their speed. Walcott’s first involvement saw him glide down the right and find Gnabry, only for the German’s snapshot to be blocked. Gnabry, himself returning from injury, then curled a 20-yard free-kick over the perimeter fence. Akpom, in excellent form this season and on target for England’s Under 19s in recent European qualifiers, showed a fine turn of pace to ping in a cross that was cut out. German winger Serge Gnabry was also returning from injury and managed an hour for the Gunners . Walcott's injury, sustained against Tottenham in January, saw him miss last summer's World Cup . Walcott did see a chance come his way, after 20 minutes following good link-up play involving Abou Diaby and Daniel Crowley, but he snatched at the shot. Rovers did carry a threat at time, with the winger Connor Mahoney particularly dangerous. But it was the other flanker, Devarn Green whose dinked ball just eluded captain Bradley Bauress when clean through. Eight minutes before half-time, Arsenal keeper Ryan Huddart saved low from Darragh Lenihan as the visitors enjoyed their best spell. Walcott managed one shot that went inches wide on his return to football against Blackburn U21s . Injury-prone midfielder Abou Diaby continued his latest comeback with another U21s appearance . The second period was even more tepid. Ryan Crump preserved Blackburn’s lead when he slid out to thwart Ainsley Maitland-Niles with about 20 minutes to play, before Akpom’s goal was disallowed for offside. Suddenly, Arsenal stepped things up - Alex Iwobi, who had replaced Walcott, back-heeled into the path of Crowley, whose powerful hit was beaten away by Crump at his near post. They went even closer when Crowley’s free-kick was tipped on to the crossbar in the last 10 minutes but this one ended in stalemate. But at least Arsenal fans have a favourite back again.

"Five hundred not out as captain and John Terry celebrated with a new hairdo – slab of longer hair on the top and extra-short everywhere else - and a win at Crystal Palace which should erase some of the pain of his last visit. At Selhurst Park in March, Terry scored the only goal of the game in the wrong net and Jose Mourinho conceded defeat in the title challenge and criticised his team for lacking 'balls'. This trip across the capital was far more enjoyable for Chelsea as wonderful goals from Oscar and Cesc Fabregas set them up for a 2-1 win which extends their unbeaten start to the campaign as captain JT passed his impressive milestone, nearly 13 years after he first led the team out against Charlton, in December 2001. After the game he posted a picture on his Instagram account of a bottle of Sassicaia and two glasses with the message: 'Today was my 500th game as Chelsea Captain, I had the pleasure of playing and learning from the best with Dennis Wise and Marcel Desailly two heroes and great captains who always had time for me as a young boy.

Fans: Terry is never a popular figure with the opposing supporters. Terry's name was jeered when the teams were announced before kick-off, and booed off the pitch at the end by home fans who chose to disregard his goal-scoring efforts here in March. He was jeered also when escaping a yellow card for chopping down Fraizer Campbell on the half-way line in the first-half to halt a quick Palace break. The Chelsea fans got behind him, as ever, and he made a long walk across the pitch to salute them after the final whistle, once he had changed into a yellow shirt with a '500 Thank You' message scrawled across the front with a marker pen.

Terry is pictured arriving at Selhurst Park (left) and applauding Chelsea supporters (right) Defending: Strong, assured and under-employed for long spells. Crystal Palace threatened early on, almost entirely on the counter-attack. There were one or two early alarms, although these surrounded his central defensive partner Gary Cahill more than Terry. The skipper's biggest problem came when he was entangled in the netting, having scrambled back to cover as Campbell sidled past Cahill and lobbed Thibaut Courtois, only for the effort drop over. There was a miscued back-pass, in the second half that required Courtois to be alert, which he was. Once Fabregas had made it 2-0, Chelsea coasted in and Terry was unruffled, operating almost at walking pace until the late scare prompted by Campbell's goal. On the goal, he was unable to get close to cover Filipe Luis as Wilfried Zaha skipped inside from the right, but he couldn't really be blamed.

He went close with a header from a corner swung across by Fabregas in the first half, when Chelsea were 1-0 up. It was cleared off the line by James McArthur.

"FA Cup minnows Warrington Town got a pep talk from their most famous former player - 1966 World Cup winner Roger Hunt - as they received a plum home draw against League Two Exeter City in Monday night's first round draw. Hunt, who played for the club between 1955 and 1958 before signing for Liverpool, turned up at Warrington's Cantilever Park ground to watch the draw with the current players who have made history by reaching the first round for the first time in their 65-year history. Roger Hunt (centre) joins Warrington players to watch Monday's FA Cup first round draw . Warrington, who play in the eighth tier of English football, are managed by Shaun Reid, brother of former Everton and England star Peter. Hunt played for the club when they were known as Stockton Heath - they changed their name in 1961 to reflect the whole of the town. Warrington manager Shaun Reid (front left) was pleased with FA Cup draw . Now 76, he said: 'Although I went on to win things with Liverpool under Bill Shankly and England, I've never forgotten where it all started for me. 'I am so proud to see them in the FA Cup first round, we didn't manage it when I played for them! There was a great atmosphere when the draw was made and I've told the lads they've got to go out and enjoy it. There is nothing to be afraid of.' Hunt still lives in Warrington and has been known to turn up on occasions to watch their games.

"Not since Elton John rocked up has Shrewsbury Town’s Greenhous Meadow stadium been braced for such packed stands. The visit of Chelsea has seen an extra 486 temporary seats installed, thanks to financial assistance from sponsors Capital One, to push the expected attendance over the five-figure mark, double the usual. There were 16,000 scattering on to the pitch when Sir Elton played in 2011. It is an exciting evening ahead for the people of this Shropshire town but not many believe their League Two team will still be standing after Jose Mourinho’s Premier League leaders are done. Shrewsbury duo Andy Mangan and Mickey Demetriou pose with the Capital One Cup at Greenhous Meadow . The League Two side have been able to install 486 temporary seats for home fans ahead of hosting Chelsea . The numbers tell much of the story. Shrewsbury’s annual wage bill is understood to be £1.4million, more than 125 times smaller than their visitors’, which stands at £176m. Eden Hazard’s new £200,000-a-week contract would see him earn as much in seven days as manager Micky Mellon’s entire squad in two months. But after claiming the scalps of Blackpool, Leicester, and Norwich already in this competition, Shrewsbury want more. ‘We aren’t here to clap people on to the pitch,’ says Mellon, holding court in a neat suite of the ground opened in July 2007. ‘We’re going to try and knock them out. We know the task is massive but we want to reach the quarter-finals.’ Mellon, the 42-year-old hailing from Paisley, was part of the Blackpool side which stunned Chelsea in September 1996, winning 3-1 in the League Cup at Stamford Bridge but going out on aggregate. ‘In every game of football, you always have a chance,’ he adds. ‘Of course, it’s ridiculous how much bigger their chance is. But while we’re still in the game, we’ll keep believing. There are certain areas of the pitch that have to be absolutely on the money.’ Shrewsbury boss Micky Mellon holds the Capital One Cup before taking on Premier League leaders Chelsea . Andy Mangan and Mickey Demetriou sit in a temporary stand that will accommodate home fans on Tuesday . How many of Mourinho’s stars will turn out remains to be seen, especially given it will be only 48 hours since the match at Old Trafford, but seasoned internationals should still flood their line-up. The Shrewsbury players they face will have cost next to nothing. Striker James Collins, signed for a nominal fee from Hibernian this summer, is the only one not brought in on a free. Liam Lawrence, recently recovered from injury, is the most recognisable name. The 32-year-old former Stoke and Sunderland midfielder joined because Mellon likes to play his football on the floor and the facilities are above the norm for League Two. Chelsea should be pleased at the standards that await on and off the pitch. The manager has knitted together a squad with 16 new faces by insisting on breakfasts together in pre-season and ensuring every player speaks their mind. ‘We need leaders in our team,’ he says. The Capital One Cup trophy was at the stadium on Monday and caught the eye of local schoolchildren at the training ground earlier in the afternoon. ‘They all came sprinting over, touching it, kissing it,’ adds Mellon, hoping this can provide a catalyst. ‘The spotlight being on us will be great to keep moving us forward.’ Shrewsbury manager Micky Mellon shows off the Capital One Cup trophy to school children on Monday . Didier Drogba celebrates his goal at Old Trafford on Sunday with Chelsea team-mates Gary Cahill and Willian . Shrewsbury's Ashley Vincent and Scott Vernon served drinks and signed autographs for those queuing for tickets to the Chelsea match . If Chelsea are ahead, is there a chance Mourinho offers an early handshake? ‘I’d be disappointed if he never shook my hand,’ says Mellon. ‘I’d see that as a bigger sign of disrespect. It may upset Roy Keane but it doesn’t bother me. If we’re winning maybe I’ll give him a big cuddle.’ Asked to suggest his own title given he will face The Special One, Mellon quips: ‘The Special Brew.’ That is in reference to a new ale made by a local brewery specially for the match: Wood’s Blue & Amber. Mellon warmly greets fan Lloyd Burton, an 11-year-old cancer sufferer who is in a wheelchair after arduous treatment on his brain tumour. Lloyd has worked on a paint-by-numbers portrait of Mourinho and will meet the Chelsea manager before the match so he can sign the picture. Decked out in Shrewsbury kit and bobble hat, Lloyd will be cheering on his team, alongside 10,000 others eager for an upset.","Shrewsbury host Chelsea in the Capital One Cup on Tuesday .

"Levski Sofia fans have accused bitter city rivals CSKA's coach Stoycho Mladenov of feigning unconsciousness when he was hit in the head by a snowball during an explosive derby played in a blizzard on Saturday. In the early stages of the tense affair, Mladenov collapsed on to the athletics track surrounding the pitch after being hit by the snowball thrown by Levski supporters, forcing the referee to halt the game for several minutes. After the match, won 3-0 by league leaders CSKA, Mladenov said he lost consciousness and called for the football authorities to expel Levski from the top division. CSKA Sofia coach Stoycho Mladenov (circled) is down in the snow after being hit on the head by a snowball . CSKA Sofia's derby with Levski was played during a blizzard and snowballs were thrown on to the pitch . CSKA Sofia coach Stoycho Mladenov was hit in the head by a snowball during the derby . However, Levski fans, who were lambasted in local media following the ugly incident, said Mladenov had conducted a theatrical tumble. 'Children play with snowballs the whole winter but I haven't heard of anyone who has collapsed,' Vladimir Vladimirov, the head of Levski's national fan club, told local media on Monday. 'It was disgusting to watch, his over-acting was so poor.' Mladenov said on Monday that he had a medical document, proving his injury, and would present it to the Bulgarian Football Union (BFU) if they requested it. 'They (Levski fans) began to throw snowballs at us from the start of the game,' CSKA's assistant coach Anatoli Nankov said. 'We informed the fourth official but he said that their behaviour was normal.' Levski, 26-times Bulgarian champions and one of the country's two most popular clubs along with CSKA, have a history of fan violence and racism at their matches, leading to a number of stadium bans and heavy fines in recent years. Earlier this month, Levski were fined 19,000 levs (£7,700) after fans mocked one of the anti-racism campaigns launched by European governing body UEFA in a Bulgarian league match. Last October, Levski fans burst into coach Ivaylo Petev's news conference shortly after the start of his unveiling presentation and made him take off the club's shirt before showing him the exit because they believed he supported CSKA. Levski fans caused more trouble after CSKA's third goal on Saturday when they broke through fences surrounding the pitch and reached the running track, forcing more than a 100 policemen to prevent them from making their way to the playing surface. 'It was a spontaneous act,' Vladimirov said. 'Believe me, if we wanted to invade the pitch, no one could've stopped us.' The BFU's disciplinary committee will discuss the snowball incident on Tuesday. CSKA and Levski are bitter rivals and there is often trouble when the two sides meet each other .","Levski Sofia fans threw snowballs on to pitch during derby with CSKA .

"A former NFL offensive lineman who played for six teams before opting for a quiet family life in Georgia has died suddenly aged just 46. Scott Adams died on Monday in Oconee County near Athens but the cause of his death has not been disclosed. Photographs taken in recent weeks and uploaded to Facebook show Adams swimming and grinning as he spent time with his family - with no sign anything was amiss. He leaves behind his wife, Tishara, and their three-year-old daughter, Dyllan. On his Facebook page, the proud father lavishes praise on his blonde-haired toddler. Loss: Scott Adams is pictured playing for the Minnesota Vikings in 1992. He died suddenly on Monday aged 46 . Adams was born in Lake City, Florida and played football for the University of Georgia from between 1985 and 1988. He was a second-team All-Southeastern Conference selection in 1988 and was named an All-America honorable mention by The Associated Press. Adams played six seasons in the NFL. He began his career as an offensive guard with Minnesota in 1992 and started a career-high nine games in 1993 with the Vikings. Adams also played for New Orleans, Chicago, Tampa Bay and Atlanta before finishing with the Atlanta Falcons in 1997. He played a total of 58 games for the NFL. Family: After leaving the Falcons in 1997, he married wife Tishara. They had a daughter, Dyllan, now three . Talent: After moving to back to Athens, GA - where he attended college - he worked as a mortgage banker . After retiring from the game, he began working in mortgage banking, eventually launching his own company, Adams Group/Cornerstone Home Lending, in Athens, Georgia in 2007. He also married wife Tishara Jespersen, who gave birth to their daughter Dyllan in April 2010. A former classmate and friend, Atlanta Journal-Constitution sports writer Chip Towers, paid tribute to the ex-NFL player in a column in the newspaper on Monday. 'Scott Adams died Monday in Oconee County,' he wrote. 'It was sudden and unexpected. He would have turned 47 on Sept. 28th, the day Georgia plays host to LSU. He would have been at the game.' He said he always remembered Adams with 'a big grin on his face, always moving from one endeavor to another, no matter how difficult and challenging'. He pointed out that Adams career had not been without those challenges. Proud: Photographs on Facebook show Adams grinning as he holds his young daughter, Dyllan . Active: Photographs taken in recent weeks show Adams apparently happy and healthy . 'He didn't get drafted,' Towers pointed out. 'He fought for roster spots and played on practice squads. But when it was all said and done, he played nearly 10 years in the NFL with six different teams.' He noted that although they were not close, he would see the family heading to church on Sunday morning and would always remember Adams for his grit. Tim Worley, an All-American tailback in 1988, also paid tribute to the ex-footballer - remembering his friend as 'a man of God' and 'one of the most talkative linemen I've ever played with'. 'Scott Adams was a versatile warrior,' he said. 'He could play any position on the offensive line... 'Scott was also just an awesome human being that people loved to be around. He was full of life, full of energy, always revved up in the huddle and whenever you saw him, you were ready to play.' Georgia said funeral arrangements have not yet been finalized.","Offensive lineman Scott Adams played for six NFL teams including the Vikings and the Falcons after successful college career at Georgia .

"A company marketing guns to children as 'My First Rifle' has removed its website after a five-year-old boy shot dead his two-year-old sister while playing with one of the weapons. The boy fired a single-shot gun called a Crickett, which is made by Keystone Sporting Arms, and which was given to the youngster last year as a gift. He fatally shot his sister, Caroline Sparks, in the chest only minutes after her mother says she stepped outside their home in . Burkesville, Kentucky on Tuesday. The website, which was not accessible on Thursday, showed children of all ages firing the mini rifles, which come in a variety of colors, including blue and pink. Scroll down for video . Worst nightmare: Authorities say Caroline's older brother, pictured with her here, fired the single shot from his .22-caliber rifle called a Cricket, fatally shooting her in the chest . Keystone Sporting Arms produced 60,000 Crickett and . Chipmunk rifles in 2008, according to the website.  It also makes guns . for adults, but most of its products are geared toward children. The company's slogan is 'my first . rifle' and its website has a 'Kids Corner' section where pictures of . boys and girls are displayed, most of them showing the children at . shooting ranges and on hunts. The . shooting highlights a cultural divide in the gun debate. While many . suburban and urban areas work to keep guns out of the hands of children, . it's not uncommon for youths in rural areas to own guns for target . practice and hunting. Controversial: The crickett.com website carries the slogan 'My First Rifle' and sells a range of weapons . Popular: The website has a 'Kids Corner' where pictures of young boys and girls are displayed, most of them . shown at shooting ranges and on bird and deer hunts. The website has now been removed . 'Down in Kentucky where we're from, . you know, guns are passed down from generation to generation,' Cumberland County Coroner Gary White told the Lexington Herald-Leader. 'You start . at a young age with guns for hunting and everything.' What is more unusual than a child having a gun, he said, is 'that a kid would get shot with it.' 'The goal of KSA is to instill gun . safety in the minds of youth shooters and encourage them to gain the . knowledge and respect that hunting and shooting activities require and . deserve,' the site said. The company said that the site was experiencing difficulties because it was inundated with traffic following the little girl's death. Attorney John Renzulli, who spoke on behalf of the company, told Mother Jones that they were working to get the site running again, but could not specify a time. Renzulli added that it was not the time to discuss gun control. Loss: The family said they did not know the gun still had a round left inside, which killed little Caroline . Killed: Caroline's mourning family said they are dealing with the tragedy by turning to their faith . 'This is not about Crickett . Firearms,' he said. 'We need to respect the privacy of these people, . this family is going through a lot. We're not going to analyze and . evaluate what happened here until a full investigation has been . conducted by law enforcement. At that point we'll comment.' The coroner said the gun was kept in a corner and the family didn't realize a shell was left inside it. It's 'just one of those crazy accidents,' White said. The gun was given to the 5-year-old as a gift last year, . 'It was god's will. It was her time to go, I guess,' Caroline's grandmother, Linda Riddle, told Lex18. 'I just know she's in heaven right now and I know she's in good hands with the lord.' In . a brief news release, state police said the shooting occurred when the . boy was 'playing' with the rifle, but did not elaborate. It is not clear whether any charges will be filed, said Kentucky State Police spokesman Trooper Billy Gregory. Weapon: The 5-year-old boy shot dead his sister with a Crickett .22 caliber rifle (like the one pictured) that he was given a year ago .

"A California Highway Patrol officer suspected of stealing nude and racy photos from the cellphones of women arrested on drunken driving charges sent the pictures to at least two fellow officers in what he called a game, according to court documents. Officer Sean Harrington, 35, confessed to investigators that he sent such photos at least six times over several years to colleagues in Dublin, but learned to do it while working in Los Angeles, the Contra Costa Times reported Friday. Harrington has worked for the CHP for five years, and the newspaper reports that he is assigned to administrative duties pending the investigation. Played a game: A California Highway Patrol officer is off the streets as he faces accusations of stealing nude pictures from a DUI suspect's phone and sending them to to own device in what he called a 'game' Contra Costa County prosecutors say they expect to announce if they will file criminal charges in the coming days. Officers Robert Hazelwood and Dion Simmons are named in an Oct. 14 search warrant affidavit, suspected of receiving the photos and exchanging banter with Harrington. Attempts by The Associated Press to reach the three men on Saturday were unsuccessful. CHP Commissioner Joe Farrow said in a statement that his agency has launched an investigation, citing a similar case several years ago involving two officers in Los Angeles. 'The allegations anger and disgust me,' Farrow said. 'We expect the highest level of integrity and moral strength from everyone in the California Highway Patrol.' The investigation was sparked by a 23-year-old San Ramon woman arrested Aug. 29 on suspicion of drunken driving, who had a blood alcohol content of .29, more than three times the legal limit. Court papers say that she later discovered nude photos of herself had been sent from her phone to an unfamiliar number. Drunken driving charges against the woman have been dismissed in light of the investigation of Harrington, the newspaper reported. Distraught: The victim's attorney has said the 23-year-old  victim is traumatized from the invasion of privacy . The affidavit says Harrington also sent Hazelwood photos of a 19-year-old woman arrested following a suspected drunken driving crash in Livermore on Aug. 7. The photos show her wearing a bikini, and Hazelwood responded in a text asking if there were any nude photos, court papers say. Harrington sent those photos next to Simmons, who replied favorably, saying 'Nice,' according to the affidavit, and Harrington asked his colleague to return the favor, 'down the road buddy.' Darryl Holcombe, a senior investigator with the Contra Costa District Attorney's Office, said in the affidavit that the behavior amounts to felony computer theft. Attorney Rick Madsen, who represents the 23-year-old woman, said the officers' communications were 'dehumanizing' and 'horribly offensive' to his client and all women, saying, 'It's going to lead to another level of mistrust and skepticism to the motive of law enforcement in general.'","Officer Sean Harrington, 35, confessed to investigators that he sent nude photos at least six times to hi colleagues in Dublin as part of a game .

"Harry Redknapp has sought an end to his spat with Adel Taarabt, claiming the Moroccan forward has a future at the club, as long as he sorts out his act. Taarabt missed out as QPR beat Aston Villa 2-0 in their Premier League clash at Loftus Road. A Charlie Austin brace earned Harry Redknapp's side their second league victory of the campaign. But while Redknapp and Taarabt have had a very public confrontation over the last week, Redknapp claimed there is still a place for the former Tottenham man in the side. The Queens Park Rangers bench celebrate after Charlie Austin scores his second goal of the evening . The former Burnley striker scored two brilliant goals to hand QPR a much-needed victory at Loftus Road . 'He (Taarabt) can still play a part in the future if he gets himself fit,' Redknapp told Sky. 'All I ask people to do every day is come in, train, be thankful for being a professional footballer and work hard. 'God gave him a fantastic talent I just hope he doesn't waste it. If he's fit and ready to play, he's a great talent. 'He's working hard this week, he's working with the fitness coaches and we've got a game tomorrow for the reserves (at home to Swansea) and him and one or two of the lads will get a game. That's all I want him to do - get himself fit to run like the boys tonight.' The win goes a long way to ease the pressure on Redknapp, who continues to face questions about his future, and he felt that the victory was richly deserved. Adel Taarabt claimed Redknapp rarely bothered attending training in response to his manager's comments . Taarabt shows off his physique to Sportsmail photographer Andy Hooper in response to Redknapp's insults . 'It was an excellent performance, I thought we did ever so well,' he said. 'They started to get a bit of the ball in the second half and dominate the possession but I felt when we changed it and we tightened up in the middle then suddenly we started getting hold of the ball and I thought we dominated then. 'We had a couple of great chances, we hit the post with Junior's (Hoilett) shot, then it would have been a great goal for (Eduardo) Vargas with great passing movement so overall I thought we well deserved the win.' Redknapp was understandably full of praise for match-winner Austin and believes the former Burnley man can be a prolific marksman in the Premier League. 'Two great finishes for Charlie,' he added.

"A massive raid earlier today in California turned up a staggering $65 million in cash. Federal agents descended upon dozens of businesses in the downtown Los Angeles Fashion District Wednesday morning as part of an investigation into suspected money laundering done for Mexican drug cartels. Among the cash seized was $140,000 in ransom paid by relatives and friends of a U.S. citizen who was kidnapped, beaten, shot, electrocuted and waterboarded while being held captive by a Mexican cartel. Scroll down for video . Historic haul: Feds seized $65 million in cash during a raid of 80 L.A. businesses earlier this morning that were suspected of laundering money for Mexican cartels . Black market exchange: The businesses were all located in L.A.'s Fashion District, and thought to be aiding in the Black Market Peso Exchange . In addition to the money, nine people were arrested as 1,000 officers with the DEA, ICE, IRS and FBI descended on approximately 80 businesses. 'We have targeted money-laundering activities in the Fashion District based on a wealth of information that numerous businesses there are engaged in Black Market Peso Exchange schemes,' assistant U.S. attorney Robert E. Dugdale said in a statement. 'Los Angeles has become the epicenter of narco-dollar money laundering with couriers regularly bringing duffel bags and suitcases full of cash to many businesses.' Kidnapping and torture: Some of the money seized was the ransom paid for an American man who had been shot and waterboarded by the Sinola caertel . The Black Market Peso Exchange is a complicated system in which businesses help to launder drug money for international cartels. Brokers in Mexico will find a business that wants to buy goods from the United States, and have a drug dealer in the United States who wants to convert their U.S. dollars to Mexican pesos purchase those goods for the Mexican business using their U.S. dollars. Then, once the Mexican business sells all those purchased goods in Mexico, which had been paid for by the drug dealer in the U.S. with dollars, they hand over the pesos to the broker, thereby converting the dealer's U.S. dollars into Mexican pesos without ever physically moving any cash. The most harrowing news to come out of the raid was the revelation that one business, Q.T. Fashion Inc., a maternity apparel wholesaler, accepted $140,000 cash and then sent sent clothes to a retail business in Culiacan, Mexico,according to the Los Angeles Times. That money had been for the release of an American drug distributor who was kidnapped and tortured by the Sinaloa cartel after U.S. agents intercepted a shipment of 100 kilograms of cocaine he was responsible for selling. The man had been shot, beaten, electrocuted and waterboarded on a ranch in Mexico. His friends and family members were the ones who brought the money to the business . Arrests were also made at three other businesses, Yili Underwear, Gayima Underwear and Pacific Eurotex Corp., accused of laundering money.","A  raid in downtown Los Angeles this morning turned up $65 million in cash .

"Serena Williams bounced back from her embarrassing loss to Simona Halep by beating Eugenie Bouchard in comprehensive fashion at the WTA Finals. The world number one suffered her worst defeat for 16 years in Singapore on Wednesday, winning just two games. It was the two-time defending champion's first loss in 17 matches at the end-of-season event and left her relying on other results going her way to reach the semi-finals. Serena Williams bounced back from her defeat to Simona Halep by beating Eugenie Bouchard 6-1 6-1 . She did her bit, needing only 57 minutes to see off Bouchard 6-1 6-1, a result that also ensured Halep became the first woman to qualify for the last four. Halep needed Bouchard to win only one game, and the 20-year-old Canadian fought back from 0-40 to hold serve in the opener. But from there it was a miserable afternoon for Bouchard, who came into the tournament under-prepared because of a thigh problem and has lost all her round-robin matches in straight sets. But despite the victory, Williams is relying on other results to see her progress to the semi-finals . The final match in the red group comes on Friday between Halep and Ana Ivanovic, with a straight-sets win for the Serb enough to put her through to the semi-finals and eliminate Williams. In the white group, Caroline Wozniacki made it two wins out of two by defeating Agnieszka Radwanska 7-5 6-3. It was a high-quality match but Wozniacki, who had battled for more than three hours to see off Maria Sharapova in her opening clash, was the stronger in the end. In the white group, Caroline Wozniacki won her second straight game, this time beating Agnieszka Radwanska . The Dane, who is the lowest-ranked player at the event, said on the tournament website: 'I knew from the start this wasn't going to be an easy match, it was going to be a match with a lot of long rallies and some incredible shot-making. 'I came out there and was a little bit nervous and a few times early on I was thinking, ""Aga, how did you make that ball?""' Wozniacki is still not assured of a spot in the last four because Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova defeated Sharapova 6-3 6-2 in the other match, meaning all four women can still qualify. It was Kvitova's first victory over Sharapova in six attempts, a run dating back three years.","Serena Williams beat Eugenie Bouchard 6-1 6-1 at WTA Finals .

"Tragic: Missing mother Sarai Sierra was found stabbed to death in Istanbul. The body of a missing New York City woman has been discovered in a hardscrabble neighborhood of Istanbul next to ancient city walls covered with graffiti that she so loved, according to her husband. Sarai Sierra, a 33-year-old mother of . two, went missing while vacationing alone in Istanbul. She was last . heard from on Jan. 21, the day she was due back home. The Anadolu Agency says residents discovered the body of a woman near the ancient city walls in a low-income district. Police later identified the body as Sierra, through her driver license. Officers have detained for questioning nine men and two women in connection to the murder. Anadolu said Sierra was found with a head wound and a blanket near her body. She was wearing jeans, a jumper and a jacket, and still had her earrings and a bracelet. In its report, the private NTV news channel said Sierra was stabbed to death. Steven Sierra, the victim's husband, told CNN.com that his wife was fascinated by graffiti, which may have been her undoing. Tags were evident on the crime scene photos from the site where her body was discovered in the low-income district of Sarayburnu Saturday. Police believe that the photographer may have been killed elsewhere and then dumped next to the ancient ruins. However, even it that was the case, it does not exclude the possibility that the 33-year-old woman had met her assailant earlier near the walls. Crime scene: Police forensics search for missing New York City woman Sarai Sierra near the remnants of some ancient city walls in low-income district of Sarayburnu in Istanbul . Violent death: Reports say the woman was stabbed in the head, but her killer left behind her earning and bracelet . However, Mr Sierra said that it is possible that his wife, who at one time traveled to Amsterdam to capture street art there, was drawn to the graffiti next to her last known tourist destination in Istanbul, the Galata Bridge. CBS News reported that shortly after Sierra's body was discovered, a woman came forward and told police she had seen a white car parked near the city walls as she was driving there the night of Jan. 29, Anadolu reported. The eyewitness said a man was trying to remove 'something' from the car, at which point she caught a glimpse of a woman's hand. A family friend told the New York Daily News Sierra’s parents are devastated, and her boys, ages nine and 11 — have not been told about what happened to their mother. The news comes after police in Istanbul detained and released a man who was one of the last in contact with the missing mother, who vanished the same day she planned to meet up with him. The man only identified as 'Taylan' on . social media sites was taken into police custody after questioning on . the disappearance of the woman, who went missing while vacationing alone . in Istanbul. Theory: Police say Sierra may have been murdered somewhere else and her body was then dumped by the ancient walls . Street art: Sierra's husband said his wife had always been interested in graffiti, and it is possibly that she came to the walls to take pictures of the tags . Sierra was last heard from on Jan. 21, the day she was to start her journey back home to Staten Island as well as the day she planned to meet up with 'Taylan,' according to their online communications. A police official refused to identify him or provide further details on the arrest. He spoke on condition of anonymity in line with government rules that bar civil servants from speaking to reporters without authorization. Sierra is said to have made a call on her phone using Skype on January 30, and have activated it once more again on Thursday. Police say four more Turkish citizens are sought . for questioning by police after also communicating with her through . various social media sites. Turkish news reports said Sierra had arranged to meet her contact, 'Taylan,' on Galata Bridge she wanted to photograph the day she went missing. Previous reports claimed the planned to meet on the 20th. No trace: Sarai Sierra, 33, set off for Istanbul on January 7 and was last heard from on January 21 . It was about a mile from Sierra's hostel, Dogan news agency reported but it's not known if the meeting had actually taken place.

Staten Island Rep. Michael Grimm confirmed to Staten Island Live that police in Turkey were searching for her online contact but he did not know their relationship or if they had met.

"Andy Murray opened his Valencia Open challenge with a 6-3 6-3 win over Jurgen Melzer, although his performance failed to inspire in the Spanish city. In a match littered with poor serves and unforced errors, the third seed, who won the title here in 2009, just about held the edge to progress through to a second-round meeting with Italy's Fabio Fognini. Murray is playing in his fifth consecutive tournament, having won in Vienna last weekend, and is looking to secure his place at the ATP World Tour Finals next month, but will have to improve significantly if he is to better the result of rival David Ferrer, who is the top seed in Spain and aiming to bump the Scot from his current eighth place in the Race to London. Andy Murray defeated Jurgen Melzer to move a step closer to securing his ATP World Tour Finals spot . Murray keeps his eye on the ball as he looks to return a shot from Austria's Melzer . 7. Tomas Berdych (CZE) - 4,105 . 8. Andy Murray (GBR) - 3,885 . ------------- . 9. Milos Raonic (CAN) - 3,795 . 10. David Ferrer (ESP) - 3,775 . 11. Grigor Dimitrov (BUL) - 3,555 . *Standings on Wednesday October 22 . Murray, who came into the contest with a 6-0 head-to-head record against the Austrian, looked settled in the early stages and was a break up in just the third game when Melzer put a weak forehand into the net. However, his serve then went off the boil and a double fault from the Scot gave his Austrian opponent an immediate break back, although Melzer's wide return in game five again put Murray in the driving seat. Murray battled once more to hold his next service game but this time the outcome was more favourable as the third seed took a 4-2 lead. And although the world No 10 continued to perform below par, the occasional flash of brilliance - coupled with an ill-timed and costly double fault from Melzer - saw the Scot secure the opening set in 41 minutes. It was Melzer who drew first blood in the second set, breaking in the opening game with a tidy forehand across the court. Murray was far from at his best against Melzer but managed to beat the Austrian in straight sets . Murray currently occupies the last Race to London but faces competition from Spain's David Ferrer . It was not a match for tennis purists, with too many unforced errors and ugly shots from both sides of the net, and it was no surprise when Murray broke straight back after Melzer fired wide. An upturn in form then looked on the cards when Murray won his next two service games to love, and his fortunes improved further in game six when he fought back from 0-40 to break once more. Melzer's temper spilled over and the world number 121 smashed his racquet frame in frustration, earning a warning from the umpire. Yet the Briton could not hold on to his advantage, and another poor forehand found the net to leave the set back on serve. The topsy-turvy nature of things continued as a lazy, under-hit shot from Melzer gifted his opponent one more break and left Murray serving for the match. And although he did it the hard way, saving two break points, the Brit eventually emerged the winner thanks to another error from Melzer.","The Scotsman won in straight sets against Austria's Jurgen Melzer .

"As many as 142,000 people have been struck down with norovirus, the so-called ‘winter vomiting bug’, over the summer months, official figures show. Outbreaks led to 17 hospital ward closures in August, many of which were in areas popular with tourists such as the South West and Yorkshire. In July and August there were 493 laboratory-confirmed cases, compared to an average of 324, Public Health England said. Scroll down for video . As many as 142,000 people may have been struck down with the winter vomiting bug in August (file pic) But experts estimate that for every confirmed case there were a further 288 unconfirmed incidences, meaning that there could have been about 142,000 cases across England during the summer holidays. The latest data for the last week of August suggests that cases are rising fast, although experts said they could subside of their own accord. Norovirus, is the most common stomach bug in the UK and is highly contagious. It can affect people of all ages and causes vomiting and diarrhoea. There's no specific cure for norovirus but is usually mild and shouldn't last more than a couple of days.

"Real Madrid's dream of turning Zinedine Zidane into their very own version of Pep Guardiola is currently in ruins with the French legend's team rooted to the foot of Spain's third division B. The sight of the immaculately suited-and-booted midfield legend sat in the dug-out next to Carlo Ancelotti last season or pacing the touchline with the Madrid B team this campaign have raised expectations that he could follow the same kind of route as the former Barcelona boss. Like Guardiola, Zidane had been a playing legend for the club, and now, like Guardiola, he is starting out coaching the club's kids but so far all has not gone according to plan. Zinedine Zidane is currently managing Real Madrid Castilla, who are bottom of Segunda Division B . The Real Madrid legend may also be facing a 6-month ban for working without the correct licence . Castilla, as Real's second string are known, are currently on three points at the foot of the table, having lost five of their opening six fixtures. The poor start to the season comes at a bad time for the club's homegrown players amid plans to streamline the youth set-up, scrapping Real Madrid's C team, and the prospect that Zidane could also be banned from coaching for six months if found guilty of managing Castilla without the correct licence. Spain's national association of coaches, CENAFE, made a complaint about the former World Cup winner at the start of the season and now the country's Competitions Committee is studying the possibility that Real have broken rule 104 of their code which could lead to a ban of between four and 16 games (or one to six months). The Frenchman spent last season working as Carlo Ancelotti's assistant as they won the Champions League . Many at the club had expected Zidane to take over from Ancelotti at some point, but that now looks unlikely . Head coaches in Spain need to have a level three national coaching diploma and Zidane is still to obtain the relevant qualification. The president of CENAFE Miguel Galan, who made the original complaint, said: 'Real Madrid is one of the most recognisable sporting institutions in the world and a symbol of this sport but they have to follow the same rules as everyone else otherwise the competition is not fair.' With the prospect of a ban hanging over him, Zidane must try to drag Castilla away from the bottom of the table. The club relies on its B side to produce players for the first team but that cannot happen if it is competing in the fourth tier of Spanish football. Like MailOnline Sport's Facebook page.

"Graeme Swann was forced to defend himself on Wednesday after his decision to quit last winter’s disastrous Ashes tour was described as ‘criminal’ by former England batting coach Graham Gooch. The now retired spinner was accused by the Essex great of having made the touring party ‘a laughing stock’ by abruptly retiring after the third Test on the way to a 5-0 series defeat. Swann suggested that Gooch, who he described as being ‘very old school’ was perhaps not in possession of the full facts about his departure. Graeme Swann will swap a cover drive for a driving seat to take part in the 2014 Wales GB Rally . Swann announced his retirement during a press conference in Australia in December 2013 . The intervention by one of England’s finest opening batsmen means the controversy from Kevin Pietersen’s autobiography has spilled over into a second week. ‘I never spoke to Goochy about it. I’m surprised, I thought he would have talked to me,’ said Swann at an appearance to promote his participation as a driver in next month’s Wales Rally GB. ‘I said at the time I don’t think it’s right and proper to carry on when you are a hindrance to the team. Some people think differently, they think you should just carry on regardless but I don’t and I never will. I am sure I will speak to Goochy at some point. ‘I think he’s a bit misinformed, thinking that I left because of form. Unfortunately I had an injury which meant I couldn’t turn a cricket ball any more.’ The off-spinner admitted that he should never have gone on Ashes tour to Australia in the first place . Swann admitted that he should never have gone to Australia in the first place. ‘In retrospect, I should never have gone on the tour at all. If I have any regrets at all, after The Oval I should have read the signs. But I thought, ‘‘I’ll be fine, Jimmy will take 30 wickets, I’ll only have to hold one end up, and we’ll win a fourth Ashes on the trot’’.’ Swann was reluctant to get into more accusations over what Pietersen has alleged, saying: ‘It’s all about selling books. In a few weeks’ time when all the inevitable interviews are over, nobody will give a monkey’s.’ Graham Gooch described Swann's decision to quit last winter’s disastrous Ashes tour as ‘criminal’ BT Sport presenter and ambassador, the former England cricketer Graeme Swann, will embark on an exciting new challenge to drive at Wales Rally GB (13 – 16 November) which will be filmed by BT Sport for an exclusive documentary to be aired this Autumn.

"Former New Zealand captain Chris Cairns appeared in court on Thursday charged with perjury linked to a libel action he brought in the UK in 2012. Cairns won £90,000 in damages after he sued Lalit Modi, founder of the Indian Premier League (IPL), over an accusation of match-fixing made on Twitter in January 2010. But the 44-year-old was accused of perjury and faced London's Southwark Crown Court on Thursday. Former New Zealand all-rounder Chris Cairns arrives at Southwark Crown Court on Thursday . Cairns, of Herne Bay, Auckland, appeared in the glass-fronted dock alongside barrister Andrew Fitch-Holland, who faces one count of perverting the course of justice. Fitch-Holland, 49, of Saffron Walden, Essex, is described on his chambers' website as ""lead adviser to former NZ captain Chris Cairns in his libel action against former IPL head Lalit Modi"". The pair, both dressed in smart navy blue suits and blue ties, spoke only to confirm their names. Judge Alistair McCreath gave the pair unconditional bail to appear for a plea and case management hearing at the same court on January 16 next year. Both men have indicated they will contest the allegations. Cairns celebrates as New Zealand clinch a 2-1 Test series victory at the Oval in 1999 . The trial is expected to last around four weeks and is expected to begin on October 5 next year - during the ""cricket desert"" when there are few fixtures in the sport's calendar. Cricketers from around the world are expected to give evidence in the case. After learning he would be charged, Cairns said in a statement that he had ""nothing to hide"" and he would do ""whatever it takes"" to prove his innocence. He said: 'I'm obviously extremely disappointed. However, at least there will now be an opportunity to face my accusers in an open forum, with some rigour and proper process around that, so that I can clear my name once and for all.' Cairns - who played his last international in 2006 - fields off his own bowling in an ODI against India in 2000 . A statement from the Crown Prosecution Service released on September 25 said: 'We can confirm that we have authorised police to charge Chris Cairns with one count of perjury, which arises from a libel trial held in the UK in March 2012. 'We have also authorised police to charge Andrew Fitch-Holland with one count of perverting the course of justice, which arises from actions taken relating to the same trial.' In 2007 and 2008, Cairns captained the Chandigarh Lions in three competitions in the Indian Cricket League (ICL), which flourished briefly before the ascendancy of the IPL. The allegation made by Mr Modi related to the second and third of these competitions, between March and April 2008 and October and November that year. Cairns is charged with making a false statement in judicial proceedings. Cairns walks in to court on Thursday on the first day of his case . Specifically, it is alleged that between October 1, 2010 and March 31, 2012, having been sworn as a witness in judicial proceedings, he made a statement which he knew to be false or did not believe to be true, namely that he had never cheated at cricket and nor would he contemplate doing such a thing. Fitch-Holland is charged with committing an act or series of acts with intent to pervert the course of public justice; namely, asking former New Zealand player Lou Vincent to provide a false witness statement in connection with proceedings relating to the libel action between Cairns and Mr Modi in the High Court, which had a tendency to pervert the course of public justice.

"Graham Gooch has questioned why there has been limited reaction from the current England set-up in the wake of Kevin Pietersen's controversial claims in his autobiography. Pietersen's book, released last week, sent shockwaves through the cricket world, with the 34-year-old criticising an alleged 'bullying' culture led by the bowlers within the England dressing room. While several former professionals have commented on the allegations, - including former spinner Graeme Swann, who, Pietersen claims, was among the ringleaders - only England captain Alastair Cook and seamer James Anderson among the current number have spoken out in defence of the team. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Pietersen calls ECB report 'an embarrassment' Graham Gooch pictured speaking in Australia last year during his time as England's batting coach . And Gooch, England's leading Test run-scorer of all-time and the team's batting coach from 2009 until earlier this year, believes those still playing for the side should be allowed their right of reply - even if they have been warned by the hierarchy to keep quiet. 'I believe Alastair and others should get on the front foot a bit more,' he said in an interview with the Daily Telegraph. 'When you and your system are challenged you need to fight back, this sentiment is always expressed in team meetings, never take a backward step have the courage of your convictions. Stand up and stand tall for your country. Kevin Pietersen poses with his new autobiography during a book signing in Canary Wharf last week . 'The players may have been told to maintain silence but if I was still part of that dressing room I would want to have my say irrespective of any media strategy from the suits.' Gooch has become the latest person to question Pietersen's version of events and launched a staunch defence of former coach Andy Flower, who was described by Pietersen as 'sour' and 'dour'. 'I call Andy England's anchor,' said Gooch. 'As head coach he created a calm and committed atmosphere in the England dressing room. 'He had great determination to prepare for every format of the game. He always looked to promote attacking ideas to win matches. He brought a new belief to players following a period of turmoil - at least that's what I noticed during my involvement as batting coach. Gooch (right) standing alongside Pietersen (third left) and Andy Flower (second left) at Lord's in May 2013 . 'When I heard this word bullying well, I'd never heard this word used before in the England dressing-room. There are always disagreements within teams and things said in the heat of the moment. But the way it has been portrayed is not my recollection of the atmosphere within the team.' Pietersen was also scathing of Matt Prior, with an entire chapter dedicated to the wicketkeeper-batsman. But Gooch added: 'Matt Prior is nothing but a team man and nothing but positive. I considered him the glue of the side and a brilliant batsman who could adapt his game to suit any situation. 'He was also a world-class wicketkeeper, one of several world-class players we've had over the past few years' VIDEO Pietersen calls ECB report 'an embarrassment'","Graham Gooch has questioned the limited reaction from the England set-up .

"A frozen fountain dyed red to support hopes for a Chiefs playoff win ended up just looking like an arctic murder scene on Friday. Kansas City officials eager for their home team's first trip to the Super Bowl since 1970 experimented this year at the Northland fountain, known for its beautiful winter ice mounds. Unfortunately for Chiefs fans, the startling result also preceded a spectacular loss to the Indianapolis Colts on Saturday and kicked off a round of stinging ridicule by national media and hometown fans alike. Startling: City officials dyed the Northland fountain in an attempt to show team spirit for their hometown Chiefs but ended up with something grisly . 'This is the first time we have attempted to dye a frozen fountain. #ChiefsKingdom,” wrote the Kansas City, Missouri Parks and Recreation Department on its Facebook page. And as Facebook user Mark Frazier responded, '""Attempt"" is the key word.' Photos on the city Facebook page show the steady progression of the fountain from crimson-spattered winter wonderland to sickly pink wasteland. More than one commenter drew a cinematic parallel. 'Looks like the scene in Fargo were Steve Buscemi is going through the wood chipper...' wrote Mary Mahoney. National news outlets have picked up on the Kansas City fountain put-downs, as well. Let's go, honey: Passersby were treated to a ghastly scene in Kansas City after the failed attempt at showing team spirit . Gory geysers: As the day progressed, the gory frozen geyser progressed from crimson-spattered wonderland to a fleshy pink wasteland . 'Looks like something horrible happened': Pinkish ice and slush shot out of the fountain, which freezes every year into what are usually more pleasant frozen piles . 'Looks like the scene in Fargo were Steve Bushemi is going through the wood chipper,' said one Facebook commenter . 'Sadly, Frosty The Snowman met an untimely demise...' wrote Facebook user Katie Chappelle . USA Today wrote: 'It just looks like there should be police tape around the whole thing' and said the fountain looked like 'something from a horror movie.' 'It looks like something horrible happened here,' wrote Deadspin. While the widespread ridicule of its attempt at showing team pride undoubtedly hurts for the folks of Kansas City, what happened afterwards probably hurts worse. More tranquil times: The fountain is the city's only one that stays on year-round and becomes a spectacle every year when it freezes . 'This is the first time we have attempted to dye a frozen fountain. #ChiefsKingdom,¿ wrote the Kansas City, Missouri Parks and Recreation Department on its Facebook page. Temperatures in Kansas City were expected to dip to zero by Monday evening, making it likely that any pink ice that remains in the fountain won't be melting away any time soon . Hopes were high on Saturday that the Chiefs would break their record streak of seven losing post-season games. Kansas City had raced to a 31-10 halftime lead against the Colts and then took advantage of an interception early in the third quarter to tack on a touchdown that several Chiefs would say later should have sealed the game. But a dismal second half performance ended the game with a painful 45-44 loss for the Chiefs in Indianapolis.

"Sam Warburton has been told he must step up as captain when he leads Wales into the autumn Tests and next year’s World Cup. Warburton will equal Ieuan Evans as the second longest-serving Wales skipper when he wears the armband for the 28th time, against Australia on November 8. Only Ryan Jones (33) has done the job more times. Yet despite having emerged as the face of a brave new side that reached the semi-finals of the World Cup three years ago, he must also now be its voice. Sam Warburton has been told to raise his voice as Wales skipper and take the next step as a leader . Wales coach Warren Gatland (background) wants Warburton's words to match his actions on the pitch . Warburton admits the role has not come naturally and he has gone about his job with the same methodical calmness as childhood hero Jonny Wilkinson. He has led by actions rather than words but Wales coach Warren Gatland, who has worked with legendary leaders Lawrence Dallaglio, Brian O’Driscoll and Paul O’Connell, believes the next 12 months present a significant test of Warburton’s calibre. He said: ‘For Sam, the challenge now is taking the next step as a captain. He has had that experience from 2011 and done it for the Lions. He has established himself in that role for us in his own quiet way. Cool, calm and collected, Warburton admits the captaincy role has not come naturally to him . ‘But players and captains go through stages and we are looking for him to be more vocal and demanding within the squad. He has some great leaders around him, in guys like Alun Wyn Jones, who did a fantastic job for us in South Africa when Sam was injured. ‘But it is important for those leaders to be vocal and have an input for the squad to work effectively. It has been a criticism that we have been too quiet and senior players have not voiced enough of themselves.’ Warburton will equal Ieuan Evans as the second longest-serving Wales skipper when they play Australia . Wales face New Zealand, Australia and South Africa next month and Gatland estimates that they have ‘thrown away’ six wins over the Southern Hemisphere nations in the last four years alone. Most recently, Wales let slip a 12-point lead in the final nine minutes against the Springboks in June and Gatland said: ‘Those are the moments when you need your senior players to speak up. 'We have made poor decisions in the last few minutes of games we should have won. So we will spend time watching the videos, recreating those scenarios and making sure we make better decisions under pressure.’","Wales play Australia in their first Autumn International on November 8 .

"Stuart Lancaster has given the strongest indication yet that Steffon Armitage’s dream of playing for England in next year’s World Cup will not be realised. The Toulon flanker cannot currently be selected for England due to the RFU’s strict policy on overseas players, and last week The Mail on Sunday revealed that Lancaster’s refusal to guarantee he would pick him if he moved to Bath played a large part in scuppering the deal. Armitage, 29, sought assurances that he would be included in Lancaster’s 33-man elite player squad, which was named on Wednesday, but the England head coach would not offer preferential treatment, leading to the Bath deal collapsing and Armitage hinting that he could now try to gain selection for France on residency grounds. England hopeful Steffon Armitage in action for French giants and European champions Toulon against Ulster . When asked if the door was closed on Armitage, Lancaster said: ‘He has obviously chosen to stay at Toulon, so yes in the short term. Armitage's choice to stay at Toulon has shut the door on his England hopes, says Stuart Lancaster . ‘We’ll obviously have to wait and see how it plays out, if there is any truth in the rumour in him wanting to go down a different nationality route. I don’t know. But I’ve made it clear that in order to be playing in this series and the Six Nations he would have to be back here playing, and he’s not.’ When asked if he had refused to offer Armitage any guarantees he would be picked, Lancaster replied: ‘I can’t guarantee anyone anything. It’s right that people have to earn their right to get into the team. I don’t guarantee Chris Robshaw a place. I don’t guarantee anyone. They have to earn the right. It’s the basis of group dynamics. ‘You have got to give everyone a fair and equal opportunity. There are a lot of people who have worked extremely hard to get this opportunity and if you can be on the end of the phone call when you tell a Calum Clark or a Semesa Rokoduguni that he will get a chance to come and train with England it is then unfair to say that actually this guy has got a guaranteed pick.’ Clark’s selection — as first reported in last week’s Mail on Sunday — behind Robshaw, Tom Wood and James Haskell means Armitage appears too far down the pecking order to have a hope of inclusion next September. Lancaster is expected to call up Saracens flanker Will Fraser on Sunday, along with Exeter’s exciting young centre Henry Slade and five other players, including Saracens scrum-half Richard Wigglesworth and Bath winger Anthony Watson. Armitage was linked to a move to Bath but that stalled reportedly when an England place wasn't assured . Calum Clark (centre) is a new face in the England squad, named on Wednesday, ahead of Armitage . The England head coach has told his players that with only 12 Tests to play before the World Cup and ‘time running out’, his side must claim at least three victories in four Tests this autumn, starting against the All Blacks on November 8, to be considered serious contenders. But, with one eye on next year’s home tournament, Lancaster also revealed this week that he intends to use the Test against Samoa on November 22 — which kicks off at 7pm — to streamline procedures for late matches to help players avoid boredom. ‘That week will be a slightly different week anyway,’ Lancaster said. ‘We’ll have played New Zealand and then South Africa — two massively big and physical teams — so we might adapt the week differently and give the players a little bit of a break at the start of the week. We will probably do our captain’s run at a later time of day. Little things like that will be different. ‘By having the captain’s run later, the players might go to bed a bit later and therefore might wake up a bit later. You move your meals accordingly to deal with that evening kick-off. What you do on the day of the game... it’s quite a long time. When you’re a player it’s even worse. You need to fill your day appropriately so that you’re physically firing at the right time. Lancaster said no player in his England squad is guaranteed a place in the team . ‘Part of that then allows us to look at what our processes are and our build-up to evening kick-offs. Because all our World Cup games are evening kick-offs. ‘It was a collective decision by the union because we’ve got three games at 8pm during the World Cup. That does affect how you structure your day. It affects the stadium — playing under floodlights — and everything else. ‘That apart we’ll be operating our build-ups as normal.’ Lancaster’s inclusion of Rokoduguni — an uncapped Fijian-born soldier in the British Army — drew most attention. The 27-year-old has been in scintillating form for Bath this season just two years after signing professional papers and seven years after touring Afghanistan’s notorious Helmand province as an infantryman. ‘I said to the boys at Bath, if you go out on the pitch and something goes wrong you can always come back next week, review it, go through the process and come back better and stronger,’ Rokoduguni told The Mail on Sunday. ‘But out there in Afghanistan you can’t afford to make those kind of mistakes because you are putting someone’s life in danger out there. The naming of Bath flyer Semesa Rokoduguni attracted the most attention when the squad was named . Former British Army infantryman Rokoduguni served in Helmland province in Afghanistan . ‘If you mess something up or miss an opportunity you are letting the boys down and allowing the terrorists time to kill someone. You can’t afford to do that. ‘In my first week out there I witnessed a Marine lose both of his legs and I was thinking to myself, “That could be me”. ‘The way I see it now I want to make every opportunity count and take every single opportunity that comes my way. ‘When you experience something like that it teaches you a lesson in life. That’s how I’m looking at my professional rugby career. I have one go at this and I don’t intend to mess it up.’ Lancaster — a big supporter of the armed forces — will consider asking Rokoduguni to relive his experiences in Afghanistan to the wider squad. ‘I wouldn’t want to put that on him to start with,’ Lancaster said. ‘But potentially (I’ll ask him to talk). ‘I want to settle him in and make him feel comfortable. He came in in June which was great because we got to know him a bit before we flew to New Zealand — he played in that Barbarians game. ‘We’ll see how he goes against the All Blacks.’","England coach Stuart Lancaster said he won't guarantee anyone's place .

"Harlequins deservedly beat local rivals Wasps 23-16 at Adams Park to go joint top of Pool 2 of the European Champions Cup. The win gives them eight points to join Leinster on that figure and the two meetings between these sides in December is likely to decide the destiny of the Pool. Harlequins were the better side throughout and should have won more comfortably. They were far more creative in attack with their points coming from a try by the lively Charlie Matthews and a penalty try award with Nick Evans kicking three penalties and two conversions. Charlie Matthews charges upfield for Harlequins and had a telling contribution against local rivals Wasps . Wasps competed strongly but too many of their key players failed to have any influence on the game. Powerful runners, Nathan Hughes and Ashley Johnson were largely anonymous with star wing, Christian Wade, given no opportunity at all. Joe Simpson provided their only spark by scoring an excellent individual try which Andy Goode converted to add to his three penalties. Wasps were without their captain, James Haskell, who was still recovering from a virus. Sam Jones was included on the flank with Tom Varndell recalled in place of Sailosi Tagicakibau. Harlequins originally made one change from last week's win over Castres with Kyle Sinckler replacing Will Collier at tighthead but they were forced into another when their skipper, Joe Marler, was a late withdrawal with a leg injury so Mark Lambert was called into the line-up. Chris Robshaw took on the captaincy. Quins made a bad start when Marland Yarde fumbled the kick-off but they recovered to push the hosts off their own ball at the resulting scrum. The first 10 minutes were evenly contested before Evans took the first chance for points by kicking a penalty. Wasps also had their opportunities but declined to take two kickable penalties in favour of more attacking options. Their decision to do so proved fruitless as the home side carelessly lost a line-out and a scrum. When the third opportunity came, Wasps went for the posts and Goode succeeded with a penalty but this was soon nullified by one from Evans to give Quins a 6-3 lead at the end of a disjointed first quarter. Mike Brown is tackled by Wasps Nathan Hughes in the European Champions Cup clash . Harlequins were becoming the dominant force and almost scored the first try of the game. A neat pass from George Lowe sent David Ward through a gap allowing the hooker to run 30 metres before being hauled down. Quins maintained the movement and appeared to have scored when Matthews crossed the line but the TMO ruled that the lock had been held up. Against the run of play, Wasps took the lead with a solo try from Simpson. On the visitors 22, Simpson surprisingly robbed Luke Wallace of the ball to race away for the try which Goode converted. Quins quickly responded with an excellent try when skilful handling resulted in Mike Brown sending in Matthews for the try which Evans converted to give the visitors a deserved 13-10 interval lead. Wasps fumbled the restart and soon conceded another penalty which Evans kicked to extend the advantage but Goode responded with two of his own, one an excellent effort from inside his own half. These penalties were the only scores of an error-ridden third quarter, which ended with the scores level at 16-16. Quins produced another flowing movement and looked set to score but Danny Care knocked on five metres out from the home line but from the scrum Wasps, who had just lost their hooker, Carlo Festuccia through injury, were pushed off the ball. From the reset, Wasps were unable to contain their opponents' drive and conceded a penalty try which Evans converted. The outside half missed two penalties late on but it scarcely mattered as Quins remained in control until the final whistle.","Nick Evans kicked three penalties and two conversions for Harlequins .

"The Scarlets claimed a first win of their European Champions Cup Pool Three campaign with a gutsy triumph over Leicester Tigers in an error-strewn Anglo-Welsh clash at Parc y Scarlets. Tries in each half by wing Harry Robinson and man of the match Aled Davies were enough for the West Walians to claim a deserved 15-3 victory against a side who had beaten them in six of their seven previous European meetings. Their effort was all the more impressive considering the Welsh region suffered a glut of early injuries - including captain Scott Williams, who limped off midway through the first half. Man of the match Aled Davies crashes over for the Scarlets to seal a 15-3 victory for the Welsh side . The Tigers were a shadow of the side who saw off Ulster in round one, with mistakes handing the Scarlets both their tries. The Scarlets had gone into the game looking to replicate the dogged display they delivered out in Toulon - despite falling to a 28-18 defeat. As for Leicester, their target was to keep pace with the French giants following an opening win over Ulster at Welford Road. Scarlets fly-half Rhys Priestland makes an early break through the Leicester Tigers defence . The Scarlets' cause was not helped when Wales lock Jake Ball damaged a hamstring in the warm-up and was forced to withdraw. Richard Kelly took his place in the starting line-up. It was all Tigers in the early stages and centre Anthony Allen, in his first game back from a knee injury, should have scored, but spilled the ball with the line at his mercy. The visitors' pressure was rewarded when Williams slotted a 14th-minute penalty after the home side had been penalised for holding on. Tigers fly-half Owen Williams fires over a penalty for the visitors; it was the Tigers only score of the match . But, having dominated the early exchanges, Leicester then proceeded to gift the Scarlets the game's opening try. And it was all down to a horrible error from wing Miles Benjamin. Fielding a long kick and seemingly under little pressure, Benjamin spilled the ball attempting to run out from his own line; Rhys Priestland gathered and fed right wing Robinson, who had the simple task of scoring. Scarlets number eight Rory Pitman is forced to leave the field with a shoulder injury . Priestland missed with the conversion from wide out then pushed a 45-metre penalty attempt wide. After the international fly-half was off-target with his third shot, the kicking duties were handed over to replacement Steve Shingler - on for the injured Williams - and he made no mistake to make it 8-3 after 33 minutes. Shingler was handed another shot at the posts after Tigers had infringed at a line-out, but his kick was off target, to the frustration of the home fans. On the stroke of half-time, after Scarlets had infringed at the breakdown, it was Tigers fly-half Williams who caught the bug, missing a long-range attempt with five points separating the sides at the interval. Kristian Philips crashes through the attempted tackle of Ben Youngs (right) but is halted by Owen Williams . Wing Kristian Phillips went close for the Scarlets early in the second half, then Fijian flyer Vereniki Goneva almost snaffled an interception for Tigers. It needed some desperate defence from the visitors to keep the Scarlets out after a scything break from Priestland on 57 minutes. But it was not long before the Scarlets were celebrating a second try and again it came from a Leicester error. Scrum-half Ben Youngs went on an arcing blindside run, but lost the ball attempting his off-loaded. It landed in the arms of opposite number Aled Davies, who gratefully raced 40 metres unopposed to the whitewash. Shingler converted to make it 15-3 and, despite some late pressure, the Scarlets were able to see out the win, while denying the Tigers even the consolation of a losing bonus point.","Scarlets claim first win of their European Champions Cup campaign .

"George North's stunning four-try blitz catapulted Northampton to a bonus-point win at Franklin’s Gardens last night, but Luther Burrell gave England another injury scare as he went off with damage to his left hand. The Saints ignited their Champions Cup campaign courtesy of North’s heroics and in the process became the first team to beat the Ospreys this season. While their Welsh wing provided the deadly finishing, the hosts were also well served by their England contingent, especially flankers Calum Clark and Tom Wood, and lock Courtney Lawes, while fly-half Stephen Myler ran the show with calm authority. George North lays on the floor as he is congratulated by team-mate Kahn Fotuali'l during Northampton's win . North (pictured left) scored a quartet of tries to reinvigorate Northampton's European campaign . North races away from Ospreys winger Jeff Hassler as the Welsh winger ran  riot at Franklin's Gardens . With the national squad going into camp this evening, head coach Stuart Lancaster will anxiously await updates on Burrell, who was withdrawn just after half-time and was due to go for an X-ray. England already have a long casualty list and they could do without losing another centre, after learning that Manu Tuilagi will miss the whole QBE series of four Tests. Jim Mallinder, Northampton’s director of rugby, said: ‘Luther has banged his hand, it’s very sore and he’s struggling to grip. Fingers crossed there’s no permanent damage.’ England centre Luther Burrell had to depart early on after suffering an injury to his right hand . Saints were seeking to bounce back from their defeat against Racing Metro in Paris a week earlier and this was the emphatic result they craved. Myler’s goal-kicking was immaculate and yielded 14 points, but North — who had begun the season with a hat-trick against Gloucester — dominated the scoreboard again. His first try stemmed from a turn-over and Myler’s long, floated pass which presented a simple run on the outside to the line. Next, North supported Ken Pisi’s weaving break down the right and took the inside off-load which put him in the clear. Burrell (left) was in the think of the action before his injury offloading to Saints flanker Calum Clark . Northampton and England flanker Tom Wood rises high to claim a lineout at full stretch . After the break, the 22-year-old smashed over from close range and, three minutes from time, he stole the ball out wide for a superb solo effort — kicking ahead and winning the race to touch down. ‘It’s the first time I’ve scored four tries in a game, so I’m very happy with my performance,’ said North. ‘That performance was definitely up there for me personally, but it was a whole team effort — we knew we needed a big performance and that’s what we produced.’","England centre Luther Burrell left the field with damage to his left hand .

Bryan Habana's try on the stroke of half-time - which gave the visitors a 16-3 half-time lead - and then an interception score in the 58th minute from Delon Armitage saw Toulon home, with huge performances also from Steffon Armitage and Juan Smith. Leigh Halfpenny also contributed, with three penalties and two conversions. The hosts landed two penalties from Paddy Jackson, who also converted Craig Gilroy's late consolation try, but defeat left Ulster's bid to make the last eight looking effectively over.

Irish international openside Henry (left) feels the full force of Toulon substitute Juan Smith's tackle . The French side had the first scoring opportunity after two minutes, but Halfpenny's monster wind-assisted penalty from inside his own half, which came just after Juan Fernandez Lobbe left the action with a leg injury to be replaced by Juan Smith, drifted wide. He was on target seven minutes later, though, after Ulster were penalised at a scrum following a Toulon break deep in their own territory which had seen Gilroy kick for touch on the full without realising he had run the ball into his own 22. This became 6-0 on 13 minutes when Halfpenny nailed his second penalty after Ulster were penalised for not releasing, but Ulster hit back on 20 minutes with Jackson's first shot at goal after Louis Ludik was illegally wrapped up in a tackle. Toulon and Wales fullback Leigh Halfpenny fires over a penalty for the French giants in Belfast . Ulster then began to exert some territorial squeeze on the European champions, who then lost fly-half Matt Giteau to a leg injury after he had cleared from near his own line and James O'Connor replaced him. Then just after the half-hour, Toulon moved a ball wide at pace from a lineout and Halfpenny put Delon Armitage clear to dive over in the right corner, only for the final pass to be called forward. Halfpenny made it 9-3 with two minutes of the half remaining after Ulster's scrum again fell foul of referee Wayne Barnes, but the killer blow then came right at the end of the half when Habana scorched over in the same corner as Armitage's earlier disallowed effort. Toulon's Delon Armitage intercepted a wayward Nick Williams pass to race away for a decisive try . The TMO was consulted but awarded the try which came after Toulon had injected pace into a sweeping move which went left and right. Halfpenny nailed a brilliant conversion and the half ended with the visitors leading 16-3. Ulster needed to score first after the sides resumed and Jackson did the necessary on 44 minutes after Delon Armitage's high hit on Stuart Olding to narrow the gap to 10 points. Halfpenny was then wide with a 51st-minute penalty into the wind and then four minutes later Jackson did the same, before Ulster's inaccuracy coughed up the game's decisive score which saw Delon Armitage intercept a Nick Williams pass and run most of the length of the field to dot down under the sticks. Ulster winger Craig Gilroy's try was merely a consolation for the northern province . Halfpenny's conversion of the 58th-minute try made it 23-6 to the French side, which effectively sealed the result. However, Ulster refused to wilt and, with three minutes remaining, Gilroy swept in for a consolation score after O'Connor had missed touch and Tommy Bowe and Jared Payne had countered. Jackson drop-kicked the conversion to narrow the visitors' lead to 23-13 and they saw out the remaining minute without Habana, who was yellow-carded for a deliberate knock-on. All that remained was Ian Humphreys' penalty shot from halfway for a losing bonus, but it fell short.","Wales and Lions fullback Leigh Halfpenny kicks three penalties and adds two conversion for Toulon .

"Historic winter chills made Sunday night's game the coldest game ever played by the San Francisco 49ers, but their California-raised star quarterback led them to victory in short sleeves. It was just 5 degrees out when Colin Kaepernick emerged onto Green Bay, Wisconsin's Lambeau Field and while the temperature continued to plummet, Kaepernick's performance only heated up. 'It's not that cold, it's all mental,' said the smiling and defiant 26-year-old. Mental: California-born San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick went defiantly sleeveless during Sunday's game in Wisconsin against the Green Bay Packers as temperatures plummeted to a bone chilling -10 . 'It's pretty awesome': Kaepernick had fans, teammates and his coach Jim Harbaugh astounded by his winning clutch performance . While Kaepernick made a statement with his bare, tattooed arms, even the Packers' longtime quarterback Aaron Rodgers wore sleeves. 'In Nevada, we didn't have jackets on the sidelines or beanies or heaters,' the University of Nevada, Reno alum said. 'I've played in cold-weather games before.' Born in Milwaukee and raised a Packers fan, Kaepernick beat Green Bay for the third time in 12 months, as the San Francisco 49ers rode their quarterback to a 23-20 wild-card playoff victory at frigid Lambeau Field on Sunday. Bundled: San Franciscans are accustomed to temperate weather but came out to root for their hometown team in the bone chilling cold of Green Bay, Wisconsin on Sunday night nonetheless . Will cheese keep them warm: Packers fans look far more accustomed to the Midwestern chill as they stride confidently at Lambeau Field on Sunday while carrying their signature cheese head hats . San Francisco 49ers coach Jim Harbaugh is a man of halting words at most news conferences, but the former NFL quarterback could hardly contain himself when asked about Sunday's performance of his signal caller, Colin Kaepernick. Three times at critical junctures, . Kaepernick used his long strides to make big runs that set up scores in . the visiting Niners' 23-20 victory over the Green Bay Packers in a . wild-card round playoff game at frigid Lambeau Field. Dashing: The California born Wisconsin native dashed 42 yards up the middle to help put the Niners back in front 13-7 in the first half, and after San Francisco fell back 17-13, he ripped off a 24-yard run to set up another score for a 20-17 lead . 'In Nevada, we didn't have jackets on the sidelines or beanies or heaters,"" said the University of Nevada, Reno alum. 'I've played in cold-weather games before, and I feel like it's more mental than anything' 'He answers in the clutch time of the game, in the important down, when it matters most,' said Harbaugh. 'He's Kaepernick tough. It's pretty awesome.' The long-striding Wisconsin native dashed 42 yards up the middle to help put the Niners back in front 13-7 in the first half, and after San Francisco fell back 17-13, he ripped off a 24-yard run to set up another score for a 20-17 lead. After Green Bay tied the score 20-20, Kaepernick did it again. Even opposing Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers (left) wore sleeves as temperatures plummeted at Lambeau Field on Sunday . 'He has those tattoos he needs to show off,' tackle Joe Staley joked. On a third-and-eight from the Green Bay 38-yard line, just outside field goal range with 70 seconds left, Kaepernick rolled left to avert the rush and gained 11 yards to keep the drive alive and move the ball into game-winning field goal range. He also gained 98 yards on seven runs, to lead the game in rushing. Harbaugh said none of the plays was drawn up and that the close guarding of receivers by Green Bay defenders dictated the reaction of the 6-foot-5 Kaepernick. Inspiring: A San Francisco 49ers fan holds up a painting of Kaepernick before Sunday's record-book performance . 'There wasn't a whole lot called out there today,' Harbaugh said about the officials giving defenders a fair amount of leeway. 'Our receivers were getting grabbed. And I think Colin saw that and just took matters into his own hands.' What impressed Harbaugh most was how fast Kaepernick could turn the corner as he raced away from would-be tacklers. 'He . was around the edge a couple of those times so fast, it was 15, 20 . yards. It was unbelievable the way he was getting the edge. It was so . clutch,' the coach gushed. 'Colin Kaepernick, I think we can all agree, is a clutch performer. It's not his first time doing this.' Harbaugh . drew some heat last year when he tabbed Kaepernick as his quarterback . in midseason ahead of former overall number one pick Alex Smith and rode . the young signal caller all the way to the Super Bowl before falling to . the Baltimore Ravens. Kaepernick, who grew up rooting for the Packers, has enjoyed some spectacular games against Green Bay. In . last year's 45-31 win in the second round of the playoffs, Kaepernick . rushed for an NFL quarterback's record 181 yards with two touchdowns. In . this season's opener against Green Bay, Kaepernick set a personal best . by throwing for 412 passing yards, including three touchdowns, in a . 34-28 Niners' win. Harbaugh said the way Kaepernick eats up yards with his long strides set him apart from other quarterbacks. 'The unique part is just how much ground he covers with the strides, just how fast he gets an edge,' the coach said. 'Amazing': Harbaugh (right) is a man of halting words at most news conferences, but the former NFL quarterback could hardly contain himself when asked about Sunday's performance of his signal caller . 'How . much ground he covers when he steps up into the pocket - it's five, 10, . 20 (yards). It's happening pretty fast. I think that's unique. I've . never seen that before.' Harbaugh . passed along some praise for rival quarterback Aaron Rodgers, Green . Bay's Super Bowl most valuable player three years ago, who made some . crucial escapes from pass rushes to make big plays for the Packers. 'The . first one that led to the touchdown was spectacular, the second one was . a heckuva play as well,' Harbaugh said about Rodgers' performance. 'Our quarterback had two and some more.' 'Colin Kaepernick, I think we can all agree, is a clutch performer. It's not his first time doing this,' said the 26-year-old's coach Jim Harbaugh . 'He answers in the clutch time of the game, in the important down, when it matters most,' said Harbaugh .","The defiant 26-year-old Colin Kaepernick made a statement by refusing to wear sleeves or a jacket .

"Ian Madigan kicked Leinster to victory in a tense Champions Cup match at Castres. The Ireland international, playing at inside centre this week after starting at full-back against Wasps last weekend, kicked all the Guinness PRO12 side's points as they came from behind at Stade Pierre Antoine to win 21-16 and maintain their perfect start to the European rugby season. The win also ensured that Madigan's midfield partner Gordon D'Arcy could celebrate a successful 100th European game. Ian Madigan scored all of Leinster's 21 points as they twice came from behind to beat Castres in France . Ramiro Herrera holds off a tackle as Castres pack proved the dominant force during the first half . Madigan ensured Leinster went into the dressing room at half-time 9-7 up, as the Irish side enjoyed the better of a fast and furious opening period. Castres opened the scoring with a classic catch-and-drive move as they threatened a repeat of last season's fast European getaway against the same opponents. Last January's encounter in the old Heineken Cup saw Castres race into a 14-0 lead inside the opening quarter. On Sunday, the 2013 Top 14 champions were 7-0 ahead after six minutes, as first the pack grunted and forced their way through a splintered Leinster defence to the line, then Geoffrey Palis - as injured scrum-half Rory Kockott watched on from the stands - sent the home fans wild. From then, though, the first half belonged to the visitors as they hammered at Castres' defence, in much the same way as Harlequins had at the Stoop a week earlier. Sean Cronin looks to spread the ball but the Castres defence held Leinster at arms length for most of the game . Devin Toner wins line out ball for Leinster ahead of Richie Gray as Leinster continued their good start . The difference this week, however, was in the pack. Returning prop Ramiro Herrera brought extra scrummaging might, and where Castres had struggled against Quins in their opening game, here they were in the ascendancy. The home side's pack were in charge of just about every scrum; they were in control at the line-outs and they were brutal at the breakdown. And when Leinster's backs did get ball in hand, the Castres' defence held them at arm's length. For all their first-half pressure, Leinster only had three Madigan penalties to their name when the referee signalled the end of the first period. It could have been four, but the inside centre fired one last effort wide after the hooter had sounded. Ibrahim Diarra carries the ball for Castres but the Leinster defence holds strong at Stade Pierre Antoine . Eoin Reddan makes a half break but Leinster were unable to get over the line despite controlling long periods . The second half opened in the same guts-and-glory style as the first. Palis kicked two early penalties, as Castres overturned their first-half deficit. He extended their lead after 56 minutes with a third second-half penalty to take the score to 16-9. Herrera, who had just returned to the side after playing for Argentina in the Rugby Championship, left the pitch to a standing ovation. But the intensity could not last. As players tired and the game slowed down, both sides began making mistakes. And it was Leinster and Madigan who benefited most. With five minutes remaining, the home side were a single point ahead, and seemed to have the measure of Leinster. But they conceded two late penalties, which the ice-cool Madigan, with jeers and boos ringing around the stadium, converted.

"An on-line community of Republic of Ireland football fans believe the FAI has ‘systematic flaws’ in how it allocates tickets for senior internationals.

Their statement read: 'This is not the first time that the Irish support has expressed serious concerns over the methodology for the allocation of tickets for key away games. 'In previous meetings between the FAI and site members, detailed proposals were presented for an away ticketing scheme.

"Even the greatest stage needs a memorable performance to bring it alive and Noble Mission delivered an award-winning one on Saturday to produce the most thrilling and emotional victory of the 2014 Flat season on Champions Day at Ascot. Two years after the great Frankel had ended his career with victory in the Qipco Champion Stakes for the late Sir Henry Cecil, his little brother, trained by Cecil’s widow Jane, lifted the same Group One prize. For a few strides well inside the furlong, it looked as if jockey James Doyle’s efforts to make all the running would be in vain as Noble Mission was headed by Al Kazeem but the 7-1 shot refused to buckle as he bravely thrust his head back in front. Jockey James Doyle celebrates after winning The Qipco Champion Stakes at Ascot . The cold nuts and bolts of the result are that Noble Mission’s neck success bagged over £770,000 for Lady Cecil’s stable, more than twice the total managed by the rest of her horses in Britain this season. But this was about much, much more. It was an emotional and overwhelming justification of Lady Cecil’s decision to continue to run her husband’s Warren Place stables in Newmarket. To suggest a little intervention from above helped lift home the horse he used to train may be overly sentimental but if Sir Henry was looking down on the corner of Berkshire he ruled as a trainer, he would have no doubt done so with contented smile. Lady Cecil, struggling to hold back the tears, said: ‘I think I am going to wake up and realise that I’ve been dreaming. I was interviewed before the race, which I didn’t really want to do, and I said it would be a fairytale to win and it absolutely is. Lady Cecil was close to tears after Noble Mission's victory on Champions Day at Ascot . ‘We knew he was in the form of his life but we hardly dared to dream it could happen. It was a tough race and he toughed it out. ‘I had my head in my hands. I was so scared he wasn’t going to hang on.’ Racing can seem obsessed with making sure it doesn’t accentuate the positive. It happened again ahead of Champions Day at Ascot. The ground was heavy, not ideal for horses bred to run like the wind, but the going has seemed even tougher for the meeting’s organisers. As high-profile names headed by dual Derby winner Australia joined the list of absentees, a familiar question surfaced. Is a Saturday in late October the right stage for the most valuable day’s Flat racing in Britain? Given a blank piece of paper, British Champions Series would choose a different day but British racing’s major meetings must be arranged in conjunction with other European nations, who can veto anything they believe would have an adverse effect on their programmes. That means moving British Champions Day is a non-runner. But what we are stuck with is not bad. Almost 30,000 spectators were at Ascot to watch 17 Group One winners. Sure, more needs to be done — Ascot and BCS must see if there is a way to cover the track to shield it from the worst of the autumn weather. Marcus Townend . Sir Henry used to raise the family standard above Warren Place whenever he had a Group One winner and it will be flying proudly again this morning as his widow maintains the tradition. Lady Cecil, who took over the trainer’s licence when Sir Henry died shortly before 2013 Royal Ascot, certainly has reason to treasure Noble Mission. Lady Cecil’s first full year in charge has not been easy but Noble Mission has also won two other overseas Group One prizes — the Tattersalls Gold Cup in Ireland and the Grand Prix de Saint Cloud in France. What the five-year-old now does has yet to be decided by owner Prince Khalid Abdullah but it will be a big surprise if he does not join Frankel at stud. Doyle appeared to execute a perfectly timed ride to hold off Roger Charlton’s Al Kazeem — a horse he usually rides. But there was a sting in the tail. He received a £10,000 fine and a seven-day ban for using his whip above the permitted level. Third was Dermot Weld’s Free Eagle, while 7-4 favourite Cirrus Des Aigles was fifth. Noble Mission’s win gave British Champions day the big result it needs and one that the Queen’s Estimate was unable to supply. The 2013 Gold Cup winner could not cope with the heavy ground and trailed in last in the Long Distance Cup behind Weld’s Forgotten Rules. The £240,000 Night Of Thunder’s second place in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes should be more than enough to secure Richard Hannon a first trainers’ title in his first season since taking over from his father., .

"Brendan Rodgers is ready to persist with Mario Balotelli in Liverpool’s starting line-up against Hull and give him the chance to turn his season around. With just one goal in 10 matches since his £16million move from AC Milan, Balotelli’s displays have been so mundane that Liverpool may decide to offload him in January if it proves that he cannot adapt to their style of play. The Italian striker was hauled off after 45 minutes of the 3-0 defeat by Real Madrid on Wednesday. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Brendan Rodgers discuss the upcoming Hull City match . Mario Balotelli could be backed by Brendan Rodgers and handed a place in the startling XI against Hull . Rodgers took Balotelli off at half-time against Real Madrid but described the substitution as 'purely tactical' Rodgers described the substitution as ‘purely tactical’, but Balotelli has been heavily criticised for swapping shirts with Madrid defender Pepe at half-time. Even though Rickie Lambert is waiting in the wings, Balotelli is expected to start on Saturday afternoon at Anfield against Steve Bruce’s side. Liverpool’s manager would not shy away from making the big call to drop Balotelli but, for the moment, Rodgers is prepared to keep faith with the 24-year-old and he will lead the line as his side chase a third consecutive win in the Barclays Premier League. Balotelli and Real's Pepe exchanged jerseys as the players made their way down the tunnel for half-time . Balotelli angered the home support and guaranteed a few more headlines by swapping shirts with Real's Pepe . It has been a difficult 48 hours for Balotelli, as he has been the subject of a complaint to Greater Manchester Police over allegations he verbally threatened a woman in the Wythenshawe area on Thursday afternoon after it was said she took photos of his £250,000 Ferrari. His alleged victim told the Manchester Evening News: ‘I hadn’t even taken any pictures. He came and looked through the front window. ‘He was wearing a black beanie hat and he gave me a bit of a fright. I don’t care who he is, I won’t be threatened like that.’ What Liverpool could do with more than anything on Saturday is collecting three points with neither a hint of controversy nor the concession of a goal.

Balotelli was the subject of a complaint to Greater Manchester Police over allegations he threatened a woman . But that will be easier said than done against a Hull team for whom Rodgers says he has the utmost respect. Such have been Liverpool’s travails in recent weeks that Rodgers has admitted to being up in his kitchen in the middle of the night, attempting to work out a formula that will get his team back in the form that saw them finish runners-up last year. ‘The other night I was up at 4.30am, down in my kitchen, looking and thinking of ways that I could make us better and improve,’ said Rodgers. ‘That is something I have got, a hunger to make this group better. ‘Yeah, we are looking to get balance in the team — balance is the most important thing in football — but with limited coaching time. That is something I have to look at definitely.’ Balotelli is just one of the problems that Liverpool manager Rodgers is still trying to figure out this season . Liverpool have conceded 19 goals in 12 matches this season and only kept one clean sheet in 18 games since March 30 but Rodgers has robustly dismissed bringing in a defensive coach, a topic that has been raised by supporters. When asked if he had given thought to the idea, Rodgers said: ‘No. No. No chance. No chance. No. When I came in, I was asked whether I would have someone to come in and help the strikers score. We got goals. I think it is just the lack of coaching time that is impacting. ‘Listen, we can’t complain. We are in the big competitions and there is an expectancy on us, which there should be.

"Stoke manager Mark Hughes has warned Southampton counterpart Ronald Koeman to expect a far rougher ride on Saturday compared to their recent stroll against Sunderland. The Saints head into their latest Premier League clash with Stoke on a high after hammering the woeful Wearsiders 8-0 last Saturday. On the back of a run of five wins in their last six league matches, Koeman's side are a heady third in the table and will no doubt be confident of adding Stoke to their recent list of scalps. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Mark Hughes gives credit to Southampton's new recruits . Stoke City manager Mark Hughes insists his side won't be a pushover when they face Southampton . Ronald Koeman's Southampton sit third in the Premier League after beating Sunderland 8-0 last Saturday . Hughes, though, has no doubt his side will give Southampton more of a run for their money, even though they were beaten 3-1 by Sunderland themselves just three weeks ago. 'It was an outstanding result,' said Hughes of Southampton's win over the Black Cats. 'It doesn't matter at what level you play. To beat another team 8-0 is an outstanding performance. 'We go there with them on an obvious high given the performance and result, but we're in a confident mood ourselves. 'We won last time out, so we'd like to think we'll make a better fist of it - should I suggest. 'We'll recognise the talent and ability they have in their squad, but we've plenty of that ourselves, so they know it will be a difficult game for them. 'It's up to us to make sure (the win over Sunderland) was a one-off performance and result, and is not something that will influence our game.' Southampton striker Graziano Pelle celebrates after scoring the fifth goal against Sunderland . Many experts have been surprised by what Southampton have achieved so far this season given the departure of manager Mauricio Pochettino over the summer to Tottenham along with the exit of a number of key players. Koeman, however, has bought well in Hughes' eyes, with the likes of Graziano Pelle and Dusan Tadic in particular immediately taking to life in the Premier League. 'When things change in such a short space of time it's difficult because they lost their manager and they lost two or three key players who had been exceptional for them the year previously,' added Hughes. 'There was perhaps a fear if they didn't get the right players in, and the right manager, then there could be a difficulty. 'But in fairness they have not had the issue of being unable to go into the market and spend good money. 'They've had a decent amount of money to work with that has enabled them to get good quality into the building. 'After that, of course, you have the problem of getting the dynamic and balance right in the dressing room, but they seem to have done that, and that's the impressive thing. 'I'm sure they're very happy with how their season has gone because there was talk they would struggle - not a view I shared I have to say - but there is always that worry when you make changes.' Back-to-back home wins - after starting the season with consecutive home defeats - have helped propel Stoke up to a respectable 10th in the table. Hughes feels after the early-season blip the critics were too hasty to write off his team, adding: 'At the beginning of the year I think everybody's view was shaped very, very quickly. 'As a consequence of losing our first two home games people assumed we'd had a really poor start, which wasn't really the case. 'We've done okay, and now we've had back-to-back home wins which have really encouraged us, and we've been okay on our travels, probably better than we were this time last year. 'So we're quite happy with where we are at the moment.'

None of the four Premier League matches between the teams have ended with a victory . Southampton’s style under Koeman is illustrated by their total of 199 tackles, more than any other side. Southampton have hit the most shots on target in the Premier League this season (50) while Stoke have allowed the least on their own goal (20). Southampton have the best penalty record of any regular team in the Premier League (53 taken, 51 scored). Fraser Forster has the best saves to shots rate of any regular goalkeeper in the Premier League this season (75 per cent). Conversely, Stoke’s Asmir Begovic has the lowest saves to shots rate of any regular keeper (53 per cent). Southampton have kept clean sheets in three of their last four Premier League home games.","Southampton host Stoke City at St Mary's Stadium (Saturday 3pm)

"Southampton manager Ronald Koeman was more satisfied by his side's performance against Stoke than their annihilation of Sunderland last week. Saints continue to make a mockery of the doom merchants, with this 1-0 win moving them back up to second in the Barclays Premier League. Sadio Mane's first-half strike proved the difference as they secured a fourth successive victory at St Mary's, although Stoke made them work for it. Ronald Koeman congratulates Saido Mane after his match winning goal against Stoke . The Saints moved up to second in the Premier League table to silence their pre-season doubters . It was a far cry from last weekend's 8-0 humbling of Sunderland, but manager Koeman was actually more impressed by this display. 'It was difficult because we didn't kill the game,' the Dutchman said. 'We created eight good chances and you know if you don't score the second one it's difficult. 'Stoke put everything in, changed the system after an hour and with the physical strength that they have it was difficult. 'Football is strange because the first half was much better than last week. I think it was one of the best first halves of the season. 'In the second half we lost sometimes too easy our position. 'They didn't create a lot, we deserved our win but it was a difficult one, more difficult than last week and maybe more nicer to win like this than last week because the lads showed great character and great ambition again. 'We had a great support of our fans and a great win.' Mane repaid his manager's faith in recalling him by scoring the winner in the first half . Mame Biram Diouf is tackled by Nathanial Clyne on the edge of the area as Stoke chase an equaliser . While the scoreline was not as sweet as last week's, it offered match-winner Mane the chance to make up for last week's disappointment. The Senegalese summer signing thought he had scored the eighth against Sunderland, only for his first goal for Saints to be harshly stripped off him by the Premier League's dubious goals panel. 'I heard it yesterday and I explained to Mane and his reaction was okay,' Koeman said. 'Maybe that was the reason he came to the bench and to say this one they will not take it away again. 'He had a great performance - he's fast, he's a good player but his defending attitude is important for the team.' Mane thought he had scored the final goal in Saints' 8-0 drubbing of Sunderland before it was chalked off . Mane gave Stoke a torrid time in the first half but, like his team-mates, was unable to make the same impact after half-time. City boss Mark Hughes was pleased by the way his side responded to a one-sided opening period, but knows that 45 minutes cost them. 'From our point of view, we're a little bit disappointed with the first half, really,' he said. 'We didn't really ask enough questions of Southampton, made it a little bit too easy, showed them a little too much respect, I would suggest, which is understandable to a certain extent given their exploits last time out here. Mark Hughes was disappointed with how his players reacted to a dominant first half from Southampton . 'I think that was the case in the first half. They caused us a few problems at set plays and obviously from one of the ones we didn't deal with it dropped handily for them and they've been able to dispatch the winning goal. 'Second half, I thought we were a lot better. We made a change very early on, got Mame Diouf on, and that gave us a threat in behind and that stretched the game. 'It allowed us to control of the game and in the second half I thought we were the better side, but we never really created those clear-cut chances we need to get back on level terms.'","Southampton defeated Stoke City 1-0 in their Premier League clash .

"Lady Cecil has spoken of the huge significance of Noble Mission’s Qipco Champions Stakes win to the long-term future of her Newmarket stable. But she has not been told whether she will still be training Frankel’s younger brother next year or if any relative of the legendary unbeaten horse will be stabled at Warren Place in 2015. Frankel, as well as his four siblings, have all raced for Lady Cecil or her late husband Sir Henry. Lady Cecil congratulates Noble Mission ridden by James Doyle after winning the British Champion Stakes . Half-sister Joyeuse, a dual winner at Listed race level, will return to owner Prince Khaled Abdullah’s stud this week after her racing career ended with a sixth place in the Challenge Stakes at Newmarket on Friday. Abdullah, the owner of around half the 50 horses in Lady Cecil’s care, has a yearling full-brother by Galileo to both Frankel and Noble Mission to go into training in 2015. His racing manager, Lord Grimthorpe, said the link between his boss and Warren Place remained strong but that no decision had been made about whether Noble Mission would be retired or if the latest in the family line would follow in their hoofprints to Warren Place. Grimthorpe, who said Abdullah had around 20 foals from Frankel’s first crop to put into training, added: ‘No decision has been made about where any of our yearlings will be trained has been made and won’t be for some time. The Prince is still thinking what to do with Noble Mission.’ The organisers of Champions Day might have thought they had used up all their luck having the best horse in a generation in Frankel to run at their meeting in its first two years, not only winning the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes in 2011 and the Champion Stakes in 2012 but adding priceless impetus to its launch. But they were clearly wrong as his brother produced the perfect climax to Saturday’s season-ending finale. For Lady Cecil, it was not only hugely emotional to be standing in the same place as her husband two years earlier after winning Britain’s most valuable race, but also a galloping prime time advertisement for the stable which now carries her name. Noble Mission (left)  beats Al Kazeem (right) to win the British Champion Stakes  at Ascot . Lady Cecil said: ‘It is hugely important for people to see we can do it. It is wonderful to have owners like Prince Khaled and the Niarchos family but it is always good to attract new people. ‘It would be lovely some looked at Noble on Saturday and think they are doing a good job why don’t we give them a try. ‘We thought Noble Mission was in great shape but you just don’t dare to dream it. Being Frankel’s brother, to win the race he went out on, you couldn’t make it up.’ It was a third Group One win of the season for Noble Mission, who had previously won the Tattersalls Gold Cup and Grand Prix de Saint Cloud. He has been a standard bearer for Cecil in her first full season at the helm, his form and reputation transformed by the front-running tactics so efficiently carried out by jockey James Doyle, who is unlikely to appeal against the seven-day ban and £10,000 fine for using his whip above the permitted level. It will cost him mounts at the Breeders’ Cup and in the Melbourne Cup. The jockey said: ‘The rules are there and you have to take the consequences. Hopefully the suspension and the fine won't overshadow what happened. I don't what such a great race marred by people saying he got a ban and a fine. That would be upsetting.’ Doyle’s wish will probably come true. Doyle takes the acclaim of the crowd after winning on board Noble Mission .","Noble Mission won the Champion Stakes at Ascot .

"In a game that attracted a worldwide audience of around 400 million people, Real Madrid claimed El Clasico bragging rights with a 3-1 destruction of Barcelona. Luis Suarez impressed on his long-awaited debut but it was Neymar who silenced the Bernabeu by opening the scoring after only four minutes before Cristiano Ronaldo sent the teams in level with a penalty for his 16th league goal of the season. The second half belonged to the hosts who doubled their lead through a header from defender Pepe before Karim Benzema completed a beautiful passing move to slot home their third and final goal. Here, Sportsmail's Pete Jenson gives  his verdict on how the players performed. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Real Madrid players celebrate after earning a 3-1 win against Barcelona in El Clasico . Luis Suarez (C) made his long-awaited debut for Barcelona but could not get on the scoresheet . Lionel Messi finished on the losing side in the latest installment of his personal rivalry with Cristiano Ronaldo . Real Madrid: . Iker Casillas - 7 . His first half save from Lionel Messi changed the game. Had it been 2-0 so early Barcelona would have controlled the game and passed Real into submission. Still the man for the big occasion. Dani Carvajal - 7 . Steady defensively and got forward well to support the attacks. Came back into the side for Alvaro Arbeloa and justified the recall. Portugal defender Pepe rises up to put real Madrid in the lead with a header from a corner . Sergio Ramos - 6 . Had to work overtime in the first half as Luis Suarez tormented Marcelo and found space in behind the often absent Brazilian full-back. The two continued their duel in the second half and he was as relieved as anyone when the Uruguyan departed on 70 minutes. Pepe - 7 . All over the place in the opening stages of the game but recovered his composure and his towering header was the most important goal of the game. Impressive display that shows why he still keeps Raphael Varane out of the side … just. Marcelo - 6 . Struggled defensively in the first half especially but always has that burst of energy to turn defence into attack and as Barça struggled with Real's counter-attacks in the second half really began to come into his own. Isco (R) was one of Real Madrid's star performers as he seized his chance in the absence of Gareth Bale . Toni Kroos - 7 . Still keeping his head above water in Real Madrid's Xabi-less midfield. Alonso's shoes are tough to fill but the German did well in his first real test this season. Set up Pepe's goal with a perfect corner. Luka Modric - 7 . Roared off in the second half as Carlo Ancelotti replaced him. The former Tottenham man is idolized by the Bernabeu and once again in the most difficult of games he stood up to be counted. Isco - 8 . Ancelotti said in midweek: 'Isco knows that if Bale is fit then Bale always plays' but how can the Italian coach leave Isco out on this form? Come to think of it how can Vicente Del Bosque leave Isco out on this form. Outstanding. Cristiano Ronaldo wheels away after equalising from the spot with his 16th league goal of the season . James Rodriguez -7 . Madrid's fourth midfield musketeer was involved in that lightning break for the third goal. He will never have Angel Di Maria's energy but he is starting to show that in terms of assists and goals he can match the Argentine. Cristiano Ronaldo - 7 . Not his greatest Clasico by any stretch but he still got his goal from the penalty spot and won the personal duel with Messi hands down. Was unhappy with various refereeing decisions but will be delighted with the way the game turned out. Madrid showed they can win without him putting in an extra-terrestrial performance. Karim Benzema - 8 . Another who was cheered off when substituted. And he deserved it. So often the most criticized of Madrid's BBC forward line, Karim Benzema stepped up in the absence of Gareth Bale to lead the line and get the goal that sealed the win. France international Karim Benzema finished a superb move to give Real Madrid a two goal advantage . Barcelona . Claudio Bravo - 7 . His handling was good and he did not deserve to be on the losing side. Finally conceded his first goals of the season but then none of them could be blamed on him. A decent showing. Dani Alves - 7 . Solid from a veteran of six years of Clasicos. Got forward and covered plenty of ground but his finally delivery often let him down when he got around the back of Real Madrid’s defence. Barcelona defender Gerard Pique is shown a yellow card that led to Real Madrid's equaliser . Gerard Piqué - 7 . Started well holding Barcelona together when Real reacted to conceding the early goal. But then slipped for the penalty that gave them a way back into the game. Barça need to build a defence around him and there are still question marks over whether they have done that with last summer’s signings – Vermaelen still out, and Mathieu shifted to full-back for this one. Javier Mascherano - 6 . The world’s best holding midfielder was back in the centre of defence and struggled against the charge of the white brigade in the second half. Was exposed by the open way that Barcelona played but should be used to that by now. Jeremy Mathieu - 6 . Far stronger defensively than the out of form Jordi Alba who was left on the bench but the Spain international has more in his locker going forward and at times the Frenchman could not make the most of the possession that he had. Barcelona coach Luis Enrique (R) lost his first Clasico as his side fell to their first league defeat . Xavi - 6 . Was the surprise selection in midfield ahead of Ivan Rakitic and for 45 minutes he justified that selection but tired badly in the second half. Still has the ability to keep the ball but people forget how much ground he covered in his pomp - was ultimately over-run and outnumbered by the home side. Sergio Busquets- 7 . Will be under pressure this season as Luis Enrique considers playing Mascherano in front of his defence. Busquets came back into midfield for the Argentine but Barcelona lost the midfield battle. Andres Iniesta - 6 . Disappointing. Was over-powered for the Benzema goal and unable to stop Isco spinning away into space. Barça's midfield trio looked lightweight against Madrid's four, especially when Xavi slowed in the second half. Lionel Messi celebrates with Neymar after the Brazilian opened the scoring after only four minutes . Lionel Messi - 6 . Missed the kind of chance he has spent the last five years scoring with his eyes closed and it was down hill from there. Picked up a first half booking and that seemed to sum up what was an uncharacteristic display. Luis Suarez - 8 . Short of scoring he did everything possible in the first half to put the game beyond Real Madrid. He set up Neymar for the first goal and Messi for what should have been the second. Luis Enrique was asked after the game if he felt he had made a mistake by playing Suarez from the start and he said: 'No, definitely not.' Neymar - 8 . Took his goal brilliantly but failed to last the 90 minutes. Has been around the world on international duty recently and perhaps that showed. Barça needed him to keep carrying the game to Real in the second half but the threat he offered lifted and Carvajal was gradually allowed greater licence to get forward himself.

"Alex McCarthy has no regrets about choosing Barclays Premier League basement boys QPR over Champions League club Liverpool. The Reds  inflicted a last-gasp defeat on QPR last Sunday as McCarthy made his debut and Rangers endured a challenging week as a result of manager Harry Redknapp's public spat with Adel Taarabt over the playmaker's weight. Despite the week's events, McCarthy, who signed from Reading in August, insisted he is happy at Loftus Road as he prepared for Monday's Premier League clash with Aston Villa. Queens Park Rangers goalkeeper Alex McCarthy sealed a move to Loftus Road in the summer . Former Reading custodian McCarthy recently made his QPR debut in their narrow defeat by Liverpool . Brendan Rodgers and Harry Redknapp battled it out to sign the 24-year-old shot stopper during the summer . 'I don't regret the decision I have made up to now,' said the 24-year-old, who worked under Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers when the pair were at Reading. 'Harry was a big part of me coming here. The things he said to me swayed my decision. 'I spoke to both managers and everything the gaffer here said to me I liked, and that's why I'm here now. 'Coming to a new club you want to get your first game under your belt and I'm over the moon to get that first game out of the way. 'The main focus for me now is to keep training hard week in, week out and give the manager a decision to make.' Rob Green has recovered from illness and could displace McCarthy against Villa. McCarthy is happy with the competition provided by the former England goalkeeper as he bids to match his manager's prediction of future international honours. 'I don't know whether I'm playing or not,' he said. 'Me and Greeny have a really good relationship. We respect each other and we train hard and push each other as hard as possible. Whoever is playing, we support each other. McCarthy will have to dislodge Robert Green if he is to become Queens Park Rangers' No 1 . 'You want to play for your country, which would be an amazing feeling and achievement. 'But my main goal is to keep playing week in, week out here and England call-ups will hopefully come along.' The QPR squad have been able to joke about Taarabt's feud with Redknapp this week after the Moroccan dismissed his manager's suggestion he was overweight. McCarthy added: 'We've had a few laughs here and there about it, but Adel doesn't take anything to heart. 'It's nothing to do with me - it's to do with them. The whole team has been focused and it hasn't affected anyone at all. 'He has been out there but he's had an illness the last couple of days so we haven't seen much of him, but when he's been out there he's been good.' QPR have four points this term after beating Sunderland and losing to Stoke and are keen to extend Villa's losing streak of four games to five. 'It's a good time (to play Villa), with the results, how they've been going,' McCarthy added. 'We've been doing everything we can on the training pitch (and) there's a lot of positives to take from last Sunday's game that we can take into Monday's game. 'We've prepared right for Monday and we're looking forward to the game.'","Former Reading goalkeeper Alex McCarthy is happy with his decision to join Queens Park Rangers .

"Manchester United have warned Premier League rivals that their £150million summer spending spree is only the beginning of an ongoing bid to snap up the world’s top talent. The Old Trafford outfit lavished an astonishing £150m over the summer on new six recruits, including a British transfer record £60m deal to land Argentina wing wizard Angel di Maria from Real Madrid and a further £31.5m to prise Luke Shaw away from Southampton. Colombian striker Radamel Falcao also joined from Monaco in a mega-loan deal worth £20m. VIDEO Scroll down for Neil Ashton: Radamel Falcao is obsessed with scoring goals . In the red: But Manchester United can easily afford to pay Radamel Falcao his high wage demands . Spanking new home: Falcao poses outside United's sponsored training ground . Seven heaven: Angel di Maria poses with Louis van Gaal after signing for United in a record £60m deal . The spending spree follows the £65m that former manager David Moyes spent on Juan Mata and Maroune Fellaini during his ill-fated season at the club - and he inherited £15m Wilfried Zaha, making a total transfer spend at Old Trafford of £230m since last summer. But far from putting away the cheque book, sources close to the club say the hunt for further Galacticos will continue, paid for by the expanding commercial revenues generated by the club, described as more than sufficient to fund the current and additional player costs. In the latest full-year accounts released for the club, covering the 2012-13 season, United’s commercial operation pulled in £152.5m. However that figure has grown dramatically, with estimates suggesting that figure will be closer to £190m when the next full-year results - which cover 2013-14 - are released later this month. Accounts covering the current season are expected to show commercial income closer to £240m when they are released next year. As a result, the Old Trafford commercial operation will also allow the club to continue to pay massive wages, comparable with captain Wayne Rooney who earns £300,000 a week.

Party time: But (from left) Javier Hernandez, Ferdinand and Ryan Giggs do not currently play for the club . Cashing in their chips: Mister Potato is United's 'official savoury snack partner' Follow Alex @alexmiller73 . The feeling within the club is that there is still comfortable headroom to comply with the rules of both UEFA’s Financial Fair Play and the Premier League’s Spending Constraints rules. The club’s unprecedented spending spree is being paid for by a number of major deals. According to the club’s official website, the club currently has 29 sponsors and commercial partners. These include the £47m-a-year shirt sponsorship deal with Chevrolet. United’s world-record deal was agreed and signed in 2012 on terms of $559m over seven years, starting this season. Chevrolet has replaced United’s previous deal with Aon, which was worth £20m a year. However, Old Trafford officials negotiated an ongoing £17m-a-year sponsorship deal with Aon that includes their training kit and sponsorship of the Carrington training ground. Local hero: Shinji Kagawa was a popular figure with fans in Japan and was part of a tomato juice campaign . Can-do attitude: Robin van Persie was also used to promote the tomato juice in Asia . Driving force: Sir Alex Ferguson attends a Chevrolet soiree in Shanghai in the summer of 2012 . Delivering even more money: DHL pay United £10m a year to be the club's official logistics partner . Next season will see the start of another record-breaking deal when adidas take over from Nike as the club’s kit provider in an agreement worth a staggering £750m over 10 years, that's £75m a year. The current deal with Nike is worth in the region of £30m a year. The deal with the German’s sportswear giant is understood to contain a clause to cut United’s earnings if they fail to qualify for the Champions League for two consecutive seasons starting in 2015-16. Even if that were to happen United would still bank £55m a year. DHL pays £10m a year for the right to be the club’s official logistics partner. Bwin signed a £2.4m deal with the club in 2012 to become the official Man Utd gaming partner, while Singa pays approximately £2m a year to be the club’s official beer supplier. Meanwhile, despite the promise of further Galactico signings and the surprising decision to sell Danny Welbeck to Arsenal for £16m, the club will continue to invest in local and young talent. Moving on: Danny Welbeck was sold to Arsenal on transfer deadline line for £16m . Promotion: Tyler Blackett (right) has featured for United in their opening Premier League games . Sources close to the club maintain that developing young players is still very much at the core of what the club and manager Louis van Gaal will continue to do. The club point to the fact that four players (James Wilson, Tyler Blackett, Jesse Lingard and Reece James) have been promoted from the youth team into the first team this season, while they have loaned another starlet, Michael Keane, to Burnley until January to gain first-team experience.

"Bath suffered an agonising defeat that could prove terminal to their hopes of qualifying for the Champions Cup knock-out stages as their young tyros were outgunned by a star-studded French outfit. Following last week's embarrassing loss in Glasgow, Bath were desperate to claim their first win of the European campaign but four-times winners Toulouse had an attacking edge that saw them score three tries to one and left Bath having to settle for a losing bonus-point at The Rec. Bath fly-half George Ford, eager to press his case for a starting spot in the forthcoming QBE series, struggled to spark his back-line despite a remarkable set-piece performance from his side's injury-hit pack, which included a hugely impressive first start from 19-year-old academy star Charlie Ewels. Bath fly-half, and England hopeful, George Ford struggled against a powerful Toulouse defence at the Rec . Toulouse's  Maxime Medard holds off George Ford's tackle to cross for the French side in their win over Bath . Toulouse players raise their arms in celebration as Bath's hands go on their heads in disappointment . Bath's European Rugby Champions Cup campaign is now in tatters after two losses in two matches . 'We were that close,' said Bath head coach Mike Ford, who believed his side should have been awarded a penalty in the dying minutes. 'But I'm proud of the guys. They left nothing out on the field. Charlie Ewels is a star of the future.' But without the injured Kyle Eastmond at No 12, and in the face of a world-class Toulouse defence, Bath were unable to break down their opponents until replacement hooker Ross Batty crossed in the 75th minute. Without Eastmond running clever angles off his shoulder, Ford turned the ball over three times in contact as he opted to carry when on other occasions he would have off-loaded. Bath's Ross Batty scores a five-pointer at the Rec during their Champions Cup Pool Four match . Bath's Ollie Deveto gets his left arm free to offload while being tackled by Toulouse's Imanol Harinordoquy . It will not have gone unnoticed by Stuart Lancaster that his second-choice No 10 has not fired on his two outings in Europe this season. At 21, Ford has time on his side and will surely come good. Yesterday Ewels, starting his first game at No 8 having won the Under 20s World Cup as a lock, showed enormous potential against Toulouse's world-class back row, which had the hulking Louis Picamoles anchoring the scrum. Toulouse's Vincent Clerc is driven back in a crunching tackle by Bath's Horacio Agulla . The fact Ewels, only playing because of a horrendous run of back-row injuries,  came out with plenty of credit suggests he has an exciting future. Former England fly-half Toby Flood converted tries by Vincent Clerc and Imanol Harinorduquy, while Luke McAlister converted Maxime Medard's 65th-minute try. Bath centre Jonathan Joseph said: 'It was hard for some of us wider out to get into the game. We weren't quite there today. The fact it was only two points difference showed great character. It's just gutting to lose.' Bath's next game is away to Montpellier on December 6 and with a trip to Toulouse also still on the schedule, the prospects of them qualifying from this pool now look slim.

"Derby's 12-game unbeaten run was brought to an end as they lost 2-1 at home to Wigan, who came from behind to win for the first time since late August thanks to a James McClean brace. The Championship leaders went in front through John Eustace after Jack Butland had saved a James Tavernier penalty, but Wigan substitute McClean struck twice from close range in the second half to end Derby's hopes of a club-record seven consecutive clean sheets. Although Wigan had not won since August 30th, they had drawn their previous four games and there was little in the match until the 31st minute when Roger Espinoza put Callum McManaman in on the left only for Butland to block the midfielder's low drive with his legs. Wigan came back from a goal down to end Derby's impressive run of 12 games unbeaten in all competitions . James McClean (left) celebrates his second goal with James Tavernier, who had missed an earlier penalty . John Eustace celebrates his and Derby's only goal against Wigan alongside team mascot Rammie . It started a good period of possession for the visitors but they were almost caught on the break in the 36th minute when Johnny Russell ran away from two defenders down the right to win a corner that went behind off a Derby player. Another swift attack, this time down the left, created a decent opening for Derby when Jordon Ibe carried the ball across the face of goal before setting up Russell who curled a shot narrowly wide from 20 yards. Russell was involved in a moment of comedy in the 41st minute when he was barged over by Espinoza and crashed into Wigan boss Uwe Rosler, who was knocked off his feet to the great amusement of the Derby fans. Rosler also saw the funny side of it but he was not smiling as the first half ended in dramatic fashion with his side missing a penalty before Derby scored in added time.

Rams striker Chris Martin shows his frustration after missing an opportunity from a free kick . Derby were stunned when referee Robert Madley gave a handball against Eustace just inside the box, but James Tavernier's spot kick was brilliantly saved by Butland diving to his right. Eustace then went down the other end and opened the scoring when he bundled the ball in after Zak Whitbread flicked on a free-kick. Although his team were ahead, head coach Steve McClaren made two changes at half-time, replacing Ibe and Will Hughes with Simon Dawkins and Jeff Hendrick, and the latter almost doubled the lead with a 20-yard shot that Scott Carson could only parry in the 56th minute. Derby Manager Steve McClaren cuts a defeated pose as he watched his side fall to Wigan Athletic . Derby went close again in the 67th minute when Craig Bryson's shot deflected off Hendrick and went just wide, but Wigan equalised two minutes later when Espinoza's low ball from the right was turned in from six yards by McClean. It was the first goal Derby had conceded in 644 minutes and they found themselves trailing seven minutes from time when McClean scored his second of the afternoon from eight yards after Butland could only parry a shot from Adam Forshaw.

"Angel Di Maria and Cesc Fabregas have both enjoyed blistering starts to Premier League life - or rebirth in the case of Fabregas - even if their clubs have had differing fortunes. Di Maria, 26, has been a perpetually bright light in a Manchester United side that has struggled for consistency, while Fabregas’ stylish and energetic displays have helped lift Chelsea three points clear at the top of the table. The form of both, particularly Di Maria, is likely to determine the outcome when their sides meet at Old Trafford on Sunday in an encounter that will pit two of the world’s best midfielders against each other. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail Premier League Preview: Manchester United vs Chelsea . Cesc Fabregas celebrates scoring his first Premier League goal for Chelsea against Crystal Palace last week .

Fabregas crosses the ball into the box during Chelsea's 6-0 win over NK Maribor in the Champions League . Neither player was bought with spare change. At £59.7million, recruited from Real Madrid, Di Maria broke the record British transfer fee and Fabregas was no snip either, at £26.3m from Barcelona. But with so much at stake for both clubs - they could prove to be relative bargain buys. Di Maria, who suffered a knock in Monday night’s 2-2 draw with West Brom, is expected to be fit for Sunday. That will be music to the ears of Louis Van Gaal, who faces the biggest examination of his spell at Old Trafford so far. With the United defence error prone, confidence shorn and likely to be exploited by Chelsea’s world class strike force, Van Gaal’s side will probably have to carve a result from their own attacking brilliance. Thus far, Di Maria has outshone his talented team-mates, Wayne Rooney and Robin Van Persie by contributing three goals and four assists in his six appearances. He has been the focal point of the United attack, creating space for himself in order to feed dangerous balls to his team-mates, as he did when assisting Marouane Fellaini’s brilliant equaliser on Monday.

He is adding sparkle and polish to a unit that has looked a bit dull at times. If he can inspire United to an unlikely victory over Chelsea, he will pay off another hefty installment of his transfer fee. Fabregas, meanwhile, has impressed Jose Mourinho so much he is even hinting that the Spaniard could be a ready successor to John Terry as Blues’ captain. No wonder. Former Arsenal star Fabregas was man of the match on his Chelsea debut against Burnley in August and has propelled his side forward ever since. He has added versatility and attacking vigour that Chelsea were perhaps missing last season, providing more assists than any other player in the league. Undoubtedly one of the world’s best creative players, he could spot a pass while blindfolded and has the deftness of touch to execute it perfectly. Versatile and quick thinking, he not only provides impeccable service to danger man Diego Costa but brings Eden Hazard and Oscar into play. Di Maria avoids the challenge of Graham Dorrans (left) and Andre Wisdom (right) Fabregas (centre) was involved in a bust-up with Palace players after Cesar Azpilicueta was sent off . Fabregas hailed the ‘connection’ between the three of them after they exchanged several passes in the build up to his first league goal of the season against Crystal Palace last week.

"Neil Warnock insists he did not question the referee Craig Pawson’s integrity following Crystal Palace’s home defeat by Chelsea on Saturday, but has been charged by the Football Association. The Crystal Palace boss insists the post-match comments made were focussing on Pawson’s experience rather than his quality, but a statement alleged that Warnock’s comments implied that the official ‘was motivated by bias’. The 65-year-old claimed Pawson wanted to ‘even up’ the teams by sending off Damien Delaney shortly after dismissing Chelsea defender Cesar Azpilicueta. Warnock also claimed Pawson had been ‘influenced’ by a swarm of Chelsea players during the match. Neil Warnock (above) insists his comments did not imply he felt referee Craig Pawson was motivated by bias . Warnock felt Pawson (above) tried to 'even up' the sides in sending off Damian Delaney  after Cesar Azpilicueta . Warnock said on Thursday before the charge that he was expecting a letter, but did not feel he deserved punishment: ‘You are bound to get asked questions. They have one particular person looking at what we say and do, that’s their job. ‘As long as you don’t question their integrity, and I don’t think I did that, I questioned his experience really or the influence of certain things in the game. But not his integrity. We will have to wait and see. I would imagine from what I have been told I will have a letter.’ Despite Warnock’s comments at the weekend, he claimed he has been impressed by the standard of refereeing this season, though admitted he was surprised Pawson, 35, was put in charge of his side’s fixture against Chelsea. He said: ‘I have been absolutely delighted (by the standard of refereeing this season). The referees we have had this season have done really well, it’s surprised me. One or two of the younger ones who have been criticised in the past have done well. Even on Saturday, I think Craig Pawson will be a very good referee in the future. ‘What surprised me a little bit is that a south London derby like that, when we get a young, quite inexperienced Premier League referee, even though he’s a good one. People like Mark Clattenburg have not got a game. It bewilders me if I am honest.’ Warnock says he has generally been impressed by referee standards this season in the Premier League . Warnock contests one of Pawson's decisions on Saturday with fourth official Neil Swarbrick (right) Warnock, meanwhile, has joined the clamour of onlookers criticising the practice of shirt swapping at half-time. Mario Balotelli has been ridiculed for swapping shirts with Real Madrid’s Pepe during Liverpool’s 3-0 defeat against Real Madrid on Wednesday. Warnock said: ‘I am not a massive fan (of shirt swapping). I don’t think I’d fine anyone for it. There is a time and place for it - probably the tunnel at the end of the game. I don’t see any reason for doing it.’ Palace travel to West Brom on Saturday and Warnock does not expect Scott Dann (knee) or James McArthur (hip) to be fit in time. Ahead of the fixture Warnock said this is the most even Premier League he has seen. He said: 'Every game is going to be difficult. I look at Manchester United. Everyone said what easy fixtures they had at the start and they didn’t pull any trees up. I think Manchester City and Chelsea are special but it is more even than it has ever been.'","Neil Warnock charged by The FA for comments on referee Craig Pawson .

"Blackpool hauled themselves off the foot of the Championship - and reminded the division that they will continue to battle through adversity - as they recorded a first win of the season on a highly-charged evening. Hundreds of Blackpool supporters opted to show their disdain at the way in which the club was run, with fans flocking towards the Bloomfield Road concourses beyond the 53rd minute and staging a walkout in protest at the Oyston family’s regime. A plan devised to unnerve their unpopular owners actually served to stir the XI battling for the cause. Eleven minutes after the chanting for chairman Karl Oyston and his father Owen to vacate the club, Blackpool's Francois Zoko waltzed his way into the Cardiff box to score. Francois Zoko (centre right) scored the only goal of the game for Blackpool in their 1-0 win against Cardiff . Blackpool team-mates congratulate Zoko (centre) on his 64th minute striker at Bloomfield Road . Blackpool captain Tony McMahon shows his delight at Zoko's strike for the Championship club . Blackpool: Parish, McMahon, Daniels, Rentmeister, J.Oriol (Dielna 13); Perkins, Lundstram; E.Oriol (Mellis 90+2), Zoko (Ranger 83), Delfouneso; Miller . Subs not used: Milton, Cywka,  Mendy, Zenjov . Booked: McMahon, Ranger . Goal: Zoko 64 . Cardiff: Marshall, Brayford, S. Morrison, Manga, Fabio; Whittingham, Gunnarsson, Ralls (Noone 69), R. Morrison (Le Fondre 69), Pilkington; Jones (Macheda 61) Subs not used: Moore, James, Adeyemi, Maynard . Booked: Fabio, Whittingham . It was fitting that as Zoko twirled away to celebrate his first goal for the club, a banner reading ‘#footballfirst’ - the supporters’ trust’s mantra endorsed by club president Valeri Belokon - was being flourished wildly in a sparsely populated East stand. On the day that Owen insisted the ruling family weren’t thieving from a club to have seen next to no financial strengthening after their Premier League windfall, Blackpool showed they are not robbing a place in the second tier. They possessed heart and a willingness to fight for their manager, Jose Riga, and were the better side against Cardiff, who have been in disarray themselves but not to anywhere near the same level. As home fans left their seats to make a way down towards the pitch screaming ‘You greedy b****** - get out of our club,’ Owen, 80, cut a frail figure in the directors’ box. There was more than just a point these hardy souls wanted to get across - they are trying to effect change. Blackpool fans protested against chairman Karl Oyston ahead of the match against Cardiff City on Friday . Some fans left Bloomfield Road midway through a first half in which both sides failed to break the deadlock . Home fans also flashed the lights on the back of their mobile phones  in another stance against the Oyston's . The hosts felt they should have a penalty in the first half when Fabio (left) tackled Nathan Delfouneso (right) Blackpool striker Ishmael Miller (right) was a menace to the Cardiff defence throughout the match . Whether they will or not remains to be seen, but the smoke bombs, black balloons and consistent songs made sure those who weren’t already aware of their predicament certainly are now. The Seasiders were  the more dangerous throughout the match. Ishmael Miller - a thorn in the away side all night - couldn’t connect with a Tony McMahon centre as the hosts appeared buoyed by the loud and consistent chants for regime change. Nathan Delfouneso felt he ought to have been awarded a penalty just before the half-hour mark, when former Manchester United left back Fabio appeared to sweep his legs from underneath. When you’re rooted to the bottom, these finer decisions tend to go the other way. Edu Oriol - whose twin Joan was forced off injured earlier in the piece - somehow stepped over the ball six yards out when all he had to do was hammer home. Cardiff striker Kenwyne Jones (left) blazed over a great opporunity to give Cardiff the lead in the first half . Cardiff did have their chances too. Sean Morrison might have opened the scoring but headed wide; Kenwyne Jones then skied over the bar from seven yards out, so too Aron Gunnarsson just outside the box. Blackpool equipped themselves well and a significant hat tip must go to the beleaguered Riga for that. The Belgian inherited a squad that lost no fewer than 27 players before pre-season and then found communication with chairman Karl Oyston completely break down over the club's infamous transfer policy. Riga had just eight senior professionals with under a fortnight to go until the opening game of the season. To have six points and be off the bottom at this stage is a minor miracle. Trevor Sinclair, who began his career on the Fylde Coast, told the situation best. ‘It’s unacceptable at this level. For me Riga has done a very good job. He’s got them playing and is starting to turn the tide.’ Blackpool fans staged a mass walkout in the 53rd minute of their team's match against Cardiff . Two fans hold up a sign which reads 'thieves' as they make their way out of Bloomfield Road . Owen Oyston (left) was unmoved as  Blackpool staged their latest protest against the club's ownership . Fabio was cleverly played in by Ravel Morrison but his shot was deflected wide, with John Brayford’s effort from the resulting corner well blocked before the only goal. Then Zoko picked up the ball just outside the box with 64 minutes on the clock. The former Stevenage man drove at the backpedalling Morrison before firing beneath David Marshall. Those who had congregated at the bottom of the Jimmy Armfield stand couldn’t believe what they were seeing. Adam Le Fondre missed a great chance to equalise for the visitors late on at Bloomfield Road . Their hastily-assembled back four - alongside goalkeeper Elliott Parish making his debut at this level - needed to remain firm. Federico Macheda and Anthony Pilkington both had chances, before Delfouneso somehow smashed straight at Marshall from four yards. That miss could have been costly, but it was the Lancashire team’s night after Parish made a super stop to deny substitute Adam Le Fondre and the striker then fired over unmarked. To put this result into perspective, it is Blackpool’s first win in 160 days. Riga will hope for more, and quickly. Perhaps the Oystons are wondering what might have been had they put hands in pockets over the summer.","Blackpool beat Cardiff 1-0 to move off the bottom of the Championship .

"Carlo Ancelotti has ruled out a homecoming for Cristiano Ronaldo at Manchester United, guaranteeing the Portugal star will remain at Real Madrid for the forseeable future. Ronaldo has proved himself as one of football's greatest during five years in Spain since a £80million move, but has suggested in the past that he wouldn't say no to a return to United. However, Ancelotti has rubbished any talk of a prospective move, claiming the Champions League holders need the 'best player in the world' on their side. Cristiano Ronaldo has been in scintillating form at Real Madrid, and he will stay there for many years to come . That is according to Real coach Carlo Ancelotti (left) who has dismissed the interest of Manchester United . Ronaldo was an icon at Manchester United, spending six years at Old Trafford and scoring 84 league goals . 'Everyone can be changed and substituted but Ronaldo is now the best in the world and it means Madrid lose the best player which is a huge loss,' Ancelotti told The Sun. 'But this won't happen. Because Ronaldo will go to the end of his career at Real Madrid. I'm 100 per cent certain he will be here next season not at Manchester United — 100 per cent.' 'He's happy here, he's loved here by everyone. It's a perfect relationship at this moment so I don't think it will change. Ronaldo will finish his career here.' Ronaldo told Sportsmail in September that he would 'love to return to Manchester United one day', while the new manager at Old Trafford Louis van Gaal, also confessed he would like to see a deal happen. But the comments from Ancelotti seem to dispel any hope the United fans might have held. The Italian's new band of Galacticos are back on English soil this week as they face Liverpool at Anfield on Wednesday night. Raheem Sterling could be in action against a side who were reportedly interested in acquiring his services, but the former Chelsea manager has similarly dismissed those reports, too. 'To think of another striker for the Real Madrid attack is really extremely difficult. It's clear that Sterling is not in our plans,' he said.

"It wasn't the most inspired chant you'll ever hear in a football ground, but it was topical and certainly cutting. 'Raheem Sterling, he sleeps when he wants,' sang the Queens Park Rangers fans during the opening minutes at Loftus Road in reference to the 'Tiredgate' affair. And, in the first-half at least, it neatly summarised Liverpool - and Sterling's - slumbering performance. But the most scrutinised and talked-about teenager in the game was certainly alert and awake when it mattered to help the Reds to a much-needed victory late on. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch...

First, Sterling was pretty much in a sleeping position on the turf when he nudged a free-kick short to Glen Johnson after 67 minutes, catching the still-protesting QPR defenders out. The right-back crossed low and dangerously, with Richard Dunne kindly supplying the finishing touch for the 10th own goal of his Premier League life - a most unflattering record. And then, after Eduardo Vargas had brought QPR level with three minutes remaining, it was Sterling who, with trademark acceleration, carried Liverpool forward on the counter. The move culminated with Philippe Coutinho, on as a substitute, curling the ball home to restore Liverpool's lead as the clock ticked over into stoppage time.

Sterling dominated the headlines during the international fortnight after asking England manager Roy Hodgson to leave him out the starting line-up for the Euro 2016 qualifier in Estonia. That chat, and Hodgson's decision to disclose it, sparked endless debate but on the evidence of this sunny afternoon in west London, Sterling is looking not only fresh but on the top of his game. It would be interesting to know Hodgson's thoughts as he sat alongside QPR chief Tony Fernandes and local hero Les Ferdinand high in the stands. He had come to make peace with Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers after the latest unedifying club vs country war of words. Sterling has looked energetic in training all week and it's easily forgotten amid the hubris that he played the last half-hour and made an impact in Tallinn, winning the free-kick from which Wayne Rooney scored the winner. Prior to this match, Sterling had played 1,967 minutes during this calendar year, more than any other player under the age of 21. Burn-out affects even the precocious but Rodgers had no hesitation in throwing him in. 'He felt fantastic to play so I'm looking forward to him getting on and showing how good he is,' said Rodgers on Sky Sports before the match.

At one point, he was outpaced by Karl Henry despite being nearer to a loose ball. It epitomised Liverpool's first-half funk. But he was a changed man and they were a changed team after the break. The tempo was raised, passes were crisper, crosses lethal, as Dunne found to his embarrassment. The game hung in the balance right until the final peep of Phil Dowd's whistle but Sterling made the difference as the best and the brightest players do. 'It's always good to play football, it was no different this week,' he said modestly afterwards.

"Neil Warnock has called on the FA to be more consistent in its treatment of managers, claiming some of his colleagues escape sanction for offences that would land him in trouble. The Crystal Palace manager was on Thursday charged for his stinging criticism of referee Craig Pawson last Saturday, with the FA accusing him of implying ‘the match referee was motivated by bias’. Warnock has insisted that his intention was to question Pawson’s experience and not his integrity, when he said at the weekend that the 35-year-old official had been ‘influenced’ by Chelsea’s players during Palace’s 2-1 defeat.

He said: ‘The only thing I think managers would ask for is consistency, really. There’s been incidents over the last couple of weeks that if it was Neil Warnock, I might have been charged. So you do look from afar and wonder how they arrive at certain aspects of the charges. ‘They have one of two people full-time just looking at comments so they’ve got to earn their wages. I think somebody has to look at what’s said because I think certain comments are out of order. ‘But I have seen managers say things that I thought were way out of order over the last few years and they haven’t had a charge. So it’s difficult to understand how they come about the charges. I don’t think we know really how they do it to this day.’ Warnock added: ‘I don’t think they go after me, I think they look at everything individually. I just think that when I look at the comments people make and don’t get charges, it surprises me and I think if I’d made similar comments, I probably would have got a charge. It’s confusing.’","Neil Warnock heavily criticised the performance of referee Craig Pawson in Crystal Palace's 2-1 defeat against Chelsea last Saturday .

"Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger says his side must be wary of facing another 'big sweat' against Hull City when Barclays Premier League action resumes on Saturday. The Gunners will tackle the team they beat after extra-time in last season's FA Cup final looking to close back up on the top four following defeat away to leaders Chelsea before the international break.

'They could not use (Nikica) Jelavic in the cup last season, and since then they have bought Diame, Hernandez - they have bought some good players. 'When you look at their team sheet now, they look like they can beat anybody so I expect a tough game. 'Look at the quality of players they got in, you can say they bought top quality.' Midfielder Jack Wilshere believes Arsenal cannot afford to drop their guard against a side looking to cement their place in the top flight for a second campaign. 'Hull were a good team last year, but they have improved their squad and have got a year of experience in the Premier League,' the England midfielder said on Arsenal Player.

Defender Laurent Koscielny returned early from the French camp after an Achilles problem flared up again. 'Koscielny finds it difficult to play with it at the moment. You can only trust what the player says, he does not feel ready to play,' said Wenger. 'With an inflammation of an Achilles tendon, if you wait for it to be better, it can be a short time. If you want to get rid of it completely, it is long term. 'We will monitor him and as soon as he can take enough pain again he will play.

"John Terry claimed it was the only remaining question about the title credentials of this Chelsea team: Could they win without Diego Costa? At Crystal Palace came an emphatic response. ‘We are strong as anyone and hungry to win the league,’ said Terry. Like Jose Mourinho, Chelsea’s captain cherishes those victories which demand character as well as class. ‘We showed we have strength in depth by winning without Costa,’ Terry added. ‘That was the one question mark about us. He’s done so well people wondered, if he was out, who could come in and do it? Cesc Fabregas doubled Chelsea's lead at Selhurst Park early in the second half of their Premier League win . Fabregas (centre) scored past Julian Speroni (right) after a neat move involving Oscar . It seems that the Premier League’s penchant for own goals this weekend was contagious. Aleksander Rajcevic scored two own goals to consign NK Maribor, who visit Chelsea tomorrow, to a 2-1 home defeat byCelje in the Slovenian First League. The result meant Maribor slipped to third, six points behind leaders NK Domzale. ‘Loic Remy was very sharp and has looked it in training. We have Didier Drogba and his qualities. The guys are showing maturity away from home. That’s what is needed from us this year.’ With a five-point lead at the top and only two points dropped from eight games, Chelsea must ride out this Costa-less spell if they are to mount a genuine title challenge. It might be different if the Spain striker is ruled out long-term but at the moment it is a question of managing his injured hamstrings, in the hope he will be able to play without fear of a twang. Mourinho has ruled Costa out of the game against Maribor in the Champions League on Tuesday and gives him ‘very little chance’ of starting at Manchester United on Sunday. Like Terry, he was quick to seize on the psychological meaning of the result. Brazilian Oscar's superb free-kick put Chelsea ahead at Selhurst Park on their way to a vital victory . Fabregas (left) celebrates his strike with Oscar - after being assisted by the Brazil midfielder . ‘There is a general feeling our team has improved because of Diego and Fabregas,’ said Mourinho. ‘And it’s right. But, at the same time, this team had big improvement. It was good to have an important victory without the player who has scored so many goals and given us so many points.’ Chelsea had 72 per cent possession against Palace, their highest figure this season and the fifth highest in the Premier League. When they lost at Selhurst Park in March, Mourinho accused his team of lacking ‘balls’, a word he refused to say on camera, so he scribbled it on a reporter’s notepad. After the win on Saturday, he took a pad and grinned as he wrote ‘big balls’. ‘It’s not just about being brave, fighting a lot or coping with a physical match,’ he said. ‘This was about imposing our game. From minute one, we pass and circulate the ball. Control and stability, I like that.’ Oscar and Cesc Fabregas scored either side of red cards for Cesar Azpilicueta, who will miss games against Manchester United, Shrewsbury (in the Capital One Cup) and QPR, and Damien Delaney, now absent for Saturday’s trip to West Bromwich. Fraizer Campbell pulled one back in stoppage-time. John Terry was celebrating his 500th game as Chelsea captain in the win to continue their unbeaten start . Palace boss Neil Warnock, who was in his office with Mourinho before kick-off, watching Manchester City beat Spurs, complained about Chelsea players intimidating referee Craig Pawson. ‘Four or five surrounded him,’ Warnock said. ‘I think they influenced things. It’s not an even platform.’ Jose Mourinho called Cesc Fabregas’ goal ‘scandalous’. Here’s why. 17 Passes involved in the build-up that swept from end to end. 8 Players involved in the move. Only Gary Cahill and Thibaut Courtois did not touch it and Cesar Azpilicueta had been sent off. 9 Total touches by Fabregas. Chelsea’s sublime goals were underpinned by a ruthlessness to rekindle memories of the first team Mourinho built at Stamford Bridge, a decade ago. ‘We are reaching that level,’ Mourinho agreed. Others in the camp detect it, too, including Terry, who captained the club for the 500th time. There have been plenty of scrapes in the 12 years since he took the armband, but it was hard to fault his performance at Selhurst Park. ‘To be captain after all these years is a great achievement,’ said Terry. ‘There will be a day when I have to hand it someone else and hang up the boots. But I’m feeling great, playing well in a very good side and we’re aiming for trophies.’ Terry admits the only question mark over Chelsea had been their capability of winning without Diego Costa . VIDEO Mourinho pleased with team evolution . 'Craig Pawson clearly upset Neil Warnock but to be fair to him, pretty much every referee does that. 'It started when Pawson, in keeping with current trends, chose not to caution Damien Delaney for his first tackle, which was a poor one. 'To be consistent he let John Terry escape with a similarly poor tackle because it was also his first. 'There can be no argument about Cesar Azpilicueta’s red card for a shocking tackle on Mile Jedinak, nor the first of Delaney’s yellow cards — he had been given his chance. 'His silly challenge on Loic Remy then gave the Chelsea players the chance to pressurise the inexperienced Pawson into levelling things up to 10 men a side, which he duly did.'","Cesc Fabregas scored a superb goal for Chelsea at Crystal Palace .

"Boxing icon Carl Froch admitted he was close to tears after being made a Freeman of his home city of Nottingham on Thursday night. The WBA and IBF world super-middleweight champion joined sporting legends Brian Clough and Torvill and Dean in receiving the honour. Froch, who wore a purple suit by Sir Paul Smith, another Freeman of Nottingham, was handed an official scroll by Nottingham City Council leader Jim Collins in front of 2,000 fans at the Royal Concert Hall in Nottingham. Carl Froch holds the scroll in front of statue of legendary football manager Brian Clough . The 37-year-old told the Nottingham Post: 'I'm in the process of having a cabinet built at my house and I will put the scroll in with my world title belts. 'People say 'well what does the Freeman of the city give you?' It's not about that. It's about what it symbolises. And, for me, it symbolises an acknowledgement from my wonderful city which is proud of my achievements. 'I could cry if I carried on talking about it – it means that much to me. Froch was handed an official scroll by Nottingham City Council leader Jim Collins (left) WBA and IBF world super-middleweight champion Froch also had a tram named after him . 'But there was one thing I had to do before the night was over and that was to have my picture taken with the Brian Clough statue with the scroll in my hand. 'What a man and what he legend he is. That picture will mark the day as such a special occasion and will go in with the scroll and my world title belts.' Earlier, Froch has admitted he is ready to call time on his glittering career if the WBA and IBF world super-middleweight champion is denied his dream fight against Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr. The 37-year-old wants a showdown against the Mexican in the boxing capital of Las Vegas to complete his career bucket list. Froch may have thrown his last punch if he's denied showdown with Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr . Talks have taken place over a multi-million pound fight early in 2015 but Chavez appears reluctant to face the Nottingham fighter, who does not want to take on another British challenger at this late stage in his career. Froch told Sky Sports: 'That's where I am on it. I've told that to Eddie Hearn. 'He said 'you can't do that' and you know what I can, because if that right hand I threw that connected with George Groves' chin in front of 80,000 people at the national stadium - if that's the last punch I throw in my career, I will still be smiling.' James DeGale, who takes on Marco Antonio Periban on November 22, is the IBF mandatory challenger to Froch, but the fight does not hold much appeal to Froch. Froch is not keen on another British showdown against IBF mandatory challenge James DeGale (right) He added: 'I don't need to risk putting my legacy at stake for another British pretender who's not earned his stripes and without giving James DeGale any stick - he's an Olympic gold medalist, he's done well - he's not quite earned his stripes, but he's mandatory for the IBF belt. 'Do I fight him? Do I take him seriously? Yes, but if the Chavez fight can happen in Vegas for me, that is the one. 'If the Chavez fight doesn't happen, there's a strong chance of me retiring a happy man.'","WBA and IBF world super-middleweight champion Carl Froch recognised as a sporting giant by his home city .

"The lack of Diego Costa handed Dominic Solanke the opportunity to make the bench for the first time in his Chelsea career. But what do we know about the 17-year-old? Sportsmail takes a look. Who is he? Solanke is one in a crop of bright youngsters coming through the ranks at Stamford Bridge and ought to make some sort of impact on the first team sooner rather than later. A pacey striker, his goals fired the Blues to an FA Youth Cup trophy last season and scored consecutive hat-tricks in the competition. Solanke actually only turned 17 a month ago but has already played for the club’s Under 21s and in the UEFA Youth League. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Solanke's brace + late winner as England beat Belgium U17s 2-1 . Chelsea youngsters Nathan Ake (left) and Dominic Solanke (right) arrive at Selhurst Park for the match . What’s he done before? He has been at the club since 2004 and Chelsea have paid close attention to his development, which has increased rapidly over the past year. He scored 18 goals while leading the line for the academy side last year and his sharpness in front of goal means Mourinho has no qualms in throwing the teenager into the first team squad. Why do I recognise his name? This might be why. ‘My conscience tells me that if, for example, [Lewis] Baker, [Izzy] Brown, and Solanke are not national team players in a few years, I should blame myself,’ said Mourinho in the summer. A real ringing endorsement, but with it comes a touch of added pressure. He has recently signed a three-year deal with the league leaders. Serious faith in his ability. Jose Mourinho said that if Solanke was not a senior England player in a few years he would blame himself . Is he English? Very much so. Solanke scored the winner for England’s Under 18s against Holland last month and - should he start playing games in the cup for Chelsea or go out on loan - can’t be far away from Gareth Southgate’s Under 21s. A word of warning, though. Solanke is eligible to play for Nigeria - his dad’s country of birth. Is he more a Drogba or Remy? Certainly more in the mould of Loic Remy in that he’s quick over five yards and can leave defenders for dead given the chance to run at them. But he is well-built for his age and appears to have the muscle needed to make a fist of senior football sooner rather than later.

"Harry Redknapp struggled to explain exactly what role Les Ferdinand would play at Queens Park Rangers following his appointment as head of football operations. Ferdinand, a former QPR striker, was confirmed into his new role last week - a job that is understood to be similar to that of a director of football. Redknapp has, in the past, openly admitted he could not work under a director of football. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . QPR manager Harry Redknapp (R) talks with new Head of Football Operations Les Ferdinand during training . Redknapp struggled to explain exactly what Ferdinand's role at Loftus Road would involve . Speaking in 2012, Redknapp said: 'It’s something that happens abroad – they have sporting directors and they choose the players but I couldn’t work under those circumstances.' And on Friday, Redknapp insisted the decision to bring Ferdinand to Loftus Road was down to owner Tony Fernandes, though admitted he was consulted about the appointment. Furthermore, when asked to explain what Ferdinand's job description was, Redknapp broke into a long silence before saying: 'Erm, I love Les, I get on great with Les. Ferdinand has been described as an 'icon' by Redknapp for his goal scoring exploits at the club . Hoops owner Tony Fernandes was responsible for bringing in Ferdinand . 'I’ve got a lot of time for Les. He’s just looking at the youth set-up and everything else. 'Tony wanted to bring him in. He’s an iconic figure at the club, he was a top player here.

I speak to Les all the time, I’ve just had a cup of tea with him. 'I knew he was coming. The chairman asked me what I thought about Les and I said ""I love him"". Great lad.' Redknapp was due to have dinner with Fernandes ahead of Sundays clash against Liverpool. But Redknapp insisted he would not be seeking any assurances from the Malaysian businessman during Friday's meeting as uncertainty over his future persists. A heavy defeat against Brendan Rodgers' side on Saturday would raise further question marks over his role at QPR, particularly after plans to offer him a new two-year contract were shelved by the club. Former England manager Glen Hoddle (C) has also been added to QPR's backroom staff . Redknapp insists he doe not fear losing his job, despite Tim Sherwood being mooted as a replacement . But Redknapp insists he is losing little sleep over his job prospects, saying: 'Will I beg Tony not to sack me at dinner? No. I wouldn’t beg anybody to do that. 'I'm not going to be there buying him dinner to keep my job - I will let him buy dinner! I don’t feel I’m under any pressure here. I don’t lie in bed at night worrying about. On his new contract, he added: 'I wasn't bothered about signing a new contract. What are contracts? If you get the sack, you get whatever you get. Contracts mean nothing.

"Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has revealed the freak injury Mesut Ozil picked up against Chelsea was merely from passing the ball with the outside of his left foot. Ozil faces around two months of rehabilitation after scans on international duty with Germany discovered a 'partial rupture of the outer band of the left knee joint' which he suffered during the Gunners clash at Stamford Bridge. Wenger said on the injury: '(Do) you know how Ozil did the injury? Passing the ball with the outside of his left foot. He must have done that a million times. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Arsenal v Hull Premier League preview . Mesut Ozil heard a crack in his left knee during the first half of Arsenal's clash against Chelsea . Ozil could be until 2015 after suffering a ruptured left knee injury against Chelsea .

He told me he just wanted to give the ball like that (flicked with the outside of his foot) and heard a little crack.' Wenger insists the German's knee problem is just the latest in a long line of 'coincidental injuries' rather than down to any failing in the club's medical support. He also allayed any suggestions he went against the advice of both the player and Arsenal's own medical staff by sending Ozil out for the second half at Stamford Bridge on October 5, as his side looked to get back into a match they would go on to lose 2-0. Arsenal recruited Germany's former head fitness coach Shad Forsythe to help the current backroom team. Wenger, however, maintained there could have been no way to forsee another injury setback after forward Olivier Giroud fractured a bone in his foot when making a last-minute tackle against Everton, and then France defender Mathieu Debuchy caught his studs in the Emirates Stadium pitch which resulted in a broken ankle. 'What is different (this season) is we have a bit more prevention than before for the players to prepare for the competition, and I think we have made progress,' said Wenger. Wenger has been overseeing training with a reduced squad due to the injury problems the club have . Mesut Ozil - knee injury- up to three months . Olivier Giroud - ankle - three months . Mathieu Debuchy - ankle - two months . Laurent Koscielny - achilles - three weeks . Aaron Ramsey - hamstring - two weeks . Yaya Sanogo - hamstring - Close to return . Mikel Arteta - calf strain - Close to return . Serge Gnabry - knee - Close to return . Theo Walcott - knee - Close to return . Nacho Monreal - back - Close to return . '(But) for us this season, we had big injuries and coincidental injuries. 'For example Giroud - I don't know what we can do about Giroud's injury? Debuchy was on his own when he did the ankle, then you have Ozil. 'There are a lot of post-World Cup injuries and not many soft tissue injuries.' Ozil is not expected to feature again for Arsenal until the start of 2015. Wenger, though, stressed there should be no concerns over how the player was managed at Stamford Bridge. 'He (Ozil) did not tell me anything during the game, I did not even know,' said Wenger, whose side tackle Hull on Saturday looking to close back ground on the top four. 'What happened was that at half-time, just before we went out, the physio told me 'Ozil has a little pain with his knee, but it is not bad'. 'He wanted to go on and I told him 'if you don't feel well, tell me and I will take you off straight away'. He never did that during the whole game, and after that I left him on because we were in a position where we needed to score a goal and he can deliver the final ball. 'Then after the game, he went to Germany. With Germany, they thought at the start it was nothing. 'We played on Sunday, on Monday he was off, and on Tuesday they gave him the day off. He was supposed to practise on Wednesday. Ozil took a lot of criticism for an abject performance on the left wing as Arsenal lost 2-0 at Chelsea . 'On Wednesday morning, he said he could still not practise. 'They sent him for a scan, and in this scan they discovered that he had a knee ligament injury which is quite serious.' Defender Laurent Koscielny is not available because of an inflamed achilles. Winger Theo Walcott is set to play for the club's Under-21s on Friday after nine months out with a knee injury, while captain Mikel Arteta could feature against Hull after a calf problem. Midfielder Aaron Ramsey is expected to be back for next week's Champions League tie away to Anderlecht in Brussels.

"Jose Mourinho claims he was approached to take over as Paris Saint-Germain manager twice - including being the 'first choice' for the job ahead of Carlo Ancelotti in December 2011. The Chelsea boss revealed he rejected the chance to leave the Spanish capital for the French equivalent during the season he went on to lift the La Liga title with Real Madrid. And Mourinho also expects PSG to win the Champions League at some point soon, stating a final between the French champions and his current side Chelsea would be 'fantastic'. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Raphael Varane control a long pass with a brilliant backheel . Jose Mourinho reveals he was approached twice to take over as manager of Paris Saint-Germain . The Portuguese says he was approached as 'first choice' ahead of Carlo Ancelotti in December 2011 . The 51-year-old told Telefoot on Sunday: 'I knew about the project (at PSG) even before it began. I was Leonardo’s first choice (ahead of Ancelotti). 'And when Carlo left (in 2013), they made me another offer. I have rejected them twice. 'I thought a lot about it. But the first time, there was Real Madrid and the second time there was Chelsea. 'The club has an enormous amount of quality, Laurent Blanc is a good manager, Al-Khelaifi a good President.

"Philippe Senderos has heard all the snide comments down the years – but believes since his summer move to Aston Villa he’s now hitting the peak of his performance. The 29-year-old Swiss international centre half has had a career that has seen him play in three World Cups as well as the top Leagues in England, Spain and Italy. Yet he’s never quite shaken off the reputation from his early Arsenal days which saw some cruel fans dub him ‘Ponderos’. Philippe Senderos has shrugged off his early critics as the defender believes he's on form at Aston Villa . Senderos will resume a promising partnership with skipper Ron Vlaar at Queens Park Rangers on Monday night and says he’s worked out that the only critic who matters is himself. He said: ‘I think every player at our level deserves respect and credit for what they do – you cannot get to the Premier League and stay there for a long time without hard work and dedication. ‘Maybe when I was younger these things would worry me, but now I know what I have done in my career so I don’t let other people’s opinions affect my performances. ‘It isn’t about my pride, or needing to get praise to feel good about myself. ‘I know what I am on the pitch. I know what I am good at and what I have to work on. Nobody is ever the finished article, but you need hunger to get better and to give your maximum and I have got that.’ Senderos will resume a promising partnership with Ron Vlaar at Queens Park Rangers on Monday night .

Villa conceded only one goal in the three games they played before the Dutch World Cup star got injured and Senderos says he’s looking forward to resuming the partnership at the heart of defence. He said: ‘We hit it off immediately – outside football we have the same mentality and on the pitch we are very similar too. ‘These things sometimes just click. We don’t need to talk too much to know 100 per cent what the other is thinking. ‘Ron is right up there with the best defenders – a top, top player. He was one of the best at the World Cup and is one of the best in the Premier League. ‘We’ve had a tough run of games, but we have to remember what we did well at the start of the season and maintain the belief.’ Senderos during his time with Arsene Wenger's Arsenal, where supporters dubbed him ‘Ponderos’","Philippe Senderos believes he's on form since summer move to Aston Villa .

Theo Walcott came through a full training session on Monday and is set to play for the U21 side on Friday . Walcott, taunting Tottenham fans as he is stretchered off with a knee injury, hasn't played since January . The England midfielder tries to get the better of Per Mertesacker in training as he prepares to return to action . The England star is unlikely to feature in the Gunners' Premier League clash against Hull on Saturday, however. He could make the bench next Wednesday for the away Champions League tie against Anderlecht. Walcott’s imminent return will be a relief for Wenger as his injury list continues to grow. Arsenal have recently lost Aaron Ramsey to a hamstring injury and record signing Mesut Ozil to a knee injury, which could keep him out of action until the New Year. Meanwhile striker Olivier Giroud is still out of action since breaking his foot against Everton In August. Arsenal boss Wenger has praised the attitude of Walcott  having battled back from a serious knee injury . Mesut Ozil heard a crack in his left knee during the first half at Chelsea, and could be out until the New Year . Wenger is also facing a defensive crisis ahead of Hull’s visit on Saturday as centre-back Laurent Koscielny is out for three weeks with an achilles injury, Mathieu Debuchy remains on the sidelines with an ankle complaint and Calum Chambers is suspended. The Arsenal manager insists it is just a coincidence: ‘You cannot say our injuries are preparation mistakes. The big injuries we have are really accidental. ‘Scientifically we are quite good. We have been hit hard after seven games. I would never have thought we would have had so many bad injuries. ‘I am not a great believer in coincidences but this time it really is coincidence.’ Giroud (right) suffered a broken foot against Everton and is also expected to be out until early next year .","England forward will play against Blackburn U-21's having not played since suffering a knee ligament injury against Tottenham in January .

"Unbeatable, unbreakable, perhaps even unstoppable. Whatever mix of mojo and moxie Hearts have working for them this season, it’s clearly effective. And maybe just a little bit supernatural. Alim Ozturk’s stupendous strike to secure a dramatic late draw from Sunday's Edinburgh derby at Easter Road certainly looked to have a touch of the magical about it. His 35-yard belt — into a two-club headwind, mind — dipped drastically to crash in off the underside of the bar at the last moment. Hibernian's players celebrate taking the lead against Hearts thanks to a goal from striker Dominique Malonga . Callum Paterson of Hearts was shown a red card for this challenge on Hibs goalscorer Malonga . But Alim Ozturk (above) rescued a point for Hearts with a late long range strike in a dramatic ending . One of the best goals ever scored in this fixture, the unexpected injury-time intervention earned 10-man Hearts a reprieve from a game that Hibs should have won. If that sounds like a familiar scenario to anyone with even a passing interest in this rivalry, the home side are absolved of any great blame for the loss of two points here. Sure, they might have killed this game off when 1-0 up against a side reduced in numbers by Callum Paterson’s deserved red card. Ahead through a Dominique Malonga goal just before half-time, they created chances to bury Hearts. But one of the great strengths of the visitors, who extended their unbeaten start to this season to 11 games, has been in finding a way — however unlikely — to take something when nothing appears likely. On this occasion, a Dutch-born Turkish centre-half’s unstoppable thunderbolt from the stratosphere saw them move one point further clear at the top of the table. A side-effect of a moment that created absolute bedlam in the away end, as Hearts supporters — who had filled their allocation — revelled in the glory of another enjoyable derby day. Robbie Neilson's (above) Hearts side are unbeaten and six points clear atop the Scottish Championship . Alan Stubbs' (above) Hibernian team are 14 points behind rivals and leaders Hearts after today's draw . ‘Time for Action. If Not Now, When?’ demanded the bill posters stuck to lamp posts the length of Easter Road by Hands On Hibs activists for this match day. Although their cri de coeur is aimed at rallying supporters in protest against the club’s board, the words might easily have been applied to the position of the team. Starting the day outside of the top four, a daunting 14 points adrift of the visiting leaders, Alan Stubbs’ men surely had to eke out more than just a draw from this second derby of the season. The comeback had to start here. They certainly looked like the more adept footballing side from the outset, with midfielders Scott Allan and Scott Robertson excelling in a diamond formation. They appeared to have enough guile to create openings, even if Malonga and Jason Cummings seemed determined to pass up chances to score. Perhaps predictably on a day of gusting gales, the two best early chances came as a result of mistakes, Malonga flicking the ball wide after Danny Wilson had dawdled, then been robbed by Cummings, while Soufian El Hassnaoui shot straight at keeper Mark Oxley after Hibs defender Paul Hanlon had allowed the ball to bounce over his head. Rangers manager Ally McCoist (top left) was watching title rivals Hearts in action against Hibernian . Osman Sow of Hearts (left) tries to protect the ball from Paul Hanlow (right) of Hibernian . Proceedings were predictably error-strewn, although Mogaro Gomis for Hearts and home midfielder Robertson looked capable of bringing a touch of composure to play, while Hibs also boasted one of the more clever players in Allan. The opener came from an Allan corner one minute before half-time, French-born Congolese striker Malonga eventually firing the ball into the roof of the net after Liam Fontaine and Cummings had both seen efforts blocked. Remarkably, this was the first time Hearts had trailed in a league game all season. Now we would find out something about the men who had begun to make this Championship lark look so easy. They did not quite assert themselves with aplomb after the break, the tempo and direct running of Hibs continuing to unsettle the visitors. Indeed, Malonga came close to making it 2-0 early in the second half, flashing his header from an Allan cross just wide. Allan himself did wonderfully to shrug aside Prince Buaben and tear towards the box moments later, the Hearts man clipping his opponent’s heels inches outside the box to concede a free-kick that, half a breath later, would have been a penalty. Even as Hibs were flying in the final third, though, their own penalty area resembled a panic-stricken war zone. Cross after cross seemed capable of undoing all their good work, the ball being allowed to bounce far too often. Malonga celebrates putting Hibernian into the lead in the first half with a close range strike on 44 minutes . The introduction of Jamie Walker added something to Hearts, the winger taking just seconds to get into the fray, drilling a low cross through the legs of Lewis Stevenson and forcing Oxley to do well to deny Paterson. The loss of skipper Wilson to injury soon after didn’t seem to disrupt Hearts too greatly, Buaben coming close to an equaliser as he stormed into the box and clipped a right-footed effort just past the far post. When Paterson was then rightly red-carded for a wild, desperate, high, cynical and undoubtedly dangerous challenge on the fast-breaking Malonga after 78 minutes, though, even the most optimistic of Hearts fans must have feared the worst; they ended the game with a back three of Buaben, Gomis and Ozturk. Cummings missed another good chance, this time with a header, to seal a Hibs victory. The suspicion lingered that, somehow, something would happen to punish the home team. Ozturk's brilliant effort in the last moments, which went in off the underside of the bar, brought Hearts level . Oztruk's goal was celebrated wildly by the Hearts fans who had made the short journey to Easer Road . Step forward Ozturk, a player whose longest of long-rangers would have been accompanied by cut-off cries of indignant protest from Hearts fans, management and team-mates — possibly even members of his own family — wondering what on earth he was doing, chancing his luck from that distance... oh, right. Jings! It is telling that, while the boiling mass of maroon in the away end, prompted by the goal, was still in full eruption long after the final whistle, Hibs were actually applauded off the park, the home crowd recognising their contribution to a day of high drama. The Hibees are vastly improved from the team who surrendered their Premiership place so meekly and, all things being equal, they should certainly feature in the promotion race. Hearts? Still leading. Still setting a blistering pace. Still carrying with them an air of invincibility that is beginning to get almost spooky.","Alim Ozturk's thunderous 40-yard in injury time saves Hearts a point .

"Pull on the white shirt for the Under 21s at a major finals and get international experience of competing for a trophy? Or take a holiday and return in time for a shirt-selling operation in the Middle East or the United States? We all know the answer. Will Arsene Wenger give his blessing for Jack Wilshere, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Calum Chambers and others to join up with England's junior team at the end of this season, or focus on his team-sheet for the next money-spinning global tour? Brendan Rodgers will no doubt take Liverpool to glad-hand their Boston-based owners some time before the start of next season and would rather have Raheem Sterling along to show his dazzling smile. Raheem Sterling, pictured in action against San Marino, is eligible to play for England Under 21s next summer . Ross Barkley (left) and Jack Wilshere (right) are two more senior players who still qualify for the Under 21s . Gareth Southgate has led his England Under 21 side to the European Championship in the Czech Republic . Calum Chambers has moved quickly into Roy Hodgson's senior England squad after signing for Arsenal . Everton will insist on some rest for Ross Barkley (currently resting while injured) and John Stones (currently resting while injured), Phil Jones will need a break from helping Manchester United defend while most of his team-mates attack and the rest will find something better to do. Like the talented Jonjo Shelvey, who has made it clear that Under 21 football is not for him. Speak to senior figures at the FA and they will tell you that agents do not want their clients 'stepping back' into the Under 21s for fear of damaging their brand in the money-dash world that is the Premier League. Under 21 football has long been the place to avoid and the caps nobody wants. Gareth Southgate has set about changing those attitudes and Luke Shaw's performances in the last two games suggest he is making progress. Shaw limped off in his previous game for Manchester United but declared himself fit for duty. Well done to him. The senior team, however, still robbed Southgate of Chambers, promoting him for matches against San Marino and Estonia — and that sent out the wrong message. Luke Shaw (left) was in England's World Cup squad but went into the Under 21s to face Croatia twice . England Under 21s line up ahead of their 2-1 second leg play-off win against Croatia in Vinkovci . A look at the team fielded against Croatia on Tuesday (right) and a possible starting XI for next summer (left) Norwich City's Nathan Redmond (right) impressed during the Young Lions' second leg victory in Croatia . Players born on or after January 1, 1992 are eligible to participate in the 2015 European Under-21 Championship. This means that some players - such as Jack Wilshere - will be 23 by the time of the tournament. Yet these players are allowed to play because they were aged 21 or under when the qualification process began. Southgate is a sensible, intelligent football man. He has guided the Under 21 team into the European Championship finals, where they lost all three games last time. Now they have won 10 games in succession, with players who are not regulars with their clubs, and won their play-off with home and away 2-1 wins against a threatening Croatia. He is not a coach who wants to add to Roy Hodgson's problems and will take what he is given. He also believes in the unity of the group who have taken England this far and doesn't want 'outsiders'. But he should still have the chance to pick the best team he can. The seniors are strolling through a pathetically weak qualifying group that is doing nothing to arrest dwindling interest in the national team. Imagine if a strong Under 21 team won their first trophy since 1984? Holders Spain are out, so are Holland. There are still dangerous opponents, but this might help to reverse a trend of suffocating failure. This might be the breakthrough we have been looking for. Many of Roy Hodgson's young England squad would benefit from competitive internationals next summer . John Stones (left) and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain could be part of an extremely strong England Under 21 XI . Swansea's Jonjo Shelvey was reluctant to go back to the Under 21s after tasting senior action for England . The squad would become familiar with the pressures of tournament football before the senior European Championship in France the following summer, when others such as Wayne Rooney, Joe Hart and Theo Walcott would be along to boost the average age. With the next two World Cups at venues unlikely to suit the English travel sickness, the next Euros in France are the biggest chance of progress. Why not look to start the winning habit now? Burn-out needs to be given thought, but few of the players we are talking about will go the distance with their clubs. Barkley, for instance, is carefully managed by Roberto Martinez. Oxlade-Chamberlain is not an Arsenal regular, Shaw and Chambers must still impress their club managers, despite costing a combined £40million-plus. It would be a terrible shame if an opportunity of success was lost because the selfish heavyweight Premier League clubs come out on top again. This is England's time.","Some England players have shown a reluctance to play for the Under 21s .

"Former Sunderland striker Ally McCoist admits he knows just how the miserable the Black Cats are feeling at the moment. The Rangers manager was part of Alan Durban's side hammered 8-0 by Watford in September 1982 - the last time the club had shipped eight goals before last Saturday's humiliating defeat at Southampton. The former Scotland frontman has more reason the most of his team-mates to feel guilty after wasting two easy chances in that Vicarage Road clash with the game still goalless. Rangers manager Ally McCoist can sympathise with the current Sunderland players after being part of the Black Cats' side who lost 8-0 at Vicarage Road against Watford back in September 1982 . But his side recovered from that devastating defeat to finish 16th in the old 22-team First Division and McCoist hopes Gus Poyet's side can also battle their way out of relegation trouble. McCoist, who scored just eight league goals in two seasons on Wearside, said: 'My memories of that one is that I should have put Sunderland 2-0 up before the eight goals we lost that day. 'It was one of my worst days ever in football down at Vicarage Road. 'They had a proper team at that time. They had John Barnes and Nigel Callaghan and I think Luther Blissett was playing as well that day. 'It was horrendous - my worst ever defeat - so I can sympathise totally with what the Sunderland boys went through last week. 'We had a good group of boys and responded well. We certainly stayed in the division that year. Sunderland goalkeeper Vito Mannone sunk to the floor after conceding against Southampton . 'But I can remember the feeling in the dressing room after that game. It was like there'd been a death in the family. 'Being a Sunderland man, and I've still got my season tickets down there, hopefully they can bounce back.' Sunderland players have offered to refund fans who travelled down to the south coast for last weekend's St Mary's disaster. But McCoist admits that was never an option for his side, saying: 'I'm not sure we were as financially well looked after as the lads are nowadays to have done that. 'But if today's team do that it would be a fantastic gesture because they are a wonderful support town there.' Sunderland were humbled 8-0 by Southampton at St Mary's last weekend and McCoist can sympathise .","Sunderland lost 8-0 to Southampton at St Mary's last weekend .

"Dave King vowed to continue the fight for control of Rangers on Thursday night as he broke his silence on the £16million bail-out put forward by his alliance of investors. The South Africa-based businessman has flown home from the UK without an agreement in place but is adamant that doesn't mean his plan is dead. King expressed frustration with aspects of the process since arriving in the UK to meet Ibrox directors nine days ago. Dave King (centre) is still yet to broker a deal for him to take control of a 51 per cent stake at Rangers . Rangers striker Nicky Clark in action during the Ibrox side's cup win at East Fife on Tuesday night . Chief among those has been Mike Ashley — regarded as the main rival for the Ibrox throne — snubbing a request for talks. King questioned Ashley's motives as he alluded to reports the Newcastle United owner had sought control over Rangers trademarks during previous discussions about a loan. The former club director held talks with Sandy Easdale on Wednesday but did not reach an accord with the man who holds voting rights over a 26 per cent stake in the club, providing the power of veto over a new share issue. However, King provided Easdale with further information about his group's plan yesterday and insisted he would not back off. 'We have a lot of work to do over the next few months to regain the club,' he said. 'I would not be here without the support of the fans and neither would my co-investors. We are going to need to draw on your support again over the coming months.' He added: 'Over the last few weeks Paul Murray, George Letham and I have constructively engaged the Rangers board and (at the request of the board) Sandy Easdale regarding our proposal to invest £16million into the club as soon as is practically possible. 'When investing in any public company, there are numerous regulatory and compliance requirements that have to be dealt with. There are also SFA compliance issues that arise when investing in a football club in Scotland. Mike Ashley (centre), seen here pictured at Newcastle's game against Leicester, has snubbed any request for talks with King so far over owning a percentage of the Ibrox club . 'An obvious further complication in Rangers' case is the seeming lack of authority of the board to make decisions without reference to key shareholders who appear to be 'the power behind the throne'. 'Prior to commencing the implementation issues referred to above, it is necessary to reach an in-principle agreement with the board that can then be put to shareholders. 'In this regard, it is important to recognise that the so-called Easdale Block represents more than 25 per cent of the shares in issue and could therefore block the implementation of our proposal even if recommended by the board. 'Likewise, a combination of other shareholders could veto our proposal. I attempted to meet with Mr Ashley on my visit but neither he, nor his colleague, Mr [Keith] Bishop, acknowledged my request for a meeting. This is their right but it is unfortunate given the concerns from supporters that Mr Ashley is using his shareholder status to put pressure on the board to alienate the rights and trademark of the club in favour of his personal interest. 'I will make a separate announcement and appeal to fans on this topic at the appropriate time.' Sportsmail revealed earlier this month that the King group were planning a £16million investment in return for a 51 per cent stake acquired via a new share issue. Sandy Easdale (left) has held discussions with King over his 26 per cent stake at the club . That initial proposal has been modified to contain a loan element that addresses the fact the club may run out of cash before any share issue could take place. The cash input, however, will only happen if the King group gain effective control of the boardroom. 'Our initial proposal to the board was to invest the full £16million by way of equity at 20p per share,' said King. 'The board requested that we consider a debt/equity mix that would reduce dilution for existing shareholders and allow the debt component to be advanced prior to the extended time frame required for the approval of additional equity. 'We are amenable to this and to working with the board on the mechanics necessary to ensure that this is achieved, provided the full investment is recognised by way of board representation. 'We wish to appoint an equal number of members to the board and have the key say regarding the appointment of the chairperson. 'We will not invest funds and let the existing board determine how these funds are spent. That has not worked well in the past. 'The board has apparently engaged constructively on our proposal while advancing its own points as to what it believes is in the best interest of the club and its shareholders. 'Sandy Easdale has similarly apparently engaged constructively, including highlighting some concerns. I have today responded to these concerns in writing.'","The fight for control continues to be a huge topic of debate at Rangers .

"Maybe one day, when his dotage is upon him, Ronny Deila will reflect on this night as the moment it all changed for him as the manager of Celtic. In seeing off a decent but hardly dynamic Romanian side, the Norwegian took the old wisdom that you’d rather be lucky than good to the extreme. His side were far from good here, barely even mediocre. Yet, crucially, they won. And with the door to the knock-out stages of the Europa League now wide open, the man who succeeded Neil Lennon  three months ago now has more than hope to cling to. Stefan Scepovic (3rd from right) opens the scoring for the home side in the 73rd minute with a close-range header .

Goals: Enache 81' Booked: Yahaya, Oros . Referee: Kristinn Jakobsson . Deila spoke before the game of the need to build momentum, to aim not just to win their next game and make it four wins in a row, but to claim 10 successive victories. Statistically, they remain on course for such an achievement but frankly the whipping boys of Group D - Astra are bottom with no points - will long wonder why they didn’t puncture that hope. The central Europeans found Celtic in the most generous of moods here. It took Deila’s side long enough to create anything of real substance but even when they did they were wasteful. At times Stefan Scepovic's finishing was so poor that he must have wished that a hole would open up in the centre circle into which he could crawl. Yet to the Serb’s credit, he didn’t stop trying. He was rewarded with his first goal in a Celtic shirt which laid the foundation for the most unconvincing of victories. Stefan Johansen had the Parkhead crowd rubbing their eyes in disbelief by claiming a second soon after but Astra at least made their hosts sweat for the win with a consolation through Gabriel Enache. Celtic got over the line but the free-flowing football Deila speaks of must materialize soon. After three months of agonising over his team selection, the manager finally stumbled across a scenario that presented few dilemmas. Fresh from a thumping of Ross County on Saturday, the Norwegian’s only minor concern was who would fill the ineligible John Guidetti’s boots but Scepovic was always the front-runner for that task.

The hosts' captain Scott Brown manages to evade the challenges of Giurgiu's Vasileios Pliatsikas (left) and  Laban . Scepovic rises highest to connect with a header from a few yards out that cannoned in off the crossbar . The Serbian forward slides on the Parkhead turf to celebrate his opening goal for Celtic on Thursday night . On the kind of Glasgow night that would have ducks seeking shelter, the closure of the upper-tier was a constant reminder of how bland a serving the Europa League is when the taste of the Champions League is still lingering on the palate. What a difference an early goal would have made to the subdued atmosphere and what a chance Charlie Mulgrew passed up to claim it just five minutes in. Picked out superbly by Anthony Stokes’ deep corner, the midfielder was granted the freedom of Parkhead by the Romanians. But his header didn’t remotely concern Silviu Lung in the Astra goal. Seidu Yahaya was one of two Astra players who almost failed to make the trip due to visa problems yet there was no excusing the lateness of his arrival to challenge Mikael Lustig deep in his own half, the result, a deserved caution for catching the Swede on the ankle. With just one win in their last eight games, Astra’s policy of keeping 10 men behind the ball when possible was understandable. Yet Celtic’s inability to make any headway from open play in the opening quarter of the game was stark. Johansen slots home his side's second goal of the game after Silviu Lung spilt Aleksandar Tonev's cross . And, having kept the Scots at arm’s length for long enough, Oleg Protasov’s side began to jab. What Craig Gordon knew of Yahaya’s venomous, dipping volley from 20 yards out, only he truly knows. The fact the ball thundered off the keeper’s chest suggested his save was more down to a stroke of good fortune than anything else. There was no mystery about Gordon’s next involvement just seconds later. Astra skipper Constantin Budescu stole half a yard on a static defence and looked certain to sweep the visitors ahead until the keeper’s outstretched leg foiled him. At this stage in the game, Celtic’s defence was something of a misnomer. When William Amorim prodded a short pass between Virgil van Dijk and Jason Denayer, they were in different postcodes. Its recipient, Takayuki Seto, rightfully chastised himself for firing a gilt-edged chance weakly beyond the far post. When Lustig’s whipped cross almost forced Vasileios Pliatsikas into a spectacular own-goal, Celtic Park briefly threatened to find its voice again. Yet Charlie Mulgrew’s kamikaze pass across his own box to Gabriel Enache seconds later drew more groans. On 38 minutes, Scepovic failed to connect cleanly with Lustig’s cross leaving Lung again unworked from a header. However, the Serb did tee up Stokes with the last action of the first half only for the Irishman to be thwarted by a timely block by Pliatsikas. That late flurry did nothing to shelter Deila’s men from a chorus of jeers as they traipsed back up the tunnel to reflect on a display described by Parkhead icon Chris Sutton as ‘pathetic’. The Norwegian midfielder Johansen salutes the crowd after his strike that ultimately proved to be the matchwinner . After the break, Mulgrew was again at fault with a wayward pass from deep that resulted in Seto catching sight of the whites of Gordon’s eyes. Only Emilio Izaguirre’s late intervention stopped a certain goal. Then, twice in quick succession Scepovic latched onto excellent crosses from Lustig and Izaguirre no more than six yards out. Both opportunities were missed with the only debate surrounding which one was the more glaring. Aleksandar Tonev was sprung from the bench to replace Callum McGregor just before the hour mark and rippled the side-netting with an ambitious strike.Wakaso soon joined him with Mulgrew unsurprisingly making way. Astra understandably began to fancy their chances. Gordon remained rooted to the spot when Junior Morais sent a long throw into the box and Cristian Oros headed just over. Yet, just as the notion crossed the mind that a solitary point might not be a disaster for Deila, his side seized all three in a remarkable five-minute burst. Wakaso won the crucial free-kick on the left flank on 73 minutes that also cost Oros a booking. Stokes’ pin-point delivery arrowed towards Scepovic and the Serb felt the weight of the world rise from his shoulders as his towering header beat Lung. Having laboured all night, Celtic were pinching themselves just five minutes later with the arrival of the second. The hitherto solid Lung spilled Tonev’s routine cross straight into the path of Johansen and the Norwegian gleefully rattled the loose ball high into the net from 12 yards. Deila’s was only allowed two moments of relative calm, though. Enache appeared to use his arm to finish off a scrappy move but the arrears were halved nonetheless and it was a nervous last 10 minutes for his side. Neither Beram Kayal, Celtic’s final substitute, nor Scepovic could put the home fans out of their misery as they squandered late chances but they hung on. Just.

"Dave King held talks with influential Rangers shareholder Sandy Easdale on Wednesday as he attempts to advance a £16million bail-out plan for the club. The South African-based businessman is heading an alliance of potential investors offering substantial financial input in return for control via a new share issue. Easdale’s position is significant as he currently holds voting rights for 26 per cent of existing shares. That provides an effective power of veto over the King group plan, as a new share issue would require the backing of 75 per cent of existing shareholders at an AGM. Dave King, pictured in Glasgow earlier this year, held talks with Sandy Easdale on Wednesday . Neither party made any comment  after they attempted to address numerous issues in their telephone discussion, but King is expected to release a statement on Thursday. The Castlemilk-born tycoon is hoping to reach an agreement-in-principle with the Ibrox board before he returns to Johannesburg, although it remains to be seen if that will be possible. King is working in conjunction with other individuals including former director Paul Murray and shareholder George Letham, who loaned the club £1m in emergency funding earlier this year. It’s believed another loan could form part of the new package the group has put forward, with the aim of providing a financial bridge to the AGM. Rangers need for cash is pressing, with doubts about the ability to meet the December, or possibly even November, wage bill. That means the club would likely run out of money before any income arrives from a new share issue. Rangers director Sandy Easdale (left) with brother James (right) and chief executive Graham Wallace during a match in Forfar in January . The situation is further complicated by the fact club accounts should be signed off ahead of an AGM. However, auditors Deloitte need to see a clear picture of the financial future before doing so. Formal agreement over a loan plus equity deal could be the answer, but it’s thought the King group would only agree to offering a loan if assured they will gain the 75-per-cent backing required for their larger investment plan. Should that proposal flounder then a loan from Mike Ashley would seem the likely alternative source of funding for the club. Ashley recently increased his Rangers shareholding to 8.9 per cent and has requested an EGM to remove chief executive Graham Wallace and ally Philip Nash from the board. The Newcastle United owner is thought to have been in talks over a loan prior to last month’s stop-gap £3.13m share offer, but those discussions reportedly broke down when Ashley wanted club trademark rights included in the deal.

"Sunday marks Louis van Gaal's first real test since he took over as the manager of Manchester United. In the absence of Champions League football, he has avoided meeting any of the leading European clubs. And incredibly, given United's poor start to the season, they have not played any of last season's top four in the Premier League yet. Of course, that's all about to change with Sunday's game against Chelsea, the derby at Manchester City next month and a visit to Arsenal in four weeks. By then we'll know if the small signs of improvement recently at United are genuine. Although they are looking better offensively than last season, it is not the United of old yet. You used to fear that red tide of players coming at you at Old Trafford and I haven't seen that under Van Gaal. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Manchester United's Daley Blind (centre) celebrates scoring a late equaliser against West Brom . Chelsea players including Filipe Luis, Didier Drogba and Oscar celebrate the Ivorian's goal against Maribor . Radamel Falcao is still finding his feet at United after joining on loan from Monaco in the summer . Plenty has been said about Cesc Fabregas's passing but there's a part of his game that has been overlooked and which is just as important to Chelsea. That's the runs he makes for his team-mates on the overlap to get beyond the player in possession and provide an option in a position which hurts the opposition. He'll go round the outside of his team-mate, bursting a gut to do it, and create a chance just by the timing of his run. Some players can do that 12 times in a game and never affect it. But he can smell the opportunities in the final third, when it's right to go and better to stay. He reads the situation so well, his timing is perfect and he knows when it's going to hurt. On at least five occasions this season I've seen him do it to create a goal. Fabregas might have signed for United last year. Today may be the day they regret missing out on him. He has the players to do it. Even with Wayne Rooney suspended, there's Robin van Persie, Radamel Falcao, Juan Mata, Angel di Maria and Adnan Januzaj with Marouane Fellaini coming into contention after his goal and performance in the second half at West Brom. But so far they haven't been as aggressive or ruthless as Sir Alex Ferguson's teams. That's what I'm waiting to see from them today. Given United don't really have the players to be cautious, it would not surprise me if Van Gaal goes with a diamond formation, with two up front, so he can get Van Persie, Falcao, Di Maria and Mata into the team. With Diego Costa very doubtful and Loic Remy injured, Chelsea may have to start with Didier Drogba or Andre Schurrle up front, and if they do, this is United's opportunity to take the game to Chelsea. Sunday will give us a good idea just how good this United team can be, because Chelsea have a back four and a midfield that can soak up pressure, deal with crosses and cope with neat football being played in front of them. When you look at Jose Mourinho's record away from home in big games, he often likes to counter attack. If Costa and Remy are out, that will make him more inclined to play that way. And with a five-point lead, he can afford to play it cagey and look to break on United. Eden Hazard, pictured in action against Maribor, could be key to Chelsea's counter-attacking style . Jose Mourinho (left) and Louis van Gaal (right) will go head-to-head at Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon . Marcos Rojo (left), pictured tussling with Saido Berahino (right), will need to be at the top of his game . United's Achilles heel is obviously their defence. Should Drogba play, even at the age of 36, you could imagine him bullying their centre-halves, especially Phil Jones. But Jones can't allow that to happen. At 22 years of age, he's no longer an inexperienced player and he must dominate a centre-forward, even someone like Drogba. If Van Gaal chooses the diamond formation, United will have to be extremely co-ordinated behind the front two to defend, especially given the width Chelsea could have in Eden Hazard, Schurrle — if he's playing wide — or Willian. At the moment with United, you feel 75 per cent of their game is focused on how to play well going forward. With the defence it feels as though it's a case of: 'We'll play a back four and hope they can cope with it.' In between games, Van Gaal will obviously be working hard to remedy that and drilling their defensive shape. But Mourinho's teams are the masters at exploiting space on the break and with Oscar, Hazard and Cesc Fabregas they have the ideal players to do that. Juan Mata, pictured in action against QPR, looks set to start in the absence of the suspended Wayne Rooney . Ex-Chelsea midfielder Mata (right) will have a point to prove against his former boss Jose Mourinho (left) Mata pumps his fist after scoring in United's 4-0 win against QPR at Old Trafford in September . Daley Blind has a key job to do in shielding the defence. He's a lovely distributor of the ball, he keeps his passing very simple but he has a screening job to do, too. But Di Maria, Ander Herrera and Mata have their part to play as well. The whole team will have to work as a unit and for Mata, playing against the manager who sold him a year ago, it's an opportunity to prove a point. You would imagine that part of the reason why Mourinho was willing to sell him was his weakness in contributing to defensive duties, so the Spaniard will not lack motivation. There is a lot more to come from him. He's a talented player but so far he hasn't found the consistency he had at Chelsea in his first two seasons. There are great performances in him but they have been few and far between at United. I'm intrigued as to how it plays out. Given the make-up of the teams I'm expecting goals rather than a tight game. When the two biggest personalities managing in the Premier League collide, you would be right to expect something special.

Sakho scored his seventh goal in seven consecutive games and has become such an instant hero at Upton Park that West Ham are ready to offer him an improved contract. He was substituted to a standing ovation in the last minute and Allardyce later revealed he was struggling with a damaged shoulder. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Goalscorer Diafra Sakho gives  fans the thumbs up but later had to be substituted with a shoulder injury . Sakho celebrates scoring West Ham's second goal in the 2-1 win against Man City with Cheikhou Kouyate . West Ham manager Sam Allardyce admits it is a worry that his leading goalscorer was forced off the field . ‘For me, my big worry is that my leading goalscorer came off with a shoulder problem,’ said Allardyce. ‘I just sincerely hope that damage is not severe and that he can carry on because when you have someone who scores six in six [in the league] you can ill afford to lose him and if we lose him that will be a big blow. Sakho has been sensational since his £3.5million switch from Metz in the summer, and even though he agreed a four-year, £20,000-a-week deal when he joined, co-owner David Sullivan wants to reward his form with a revised contract.

"For Celtic fans analysing Ronny Deila’s six years in charge of Stromsgodset, the devil very much lies in the detail. When the Norwegian bid farewell to the team from the small city of Drammen in June, he did so with a Premier League title to his name, the first in 43 years at the club. A remarkable ending to a sporting fairytale, if ever there was one. That feat – which led to Deila being elevated to a kind of footballing demi-God in his homeland – was all the more remarkable in that it did not come courtesy of an oligarch’s deep pockets. Celtic manager Ronny Deila speaks during a press conference ahead of Thursday's Europa League match . Deila succeeded because he was allowed a free rein to do as he saw fit and was backed by a board with unshakable belief in his methods. They also indulged him with time. Lots of it. His first two years in the post were spent fighting relegation before it suddenly all clicked into place. And there, for Celtic fans, is the rub. Glasgow is not a place which welcomes project managers with open arms. Tangible signs of progress are best to be seen yesterday. For Deila, the opening four months of his journey at Celtic have proven to be bitty and uncertain. Doubtless not helped by injuries to a string of internationals, the Norwegian has nonetheless failed to convince the court of public opinion. And yet, ahead of four successive home matches over three competitions against Astra, Kilmarnock, Partick Thistle and Inverness, he feels more certain than ever before that his grand plan is about to take root. ‘I think, in the last month, things are happening,’ he declared. ‘I think we are going in the right way and I think the players are starting to get confidence. ‘I can see in training that we are starting to get some relations and patterns in the attacking play. We are better in the transition defensively and we haven’t conceded many chances or goals. So I think confidence is coming into the boys and we are starting to get a good team and I hope to show that against Astra. Deila watches on during training at Lennoxtown on Wednesday ahead of the European tie . ‘If you take the games since the last (international) break, we have had some good results and also created more and had a better team. Now with the players coming back I trust the team even more. We seem a competitive and strong team.’ Even allowing for Ross County’s lowly position in the league, there was something indisputably impressive about the way Deila’s side swatted the Highlanders aside on Saturday. In that regard, it’s hard to understate the significance of the fact that the influential John Guidetti is ineligible for tonight’s game. Stefan Scepovic, the only player for whom Deila has thus far paid hard cash, is likely to be trusted with the main striking role. The Serb has much to prove. But, in keeping with his theme of individual and collective improvement, Deila believes his No 9 is now primed and ready to repay some of the £2.3million invested in him. ‘He is very hungry to play and he wants to show himself,’ he said. ‘He came on against Ross County and had a good chance there and you can see in his eyes he wants to improve. He is a good player. I’ve seen him score some fantastic goals in training this week. I’m looking forward to seeing more from him on the pitch.’ Celtic striker Stefan Scepovic (centre) is put through his paces during training on Wednesday . Asked if the player has been physically building himself up over the past month, Deila quipped: ‘Yeah but we don’t we take any drugs so it takes more time! ‘It’s not only two or three times in the gym and you are there, it takes maybe half a year to get the strength we want. But he’s working all the time. It’s also about mentality. Against Ross County he kept the defender working, his touch was good, so he has to go on from there.’ If it’s taking Deila some time to figure out Scepovic, no such allowances have to be made for Stefan Johansen. An integral part of Stromgodset’s title-winning team before being signed by Neil Lennon, the Norwegian has curiously looked ill at ease in the deep-lying role Deila has sporadically played him in. Yet, in a more advanced role in Dingwall, he was a revelation. Point made, surely? ‘We have different options,’ Deila replied. ‘That’s good, it’s what I want. I don’t want to stick to one system. We want to look at an opponent and pick the right system against them. We have played 4-2-3-1 and 4-3-3 and we’ll see what we do tomorrow. Celtic captain Scott Brown (left) speaks with team-mate Leigh Griffiths during training . ‘We’ve also played 4-4-2. It’s important that it’s not about systems, it’s about principles and the principles are getting the full-backs forwards, the wingers coming in, triangles on the sides, getting crosses, getting people into the box. You can see that more now and hopefully we can get even better.’ We’ve been here before under Deila, of course. The green shoots of progress stamped on by another flat, demoralising defeat. Three wins on the bounce have only been recorded once this season. Sooner rather than later, he needs a run of results. A body of work he can point to as incontrovertible evidence that the project is coming good. ‘I haven’t seen that statistic but I want more than four, I want to have 10,’ he stated. ‘The goals are very clear and that’s what we’re fighting for. What I have experienced here is that you have to take one game at a time, you need to focus on one and give that all your energy. ‘We did that well against Ross County, we were mentally ready and had won the game after 30 minutes. That has to give the boys confidence and that’s what we want on the pitch tomorrow as well. Get good control of the game and get the tempo up and try to finish as quick as possible.’ What he’d give for a maximum return from the back-to-back games against the Romanians. Ten points might not quite have Celtic over the qualification line (depending on how the Salzburg-Dinamo games go) but they would provide considerable shelter from whatever storms winter throws his way. Celtic's Europa League opponents FC Astra train at Celtic Park on Wednesday evening . ‘That is the goal - to get through - and that will be hard because there are good teams there,’ he stressed. ‘It looks like a battle between three teams and Astra are one of the teams we have to beat. If we do that, we are in a very good situation in the group. ‘If we get (back) to the Champions League we have to be even better again so I think the Europa League is very important to get experience and to play together as a team, to get the new players used to European football. ‘We have a new team and a new style of play and I think the European matches have been very important for us. We have played 10 different games now in Europe, when you take the pre-season games as well, and I don’t remember one game where we had control. ‘We want to go and control more games, especially at home, and play attractive football. I would like also like what you saw from Scotland against Poland, against European opponents. To play high quality games because the Europa League is high quality.’","Ronny Deila has had an uncertain first four months in charge at Celtic .

"Celtic boss Ronny Deila has cleared Lukasz Zaluska of all blame after the Polish goalkeeper was allegedly assaulted in the street by another Scottish Premiership player on Monday night. Zaluska had been out for a meal with his wife and a friend in Glasgow’s fashionable West End when the incident is said to have occurred. And on Wednesday night Dundee United released a statement revealing they have commenced an internal investigation into the conduct of two of their players following information received by the club. They refused to make any further comment. Goalkeeper Lukasz Zaluska, sporting a black eye, is put through his paces in training earlier this week . The Polish keeper was pictured with a woolly hat over the wounded eye ahead of Thursday's match . Despite being taken to hospital for medical attention after suffering facial bruising, the 32-year-old trained at Lennoxtown this week and is set to take his place in the squad which faces Romanians Astra Giurgiu in the Europa League at Parkhead on Thursday. Speaking about the matter before the Tannadice club’s statement was released, Deila said he had no issue whatsoever with his player socialising on the night in question. And the Norwegian was convinced his player had absolutely no reason to reproach himself for anything that had happened. ‘He is fine,’ Deila declared. ‘Of course he was a bit scared about this but everything is good now. He has trained well the last couple of days, so he is ready for tomorrow. ‘I talked to him, of course, about what happened. It is a police case now, I hope they can make it right and we just have to wait and see. Celtic boss Ronny Deila has cleared  Zaluska of all blame after he was allegedly assaulted in the street . Celtic goalkeepers  Zaluska (left) and Craig Gordon keep warm during a brisk session earlier this week . ‘He hasn’t done anything wrong from our perspective. We just have to support him and, of course, we feel sorry for him because that is a hard thing to go through.’ Deila has taken a hard-line approach to the fitness and diet of his players since being unveiled as Celtic manager. But he was adamant yesterday that he has no issue whatsoever with any of his players socialising when their training schedule permits. ‘It is not a problem if they want to go out for dinner and do something social,’ he added. ‘Of course that is okay. He hasn’t done anything wrong. He was out for dinner and that is perfectly right. That’s why you get frightened about this, it’s not fun to experience things like that and we have to take care of him. ‘If this was happening a lot of times, I would have to do something but I think this is a one-time situation, hopefully. You learn by experiences. Kris Commons, who missed the league win over Ross County, remains doubtful through injury . ‘You have to understand the life that you have in that city. They (the players) are role models and that is important to think about - but it is a police case and we will see what happens.’ Craig Gordon is likely to retain his place in goal, with full-back Emilio Izaguirre also in contention despite being stretchered off in the 5-0 victory against Ross County last Saturday following a challenge by Michael Gardyne. But Kris Commons, who missed the league victory in the Highlands, is still doubtful through injury. Astra have failed to take a point from their opening games with Dinamo Zagreb and Red Bull Salzburg and there is a growing expectation that Celtic could go on to top their group if they secure two wins from the double header to hit the 10-point mark. However, boss Deila insisted that the side who finished second in their domestic league last season, and knocked Lyon out of the Europa League on their way to a place in Group D, should not be taken lightly. ‘They would be in the top three teams in Scotland,’ he stressed. ‘They are not a bad team. ‘The richest man in Romania has them and I played against them in January (when he was boss of Stromsgodset in the Copa del Sol tournament) and they have some quality players there. ‘But if you look at the group, you see that they don’t have any points yet and that is a sign they may be a little bit weaker than Salzburg and Zagreb but those two teams are very good.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","The Polish keeper was allegedly assaulted by another Premiership player .

"Stuart Hall's bid to regain his world title ended in failure after a thrilling toe-to-toe clash with Randy Caballero in Monte Carlo. The Darlington bantamweight displayed his trademark grit and determination in the principality but was eventually undone by the American's class. And at just 24, the Salle des etoiles crowd may have witnessed the unearthing of a new star in Caballero as he won on all three scorecards. Stuart Hall's (right) bid to regain his world title ended in defeat against Randy Caballero (left) Hall falls to the floor during the IBF Bantamweight world champsionship fight at the Salle des etoiles . Hall, 10 years his opponent's senior, won the IBF title four days before last Christmas with a battling performance against Vusi Malinga in Leeds. His first defence, against Martin Ward, was a non-event after Ward was cut in the second round and the fight ruled a technical draw. Hall, who spent his youth in Ibiza before turning his life around, was aggrieved when Butler was awarded a split-decision victory in Newcastle in June. But the new champion immediately vacated to return to super-featherweight, leaving the title vacant. Caballero, backed by the powerful Golden Boy promotional outfit and with an impressive amateur pedigree, had won his first 21 fights as a professional with 12 of his last 13 opponents bringing winning records to the table. And the first round set the tone for the rest of the fight as neither man let up during a fast and furious opening three minutes. But it was the Californian who stamped his authority in the second session, flooring Hall with a straight left. He recovered well, however, and the pair spent the remainder of the round head to head like rival stags. After another three minutes that could have been fought out in a cupboard under the stairs, Caballero took a step back in the fourth stanza, found his range and punctured Hall's defence. Hall showed a flicker of recovery in the 10th session but was unable to land a knockout blow on Caballero . The Brit then let his frustrations get the better of him in the fifth, slamming his right hand into Caballero's groin, leaving him writhing around on the canvas in pain. But Hall had his best spell of the fight as it reached the halfway point, a spell of pressure late in the session enough to halt his slide. Neither man was showing signs of tiring and although the smaller of the two, Caballero was more than matching Hall in the strength department. And the longer the fight went on, the more his quality began to tell. Boxing at range, he let his hands go before slipping off, leaving Hall grasping at thin air. Even when he was dragged into a dog fight, Caballero more than held his own. Hall showed a flicker of a recovery in the 10th session but he quickly returned to the back foot and must surely have realised by now that he needed a knockout to regain his title. Not that Caballero's winning position meant he took his foot off the pedal in the last round, however, as both men served up a finale worthy of the fight's opulent setting. The judges are all in agreement after the final bell with scores of 116-11 twice and 118-110.","Stuart Hall's world title bid ends in defeat to Randy Caballero .

I can walk slowly with a foot brace on but it is painful, an effort. 'I have to intentionally force my left leg to move. Every step I take on my left foot is a conscious effort. For me to walk 100 metres is a real effort. 'But I will definitely complete the Great North Run. 'Even if I don't get any better than I am now, I will be doing it. Even if I have to walk 13 miles, I will do it. 'Even if I have to force my left leg to walk every step, I will do it because I am stubborn like that. There is nothing that can stop me. Moore pictured here in his boxing pomp - on the left in 2003 and on the right in 2007 after winning the British light-middleweight title bout . 'My goal will be to do it for the kids at Niamh's Next Step. A lot of young children get Neuroblastoma and it is a horrible, aggressive form of cancer. 'These kids go through hell trying to get rid of it and going though chemotherapy. That will be my driving force. 'So firstly, the aim is to get myself right physically and to the point where I can do it, and when it is hurting and getting difficult my driving force will be to do it for the kids who have Neuroblastoma to give them maybe a better life before their lives are taken away, or to give them a better rehabilitation.' To give an idea of how difficult Moore still finds walking, he was left in agony when he agreed to take his nine-year-old son Mikey sightseeing in London last weekend. The 35-year-old says nothing will stop him competing in the famous Great North Run next year . He recalled: 'I was working in the corner for Ricky Boylan's fight, and my son had never been to London before. 'He said, ""Will you take me for a walk around London?"" For me to walk 100 metres is a real effort, but I will do anything for him. 'So I took him on the Underground, into Piccadilly Circus, and it absolutely killed me. 'It was so painful but I wanted to do it for him. It didn't matter how much pain I was in. 'People think I am better than I actually am, but I am far from better and it is going to take a long, long while.' *You can sponsor Jamie Moore to do the Great North Run next September at justgiving.com/JamieMoore777 . *Listen to the full interview on the Latch and Halina Weekend Hangover Show on Fubar Radio on Saturday between 10am and 12pm.","Retired boxer Jamie Moore was shot in case of mistaken identity in August .

"The new Miss America says there are more important things for people to worry about than her little red cup. That was the message Monday from Kira Kazantsev, of New York, as some social media users panned her use of a plastic cup during the talent portion of Sunday night's pageant finale in Atlantic City. Miss Kazantsev, 23, told The Associated Press she realizes everything she does now will be scrutinized and commented on. But she says she performed Pharrell Williams' Happy while tapping a cup on the floor because that's what she wanted to do, regardless of what anyone else might think. Scroll down for video . Miss America 2015: Kira Kazantsev poses for photographers during the traditional toe dip in the Atlantic Ocean in Atlantic City, New Jersey . 'There are so many more important issues in this world that people should be worried about than my plastic cup,' she said Monday morning after taking the traditional dip in the Atlantic City surf the morning after winning the crown. 'However, as Miss America, everything I do is scrutinized and I understand that. That's part of the job. 'I hope people understand that's just part of who I am, and I wanted to present myself that way I wanted to,' she said. Her pageant causes include eliminating sexual assaults in the military, and preventing domestic violence. The Hofstra University graduate plans to attend law school with the $50,000 scholarship she won in the pageant. Making waves: Miss Kazantsev said there are more important issues for people to worry about than her red cup performance, which was panned on social media . Fake tan fail? Miss Kazantsev's overly bronzed feet looked darker than the rest of her sun-kissed skin . Photo op: Miss Kazantsev walks with police officers toward the beach for the traditional toe dip in the Atlantic Ocean . Miss Kazantsev said her talent portion was inspired by the 2012 movie Pitch Perfect, in which Anna Kendrick's character auditions for an a cappella group by performing rhythmically with a cup. Bathed in midmorning sunshine Monday on the Atlantic City beach, Miss Kazantsev showed off her sun-kissed glow - and her especially tan feet. Though beauty pageant contestants are known for their liberal use of bronzing products, Miss Kazantsev seemed to have had a self-tanning mishap as she frolicked on the beach filming a number of video promos in which she asked fans to follow her on sites including Twitter, Instagram and Facebook. Yet those sites continued to send forth disapproval from many users over her choice of material for the talent portion, with many users deriding it as lightweight and silly.

Some social media users were even more virulently critical of last year's winner, Nina Davuluri, the first Indian-American to win the crown, directing racist taunts at her. Miss Kazantsev is not particularly concerned with the online reaction to her own performance. 'It's unconventional; and sometimes people aren't as open to change as some would like,' she said. 'It's just something different and I hope people take it as a positive. If they can appreciate that and be happy with what I did, then that's all I can ask.'","Kira Kazantsev revealed why she chose to use a plastic cup during the talent portion of Sunday night's pageant finale in Atlantic City .

"Almost two years ago, Martin Murray fought on the undercard of Ricky Hatton's ill-fated comeback in Manchester. Standing in the way of a world title shot against Sergio Martinez was Jorge Navarro, an unbeaten but limited Venezuelan. In the end, the 27-year-old offered little resistance, going down in the first and sixth rounds before the fight was stopped before it reached the halfway point. Martin Murray goes through his final preparations for Saturday's fight in Monte Carlo . Now Murray, who went on to lose narrowly to Martinez in Buenos Airies the following April, is in a similar position. This time the prize on the table is a shot at the much-feared and much-avoided world champion Gennady Golovkin. In Monte Carlo on Saturday night, Murray faces Domenico Spada in the final fight of his current deal with South Africa-based promoter Golden Gloves. The Italian, who brings a record of 39 victories from 44 contests, is as wily as he is tough and will be no gimme for the St Helens man. Stopped just once by recent Golovkin victim Marco Antonio Rubio, Spada is awkward, even underhand at times, but has promised he is in the principality to win. ‘He’s experienced,’ said Murray. ‘His style is horrible and awkward but it works for him. You look at videos of him and think he looks very beatable. He looks like he’s got nothing about him. The venue in Monte Carlo for Murray's middleweight bout against Domenico Spada . ‘But then you look at his record and look at the people he has fought and beat and you start to realise that he makes his style work for him.’ Spada took former world champion Darren Barker the 12-round distance three years ago in a European title fight and did the same to Sebastian Zbik in their two battles. Murray will know, however, that if he can’t navigate a way past the veteran, he has no right to share a ring with Golovkin. The Kazakh will be ringside at the Salle des etoiles following his 18th consecutive stoppage victory over Rubio in Los Angeles last weekend. And he is penciled in to return to Monaco on February 21 for what will be his third visit. ‘People talk about Golovkin and you’ve got to answer questions about it, but the more people I get asking me about it, the more I get motivated to do a proper job on Spada this Saturday night,’ said Murray. Murray must navigate a way past the veteran Spada if he is to secure a shot at Gennady Golovkin (left) ‘I knew I had a world title shot against Sergio Martinez back in 2013, but I still had to go out there and beat Jorge Navarro to get it. It’s the same on Saturday. If I don’t beat Spada, there’s no world title fight. ‘For that reason, I’m completely focused on Spada and am not thinking about Golovkin one bit. In fact, I didn’t even watch his fight against Marco Antonio Rubio at the weekend. I just completely ignored it. Instead, I stuck on a DVD of Spada that morning to keep me focused.’ Murray’s defeat to Martinez was his second unsuccessful world title challenge following his contentious draw with Felix Sturm in 2011. The 32-year-old middleweight fought just four times over the following two years, eventually breaking ties with Hatton to sign a seven-figure, three-fight deal with Golden Gloves. A stoppage win over Ishmael Tetteh and a wide points win over Max Bursak have helped build much-needed momentum. ‘I wouldn’t have been ready for a world title shot this year,’ added Murray. ‘But I feel like I’m just getting into my prime and I can beat any middleweight in the world.’ First, he must take care of Spada. For now, Golovkin can wait.","Martin Murray takes on Domenico Spada in Monte Carlo on Saturday night .

Something tells me that by the end of the year, I'll be world champion. I would turn over every man, woman and child to get that belt. And I want to fight again soon. I want to get straight back in there.' In the co-main event, Gunnar Nelson maintained his unbeaten record after a patient display against Zak Cummings. After a tactical opening five minutes, Nelson took the Texan down before executing the rare naked choke 12 seconds before the end of the second round. The Icelander, who does the bulk of his training in Dublin, said: 'This was a tough fight. Zak is a very tough opponent. He is strong everywhere and he knows what he is doing. The atmosphere out there was something else. I have never felt like that in the Octagon. The crowd was so loud and so intense - it is a different feeling.

Brad Pickett's hopes of earning himself a title shot were dashed when he was beaten by Ian McCall. Pickett, in his second fight at flyweight, was outworked over three rounds. The Londoner said: 'I am disappointed obviously. I am a very competitive person and I hate losing. I'm just disappointed with how the fight went. I thought I won the first round but I knew he won the last two because I just couldn't catch him. 'I was chasing more and more but I left myself open. I came down to flyweight for a reason - to get a title shot. Obviously that is out of the window now. The natural move for me now is to go back up a weight division again.'

"It's the longest-running feud in the Premier League... but where did it start? Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has apologised for his touchline clash with Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho during the 2-0 loss at Stamford Bridge. Wenger and Mourinho were involved in a touchline spat during the London derby which saw the Frenchman shove the Portuguese, as well as the pair exchange choice words. The 64-year-old Frenchman initially defended his actions in the aftermath of the game and claimed he had 'nothing to apologise for', but he has taken to French TV to reveal he 'regrets' the incident. VIDEO Scroll down to watch  Mourinho say he did not provoke  Wenger during touchline spat . Arsene Wenger shoves Jose Mourinho in the chest at Stamford Bridge during Chelsea's 2-0 win over Arsenal . Wenger, 64, pushed Mourinho in the chest with the Portuguese manager of Chelsea stumbling backwards . Wenger, speaking to Telefoot on Sunday, said: 'They gave too much importance to this story. In hindsight I think I should not have reacted at all, it's not a way to behave on a football field. 'I always regret any signs of violence and I apologise, but that's part of games where everything is manic - and then we have quite a substantial past. 'Did Mourinho provoke me? That is how I felt. I did not enter Chelsea's technical area.' Interestingly, Mourinho also spoke to the same French TV station about the already infamous incident. Wenger has apologised on French TV for the clash despite initially insisting he had 'nothing to regret' Wenger and Mourinho had to be separated by fourth official Jonathan Moss as their rivalry showed itself . But the Chelsea boss refused to added further fuel to the fire by giving his opinion on the clash. 'Wenger will explain what he wants to explain,' Mourinho said. 'I will not say more. I have no words to explain what everybody else saw in those images.' The apology from Arsenal boss Wenger comes despite his insistence he had done nothing wrong on the touchline at Stamford Bridge.

But much more important is that the players have confidence in the manager and his staff. ‘When I respond I’m arrogant because normally I am always moving in the right direction – I have showed that already.’ Despite winning the last two games, United were holding on against Everton and West Ham and Van Gaal believes the players have still to fully embrace his philosophy. He added: ‘I think they do understand the philosophy but they have to perform that philosophy. We have to see if it is going to a higher level. We need more balance in the team. ‘I said that after the match against Everton, and I am looking for balance in the team not only spectacular attacking football, but also when you lose the ball that you have a shape as a team and that you can defend more easily, and kill the game better. ‘That’s also part of the philosophy and also because I am always choosing creative attacking football players. So we are looking for the balance and we shall see if the time I have had was long enough.’ Van Gaal confirmed that there no fresh injuries from the international break but is not sure if any of his current casualties – Phil Jones, Chris Smalling, Ander Herrera, Michael Carrick and Jonny Evans – would be fit to face West Brom on Monday.

"Jose Mourinho has revealed Roy Hodgson is the only national boss to call him this season as his anger at Spain’s treatment of Diego Costa lingers. Costa missed Saturday’s 2-1 win at Crystal Palace and will definitely be absent for tonight’s Champions League clash against Maribor after sustaining a hamstring injury on international duty last week. The striker’s injury has infuriated Mourinho, who believes the issue could have been avoided with better communication.

The Portuguese watches on as his players warm up at the Blues' training ground in Cobham, Surrey . Andre Schurrle (left) will not be fit to face Maribor despite training on Monday, according to Mourinho . However, the Blues boss claims Spain manager Vicente del Bosque hasn’t once tried to communicate with him about any of Chelsea’s Spanish contingent. In fact, Mourinho (right) says England manager Hodgson is the only national team boss who has been on the phone to him this season. ‘In this moment, since the beginning of the season, I think from all national teams, I’ve had one phone call — from Roy. That’s the only one,’ said Mourinho. ‘There are no rules, no laws to protect us — just the mentality of the national coaches and teams. It’s up to them to take good care of the players or to think in a selfish way. It’s up to them, not to us. ‘I’m not the kind of guy to tell players not to go on international duty or to pretend they have problems. I stimulate them to go and like them to go.

But we can’t resolve that. I can’t ring up and ask to speak to a manager or doctor. That’s out of our hands. ‘I had, in my career, a few in permanent contact with me, asking everything about the player. I’ve had some with very open communication, but others, year after year, not one single text or phone call.’ When asked whether Del Bosque has contacted him this season, Mourinho confirmed: ‘No, never. ‘At Real Madrid (Croatia manager Igor) Stimac used to call me three times a week about Luka Modric. ‘If one day I become national coach I will do it my way. With so many years on this side of the situation as a club manager, I hope I will be good for the clubs and take care of them and the players. ‘At this moment, I’m on this side of it and have to accept the way it is. It hurts. I’m not happy when we give a player in good condition and they come back in bad condition.’ Mourinho said yesterday he has ‘no idea’ when Costa will be fit enough to return to the first-team fold. It is thought he has a slim chance to be fit for the crunch visit to Manchester United on Sunday — but his absence tonight means either Didier Drogba or Loic Remy will lead the line.

Mourinho also revealed he could hand Petr Cech a start in place of Thibaut Courtois, but insisted he is not underestimating the Slovenian minnows, even with Sunday’s trip to Old Trafford on the horizon. ‘I don’t have Manchester United in my mind, I have Maribor on my mind,’ he added. ‘We have to think about this game, our motivation is high and this is a dangerous team. ‘Maribor have played eight matches (in the Champions League) and have zero defeats. ‘They’ve not lost to Celtic, Sporting or Schalke.

"Jose Mourinho launched an attack on Arsene Wenger by claiming he would have been given a stadium ban if he had shoved the Arsenal manager. Despite Wenger’s apology for his actions during Arsenal’s 2-0 defeat at Chelsea on October 5, Mourinho insists the FA give the Frenchman special treatment. Wenger avoided disciplinary action after the high-profile incident at Stamford Bridge because it was dealt with at the time by referee Martin Atkinson. Arsene Wenger shoves Jose Mourinho in the chest at Stamford Bridge during Chelsea's 2-0 win over Arsenal . Mourinho said: ‘I’m not surprised, I’m not surprised. (Me) charged? Charged? If it was me it would have been a stadium ban.’ Mourinho then revealed that he follows his own protocol before matches by shaking hands with opposition managers and insists it is not necessary at the final whistle. He said: ‘The moment I consider fundamental is to shake hands before the match, and before the match in my house, it’s my responsibility. ‘So I always go to the opponents’ dugout, or in the tunnel before the game . . . after the game, it depends on you, on the others.’ Wenger has apologised on French TV for the clash despite initially insisting he had 'nothing to regret' Wenger and Mourinho had to be separated by fourth official Jonathan Moss as their rivalry showed itself . Mourinho also responded to Aston Villa assistant Roy Keane who claimed a Sunday League boss would have knocked him out if he had attempted to shake hands with the opposition before the end of the game. Mourinho said: ‘I don’t know if he really feels it, or if he wants to sell books and needs my help for that . . . but, to be fair, I know my nature, I know my intentions.’ He added sarcastically: ‘I appreciate the comments. I think they are both two great examples of polite and very well-educated people, and because I’m a humble guy who tries to learn every day and with every experience, I appreciate the comments.’ Roy Keane ignored the Blues boss and Paul Lambert refused to shake Mourinho's hand before full-time . Mourinho has also found support from Sunderland manager Gus Poyet who accused Keane of betraying dressing-room secrets. ‘You can’t say one day that “What happens in the dressing room stays in the dressing room”, then write a book. I don’t like it,’ said Poyet.

"Confession: Saleh al-Arouri told Islamic Scholars in Turkey that Hamas fighters snatched the teenagers . A veteran Hamas fighter, who founded the militant group's combat wing, has admitted that they abducted the three Israeli teenagers whose kidnaps triggered the current conflict in Gaza. Saleh al-Arouri, a long-standing member of Hamas, said 'heroic' fighters grabbed the teenagers, two of whom were 16 and one 19. They were later found dead, which helped galvanise Israel's bombing raids and ground operations in the Gaza strip. Hamas had previously refused to comment on Israel's accusations that it was behind the abductions in Hebron, on the West Bank. Speaking at a convention of Islamic scholars in Istanbul, Turkey, where he lives in exile, al-Arouri said: 'There was much speculation about this operation, some said it was a conspiracy'. 'The popular will was exercised throughout our occupied land, and culminated in the heroic operation by the Qassam Brigades [the armed wing of Hamas] in imprisoning the three settlers in Hebron.' 'This was an operation from your brothers in Qassam undertaken to aid their brothers on hunger strike in (Israeli) prisons,' he added. However, no other Hamas figures have backed up the statement, which some experts have said sounds far-fetched. Scroll down for video . Kidnapped and killed: Naftali Frenkel (who was also an American citizen), left, and Gilad Shaar, right, were just 16 when they were kidnapped from the West Bank . Victim: 19-year-old Eyal Yifrach was the third victim. Their bodies were recently found with bullet wounds . The revelation came on a day when Hamas' morale had taken a blow following the funerals of three senior military commanders. The bodies of Mohammed Abu Shamaleh, Mohammed Barhoum and Raed al-Attar were carried aloft through the crowd on stretchers wrapped in green Hamas flags. A Hamas spokesman said Israel 'will not succeed in breaking the will of our people or weaken the resistance', adding that their enemies 'will pay the price.' The men were killed in a pre-dawn strike, which levelled a four-story house in the town of Rafah. Six people were killed, including the three senior Hamas commanders. Israel said the trio had played a key role in expanding Hamas's military capabilities in recent years, including digging attack tunnels leading to Israel, training fighters and smuggling weapons to Gaza. The latest wave of violence in Gaze ensued in the wake of the kidnappings of seminary students Eyal Yifrach, 19, and Gilad Shaer and Naftali Fraenkel, both 16, in June. They were abducted while hitchiking in the Israeli-occupied West Bank on June 12 and killed. Israel promptly accused Hamas, which is based in Gaza but has a presence in the West Bank, of masterminding the attack and began a crackdown on the group in which over a thousand Palestinians were arrested. Tensions already ran deep in the West Bank after weeks of a mass hunger strike by Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal, who is in exile in Qatar, denied knowledge of the abduction but praised its perpetrators. Thronging the streets: Palestinians flock to the funerals in Rafah, Gaza, of three commanders who were killed today . Strikes: Israeli bombs levelled a building while the men, Raed Al-Attar, Mohammed Abu-Shammalla and Mohammed Barhoum, were inside . Smoke rising: The aftermath is seen above from another Israeli strike today in Gaza . Nearly three weeks after the kidnappings, 16-year-old Mohammed Abu Khudair, a Palestinian living in East Jerusalem, was abducted, beaten and burned to death by, prosecutors said, a group of Jewish extremists. Protests broke out in Abu Khudair's neighbourhood and Hamas responded by firing rockets at Israel from Gaza. That escalated into a full-scale war with Israel in which more than 2,000 Palestinians, most of them civilians, have been killed, as well as 64 Israeli soldiers and three civilians in Israel. Two Palestinian suspects Israel has named as the kidnappers of the three seminary students remain at large. Israel said a third suspect arrested by its security forces admitted under interrogation to organizing the kidnapping with funds from Hamas in Gaza.","Saleh al-Arouri, senior figure living in exile in Turkey, made claims yesterday .

"Devastating storms that have dumped as much as 40 inches of snow on parts of the United States and caused widespread flooding in the UK are combining over the Atlantic, weather experts have revealed. Incredible satellite imagery from NASA's Worldview shows the monster storms swirling 'arm-in-arm' across the ocean. The storms in the US have left 21 people dead and caused thousands of flights to be cancelled, bringing the east coast to a standstill. Meanwhile, in Britain, heavy rain and winds up to 80 mph devastated parts of the south, . aggravating areas already flooded after the wettest January since . records began in 1776. Scroll down for video . Holding hands: A storm that dumped heavy snow and ice across the east coast of the United States this week is the very same weather system that battered southern parts of the UK on Friday, meteorologists have revealed in incredible satellite imagery . Floods have drenched the low-lying Somerset Levels in the south west and the Thames Valley west of London, where hundreds of properties have been swamped after the River Thames burst its banks. The situation is also set to get worse as torrential downpours forecast for this weekend could see rivers reaching dangerously high levels. The Thames Barrier, a structure made of 10 steel gates each weighing 3,300 tonnes that shields central London from tidal flooding, prevented widespread damage in the capital after the downpour. This winter's rains saw the Thames record some of its highest levels for 60 years.

Royals to the rescue: On Friday, Prince William and Prince Harry helped flood-hit Brions protect their homes, unloading sandbags alongside soldiers in the village of Datchet in Berkshire, England . On Wednesday, the UK Met Office, the country's weather service, issued a report that linked this winter's extreme weather to global warming. The Atlantic storm system brought another bout of gale-force winds to Britain on Friday, with large waves battering coast lines and up to 1.6 inches of rain causing flood levels to rise. As winds gusted at up to 80 mph, landslips and fallen trees caused havoc on the rail network, and some arriving flights were diverted from London's Heathrow to other airports amid fierce bouts of wind. Motorists were also advised not to travel on the roads this weekend as families tried to escape the south during the half-term school break. Peter Willison of the Environment Agency said Friday's rainfall would send waters on the Thames and other rivers even higher, flooding hundreds more properties. He said it would be 'many days,' and possibly weeks, before flooded rivers receded. Love is in the (freezing) air: Gene Luckabaugh, of Hanover, Pennsylvania, shovels his walk on Valentine's Day .

"With probably the most expensive fuel in the UK and not even showing the price on their board outside, the Texaco petrol station is likely to serve only wealthy customers. The garage in Chelsea's swanky Sloane Avenue is currently selling its Super Plus Unleaded fuel at an extortionate 174.9p per litre. Even those wanting to fill up on traditionally cheaper diesel will find they have to pay 173.9 p per litre. Fuel-ish prices: The Texaco garage under Chelsea Cloisters in Sloane Avenue where the cost per litre has risen to 174.9p . High end: The petrol station looks out of place in its premium location close to pricey boutiques and prime property . Its premium unleaded fuel is only marginally cheaper at 169.9 pence per litre. The petrol station has no rivals in the leafy street extending from the boutiques of Sloane Square to a flagship Chanel store on Brompton Road. So it may come as no surprise to well dressed passers-by that the fact Chelsea houses some of the UK's pricier fuel pumps appears to come with the territory. Multi-millionaire property owner, Christopher Moran who has been a generous donor to the Conservative Party defended the petrol station's prices when it was charging 1.59.9p a litre for standard unleaded fuel earlier this year. 'They do pay an enormous amount of rent,' he said in January, 'If you’re stuck on Sloane Avenue — the highest-valued real estate in London - you’ve got to deal with the real world. 'I have no personal say in pricing, but I will defend their right to charge it because of the cost of the premises.’ Expensive: The prices at the Texaco petrol station appear to be the highest in the UK . The petrol station looks slightly out of place on the street designer boutiques and stores such as The Conran Shop, Kenzo, Joseph and Paul Smith. But it will no doubt have a steady stream of customers who drive the Bentleys, Mercedes and BMWs that stretch along pavements nearby. As petrol prices rise in the wake of pressure on oil production, the government plans to increase fuel duty by 3p a litre in January - meaning an extra £1.50 to fill an average car. Chancellor George Osborne is under pressure to scrap that as part of his autumn statement on the economy later this month. Petrol prices have tripled in the past two decades, but ministers say prices would be even higher had they not scrapped automatic fuel-tax increases imposed by Labour. Mr Osborne scrapped the annual fuel tax escalator - a mechanism under which duty rose by 1p above inflation every year - and cut fuel duty by 1p in March's Budget. However, he has only postponed the planned inflation-linked part of the duty rise from April 2011 to January 2012, and from April 2012 to August 2012.","Petrol station in London's swanky Chelsea sells Super Plus Unleaded fuel at 174.9p per litre .

"Hoax: Dean Richard Kelly called police saying a woman with a shotgun was outside his flat . A dwarf has admitted making a drunken hoax 999 call that brought three armed response teams rushing to his home. Dean Richard Kelly, 37, a silver medallist at the World Dwarf Games, phoned police at around 3am on January 11 and reported a woman with a shotgun and a knife outside his flat in Barrow, Cumbria. He was yesterday given a 16-week prison sentence, suspended for 12 months, after pleading guilty to wasting police time. Three armed response teams, a police dog handler and seven police officers were sent to Kelly's home on Harrison Street, along with a sergeant and inspector, Furness Magistrates’ Court heard. At around 4am, Inspector Carl Patrick sent the teams back to base after realising the call was a hoax - taking police away from Barrow's busy town centre just as a number of nightclubs were closing. The North West Ambulance Service also attended, with the street sealed off throughout the incident. Prosecutor Peter Kelly said: 'This was considered a serious waste of police resources with potential to compromise police ability to deal with incidents.. He wasted 20 hours and 50 minutes of police officers’ time and two hours of staff time.' The solicitor told the court how the incident had cost police £540 on top of operational costs. Kelly initially denied making the call until police played him a recording of the phone call. The court heard he had been drinking but was not 'overly' drunk. Admitted: Dean Richard Kelly was given a 16-week prison sentence, suspended for 12 months, at Furness Magistrates' Court yesterday (left).

The Games are an Olympics-style sporting competition organised every four years . Mr Trystan Roberts, defending, said: 'It's clear this type of behaviour is out of character for this defendant... He can’t really explain why he did this.' 'He says it’s disgusting and he’s ashamed of it - he’s grateful that the police were not taken away from a serious incident,' Mr Roberts added. Kelly was given a 16-week suspended jail term, ordered to carry out 150 hours unpaid work, told to pay £540 compensation to Cumbria police, £85 court costs and an £80 victim surcharge. A spokesperson for Cumbria Police said after the hearing: 'Cumbria Police deal with a vast amount of calls for service each day.' 'Anyone making malicious or hoax calls can put others at risk by detracting away from those who are in genuine need of the emergency services. We will aim to take action against those who make hoax calls and waste the time of the emergency services,' they added. Kelly refused to comment. In August last year Kelly won four silver medals, including the 100 metre sprint, at the World Dwarf Games in Michigan, USA.

"It might be without a creative director, but iconic British brand Mulberry does at least have Cara Delevingne on its side. The 21-year-old model, who is currently the face of the label, unveiled her first attempt at fashion design with a bag created exclusively for the brand. Appearing centre stage on the catwalk in a simple white dress and flanked by a pair of red-haired male models, Ms Delevingne was cool and composed as she showed off the fruits of her first foray into design. And while she might be famous for her quirky sense of style, it seems Cara Delevingne is no slouch when it comes to creating must-have bags. Although Mulberry's new bag is available in a limited edition lion design inspired by the model's tattoo, there were plenty of options for the sartorially shy on offer. Bag lady: Cara stands centre stage with the camouflage haircalf version of Mulberry's brand new Cara Delevingne bag, which was designed by the model herself . Strutting her stuff: As ever Ms Delevigne appeared at home on the catwalk - even when, as on this occasion, her own designs are being revealed for the first time . The reveal: Cara appears on the catwalk to unveil her new bag which comes in three different sizes and three different materials . Stylish: The camouflage option is made from haircalf (calf skin) while the other two are made from natural leather or quilted nappa leather . Top of the class was the beautiful . quilted nappa leather option, available in a range of colours but served . up for the show in vibrant grass green. The natural leather looked . slightly dull, particularly in the small size, but has the potential to . look fabulous in a bigger size and more interesting colour. The . final option was camouflage print in 'haircalf' - Mulberry speak for . calfskin. This last is bound to go whizzing off shelves; an easy way to . jazz up your look and a convenient size to boot. So . what did the model herself have to say? 'My Granny will like this bag,' she revealed. 'She’s 102 years old.' Bizarrely, she went on: 'My . five-year-old cousin will probably like this bag. He’s a boy.' If . he really does, and great-granny too, then Cara really will have earned . the right to add 'fashion designer' to her varied - and . ever-lengthening - CV. But while the model's foray into fashion design proved a hit, stylish eyes were also turning towards this afternoon's schedule, which includes Matthew Williamson, Topshop Unique and Vivienne Westwood. SamCam's new wardrobe? First lady friendly frocks and a succession of crimson co-ords formed the backbone of the Preen show . Colourful: Tomato red was the hue of choice for the brains behind Preen by Thornton Bregazzi . Tailoring: Preen's outsize silhouette was once more in evidence . Bold: Print added interest to the collection's limited palette . Elsewhere, day three got off to a . flying start with Preen, firmly established as one of London's hottest . names by designers Justine Thornton and Thea Bregazzi. On . this showing, their reign as one of the capital's most exciting . designer duos looks set to continue, courtesy of a show that combined . gorgeous geometric prints with their trademark outsize tailoring. The . palette was kept minimal, focused on black, charcoal, cream and jolts . of bright tomato red, but that certainly didn't mean boring. Highlights . included a stunning shirt-waist dress, enlivened with print to hem and . sleeve, and a tomato red tunic and trouser combo. More . co-ords followed - a trend that doesn't seem to be going anywhere soon - . and some first lady friendly frocks, including a stunning cream number . crafted from delicated lace and brightened with a panel of tomato red. Expect to see SamCam in it soon. Just as diverting was the front row, which included . Yasmin Le Bon and socialite Olivia Palermo. Living . dolls: Sophia Webster's dollhouse presentation saw models perch at . primary coloured dressing tables and even relaxing in a bubble filled . bath . Pretty: Powder pink and delicate pastels once again ruled the roost at Sophia Webster, a designer famous for her grasp of colour . 90s . cool: Webster showed that she's still a 1990s girl at heart, . referencing the decade's penchant for houndstooth, extreme girliness and . the odd bit of grunge . Following Preen was  Pringle of . Scotland who showed a confident collection awash with muted nudes and . beiges - all the better to show off some of the best tailoring of . fashion week so far. Also . offering a clever approach to cut and finish was Margaret Howell whose . thoroughly British basics included a beautifully soft blue Fair Isle . knit and a sequence of librarian chic cream silk blouses. Riffing . on the librarian theme, Howell also showed a baggy olive trouser suit - . perfect for stacking stray books in - and a succession of heavy velvet . and whalecord skirts and dresses. Bookish it certainly was but boring . not at all. Another to take . a cerebral approach was shoe designer Sophia Webster, whose . presentation involved models clad in 90s sweatshirt dresses and . houndstooth perched at lilac dressing tables and flopped, long limbs . modestly crossed, in bubble filled baths. While . the set-up was eye-catching, it was upstaged by the shoes which for . A/W14, included chunky fur-filled mules and delicate strappy sandals . jazzed up with a fluffy heel. Once . again, powder pink proved a winner, with Webster splashing it onto . shoes in the shape of pretty pastel pink hearts and fluffy pom poms to . maximum girly effect. Tour . de force: Richard Nicoll proved yet again that he's a dab hand at . tailoring with a very clever grasp of colour and silhouette . Stunning: Richard Nicoll's self-assured show emphasised, once more, why the designer is well worth a place at the top table of British fashion . Up next was another fashionistas favourite, Richard Nicoll, who, unsurprisingly for a man who earned his fashion stripes consulting for Marc Jacobs at Louis Vuitton, is no slouch when it comes to knowing what women want to wear. The man who gave the world the one size fits all geometric print t-shirt dress was on winning form once more today, with a collection that combined relaxed tailoring with loose, wearable shifts and striking knife-pleat dresses. Nicoll opted for a surprisingly summery palette, with powder blue and cheerful cerise domninant although there was the odd flash of mustard and cobalt. In what has to be a first for a winter show, black and stark white were entirely absent, suggesting next autumn could be far more colourful than most expected. Colour notwithstanding, highlights included a stunning knife pleat dress in petrol blue and white, and a gorgeously wearable cerise jumper teamed with a knife pleat skirt. On this evidence, summer's love of all things pleated will be with us well after the snow arrives. Summery: Richard Nicoll showed tailoring in summery powder blue . Blues: Nicoll's penchant for blue also encompassed navy, cobalt and petrol . Cheerful: A simple knitted cerise dress was lifted with three simple rosettes .","The model, 21, unveiled the Cara Delevigne bag at Mulberry's A/W14 show .

"Police knocked on the door of the home where three missing girls were held captive for a decade - but left when no one answered, it was revealed today. Officers visited the home on Seymour Avenue in Cleveland, Ohio in 2004 as part of a child services' investigation. Police had been alerted to the man living at the home, Ariel Castro, now a suspect in the abduction, after he inadvertently left a boy at a bus depot while working as a school bus driver. No criminal charges were brought and no follow-up inquiries made. Amanda Berry, 26, and Gina DeJesus, 23, and Michelle Knight, 32, escaped the home on Monday night, where it is believed they had been chained for ten years. Questions will now be asked as to how police and federal investigators failed to find the girls who remained undetected at the home just three miles from the block where they all went missing. A neighbor of accused kidnapper Ariel Castro has revealed that she saw a naked woman in his backyard two years ago and reported the incident to police . This map shows the block, Lorain Avenue, in Cleveland where the three girls went missing, years apart. They were found Monday on Seymour Avenue, approximately three miles from where they were abducted . Ariel Castro has lived in the house since . 1992. His two brothers - Pedro, 54, and O'Neal, 50, - do not live at the . home but were arrested in connection with the three abductions. Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson also told a news conference on Tuesday that police responded to the west side home in 2000 following a disturbance in the street. Authorities said that public records show no complaints or building violations at the Seymour Avenue home. There is also no record of any emergency service or fire department calls. On Tuesday, Cleveland Police said: 'Every single lead was followed up on no matter how small. We dug up yards, canvassed neighborhoods. [The] real hero is Amanda Berry.' Until now the search for the missing women had been fruitless, a series of false leads and bitter disappointment for the desperate families. Last July, an empty lot on the west side of Cleveland was excavated for the body of Amanda Berry by forensic crews working on a tip from a convict. The small lot on West 30th Street and Wade Avenue -  which is two blocks from the Seymour Avenue home where the women were held - turned up nothing. At the time, a local resident named Pedro Castro told Fox 8 that the search was 'a waste of money'. Michelle Knight, who was 20 years old . when she went missing in August 2002, was last seen at a cousin's house . near West 106th Street and Lorain Avenue. Three . years later, in April 2003, Amanda Berry, disappeared after leaving her . job at a Burger King - at West 110th Street and Lorain. It was the day . before her 17th birthday. And a year later, Gina DeJesus, then 14 years old, was last seen leaving her middle school at West 105th Street and Lorain. All three were found safe on Monday night after Berry bolted from a home on Seymour Avenue, about three miles from where they were last seen. She told police that she and the other girls were being held prisoner by Ariel Castro, 52, who has been arrested along with his two brothers on suspicion of kidnapping. The exact circumstances of the abductions is currently unclear, and it is not known whether or not the kidnapper deliberately targeted the block where all three victims were taken. Combing: Cleveland police and FBI agents search a yard. There were apparently signs that dirt had recently been moved in the backyard of the house . The story of Amanda and Gina's . disappearance has been well known in the area for the past decade, as . their relatives have continually held vigils and kept the story alive in . the press. Michelle's case was less high profile - she was 18 at the time of her disappearance on Aug. 23, 2002 and was last seen at a cousin's house near West 106th Street and Lorain Avenue. Michelle was not officially registered as missing on the Ohio Police Missing Persons website. Her grandmother, Deborah Knight, told . the Plain Dealer that some family members had concluded, based in part . on suggestions by police and social workers at the time, that she had . run away after he son was removed from her custody. But mother Barbara Knight told Cleveland.com that long after police stopped searching, she kept the hunt up for her daughter handing out fliers on Cleveland's West Side. She told them that several years ago she believes she saw her daughter walking with an older man at a shopping plaza on West 117th Street. She said that she shouted out her daughter's name but the woman, who was being pulled along by her companion, did not turn around. Ms Knight, told the newspaper she never believed her daughter . would have vanished without a trace on her own and that she kept . searching long after police gave up looking for her. 'I'm praying that if it is her, she . will come back with me, so I can help her recover from what she has been . through,' the mother was quoted as saying. 'So much has happened in . these 10 years. She has a younger sister she still has not met.' Search: Amanda Berry disappeared on April 21, 2003, a day before her 17th birthday . Three years later Amanda Berry disappeared on April 21, 2003, a day before her 17th birthday. Amanda vanished shortly after she called her sister to say that she was . getting a ride home from her job at Burger King. Amanda's mother, Louwana Miller, who had been hospitalized for months with pancreatitis and other ailments, died in March 2006 aged 44. She . had spent the previous three years looking for her daughter, whose . disappearance took a toll as her health steadily deteriorated, family . and friends said. Councilwoman Dona Brady said she had spent many hours with Miller, who never gave up hope that her daughter was alive. 'She literally died of a broken heart,' Ms Brady said. In April 2004, Miller turned to a psychic on Montel Williams’ nationally syndicated television show. The psychic, Sylvia Browne said She’s not alive, honey.' 'Your daughter’s not the kind who wouldn’t call.' Browne said she envisioned Amanda’s jacket in a Dumpster with 'DNA on it.' Miller went back to the West Side home where she had been keeping Amanda’s things in careful order and cleaned up. This is the Burger King at West 110th Street and Lorain Avenue where Amanda Berry was last seen in April 2003. The other two girls were also last seen on the same block . She gave away her daughter’s computer and took down her pictures. 'I’m not even buying my baby a Christmas present this year,' she told local newspaper Cleveland. In 2009, Wisconsin investigators believed there were striking similarities between Amanda and the body found by deer hunters. But  test results comparing Amanda's DNA and that of the body came back negative. In January, a prison inmate was sentenced to four and a half years after admitting he provided a false burial tip in the disappearance of Berry. A judge in Cleveland sentenced Robert Wolford on his guilty plea to obstruction of justice, making a false report and making a false alarm. Last summer, Wolford tipped authorities to look for Berry's remains in a Cleveland lot. He was taken to the location, which was dug up with backhoes. Two men arrested for questioning in the disappearance of  in 2004 were released from the city jail in 2006 after officers didn't find her body during a search of the men's house. One of the men was transferred to the Cuyahoga County Jail on unrelated charges, while the other was allowed to go free, police said. Missing: Gina DeJesus, aged 14, went missing on April 2, 2004, on her way home from Wilbur Wright Middle School on Parkhurst Drive . A year after Georgina DeJesus, then 14, disappeared on her way home from Wilbur Wright Middle School  on Parkhurst Drive. Known as Gina, the seventh-grader in special education classes, was last seen near a payphone in Cleveland in mid-afternoon on 2 April 2004 with a classmate. The pair had called the friend's mother asking for a sleepover at the Gina's house, but when the girl's mother said no the pair parted ways. 'I gave her the $1.25 to catch the bus because it was cold outside,' said her mother, Nancy Ruiz. But she has 'the tendency to walk home and use the money for' after-school snacks, she explained. A bloodhound tracked her scent a . block from the corner of West 105th Street and Lorain Avenue, where she . was last seen, to West 104th Street, then the trail went cold. Gina’s cousin Sylvia Colon told local press in 2004 that her father, Felix, was 'beyond desperate' to bring her home. Ruiz’s yard and house in the 3700 block of West 71st Street become a shrine for Gina. She lit candles on her porch on a nightly basis and prayed for the safe return of her daughter. Distraught: Felix DeJesus, holding a banner showing his daughter's photograph, standing by a memorial in his living room in Cleveland (file photo) Victim: Last year, Gina's mother Nancy Ruiz raised concerns that her daughter might have been the victim of human trafficking . Two men arrested for questioning in the disappearance of DeJesus in 2004 were released from the city jail in 2006 after officers didn't find her body during a search of the men's house. One of the men was transferred to the Cuyahoga County Jail on unrelated charges, while the other was allowed to go free, police said.

"Wind farms could be the key to stopping hurricanes devastating the US and costing billions of dollars of damage, researchers have claimed. A team at Stanford simulated three of the biggest hurricanes ever to hit the US - Sandy, Isaac and Katrina - and found turbines at at sea could dramatically reduce the amount of damage they caused. They found turbines reduced peak wind speeds by up to 92 mph, and storm surges by up to 79%. Scroll down for video . The ultimate hurrican defence? A team at Stanford simulated three of the biggest hurricanes ever to hit the US - Sandy, Isaac and Katrina - and found turbines at at sea could dramatically reduce the amount of damage they caused . Jacobson's model revealed that an array of 78,000 wind turbines off the coast of New Orleans would have significantly weakened the hurricane well before it made landfall. The turbines slow the outer winds, which decreases wave height and reduces movement of air toward the center of the hurricane. This increases the central pressure, which in turn slows the winds of the entire hurricane and dissipates it faster. In the computer model, by the time Hurricane Katrina reached land, its simulated wind speeds had decreased by 36-44 meters per second (between 80 and 98 mph) and the storm surge had decreased by up to 79 percent. Computer simulations by Professor Mark Jacobson showed the offshore farms could prevent billions of dollars in damages. 'We found that when wind turbines are present, they slow down the outer rotation winds of a hurricane,' Jacobson said. 'This feeds back to decrease wave height, which reduces movement of air toward the center of the hurricane, increasing the central pressure, which in turn slows the winds of the entire hurricane and dissipates it faster.' The study, conducted by Jacobson, and Cristina Archer and Willett Kempton of the University of Delaware, was published online in Nature Climate Change. Researchers simulated three hurricanes: Sandy and Isaac, which struck New York and New Orleans, respectively, in 2012; and Katrina, which devastated New Orleans in 2005. In the case of Katrina, Jacobson's model revealed that an array of 78,000 wind turbines off the coast of New Orleans would have significantly weakened the hurricane well before it made landfall. An aerial view of the damage around Atlantic City, New Jersey in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy: Researchers believe that offshore wind farms could help hurricanes dissipate and reduce damage . In the computer model, by the time Hurricane Katrina reached land, its simulated wind speeds had decreased by 36-44 meters per second (between 80 and 98 mph) and the storm surge had decreased by up to 79 percent. For Hurricane Sandy, the model projected a wind speed reduction by 35-39 meters per second (between 78 and 87 mph) and as much as 34 percent decrease in storm surge. Jacobson the reduction of hurricane damage cost and electricity production of the scheme could persuade stats to install it. Hurricane Sandy, for instance, caused roughly $82 billion in damage across three states. 'The turbines will also reduce damage if a hurricane comes through,' Jacobson said. 'These factors, each on their own, reduce the cost to society of offshore turbines and should be sufficient to motivate their development.'","Team simulated Sandy and Isaac, which struck New York and New Orleans in 2012 and Katrina, which devastated New Orleans in 2005 .

"Contestants will shimmy down the catwalk trying to impress the judges in day wear, swimwear and evening wear, but that's where the parallels end between the traditional Miss World and its alternative alter ego taking place at London's Globe Theatre next month. The Alternative Miss World, which first took place in 1972, celebrates all things fabulous, flamboyant and unique. Perfectly toned bodies, spray tans and silky blow-dries are out. Think drag, glitz, glitter and avant-garde design. The pageant is expected to attract 1,800 suitably-attired spectators to watch the glittering spectacle which will see 17 contestants vie for the 'crown jewels' trophy. Left: Founder and organiser Andrew Logan with Ruby Wax taken at the last Alternative Miss World in 2009 ; Right: Hair and makeup, the alternative way . The last Alternative Miss World took place in 2009 and Fancy Chance (pictured above) won the title . The show's founder and organiser, sculptor Andrew Logan, explains, 'It's all about . transformation - but it goes way beyond drag. You can transform into anything. It's about letting your imagination really . fly.' He describes the event as 'the opposite' of the real Miss World. 'Creativity, equality and the unique are celebrated. We have no restriction on age, sex or gender and no rehearsals,' he says. 'I've always called it the surreal art event. When everyone comes together it's like a moving sculpture of people.' The judging criteria may differ wildly from the real Miss World contest, but Logan says they are based on another famous beauty contest - Crufts Dog Show. At the last Alternative Miss World in 2009 (pictured above left and right), 2,500 people gathered at The Roundhouse to celebrate individuality . Julian Clary (left) with founder and organiser Andrew Logan at the 2004 event. The pageant, which has day wear, swimwear and evening wear categories, first ran in 1972 . 'It's all about poise, personality and originality,' says Logan. 'I went to Crufts in 1971 – and that's where I got the idea.' This year, is the thirteenth pageant since its inception. The last one took place at The Roundhouse in London's Chalk Farm in 2009 and attracted 2,500 revelers. Celebrated sculpture Grayson Perry is co-hosting this years pagaent. 'I’ve known Grayson since he was a young man. Now he’s the golden boy of the art world - and quite rightly so. It's great to celebrate with him.'

Not your average beauty queens: they may not have perfect hair and model figures but these party-goers (left and right) at the 2004 event look the part for the Alternative Miss World . In the past the event has drawn celebrity fans including Ruby Wax, Julian Clary, and Zandra Rhodes, milliner Stephen Jones and Rula Lenska. The theme this year is 'neon numbers'. 'Numbers is what we’re ruled by at the moment,' says Logan. 'And neon is the total antithesis to what you expect at The Globe, which will make it all the more interesting.' 'I like to think Shakespeare would have been very keen on this event though. He might even have entered himself.'

"A law student has caused a stir online after publishing a novel design for a drone-proof city. Shura City, designed as a class project by Asher Kohn, 25, is an attempt to use architecture to counter surveillance and targeted attacks by the remote-controlled aircraft. The provocative design, which is like a sci-fi riff on traditional Middle-Eastern architecture, uses a range of tricks to confuse the aerial death machines and keep the city's inhabitants concealed. The drone-proof city: Law student Asher Kohn has created a stir online with this, his design for a city that would foil military attempts to operate surveillance and targeted strikes with remote-controlled aircraft . Drone strikes and surveillance are increasingly part of everyday life in the 21st century. Barely a week goes by without news of a fresh attack by the machines somewhere in the world. According to the UK's Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a minimum of 2,629 people have so far been killed by drones in Pakistan alone, with many more in other countries like Yemen and Somalia. And it is not only people living in predominantly Muslim countries who find themselves targeted, as police and spying agencies are increasingly using the aircraft as a covert means of surveillance at home in the West. It was recently revealed that the U.S. military drones with surveillance capabilities so powerful they are able to track the movements of an entire medium-sized city all at once. Mr Kohn, who is currently based in the Netherlands, came up with the idea for his drone-proof city for a class on 'Extreme Architecture' he was taking at the Sam Fox School of Design in St Louis, Missouri. He told MailOnline: 'I was assigned ""military architecture"" and realized that for every huge military advance that made it easier to blow up urban areas, there was usually a passive response invented within a generation. 'So I was wondering what the response would be for drones if drones are the next great advance like artillery and airplanes were.' However, despite the widespread, and unexpected, publicity the design has been given, he said he was nervous about calling it a 'full' design' 'It's really just an idea,' he said. 'These aren't blueprints, it's not like this little 10-page thing is enough for some guy to decide to build his own. 'It's really just a conversation starter. I didn't take even take the class for a grade.' Attack of the drones: Tribesmen gather at the site of a drone strike in Tappi, a village 12 miles east of Miranshah, near the Afghan-Pakistan border, which killed six people . In the paper, Mr Kohn writes: 'Architecture against drones is not just a science-fiction scenario but a contemporary imperative. 'Such creations are not needed for the John Connors but for the Abdurahman al-Awlakis. 'The successful check against the . machines is not a daydream but an inevitability, and the quicker more . creative solutions are proposed, the more likely such answers can be . disseminated widely and kept from the patent-wielding hands of some . offshore-utopian type.' Shura . City, provocatively named for the groups of elders who take decisions . in the Islamic communities which are the principal targets of drone . strikes, is a product of Mr Kohn's fascination for 'drones' existence in . a post-legal world'. Ringed by minarets and built from concrete, which drone sensors cannot penetrate, its layout would be specifically designed to confuse from the outside - foiling the airborne watchers' ability to dish out targeted death from above. 'The goal is not defense-through-hardening, but defense-through-confusion,' writes Mr Kohn. 'By turning the entire community into a closed circuit, drones targeting individuals will not be able to select and detect the individuals they desire once they enter the city.' Windows of the city would be made from multi-coloured blocks of glass, to further foil drones' attempts to get a fix on to their targets. 'The changing colours make it more difficult for electronic cameras to peer in and make out one person from the next without hints of skin tone or clothing colour,' says Mr Kohn. A U.S. Air Force MQ-9 Reaper drone: According to the UK's Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a minimum of 2,629 people have so far been killed by drones in Pakistan alone, with more elsewhere . A sinister airborne surveillance camera gives the U.S. military the ability to track movements in an entire city like a real-time Google Street View. The ARGUS-IS array can be mounted on unmanned drones to capture an area of 15 sq/miles in an incredible 1,800MP - that's 225 times more sensitive than an iPhone camera. From 17,500ft the remarkable surveillance system can capture objects as small as 6in on the ground and allows commanders to track movements across an entire battlefield in real time. 'It is important for the public to know that some of these capabilities exist,' said Yiannis Antoniades, the BAE engineer who designed the system, in a recent PBS broadcast. The aerospace and weapons company developed the ARGUS-IS array as part of a $18.5million project funded by the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa). In Greek mythology, Argus Panoptes, guardian of the heifer-nymph Io and son of Arestor, was a primordial giant whose epithet, 'Panoptes', 'all-seeing', led to his being described with multiple, often one hundred, eyes. Like the Titan of myth, the Pentagon's ARGUS-IS (a backronym standing for Autonomous Real-time Ground Ubiquitous Surveillance-Imaging System) works by stringing together an array of 368 digital camera imaging chips. An airborne processor combines the video from these chips to create a single ultra-high definition mosaic video image which updates at up to 15 frames a second. Dr Steven Wein, director of optical sensor systems at BAE Systems, said: 'The ARGUS-IS system overcomes the fundamental limitations of current airborne surveillance systems. 'Very high-resolution imaging systems required for vehicle and dismount tracking typically have a ""soda-straw"" view that is too small for persistent coverage. 'Existing wide-area systems have either inadequate resolution or require multiple passes or revisits to get updates.' A further addition to the fenestration . could be the addition of high-tech equivalents to traditional Arabic . mashrabiya - the delicate carved lattice-work which are often seen on . windows in Middle East cities. In . Shura City the mashrabiya would be movable and able to form new . patterns - even QR codes which would make any interloping drones . spontaneously self-destruct. 'Today, . the codes are often shoehorned unattractively into advertisements made . for human eyes. This is ugly, stupid, and ineffective,' writes Mr Kohn. 'Tomorrow, . a drone trying to peer through a window could get guillotined by a . mashrabiya contorting itself into a self-destruct code. Now that’s more . like it' At the head of Shura City would be a . roof, as a physical barrier to prevent drones coming too close, but . criss-crossed with lines to break up the profile of the buildings below. Making the city a closed . environment would also allow it to be climate controlled, in such a way . that heat-seeking cameras would be ineffective at picking out the . inhabitants outside. Mr Kohn first submitted the concept for Shura City in spring last year, but his design has been widely reported on the web in recent days. He has predictably come in for some criticism, moral but also practical, like Forbes contributor Michael Peck's claim that Mr Kohn is trying to fight a 'lost battle'. 'It is much easier and quicker to improve drone aircraft, software and sensors than it is to change a building or a city to fool them,' writes Mr Peck. 'The 1990s Global Hawk was the size of a small passenger jet. Now drones are the size of insects. 'If we can’t keep mosquitoes out of our homes, a mosquito-sized drone won’t be any easier to swat.' He adds: 'However, the truth is that while police drones overhead are bad, living in a jail is worse. It is not a good trade if the price of privacy is quality of life. 'Twisting streets to confuse drones? Wait until the pizza delivery guy or your grandmother can’t find your house.' But Mr Kohn makes no claim to have created the be all and end all of drone-proof cities, but says he merely wants to provoke discussion of the implications drones have for how future societies might be structured. 'What this project proposes is a new way to think about space,' Mr Kohn writes. 'Drone warfare proposes that every inch of land is (and all of its inhabitants are) part of the battle space.' He concludes: 'Shura City is about using architecture to create aspace for humanity in an increasingly inhuman sphere.' Mr Kohn added to MailOnline: 'A few people have told me that hiding from drones is illegal, which I find hilarious, because, wait, we're expecting people to just be totally on-board with fiery death coming down from the sky without a moment's notice? 'I'm just using the vocabulary of architecture to point out the shortcomings of drone warfare. My whole point was that law has nothing to do with it.'

"Hackers brought down several public NATO websites in what appears to be the latest escalation in cyberspace over growing tensions over Crimea. The Western military alliance's spokeswoman, Oana Lungescu, said on Twitter that the cyber attacks, which began on Saturday evening, continued on Sunday, although most services were eventually restored. 'It doesn't impede our ability to command and control our forces. At no time was there any risk to our classified networks,' another NATO official said. NATO's main public website (www.nato.int), which carried a statement by Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen saying that Sunday's referendum on Crimea's status would violate international law and lack legitimacy, worked intermittently. Several Nato websites have been hit by cyber attacks, but they have had no impact on the military alliance¿s operations, a spokeswoman said, despite being shut down for several hours at the weekend . A group of 'Ukrainian patriots' calling itself ¿cyber berkut¿  - after the old regime¿s feared riot squad - says it targeted the NATO sites for ¿interference¿ in their country¿s affairs . The hacktivist group, Cyber Berkut, said that it took down NATO's primary website and the website of its cyber defense center in a post on their own website (pictured) The so-called 'distributed denial of service' (DDoS) attack, in which hackers bombard websites with requests causing them to slow down or crash, also hit the site of a NATO-affiliated cyber security center in Estonia. NATO's unclassified e-mail network was also affected. A group calling itself 'cyber berkut' said the attack had been carried out by patriotic Ukrainians angry over what they saw as NATO interference in their country. The claim, made at www.cyber-berkut.org, could not be independently verified. 'Berkut' is a reference to the feared and since disbanded riot squads used by the government of ousted pro-Russian Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich. Cyber warfare expert Jeffrey Carr, in a blog on the attacks, described cyber berkut as staunch supporters of Yanukovich and a 'pro-Russia hacktivist group working against Ukrainian independence'. Lungescu noted the statement by 'a group of hacktivists' but said that, due to the complexities involved in attributing the attacks, NATO would not speculate about who was responsible or their motives. Cyberattacks from both sides have escalated over the prior weeks, as Crimea ¿ a Ukrainian peninsula bordering Russia that's about the size of New Jersey ¿ approaches a vote tomorrow over secession, which is expected to end in the region joining Russia . John Bumgarner, chief technology officer at the U.S. Cyber Consequences Unit, a non-profit research institute, said initial evidence strongly suggested that these cyber attacks were launched by pro-Russian sympathisers. 'One could equate these cyber attacks against NATO as kicking sand into one's face,' he said. Cyber attacks on NATO's computer systems are common, but a NATO official, speaking on condition of anonymity on Sunday, said this was a serious online assault. Ian West, director of NATO's cyber defense nerve center at Mons in southern Belgium, said last year that the alliance's network intrusion detection systems handled around 147 million 'suspicious events' every day and around 2,500 confirmed serious attacks on its computers in the previous year. Occupied by Russian forces for two weeks, the largely Russian-speaking Crimea holds a referendum on seceding from Ukraine to join Russia on Sunday. NATO states have opposed the move, calling it unconstitutional and effectively an annexation of Ukraine's sovereign territory. Tensions between Moscow and the West have been rising steadily since Russia intervened following the ouster of Yanukovich. Ukrainian and Russian websites have both been targets for cyber attacks in recent weeks but this appeared the first major attack on a Western website since the crisis began. Suspected Russian hackers used DDoS attacks to cripple websites and services in Estonia in 2007 during a dispute over a war memorial, and against Georgia during its brief 2008 war with Russia. Moscow denied orchestrating such attacks, saying they were simply carried out by independent patriots. Groups calling themselves cyber berkut have attacked several Ukrainian websites in recent weeks, computer security experts say. Cyber berkut - which some experts believe may be affiliated with Russian intelligence - published its statement in Russian rather than Ukrainian.","Ukrainian hacktivist group claiming responsibility for bringing down several public NATO sites at the weekend .

"Aid agency Medecins Sans Frontiere has been carrying out hundreds of life-saving operations at a secret hospital in war-torn Syria. An international team of doctors converted a villa in the Middle East country into a field hospital to treat people caught up in the bloody conflict. Those working at the state-of-the-art medical centre say they have decided to speak out and appeal for help because the health situation in Syria has become 'desperate'. Victims: Wounded Syrian children after an air strike destroyed at least ten houses in the town of Azaz on the outskirts of Aleppo, Syria . Some of those receiving treatment included victims who have traveled for up to two days for help, said members of the small group of physicians yesterday. It took doctors a week to transform the home in a rebel-held area in northern Syria into a field hospital, equipped with an emergency room, an operating theatre, a sterilisation room and a resuscitation area. The centre, which has been mainly treating war casualties from the country's second city of Aleppo, opened in late June after months of planning and secret attempts to smuggle in equipment. 'We could see and hear the shelling almost on a daily basis,' said Brian Moller, an Australian anesthetic nurse on the team of seven foreigners and about 50 Syrians. 'Enough is enough. Both [the Syrian regime and the opposition] are increasingly relying on violence to achieve their aims. 'The health situation in Syria is desperate. We need to open up humanitarian access routes, especially to Aleppo. It is time to speak up and say we need a political solution.' Free Syrian Army rebels bring an injured civilian to a clinic after a heavy bombardment in the center of Aleppo last week . Moller said they made sure the Syrian government knew about them without letting authorities know where the field hospital would operate. 'They did not appreciate or like our presence,' he added. Katherine Holte, a Danish surgeon who spent four weeks at the field hospital, said conditions were growing increasingly dire in Syria, and nearly all her patients were victims of the fighting - about 60 percent suffering from explosions and 40 percent from gunshot wounds. 'They live in fear every day,' she said. Adding that many patients used back roads to skirt checkpoints and other military operations, taking as long as two days to travel 15 miles. Although small field hospitals are appearing around Syria, Ms Holte said few have the resources of the one established by the aid group, also known as Doctors without Borders. The hospital's exact location is being kept secret for fear it may be targeted by regime forces and from the outside it looks just like a civilian home, said MSF. An Syrian injured fighter in Aleppo, in Syria on Friday. Rebel footholds in the city have been the target of weeks of Syrian shelling and air attacks . Holte said other, cruder hospitals around the county learned about the villa and soon started sending their own patients. The French military sent its own team of doctors to the Syria-Jordan border earlier this month to set up a mobile hospital. France, Syria's onetime colonial ruler, has been in the forefront of diplomatic efforts to end the civil war in Syria. On Tuesday, French President Francois Hollande was meeting in Paris with members of the opposition Syrian National Council, including its leader, Abdelbaset Sieda, a Swedish-based activist for Syria's minority Kurdish community. A total of 150 operations have so far been declared in the centre which has been declared illegal by the Syrian regime and wounds inflicted on victims are said to have become much worse since the July  rebel bomb attack which killed President Bashar-al-Assad's inner circle. MSF also said it was seeing more injuries caused by tank-shelling, aerial bombardment and heavy artillery than at another other time during the 17-month conflict. U.S. officials have said conflict had turned the area into one of the world's biggest humanitarian crises, with 2.5million people inside Syria now in neeed of aid and injured victims having to spend days crossing into neighbouring countries for help.","International team of doctors converted villa in Middle East country .

"The un-PC police commissioner: Paris Brown, 17, posted foul-mouthed rants boasting about her sex life, drug taking and drinking binges . Britain's first youth police commissioner was facing urgent calls to quit last night after she tweeted a torrent of foul-mouthed rants boasting about her sex life, drug taking and drinking binges. Paris Brown, 17, also posted violent, racist and anti-gay comments. She was appointed last week to the £15,000 taxpayer-funded post to represent young people’s views on policing. But politicians last night insisted that her position was untenable after her disgusting outbursts were revealed by The Mail On Sunday. In one she appears to condone . drug-taking, revealing: ‘I really wanna make a batch of hash brownies.’ Elsewhere she complains: ‘Worst part about being single is coming from a . party/night out horny as f*** and having to sleep alone.’ Another says: ‘Been drinking since . half 1 and riding baby walkers down the hall at work oh my god i have . the best job ever haha!!’ And in one vile message, she says: ‘i want to . f****** cut everyone around me.’ Elsewhere she rails against gays as . ‘fags’, immigrants as ‘illegals’ and travellers as ‘pikeys’, while . admitting she has ‘a thing for older men’ – an apparent reference to a . teacher at her former school. Just . two months ago, Miss Brown wrote: ‘F****** hell why are the people from . Direct Pizza so difficult to talk too!! IT IS CALLED ENGLISH. LEARN . IT.’ And she attacked the . male actors in the reality show Made In Chelsea, writing: ‘Everyone on . Made in Chelsea looks like a f****** fag.’ In the months leading up to her . appointment she repeatedly demonstrated her apparent disdain for the law . and propensity to anti-social behaviour. Just three weeks ago she appeared to . support an apparent assault, saying: ‘I don’t condone violence but im so . pleased that my brother thumped the fat little ****.’ Describing . herself in one tweet, she said: ‘im either really fun, friendly and . inclusive when im drunk or im an anti social, racist, sexist, . embarrassing a****** often its the latter.’ And in another she boasted: . ‘am getting so drunk this saturday, so so painfully oh so unattractively . drunk.’ The comments come from a personal Twitter account, Paris . @vilulabelle, where she had posted or circulated more than 4,000 . messages and images, many of them offensive. Outbursts: Kent Police and local Crime Commissioner Ann Barnes (right) has defended the teenager and asked for some perspective due to Miss Brown's age. The pair are pictured after Miss Brown was appointed to the role . Yet . only days ago Miss Brown pledged in a series of television interviews . to change perceptions of young people who, she insisted, were mostly . ‘lovely’. Miss Brown’s . comments represent a further blow to police credibility, which was . undermined last week by The Mail on Sunday’s disclosures about WPC Kelly . Jones, who sued a burglary victim after tripping over a kerb at his . petrol station. Miss Brown was hired to cover Kent and . was interviewed by the county’s assistant chief constable. It was hoped . the appointment would be a blueprint for the rest of the country. But . that plan lay in tatters last night. Miss . Brown reports to Ann Barnes, 67, who was elected to the £85,000 role of . Kent Police and Crime Commissioner last year. PCCs were elected in 41 . police forces in England and Wales in November and each one has control . over the budget and policing priorities in their area. Keith . Vaz, chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Select committee, said: ‘I am . deeply shocked by these disclosures. This individual must be removed . from their post immediately. Public money should never be given to . anyone who refers to violence, sex, drunkenness and other anti-social . behaviour in this offensive manner. The Government must now reconsider . its point blank refusal to publish a national list of all the . appointments made by Crime Commissioners – as requested by my committee. ‘The public has a right to . know who they are, how they were appointed and their full backgrounds. That is the best way to stop irresponsible and unsuitable people being . taken on.’ However Mrs Barnes defended her young adviser, and insisted that she should remain in her post. ‘You cannot condone any offensive tweets and I certainly would not accept anything like that now that Paris has been appointed but I wanted somebody for this job who was a typical teenager,’ she said. She added: ‘There is no way I would think of removing her from her post and I am sure Paris will learn from this mistake and be able to move forward to making a success of the role like I know she will.’ Miss Brown, who is not old enough to vote or legally purchase alcohol, was chosen from 164 hopefuls who applied for the position that was advertised in February this year. She was encouraged to apply for the role by bosses at Swale Borough Council in Kent, where she earns £2.65 an hour in a full-time apprenticeship role as an office junior. The final part of the selection process involved an interview with Mrs Barnes and Lee Russell, the Chief Inspector of Kent Police. Role: Miss Brown was hired to cover Kent and was interviewed by the county's assistant chief constable . After being appointed, Miss Brown who lives at her family’s £250,000 home in Sheerness, on the Isle of Sheppey, with her mother Debra, 48, father Dennis, 51 and three brothers, Ross, 23, Miles, 20 and ten-year-old Mason, said the job would help her be the ‘messenger’ for young people. Miss Brown claimed that she chose to put on hold plans to do A-levels to take up the year-long post. However . in another posting she told of her intention to work as a holiday rep . on the Greek island of Kavos or the Spanish island of Ibiza, both . renowned for their hedonistic, party atmosphere. Creating . a youth police and crime commissioner role was a manifesto pledge of . Mrs Barnes, who said: ‘Young people don’t have much of a voice in . policing in Kent and I’m determined to change that. ‘Paris . is going to be the young face of policing in the county and I’m quite . sure she is going to do a brilliant job at helping the police to connect . with young people. ‘She’s very exceptional. She has a real commitment to working with young people. She’s confident and she’s got bags of energy.’ But Miss Brown appeared to be aware that her personal tweets could be damaging to her professional reputation. Her comments and Twitter account were deleted yesterday, after the Mail on Sunday contacted her. And last week she started an official @YouthPCC Twitter account and a new personal account, @parisbrownn, explaining to friends that the accounts would be used ‘for work’. Last night Miss Brown told The Mail on Sunday: ‘When I tweet I do often exaggerate and, to clarify, I am not racist or sexist but I’m not going to lie – I have been guilty of showing off in the past. ‘When I sit indoors with my mum I will have a small glass of wine every now and again but I’m not an alcoholic. ‘You are allowed to drink at home. At a family meal or maybe at Christmas I will have a glass of wine or maybe a Malibu and lemonade but I don’t have a drinking problem, I don’t condone drinking to excess. ‘I have never taken drugs and I don’t condone anyone taking drugs. The tweet I wrote about making hash brownies is actually a line from a Scooby Doo film and not something I would ever do.’ Mrs Barnes added: ‘Paris may have in the past been stupid and made some spur of the moment comments which I certainly do not condone but she has matured quickly into a very confident and mature young woman. ‘I am sure she will be ashamed of these comments but I would bet you that any parent who accessed a Twitter or Facebook account would be surprised and perhaps shocked at some of the stuff that’s on it because that’s what kids do. ‘They like to impress their mates and I imagine Paris has been found guilty of boasting in many of these messages.’","Paris Brown, 17, boasted about her sex life, drug taking and drinking .

"I’ve lived and worked on Tyneside and I totally understand the frustrations of Newcastle United fans. Years ago, by day, I was a poorly paid young football reporter trying to make my way in the industry; by night I was the friendly barman making up my income, chatting about the Toon until the early hours on the Tuxedo Royale, a nightclub on a boat moored under the Tyne Bridge, with a revolving dancefloor and lots of scantily clad barmaids. I’m beginning to wonder why I ever left! Newcastle fans were vocal in their calls for manager Alan Pardew to be sacked at Southampton on Saturday . Alan Pardew clung on to his job despite Saturday's 4-0 thrashing but the pressure is growing by the week . Newcastle owner Mike Ashley seemed in high spirits despite the heavy defeat . Micky Quinn was the top dog back then – he used to come in regularly, I even served Gazza and his mates once. If I knew then what I know now I’d have refused for his own good. But Newcastle United was at the centre of everything for most of the punters in there – win, lose or draw that’s what they wanted to talk about. The lack of trophies was always a massive problem for Newcastle United fans, but even though that hurt they could still take pride in the goals of Quinn, the trickery of Ginola, the local pride of Shearer, the passion of Keegan. Right now there is nothing for the St James’ Park faithful to enjoy, and whilst they angrily vent their frustration at manager Alan Pardew, they also want answers from the owner Mike Ashley, answers he never ever looks likely to give. Newcastle miss players who show pride in the club and the city, like Alan Shearer . The days of brilliant players like David Ginola wearing the black and white seem an age ago . Pardew has shown some glimpses of brilliance in his managerial career – witness the incredible run he took Newcastle on last season – seven wins from nine games in November and December until Yohan Cabaye was sold and not replaced. But right now Pardew’s stock is lower than a snake’s belly. Managers come and go but an owner usually sticks around for much longer. So it’s always puzzled me why Newcastle United fans have never seized the initiative and bought the club. More than 50,000 go to watch home games regularly, there must be thousands more who don’t go, including many who love Newcastle United but have left the city and even the UK for work or family reasons. The commitment and passion of Newcastle's fans has never been in doubt - perhaps they should buy the club . There are surely enough fans, some of whom will be incredibly wealthy, who can put together a fans’ trust to launch a credible, effective takeover of this great club, and then they can run it they way the fans want it to be run. Why hasn’t this happened already? Geordie legends would be queuing up to be part of this, as figureheads or to even put their own money in. It’s a massive city, with one club in it. The fanbase is huge and more importantly they deserve so much more than they’re getting right now from Newcastle United, and far more than they have received from the club for many years. I’m at St James’ Park on Saturday for what many think could be Pardew’s final game in charge. It’s a place I love going back to, and a stadium where I spent many working hours cutting my teeth in this industry. It’s special. So here’s my question for the Toon Army – if you dislike Mike Ashley and Alan Pardew so much, why don’t you buy the club from him and fire the manager yourselves?","Newcastle United fans called for manager Alan Pardew to be sacked during Saturday's 4-0 loss at Southampton .

Delaney’s deal expires at the end of the season, while Ward’s contract has two more years left to run. An extension for Delaney is understood to be at a more advanced stage than the move to sign Ward to fresh terms.

"The Blue Angels got their wings back - after being grounded for much of the last year due to forced spending cuts, the U.S. Navy's premier flying squad are returning to the sky. The U.S. Navy Flight Demonstrative Squadron - the official name of the elite fleet of blue and gold airplanes - will start its 2014 airshow season with a performance at the Naval Air Facility in El Centro, California, on March 15. The last time the Blue Angels took to the sky for an airshow was April of last year. They're back: After being grounded for nearly a year due to budget cuts, the Navy's elite flying squad returns to the skies . The squad is scheduled to do 68 performances between Saturday and November 8, in 35 locations across the U.S., according to CNN. In April of 2013, the U.S. Air Force grounded about a third of its active-duty force of combat planes and the U.S. Navy cancelled the rest of the Blue Angels' aerobatic team's season because of automatic federal budget cuts. To compensate for the cuts, the branch focused its budget and resources on units supporting major missions, like the war in Afghanistan, while other units stand down on a rotating basis. Air show season: The Blue Angels will perform 68 shows at 35 venues across the country between Saturday and November . Spectacular sight: The breathtaking acrobatics performed by the pilots draws crowds around the country . The Air Force's budget for flying hours was reduced by $591 million for the rest of the 2013 fiscal year. As news trickled out that the Navy had cancelled the remainder of Blue Angels' season, business owners and residents of the coastal enclave where the team is based expressed resignation and disappointment. The cancellation, part of the massive . budget sequester spending reductions that forced the military to . slash $41 billion from its budget, saved an estimated $28 million, NBC San Diego reported. 'I just think it's sad that there are political games being played. I doubt the Blue Angels are even half of 1 percent of the entire Navy budget,' said Lloyd Proctor, co-owner of Blue Angel Hot Tubs in Pensacola. Proctor and his wife named their business after the team 10 years ago. Rock stars: The Blue Angels are considered the 'Rolling Stones' of the airshow industry . 'They have national name recognition and they are loved by people everywhere,' Proctor said Tuesday. Most held out hope that the grounding was temporary and that the season could somehow be salvaged. Thousands of fans flock to Pensacola Beach each July to watch the team fly over the white sand and turquoise surf. It is always the biggest tourism revenue weekend of the year, said W.A. Buck Lee, president of the Santa Rosa Island Authority. Lee said he had hoped that the six fighter jets would be allowed to continue practicing as a team and the Pensacola Beach show could be replaced by a routine practice over the beach. Instead, the Navy said that the six elite pilots would maintain only minimum flight hours to remain qualified in their F/A 18 Hornets and that squadron practices would end for the remainder of the season. The Blue Angels were formed in June 1946 to show off American naval aviation to the public and boost morale within the military.Since then, they have performed in front of 427 million amazed spectators with their acrobatics.They have also been used as a recruitment tool for the Navy.The fighter pilots selected to serve a two-year tour with the team are among the world's best and are often graduates of the Navy's famed Top Gun air tactics school. 'The economic impact of the show for us is more than $2 million,' Lee said. 'People are going to start cancelling their hotel rooms and will hurt businesses here.' At the time, a spokesman for the Navy said team members would be allowed to fly minimal hours to maintain flight proficiency in the F/A 18 fighter jets, but the six-jet squadron would discontinue group practices for the remainder of the season. The Air Force says, on average, aircrews 'lose currency' to fly combat commissions within 90 to 120 days of not flying and that it generally takes 60 to 90 days to conduct the training needed to return aircrews to mission-ready status. Returning grounded units to mission ready status will require additional funds beyond Air Combat Command's normal budget, according to Air Force Officials. 'Even a six-month stand down of units will have significant long-term, multi-year impacts on our operational readiness,' Air Combat Command spokesman Maj. Brandon Lingle said in an email to The Associated Press. For affected units, the Air Force opted to shift its focus to ground training. That includes the use of flight simulators and academic training to maintain basic skills and aircraft knowledge, Lingle said at the time. Grounded: Budget cuts have forced the U.S. Navy to cancel the rest of the Blue Angels performances for the rest of 2013 . A spokesman for the Navy said team members would be allowed to fly minimal hours to maintain flight proficiency in the F/A 18 fighter jets, but the six-jet squadron would discontinue group practices for the remainder of the season. The Air Force puts on a similar air show with the Thunderbirds, elite pilots demonstrating in F-16s. They were also forced to cancel their 20 shows scheduled for the rest of the year. 'The Blue Angels are the Rolling Stones of the Air Show World and losing them, whether it’s a few days, a few months, or a few years, it is a crushing blow, not only to the industry, but for thousands of fans,' John Cudahy, president of the International Council of Air Shows, told FoxNews.com. 'The Blue Angels and the Thunderbirds are huge draws for our industry and when they don’t participate in an air show it not only hurts attendance -- it makes it less than it was,' he added. Organizers for Seafair, a yearly summer festival in Seattle, Wash., shared the sentiment with a release on their website the day it was learned the Blue Angels would be canceling their season. 'Today we were officially informed by the U.S. Navy Blue Angels that their season has been cancelled, including the Seafair performance, due to federal budget cuts resulting from sequestration,' reads the statement. 'The Blue Angels have flown at Seafair for over 40 years and are an important part of our history. The team will be deeply missed by Seattleites…' The Blue Angels have wowed more than 427 million spectators since their inception in 1946 .","The Blue Angels have been grounded since April due to budget cuts .

"The Playstation 4 could cost as little as £270 when it launches later this year, according to a report in a Japanese newspaper. The Asahi Shimbun reports that Sony's new gaming console will cost 40,000 Yen - which translates to about £270. However, UK gamers will have to factor in VAT, which adds a whopping 20 per cent to the price, taking the possible UK figure to around £325. Tantalizing: Sony posted a video teasing gamers to spark excitement about the forthcoming PS4 console which will be in stores later in the year . Even at that price, the PS4 will be a bargain. The PS3 cost 60,000 Yen when it launched in Japan 2006. The new console is expected to be announced at a press conference in New York on February 20. If the price is as low as the rumours suggest, it could steal a march on Microsoft's next-generation Xbox console, which doesn't yet have a launch date. Microsoft's console, which could be . named the Xbox 720,  could be announced at the annual E3 gaming . conference, held in Los Angeles in June. By royal appointment: Prince Harry was pictured using a PS3 during a moment of relaxation at Camp Bastion in Afghanistan in November . And observers expect it to be on the shelves in time for Christmas, which could mean a battle for supremacy between Microsoft and Sony as their next-generation consoles go head-to-head in the vital holiday season market. The next-generation Xbox console could require gamers to be permanently connected to the internet - ruling out the use of second-hand games, according to a report in Edge magazine. The next Xbox will 'be absolutely committed to online functionality', says the magazine, quoting sources with first-hand experience of Microsoft's latest console. Gamers will be required to activate games in the same way as most other software from Microsoft and other publishers is already activated online. An activation system would check that you are the registered user of the game each time you start it up - you wouldn't even be able to lend it to a friend. However, the move to an always-on connection raises the possibility of games embracing other pricing models such as those seen on portable devices including smartphones and tablets. With an always-on connection, games could be very cheap, or even free, but make their profits through in-game purchases of better equipment. However, rumours suggested yesterday that gamers in the UK could have to wait until next year until Sony's PS4 finally lands on British soil. A developer told Edge magazine that Sony is planning to concentrate its marketing efforts on its home market in Japan and the US. The move would be to ensure that Sony can push sufficiently high numbers of the console out to stores for Christmas and not lose sales because of insufficient units being shipped. All eyes are on the specs for Sony's new console. Rumours yesterday surfaced that it would be heavily focused on the cloud, which would put the Japanese' firm's purchase last year of a leading cloud-based gaming company into perspective. Sony paid $380 million for Gaikai in June last year. At the time Sony's chief executive, Andrew House, said: 'By combining Gaikai's resources including its technological strength and engineering talent with SCE's [Sony Computer Entertainment] extensive game platform knowledge and experience, SCE will provide users with unparalleled cloud entertainment experiences. 'SCE will deliver a world-class cloud-streaming service that allows users to instantly enjoy a broad array of content ranging from immersive core games with rich graphics to casual content anytime, anywhere on a variety of internet-connected devices.' At the time it was reported that Gaikai had been hoping for a buyer to spend around $500 million. The new console is also expected to have a touchpad controller, as well as an eight-core x64 AMD processor (codenamed 'Bulldozer), 8GB of RAM, 2.2GB of video RAM, four USB ports that use the new high-speed USB 3.0 standard, a Blu-ray drive, a hard drive of 160GB, an Ethernet port, and both HDMI and optical outputs. Specs for the next-generation Xbox are rumoured to be comparable, with insiders suggesting that it will also pack 8GB of RAM, HDMI connectors and USB 3.0. The launches are important for both Sony and Microsoft, as gamers have moved away from consoles since the Xbox 360 and the PS3 debuted. More and more people have shifted to the tablet and the smartphone as a gaming platform. Analysts expect that tablets and other . mobile devices will match the power and graphics of today's games . consoles within a few years. Many . are already able to run the kinds of 3D games that were once the . exclusive preserve of those dedicated machines and high-spec gaming PCs. The slimline PS3 cost 60,000 Yen when it launched in Japan 2006. The next generation PS4 is expected to retail for around 40,000 Yen (about $430)","Reports say that price would be lower than PS3 was at launch .

"For an hour or so, Diego Costa had the look of a striker who might have been nursing a hamstring problem; one which was preying on his mind, eating away at confidence and preventing him from turning his dial to full power. Then he crashed a header past Villa keeper Brad Guzan to score Chelsea’s second goal — his eighth in seven games this season — created the third for Willian and, with Chelsea’s opponents beaten, left the field to another standing ovation. Jose Mourinho’s team continue to forge ahead at the top of the Premier League. They have won from the front before and are shaping up as if in the mood to do it again. Yet the lingering concerns over Costa’s fitness will stop anyone getting carried away in west London. Chelsea striker burst into life with a crashing header on the hour and was the catalyst for another in his side's comfortable victory at Stamford Bridge . CHELSEA 4-2-3-1: Courtois 6.5; Ivanovic 7, Cahill 5.5, Terry 6, Azpilicueta 6; Fabregas 7, Matic 7; Willian 7.5, Oscar 7 (Mikel 77), Hazard 6 (Schurrle 68, 6); Costa 7 (Remy 81). Subs not used: Cech, Luis, Zouma, Drogba, Remy. Bookings: Cahill, Fabregas. Manager: Jose Mourinho 7. ASTON VILLA 4-5-1: Guzan 6.5; Hutton 6, Senderos 6, Baker 6, Cissokho 6; Richardson 6 (Bent 69, 5), Cleverley 6.5, Westwood 6.5, Delph 7, Weimann 5 (N’Zogbia 69, 5); Agbolahor 7. Subs not used: Given, Clark, Bacuna, Sanchez, Grealish. Bookings: Cleverley, Senderos . Manager: Paul Lambert 6 . Without him, they lose their cold spearhead. While he is fit and tormenting centre-halves they seem well-armed to charge clear. Loic Remy replaced Costa for the last 10 minutes, as Mourinho turned his thoughts to Tuesday’s game against Sporting Lisbon in the Champions League and wondered whether he can risk him from the start in Portugal. Mourinho’s team remain unbeaten this season. They have dropped only two points from six games. After Sporting, they play Arsenal at home and Mourinho knows his striker must be handled with extreme care. ‘He is doing almost nothing [between games],’ said Mourinho. ‘He’s just resting and recovering from the tight muscle he has every time he accumulates fatigue. I hope he goes home after this game and sleeps until tomorrow morning. ‘He cannot be at the top of his game but even so, scoring a goal is good for his confidence.’ ‘If he doesn’t go to the national team, and stays here for 15 days of treatment, he has the perfect chance to be top for Chelsea and top for national team. We can’t do anything. I can’t speak to the Spain manager.’ If there was any cause for complaint yesterday, it might have been that the manager would have liked the points to be secure sooner, especially as it had started so well, when Oscar fired in a seventh-minute opener, a goal owing everything to the persistence of Willian. Branislav Ivanovic slid a pass to the latter, who forced Guzan into a save but the rebound spilled kindly to Willian, who spotted Oscar unmarked. From seven yards, Oscar swept in his first Premier League goal of the season. Willian went close soon after but the visitors responded.

Aston Villa striker Gabby Agbonlahor shoots to no avail against Chelsea . Aly Cissokho almost turned a shot on target when Chelsea failed to clear a corner and Gary Cahill was booked for tripping Gabriel Agbonlahor after being turned and left on the turf by the Villa striker. It was the home team, however, who dominated both in terms of possession and unconverted chances, defied as they were by wasteful finishing, solid defending and good goalkeeping. For almost an hour Costa had lacked some of his usual menace. Twice, either side of half time, he was found in front of goal and twice Guzan saved without fuss. The sequence ended in the 59th minute. Cesar Azpilicueta delivered the cross from the left, clipped towards the near post for Costa, who climbed above Nathan Baker and this time beat Guzan for power. This was the goal to sink Villa. They had set up to play on the counter-attack and there was plenty to admire about their spirit and energy. Fabian Delph impressed in an English midfield trio with Ashley Westwood and Tom Cleverley and almost equalised in the second half with a shot from distance. ‘If you told me we would take three points from Liverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea, I would probably have taken it,’ said Villa manager Paul Lambert. ‘It’s tough and we’re up against Manchester City next. ’ Despite the quality of the opposition, it is back-to-back 3-0 defeats for Villa and their 1-0 win at Anfield on September 13 loses its gloss with each subsequent game Liverpool fail to win. Villa are still without captain Ron Vlaar and striker Christian Benteke and a positive start to the campaign has taken a turn for the worse since the club was struck by a virus last week. And yesterday Lambert was left to reflect on chances not taken when they trailed 1-0; Baker headed a good one over from a free-kick and Lambert said: ‘When you get a chance you have to score. It’s hard to come here at the best of times. Chelsea will be close to winning the title and the Champions League.’ By the end, however, Villa had managed only one shot on target and Thibaut Courtois celebrated his second clean sheet of the season. Chelsea pressed on after the second goal. Cissokho recovered well to clear off his own line from Oscar but Willian then grabbed the goal his performance deserved by scoring from Costa’s rebound. This was enough for Mourinho. With a three-goal lead, off came Costa to be wrapped in cotton wool. Like our MailOnline Sport Facebook page.

"Doctors at a major hospital in Boston have become the first in America to use Google Glass for everyday medical care despite privacy fears about the device. Medics at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centre are using the controversial eyewear to keep their hands free, which they see as the ‘holy grail’ of hospital technology. Doctors are looking up patients’ records on Google Glass and checking things online whilst they walk around rather than wading through big files. Dr Steven Horng, at Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital, poses for a portrait wearing Google Glass by the QR code that he and other doctors will use to read patient records . They have also put codes on the doors to patients’ rooms so that they can instantly access a patient’s medical records. Beth Israel says that it is using the most modern technology to help patients - but privacy campaigners have long said Google Glass is invasive. The hospital has also not outlined how it will seek permission of patients to be filmed by the device’s in-built camera. Google Glass, which costs $1,500 a pair (£980), is currently on limited release to a few thousand people but will be more widely available later this year. Beth Israel says that it is using the most modern technology to help patients - but privacy campaigners have long said Google Glass is invasive . Google Glass is being used at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centre: . - look up patient’s file on the spot without thumbing through a big file . - allow them to stay with a patient for longer . - access patient’s files through QR codes on the patient’s doors . - keeps doctor’s hands free to interact with patientIn the future Google Glass could allow: . - surgeons to watch colleagues operating in real time . - doctors making the rounds remotely whilst a robot with a camera and a monitor showing their image visits them in person . - patients to remotely show their doctors their injuries via the Google Glass camera . It is connected to the Internet via wi-fi and has a tiny screen that lets the user see text and images in front of their eye. Beth Israel has rolled it out in its entire emergency department and and doctors including Steven Horng say it is helping them to do their jobs. He told the Boston Globe: 'We’re doing this to prove that the technology can work and really motivate others to explore this space with us. 'Not only is it hands free, it’s always on, always in front of you and always giving you information. ‘Rather than having to excuse myself, it means I can quickly access that information without having to interrupt the patient, lose eye contact, or even leave the room’. Dr Horng said that in January he thinks that Google Glass may have helped to save a patient’s life. The man had bleeding in the brain and needed drugs to stop the hemorrhage but he was allergic to a certain kind. Dr Horng was able to look up the medical files on his eyewear rather than taking vital seconds out to search through his paper files. Beth Israel is also experimenting with QR (Quick Response) codes on the doors to patient’s rooms which doctors scan with the camera on Google Glass to bring up the records. How Glass works: A German designer created this infographic to show how the eyewear projects an image . Each code is unique to the patient, though it is not clear if anyone can access them if they have a scanner. Beth Israel is not the first hospital to use Google Glass and surgeons at Indiana University Health Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis have used to in an operation to cut out an abdominal tumor. The surgeon was able to call up MRI scans without having to put his instruments down. At the University of California-Irvine Medical Center, senior doctors are also monitoring junior medics as they make their rounds. Outside of the medical profession, Google Glass is being used by Virgin Atlantic flight crew to check in passengers on trans-Atlantic trips. But there has also been controversy and some cafes in America have banned the eyewear out of concerns for privacy. Google Glass users Cecilia Abadie was also given a driving ticket in California for using Google Glass behind the wheel, though the case was later dropped.","Eyewear is being worn by medics at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical .

"A 'brilliant and ethical' professor who lost his job at a major US university over anti-Israel remarks on Twitter says he is 'not sorry'. Steven Salaita claims he was speaking his mind when he tweeted about the military conflict in Gaza weeks before taking up a tenured role at the University of Illinois on the American Indian Studies. However, his comments were deemed unacceptable and the school refused to accept him as an American Indian Studies professor this fall. 'Not sorry': Professor Steven Salaita has refused to apologize for the anti-Israel tweets that cost him his job . Hitting out at the decision, Mr Salaita told a press conference: 'The way that I have always tweeted sort of has to do with the way things are happening in the moment politically and discursively. 'The [university] administration's actions threaten the principles of free speech, academic freedom, and critical thought that should be the foundation of any university.' Dozens of professors have condemned the university's actions against Mr Salaita, with many threatening to boycott classes. In one tweet, Mr Salaita told his followers: 'It's simple: either condemn #Israel's actions or embrace your identity as someone who's okay with the wholesale slaughter of children.' Another read: 'Only #Israel can murder around 300 children in the span of a few weeks and insist that it is the victim.' On the same day he wrote: 'It's quite simple, really: don't support any ideology whose practice results in dead children.' 'Offensive': This is one of the comments that the University of Illinois deemed offensive before sacking Salaita . Freedom of speech: Dozens of professors have come out in support of Salaita's freedom to speak his mind . The Palestinian-American professor claims he regrets the posts that cost him his job but refuses to apologize. And the university insists it will not revoke the decision.

"The Playstation 4 could cost as little as $430 when it launches later this year, according to a report in a Japanese newspaper. The Asahi Shimbun reports that Sony's new gaming console will cost 40,000 Yen (around $430 at today's exchange rates) and that the console will be in stores for Christmas. Gamers will get all the details when Andrew House, president of Sony Computer Entertainment, announces the launch at a press conference in New York on February 20. Tantalizing: Sony posted a video teasing gamers to spark excitement about the forthcoming PS4 console which will be in stores later in the year . Yet early reports are hinting that the PS4 could be a bargain. The PS3 cost 60,000 Yen when it launched in Japan 2006. That would convert to around $507 back then, but $640 at today's Yen level. If the price is as low as the rumors suggest, it could steal a march on Microsoft's next-generation Xbox console, which doesn't yet have a launch date. Microsoft's console, which could be . named the Xbox 720, may be announced at the annual E3 gaming . conference, held in Los Angeles in June. By royal appointment: Prince Harry was pictured using a PS3 during a moment of relaxation at Camp Bastion in Afghanistan in November . And observers expect it to be on the shelves in time for Christmas, which could mean a battle for supremacy between Microsoft and Sony as their next-generation consoles go head-to-head in the vital holiday season market. The next-generation Xbox console could require gamers to be permanently connected to the internet - ruling out the use of second-hand games, according to a report in Edge magazine. The next Xbox will 'be absolutely committed to online functionality', says the magazine, quoting sources with first-hand experience of Microsoft's latest console. Gamers will be required to activate games in the same way as most other software from Microsoft and other publishers is already activated online. An activation system would check that you are the registered user of the game each time you start it up - you wouldn't even be able to lend it to a friend. However, the move to an always-on connection raises the possibility of games embracing other pricing models such as those seen on portable devices including smartphones and tablets. With an always-on connection, games could be very cheap, or even free, but make their profits through in-game purchases of better equipment. All eyes are on the specs for Sony's new console. Rumours yesterday surfaced that it would be heavily focused on the cloud, which would put the Japanese' firm's purchase last year of a leading cloud-based gaming company into perspective. Sony paid $380 million for Gaikai in June last year. At the time Sony's chief executive, Andrew House, said: 'By combining Gaikai's resources including its technological strength and engineering talent with SCE's [Sony Computer Entertainment] extensive game platform knowledge and experience, SCE will provide users with unparalleled cloud entertainment experiences. 'SCE will deliver a world-class cloud-streaming service that allows users to instantly enjoy a broad array of content ranging from immersive core games with rich graphics to casual content anytime, anywhere on a variety of internet-connected devices.' At the time it was reported that Gaikai had been hoping for a buyer to spend around $500 million. The new console is also expected to have a touchpad controller, as well as an eight-core x64 AMD processor (codenamed 'Bulldozer), 8GB of RAM, 2.2GB of video RAM, four USB ports that use the new high-speed USB 3.0 standard, a Blu-ray drive, a hard drive of 160GB, an Ethernet port, and both HDMI and optical outputs. Specs for the next-generation Xbox are rumored to be comparable, with insiders suggesting that it will also pack 8GB of RAM, HDMI connectors and USB 3.0. The launches are important for both Sony and Microsoft, as gamers have moved away from consoles since the Xbox 360 and the PS3 debuted. More and more people have shifted to the tablet and the smartphone as a gaming platform. Analysts expect that tablets and other . mobile devices will match the power and graphics of today's games . consoles within a few years. Many . are already able to run the kinds of 3D games that were once the . exclusive preserve of those dedicated machines and high-spec gaming PCs. The slimline PS3 cost 60,000 Yen when it launched in Japan 2006. The next generation PS4 is expected to retail for around 40,000 Yen (about $430)","Reports say that price would be much lower than PS3 was at launch .

"When Manchester City paid Porto £32million this summer to make Eliaquim Mangala the most expensive defender in the history of British football, it was with a view to keeping goals out. On Saturday, the Frenchman fell some way short of expectations. He scored an own-goal and conceded a penalty as the Barclays Premier League champions surrendered a two-goal lead at the KC Stadium. Manuel Pellegrini’s side recovered to secure their first win in four league games with a decisive goal from Edin Dzeko and Frank Lampard’s fourth in a week, but the result should not paper over the fact that this game proved every bit as challenging for Mangala as his debut against Chelsea last weekend. Frank Lampard is congratulated by Pablo Zabaleta after scoring Manchester City's fourth and final goal at the KC Stadium . Lampard was in the right place at the right time to convert Zabaleta's cross for his fourth goal in his last three matches . Edin Dzeko celebrates his strike to put Manchester City 3-2 ahead against Hull City . Dzeko (on the floor) squeezed the ball past defender Liam Rosenior and goalkeeper Allan McGregor to score City's third . Abel Hernandez sweeps home a penalty to draw Hull level at 2-2 on 32 minutes after Eliaquim Mangala conceded the spot-kick with a high boot . Sergio Aguero, Yaya Toure, Vincent Kompany and Fernandinho trudge back to kick-off after Hull pulled themselves back on to level terms . The home supporters take great pleasure in taunting the City fans as Hernandez celebrates his equalising goal with a glance to the heavens . Eliaquim Mangala looks dejected after conceding the own goal that allowed Hull City back into the match . MINS PLD    KM       MILES . Hull City                             110.4       68.6 . Ahmed Elmohamady   90  11.0         6.8 . Tom Huddlestone       90   10.9        6.8 . Liam Rosenior            90   10.7        6.7 . Manchester City                109.4      68.0 . James Milner           90     12.7        7.9 . Yaya Toure              90     10.9       6.8 . Edin Dzeko              90     10.2       6.3 . He passed that test with flying colours. This one did not go quite so smoothly. There was no one near the Frenchman when Liam Rosenior crossed into the box from the right flank in the 21st minute, having beaten Gael Clichy far too easily. Mangala craned his neck and guided the ball over Willy Caballero into the top corner. There was a sympathetic pat on the back from captain Vincent Kompany but worse was to follow in the 31st minute. Mohamed Diame clipped the ball towards Abel Hernandez inside the box and Mangala looked every inch a lumbering centre-back as he launched into a clumsy challenge, sinking his boot into the Uruguay striker’s midriff. Referee Anthony Taylor pointed to the spot and Hernandez slotted home. Those kind of mistakes could prove far more costly against Roma in the Champions League on Tuesday night, but Pellegrini was quick to defend his player. ‘You cannot analyse a player from one match, not when he played wonderfully in the last game and everybody said he was the best defender in the world,’ said the City boss. ‘He has played in the Champions League, won titles with Porto and is in the French national squad. We cannot analyse because he was unlucky or made a mistake. He’s a very good player and will continue playing in our team. ‘I think the own-goal was very unlucky. To score from where he did is very difficult. It made Mangala a little bit nervous and he gave away the penalty. But he played very well in the second half which wasn’t easy with a yellow card.’ Man City goalkeeper Willy Caballero is left helpless as Mangala diverts the ball past him for an own goal . Edin Dzeko celebrates with strike partner Sergio Aguero after doubling City's lead after 11 minutes . Neither goal was the fault of Caballero, who kept his place in goal following the seven-goal thrashing of Sheffield Wednesday in the Capital One Cup in midweek, but will relinquish it to Joe Hart against Roma. ‘For Willy it was good to play not just one but two games,’ added Pellegrini. ‘Joe Hart had played eight games in 32 days so that’s a lot of games for a goalkeeper.’ For the opening 11 minutes it looked as though City could do without a goalkeeper altogether as they raced into a two-goal lead. Sergio Aguero was the recipient of Pablo Zabaleta’s knockdown in the seventh minute, swivelling to hook the ball past Allan McGregor and into the far corner. There were more serious question marks over Hull’s defending when Dzeko got the second four minutes later. Dzeko is obscured by Michael Dawson and Liam Rosenior as he curls the ball into the top corner from 20 yards for City's second goal . Sergio Aguero celebrates his seventh-minute goal which gave Manchester City the lead at the KC Stadium . The Argentine spun into space inside the Hull box and fired home on the half-volley to put the champions in front early on .

PLAYER RATINGS BY CHRIS WHEELER AT THE KC STADIUM . The Bosnia striker still had plenty to do when David Silva found him on the edge of the box. Two markers stood off him and Dzeko cut inside before sending a magnificent effort curling into the top corner. That was the cue for Mangala to go into meltdown as Hull levelled before half-time with a magnificent fightback. Hull boss Steve Bruce said: ‘It shows the character that we rolled up our sleeves up and got back into it. ‘For a good hour, it could have gone either way. We gave it a right good go, but it just didn’t go for us.’ Eliaquim Mangala blocks a Nikica Jelavic shot with his outstretched leg as Hull threaten the City goal . Curtis Davies attempts to block a cross from Pablo Zabaleta as City pour forward in search of the winning goal . After Yaya Toure had rattled the post with a thunderous 30-yard strike, Dzeko nudged City back in front with a far less impressive effort in the 68th minute. Again Silva was the provider, sliding the ball to his team-mate inside the box. Dzeko’s shot bobbled under Rosenior’s body and agonisingly wide of McGregor’s outstretched fingers on its way inside the far post. Edin Dzeko is surrounded by Hull defenders as he attempts to fire off a shot from just inside the penalty box . Ahmed Elmohamady tries to get the better of Gael Clichy and cross from near the touchline as Hull go on the offensive . Sergio Aguero gets ahead of Mohamed Diame as he tries to instigate another Man City attack . After scoring a dramatic late equaliser against his old club Chelsea and two more in midweek, it was no surprise that Lampard weighed in with another after coming off the bench. He arrived to meet Zabaleta’s pass and stroke the ball home from close range. It will no doubt fuel the debate about how long City can delay Lampard’s move to New York City. ‘I was absolutely sure that Frank could continue being a very important player,’ said Pellegrini. ‘At 36, he can’t play three (full) games in a week but nobody can be surprised at the way Frank Lampard is playing.’ Joe Hart looks miserable sat on the bench after being replaced by Willy Caballero as Frank Lampard signs autographs for the home fans at the KC Stadium .

"Everton defender Phil Jagielka scored an outstanding equaliser in the closing stages of his side's match to cancel out what appeared to be a winning goal by Steven Gerrard. Gerrard's former England team-mate Gareth Barry had a nightmare start to the Merseyside derby by receiving a yellow card inside the first two minutes before handling inside the penalty area and hacking down Mario Balotelli. However Barry managed to compose himself to stay on the pitch for the remainder of the game. Here, Sportsmail's Dominic King gives his verdict on the performance of both sets of players. LIVERPOOL (4-2-3-1) Simon Mignolet – For some reason, Everton didn’t look to take advantage of his shaking confidence. Never looks like he is totally comfortable –5.5 . Javi Manquillo – Nothing headline grabbing from the Spanish right-back but is becoming a dependable figure in Liverpool’s defence – 7 . Martin Skrtel – If he was vulnerable at West Ham, he looked commanding here with another week’s training under his belt – 7.5 . Martin Skrtel showed why he is one of the first names on Brendan Rodgers' teamsheet with a fine display . Dejan Lovren – Been an erratic start to life at Anfield for the Croatia international but this, a few glitches apart, was his best performance to date – 7 . Alberto Moreno – He has made a bright impression since arriving from Sevilla and continued that here, providing energy and stell down the left – 7.5 . Steven Gerrard – Big game, big goal, sound display. Relished the opportunity to silence his critics with a dipping free-kick, never wasted a pass – 8 . Steven Gerrard silenced the doubters by scoring what appeared to be the winning goal in the 65th minute . Jordan Henderson – The top midfielder on the pitch. Seemed to covered every yard, passed the wall and relished driving his team forward – 8.5 . Raheem Sterling – A thorn in the side of Everton’s defenders, buzzed forward whenever the chance allowed, providing a succession of dangerous balls – 8 . Adam Lallana – Growing into the role of a Liverpool player, unlucky not to score against the team he supported as a boy with a thumping header – 7.5 . Lazar Markovic – Looks anything but a £20million forward at the minute. Struggled to make any kind of impression and froze whenever he did get the ball – 5 . Mario Balotelli – Moments of the sublime, moments of the ridiculous. Should really have finished his first Merseyside derby with two goals – 6 . Mario Balotelli came close to scoring his first Premier League goal since joining the red side of Merseyside . SUBS . Coutinho (for Lallana), Lambert (for Balotelli 88mins) UNUSED . Jones (GK), Enrique, Toure, Lambert, Coutinho, Lucas, Suso . MANAGER . Brendan Rodgers – Managers get paid to make the crucial decision and in the 64th minute, Rodgers hollered at Balotelli that he wanted Gerrard to take a free-kick rather than the Italian. The result was Liverpool’s goal – 7.5 . Brendan Rodgers instructed his captain to take three free-kick which led to Liverpool's opening goal . EVERTON (4-3-3) Tim Howard – Undid all the good work of keeping Liverpool at bay in the first 45 minutes when he failed to deal with Gerrard’s free-kick – 5.5 . Tony Hibbert – Rare start for the veteran right-back and found it hard work trying to contain Sterling at times during the second half – 5.5 . Phil Jagielka – Everton’s saviour with a goal that will almost certainly rank as the best of his career. Had impressed with his defending too – 8 . Phil Jagielka is mobbed by his Everton team-mates after levelling the scoring in the closing stages . John Stones – Easy to see why he is being touted as a future England central defender. Composed throughout, worked well with Jagielka – 7 . Leighton Baines – Mixed bag from the left-back, some good moments in the first half but not so much in the second period. Energy never dropped – 6.5 . Leighton Baines, pictured challenging Adam Lallana, helped his side claim a point at Anfield . James McCarthy – Top midfielder for Everton, tackled everything that came near him and tried to drive his team forward. Passing not always the best – 7 . Gareth Barry – Had an erratic first 10 minutes when he was booked and may have been sent-off. Seemed to rattle him for the rest of the game – 5.5 . Gareth Barry was lucky to escape a second yellow card inside the opening half of Saturday's match at Anfield . Muhamed Besic – Lots of energy and hard work. Isn’t in the team to do the skilful jobs but a competent first start for Everton nonetheless – 7 . Romelu Lukaku – Played on the right of an attacking three but never made any impact after failing to get a penalty in the first couple of minutes – 5 . Steven Naismith – Been a key performer for Everton this season but he was played in a different position here and didn’t see enough of the ball – 6 . Kevin Mirallas – Was just starting to get into top gear when he damaged his hamstring midway through the first half. Looks set for a lengthy lay-off – 6 .

"Four home corners in quick succession, the injustice of a booking for crowd favourite Lee Cattermole and Angel Rangel’s soft dismissal - that was as exciting as it got on an arduous afternoon at the Stadium of Light. There was the odd half-chance – Black Cats striker Connor Wickham heading over late on – but this sour stalemate is surely a certainty to close Match of the Day. For Sunderland, their wait for a first Premier League win of the season will extend to match number seven at home to Stoke next weekend. Swansea defender Angel Rangel is shown a red card by referee Chris Foy after picking up two yellow cards in the second half of their 0-0 draw with Sunderland . Sunderland striker Connor Wickham and Swansea defender Ashley Williams get up close and personal during a fiery Premier League fixture at the Stadium of Light . SUNDERLAND (4-1-4-1): Mannone 6; Jones 6.5, O'Shea 6, Vergini 6, Van Aanholt 5.5; Cattermole 7; Johnson 5 (Alvarez 66, 6), Larsson 6, Rodwell 5.5 (Gomez 58, 6) Buckley 6.5; Wickham 5.5 (Fletcher 78). Subs: Pantilimon, Bridcutt, Altidore, Mavrias. Booked: Cattermole, Jones. SWANSEA (4-4-1-1): Fabianski 7; Rangel 6.5, Fernandez 6, Williams 7.5, Taylor 6.5; Dyer 5.5 (Montero 66, 6), Ki 7, Shelvey 6.5, Routledge 6; Sigurdsson 6.5 (Richards 82); Gomis 5 (Bony 73, 6). Subs: Emnes, Carroll, Tremmel, Bartley. Booked: Williams, Rangel. Sent off: Rangel. Referee: Chris Foy (Merseyside). Attendance: 41, 325. Man of the match: Williams. Swansea, meanwhile, may reflect on a point well earned after seeing out the final 10 minutes with 10 men, but they had shown zero ambition to emerge with anything more than a bore draw. It means Garry Monk’s men have now drawn a blank in their last two in the league and the early-season promise which saw them shoot to second on the back of three wins has somewhat faded. Sunderland boss Gus Poyet said that the outcome of back-to-back home games would tell him a lot about the campaign ahead. If this offered up any clues then it’s that boredom lies in wait. The start was ominously slow. Nathan Dyer lashed wide as the Swans, working the winger into a position of promise on the edge of the area, threatened to break the early tedium. At the other end Adam Johnson defied a narrow angle to take aim for the near post and Lukasz Fabianski was worried enough to scramble and shovel around his upright. Former Sunderland loanee Ki Sung Yueng remains a popular figure in these parts but his favour almost tumbled when he fashioned space for a shot before driving narrowly over the crossbar from 18 yards. The hosts’ best bet for a goal was in snaffling the second balls from set-pieces and Lee Cattermole hammered back into a crowd of bodies inside the six-yard area after running on to a half-cleared corner. Just seconds later defender Santiago Vergini – still lurking from the subsequent flag-kick – flashed a header on goal only for Fabianski to dive and flip around the post. The in-form Cattermole was bossing the centre of the park – strengthening his claims for an England call – but he was unfortunate to enter the book when sliding to dispossess Gylfi Sigurdsson on the stroke of half-time, the midfielder’s reputation perhaps offering reason for the harsh yellow. The injustice stirred the crowd from their slumber after what had been a low-key opening half. Swansea City boss Garry Monk is greeted by Sunderland manager Gus Poyet at the Stadium of Light in the build-up before kick-off of their Premier League clash . A feisty first-half was punctuated by a number of crunching challenges from players on both sides, including this attempt to win the ball by Swansea's Nathan Dyer . Sunderland's summer signing from Brighton, Will Buckley, impressed on the wing for Poyet's side as the hosts had the better of the first half at the Stadium of Light . Sunderland central midfielder Lee Cattermole was at his typically combative best up against the skill and guile of former Tottenham midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson . The former Middlesbrough midfielder has shown a taste for shooting from distance in recent weeks and one of his efforts flew just wide midway through the first half . The second started at much the same pedestrian pace and it took a stinging shot from 20 yards from Sigurdsson – swallowed by Vito Mannone – to spark the contest in to life. Seb Larsson tried to his best to inject some zest in to the home side’s laboured offensive effort but a purposeful burst to the by-line and laced centre was seized by Fabianski. Home winger Will Buckley opted for a similar tactic from the opposite flank but his low pull-back zipped through the six-yard area without any takers. But the best chance came the way of lone striker Wickham on 74 minutes. Larsson landed an inch-perfect delivery on his unmarked brow but the 21-year-old could only nod tamely over from six yards. Rangel then collected his first booking for tossing the ball away at a throw-in – a soft caution if ever there was one – and his second came soon after following a clumsy block on Buckley. Larsson tested Fabianski from the resulting free-kick but the Pole was never going to be beaten. Substitute Steven Fletcher then rose to nod inches wide as Poyet’s side pressed for a breakthrough. But goalless was how it eventually expired – and that was a fitting finale. Poyet bares his teeth at Sunderland right-back Billy Jones before the break at the Stadium of Light as his team struggle to create clearcut chances against Swansea . Some instinctive goalkeeping from Swansea's Polish shotstopper Lukasz Fabianski stops Jones' from prodding the ball home to put Sunderland ahead in the first half . Swansea's tricky forward Dyer gets to the byline and tries to flick a cross into the box as Sunderland's loanee full-back Patrick van Aanholt lunges in to make a block . Poyet clearly wanted more from his Sunderland side towards the end of the first half but they continued to find their way to goal blocked by a disciplined Swansea side . Sunderland midfielder Cattermole was booked for a wild lunging challenge on Sigurdsson as the Icelandic international proved too quick for the rugged Englishman .","Gus Poyet's side have lost just once this campaign but have failed to register a single win, with five draws so far .

Chievo announced the decision a day after the team was comfortably beaten 3-0 at Roma, their fifth loss in seven matches. 'It is very emotional for me,' Maran said. 'It's a double joy because I spent almost my entire playing career at Chievo Verona. Now that I'm returning as coach I hope to relive the emotions I had in those years.' Former Chievo captain Rolando Maran has taken up the reins at Stadio Marc'Antonio Bentegodi . Chievo Verona manager Eugenio Corini has been shown the door at the Serie A outfit . Maran started playing for Chievo in 1986 when the team was in Italy's fourth division and went on to make 330 appearances for the club, many as captain, helping it up to the second tier. He was also assistant manager to Silvio Baldini in 1997-98, when Chievo was in Serie B. Chievo had announced Corini's dismissal earlier in the day but had to wait until Maran resolved his contract with Catania, which sacked him last season. Corini, who was in his second spell in charge of Chievo, was the first Serie A coach to be sacked this season. Roma captain Francesco Totti and his team-mate piled the pressure on Eugenio Corini, and he was soon gone .","The Italian outfit have won just one Serie A game so far this season .

"Offer: Hafiz Saeed pledged to help the U.S. A terrorist leader with a $10million U.S. bounty on his head has offered aid to Americans hit by Superstorm Sandy. Hafiz Saeed said his organization Jamaat-ud-Dawa was prepared to send volunteers, medicine and food to those on the East Coast who were struggling to cope in the aftermath of Monday night's ferocious storm. Saeed said in a written statement on Tuesday that it is a religious duty under Islam to help Americans affected by the storm, even if the U.S. has put a bounty on his head. Following the militant's offer, the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad posted on their Twitter feed: 'We respect the Islamic tradition of help to the needy, we can't take Hafiz Saeed's offer seriously.

"Louis van Gaal might have given his players a thumbs up at the end of another frenetic encounter, but it remains as much about crisis management as football management for the Dutchman at Manchester United. He did his best to deny that at Old Trafford yesterday, daring to suggest Wayne Rooney received a red card for nothing more than ‘a professional foul’ and refusing to respond to the idea that it might have been a mistake to make him captain. It was neither a good question, nor a good analysis of Rooney’s challenge on Stewart Downing, the Dutchman said. Even if Downing was deep in his own half, and 70 yards from United’s goal, when Rooney decided to plant his right foot in the West Ham midfielder’s thigh.

Booked: Song, Sakho. Referee: L Mason. Man of the match Blind. ‘Crazy’ was how many saw it, but not Van Gaal. No, like Rooney, he somehow saw danger in Downing’s run. He was taken down because he needed to be, United’s manager essentially argued, with Rooney’s only mistake being the over-zealous nature of the tackle. More seasoned Rooney watchers will have a different view of the sixth red card of his career. We have seen this before; a senseless, seemingly unprovoked moment of madness that normally succeeds only in leaving a manager wondering if this hugely gifted footballer can be trusted. But even by Rooney’s standards this was extraordinary; enough surely to alarm a watching Roy Hodgson however blasé Van Gaal might have claimed to be about it. In the end, in the isolated context of this game, it mattered not. The advantage United secured with first-half goals from Rooney and Robin van Persie was enough to see off a spirited West Ham side.

Alexandre Song     90            10.7    6.6 . But Van Gaal must now prepare for three games, one at home against Everton and another against league leaders Chelsea at Old Trafford, without his captain at a time when leadership on the pitch is almost as important as the guidance he continues to provide off it. It was already proving another uncomfortable spectacle for Van Gaal as his side swung almost as violently between rapidly executed attacks and anxiety attacks at the opposite end of the field. But attacks of a purely physical nature are the last thing he needs, when Rooney is so central a figure in a team still struggling to overcome the imbalance created by a brilliant forward line and an inexperienced defence. In fairness to those charged with the task of defending United’s goal yesterday, they actually did rather well in the end. They were aided by the poor quality of West Ham’s finishing, but it was an improvement on last Sunday’s debacle at Leicester. Patrick McNair, a 19-year-old from Northern Ireland, impressed on his debut in a back four boasting another debutant in Luke Shaw as well as a centre-half — Marcos Rojo — making only his third appearance for the club. If anything, McNair looked more assured than the more experienced Argentinian and was responsible for a marvellous headed clearance late in the second half. Going forward, of course, United remain excellent, with Rooney outstanding at times in this game. It actually made his clash with Downing all the more bizarre. He should have been celebrating the 10th anniversary of his United debut with a fine performance as well as a goal that lifts him to third in the all-time list for the Premier League. United started, much as they did at Leicester last week, with what amounted to a commanding attacking display that simply proved too much for their opponents.

Manchester United's Robin van Persie celebrates after scoring against West Ham . They were ahead after only five minutes, Rooney meeting a bouncing cross from Rafael with a marvellous first-time strike that curled beyond the reach of keeper Adrian. No sooner had United’s captain settled the nerves at Old Trafford, however, than a defensive error very nearly led to an equaliser for the visitors. A poorly directed backpass from an otherwise impressive Daley Blind suddenly invited Enner Valencia to strike, but the West Ham forward blasted over. It was a combination of defensive errors that then enabled Van Persie to double United’s lead in the 22nd minute. A poor clearance from Adrian was compounded when Alex Song lost possession to Ander Herrera. He passed to Radamel Falcao, who in turn found Van Persie with a superb pass. Even then, though, Winston Reid was too hesitant in challenging Van Persie and the Dutchman beat Adrian with a delightful right-foot strike.

Angel di Maria really should have made it 3-0 but sent an effort wide and the mistake was made to feel all the more costly when Diafra Sakho seized on the mess United made of defending a Downing corner in the 37th minute. David de Gea was most at fault for flapping ineffectively at the ball under pressure from Morgan Amalfitano, and after Valencia saw his initial header bounce off the crossbar Sakho was there to pounce with a more accurate effort. De Gea made amends when he denied Sakho after the break, and in the end credit should be given to a makeshift defence that just about protected that one-goal margin. But Van Gaal will also know Sam Allardyce’s side were not as impressive as they had been against Liverpool the previous week. West Ham’s manager was also bitterly disappointed with his side’s failure to take advantage of Rooney’s red card. Afterwards Allardyce also blamed the match officials for ruling that Kevin Nolan was offside when he converted Carl Jenkinson’s cross from close range with little more than a minute remaining. It was certainly a close call from the officials which, on another day, could have gone in the visitors’ favour. To be fair to Allardyce, his argument was nothing like as bizarre as his opposite number’s.","Wayne Rooney received a straight red card after he lashed out at West Ham midfielder Stewart Downing .

"Taxi app Hailo is leaving America's shores in the face of competition from ridesharing services Uber and Lyft, the company announced Tuesday. The company was founded in 2011 in London but struggled to gain a foothold in the United States against well-funded competitors. The company also announced that founder Jay Bregman had left the company, though specific reasons for his departure were not given. Fail: London-based Hailo is pulling out of the United States, where it worked hard to enter the New York taxi market while running up against well-funded competition and regulators . When Hailo waded into the crowded American market, the company was looking to distinguish itself by connecting users to yellow taxis instead of coordinating with livery cab drivers. But The Verge reported that in New York the company faced a battle with the Taxi and Limousine Commission, which imposed service radius and payment process restrictions. Breaking down the company's failure, Fortune said Hailo never had the numbers to make e-hailing taxis a reality. Only a 'tiny fraction' of New York's 40,000 registered cab drivers signed up to work for the service, and cabbies said they were suspicious of the company. Hailo also faced tough competitors such as Uber and Lyft, who are now mainly competing against each other by throwing their financial heft around. CEO Tom Barr blamed the departure on the 'astronomical marketing' costs 'required to compete' against these companies. Founders: Co-founder Gary Jackson (left) in a Hailo car with chairman and co-founder Ron Zeghibe (center) in London. Another co-founder, Jay Bregman, abruptly left Hailo, the company announced . 'Profitability for any one player is almost impossible,' warned Barr. Hailo, which was funded to the tune of $100million, was facing off against Uber, who recently closed a round of financing at $1.2billion. As for Bregman, he had been scheduled to speak at a tech conference in London before news of his departure. Barr said that Bregman 'by his own admissions has taken the business to the level he can.' Hailo will now turn its focus on the European and Asian markets, planning to expand next into Singapore. Justin Raymond, formerly president of Hailo Canada, had announced he was trying to work out a licensing deal to continue the service in Toronto, according to TechCrunch, but the company said they would not be negotiating such a deal.","Hailo tried to establish itself as an app for e-hailing taxis, but ran up against regulation and established ridesharing apps .

"An investigation has been launched after an animal rights group released disturbing footage purporting to show dairy cows wading knee deep through thousands of gallons of their own manure. The group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) said the 'sick and emaciated' cows are forced to stand in the manure for hours even when they are being milked and fed at a North Carolina dairy farm.

Disturbing: Dairy cows are filmed trudging through manure in the video released by animal rights group Peta . The North Carolina Department of Agriculture confirmed Inspectors visited the farm last week after receiving Peta’s complaint but found only minor violations. Spokesman Brian Long said loose ceiling tiles and rusted metal were discovered in the milking parlour but nothing was found that would constitute a public health hazard. He told the Charlotte Observer: 'That area was not similar to what was depicted in some parts of that video,'  Inspectors are due to return to the dairy. Local officials reportedly said wet weather had hampered the farmer's ability to keep stalls and runways clear leading to some house cleaning issues. Many within the industry have . suggested that the video is a set-up with Peta, which is well known for . using shocking publicity stunts, accused of misleading the public. Skeptics point out that far from looking emaciated and sick, the animals appear in good health. Health: Peta described the animals as being 'sick and emaciated' and claimed they were forced to stand in the manure even when being fed and milked . Dairy cows eat while standing in gallons of their own manure. Local officials blamed wet weather which they claimed led to house cleaning issues' After viewing the video dairy farmer Carrie Mess wrote on her blog: 'When I look beyond the manure I see a group of cows that are clean when if they were living in this barn they would be filthy from head to toe. 'I see a feed area with not a scrap of feed in it and my experience in dealing with manure tells me that this stuff has been moved around recently. 'While I don’t know this farmer and I don’t know the story about what’s going on here, to me it looks like these cows were paraded through this area for the purpose of making this video.'

The group's investigator Dan Peden . said he found a document a few days ago at the Osborne dairy that showed . a shipment of milk was headed to Piedmont Milk's bulk tank in Hickory. He said a Piedmont Milk sales rep told them the plant supplies 'milk exclusively to Harris Teeter.' But . Harris Teeter communications manager Catherine Becker said that the . grocery chain's supplier, Piedmont Milk Sales Inc., doesn't receive milk . from the dairy farm.

"New Zealand may vote next year on changing its flag, scrubbing out the red, white and blue of the Union Flag to break its ties with Britain. The country's newly re-elected prime minister, John Key, made the revelation today as the country looks to assert an identity independent of its former colonial overlord. Key's centre-right government was returned for a third three year term on Saturday in a resounding win, promising to continue steady economic management and controls on spending, and possible tax cuts in three years. Flag change? The current flag was adopted at the start of the 20th century and features the British Union Flag in the top-left corner with the four red stars of the Southern Cross on a blue background . Asked about his promise of a referendum on a change of flag, Key said he wanted it to be the subject of a referendum next year, including finding an alternative and then putting that up against the current flag. 'I'm obviously a big supporter of the change, I think there are a lot of strong arguments in favour of the change,' he said on the Radio Live network. Key has previously said he wants a flag uniquely New Zealand in character that would be recognisable around the world. Changing history: John Key's centre-right government was returned for a third three year term on Saturday in a resounding win. But Key, who has backed a new flag with a silver fern on a black background, acknowledged there would be strong arguments to retain the current flag . All black: New Zealand sports teams, notably the world champion All Blacks rugby team, often compete under a silver fern motif, and the national carrier Air New Zealand has put it on its aircraft tails . Compromise: People have come up with various suggestions for a new New Zealand flag over tthe years, like this by Aaron Nicholson in 2000 made as a 'compromise', but none have ever gained traction . In 2009, a flag was devised which incorporated both the Union Flag and New Zealand's national colours, black and white. The red is the colour of the Maori people of the country. Eleven years earlier, something similar was designed with a silver fern (right) In 2005, a red,white and blue flag was devised by Kyle Lockwood (left). The blue colour represents the ocean, the red represents the Maori and the blood of soldiers, and white is a reference to the 'Land of the Long White Cloud'. But some have suggested just getting rid of the Union Flag (right) The Koru Flag (left) has been proposed as a secondary flag for New Zealand, designed by Friedensreich Hundertwasser in 1983. It has a black stripe on the left to represent the Maori and a green curling fern. Then there is the Tino rangatiratanga flag, the Maori national flag (right) The current flag was adopted at the start of the 20th century and features the British Union Flag in the top-left corner with the four red stars of the Southern Cross on a blue background. It is often confused with the similar looking Australian flag. Key, who has backed a new flag with a silver fern on a black background, acknowledged there would be strong arguments to retain the current flag. The group representing returned soldiers has been a vocal opponent of change, saying the move would disrespect those who had fought and died defending it.

"Bungling Thai police  are to force every man on  Koh Tao to take a DNA test as the fiasco of an investigation into the murders of two British tourists on the island appeared to dry up. Hannah Witheridge, 23, and David Miller, 24, were found bludgeoned to death with a garden hoe on the beach on September 15. Police had said their prime suspect was a fisherman who had already fled the island on a private boat. Scroll down for video . Killed: Backpacker Hannah Witheridge, 23, was found bludgeoned to death with a garden hoe alongside David Miller, 24,  on the beach of Koh Tao on September 15 . My hero: It comes as Mr Miller's father said his son died a hero, trying to help fellow victim Miss Witheridge . But today they said they wanted to swab every man across the island including fishermen and boat drivers who may have visited the area at the time of the killings, the BBC reported. Initial tests show DNA samples found on the bodies almost certainly came from two Asian men, though detectives now believe at least three people were involved in the attack. But Thai police said they 'still believe sexual jealousy is at the heart of this crime'. Colonel Kissana Phathanachareon cited 'fresh evidence which could lead to a new suspect who may have had a relationship or one-night stand with Hannah or one of her friends or David'. The Bangkok Post last night reported police had narrowed their inquiry to two suspects – a Thai national and a Burmese worker. Desperate: They said they wanted to swab every man across the island including fishermen and boat drivers who may have visited the island at the time of the killings . Picturesque: Police have come under fire for their handling of the case which critics say has descended into chaos . Sea police have been dispatched to check fishing boats operating around the paradise isle amid reports the British pair had been arguing with a group of local men in a bar shortly before they were killed. Sept. 15 - The bodies of Hannah Witheridge and David Miller are found shortly before 5am, bludgeoned to death with a hoe found nearby. Sept. 15 - Police say culprit could not be Thai and reveal they are hunting a British man said to have left the island on the first boat to the mainland. Sept. 16 - CCTV images of what police described as an Asian-looking man are released. They say they are focusing their probe on the Burmese community. Sept. 16 - Seemingly random DNA samples taken from five Burmese men do not match any found on the victims' bodies. Sept. 17 - Police stop brothers Christopher and James Ware at Bangkok International airport as they reportedly prepare to leave the country. Police call them 'possible suspects'. Sept. 18 - The Ware brothers are both released without charge. Sept. 18 - Police admit they are struggling to find the killers after it emerged crime scene DNA did not match that of any suspect. Sept 19 - Police return focus on the Burmese communities, checking their documents and searching their homes. Sept. 19 - Police admit culprit may be Thai after all. It emerges people were not stopped from leaving the isle after murders, sparking fears killer may be far away. Sept. 21 - Police say they have narrowed their inquiry to two suspects – a Thai national and a Burmese worker. CCTV of suspect is released. Sept. 21 - It's claimed the pair may have been arguing with a local gangster on the night of their murders. Sept. 22 - Police say they will test DNA of every man on island. Police have come under fire for their handling of the case which critics say has descended into chaos. Local media in particular have turned on their force, claiming its incompetence stretches way beyond this investigation. The Thai capital's top-selling English-language newspaper, The Bangkok Post, wrote in an editorial today: 'The handling of the investigation into the murders of British tourists Hannah Witheridge and David Miller on Koh Tao is an international scandal and should be a source of deep embarrassment. 'And it would be, except the egregious lack of professionalism displayed in this case is par for the course for the Thai police force.' Nevertheless, the commander in charge of the police force sought yesterday to reassure the public that everything was under control.' Please have confidence in the work of the police. Now we are receiving full cooperation from all parties, especially locals and operators on Koh Tao who keep supplying clues,' Surat Thani police commander Maj Gen Kiatipong Khaosam-ang told the Bangkok post. It comes as Mr Miller's father said his son died a hero, trying to help fellow victim Miss Witheridge. Ian Miller said last night that his 'wonderful boy' was probably killed attempting to save the 23-year-old. 'It has become clearer and clearer that it is quite likely David was stepping in to help a girl who was in trouble,' the 57-year-old, from St Helier in Jersey, said. 'That would be absolutely in his character.' He spoke as it emerged Miss Witheridge may have been raped by two local men before she was killed on Koh Tao island. The bodies of the students, who were staying in the same apartment complex, were found last Monday on Sairee Beach. Miss Witheridge, from Great Yarmouth in Norfolk, was bludgeoned with a hoe found nearby while Mr Miller, 24, was battered with an unknown 'metal weapon'. DNA from Miss Witheridge's body came from two Asian men – but did not match any of 12 suspects. It is claimed she may have spoken with her attackers before being dragged to her death, with Mr Miller killed after coming to her aid. Officers said it appeared one killer had left his blue shorts at the scene, putting on Mr Miller's 'better quality' beige pair. Night before: Dressed in a pink top and white skirt, Hannah Witheridge looked happy and relaxed as she strolled past fruit stands and in and out of bars . Running man: Police are hunting this man filmed running frantically away from the beach on the night of the murders . Last night James Isaacs, a tourist, claimed two British women were recently mugged by a Thai motorbike gang at the spot where the bodies were found. Mr Miller, a businessman, said the family has not been kept informed by Thai police. He added: 'We have had very little information here about how they are getting on there. We know they are busy but we haven't got any inside track.'","Hannah Witheridge, 23, and David Miller, 24, murdered on September 15 .

"A wheelchair-bound pensioner suffering from the muscle-wasting disease that inspired the 'ice bucket challenge' phenomenon is claiming thousands of pounds from Germany's most famous folk singer because she laughed at him during a concert. Austrian Heimo Eitel, 62, says his amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) became worse after Helene Fischer mocked him in front of thousands of fellow fans - and wants £15,700 in compensation from the star. He alleges that his ordeal began when he approached the star during a gig to offer he a present as she performed at the concert on the floating stage at Moerbisch am See, a town in the east Austrian state of Burgenland. Humiliated: Heimo Eitel, 62, says his Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) became worse after Helene Fischer mocked him in front of thousands of fellow fans . A huge fan of the singer, he had been waiting in his wheelchair with other admirers to give her three books, but instead of taking them when she saw him she had apparently laughed. Popular: Helene Fischer is one of the most successful musicians in Germany and has sold more than 9,115,000 albums . Now he is demanding £15,700 for the insult as Europol officers allegedly hunt for her because she had not made her address available to the court in order for the paperwork to be served, including the request that she attend the court hearing. Europol is the European Union's law enforcement agency usually seen assisting the European Union's Member States in their fight against serious international crime and terrorism. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder with various causes that recently shot to public prominence after it was a subject of a popular charity fundraising event known as the 'ice bucket challenge', with most of the money raised going to ALS sufferers. ALS is characterised by muscle spasticity, and rapidly progressive weakness due to muscle wasting. This results in difficulty speaking, swallowing, and breathing, and in the case of Heimo it got significantly worse after his embarrassment at his alleged bad treatment by the German celebrity. His lawyer, Astrid Wagner, who said she was shocked when she reviewed the details of the case, claims she is confident of successfully representing her client and said there was plenty of proof that his condition had worsened significantly since the insult. She filed charges after Fischer failed to appear at an arbitration hearing to see if the matter could be settled out of court. Fischer's only comment on the incident is to say that she did not regard herself as a person who would discriminate against anybody in 'any way, shape or form'.

"A French anarchist charged with several attempted murders after a newspaper photographer was shot is said to be on hunger strike. French newspapers reported yesterday that Abedlhakim . Dekhar, 48 - who is accused of a string of shootings in Paris - has begun refusing food. Sources said he is drinking water, but has so far refused to explain his actions or even spoken to police. Scroll down for video . Assaulted ex-partner: Paris 'shotgun shooter' Abdelhakim Dekhar, seen here on CCTV at the Concorde underground station, was convicted of domestic violence in Britain before returning to France . The French . Algerian extremist is the suspect in shootings last week at the offices of the Liberation newspaper, television station BFM TV and a bank. He is also believed to have forced a driver to take him into central Paris. Dekhar, who fled to England in 1999 after a jail term for supplying a weapon to two infamous . French murderers, was charged on Saturday with several attempted murders and a kidnapping lasting fewer than seven days. After a two-day manhunt, police found Dekhar semi-conscious in a parking garage after a suicide attempt. He had a letter with him that spoke of fascist plots - and criticised capitalism and supposed media manipulation. Dekhar fled to England in 1999 to escape surveillance by French authorities after he served four years for supplying a weapon to revolutionaries Florence Rey and Audry Maupin - nicknamed 'France's Bonnie and Clyde' - who murdered three policemen and a taxi driver.

He continued to live in England, where he also worked in a restaurant until July this year. His sister Farida Dekhar-Powell still lives in the Essex commuter town of Shenfield and teaches French. She said: ‘I stopped talking to him 20 years ago. He is not part of my life and that's how it stays.’ Dekhar . was arrested in an underground car park on Wednesday night after taking . an overdose of sleeping pills in Bois-Colombes, a Paris suburb.

"Saudi Arabia has been pitched into moral uproar after a female spectator was caught on camera cheering for a Saudi football team. The woman, dressed in a black abaya robe and niqab face covering, is seen shouting in frustration at a bad tackle during a match between Saudia Arabia's Al Hilal and United Arab Emirates' Al Ain. As she shakes her fist in anger at the unsportsmanlike behaviour on pitch, her sleeve rides up and exposes much of her lower arm. Scroll down for video . Saudi woman take a selfie at the AFC Champions League semi-final football match between UAE's Al-Ain club and Saudi Al-Hilal: There was uproar when a video clip showed a woman cheering on the Saudi club . A clip of the moment has already been viewed more than 400,00 times on YouTube, and attracted a storm of angry comments, mostly from men furious to see women watching the game. 'Women aren't interested in football, so why go to a stadium to watch a live match?' wrote one, in Arabic comments translated by BBC News. 'Does this woman not have a man? Her place is in the house,' pronounced another, echoing a general consensus that these women had ventured into a world where they don't belong. Women are banned from going to football matches in Saudi Arabia, and had Al-Hilal been playing at their home stadium in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, there is now way they could have attended. But the team were playing away at Al Ain's stadium in Abu Dhabi, where laws are not so strict. The gender segregation laws in Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil producer and a key ally of the West, are based on a particularly extreme interpretation of Islamic Sharia law. The absolute monarchy is the only country in the world where women are legally banned from driving and, until recently, voting and being elected to political office. All females must have a male guardian, typically a father, brother or husband, without whose permission they can't travel, get a job, conduct official business like opening bank accounts, or even have certain medical procedures. Laws are mostly unwritten, so the exclusively male judges have a lot of discretionary power which they usually exercise in favour of conservative tribal customs. According to local newspaper reports, the Saudi government is considering modifying stadia with separate sections for women.","Women are banned from going to football stadiums in Saudi Arabia .

"If you thought airport security was bad enough – be warned that it’s about to get a whole lot tougher. New covert scanners designed to detect radioactive ‘dirty bombs’ and DIY biological weapons are to be introduced in airports disguised as queue barriers. The latest technology - the workings of which remains a secret - look like typical barrier poles which are linked together by roll-out ribbons, used to guide queuing passengers through departure lounges into security. Security controls at airports  have been stepped up in the last decade, with body scanners, such as this one in Germany's Hamburg airport, showing full body images . The scanners are among a display of the latest new security equipment being showcased at the week-long Farnborough International Air Show where organisers have created a realistic mock-up check-in security zone and departure lounge containing the new devices. It is the latest technology – much of it still secret –  developed to help combat the anticipated growing terror threat in the run up to the London 2012 Olympics and beyond. The airport security stand allows the show’s expected quarter of a million visitors  to experience a practical ‘walk-through’ test of new technology from the moment a passenger arrives at check-in to deposit hold luggage before going through security with or without carry-on hand baggage. The radiation detectors are an example of some of the most sophisticated technology to be developed for security purposes. They scan unwary passengers for traces of radioactivity to deter attacks from a ‘dirty bomb’ whose contamination effects could last for years. The radiation detection unit sits near the top of the 3ft high 2.5 inch diameter pole,  just beneath the roll-out extendable belt mechanism. The battery to power it sits in the weighted base. It can send warnings wirelessly via wi-fi to a central control unit. Poles can be linked via wi-fi to track a suspect emitting radiation. The poles can also be hard-wired in using an Ethernet cable from under the floor. Full body scans are now a common addition to security controls at international airports . The time taken to detect and identify radioactive traces on people or in packages can range from a few seconds to 20 to 30 seconds, depending on the type of radioactive isotope being checked. The covert barrier-pole detectors, called ‘Stride’, are produced by security firm FLIR which is also responsible for the mock-up airport lounge in which they feature. Publicity material for the devices notes: ‘The covert movement of special nuclear material or weapons into populated areas represents possibly the greatest threat to  the security of our world. ‘Identification systems are required to effectively detect and deter this threat. They must recognise the presence or movement of radioactive materials across borders.’ A Farnborough International Air Show spokesman said: ‘These disguised poles or bollards monitor passengers for traces of radiation, scanning them for nuclear material, components or weaponry . ‘The main risk is radioactive materials which may be used to contaminate an area or combined with conventional explosives to create a so-called ‘dirty bomb.' He said the scanners detect and nuclear or radioactive material which might be used to make a so-called dirty bomb which could shut down an airport and contaminate it for years. Once they detect radioactivity an alarm goes off on the central control centre. Steve Williams, business development officer for FLIR said: 'The poles can alert security forces to the fact that someone is carrying traces of radioactive materials through an airport. Working together, they can also track them.' He said the sensors are so sensitive they can even tell whether a person has had radiation treatment, such as in a hospital, to potentially eliminate them from suspicion. Technology to combat a potentially deadly biological threat is also on display on the FLIR stand. Aerosol detectors monitor the airport’s air for airborne biological  threats such as anthrax, plague bacteria, smallpox viruses or deadly ricin poison. If detected, the system immediately shuts down the air conditioning system and seals of rooms and lounges to contain the toxic threat and prevent it spreading across an entire airport or being carried onto planes while decontamination takes place. Also on show in the mock-up airport security lounge are: . The lounge also includes a special ‘command and control’ centre which collects data and images  from all the scanners, cameras and radar detectors, giving overview of whole airport security. There are even details of new hi-tech cameras mounted on the perimeter of airport and even  in the sky on planes monitoring the ground below. Full-body scanners were introduced in 2010 and now the next-generation of scanner are being showcased at Farnborough . The Farnborough International Airshow spokesman said: ‘Airport security and immigration issues are back at the top of the agenda as unprecedented numbers of visitors will descend on London for the Olympic Games over the next few weeks, testing airport security systems to the maximum. ‘The very latest cutting edge detection and surveillance technology, due to be installed at major airports around the world in the coming years, will be on show this week at  Farnborough. These innovations will shape everyone’s experience of air travel for years to come.’ All such devices undergo testing by government authorities before being approved for use in UK airports. More than 250,000 people are expected to attend the Farnborough air show including airline and aircraft industry bosses, space agencies such as NASA and European Space Agency, military, and the general public at the weekend only . It also marks the UK debut of  a mock-up of Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic Space Ship 2 which aims to put civilians into space. The show  runs until Friday for trade visitors  and is open to the public on Saturday and Sunday.

"Daily Mail undercover reporter Ryan Kisiel G4S security services training centre in east London . Such is the desperation of G4S bosses to fill security places that when I walked into their Olympic base I was signed up to a training course within 90 seconds. Once inside, utter confusion reigned in the makeshift centre in the shadow of the Olympic Park. I had arrived shortly before 9am on Thursday posing as an unemployed man seeking work as a security guard. With no checks or questions, I was whisked into a large lecture hall with 130 other people and a woman demanding to see my passport. ‘Passport, name, date of birth,’ she barked. I handed it over. I was now officially signed up to complete a course to become a security guard. Teams of women were frantically stuffing envelopes and desperately shouting just to get the huge herd of people processed without any attempt to check if they were meant to be there. In what is supposed to be the most secure Olympics in history, I had managed to simply waltz in and register to be one of those given the huge responsibility of helping guard it. I could have been a terrorist or a convicted criminal. While later detailed investigations may have exposed my true identity, with the rush to approve the thousands of security applications in just days, it is possible I could have slipped through the net. During my day’s training I witnessed the absolute administrative chaos and the poor calibre of candidates who could hardly fill out basic forms, let alone stay awake during the day. The hall in the University of East London was filled with lots of people in their late teens and early twenties who had been largely signed up straight from college and Jobcentres. These would make up the bulk of ‘perimeter security’, with the crucial job of guarding entrances, exits and borders of the events, making sure nothing was smuggled in. The trainer who ran the course warned us not to fall asleep as we were ‘getting paid to attend’. Staggeringly, five people did doze off and had to be abruptly woken up; someone the previous week was caught doing his college homework. It took the class around an hour to . fill out the basic Security Industry Authority application form that . asked only for name, age and address. It was made easier as the . supervisor filled it out on a big screen with us line by line. Two . men on last week’s course had to leave after admitting they were . awaiting criminal trials; others were removed after declaring past . convictions. One . man, originally from East Africa, could hardly read or write English . and had to be helped to fill out his form personally, but still managed . to write his date of birth down so it made him six months old. Three . boys aged 18 from the local sixth-form college slumped in the back row . and were continually told off for not taking their baseball caps off and . for spitting in the street outside during ‘smoke breaks’. Unqualified: Most of the applicants appeared to be  people in their late teens and early twenties who had been signed up straight from college and Jobcentres . Training? The door supervisors' handbook given reporter Ryan. Some of the applicants couldn't read or write English . Yesterday, I arrived at 7.30am to fill out the last admin documents and produce utility bills to prove my address and was allowed straight in. Eight people were later thrown off the course – seven for arriving more than an hour late and one who had ‘altered’ something on his passport overnight before handing it in. In an attempt to get people ‘switched on’, the class was told that some security staff had already been sacked – including one for committing a vile act in the aquatic centre. During the day, my name was read out from the list to complete the course’s 40-minute multiple choice exam. I asked a manager what the test was like. He quipped: ‘If you don’t pass it you’re a remedial as the questions are like: Is a security operator a) someone who carries out security duties at a licensed premises, b) a milkman or c) a pilot.’ I wished he was wrong – there were people on our course repeating it after failing the exam the week before. Falling short: G4S admitted it could not supply the 10,000 guards it promised to deliver .","Ryan Kisiel posed as unemployed man seeking work as a security guard .

I didn’t have my glasses on so I put them on and checked two or three more times.” He said he informed his mother, with whom he lives in Camden, north London. “I said ‘I think I’ve won the lottery’,” he said. “She said ‘give over, it’s too early in the morning for jokes like that’.” After telling his mother not to throw the winning ticket away, he reported for his 5am shift. Mr Whiting decided to buy a ticket at the last minute at around 7.15pm - nine minutes before the draw closes . “I still didn’t believe it,” said the father of three. “I said ‘I’m going to leave the ticket here and I’m going to work’. “I don’t know how I got through the day. My mind was all over the place. You can check 100 times and you are still not sure.” Finally he got home and contacted Camelot, who confirmed the win. He said: “Even now it hasn’t sunk in.” He quit the job he has done for 14 years today, leaving the brooms behind. “My line manager was made up for me,” he said. “I enjoy it, it isn’t a bad job and I work with a good team. However, I won’t miss getting up at 4am.” Mr Whiting almost missed out when a relative offered to buy a load of bread, meaning he did not need to go to the shop. He decided to buy a ticket at the last minute at around 7.21pm - 9 minutes before the draw closes. “It must have been fate, I shouldn’t have gone out, and still don’t know why I got up and decided to go.” Now he is planning to use his winnings to take driving lessons, buy a bigger house and go on holiday with his children - two girls and a boy - with a trip to Disneyland possibly on the horizon. He is also keen on a season ticket to follow his beloved Arsenal but admitted: “I think there’s a bit of a waiting list.” Mr Whiting would like to buy a season ticket for the best team in north London .","Joseph Whiting checked his tickets at 4am and then turned up to clean the streets in north London as usual .

"'A lot in common': John Cleese with fourth wife Jennifer (left) and 30-year-old daughter Camilla . By her own admission, she and her father don’t always see eye-to-eye when it comes to her work. And when John Cleese’s daughter Camilla unveiled her latest stand-up show, it wasn’t difficult to see why. The 30-year-old comic devoted almost half of her set to making jokes at the expense of her 74-year-old father – and his wives. As well as describing the Monty Python star’s current wife Jennifer Wade, 42, as ‘a child’ and his ‘soul mate du jour’, Miss Cleese referred to his third wife, Alyce Faye Eichelberger, as ‘Lucifer’, or the devil. She also likened her family to tumbleweed ‘rolling along picking up dirt and debris’. Miss Cleese – whose mother is the late American artist Barbara Trentham, her father’s second wife – told a sold-out crowd at Edinburgh Fringe Festival: ‘I’m still single and it’s weird because my parents set an amazing example. ‘They’ve been married for almost 42 years – to seven different people. Not at the same time, we’re not Mormon or anything like that, not even close. ‘If most people have a family tree, we have a family tumbleweed, it just keeps rolling along picking up dirt and debris, nobody knows how they are related to anyone else, we just know not to f*** each other, because we’re not Mormon.’ The 6ft 1in comedienne then turned her attention to Miss Wade, who became Cleese’s fourth wife two years ago, saying:  ‘Recently I got a surprise, we got a new child in the family, it’s pretty cool, my new step-mum. 'Soul mate du jour': Miss Cleese described her father's current wife Jennifer (left), 42, as 'a child' ‘My dad, about two years ago, married . lucky number four, his soulmate du jour. She’s great, we actually have a . lot in common – we’re both six foot, blonde and inappropriately aged to . be married to my dad. But she’s really nice and I’m not, so that’s . different.’ Miss Cleese saved some particularly barbed jibes for Miss Eichelberger, 69, who she dubbed ‘Lucy … fer’ – leaving the audience in no doubt that she was making a reference to Lucifer, or Satan. Miss Eichelberger’s £12million settlement in her 2008 divorce from Cleese forced the comedian to come out of retirement and launch his Alimony Tour, and Miss Cleese has previously accused her of driving a wedge between her and her father during their marriage. While Miss Cleese couched her jokes about Miss Wade in some compliments, no such courtesy was reserved for Miss Eichelberger during the 11-minute set on Wednesday night. Criticism: Miss Cleese referred to his third wife, Alyce Faye Eichelberger (left), as 'Lucifer', or the devil . On screen: Miss Cleese's father has had four wives - including Fawlty Towers actress Connie Booth (pictured) She said: ‘Because [Miss Wade] is now officially a Cleese, I call her the worst possible thing a 30-year old-woman can call a woman in her early 40s in public: mum. Daughter: Miss Cleese likened her family to tumbleweed 'rolling along picking up dirt and debris' ‘She is so much cooler than the last one. Her name was Lucy … fer. She was a treat. ‘She had two sons who were both horrible people and they were up in Texas, it’s weird,  we have nothing in common,  we were related I guess but not any more. ‘One of them, Martin, he’s colour blind, he can’t see colour at all, don’t get me wrong, he’s super racist. He’s just red-green colour blind, I guess he just sees shades of grey, so to him, Christmas is just one big f*** you. ‘So, a few years ago for Christmas I gave him a Rubik’s cube, now he thinks he’s like  world champion, he tells everyone that. ‘I guess it just p***** me off because my parents have always said he was the gifted one and it’s messed up because if you think about it people say a child is a gift, right? So, technically, all children are gifted, even me.’ The comedienne – she is a regular on the US stand-up circuit but this is her first UK show – has collaborated with her father on several occasions, co-writing a stage version of his hit 1988 film A Fish Called Wanda and also his 2011 Alimony Tour. However, her deeply personal new material might explain why, in a recent interview, she revealed that her stand-up is the ‘one thing [she and her father] don’t always see eye-to-eye on’. Miss Cleese has previously discussed . how she was a ‘nightmare’ teenager, falling from  being a top student . and champion show jumper to being a homeless addict. It . took ‘five-ish’ trips to rehab and a tough-love approach from her . parents – Cleese cut off all support and contact from his daughter – . before she finally gave up alcohol and rebuilt her life. Although Miss Cleese was born in the UK, she has spent much for her life in America and currently lives in Los Angeles. Her . latest show, American … ish, consists of four US-based comedians . performing short sets. It runs every night at the festival until next . Wednesday. She made a . tentative start to her comedy career, aware that she was receiving more . scrutiny than her peers because of her father.

Her father has had four wives – Fawlty Towers actress Connie Booth, then Miss Trentham, Miss Eichelberger and now Miss Wade . Miss Cleese’s mother Miss Trentham had three husbands. Before Cleese, she married Giles Trentham, a fellow student at Oxford University, and retained his name after their divorce in 1970. Her marriage to Cleese broke down in 1990, and she later tied the knot again with barrister George Covington. Miss Cleese has one biological sibling, her half-sister Cynthia Cleese, 43, from Cleese’s marriage to Miss Booth.","Camilla Cleese, 30, makes jokes at expense of father at Edinburgh Fringe .

"The competition included a bear in wellington boots, pink aliens from outer space and a builder called Bob. But when viewers were asked to choose their favourite BBC children’s character of all time, there was only one who was considered the best in his field – Shaun the Sheep. The mischievous sheep knocked Postman Pat and Sooty & Sweep into second and third place respectively, despite only hitting screens with his own show in 2007. He first appeared in the Oscar-winning Wallace and Gromit film A Close Shave in 1995. Shaun the Sheep was voted the top BBC children's character in the poll followed by Postman Pat and Sooty & Sweep who were second and third . Ben Preston, Radio Times editor, said Shaun the Sheep's victory was a 'testament to the enduring quality of British children's television' The poll, by Radio Times and the British Film Institute, saw 41,000 people vote for their favourite from a shortlist of 50, all of which were either cartoon characters or puppets. The results reveal the top three stars from each decade from the 1950s onwards, as well as the most popular for the entire period. Richard Starzak, creator of the Shaun The Sheep television show, said: ‘Many BBC animated characters were a big and important part of my childhood. It’s amazing to think Shaun will be part of so many people’s happy memories.’ Postman Pat came second in the poll which saw 41,000 people vote for their favourite character from a list of 50, all of which were either cartoon characters or puppets . Radio Times and the British Film Institute did the poll . The series has won two Emmy awards and a Bafta for its 130 episodes. Postman Pat starred in 141 episodes between 1981 and 2008 detailing his adventures in the village of Greendale. Sooty and Sweep, the puppet bear and dog who communicate through a series of squeaks, have been an almost constant presence on children’s television for nearly 60 years. Their show was broadcast by the BBC from 1955 until 1967 and then moved to ITV. Justin Johnson, a children’s TV expert at the BFI, said Shaun the Sheep, Postman Pat and Sooty & Sweep are set apart from their contemporaries by how ‘likeable’ they are. He said: ‘None of them are fantastical sci-fi characters, they are very every day, people can relate to them. ‘With Postman Pat and Sooty & Sweep there is the nostalgia value, parents loved the characters so they want their children to as well. But nostalgia only works so far. 'For these three shows, their strength is fundamentally the quality of the storytelling, that’s what children and parents react to.’ Ben Preston, Radio Times editor, said: ‘It’s a testament to the enduring quality of British children’s television that a contemporary character topped the poll in a shortlist filled with classic programmes from the last seven decades.’","Shaun the Sheep first hit the screens in Wallace and Gromit film A Close Shave in 1995 .

"Mishal Husain joined Radio 4’s Today in October and brought a surge in listeners, but now 400,000 appear to have deserted the station . She initially prompted a spike in interest….but it appears the Mishal Husain effect is wearing off. The 41-year-old journalist joined Radio 4’s Today team in October last year and brought a surge in listeners with her. But between January and June some 400,000 appear to have deserted the station according to figures released by Rajar which monitors radio listener numbers. The data reveals that when Miss Husain joined the station’s flagship news show the 6am-9am slot – which the programme occupies from Monday to Friday – had a weekly audience of 6.81million. This shot up over the next three months (Oct to Dec) to 7.14million but between January and June it has fallen to 6.7m. Miss Husain, who has three children with her husband Meekal Hashmi, presents the show along with Sarah Montague, Jim Naughtie, Evan Davis, Justin Webb and John Humphrys, who she clashed with five years ago when he asked during a recording of Celebrity Mastermind whether she had got her job as a BBC 1 newsreader ‘because you are good-looking’. On joining Today as the breakfast news programme’s first ethnic minority presenter, she said: ‘I have long been an admirer of Today and am delighted to have the opportunity to join the team.’ BBC director general Tony Hall said: ‘She is a first-rate journalist. She will be an excellent addition to what is a very powerful and strong team. He added: ‘I am particularly pleased that with her appointment there will be another female voice on the programme, which I think is really important.’ Miss Husain also worked on the BBC’s coverage of the 2012 Olympics and, reported for the corporation from Pakistan – the country where her parents were born – on the death of Osama Bin Laden and the assassination of the country’s ex-prime minister Benazir Bhutto. Scroll down for video .

Radio 5 Live’s morning slot also gained 162,000 extra weekly listeners, although Radio 3 saw a decline of 7,000. A BBC spokesperson said: 'Today has a very loyal audience and listening figures traditional hover around 7 million a week, but in this quarter across Radio 4 there has been a small dip in the weekly reach.'","Miss Husain joined the flagship news programme in October .

"Christine Bleakley with fiance Frank Lampard, both are set for move to New York . She already has two homes, one in London and another in Northern Ireland and now Christine Bleakley looks to be adding another. The TV presenter has revealed she has been hunting for a property in New York with her fiance Frank Lampard following the end of her four year ‘golden handshake’ deal with ITV. While Miss Bleakley, 35, still has several projects in the pipeline with the ITV, the end of her £4million deal frees her up to work for other broadcasters – even opening up the possibility of a job on American television. Miss Bleakley has been busy searching for a US base for Lampard, 36, ahead of his move next March. Lampard, the Premier League’s top scoring midfielder of all-time with 171 goals, has signed with New York City after seeing out his contract at Chelsea. He will join the American side when the season begins in March but will spend the next six months on loan to Manchester City. Speaking about the move the former Dancing on Ice presenter told The New York Post’s gossip section Page Six: ‘I’m easygoing. I’ll try to make this work for him [Lampard] but don’t want to live off him. 'Back home, I’m on Ireland’s channel and do ITV documentaries — a music special, an Ireland and Britain tour. Still doing that until his season starts. With all this to-ing-and-fro-ing, no idea what my career here will be.’ She told the American newspaper that she enjoys spending time in New York, adding: ‘I’m from Northern Ireland, living in London. I love it here. Love Bloomingdale’s. Love this walking city, although I don’t know always where I’m heading. And with firefighters, police, Belfast’s Madison Square Garden workers and friends who run a bar near Wall Street, I love the Irish connection. ‘[We are] stuck in a hotel now, we’re looking for an apartment. ‘I’ve been [to New York] before, but you need a feel for the place. Don’t want to get it wrong. People are helping but, basically, just Frank and I are looking. Ideal is a view. Four bedrooms. He has two little girls we want to look out for.’ Miss Bleakley made the move from the BBC to ITV in 2010, leaving her job presenting The One Show. However, her place at the broadcaster has changed numerous times as she has flitted between different shows. Her solo outing, Off The Beaten Track (pictured) was axed after a year, only managing to pull in 4million viewers . After being dropped from breakfast show Daybreak in 2011, the former Strictly Come Dancing contestant went on to front Dancing On Ice alongside Philip Schofield. However, the show came to an end earlier this year. Her solo outing, Off The Beaten Track was pegged as a competitor to BBC’s Countryfile but was axed after a year, only managing to pull in 4million viewers. Lampard has two daughters – Luna, eight, and Isla, seven – with his former fiancée, Spanish model Elen Rivas. The couple split in 2008 after seven years together, a year before he began dating Miss Bleakley, who he proposed to in 2011. A spokesman for Miss Bleakley said: ‘Christine will not be relocating to New York. She will remain based in London and will travel to and fro for the duration of Frank’s time [in New York].’ He pointed to the presenter’s ongoing commitments with ITV, including an upcoming six-part travelogue series and a stint on This Morning.","After four-year 'golden handshake' with ITV Miss Bleakley is set to move .

"Being a global superstar, it seems, is no guarantee people will know who you are. Rihanna might have sold more than 30million albums worldwide, but when her alleged stalker appeared in an American court, the judge found himself rather confused as to her identity. On being told that homeless Kevin McGlynn, 53, was ‘arrested for stalking Rihanna’, veteran New York judge Abraham Clott admitted he had no idea who she is. He simply asked: ‘Who?’ Scroll down for video . Rihanna might have sold more than 30million albums worldwide, but when her alleged stalker appeared in an American court, the judge found himself rather confused as to her identity . McGlynn appeared in court for the first time on Friday to face the two charges of stalking and one of harassment, but was in such an agitated state he was unable to enter a plea or be granted bail and has been kept in custody so a psychiatric evaluation can be carried out. McGlynn is accused of threatening the singer – real name Robyn Rihanna Fenty – in three notes dropped off at her rented $14.5million New York apartment on July 8 and 11. The letters repeatedly called the singer a ‘b****’ and said McGlynn would break-in to the property. He also allegedly sent at least four letters to her California home. In court, he accused Rihanna, 26, along with rappers Jay Z and Kanye West of stealing his ‘material’ and branded Judge Clott a ‘liar’ when told he could not defend himself. Rihanna was said to be scared for her safety after reading the letters that reportedly allude to a personal relationship that does not exist between the pop star and the homeless man.

"Revealing: Ola Jordan has lifted the lid on some of Strictly Come Dancing's secrets . To viewers it is a well-oiled production of glitz, glamour and dazzling sequins. But behind the scenes, Strictly Come Dancing is melting pot of high emotion, sexual tension – and lots of fake tan, according to one of its stars. Dancer Ola Jordan even admitted what many suspect – that relationships do develop between dancers and celebrities, but many are hushed up. Mrs Jordan, who is married to former Strictly professional James Jordan, 36, said: ‘It happens in the movies with actors and it happens on Strictly. ‘There have been relationships that have happened that have never come out in public, quite a bit. It happens as people get close. It is the bond you have with your partner.’ In 2009, boxer Joe Calzaghe split from girlfriend of five years Jo-Emma Larvin after being on the show. He went on to date dance partner Kristina Rihanoff for four years. Mrs Jordan also revealed how the male celebrities face increasing pressure to appear shirtless, while the women are urged into skimpy outfits. Last year, finalist and former Coronation Street star Natalie Gumede, 30, repeatedly had to ask designers to add extra inches to her dresses. Mrs Jordan said: ‘One day they are just going to give nipple tassels to come out with.’ Now aged 31, Mrs Jordan said she hated being filmed in high definition as she is conscious of being the oldest female dancer on the show and knows she could face the axe at any point as she has been performing on the show for so long. Speaking at a launch for beauty brand Proactiv, which she is the face of, the dancer was scathing about use of fake tan by her colleagues. She said: ‘Some of the girl dancers go crazy with tan. They have spray tans in the week and then on a show day they have more tan make-up on and they look dirty and streaky. Joe Calzaghe (pictured with his BBC Sports Personality of the Year award in 2009) split from girlfriend of five years Jo-Emma Larvin after being on the show . They go through a lot of tubs. It stains the clothes and goes everywhere. It is horrible. I hate it.’ But she added: ‘I am not going to say who are the worst culprits but they know who they are. They know who I am talking about. They are orange and they look as though they have been dipped in gravy.’ And Mrs Jordan remained diplomatic when discussing the atmosphere behind the scenes, saying: ‘You can’t get on with everyone. This is it. Strictly the show is quite stressful and hard but I have never cried. ‘It is not all glamour. What you see on a Saturday is the show and it is all perfect and we all look beautiful but behind the scenes there is a lot of hard work.’ Strictly returns in September, with Claudia Winkleman replacing Sir Bruce Forsyth as co-host. Mrs Jordan said: ‘I will miss Brucie as a person being there. I had a soft spot for him and he had a soft spot for me. ‘But I like Claudia. She is so quirky. She can’t dance but you don’t have to dance to present the show.’","Relationships do develop between dancers and celebrities, claims Ola Jordan .

"The Monty Python stars launched their farewell show yesterday – with a little help from some lingerie-clad dancers young enough to be their granddaughters. With the surviving Pythons now in their seventies, they have hired 20 dancers – ten male and ten female – to spice things up during their ten-date run at London’s O2, which begins tonight.

John Cleese, 74, Terry Gilliam, 73, Terry Jones, 72, and Eric Idle, 71, also star in the £4.5million show, which will feature appearances by Professors Stephen Hawking and Brian Cox. The Pythons also showed a spoof video of Sir Mick Jagger, 70, discussing the production with Rolling Stones bandmate Charlie Watts, 73, saying ironically: ‘It’s a bunch of wrinkly old men trying to make a load of money.’ The singer, who is seen watching the World Cup on TV, said they were just 'trying to relive their youth and make a load of money'. Back in time: Michael Palin as seen in the original 1970 Monty Python Blackmail sketch . Speaking to bandmate Charlie Watts, he adds: 'Who wants to see that again? It was funny in the 60s.' 'The best one died years ago. Maybe back in the 70s it was fantastic -- it was the funniest thing. We've seen it all before. I mean they've put it all up on YouTube.'

Monty Python’s Flying Circus was made for TV between 1969 and 1974 and generations of fans can recite lines and whole sketches. Sixth Python Graham Chapman died of cancer in 1989 aged just 48, and nine years later the five remaining members shared a stage at the Aspen Comedy Festival in the U.S. Cleese said the show, which includes a large cast of dancers and performers, set changes and special effects, costs around £4.5 million to stage.

Idle, who has done much of the planning for the shows, said the idea was 'to leave them wanting less'. The press conference, at London’s Palladium Theatre, began with a promotional clip for the concerts featuring Rolling Stones Mick Jagger and Charlie Watts discussing the concerts, with Jagger asking why the audience wanted to watch a 'bunch of wrinkly old men trying to relive their youth'. But Idle said fans wanted to see the classic sketches which made their name, saying: 'It would be odd to try and write better things than our best at this age'. Idle said he was not worried about jokes written decades ago being appreciated by a modern audience because they had not dated. He said: 'It's mainly timeless actually because we were very fortunate and followed the satire movement in England and everything was topical so when we came along we tried to knock that.' It was announced another 600 tickets would go on sale today.","Stars launch ten-date O2 run with the help of lingerie-clad dancers .

"She is not impressed by the unrealistic female characters in many Hollywood films but that hasn’t stopped Keira Knightley earning a fortune by playing them. At least the irony is not lost on the English actress, 29, who branded herself a ‘complete hypocrite’ for demanding better role models for women while also posing for fashion magazines often criticised for providing the opposite. The Oscar-nominee – who has appeared on the cover of titles including Vogue, Harper’s Bazaar and Elle – accepted her double standards in an interview with a Sunday newspaper. Scroll down for video . 'Hypocrite': Keira Knightley prefers working on a women-led production because 'then you don¿t have to do this loveable, soft version of what the female sex has to be' She told The Sunday Times she thinks many women feel no affinity with the majority of female characters, saying: ‘My friend was saying she loved 1970s movies, and we both realised that’s because we see ourselves as the main guys in them. ‘When I watched The Godfather, I was Al Pacino I wasn’t his f****** wife. It’s interesting that there’s still this funny construction of femininity’. She had made this comments despite the fact she found fame through hits such as The Pirates of the Caribbean series, King Arthur and this year’s Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit, which arguably contain the very roles she is criticising. Knightley, who is married to James Righton, 30, of band The Klaxons, said the problem stems from the low number of female directors working in mainstream films. Mr & Mrs James Righton: Knightley and her rock star husband James Righton of the band The Klaxons . However, she also admitted that the predominance of male roles in films comes from the fact that ‘women will go and see a male lead, but it’s difficult to get a guy to see a film that is seen as girly’. She added that it is a problem that often concerns her, saying: ‘I think when you recognise it’s strange that half the population doesn’t have the same voice as the other half, and there’s minorities within minorities that don’t have a voice and should have it, it does make you go, “Ha. This is interesting”’. She said she prefers working on a women-led production because, ‘then you don’t have to do this loveable, soft version of what the female sex has to be. It also allows men to understand women, as opposed to them being something pink and fluffy’. However, pushed on what she would do to fix the problem, she admitted she didn’t know where to begin. She said: ‘No idea. I wish I knew. Keep on having conversations and somebody intelligent will go, “Eureka”’. The actress – who earned £1.5million last year but claimed to live on only £30,000 – has been working her way up the Hollywood A-list since first coming to public attention in 2002’s Bend It Like Beckham. She has gone on to win top modelling contracts – she has worked with Chanel since 2008 – and appear in blockbusters such as this year’s Jack Ryan film, believed to be the first of a franchise and based on the best-selling novels. However, she said in the candid interview that she is so disenchanted with the type of film it represents that she couldn’t manage to sit through even half of the movie, which grossed £80million worldwide.","Oscar-nominee has appeared on cover of Vogue, Harper’s Bazaar and Elle .

"Robin Williams was last seen alive by his wife Susan Schneider at around 10.30pm on Sunday, when she went to her room at their home in California, officials said . Alone and depressed, Robin Williams spent his final hours in a separate bedroom from his wife, it was revealed last night. His body lay undiscovered for 12 hours after his suicide. The actor was last seen alive by his wife Susan Schneider at around 10.30pm on Sunday, when she went to her room, officials said. They are believed to have been the only people in the house. Miss Schneider left the mansion in Tiburon, north of San Francisco, at around 10.30am on Monday, thinking her husband was still asleep. Williams was found by his personal assistant at around 11.45am after he failed to respond to knocks on his door. Miss Schneider learned of his death only after emergency services, called by the assistant, pronounced the 63-year-old dead at 12.02pm. She issued a touching tribute to her husband in a statement that said: ‘I lost my husband and my best friend, while the world lost one of its most beloved artists and beautiful human beings. ‘I am utterly heartbroken. On behalf of Robin’s family, we are asking for privacy during our time of profound grief. As he is remembered, it is our hope the focus will not be on Robin’s death, but on the countless moments of joy and laughter he gave to millions.’ Revealing the results of a preliminary investigation, assistant chief deputy coroner Lieutenant Keith Boyd, from Marin County Sheriff’s Office, said the actor appeared to have died from asphyxia due to hanging. ‘It is unknown when Mr Williams retired for the evening in a bedroom at his home,’ said Mr Boyd, adding that initial tests showed the star had been dead for at least 12 hours. The body did not appear to have been moved after death and there were no signs of a struggle. Mr Boyd said toxicology tests will be conducted to find out if Williams had any drugs or alcohol in his system when he died. He confirmed that Williams had been seeking treatment for depression, but would not discuss whether he left a suicide note. He emphasised that the investigation was still active and that an official cause of death would not be announced for several weeks. The body has been released for the family to make funeral arrangements. Miss Schneider left the mansion in Tiburon, north of San Francisco, at around 10.30am on Monday, thinking her husband was still asleep .

Asked whether Williams and his wife were sleeping in separate bedrooms, Mr Boyd said: ‘We’re not going into that part of the investigation. What I will say is that she retired to bed. Mr Williams’ wife retired prior to Mr Williams into a room in the home. It is not known at this time exactly when Mr Williams retired for the evening, but he went to a different room of the home.’ The actor’s two ex-wives have yet to speak about his death. His first marriage, to Valerie Velardi, collapsed in 1988 after he had an affair with cocktail waitress Michelle Tish Carter. Miss Carter sued him in 1986, claiming he did not tell her he was infected with the herpes virus, which he transmitted to her. The case was settled out of court. In 1989 he married his son’s nanny, Marsha Garces, who was already pregnant. They split in March 2008. Williams was open about the effect his alcohol addiction had on his family relationships, and blamed his drinking for the break-up of his 19-year second marriage. Although Williams spoke candidly about his drink and drugs problems in interviews, longtime friends said he always concealed his inner self . ‘You know, I was shameful, and you do stuff that causes disgust, and that’s hard to recover from,’ he said. The comic used to be a binge-drinking cocaine addict early in his career, but quit after his friend John Belushi died from a heroin and cocaine overdose in 1982. He remained sober for 20 years but started drinking again in 2003, leading to long stints in rehab. Explaining his addiction to alcohol he once said: ‘It’s just literally being afraid. And you think, oh, this will ease the fear. And it doesn’t... It’s just a general all-round arggghhh! It’s fearfulness and anxiety.’Williams said a string of serious health problems and open heart surgery in 2009 helped him feel ‘mortal’ for the first time and turn his life around. But he continued to struggle with depression and last month checked into a Minnesota rehab facility for help maintaining sobriety after a gruelling year and a half of work. Although he spoke candidly about his drink and drugs problems in interviews, longtime friends said he always concealed his inner self.

"Can turning 70 be a milestone to treasure? In a poll, one in three septuagenarians said they were ‘very happy’ with their lives, but only one in six of those in their 50s and 60s did. So is life more fun at 70? We asked three personalities. I’m happy to be the butt of a joke . 'I'M HAPPY TO BE THE BUTT OF A JOKE' Sandra Howard, 73, is married to former Home Secretary Michael Howard and says she has never stopped trying to look her best . We have a well-worn saying in the family: ‘Doing a granny.’ My mother used to half-absorb some comment or observation and come out with it a few minutes later as a shiny new nugget of her own. Or she’d pose a strange question such as: ‘Who was it who said “I’m a celebrity, get me out of here?”’ Something of that kind, and we’d fall about with laughter at her getting the wrong end of the stick. I’m the one ‘doing a granny’ now. I’m never quite up on the latest pop star and usually mix them up with a cricketer or boxer, rather enjoying the fact that I end up being the butt of the joke. But hitting my 70s hasn’t been anything like as bad as when I turned 50 or 60. Those significant birthdays were terribly depressing because there’s so much hype and expectation about reaching them. This decade, on the other hand, is without doubt the best. We septuagenarians are keen to make the most of things while our health and marbles last, and that gives us a different kind of zest for life, one with more urgency. And there’s a long list of pluses. We still worry about the children, of course — even if, in my case, you have one in their 50s — but the panic and guilt that used to consume us isn’t there any more. I no longer worry endlessly as I did when our children Nicholas and Larissa were teenagers. I feared they might plummet down a cliff in their first cars or give in to every temptation crossing their path. And the anxiety about parties! Once the children had one while we were away and set off the house alarms — it was when my husband Michael was Home Secretary. The police came to see what was going on, but I managed to keep it secret from him. He would have been livid if he’d found out. As for my appearance, I never stop trying to look my best — and splash out on any miracle cream going. But the pressure is off. I can’t say I don’t feel jealous when some sleek, supple 30 or 40-year-old walks into the room — what I’d give for that glowing skin, the mane of hair, those toned, shapely legs. But what the hell, I’m having a great time. My age feels irrelevant half the time. Plus, being in our 70s and with politics no longer the master of our time, Michael and I see more of friends, too — our desire to stay in touch is stronger than ever. Best of all is feeling I can stop trying so hard. Nothing is such a burning, all-consuming issue any more. I can be eccentric, have forceful opinions and wear funky clothes, such as my emerald green skinny jeans. I have the joy of grand- children. I love the way they and their parents humour me, and their mirth when I mix up their names. I’m pampered and properly indulged. So, to be perfectly honest, I wouldn’t really turn the clock back — even if I could. feeling healthy is a gift every day . 'FEELING HEALTHY IS A GIFT EVERY DAY' Penny Vincenzi says she feels free to do what she likes now she's in her 70s despite having more family responsibilities . Well, let’s start with the good news. Because there is a lot of that. If I started with the bad — and there’s quite a bit — you might not read on. First, in my eighth decade (golly!) I feel wonderfully free. Free to do what I like: free to say yes, I’d love to come out for dinner, go on holiday, go to the theatre, get involved in a local project, without a thought. Do things my way, go where I wish. Of course, in my 70s I have responsibilities, not least to my family, which I do my best to meet. I have four daughters and eight grandchildren, whom I adore and see a lot of. These are busy, happy, lovely times. Yet raising children isn’t my prime task any more. Now, as a grandmother, I appreciate the oft cited benefit of being able to hand them back. There are other responsibilities, too. I always seem to have a book to finish writing, but then I count that as one of the good things in life. I consider myself incredibly lucky still to be working, producing something someone else wants. It’s gorgeous to have work to do that I enjoy so much. It accounts for a lot of my happiness. Also, I can spoil myself — almost — without guilt. I buy nice clothes, get my hair coloured and my nails done — a new extravagance! And I have more time for myself, which is an incredible pleasure. But there is a downside. Grief, loneliness and shock set in after Paul, my husband of 50 years, died at the beginning of my 70s. It seemed to go on for ever, day after dark, empty day, however busy I managed to be. And you never get over it. But you do get used to it because you have to. As a very dear friend said, you mustn’t be seen to be endlessly miserable. Otherwise, no one, especially the young, will want to be with you. The number of people in the world aged 60 and . older has doubled since 1980 and is forecast . to reach two billion by 2050 . And like all of us, you don’t want to be a burden. So you fake it, as best you can. And I have emerged much stronger, which is how I deal with the occasional lonely Sunday (easily the worst day of the week to be by yourself). In my early 70s, I was ill with a rare blood disorder. It took several weeks in hospital to get over. But, in a strange way, it was almost worth it. Feeling well again is a wonderful thing; it’s like being given a present every day. So, the happiest decade? No, but it can still be very happy indeed. My father-in-law once said to me: ‘Penny, old age is hell.’ Well, it can be. But as I said at my most recent birthday party, it can be heaven, too. no more fretting about tomorrow . 'NO MORE FRETTING ABOUT TOMORROW' Gloria Hunniford says she preferred her 50s and has suddenly become more aware of her own mortality . I barely batted an eyelid when I turned 50 and then 60 — they were milestones I didn’t give too much thought about. But when my 70th birthday loomed, I admit I wasn’t looking forward to it at all. The phrase my mother and grandmother used to describe the accepted time most of us are meant to live, three score years and ten, kept running through my head. Times have changed, though, and I feel very lucky to have reached this age, happy and in good health — as so many older people are. But something about the number 70 still felt unnerving. I certainly don’t feel I’m in my 70s. Right now, I’m in the best shape I’ve ever been because I’ve switched to a sugar-free, low-carb diet after finding out I had high blood sugar. But if I could wave a magic wand and go back to my 50s, I’d do it in a heartbeat. Who wouldn’t take the chance to be younger again, with more of their life still ahead of them? At this stage, I’m no longer planning for the next few decades. Rather, I’m following my father’s mantra and living one day at a time, something I’ve always been rather good at. Suddenly, I’ve become much more aware of my own mortality. When you start to lose friends and colleagues, as I have, it’s a stark reminder you won’t be here for ever. That is why it’s so important not to lose your lust for life. I know that, for most people, hitting 70 marks the moment when they can look back on a life of hard work, put their feet up and relax. But not me. I don’t want to slip into old age. I’m the kind of person who thrives on being busy and active — and the idea of losing that energy fills me with dread. However, there are wonderful advantages to being this age. I no longer work every day and I cherish the freedom that gives me more time with loved ones. I’m happily married for the second time, too, and my husband Stephen and I have ten grandchildren between us. Nothing brings us more joy than being so closely involved in their lives. But this week I’ve started a new job as a panellist on Loose Women, and will be a contributor on a brand new BBC series, Home Away From Home. I think that speaks volumes about my attitude. So, I won’t be booking my ticket on a six-month cruise with all the other retired 70-somethings just yet — not while there is still so much more yet to be done.","One in three septuagenarians said they were ‘very happy’ with their lives .

"The woman whose unthinkable loss of her two children was one of the most tragic stories to come from Superstorm Sandy has spoken out about one year after her ordeal. Glenda Moore, 40, was a Staten Island mother of two before the relentless storm surge took away her boys Connor, 4, and Brandon, 2. Now she's trying to pick up the pieces amid the painful memories stirred by the anniversary of the hurricane. Scroll down for video... Staying strong: A year after the storm, a woman whose 2 and 4-year-old sons were killed by Hurricane Sandy has spoken out about her ordeal . Tragic: 2-year-old Brandon and 4-year-old Connor Moore, were sucked into the swirling floodwaters as their mother, Glenda Moore, tried to escape her SUV . Moore's nightmare began a year ago when she was driven from her home in the hard hit New York City borough of Staten Island. As her Ford Explorer stalled on the Father Capodanno Boulevard in South Beach, she got out of the vehicle and freed both boys from their seat belts. She grabbed them and put one under each arm - but lost her grip as a huge wave pounded over their heads. 'It's been a tough week, it's been a year since we lost the boys,' Moore told WABC in an exclusive interview Monday. Destroyed: This is Moore's smashed SUV, which she drove from her house as the storm worsened, then was forced to try to escape . Sad day: On Saturday, it will be a year since Moore's boys were buried. Here, at their November 9 funeral, watches as New York sanitation department workers carry one of their caskets . The search continued for days, with numerous emergency personnel joining the march through Staten Island marshland. The bodies were found about 100 feet from each other at the end of a narrow dead end street. 'Every minute, pretty much all we do is think about them,' Moore said Monday. She . and her husband have moved to Brooklyn to be near family in the year . since the storm and she and husband Damian are looking for a new home in . the Marine Park area and want to start a new family. Better days: Glenda Moore (center) with her husband Damien on their wedding day in 2009 . Distraught: New York sanitation commissioner John Doherty consoles Moore and her husband Damian. The couple now says they want to start a family again . But in the meantime, she said: 'I couldn’t spend another night at that house.' After . the boys disappeared, police said, Moore fled and in a panic climbed . fences and went door-to-door looking in vain for help in a neighborhood . that was presumably largely abandoned in the face of the storm. While their home remains painfully quiet for now, Moore, who is a nurse, said work has been what's kept her positive. 'At least we're busy during the day,' she said. Moore tries to stay upbeat but says its still very hard. 'Every minute, pretty much all we do is think about them,' she said .","Glenda Moore lost both her children in the 2012 storm after being forced from her home and then her car during the storm .

"Are Manchester United right to sack David Moyes? One thing Louis van Gaal would be able to guarantee, should he indeed now become Manchester United’s next manager, is a good relationship with the finest footballer at Old Trafford. David Moyes would insist that he too has enjoyed a healthy rapport with Robin van Persie. He could even point to that recent interview Van Persie gave in which he declared his support for Sir Alex Ferguson’s successor. But the rumours have persisted, the fact of the matter being that Van Persie felt let down by Ferguson for retiring only a year after convincing him to move from Arsenal to Old Trafford. Moyes just wasn’t Fergie and so the problems apparently began. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch David Moyes and Louis van Gaal speak .

Van Gaal and the Manchester United striker have built a special relationship together . Dutch courage: Van Gaal recently made Van Persie captain of the Holland international team . Whatever the truth about that . particular situation, the relationship between Van Gaal and Van Persie . seems to be built on more solid foundations. It . has developed from Van Gaal’s decision to appoint the United striker as . captain of the Dutch national team and has grown into something fairly . rare in the sphere of modern football. Imagine . Roy Hodgson inviting Steven Gerrard to join him on a scouting mission. Well, that is what Van Gaal has asked Van Persie to do in recent weeks, . having him attend matches between Vitesse Arnhem and Ajax, and PSV . Eindhoven and Feyenoord. Van . Gaal has taken advantage of the fact that Van Persie has been using the . medical services of the Dutch FA in Zeist to recover from injury. But . even so, it points to a special bond between the two men. Scot to trot: David Moyes failed to live up to expectations as Manchester United manager . In . the past Van Gaal has not always enjoyed such a relationship with his . senior players. For instance, during his first spell at Barcelona he . clashed with both Rivaldo and Luis Figo. Even . with Van Persie there was a shaky start. Before his first game as . Holland manager, Van Gaal asked the players to explain their roles in . the debacle that was their Euro 2012 campaign. When Van Persie chose to . remain comparatively silent on the issue, Van Gaal opted to leave him . out of that opening encounter with Belgium, preferring Klaas-Jan . Huntelaar up front.

But over time he grew to like and admire Van Persie and within a year had made him his skipper ahead of Wesley Sneijder. As . things stand today, United have nothing signed with Van Gaal. On Monday the Dutchman was said to be off to Portugal for a holiday, having . already asked Tottenham for more time to consider an offer he is . understood to have received. It is, say sources in Holland, one of three . offers on the table, with the other believed to be United and the third . a club in mainland Europe. United, . say those same sources, would be his preference. He has long had an . ambition to work in England and was quite at home with the idea of . becoming United manager when he was named among the favourites to . succeed Ferguson back in 2002. Then, of course, Ferguson changed his . mind about retiring. Man hug: Van Persie decided to leave Arsenal for Old Trafford for the chance to work with Sir Alex Ferguson . Grudge match? Rumours persisted all season that Van Persie and Moyes didn't see eye to eye . Second season syndrome? Van Persie has been a shadow of his former self for United this term . Van . Gaal delivered a speech at The Savoy in January at the Football Writers’ Association tribute dinner for Jose Mourinho. He was said to have seen . this as a chance to impress the English media. And . he was impressive, in both his eloquence — when English, of course, is . not his first language — and his success in striking the right balance . for the audience. Van Gaal has won 19 trophies in 23 years of management. He has won the league at every club he has managed. While he . displayed enough humility to suggest that Mourinho has surpassed his own . achievements to become the outstanding manager in Europe, we were left . in little doubt here was the Dutch master to Mourinho’s apprentice. He . told the story of how Mourinho became his assistant at Barcelona. At . their first meeting in a restaurant in the Catalan capital, he was . struck by this young, relatively diminutive Portuguese who dared . remonstrate with the club president for his treatment of the outgoing . Sir Bobby Robson, despite the presence of the new manager. Impressed by Mourinho’s loyalty, not to mention his courage, he concluded immediately this guy would be perfect alongside him. Most wanted: Van Gaal has several offers, including Tottenham, after he takes Holland to the World Cup . SOS: United are desperate to return to winning ways after their worst season in Premier League history . The . story he told at The Savoy was followed by an acknowledgement of the . manager Mourinho  has now become. ‘I am always the “arrogant Louis van . Gaal” but now I am humble,’ he said. ‘Now, he is better than me.’ But . United are sure to draw confidence from the confidence Van Gaal . clearly has in himself. He is arrogant, and such arrogance will be . required to occupy a role that has proved so uncomfortable for Moyes. He . would have the benefit of being the man who follows the man who . followed Ferguson. But after almost 30 years in coaching, the . 62-year-old Van Gaal has his own way of doing things, and United could . find him a little too uncompromising. He likes to run a club from top to . bottom. ‘From the first team to the laundry,’ said one Dutch observer on Monday. ‘Even the board.’ Star pupil: The Dutchman helped school Jose Mourinho (L) in the art of management . Forward thinking: The Dutchman started the revolution that led to Bayern becoming the world's best . Van Gaal lifts the 2010 Bundesliga trophy - the last of 18 major honours he has won . That . said, his methods have delivered great success. He is credited with . starting the revolution that has seen Bayern Munich become the best team . in Europe, despite the fact he was eventually dismissed in April 2011.

"A young father who lost three limbs when a common cold developed into a flesh-eating bug is finally back home with his family after months in hospital. Alex Lewis is adapting to life back at home in Hampshire, learning to get about in his wheelchair after  a bacterial infection claimed both his legs and left arm. The 34-year-old battled against the odds to make a remarkable recovery after doctors gave him a three per cent chance of survival. His ordeal began last November when the former pub landlord feared he had caught a common cold. Instead, tests revealed Mr Lewis had contracted Group A streptococcus. Scroll down for video . Alex Lewis (pictured with his partner, Lucy, and son, Sam) will have his last remaining limb, his right arm, amputated after losing both legs and his left arm to a flesh-eating bug . The normally harmless bacteria is usually filtered out by the body but in the father-of-one's case, it developed into septicaemia and toxic shock syndrome. Mr Lewis's major organs shut down and he spent a week in a coma as the deadly bacteria wreaked havoc through his body. Doctors had to amputate both his legs above the knee and his left arm after his feet, fingertips, arms, lips, nose and part of his ears turned black. He also lost part of his nose, his lips and underwent a pioneering 16-hour operation to reconstruct his remaining arm in a bid to save it. Medics told his partner Lucy Townsend - who runs The Greyhound pub in Stockbridge, Hampshire - he wouldn’t make it. But just six months later, the 34-year-old is back home and playing with his three-year-old son Sam. Despite . his ordeal, Mr Lewis says he could not be happier as he has now moved . into an adapted home with his family and beloved Labrador Holly. Mr Lewis, from Stockbridge, said: ‘I feel desperately positive. I feel much stronger and every day is getting easier. ‘I can’t put into words how happy I am to be at home with my family and see my little boy - I’ve missed it all so much. ‘The first thing Sam was itching to do was to get me into his bedroom so I could see all his toys. It was lovely. Mr Lewis (pictured with his partner and son before his illness) thought he had developed a cold in November but he had actually contracted strep A which wreaked havoc throughout his body and left him close to death . Mr Lewis (pictured in hospital) was give just a three per cent chance of survival when he was in hospital . Group A streptococci is a bacteria commonly found in the throat and on the skin. The vast majority of infections are relatively mild illnesses, such as strep throat and impetigo. Occasionally, however, the bacteria can become life-threatening if it enters parts of the body where it is not usually found - such as the blood, muscles or the lungs. The bacteria is often spread through direct contact with the mucus of an infected person and through contact with infected skin wounds and sores. Invasive group A streptococcal disease, which may occur when the bacteria gets past the body’s defences, is a severe and sometimes life-threatening infection in which the bacteria has invaded parts of the body, such as the blood, deep muscle and fat tissue or the lungs. Two of the most severe forms of invasive group A streptococcal disease are called necrotising fasciitis (infection of muscle and fat tissue) and toxic shock syndrome (a rapidly progressing infection causing injury to the major organs). The early signs and symptoms of necrotising fasciitis include fever, severe pain and swelling, and redness at the wound site. The early symptoms of toxic shock syndrome may include fever, dizziness, confusion, low blood pressure, rash and abdominal pain. ‘Our whole life has been turned upside down but for me, there’s a lot of clarity. ‘I feel I’ve experienced life and death and I am just so lucky to be here.’ With support from members of the public, the family home now has everything Mr Lewis needs to be able to get his independence back. And although he has no feeling in his right hand, doctors say the nerve growth is impressive. The weight of his first prosthetic arm painfully rubs his shoulder with each movement but he is slowly learning to use the metal hook as a hand. Next week, his new wheelchair will arrive and he hopes to wheel himself on to the ward at Salisbury District Hospital, Wiltshire, in July to have his lips reconstructed. The golf fanatic is also determined to take his first steps by the end of the summer. But for now, completing basic tasks like getting into bed, climbing on and off the sofa and using the bathroom are major tests of physical and mental strength. Days after returning home Mr Lewis broke his arm trying to push himself up and also fell backwards out of his chair and hit his head on the kitchen floor. He said: ‘On top of everything else, I went and broke my arm. ‘I just rolled over one day and tried to push myself up on my stump and heard a snap. ‘The thing is, if you are tired and weak one day, you’ve still got to do it. Mr Lewis is set to have surgery to rebuild his lips in the next six weeks, to allow him to eat and speak normally . Mr Lewis hopes he will soon learn to  walk on prosthetic legs . ‘You have to eat and use the bathroom. Just getting around the house is a real effort. 'When I whacked my head, my best mate was out in the garden and I shouted for him but he didn’t hear me. ‘All I could do was lie there on my back for a bit like an upturned tortoise. ‘Luckily . my new wheelchair has anti tippers to stop that from happening but . that’s all part of it, it will happen loads of times. ‘You . have to get yourself up and get back on with it - but using a . prosthetic arm I’m not used to and an arm that’s broken isn’t . straightforward. 'I feel I have experienced life and death and I am just so lucky to be here' - Alex Lewis . ‘You have to take the rough with the smooth. Ultimately if I was in this position in two years’ time I’d be heartbroken. ‘But I will walk again and I will use my arm again.’ Since coming home, Mr Lewis’s best friend Chris Bagley has become his full time carer. The pair, best friends since they were 14, constantly come up with creative ways to make life easier. For . instance, Mr Bagley has helped him adapt a fork for his prosthetic arm . and built a shelf so Mr Lewis can dispense his own shampoo. However, not being able to fit anything bigger than a French fry in his mouth is one thing that gets to Mr Lewis. But . after lip surgery next month, he will go to a specialist unit in .

"From diseased horses to displaced cattle and family dramas, The Archers has kept listeners captivated for more than six decades with its authentic storylines. But, while its ‘everyday story of country folk’ in Ambridge is pure fiction, it seems it paints a better picture of rural life than BBC News. Radio 4’s flagship drama has been singled out as one of the ‘gems’ of the BBC’s rural coverage in an independent review published by the BBC Trust. A report has found that The Archers paints a better picture of rural life than BBC News. Pictured is the Church of St Mary the Virgin in Hanbury, Worcestershire. It's bells can be heard in the long-running radio serial . The long-running soap is credited with setting ‘a rural pulse twice a day, six days a week on BBC Radio 4’ and playing ‘an important role in reflecting rural events that might be “too slow growing” for mainstream news programmes’. This is in contrast to wider BBC coverage of rural affairs, which the report labelled ‘squeamish’ and ‘simplistic’, highlighting a lack of reporters with in-depth knowledge of rural issues as a key concern. The BBC as a whole, while commended for being ‘generally impartial’, was criticised for often painting rural communities as one of two extremes – either a rose tinted-idyll or area of stark deprivation. Country Life editor Mark Hedges said there is a ‘squeamishness’ about portraying the grittiness of rural life and that this approach did ‘the countryside a real disservice’. Key problems identified by the report were the lack of coverage of rural issues in national news, the narrow range of voices and opinions heard in reports, a ‘metropolitan bias’ in what stories are covered and an over-simplification of complex rural issues. BBC News was also accused of having an ‘unintended bias’ when reporting on controversial issues, particularly on the furore surrounding badger culls. Countryfile is also seen as a key component of the BBC's efforts to reflect rural issues. Pictured left to right are Matt Baker, Ellie Harrison, Adam Henson, Tom Heap and John Craven from the show . One of the problems identified was the use of images of ‘cute’ and healthy badgers in reports, rather than ones infected with TB, which critics say pushed the audience towards a sympathetic view of the animals. Julia Marley, a committee member for the Campaign to Protect Rural England, told the review: ‘Badgers – the first thing you see are cute badgers. The argument has already gone. Immediately the impression is formed.’ The Archers was explicitly excluded from the report’s remit because it is not a factual or current affairs programme. However, Heather Hancock, the review’s author and former senior partner at consulting firm Deloitte, felt the show was so integral to the BBC’s rural offering the she could not complete her work without addressing it. She said: ‘It proved impossible to ask any audience or stakeholder about the BBC’s rural affairs coverage without discussing the significance of The Archers’. She identified it, along with BBC One’s Countryfile and Radio Four’s Farming Today, as a key component of the BBC’s efforts to reflect rural issues and found that its audience ‘hold it to be a fair and accurate reflection of farming and rural affairs’. ‘It proved impossible to ask any . audience or stakeholder about the BBC’s rural affairs coverage without . discussing the significance of The Archers’ - Heather Hancock . Stretching back more than 17,000 episodes, it was started by BBC Midlands in 1950 with the aim of entertaining farmers and educating them on how to feed a country still subject to post-war rationing. It now commands around 5 million listeners a week as it chronicles the bustling farming community. While it has occasionally courted controversy, dropping 400,000 listeners in 2012, with listeners complaining the show was being ‘sexed up’ and was becoming unrealistic with storylines involving rape, abortion and arson attacks, it has always stayed true to its rural roots. Alongside the family dramas and human relationships, recent episodes have seen an outbreak of strangles – a respiratory infection that effects horses – at the local stables, a pig farm being threatened with losing its organic status over infringements of feeding guidelines and a herd of cattle being displaced by floods. It is known for the meticulous research it put into storylines and has archivists to ensure it remains consistent in its approach, both to characters and the land they live on, over the decades. A spokesman for BBC News said: ‘We take our commitment to the reporting of rural affairs very seriously and welcome the report’s endorsement of our programming and overall impartiality. 'Whilst the report finds overall we do a good job reflecting and reporting rural affairs there are areas where we can do better and we have committed to a range of steps to help improve the coverage further.’","The Archers credited with setting 'a rural pulse's throughout the week .

"One hundred years ago today, Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated... setting off a chain of events that led to the First World War. But did you know that the Austrian aristocrat didn’t see the pistol of his assassin because he was ‘too busy guzzling his tenth Wiener schnitzel’? And that gunman Gavrilo Princip, a member of Serbian terror group the Black Hand, had ‘popped a cap in his a** for my Black Hand brothers’? Dumbing down: Assassin Gavrilo Princip, a member of Serbian terror group the Black Hand, in the video . Well, that’s according to the BBC – which commissioned a five-minute video in which the key figures behind the outbreak of the Great War play out the complex tangle of events in the form of a ‘rap battle’ – complete with hip-hop style swearing, sexual innuendo and national stereotyping. Yesterday experts branded the clip – made as part of the corporation’s efforts to mark the war’s centenary – as a factually inaccurate, juvenile and desperate attempt to court popularity with a streetwise audience. The video – made by production company Ballista – has actors play the roles of characters including King George V, Tsar Nicholas II of Russia and Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany. They make jokes about sex, Queen Victoria, refer to anachronistic characters like Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson and describe the French as having a ‘snail-sucking, frog-cooking, garlic stench’. Rap lyrics by the main characters include: . Emperor Franz Josef (Franz Ferdinand’s uncle): Russians, Mongols, Turks, my b******, best watch out ‘cos my trigger finger itches. You’re tiresome, you’re irksome, like a Slavic Jeremy Clarkson. Kaiser Wilhelm II (Germany): Empire braggarts, you hate the French and their snail-sucking, frog-cooking, garlic stench. (Camera pans over to General Joffre standing in the corner). As for your dreadnoughts, wave them goodbye I’ll make your navy into gravy for my sauerkraut pie. Kaiser Wilhelm II: Look into my eyes, you see compromise? Your collective demise will see our rise. I can’t back down now, I’ll look a clown now. Ain’t **** that can stop this countdown now. I’m going for a lie down now. Chris McGovern, of the Campaign for Real Education, said: ‘It’s a desperate, frantic and hopeless attempt to engage children, they have given up on every sensible method so they resort to rap music. 'It’s just another example of the complete dumbing down of what history should be about. They would argue they are making it accessible to young people but it’s actually very patronising in that sense because it fails to challenge them. ‘It’s a desperate attempt to appeal to the street, to children they have already lost, basically this is an indication they have given up on any proper teaching.’ The video, which has been watched more than 21,000 times since it was uploaded on YouTube on Tuesday, was written by comedian Lee Henman. He has admitted that when he was commissioned for the project he knew ‘b***** all about World War I, except what I’d gleaned from Blackadder Goes Forth’. Oxford historian Professor Sir Hew Strachan said: ‘I do not think this is a sensible way to engage people and it runs the risk of further distorting history in the process. Gavrilo Princip also seems to be a Serbian rather than a Bosnian.’ Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said licence fee payers would be angry at the use of cash for ‘lazy national stereotypes and off-colour gags’. Ballista did not respond to requests for a comment. A spokesman for the BBC said: ‘Clear . warnings are given about the content at the start of this video which . introduces younger audiences - in a humorous and accessible way - to the . complicated political alliances that led to the outbreak of WW1. ‘We are marking the WW1 centenary with our most ambitious pan-BBC season . of programming to date and this WW1 Uncut film sits alongside over 2,500 hours . of landmark documentary series, commemoration, drama, debate, music, arts, UK-wide . events and online activity.’","Clip has actors playing George V, Tsar Nicholas II and Kaiser Wilhelm II .

"The pace of change along central Vietnam’s coastline is dizzying. As we drive along the beach road between the Unesco World Heritage sites of Hoi An and Hué, rows of luxury holiday resorts are being built on any spare piece of land overlooking the white beaches. ‘Five years ago there was nothing here – this road we’re driving on wasn’t even built,’ our guide Trong tells us. ‘Local fisherman used to live in huts along here. Now this area is turning into Vietnam’s new playground.’ Just beautiful: The Lang Co peninsula is one of the Vietnamese sites where new resorts have appeared . It is hard to tell from the tone of Trong’s voice whether he welcomes the construction boom because of the jobs that are being created – or whether he is alarmed at the upheaval. While the arrival of mass tourism is certainly altering the landscape in central Vietnam, things have a long way to go before they reach the scale seen in large swathes of Thailand over the past 20 years. And although the big-name brands have arrived, alongside manicured golf courses designed by Nick Faldo, Greg Norman and Colin Montgomerie – it also, we soon discover, takes only a five-minute cycle ride to reach traditional villages where virtually no English is spoken, and the main occupation remains rice growing in the paddy fields. Among the new resorts is a Banyan Tree – which, along with its sister hotel Angsana next door, is situated beneath the Truong Son mountain range. A place of history: Hué was the capital of Vietnam's Nguyen dynasty, and wears its heritage in bright colours . This is currently the only resort on a crescent-shaped bay near Lang Co, a remote area of fishing villages and jungle, midway down the central coast. There are plans to add another six hotels and a casino to the area, but when we arrive there is little other evidence of new development. As we approach the resort, we can see emerald-green paddy fields spreading out for miles, flecked by conical bamboo hats shielding farmers from the midday sun. We see very little of the resort until we were right upon it. It has been nestled into the shadows of the mountains, keeping it from dominating the skyline. It is a resort of villas, its sloped pagoda-style roofs modelled on the traditional houses of the old imperial city of Hué, with plunge pools and infinity pools slotted in. During our visit, we suffer several days of unusually cold and wet weather, so our trips to the beach are limited. Fortunately, there are plenty of non-beach related activities with which to fill our time. A stretch of sand to soothe the soul: Lang Co is one of the Far East's most idyllic spots . We opt to take the hotel bikes to the centre of Lang Co, some 13 miles away. Our plans bemuse the hotel staff, who say guests tend to use them to get around the resort, rather than for any longer excursions. Within a couple of minutes we realise why. Those imposing granite mountains prove something of a challenge for our one-gear bikes to get over. But after a lot of panting and inevitable pushing, we find ourselves cycling through quaint hamlets where homes have small grocery shops spilling out of their front drives. Some front rooms and gardens have been converted into noodle stalls, with plastic chairs and tables neatly set with chopstick holders and small plates of thick-cut limes, fresh chilli and garlic. As we cycle past, a growing gathering of Vietnamese children run – or in some cases cycle – after us with big grins on their faces. Over and over again they shout: ‘Hello, how are you?’ Shadows fall: The Truong Son mountains rear up above the central coast of Vietnam . We are hoping to buy wine in Lang Co, somewhat afraid of the mini-bar prices. But all we can find are cans of beer or bottles of the local firewater ruou – a sticky distilled-rice liquor. Declining the chance to sample this home-brew at leisure, we come upon two floating restaurants on a nearby lake. This proves to be a thoroughly authentic experience – the seafood in our noodle dishes sourced from two attached fish farms. At 50p a head, our meal is certainly value for money. Back at our hotel, we were glad of some luxury after our long ride. We both opt for a Thai Classic massage, and the aches fade away. The resort is located at the axis of three Unesco World Heritage sites in Vietnam's ‘cultural triangle’ – the imperial city of Hué; the ruined Hindu temples of My Son; the former merchant town of Hoi An. We fall in love with Hoi An within minutes. Its riverside setting and centuries-old houses give it a rich feel of history, colourful lanterns hanging along every street. Green and pleasant land: Rice fields are an ever-visible presence in central Vietnam . Each morning, our five-minute walk into town from our riverside hotel, the Anantara, is a feast for the senses – a daily exchange of greetings with the manager of the aptly-named launderette Mr Laundry, an attempt to pass through the throng of locals haggling in a series of giant food markets. The town stretches out into a series of shops, restaurants and cafes – many based in the teak buildings that traders once used. And beyond, the soft sands and ice cold drinks of Cua Dai beach – a 30-minute cycle ride from the hotel – prove just as picturesque. A . six-night package including three nights at Anantara Hoi An (Deluxe . Garden View Room) and three nights at Angsana Lang Co (Deluxe Room) costs from £989 per person, including breakfasts, flights with Cathay . Pacific from London Heathrow and all transfers – via Western Oriental . (020 7666 1234; www.westernoriental.com). Alternatively, . a six-night package including three nights at Anantara Hoi An (Deluxe . Garden View Room) and three nights at Banyan Tree Lang Co (Lagoon Pool . Villa) costs from £1,259 per person, on the same basis.","Vietnam, traditionally a backpacker destination, has a new luxury ethos .

"It occurs shortly before Holy Communion in a Roman Catholic Mass when the priest invites the congregation to offer each other a sign of peace. However, what began as a simple handshake has become in many churches an exuberant exchange of kisses or hugs and now the Vatican wants to stamp out the boisterous practice as it detracts from the solemnity of the service. Cardinal Antonio Canizares Llovera, the leader of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, has written a letter to bishops around the world expressing the church’s concern. The Holy Father prays during his inauguration Mass in St Peter's Square, Vatican City . In a move approved by Pope Francis, Cardinal Llovera has asked bishops to draw up strict new guidelines so that the gesture can be performed with more sobriety and less ‘excess’. The Vatican said it would ‘offer some practical measures to better express the meaning of the sign of peace and to moderate excesses, which create confusion in the liturgical assembly just prior to Communion’. The Vatican would also like priests not to leave the altar to greet parishioners and to refrain from offering congratulations or condolences during the sign of the peace at weddings or funerals . Too much: The Vatican would prefer a simple handshake to hugging each at Mass . It would also like priests not to leave the altar to greet parishioners and to refrain from offering congratulations or condolences during the sign of the peace at weddings or funerals. Father Jose Maria Gil Tamayo, the most senior Spanish bishop, wrote: ‘If the faithful do not understand and do not show, in their ritual gestures, the true significance of the rite of peace, they are weakened in the Christian concept of peace, and their fruitful participation in the Eucharist is negatively affected.’ The move is also supported by Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI previously called for ‘greater restraint in this gesture, which can be exaggerated and cause a certain distraction in the assembly just before the reception of Communion.’","Head of Congregation for Divine Worship has written to bishops worldwide expressing church's concern .

"Chinese officials have warned Pope Francis not to 'interfere' with their country's religion, following a series of overtures from the pontiff to the officially atheist nation. China is one of few countries that has had no diplomatic relations with the Vatican and little contact since shortly after the country's 1949 communist revolution.

Vice president of the state-authorised Catholic Patriotic Association Liu Yuanlong said: 'China will always safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity and it never allows foreign forces to interfere with religion. The Vatican should respect China in terms of the personnel of a diocese.' Francis spoke after receiving a positive response to two goodwill telegrams he sent to President Xi Jinping as he flew over Chinese airspace en route to Korea. He told journalists on the plane that the Vatican respects the 'beautiful noble and wise Chinese people'. 'The Church only asks for liberty for its task, for its work.'

While in Korea Pope Francis told Catholics from across Asia to evangelise the continent, even with others suspicious or intolerant of the church. 'On this vast continent which is home to a great variety of cultures, the church is called to be versatile and creative in her witness to the Gospel through dialogue and openness to all,' 'In this spirit of openness to others, I earnestly hope that those countries of your continent with whom the Holy See does not yet enjoy a full relationship may not hesitate to further a dialogue for the benefit of all,' the pope said.","China is one of few countries with no diplomatic relations with the Vatican .

"The Christian mother who was put on death row in Sudan for refusing to convert to Islam is finally on her way to a new life in the United States. Meriam Ibrahim, who was imprisoned for apostasy after refusing to renounce her Christian faith, left Rome this morning on a flight bound for Philadelphia, according to the campaigner who secured her release. The mother-of-two, accompanied by husband Daniel, a U.S. citizen, and children Martin and Maya will then change planes to fly to New Hampshire, according to Antonella Napoli, director of Italians for Darfur. Scroll down for video . Courage: Meriam Ibrahim holds her daughter Maya in her arms as she leaves Rome for Philadelphia . The family of four are planning to start afresh in America in Manchester, the hometown of Daniel’s brother, Gabriel Wani. They spent the previous week in Rome after being spirited out of Sudan in the dead of night on an Italian state aircraft. Meriam and baby Maya, who was born while her mother as shackled in prison, were blessed by Pope Francis who thanked her for her courage and praised her ‘courageous witness to faith’. The brave mother said she was a little anxious about the new start. Daniel, a trained chemist, lost his job while in Sudan supporting his wife through her ordeal in prison so they will be reliant on their extended family, at least at first. Strong: Meriam Ibrahim (left), with her daughter Maya leaving Rome's Fiumicino Airport for Philadelphia . The entire four will be cramped into Daniel’s one person apartment in Manchester. She said: ‘ I’m a bit scared to leave Rome. We have been very happy here. We have felt like a real family. ‘ . She said that they had toured the city as they waited for the final arrangements to be made for their travel, including an emotional trip to the ancient Roman amphitheatre where thousands of Christians were martyred for their faith. They also prayed in one of the cities most famous churches, St Paul outside the walls. She said: ‘We saw the whole city, we went to the Colosseum, we went to mass on Sunday, and we went shopping. We returned to life. And now I don’t know what to expect but at least we will all be together. ‘ . New start: Meriam and baby Maya were blessed by the Pope during their stay in Italy . Daniel was more confident. He said: ‘My brother will help us I’m sure and the Christian community in New Hampshire will be with us. The future is always unknown but I am optimistic.’ The quotes were relayed by the campaigner Antonella Napoli who saw the couple off at the airport. She said the visit to the the Colosseum 'touched' the courageous Christian but the entire family had been 'moved by the welcome they had received in Rome'. The nightmare began a year ago when Meriam was accused of converting to Christianity, by relatives who allegedly wanted to take over her business. Meriam Ibrahim with her daughter Maya are now hoping for a new start in America with the rest of their family . She insists she was brought up a Christian although her father, who left the family when she was very young, is a Muslim. A month ago Meriam was released but was detained again on the way to the airport pending fresh legal proceedings. After weeks at the US Embassy amid tense negotiations between the Italian and Sudanese authorities she was released and flown to Rome immediately. The couple were given a private apartment during their week in Italy, where they were able to live as a family for the first time since the birth of their daughter. They were kitted out with new clothes and driven around the sights by armed police, for their security. When they arrive at the airport in New Hampshire they are set to be welcomed by the Sudanese and entire Evangelical community, as well as Daniel’s brother and his family.

"Osama bin Laden's relatives have bought the Carrara quarries to their collection . The quarry which produced the stone for London's Marble Arch and Michelangelo's masterpiece David has been bought by Osama Bin Laden's family for £35million. The Al Qaeda chief, who died in 2011 at the hands of US Navy Seals, was one of 53 children of Mohammed Bin Laden - a Yemeni émigré who built up a vast commercial empire. Now his relatives have added the Carrara quarries in Tuscany, which still produce the world's most sought after marble, to their collection of 26 mines. The Bin Laden family now own 50 per cent of the company with permits to mine huge swathes of the quarries near Florence, the setting for the James Bond film Quantum of Solace. Saudi Arabia's Construction Products Holding Company (CPC), part of the Bin Laden family's construction industry conglomerate, acquired the stakes of three Italian families on Wednesday, according to ANSA the Italian news agency. Oil rich Saudi Arabia is already one of the world’s biggest consumers of marble. And it was the Bin Laden’s construction company that was awarded the contract to build the mosque at Mecca in the 1950s that houses Islam’s most holy shrine, using hundreds of tonnes of marble. The family business is the third largest construction company in the world and was already a customer of the quarries. Scroll down for video . The marble was selected by Michaelangelo to give form to Christianity's most cherished characters, including his masterpiece, David . The creamy white stone built Marble Arch in London . Carrara which has been mined since Roman times, produces around £250million worth of stone every year employing 5,000 people. The creamy white stone was valued by the Renaissance masters including da Vinci, who invented a cutting machine for use in the quarry, but later artists including Bernini and Rodin, who used it for his legendary sculpture The Kiss, have continued to demand it. It is thought the Saudi moguls negotiated to buy out the shares of three Italian families for a reported 45 million euros. It was reported by US weekly that at Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's recent wedding in Florence after the ceremony, the guests sat at a 70-metre-long marble banquet table - a gift from master craftsman Gualtiero Vannelli who used marble from the Tuscan quarry in Carrara . The quarries, which have existed since Roman times, are a crucial economic asset at a time when Italy is struggling to lift itself out of recession shipping out 1.4 million tons a year, worth around €300 million (£250million) annually.

"The Pope married 20 couples today, several with children out of wedlock, in the latest demonstration of his more laissez-faire attitude to Catholic teaching. In an extremely rare celebration, Pope Francis presided over the vows of couples who some traditionalists would say were living 'in sin'. The last time a pope performed a marriage was St John Paul II, who wed 16 people at a Mass to mark the Jubilee for Families in October 2000. Pop Francis married 20 couples, several with children out of wedlock,  in a ceremony at the Vatican today . Today, Francis took each couple through their vows in turn - including Gabriella Improta and Guido Tassara, who already had children and . thought such a marriage would be impossible, Radio Vaticana reports. The diocese of Rome had earlier candidly stated: 'The people getting married on Sunday are couples like many . others. Some already . live together, some already have children.' Francis, the first non-European pope in 1,300 years, . has shown extreme tolerance in relation to subjects traditionally taboo in the Church. He recently claimed that the Church must end its obsession with teachings on abortion, contraception and homosexuality, and become more merciful or risk collapsing 'like a house of cards'. Speaking about gay people, he once asked 'who am I to judge' someone 'who seeks God and has good will?'. Guido Tassara, left, and Gabriella Improta,  just married by Pope Francis, exchange rings during a wedding ceremony in St. Peter's Basilica at the Vatican . The Pope believes the Church must end its obsession with teachings on abortion, contraception and homosexuality, and become more merciful, or risk collapsing 'like a house of cards' His liberal approach bears stark contrast with that of his predecessor, the . German Pope Benedict, who said that threats to the traditional . family undermined the future of humanity itself. Francis' latest step will be a boost for those hoping he proposes liberal reforms at a major Vatican conference on sexual and family relationships next month. Many have already been encouraged by signs that the Argentine has a more progressive attitude to issues such as homosexuality. He has even asked the Curia to look into the recognition of civil same sex unions. Francis' latest step will be a boost for those hoping he proposes liberal reforms at a major Vatican conference on sexual and family relationships next month . Hundreds of guests look on as 20 couples are married during a unique ceremony at St. Peter's Basilica . But the Vatican have continued to endorse heterosexual marriage and procreation as God's command. The Synod of Bishops will review Catholic practices on the family and - it is hoped - will decide how to adapt to today's rapidly changing norms while keeping fidelity with the faith. Bishops from around the world will be at next month's meeting on the family, which Francis referred to in today's ceremony 'bricks' on which society is built. Issues such as marriage, . divorce and contraception will also be discussed. The liberal minded Pope is said to have asked the Curia to look into the recognition of civil same sex unions . Three pairs of brides and grooms sit on benches as they wait to be married today in the Vatican . In June, the pope celebrated Mass at the chapel in his Santa Marta residence with 15 couples that were marking 25 to 60 years of marriage. During the service, he said the pillars of a successful marriage were fidelity, perseverance and fertility, but made headlines around the world when he urged couples not to replace children with cats and dogs. He said: 'It might be better — more comfortable — to have a dog, two cats, and the love goes to the two cats and the dog. Is this true or not? Have you seen it? 'Then, in the end this marriage comes to old age in solitude, with the bitterness of loneliness.' A couple lovingly look into each other's eyes before being married in front of huge crowds today . The last time a pope performed a marriage was St John Paul II, who wed eight couples at a Mass to mark the Jubilee for Families in October 2000 .","Pope Francis weds couples some traditionalists would say were 'living in sin'

"It was the picture-perfect holiday island, blighted by the tragedy of the Costa Concordia shipwreck. But now romance has returned to the Mediterranean isle of Giglio- with many of the salvage workers striking up relationships with local girls- causing residents to rename their home ‘Love Island’. And as the giant cruise liner prepares to leave Giglio forever, one British ‘wrecker’ and the local beauty he fell for, are expecting a baby set to heal the wounds of the tragic isle. Scroll down for video . Picture perfect: After meeting him while he was working to salvage the Costa Concordia, Virginia D'Elia, 22, has followed handsome welder Simon Jackson, 36, back to his home in Kent . Virginia D'Elia, 22, has followed handsome welder Simon Jackson, 36, back to his home in Kent and is set to give birth to his baby boy, in mid August. The baby will be named Filippo, after his grandfather, who lived on Giglio and died around the time of the shipwreck. Relatives on the island say it is 'wonderful' that something good has emerged from tragedy. Meanwhile other local girls are preparing to say goodbye to their salvage worker lovers today, as they will depart along with the ship tomorrow. For the past two years, the older . residents of Giglio say, there has been an almost wartime atmosphere on . the island, as some 2000, predominantly male, salvage workers moved in, . with money to spend and testosterone galore. Romance: Virginia and Simon are now expecting a baby boy in mid-August. The baby will be named Filippo after Virginia's grandfather who lived on Giglio and died around the time of the shipwreck . Brooding: The operation to prepare the Costa Concordia to be towed away from the island of Giglio were hampered by heavy rain this morning . Simon’s boss on the island, South African salvage master Nick Sloane, now a national hero in Italy, is renowned for his lewd jokes and for taking nude showers in the garden of his villa every day. The island has only a permanent population of 800 in winter so local girls had their pick of the uniformed muscular foreigners. Virginia’s aunt, Liliana Fanciulli, who owns the hotel on Giglio where her niece was working when she met Simon, said: ‘ The baby is due in mid August. It is a boy-they are going to call him Filippo. ‘ . ‘They are so in love -they are a beautiful couple. There are no plans to marry at the moment but he is a great guy, she loves him and now they are having a baby together. That is enough.’ ‘The family are very happy.

Happy: Virginia's relatives on the island say it is 'wonderful' that something good has finally emerged from the Costa Concordia tragedy . Simon, a salvage expert who runs a family welding business in Sussex, was her niece’s first serious boyfriend, she said. The pair met in a bar and soon began taking romantic walks around the island together. At first they could barely communicate as she spoke only a little English and he only broken Italian. When Simon was not on shift they would go out with friends and his colleagues to the nightspots in the port. On the night of the parbuckling operation last September, in which the ship was wrested from the rocks in an unprecedented engineering coup, the couple were seen clinging to each other with emotion, before Simon had to board the wreck in a dangerous mission. Soon after, mission accomplished, the couple moved to the UK where Virginia began an English course. A group of tourists have their picture taken in front of the wreck of the Costa Concordia as it is re-floated. The cruise liner is expected to be towed away from Giglio tomorrow . Romance: Three young people sit on a stone wall on the island of Giglio while work to re-float of the wreck of the Costa Concordia cruise ship continues in the early hours of this morning . She quickly became pregnant. The pair have since been back twice to visit relatives but decided not to visit for the removal of the ship given Virginia is due in a few weeks. But the other couples will be soon saying their goodbyes. One of Simon’s former colleagues at salvage company Titan said: ‘We will be sad to go. There have been at tens if not dozens of romances, not all of them serious of course. All the single lads have had a local girlfriend pretty much.' Donatella Botti, a friend of Virginia’s, who runs a local bar in the town of Castello, said : ‘All over Giglio the girls are weeping today because the salvage workers are leaving. ‘Here on this island we know every single person by name. So they have become part of our family. They have changed our lives. ‘We don’t want them to leave.

"Naomi Campbell paid an undisclosed damages to Italian photographer after an alleged attack that put him in hospital . Supermodel Naomi Campbell has paid undisclosed damages to an Italian photographer after an alleged attack that put him in hospital. The settlement was revealed as the 44-year-old went on trial for the alleged assault on Gaetano Di Giovanni, who she is accused of battering and scratching after he took pictures of her with her billionaire ex-boyfriend . Mr Di Giovanni claimed his face was scratched and bruised after Campbell allegedly slapped him and hit him with her handbag, damaging his left eye with her nails. The model, known for her fiery temper, denies the allegations and has claimed she was besieged by paparazzi while on holiday in the picture-perfect Aeolian islands, off the coast of Sicily. The incident took place on the Mediterranean paradise island of Lipari in July 2009 when Miss Campbell was on holiday with her ex boyfriend Vladimir Doronin, a Russian mogul. The pair had arrived on the island on a 120 feet yacht belonging to billionaire playboy friend Mikhail Prokhorov, after spending several days in the south of France. After venturing onto the island for dinner the pair returned to the marina to rejoin the yacht ‘Lady in Blue’. Pictures taken that night appear to capture the moment the local photographer attempted to snap a picture of the model. ‘She flew at him screaming gibberish’, one witness told Italian media, ‘before being dragged away by her own bodyguards.’ The fashion icon’s ‘nails had damaged his left eye’, Mr Di Giovanni told Italian newspaper La Repubblica at the time. The incident took place on the Mediterranean paradise island of Lipari in July 2009 when Campbell was on holiday with her ex boyfriend Vladimir Doronin, a Russian mogul . He said: ‘First she hit with her bag, screaming at me and then she tried to slap me. ‘I managed to avoid her – but her nails still got my eye. ‘For a few seconds I could not see a thing. I could hear that her bodyguards and her boyfriend were trying to drag her away.’ He said his eye was damaged and did not recover for three days, a claim that he said was backed up by doctors. The model, known for her temper, denies the allegations and has claimed she was besieged by paparazzi while on holiday in the picture-perfect Aeolian islands, off the coast of Sicily . Mr Di Giovanni’s lawyer confirmed his . client had settled with Campbell but declined to say how much she . had paid. Angelo Pajno said: ‘My client has withdrawn his complaint and . dropped the civil case, but will appear as a witness at the criminal . trial’. A lawyer for Campbell, Francesca Getty, said that the photographer had now withdrawn his claim. She . said: ‘We maintain that our client will be absolved and we hope to . demonstrate exactly the dynamic on the island that night.’ The model was not planning to attend any of the trial hearings, she added. An aide, who was with Campbell at the time, said: 'The incident took place in July 2009 as Naomi was entering a church to light a candle on the anniversary of Gianni Versace’s death, an intimate moment that anyone would hope be respected and kept private. 'The photographer engineered a situation where he could take advantage of Naomi to make financial gain and it reads of nothing more than extortion.' Under . Italian law she is not obliged to attend court, although judges can . look more favourably on accused that show respect to the court by taking . part. In 2009 the Streatham-born model admitted attacking police at Heathrow in a row over lost luggage. She also pleaded guilty to assaulting her maid in 2007.

"Captain calamity: Francesco Schettino pictured leaving court in Grosseto, Italy, last September. He recently gave a talk to students on 'panic control' Costa Concordia captain Francesco Schettino has sparked outrage by giving a lecture on 'panic control' while standing trial for wrecking the luxury liner he was commanding killing 32 people. Schettino, 52, dubbed 'Captain Calamity' after he steered the Costa Concordia on to rocks, gave a two hour talk to students as part of their criminal science masters course. He is facing charges of abandoning ship, causing a disaster and multiple manslaughter - with prosecutors claiming his poor handling of the disaster added to the tragedy. It is claimed that Schettino had been invited to speak by Professor Vincenzo Mastronardi, who teaches at the La Sapienza University's Faculty of Medicine in Rome, Italy. Prof Mastronardi denies inviting Schettino, claiming he simply turned up 'by surprise' ten minutes before the lecture was due to start. Schettino took to the microphone at an off campus event after a 3D reconstruction of the sinking of the Concordia off the island of Giglio in 2012 was shown to the students by engineer Ivan Paduano. Schettino then told the audience at the Aviator Club in Rome that what had happened to him was 'only an accident' - failing to mention how he had told investigators he had 'tripped and stumbled into a lifeboat' the night of the disaster. Prosecutors say he failed to notify authorities quickly enough of the seriousness of what had happened to the Concordia and that he had abandoned the ship when there were more than 300 passengers and crew still on board. Witness have told his trial that in the minutes after the liner struck rock a 'panic stricken Schettino ran his fingers through his hair shouting Madonna what have I done' - only adding to questions over the suitability of him giving the lecture. He spoke of his experiences as a cruise ship captain adding that he had been asked to give the talk as he was 'an expert'. Schettino said: 'I had to illustrate how best to control panic management - or better still how a human being behaves in situations of that nature. 'I have voyaged across all the oceans of the world. I know how to react when these situations arise and how to react when you have an ethnically diverse crew. Every choice I made had fundamental human component. 'There are academic studies which compare what happened the disaster of the Costa Concordia to other similar tragedies. For example, the Twin Towers, how is that during that attack people threw themselves from windows but didn't do the same on the Concordia? I was actually given an academic award for my presentation.' Lifeboats stream from the sinking Costa Concordia: Prosecutors say Schettino abandoned the ship in a panic when there were more than 300 passengers and crew still on board. The disaster killed 32 people . Human remains, thought to be those of the last missing victim of the Costa Concordia, have been found, a week after the vessel was towed to the scrapyard. Twenty-one months after the cruise liner hit rocks and sank off the coast of Tuscany, bones thought to be those of heroic Indian waiter Russel Rebello were spotted by divers. A specialised team of police frogmen began the search for Mr Rebello, who refused a place on a lifeboat to stay behind and help passengers, on Tuesday morning. A skull and part of a hand have been found on the ship's fourth deck, Italian newspaper La Repubblica reported. Genoa Prosecutor Federico Manotti has ordered a DNA test on the remains to establish whether they are that of Rebello or those of an Italian woman who was the last victim to be recovered from the wreck in October 2013. 'Both the families of Russel Rebello and Maria Grazia Tricarichi have been informed because we can't rule out the possibility that the remains are hers,' the police said in a statement. However today the news sparked outrage, with Italian media labelling it another 'shocking embarrassment' for the country - reminding people how Schettino had also been ordered to 'Get back on board for f***'s sake' by a furious coastguard official after he confessed he had left the Concordia. La Sapineza's chancellor Luigi Frati said: 'We distance ourselves from this serious episode and condemn it profoundly. Professor Mastronardi has been referred to the university's Ethics Committee for a disciplinary investigation.' Francesco Verusio, who is prosecuting Schettino, said: 'I am completely speechless at how some things are allowed to happen in this country. How on earth can someone invite Schettino to give a lecture at a university? 'How can a university professor, a man of culture and who is supposed to transmit to young people the principles of university education invite Schettino? What sort of image does that give our country? 'He gave a two hour lecture and then he was awarded a diploma. A diploma for what? I hope the students made fun of him.' Professor Mastronardi said: 'It's right that I have been referred to a disciplinary hearing - I would have done the same in a similar situation, it gives me the opportunity to clarify matters in the appropriate venue. 'All I will say is that I did not invite Schettino, he just turned up ten minutes before the lecture started completely by surprise. He explained that if he had immediately lowered the anchors the ship would have sunk straight away. 'He told the audience that by handing the psychology of the situation he had to ensure not to cause alarm and create a panic.'","Francesco Schettino gave a two-hour lecture to university students in Milan .

"Apologetic: Pope Francis has revealed that he was forced to cancel a visit to a Papal hospital in Rome last month because he was suffering from a severe headache and nausea . Pope Francis has revealed that he was ill when he cancelled a key appointment last month, saying 'we have to accept fragility'. The Pope said he was suffering from a severe headache accompanied by nausea when he dropped out of a visit to the Papal Hospital in Rome at the last minute. Previously the Vatican had claimed he was suffering from 'a slight indisposition'. The visit on June 27 was to mark the 50th anniversary of the Agostino Gemelli hospital, where Popes John Paul II and Benedict were treated and a suite of rooms is on permanent standby in case of Papal need. Francis told Catholic TV station TV2000 on Sunday: 'Everything was ready, indeed, as you know, my closest colleagues were already waiting at the Gemelli, but, a few minutes before I was due to leave a severe headache that I had had since the morning and that I hoped would pass got worse, and along with it came nausea, so as things were, I could not go.' Apologising to the sick and the hospital staff, he said: 'You should know that I really wanted meet you but as you know we are not masters of our own lives, we cannot arrange things to suit us. We have to accept fragility.' Fears for Francis's health surfaced after he cancelled a series of meetings in May and June. The Pope, who rises at 4.30am every day, has been a whirlwind of activity since his election, but his advisers have been urging him to take a break after 17 months without a holiday. Francis has some underlying health problems, including sciatica and had part of one of his lungs removed in his youth. Close collaborator Cardinal Oscar Rodriguez Maradiaga of Honduras said: 'We have been asking him to have holidays this year. 'Because last year he didn’t and sometimes he’s very tired. So I think that during August he’s going to retire to rest.' Disappointed: Staff at the Gemeli Hospital in Rome erected a homemade banner welcoming Pope Francis, but the Vatican announced the Pontiff had an 'unexpected disposition' an hour after he was due to arrive . Traditionally, popes moved to the papal summer palace at Castel Gandolfo outside Rome during the summer months. Last year, Francis worked straight through the summer. Papal aides reportedly say that Francis thrives off a fast pace and 'eats work' and finds it hard to relinquish control to others. Some observers have claimed the pontiff has gained weight since his election and is having difficulty breathing, which they say could be a sign of a heart condition.","Pontiff said he was suffering from severe headache and nausea .

"Silvio Berlusconi has been sensationally cleared of having sex with underage exotic dancer Ruby the Heartstealer at his notorious 'bunga bunga' parties. The former Italian premier, 77, had been sentenced to seven years jail for sex with the Moroccan former nightclub dancer, real name Karima-El Mahroug when she was just 17 and for using his influence to get her released from police cutody. But in a shock verdict, judges in Milan overturned the conviction on appeal, saying that the facts 'do not constitute a crime.' Scroll down for video . Cause for celebration: Former Italian premier Silvio Berlusconi pictured today after his conviction for having sex with an underage exotic dancer was overturned . The billionaire politician, who had always denied having sex with Ruby at sordid sex parties at his palatial villa outside Milan said he was 'deeply moved' by the verdict. He said: 'Only those close to me over the years know how I have suffered at these unjust and defamatory accusations. 'My first thoughts today go to my loved ones, who have suffered with me years of media aggression, gossip, slander, and who have remained beside me with unmatched affection and serenity. 'I have always said that the vast majority of Italian judges do their work quietly, with admirable balance and rigour, something that was confirmed today.' Berlusconi was convicted for having sex with Karima El Mahroug, nicknamed 'Ruby the Heart Stealer' when she was 17 . Berlusconi . had always claimed the parties were 'elegant dinners' followed by . burlesque cabaret, but the court heard of poledancing, strip teases and . erotic games, all performed for the benefit of the master of the house. A troupe of girls had received cash and gifts for attending the dinners. The . ex prime minister was also accused of telling police that Ruby was the . niece of deposed Egyptian dictator Hosni Mubarrak in order to get her . released from jail. But the judges said that these allegations were 'unfounded'. The judges have three months to fully explain their reasoning. But lawyer for the defence Franco Coppi said it was a verdict that is 'even better our rosiest predictions.' He said: 'From a rational point of view the judges could not but absolve him. It could be that the judges said the crime did not exist because the ex-premier did not know that Ruby was underage.' 'The absolution for abuse of office is easier to understand', he said, 'because it means simply the proof is inexistent.' The flamboyant politician heard the news at the old people's home where he is currently serving a one year sentence of community service for tax fraud in connection to the acquisition of rights for Hollywood films. The media mogul has been tried more than thirty times but convicted only once definitively. The verdict could herald the start of a political comeback. While he has been banned from holding political office personally, Berlusconi is still head of the opposition centre right Forza Italia party. In a brief statement read out in court, the judges fully acquitted 77-year old Berlusconi on both charges. They will release their motivations in 90 days. 'A verdict that goes beyond our rosiest expectations,' Berlusconi's lawyer Franco Coppi told reporters. The four-times prime minister, still the most influential politician on the centre right, had always denied the charges, accusing the Milan magistrates of hounding him for political reasons. 'Finally justice has been done' said Simone Furlan of Berlusconi's Forza Italia party in a statement. 'Now, let's all focus on good politics to relaunch Forza Italia, tightly knit around our great leader Silvio Berlusconi.' Friday's . verdict in the most sensational trial faced by Berlusconi is not . definitive as prosecutors could lodge an appeal with Italy's top court. The former Italian prime minister was also accused of telling police that Ruby was the niece of deposed Egyptian dictator Hosni Mubarrak in ordern to get her released from jail . The final ruling in the so-called Ruby trial could have implications for Berlusconi and his freedom to engage in political activity beyond the case itself. As well as its implications for Berlusconi himself, the verdict removes a potential threat to Prime Minister Matteo Renzi's constitutional reform drive, which depends on an accord with the centre-right. That accord could have been threatened had Berlusconi's conviction been upheld. Berlusconi received a definitive conviction for tax fraud last year and was stripped of his seat in parliament. He was given a four-year jail sentence, but that was commuted to a year's community service under a general amnesty, leaving him largely free to campaign in elections and play a political role. However, a second definitive conviction in a criminal trial would violate the terms of the amnesty. That could mean Berlusconi would have to serve time under house arrest.","Former PM was convicted for having sex with dancer when she was 17 .

"Legend: Lollobrigida was once dubbed 'the most beautiful woman in the world' Sixties screen siren Gina Lollobrigida has won a bitter legal tussle with her son over her vast fortune. Only . son and heir Andrea Mirko Skofic had wanted to wrest control of her . estimated £30 million estate from the 87-year-old actress, claiming she . had fallen under the sway of several young male admirers. Last . year the screen goddess once dubbed 'The Most Beautiful Woman in the . World' took legal action against her former toyboy lover over claims he . married her by proxy without her knowledge to get his hands on her . money. Mr Skofic had asked . for her estate, including properties in Italy and Monte Carlo, to be . managed by a court-appointed administrator. He . told Italian newspaper Il Messaggero earlier this year: ‘My mother . needs an administrator - I fear she may no longer be capable of handling . her affairs by herself.’ The lifestyle of his mother recently seen in . the company of a 'very young manager,' had given Mr Skofic reason for . concern, the newspaper reported. However . on Wednesday a judge in Rome rejected the request, ruling that the . octogenarian diva was perfectly capable of managing her own finances. According . to a statement put out by the Hollywood star's agent, Paola Comin, the . judge's ruling 'found that Ms Lollobrigida had no need of an . administrator as she is, from a mental point of view, autonomous, . coherent and lucid, in the light of an excellent interview with her. 'The prosecutor was of the same opinion that there was no substance to . any supposition to the contrary.' She . added: 'Gina Lollobrigida is left with the profound bitterness of a . mother having to face and fight this deeply sad occurrence.' 'She always had faith in the understanding and reasoning of the judges and today that faith has been rewarded.' Sham wedding?

The case has additionally damaged the image . of Ms Lollobrigida because of the pre-emptive media coverage, they . said. The actress, known for . her rivalry with fellow Italian Sophia Loren, made headlines the world . over last year when she claimed that her former boyfriend paid an . impersonator to stand in for her at a proxy wedding in Spain in 2010.

"Legend: Lollobrigida was once dubbed 'the most beautiful woman in the world' Hollywood legend Gina Lollobrigida has hit out at her only son after the pair were locked in a ‘horrendous’ legal fight over her £30 million fortune. Andrea Milko Skofic, 56, Miss Lollobrigida’s only son and heir, had asked a court in Rome to appoint a judge to oversee her wealth amid claims that she had been duped into marrying Spaniard Javier . Rigau y Rafols, a businessman 34 years her junior. Mr Skofic claimed his mother had become ‘unable to think for herself’. But the Sixties’ screen siren, who starred in films including Trapeze and The Hunchback Of Notre Dame, labelled her son’s legal battle a ‘dirty, ugly business’. Miss Lollobrigida, 87, said: ‘I’m speechless that my son could consider taking this to court. 'I’m delighted the request was dismissed but I would have preferred it if none of this had ever come to court.’ The actress met Rafols at a party in Monte Carlo in the 1980s.

"Some wear GPS devices that are constantly monitored by police. Others have fled their homes; repudiated by the local community for being a registered sex offender. And all of them - from those charged with possessing child pornography to ones caught having sex with a minor and molestation - are there to 'repent their sins'. Welcome to Miracle Village, a tiny church town spanning about 20 acres on the edge of Everglades in south Florida, which was established in 2009 as a spiritual safe haven for sex offenders and their families. With a population of about 200, it is believed to be the largest sex offender community in the United States. Scroll down for video . Spiritual safe haven: Set in the sugarcane country of south Florida, Miracle Village is a tiny town of bungalow-style houses where about 200 sex offenders and their families co-exist . Tight-knit community:  The village was originally constructed for laborers who worked in the surrounding sugarcane fields, and was transformed in 2009 by the late evangelical pastor Dick Witherow, a former sex offender himself . United: The tiny community has provided a home for registered sex offenders, who struggle to find housing in Florida because they cannot come within at least 1,000 feet of children, or risk being sent to prison . Parish: Miracle Village is an intensely religious community, who welcome sex offenders based on the belief they will repent their sins . Co-existing: Many of the women who live in the town are the wives of offenders, however there is at least one female sex offender among the population of about 200 . Brooklyn-based photographer Noah Rabinowitz has captured a fascinating inside look at the town, which is surrounded by sugarcane fields and was built in the 1960s to house workers. He spent three days taking pictures and talking with the residents who gave him permission. 'There are no violent criminals in the town, [which is] a strict guideline to admission,' Rabinowitz told Feature Shoot. 'It is a deeply religious, tight knit and strictly self-governed community.' 'I wanted to treat the offenders and non-offenders in the same manner and instead think about the town as an example of a self-governed community built around common experience, whatever that might be.' While the town looks and sounds like a colony of outcasts with no other option, it is actually a highly sought-after place to live. Finding housing as a sex offender in Florida is almost impossible, with state laws forbidding them to go within 1,000 feet of schools, playgrounds, parks or any other place there might be children. Different cities and counties have increased that distance to 2,500, or half a mile. Additionally, a lot of offenders come out of prison with little to no money. 'Application numbers are very high and admission, based on a voting system, is very selective,' Rabinowitz said. 'Moral and ethical judgments aside, the residents are trying to live out their American Dream, in the only way the law and society will allow. 'Some discuss their hopes for life after their time in Miracle Village, but many find it to be a safe place and wish to stay.' Post-prison: The bungalow community offers sex offenders a place to live with their families without judgement . Unbiased: Photographer Noah Rabinowitz said he aimed to document a community that was self-governed, not what brought the people there . Home: The residents of Miracle Village greatly vary in both age and circumstance . Studies: Miracle Village offers classes, such as sexual purity and anger management, as well as psychological treatment programs . Photographer Noah Rabinowitz spent three days in the village, photographing those who gave permission to do so . Familial: A few children do live at Miracle Village. Florida's laws don't stop sex offenders from living in the same neighbourhood as minors, but probation conditions often prevent them having any contact with them . Shunned: Most of the people who live in the colony have been turned away from their homes following their convictions . Regular meetings: There are classes available that give counsel for sexual purity, anger management and other issues . Self-governed: While all the villagers chip in to help, such as maintaining the grounds, some have jobs in nearby towns . Simple: All the homes are more or less the same size and style . Distance: Surround by sugarcane fields, farmers in the background can be seen burning off the extraneous leaves around their crop . Farmland: Miracle Village looks an island in the middle of a sugarcane oasis . Miracle Village was set up by the late evangelical pastor Dick Witherow, according to ABC News. Witherow came close to being charged with statutory rape as a 18-year-old after getting his 14-year-old girlfriend pregnant. He would teach a sexual purity to those living there each week. There are also anger management and bible study classes. Most of the sex offenders are required to attended psychological treatment programs as part of the conidtions of their probation. Others have jobs in the surrounding towns, the nearest of which is two miles away. Many nearby residents relocated after Miracle Village was founded, and a bus stop that was out front of the village entrance was moved so no children would come near the community. Modest: Almost all the bungalow-style houses date back to the 1960's, when the tiny town was first built . Rudimentary: A self-made clothesline pictured at Miracle Village in south Florida . Commonality: Everyone in the religious community know each other and often socialize together . Going about their lives: Half of the residents are registered sex offenders, while the other half are spouses and family members . Supportive: The people work together to manage the grounds and help each other . Roots: The village was built on religion and centered around the church .","Miracle Village, just outside Everglades in south Florida, was established in 2009 by the late evangelical pastor Dick Witherow .

"Five fractures: Retired teacher Jean Duggleby suffered several broken bones before she was diagnosed with osteoporosis . Jean Duggleby was lifting her bicycle into the boot of her car when she felt her back crack. 'I've always been fit so it never occurred to me that I'd broken a bone, I thought I'd pulled a muscle,' says the retired teacher from North-East London. She was 61 at the time. 'I was disappointed to have to postpone my bike ride - and couldn't believe I was still in agony days later.' But it wasn't a pulled muscle - Jean had fractured a vertebra in her spine. She was suffering from osteoporosis, characterised by 'fragility' fractures in the bone. These fractures occur most commonly in the wrist, spine or hip, and are often unexpected, coming after a minor bump or a fall from standing height. But, unfortunately Jean didn't learn this until it was too late. Instead, a week afterwards, Jean went to her GP and asked for an investigation. 'He said there was no need and didn't do even a cursory examination,' she says. He sent her home and told her to take painkillers and touch her toes every morning. Incredibly, it took eight years - and four more spinal fractures - before she was finally referred for a DXA (dual energy  X-ray absorptiometry) scan to check her bone density. The fifth fracture happened when she missed her footing stepping off a boat and fell on her backside. 'One of the other fractures was after picking up shopping, another just pushing a trolley along,' says Jean. 'Each time I suffered weeks of pain. And each time I went to the doctor but was told there was no problem and it would get better on its own. 'During that period my younger sister had been diagnosed with severe osteoporosis, but even though I explained all this to the doctor, he insisted that there was nothing seriously wrong with me. 'I was in such pain with the final fracture that I kept going back to the surgery and on the third visit, I saw a new doctor who referred me to hospital,' she recalls. 'The DXA scan was sufficiently worrying for me to be sent for an MRI scan a few days later and the resulting image clearly showed the five spinal fractures I'd suffered. It brought back some unpleasant memories, I can tell you.' Her experience is horribly common. Around 2.3 million people in the UK, mainly women over 50, have osteoporosis. The cause can be genetic, hormonal or result from lifestyle factors such as smoking, drinking or having a low body mass index (BMI) - being too light means the bones aren't stressed enough to produce new bone cells. Porous: What happens to the bone when affected by osteoporosis . Medications such as steroids, and digestive disorders such as coeliac disease (which affect the absorption of nutrients) can cause osteoporosis in younger people. And while broken wrists and backs mend relatively easily, the true hazard of osteoporosis is the huge increased risk of hip fracture - every year in Britain it leads to 89,000 broken hips, which can often prove fatal. 'Hip fracture is associated with a threefold increase in the risk of premature death - with one in four people dying within a year of breaking their hip and thousands more becoming dependent on carers and services,' says Dr Jonathan Treml, associate director for falls and bone health at the Royal College of Physicians. 'That's why anyone over 50 who suffers a fragility fracture should be tested for osteoporosis and given correct treatment.' Yet many doctors still regard increased risk of fracture as a normal part of ageing, like wrinkles or grey hair. A report from the National Osteoporosis Society revealed sufferers endure three fractures on average before diagnosis - with one in five having another fracture within a year of their first. Experts agree that the key to tackling this is Fracture Liaison Services, linked to a hospital's A&E department - or in a fracture clinic or community clinic staffed by GPs. 'These patients might as well have signs . on their foreheads saying: “I've got osteoporosis. Do something!” Yet . they are sent home with reassuring noises.' Where these services are in place, hip fracture rates are being reduced by around 3 per cent a year (bucking the trend throughout most of Britain, where hip fractures are increasing by around 1.5 per cent year on year). In 2009, the Department of Health called for a fracture liaison service to be available for 'every local population'. Yet worrying evidence from the Royal College of Physicians shows that four years later, only one in three local health authorities has a designated fracture liaison service. Further, GPs as well as hospital doctors are still 'failing to instigate conversations about bone health with those at risk,' says the National Osteoporosis Society. 'It's staggering that one in two hip fractures are preceded by at least one previous fracture,' says Graham Davenport, GP and clinical champion for osteoporosis at the Royal College of General Practitioners. There should be widespread alarm that so many patients presenting with a fragility fracture are sent home without a DXA scan, adds Dr Alun Cooper, a Crawley GP who helped write the national guidelines on osteoporosis. 'These patients might as well have signs on their foreheads saying: “I've got osteoporosis. Do something!” Yet they are sent home with reassuring noises.' The failure is almost always organisational, says Dr Treml. 'If there's no system in place for good communication between hospital and general practice to identify who takes responsibility for following up fragility fractures, you can't expect individual doctors to initiate this essential assessment.' Perhaps equally significant is the problem of getting the right treatment for patients - and ensuring people with the disease understand the importance of taking the medication. Debilitating effect: A new report reveals that sufferers of the condition endure three fractures on average before their osteoporosis is diagnosed . The mid-Nineties saw the launch of the first highly-effective drugs, known as bisphosphonates, which have been shown to halve the risk of a further fracture. Yet as with many long-term diseases where there are no 'scary' symptoms to jolt patients into taking a daily pill, many don't take their osteoporosis medication. Motivation is even more of a problem with bisphosphonates, as it can take up to two years before bone density is seen to improve. By then, four out of five patients have stopped taking their medication - within the first year, according to some studies. A further complication is evidence that bisphosphonates can - in rare circumstances - cause a slight increase in an unusual type of hip fracture after five to ten years of continuous use. 'We now know that some patients need a “drug holiday” of one to two years after taking medication for around five years,' says Professor Cyrus Cooper, chair of the International Osteoporosis Foundation Scientific Committee. Fracture liaison services can help by providing specialists to motivate patients to stick with long-term drug therapy and make lifestyle changes such as taking up weight-bearing exercise - as well as monitoring bone density in case a drug holiday is needed. Jean Duggleby's story shows the value of such a regimen. Since her diagnosis in 2011, she's been taking bisphosophonates along with vitamin D and calcium, and doing regular Pilates. Her bone density increased by 12 per cent in just one year, although her bones are still weaker than they should be. The National Osteoporosis Society is now appealing to patients to take responsibility for their own care by insisting on getting fragility fractures adequately treated and asking their doctor about a bone check. 'When people are aware they have the condition, more steps can be taken to reduce unnecessary fractures,' says the society's director Claire Severgnini. Jean wishes such advice had been available ten years ago. 'I used to be able to walk 14 miles a day. But I've been in constant pain since the last fracture, despite two operations. Now I struggle to walk four miles. In any case I have to be careful all the time and I have to leave the heavy lifting to my partner. 'I watch my best friend, who is the same age as me, out climbing mountains in Snowdonia. We used to match each other and it's changed my life knowing I can no longer join her. It means my social life has narrowed and it's not fair.'","Around 2.3m people in the UK, mainly women over 50, have the condition .

"Double mastectomy: Angelina Jolie opted for pre-emptive surgery after discovering it would virtually eliminate her high risk of breast cancer . Sophie Graham understands better than most the heartbreak behind Angelina Jolie’s double mastectomy. Jolie opted for pre-emptive surgery after discovering it would virtually eliminate her high risk of breast cancer due to a faulty BRCA1 gene — the same gene linked to her mother’s death from ovarian cancer at 57. The film star also plans to have her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed to reduce her higher risk of ovarian cancer. And just this week it was revealed that the star’s aunt had died of breast cancer, aged 61. Debbie Martin, the sister of Jolie’s mother, also carried the faulty BRCA1 gene. Sophie, 39, has the same faulty gene. The occupational psychologist from West London was, like Jolie, given frightening odds of developing these gynaecological cancers. She was tested for the faulty gene nine years ago after her mother, who had ovarian cancer, was found to carry it. Her mother died a few months after she took the test. But Sophie agonises over whether to have her breasts and ovaries removed. ‘I’m not convinced that having a double mastectomy will make a real difference to my health prospects, given the effectiveness of breast screening,’ says the mother of a three-year-old girl. ‘But I feel that getting rid of my ovaries is critical, mainly because ovarian cancer is hard to detect and treat, and it will also have a preventative impact on breast cancer. Yet it’s terrifying as it will propel me into an early menopause, with everything that involves.’ But some experts aren’t convinced that removing healthy tissue is protective. Furthermore, they fear that genetic tests such as the one Jolie had could create an ever-growing group of ‘worried well’: women and men whose life is changed for the worse as the discovery of the faulty gene means they face surgery to remove healthy body parts. For while it’s relatively rare to have faulty BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, a far larger group of ‘cancer predisposition genes’ have been identified, with a new test for these due to be launched in 2014. Known as the TruSight Cancer Panel, the test — which costs a few hundred pounds — checks for 97 genes linked to a greater risk of cancer. From next year, it will be available to all newly diagnosed cancer patients; it’s estimated around 2 per cent every year will be found to have one or more of these genes. The relatives of these patients will also be offered the test. The results will enable doctors to tailor therapies to patients with cancer. For their relatives, the information will mean that ‘screening or preventative measures can be employed’, explains Professor Nazneen Rahman, head of genetics at the Institute of Cancer Research. Yet such tests open up the possibility that not just breasts and ovaries, but other healthy body parts — such as the thyroid gland or moles — could be removed as a preventative measure. Last week, it was reported that a 53-year-old London man has become the first person in the world to have his prostate removed after discovering he has a faulty BRCA2 gene. This is despite the fact there’s only limited evidence that having the faulty gene will mean a man has an increased chance of developing an aggressive form of prostate cancer. ‘Removal of the prostate is radical surgery that can cause serious long-term side-effects including erectile dysfunction and incontinence. We do not advocate at this stage that other men with this gene fault but no known cancer are offered prostate removal,’ says Dr Sarah Cant, of Prostate Cancer UK. One leading expert who is not convinced about the case for removing healthy tissue is Ian Fentiman, professor of surgical oncology at Guy’s Hospital, London. ‘Future generations will look back in horror at the practice of cutting off a woman’s breasts in the belief that it will prevent cancer,’ he says. ‘Sadly, for some women this may prove a vain hope.’ Professor Fentiman was one of the first clinicians to recognise the potential for ‘difficult consultations’ resulting from the breakthrough in identifying the faulty BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Passing: Angelina's aunt Debbie passed away early Sunday morning hours after being taken off life support . Writing in the British Medical Journal in 1998, he warned that he and his colleagues would be faced with ‘an increasing number of well‑informed young women with pathological mutations’ for whom ‘no proved preventative approaches will obliterate the risk’. In the Nineties, Professor Fentiman called for all cases of preventative mastectomy to be recorded on a central register, so women subsequently diagnosed with breast cancer could be identified to show if the operation was beneficial. ‘I discussed it with the Department Of Health, but nothing was ever done,’ he told the Mail this week.Instead, the predictions about how much preventative surgery reduces the risks are based on studies of small groups of women over short periods of time. For instance, one carried out at the University of Pennsylvania followed 139 women with the faulty genes, 76 of whom underwent a preventative mastectomy. After two-and-a-half years, there were no cases of breast cancer in the group who  had surgery, compared with eight cancers in those who did not have the op. Another study at the Mayo Clinic in the U.S. found that three out of 214 women developed breast cancer over three years following a preventative mastectomy. Mother and daughter: The star's mother, Marcheline Bertrand, tragically passed award from the disease in 2007 . ‘We’d have much better information if we’d been able to follow every woman with the faulty gene who has undergone a preventative double mastectomy,’ says Professor Fentiman. ‘As it is, we don’t even know how many women have had the operation in the UK.’ And while we don’t have a clear picture of how extensively the surgery prevents cancer, there is evidence non-surgical preventative strategies do work. Last year, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommended preventative anti-oestrogen treatment for women at increased risk of breast cancer but who’ve never had the disease. For the first time, hormonal medications, particularly tamoxifen, are recommended for healthy women with the faulty BRCA1 gene — with research suggesting these reduce the incidence of breast cancer in cancer gene carriers by 49 per cent. A major study by Cambridge University following 5,000 men and women with the faulty genes is also investigating how far changes in lifestyle, such as exercise and nutrition, reduce the cancer risk. There’s evidence, too, showing the risk of dying is reduced by annual screening (with MRI scans for women with the faulty BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes between the ages of 30 and 50; after that age, annual mammograms). A major U.S. study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in 2010 analysed survival rates in women with the cancer genes and found that those who undergo intensive surveillance live as long as those who have their breast tissue removed — though they are more likely to develop breast cancer. But it is also important to note that having the faulty gene does not mean cancer is inevitable, says Jackie Harris, clinical nurse specialist at the charity Breast Cancer Care. ‘Breast cancer is not a genetic disease like Huntington’s where the defective gene guarantees the development of the disease. Having a cancer gene increases the risk of cancer, but you may also die in old age of something else entirely.’ Fighting on: Angelina, pictured with fiance Brad Pitt, bravely revealed she had undergone a double mastectomy in February after being identified as carrying the BRCA1 cancer gene . Yet psychologically, it seems, there’s much appeal in ‘being proactive’, as Angelina Jolie put it, by surgically removing healthy tissue. Indeed, the opportunity for prophylactic surgery can give women found to have the cancer gene the feeling of being back in control, says Dr Susan Cleator, breast oncologist at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust. ‘It’s a different option to picking up a cancer that has already developed and which may require radiotherapy and chemotherapy as well as surgery within a short time frame,’ she says. ‘Prophylactic surgery can be planned with plenty of time to consider breast reconstruction options and almost certainly avoids the need for further treatment.’ Sophie has so far chosen intensive surveillance — with annual breast scans and ultrasound of her ovaries. A few weeks ago, however, news of a cousin with terminal ovarian cancer at the age of 31 has forced her to reconsider. As a mother already, Sophie can’t imagine wanting more children, not least as she was divorced last year.  ‘Yet making a decision that ends that option is also tough — even though keeping my ovaries feels as though I’m playing Russian roulette with four bullets in the gun.’ Despite her concerns, Sophie has no doubt where she stands on genetic testing. ‘For me, knowledge is power. The fact that my mother was dissuaded from being tested and didn’t know that she had the BRCA1 gene until it was too late still plagues us as a family,’ she says. ‘I spend lots of time going to screening appointments, and the knowledge that I’ve got to bite the bullet torments me. But I am the lucky one — I have the power to make an informed choice.’","Sophie Graham has the same faulty BRCA1 gene .

"Hillary Clinton spent her summer vacation in the Hamptons picking her wealthy friends' brains about jobs and the economy, a weekend profile on the presumed 2016 presidential candidate disclosed. When Clinton wasn't promoting her book Hard Choices or enjoying some R&R at the beach last month, she was making the rounds in the elite, Long Island, New York, community, consulting friends, donors, financiers and business executives about economic issues, the New York Times reports. Among the topics of discussion, according to the Times, were President Barack Obama's quest to eliminate corporate inversions that allow companies to take advantage of lower tax rates by reincorporating abroad and 'how to tackle income inequality without alienating businesses or castigating the wealthy.' Scroll down for video . Hillary Clinton, pictured here at the 37th Harkin Steak Fry on Saturday in Indianola, Iowa, spent her summer vacation asking friends, donors, business executives and financiers about their views on jobs and the economy . Clinton has tripped over questions about her own financial means on multiple occasions this summer since embarking on her Hard Choices book tour, which is considered by many as a dry run for her upcoming presidential campaign. The former first lady infamously told ABC News in June that she and husband Bill were 'dead broke' when they left the White House. While the statement was 'accurate,' as Clinton has since argued, it set off a media firestorm, nonetheless. The Clintons quickly became multimillionaires after moving out of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and  have an estimated net worth of as much as $100 million. The Clinton's often charge $200,000 or more for public speaking engagements, and they've made a combined sum of more than $22 million off the sales of their memoirs. Dubbed the first gaffe of the 2016 presidential campaign, the Clintons have been trying to find a more articulate way to address the issue of wealth inequality in America ever since Hillary's interview on ABC. A source close to Clinton told the Times the former Secretary of State regularly seeks out the opinion of her friends on policy issues, and her behavior over her summer holiday does not necessarily mean she's running for president. But the Times talked to a number of other Hampton vacationers who said that 'amid the small talk, Mrs. Clinton would offer telltale signs that she intends to run.' Hillary and husband Bill were the perfect political couple last weekend at retiring Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin's annual steak fry fundraiser . Hillary Clinton admitted on Saturday that she's 'thinking about' running for president again in 2016 but told attendees of the steak fry 'that's not why I'm here.' Clinton was officially at the event to wish her former Senate colleague Harkin, right, a fond farewell . In preparation for a potential candidacy, the Times claims Clinton is readying her body and mind for the rigors of a presidential campaign by practicing yoga. Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill laughed off the Times' suggestion that Clinton's fitness regimen is related in any way to her presidential ambitions. 'You caught us,' Merrill told the the Times in an email. 'These are all definitive signs of a person...simply living their life.' Clinton has sent no clearer signal about her future plans since the start of her book tour than her visit to Iowa last weekend for retiring Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin's annual steak fry fundraiser. Long a political tradition in Iowa, the Harkin Steak Fry attracts aspiring presidential candidates looking to make in-roads in the all important primary state. Despite having competed for president a joint total of three times in the past, the Clintons' intricate political operation have never been on firm footing in Iowa. Bill Clinton passed over Iowa when he sought the Democratic nomination in 1992 as Harkin, Iowa's favorite son, was also a presidential contender that year. When it came time for Clinton to run for re-election, he focused his time on traditional battleground states. Hillary Clinton considered skipping over the state, too, during her own campaign in 2008 in favor of focusing her time and money on states she had a better chance of winning, but ended up having to go all-in after a campaign memo outlining her strategy leaked. Though Clinton won the coveted endorsement of the Des Moines Register that year, she lost the state's caucus to eventual Democratic presidential nominee, and later president, Barack Obama. Saturday's trip to Indianola, Iowa, was Hillary's first visit to the state since 2007. At the event Clinton acknowledged that she was 'thinking about' reentering politics before telling the audience 'but for today, that’s not why I’m here.' Instead, she spent her speech at the fundraiser, which doubled as a farewell for her former colleague Harkin, stumping for Democratic candidates in Iowa. Harkin in turned praised Clinton at the event and attributed her previous bad luck in the state to the 'phenomenon' that was Barack Obama's 2008 campaign. However, he conceded to ABC News' Jonathan Karl in an interview curated on The Weekly Standard that Clinton needs to hone her message if she opts to participate in the 2016 contest. Asked by Karl if he thought Clinton was 'too hawkish on foreign policy' for progressives and 'too moderate on economic issues, Harkin said: 'I think this is something that will be developed and we'll find out when -- if when and if she decides to run, you know, what's her vision for America?'","Clinton asked banking and business executives 'how to tackle income inequality without alienating businesses or castigating the wealthy'

"It's the original free love community where women rule the roost: Welcome to the gorgeous Trobriand Islands in the South Pacific where the ladies can have as many lovers as they please and marriages are sealed with a gift of yams and polished stone. And as you'd expect from a place where free love rules the roost, conflicts on the islands, which are officially part of Papua New Guinea, are settled over marathon games of cricket in which even girls can take part. But, as photographer Eric Lafforgue reveals, their easygoing attitude to sex has come at a price. 'Trobiand Islanders have a relaxed approach to sex before and even after marriage,' he explains. 'Girls learn about contraception very early and virginity has no value at all. Carrying cash: Along with yams, dried banana leaves are currency on the island. According to Lafforgue, this little girl's leaves are the equivalent of a bundle of £10 notes . Chief: Mr Tolobuwa is the head of Vaikiki village and always carries betel nuts, lime gourds and spatulas. The spatula is made from bird bone but human used to be used . Customs: Little girls always wear garlands of fresh flowers on their heads while right, a widow, distinguishable by her shaved head, smiles for Lafforgue's camera . 'If a girl . gets pregnant, her family keeps the baby, because, according to the local . custom, men just help to open up the woman to pregnancy - the real . father is a Baloma or spirit.' Although more and more islanders are attending school, attitudes to sex remain the same. 'Western education changed some islander's point of view, but not all of them,' explains Lafforgue. 'Relationships between married couples don't have much in common with what happens in Europe: here [in the Trobriand Islands] a man is supposed to give . presents to his wife in return for the sexual favours.' Unfortunately, . the Trobiand Islanders relaxed approach to sex and relationships has . left them vulnerable to HIV and AIDS - a disease which is known to locals as . 'the sickness without medicine' and has ravaged some communities. But, says Lafforgue, even the malign presence of the disease isn't . enough to persuade the islanders to give up their traditional . way of life. Traditional: Trobriand Islanders wear red grass skirts unique to the islands for ceremonies and weddings. Completing the look are traditional feathered headbands . In charge: Girls are encouraged to take part in 'battles' and dance topless, with most choosing to wear red grass skirts, shells, feathers and fresh flowers . Elaborate: The skirts worn by the women are made from dried grass, while necklaces and bracelets are made from shells. Men wear cockatoo feather headdresses . Permissive: Trobriand teenagers are encouraged to experiment with different lovers and a special hut, right, is set aside in every village for them to use . 'Despite the fact that HIV and AIDS spreads quickly through the island population, premarital sex remains a part of the islanders’ idyllic lifestyle,' continues Lafforgue. All villages are home to a special hut called a bukumatula which is set aside especially for unmarried teenagers and their lovers, although condoms and other types of contraceptive are nowhere to be found. There is, however, one sort of person to whom the Trobriand Islanders' amorous behaviour doesn't apply. 'The romantic customs of the Trobriand Islanders do not extend to ""outsiders"",' explains Lafforgue. 'The locals are very proud people and they value their genetic lines.' Discovered by the West in 1793, the islands were named after Denis de Trobriand, a lieutenant on the French ship, Espérance, but remained untouched until a Methodist missionary moved in in 1894. He was followed in the 1930s by a Catholic Mission but the islanders, although ruled by first the British and then the Australians, clung firm to their traditional ways. Education: Despite the influence of Christian teachers, the majority of Trobriand Islanders continue to take a relaxed approach to sex and relationships . Chief's . family: The house of the chieftain is recognisable by its height, shell . decorations and the presence of a malagan - a carved, painted totem . pole . Changing times: Although some modern items such as musical instruments have been embraced, islanders cling to many traditions, including keeping pigs as pets . Is . that a googly? Cricket is hugely popular and was introduced by colonial . authorities. Banned from going to war, the islanders settle their . differences with a game . Home . sweet home: In Obweria village, the many thatched huts are built on . stilts around a central square, which is known to locals as the Buka . Now part of Papua New Guinea, the Trobrianders continue to live much as they always have, using yams as currency and operating a matriarchal system that sees children become part of their mother's clan rather than the other way around. They also settle scores and disputes by playing cricket, which was introduced by colonial authorities after they banned tribes from going to war with each other. 'A cricket game is always the occasion for mocking remarks and challenges between villages. It is played with much whistle blowing, singing and dancing,' explains Lafforgue. 'Girls also take part in these ""battles"" and dance topless, only wearing grass skirts and flowers. They also adopt very suggestive poses, which would  probably come as a shock to the authorities who introduced it. 'Dances always take place after lengthy reconciliation ceremonies, with those taking part putting a mixture of coconut oil, mint and lemongrass on their bodies.' He adds: 'I was invited to join the circle of dancers who then took a sadistic pleasure in making fun of my hairy legs. I had no hope with the girls here because they don’t like white skin and hair — it's something they see as a sign of ugliness and scruffiness. The dim dim (the white man) is not their beauty ideal.' Magic: Although many, among them seven-year-old Salome, go to school, the Trobriand Islanders continue to believe in magic and believe it is responsible for conception . Important: . Because yams are a sign of wealth, yam houses - huts where the tubers . are stored - are very important. Those belonging to chiefs are highly . decorated . Delicate: Teenage girls wear tortoiseshell earrings which they eventually pass on to their daughters, while traditional kula boats come covered in cowrie shells . Jewellery: Most of the Trobriand Islanders sport elaborate bracelets and necklaces, all of which are made from natural materials such as shells, stones and feathers . Rare: Because the islands are coral atolls, anything made from stone is considered rare and valuable. This stone was polished and given as a wedding gift . Excitement: . The weekly flight from Port Moresby, capital of Papua New Guinea, is . the most exciting moment of the week for many and draws huge crowds . War: . During World War II, thousands of American soldiers were stationed on . the Trobriand Islands. Vintage dog tags can be picked up for as little . as 20p . Remote: . The idyllic islands are home to the Trobriand Islanders, who still live . in much the same way as they always have - including fishing from . wooden canoes . Paradise: The remote Trobriand Islands are a tiny knot of coral atolls surrounded by the Solomon Sea and just off the east coast of Papua New Guinea .","The Trobriand Islands are in the Solomon Sea and are officially a part of Papua New Guinea .
Islanders have an easygoing attitude to sex and encourage both men and women to take lovers .
Most villages have a special hut called a bukumatula which is used for extramarital encounters .
Babies are thought to be the result of magic with no link between sex and pregnancy .

"A father has accused police of using excessive force on his ten-year-old son when they handcuffed him and placed him face down on the trunk of their patrol car. Moses Maldonado of Kissimmee, Florida, posted a picture online of his son on the squad car after cops were called to his school. Staff say he was trying to hurt himself with a pair of scissors and making threats, according to Fox. Accused of excessive force: A father is angry that police handcuffed his 10-year-old autistic son and put him the trunk of their squad car when he threatened to harm himself at his school in Florida . But his father claims the police acted too aggressively when they carried the boy kicking and screaming from the classroom and detained him on top of the car. He says his son is scared to go back to school and has heat rash and bruises from his treatment by the cops, according to WFTV. He told Fox: 'Right now, my son is terrified of cops. What will happen in the future? Will my son be able to trust an officer? No, he's not. He's going to look at a cop and right away think he's going to get arrested.' The police department says officers acted appropriately and tried to talk Maldono's son down first - but when he would not cooperate and threatened to cut his own fingers off they intervened more forcefully. Outraged: Moses Maldonado says his son is now afraid of police officers after the ordeal . A spokesman said the child was put on the trunk of the car because the asphalt was too hot and pointed out that the boy was not arrested, merely detained for his own safety. But Maldono claims they should have let him deal with the situation when he arrived at the school. 'They didn't let me go to the classroom to help my son out. I'm his father. I can help him out. I can deal with the situation better than anybody else can,' he told Fox. 'He's an autistic kid. They say things they don't mean, out of context, it's a touchy situation.' A Kissimmee Police spokeswoman said: 'We train for this type of thing through crisis intervention training, it has a component with dealing with children with disabilities obviously we're going to train some more but the chief stands behind the officers decisions to go ahead and subdue the child, .","Cops manhandled the boy after he threatened to harm himself at school in Florida .

"Andrew Flintoff, nicknamed Freddie for cartoon character Fred Flintstone, said it was wife Rachael who helped him get over the eating disorder . On the cricket field, Andrew Flintoff was a swashbuckling force of nature. But the former England captain has spoken of how he was secretly battling bulimia – and might never have recovered without his wife’s support. The sportsman, nicknamed Freddie for cartoon character Fred Flintstone, said it was wife Rachael who helped him get over the eating disorder. As a young man, poor diet and heavy drinking saw his weight soar to 17st 12lb. Speaking to Piers Morgan for his Life Stories TV series, he pointed to a newspaper article from 2000 stating that he was heavier than the boxer Lennox Lewis. The 36-year-old, said: ‘I did [get upset] but I thought I couldn’t really tell anyone because in the world I was in … you want to come away as being almost bulletproof.’ It is the first time he has spoken in depth about his cycle of bingeing and making himself sick – even during international matches. Flintoff, who shed two stone during his illness, said: ‘Everyone was happy with me, I’d gone from that fat fella you saw making his Test debut to getting into some sort of shape. 'I was doing it a lot. I was doing it at lunchtime, I would come off and have something to eat and go and bowl again. ‘I was cautious, you’d see if anyone was in the toilets with you and you’d find somewhere to go.’ He recalled a talk given to the England squad by a dietician: ‘She started saying … she dealt with models, actors, athletes who have had eating disorders. I thought, “Oh, I can have a chat with her after this,” and then she said, “But I can’t imagine there’s any of that in here,” and I thought, “I can’t tell her now, jeez”.’ Flintoff said he could not have recovered without Rachael, 36, who he met in 2002. That year marked a turning point in which he found his form and hit his maiden Test century after being criticised for inconsistency. He said it was ‘no coincidence’, adding: ‘Professionally, I don’t think I could have done all the things I’ve done without her. She’s always there.’ They married in 2005. Having retired in 2010 due to injury, he has this year returned to cricket, playing for Lancashire. The 36-year-old, who made a return to professional cricket last month, said: ‘I did [get upset] but I thought I couldn’t really tell anyone because in the world I was in'","Former England captain said wife Rachel helped him get over eating disorder .

"The red squirrel is a British native but the little animal is quickly becoming a rare sight in our gardens. Only five per cent of Britons have ever spotted a red squirrel outside their home, a new wildlife survey has found. And only 2.7 per cent said they see a red squirrel on a monthly basis. A fifth of Britons have never spotted a squirrel in their back garden, a wildlife survey by RSPB revealed . The results also found that you would be more likely to spot a squirrel living in rural Scotland - a stronghold for the species but those living in the Midlands have less than a one per cent chance of seeing the animal. The figures were released after 274,000 homeowners took part in the RSPB's Big Garden Birdwatch survey. The project has tracked . garden birds every year since 1976 - but this is the first time the RSPB . has asked participants about other wildlife. The map shows the distribution of squirrels across the UK. In 2010, red and grey squirrels no longer populate the east of England. The map also illustrates that the red squirrel population has continued to grow in Scotland . RSPB conservation scientist Dr Daniel Hayhow described the figures as 'shocking'. He said: 'We all know that red squirrels have been threatened for a long time, but these figures are quite shocking.' The comment came after the survey found that invasive American grey squirrels are seen in 90 per cent of gardens. The number of red squirrels has dwindled after the species was hit by a pox virus, carried by the grey squirrel. The red squirrel also requires more dense woodland than the grey. The map shows that red squirrels were prevalent across the UK in 1945 . A hedgehog snuffling up to the back door was also once a common sight - but it is rapidly becoming a thing of the past. One in five people have never seen hedgehogs in their gardens, the survey found. The startling figures confirm conservationists' fears - that the small British mammal is suffering a huge decline. Scientists think there are now fewer than a million hedgehogs in the UK, a 30 per cent fall since 2003. The survey found that 21 per cent of people never see hedgehogs at all, and only 28 per cent spot them more than once a month. Two thirds of participants never see badgers, a quarter never see common toads and 93 per cent never see red squirrels. Daniel Hayhow, RSPB conservation scientist, said the survey showed how important gardens were for wildlife. He added: 'It is a big concern that so many people never see hedgehogs, a species that is so familiar to us. 'The fact that they are not seen regularly even in rural gardens is quite troubling. 'This is the first time we have included wider species in our annual survey. The results provide a baseline for us to monitor how hedgehogs do over the next few years.' The reasons behind hedgehogs' decline are unclear, but ecologists think the loss of the woodlands and hedgerows where they live, the building of new roads and houses, and the fragmentation of the countryside could all be to blame. The common frog leaped into first place as the most abundant garden amphibian - with half of people in the UK recording that they saw one at least monthly, regardless of whether they lived in a rural, suburban or urban area. Part of the reason behind the decline of the red squirrel has been put . down to a deadly virus carried by the grey squirrel. RSPB scientist . Daniel Hayhow described the five per cent figure as 'shocking' A wildlife expert said: 'The fact that they are not seen regularly even in rural gardens is quite troubling' In contrast, toads were seen by only 28 per cent of people monthly and numbers have declined, especially in central and southern England. The creatures are more likely to be seen in gardens in rural areas, where 41 per cent of householders recording that they saw toads on a monthly basis. Animal charities are trying to encourage people to provide space for wildlife in their gardens, whether by building a hedgehog box, putting up bird feeder, or finding a space for a pond. David Wembridge, of the People's Trust for Endangered Species, said: 'We know that only a minority of gardens are regularly used by hedgehogs - one species we're particularly concerned about. 'With numbers falling in the wider countryside, doing more to encourage hedgehogs into the green spaces around our homes and places of work could make a big difference.' Worrying: Two thirds of participants never see badgers, while a quarter claimed they never see common toads . The Cornwall Red Squirrel Project is one of many initiatives in the UK that aims to reintroduce the native red squirrel. The last native red squirrel was seen in the county in 1984. But as Cornwall has large areas of mixed woodland and valleys, it is an ideal habitat for red squirrels. In 2009, the project was founded and began with a cull of grey squirrels. This will be followed by the reintroductions of red squirrels to The Lizard and West Penwith. Surrounded by the sea on both sides, these areas are more easily defended from re-population by grey squirrels. At the same time, a cull of grey squirrels was carried out in the area to give the red squirrels a chance to reclaim their habitat. Removing grey squirrels also allowed trees and woodland to grow back - the grey squirrels strip the bark from the stems of trees, causing huge damage to biodiversity. The project is supported by the Red Squirrel Survival Trust, whose patron is HRH The Prince of Wales, and the Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust.","Just three per cent of people see red squirrel on a monthly basis .

And the younger Nicholson hasn’t only overtaken his father in terms of looks, career-wise too, he is ahead of the curve.

"The father of the Italian woman ordered by British judges to give up her baby after a forced caesarean has backed the court’s decision to put the child up for adoption. Marino Pacchieri said his daughter Alessandra is a ‘threat’ to the baby because she experiences ‘manic, paranoid delusions’. He added that his daughter, who suffers from bipolar disorder, frequently defies doctors by refusing to take her medication. 'She's a threat': Marino Pacchieri has backed the court's decision to put his daughter's baby up for adoption . ‘It may seem harsh,’ Mr Pacchieri said, ‘but I do not believe my daughter should be allowed to keep  the baby.’ The child, now 15 months old and who cannot be named for legal reasons, is in care in the UK on the orders of a judge in the notoriously secretive Court of Protection. The case has sparked a wave of anger with MPs condemning the treatment of Alessandra, 35, as totalitarian. But speaking last night, Mr Pacchieri, 73, said: ‘At the time I did question whether the British authorities were being heavy-handed, but knowing Alessandra like I do, I believe they were acting in her best interests. ‘At that point she had stopped taking her medication and was extremely agitated. She was not mentally well enough to take care of her baby. Together: Alessandra Pacchieri, who suffers from bipolar disorder, is pictured with her child in England . ‘My worry is that if she is given custody and stops taking her medication again, as she has done countless times, she will become a threat to the child. ‘I see Alessandra most days and I have asked her, “How can you cope as a mother? You already have two children who are looked after by your mother so how can you care for  a third?’’ ’ Mr Pacchieri said his daughter began suffering from bipolar disorder after moving in 2001 to Los Angeles to work as a waitress. ‘Within three months she had married and fallen pregnant. It was around that time that her behaviour became very strange. ‘I visited Alessandra five or six times while she was in America and I was shocked by what I found. ‘It was as if she was two people, one minute normal and fine, the next paranoid and talking about how people were spying on her. ‘She became obsessed with keys and would steal them from friends, family, whoever. All over her house she had drawers full of keys. ‘She was always very paranoid about losing her own keys. She would lose them all the time but would think people were stealing them. ‘It began to affect her work and she started going into the restaurant dressed in increasingly bizarre outfits. Her manager became frustrated with her and urged her to seek help. Her response was just to get angry and in the end she had to let her go.’ Mr Pacchieri said that Alessandra separated from the father of her child in 2004 and the child was adopted by the father’s sister in America. Alessandra finally sought help  from a doctor in 2007 and was given medication that helped with her erratic moods. However, once it started to work, her father said, she believed she didn’t need it any more and stopped. ‘Her symptoms flared up again and in 2008 her mother Pini and I had become so worried that we begged her to come home to Italy so we could take care of her and she agreed. Outrage: How the story was reported in the Mail on Sunday last week . Close family: Miss Pacchieri is pictured with her eldest child, father Marino and mother Pini in the US in 2004 . ‘She came to stay with me and I convinced her to go to see a doctor at hospital. The doctor told her that she would benefit from a stay at the  psychiatric ward.’ She was discharged after a week’s stay in Montepulciano Hospital near Siena with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Mr Pacchieri said she applied to have her child returned from America in 2008. The application was granted on the grounds her daughter would live with Alessandra’s mother, who is divorced from her father. He said: ‘Alessandra was receiving the right treatment and started to get things back together but wanted to go back to America to meet an old boyfriend. She went in 2009 and came back a few months later pregnant with his child.’ Alessandra stopped taking her medication in case it harmed the unborn baby and became unwell again. She was admitted to a psychiatric clinic in Tuscany. Her father said: ‘She was discharged and came to stay with me to give birth to her second daughter. Social services made a court order and the second baby also went to live with her mother. She was very angry and accused us of stealing  her children, but it was a decision made by a court and for her best interests.’ But after this, Alessandra went back on her medication, held down a job at a hotel and was seeing her children every day. Then in 2012 she met a Senegalese man in a Florence nightclub who said he was a basketball player. They had a fling and she became pregnant. Again, she stopped taking her medication. In June that year, and at four months pregnant, she travelled to England for a training course to become a stewardess for Ryanair. She stayed at the Hilton Hotel, Stansted, but ran short of money to pay the bills. She suffered a panic attack and rang the police for help. She gave them her mother’s number in Italy, who informed them her daughter was bipolar. Order: The child, now 15 months old, is in care on the orders of a judge in the  secretive Court of Protection . Alessandra claims the police told her they would take her to hospital to check on the baby, but she was seen by two psychiatrists and on June 13 last year was sectioned under the Mental Health Act. In a closed hearing, the local health trust made an application to the Court of Protection on August 23 and were granted permission by Mr Justice Mostyn to perform a caesarean without her consent. The judge ruled it was in the mother’s best interests and she was too mentally ill to make the decision herself. The following day Essex Social Services applied for a temporary care order and the newborn baby was taken away. Mr Pacchieri found out what had happened and Alessandra was flown back to Italy, accompanied by British social workers. Ruling: Following Miss Pacchieri's unsuccessful appeal, Essex County Council, pictured, obtained permission to place her child for adoption . He said: ‘I met them at the airport. The social services asked whether I or Pini would take the baby, but I am too old and Pini is already looking after Alessandra’s other two children. ‘The authorities even went to ask the father in Florence if he would take care of the child but he is an illegal immigrant with no job so was not a suitable father.’ Again, Alessandra began taking her medication and she was well enough to get a job caring for  an elderly couple near where her mother lives with her daughters, now aged 11 and four, in Chianciano. In February, judge Roderick Newton began the adoption process at Chelmsford County Court. In May, Alessandra applied through the Italian courts for  custody of the child, but the court ruled that the baby must remain in England. She challenged the decision in October at Ipswich County Court but her appeal failed and Essex County Council obtained permission to place the child for adoption. The case came to light this week, and following international outrage Britain’s senior family judge Sir James Munby has demanded to oversee further hearings. Last night, Alessandra’s Italian lawyer Stefano Oliver said he would lodge an appeal. Alessandra, who is allowed to visit the child during her visits to England for hearings, has said she is committed to her medication and would like the child to be returned to a foster home in Italy so she can prove she is a responsible mother. She said: ‘I may have had three children by three different fathers, but it does not mean I am not a good and caring mother. I have never done anything to hurt my other two daughters and I never would.’ A spokesman for Essex County Council said: ‘The long-term safety and wellbeing of children is always our priority.’ 'Horrified': Teresa Cooper, 46, has revealed that she was given an abortion without her consent . A British woman has revealed that she was given an abortion without her consent – and said she was ‘horrified’ by how authorities still deal with distressed women. Teresa Cooper, 46, a mother  of three, received £27,500 in compensation after the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow, Essex, carried out an abortion on her unborn baby boy without proper consent in November 2003. Now the furore over Alessandra Pacchieri’s case has brought back the nightmare of her experience. ‘When I read about what happened to this Italian woman I lay down on my bed and cried,’ she said. ‘It was almost the tenth anniversary of when my baby boy  – whom I had named Tristan – was killed and it brought back the horror of what was done to me. ‘This country needs to look at the way hospitals treat women who are distressed. 'Too often they brand them as seriously mentally ill, in my view to cover up the appalling shortcomings in the system and  the way they deal with them.’ In Ms Cooper’s case, the health trust admitted that she had not received adequate counselling and that the procedure had gone ahead without confirmation of her consent or consultation with a surgeon. Ms Cooper, of Ongar, Essex, was 36 when she fell pregnant to her fiance in 2003. It was planned, but she had ‘reluctantly’ signed the consent form for an abortion after repeated bleeding left her fearful for the health of her baby, and  her own welfare. Two days before the procedure she watched a ProLife video and decided she would not have the abortion before seeking another opinion from the doctor. Instead she was sedated and the abortion went ahead without any attempt to get confirmation from her that she consented. At the time of the compensation award a trust spokesman apologised for ‘shortcomings in care’.","Alessandra Pacchieri's baby was taken into care from forced caesarean birth .

"It can take considerable willpower and determination to give up the booze for a year. But, naturally, Carol Vorderman has it all figured out. The 53-year-old, who came to fame doing the numbers game on Countdown for 26 years, yesterday showed off what a success her alcohol ban has been. Appearing at the Lord of The Dance gala night on Wednesday she displayed her new slimline figure in a red lace dress and a thinner, smoother face. Scroll down for video . Carol Vorderman, who came to fame doing the numbers game on Countdown for 26 years, yesterday showed off what a success her alcohol ban has been . At the end of last year, Miss Vorderman, vowed to give up alcohol in a bid to drop back down to a size 10 as she prepares for a solo flight round the world. She said at the time: ‘I have decided that I am giving up alcohol for the whole year. I gave it up from December 29 as I thought I wanted to drink next New Year’s Eve. 'Last year I probably put on a stone or so, not that I weigh myself. I just want to be healthy.’ Miss Vorderman pictured before the alcohol ban in October 2012. Miss Vorderman vowed to give up alcohol in a bid to drop back down to a size 10 as she prepares for a solo flight round the world . According to Sioned Quirke, spokesman for the British Dietetic Association, it is no surprise that cutting out alcohol has been so effective in helping Miss Vorderman lose weight – alcohol is high in calories and by cutting it out Miss Vorderman has created a calorie deficit. The twice-divorced Miss Vorderman, who is currently dating former Red Arrows Squadron Leader Graham Duff , 39, has lost the weight in time for a demanding few months as, having qualified as a pilot last year, she is preparing to fly around the world solo. Last night a spokesman for Miss Vorderman did not respond to a request for a comment. Cutting out alcohol is an almost guaranteed method of losing weight, according to The Association of British Dieticians (BDA). As . Miss Vorderman’s svelte figure testifies, a dry lifestyle can help . shift the pounds quickly and, says Sioned Quirke a spokesman for the . BDA, it’s easy to understand way. She . said: ‘It’s a simple calorie deficit because alcohol tends to be very . high in calories. So, depending on what exactly it drinks, it can . significantly contribute to your daily calorie intake. ‘So . a lot of people, if they go out on a Friday or Saturday night, can . easily drink their way through a day’s worth of calories. If somebody . wants to cut down or cut out alcohol, it would have a big impact on . their weight.’ A key problem . with alcohol is that is provides ‘empty calories’ void of nutrients . but, Mrs Quirke explains, by cutting down drinking, a person makes room . for nutrient rich calories. However, . she is keen to stress that while reducing alcohol intake is a ‘great . first step’, for people who are battling with their weight there are . often other issues to deal with. She . said: ‘It depends what the problem was in the first place, for the . majority of people who are overweight, it’s not just one thing causing . that. It’s often a combination of alcohol, portion sizes and food . choice. ‘Cutting down on . alcohol is a great first step, we know for a fact that it will help you . lose weight depending on how much you cut down.’","Displayed her new slimline figure at the Lord of The Dance gala night .

"TACKLE KEOWN SPECIAL: What it was like to be Invincible . When Arsenal were Invincible - a recollection of an unbeatable team . It's 10 years since Arsenal's spectacular unbeaten 49 matches  in the Premier League came to a close and when Graham Poll, who was at the top of his game for over 25 years, took charge of high profile fixtures across the globe. Having seen many of the world's finest players in action, former referee Graham Poll was lucky enough to officiate during the era when Arsene Wenger guided the Arsenal 'Invincibles'. Here's his take on members of that record breaking run... Graham Poll referees a fiesty clash between Arsenal and Manchester United during the 'Invincibles' era . Having refereed six of 'The Invincibles' 49-match unbeaten run, including the last one they won, I got to know how close the team worked and it was that incredible team spirit and total belief in one another that enabled their fine run. Poll, having a word with keeper Jens Lehmann, knew the opposition would play on the German's temperament . JENS LEHMANN . Whenever you refereed Arsenal against Bolton you knew it would be a battle. Sam Allardyce played on the big German's fragile temperament and put Kevin Nolan on him, literally, at set pieces. In December 2003 I was aware of the ill feeling between the two sides when Nolan kept chipping away at me telling me that I shouldn't give Arsenal anything as he knew they didn't like me. Fortunately I ignored his advice when pulling him up for treading on Lehmann's toes at a corner. Penalising that kept Lehmann in the right mood. Defender Sol Campbell, celebrating a goal for the Gunners, made Poll doubt his own decision during a match . SOL CAMPBELL . Campbell was a very level headed footballer who said very little to me or any referees. I must have really tested this when giving a penalty against him for a foul on Alan Shearer late into a game Arsenal were already losing 2-1. Campbell just looked at me astonished and shook his head. That had more effect on me than him screaming in my face. I knew I'd got the decision wrong. Left back Ashley Cole was an integral part of Arsenal's rock solid defence but was never short of a word . ASHLEY COLE . Cole was perhaps the opposite of Campbell; never slow to tell you how you'd made a mistake or how bad you were. His comments were usually laced with abuse but issued in such a way that left you wondering if he meant to offend or was just not very bright. Dutchman Dennis Bergkamp, celebrating for the Gunners, was a pain to referee says Poll . DENNIS BERGKAMP . An absolute genius on the ball but the Dutchman could be a real pain for referees. A couple of seasons earlier I remember calling then skipper Tony Adams to me and asking him to help me shut Bergkamp up. 'Just book him, we think he's a pain as well,' Adams advised me with a smile. Robert Pires, who scored four times in Poll's six 'Invincibles' games, asked the referee to call him Bobby . ROBERT PIRES . A French gentleman who was polite, calm and friendly to deal with, telling me to 'Call me Bobby'. Pires scored four times in those six games, the goal at the Reebok was an absolute cracker. It was the French connection, with Arsene Wenger's influence, which led to an embarrassing incident for me. In Cesc Fabregas' first season he was down injured and I approached him to ask, 'Ca va?' Fabregas replied, 'I'm fine and SPANISH!' Poll says Gilberto Silva was a gifted player but was left frustrated when he missed a penalty at Old Trafford . GILBERTO SILVA . Another gifted player who was never in the face of referees but disappointed me in one game when he failed to convert a penalty at Old Trafford. Referees are accused of not giving penalties to away teams at Manchester United so when we do you could at least score. Highly influential winger Freddie Ljungberg knew exactly how to wind up the opposition, according to Poll . FREDDIE LJUNGBERG . Another gifted wide player who had the ability to get under the skin of opponents by winding them up. I remember sending Mikael Silvestre off when playing for Manchester United at Highbury after being tormented by Ljungberg time and again, he resorted to butting the Swede. Alex Ferguson was livid and as Silvestre approached him leaving the field demanded to know what he was supposed to have done. 'Sorry boss, he p***** me off so I nutted him' came the honest appraisal. Ljungberg's job was done. Arsenal legend Thierry Henry (right) was the best centre forward to play in the Premier League says Poll . THIERRY HENRY . The best centre forward ever to play in the Premier League, perhaps down to his speed of thought as much as his pace over the turf. I remember allowing the Frenchman to take a quick free-kick against Chelsea which went straight into the unguarded corner of the net – he saw the opportunity and asked permission which I gave him. Two years later I made him wait for the wall to go back at Wigan and after I blew my whistle he just lifted the all up and over the wall and bent it into the top left corner for a wonderful goal. Nothing seemed beyond him except recognising referees! After one defeat at Highbury, Henry went absolutely ballistic trying to get to me to blame me for the defeat. 'You cost us in the Cup final and now tonight it's enough!' Unfortunately I never refereed Arsenal in a Cup final so clearly players are guilty of mistaken identity as well as referees. Former Arsenal captain Patrick Vieira was part of the tunnel clash with Roy Keane, which Poll oversaw . PATRICK VIEIRA . The hard man of the team but a real Jekyll and Hyde character; tough as nails on the pitch, considered and polite off it. There was of course the infamous tunnel clash with Roy Keane which I oversaw which stands out but by then we had established a mutually respectful relationship. Building that was difficult as Vieira's combative tackling was always going to cause issues with referees and I sent him off twice, both for second yellow cards. Some players adjusted their style when on a yellow but not Vieira. He knew one way and that was uncompromising and hard. Two off field incidents spring to mind; the day after the tunnel incident I bumped into Vieira in the British Airways lounge at Heathrow. We chatted for a few minutes about the previous evening's game and Vieira said he felt they lost the game by winding-up United and Keane in particular. I then refereed Vieira in a Champions League game in Turin when he was at Juventus and he took the time and trouble to pop into my dressing room after the game to thank us and tell us how much he missed English refereeing – interesting given his style of play. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, still at the helm in north London, won his third Premier League title in 2004 . ARSENE WENGER . Tactically superb but temperamental. Wenger often used the tactic of planting a seed of doubt in a referee's mind at half-time when throwing a comment at you in the tunnel about what you were failing to see. Hard as you would try you found yourself looking for that early in the second-half so the tactic worked. My most stark memory was after a League Cup semi-final defeat in which I cautioned lots and dismissed Vieira, Wenger made it clear how disappointed he was with my officiating. I offered to visit him at the training ground and go through the DVD with him and the team to help them see why I had done what I had. He declined saying that he didn't want his team to change their approach by considering a referee's decisions. His conviction was absolute and his belief unwavering then as it is now – hence why he has seen so many red cards for his players.","It's the 10-year anniversary of Arsenal's final win in their unbeaten run .

"A Victorian chicken farmer who battled local council bureaucracy for five years says he hopes the multimillion dollar film being made about his life will inspire others 'to take no nonsense'. Allan Marsh, better known as Swampy in his local community, helped the decimated Little Penguins of Middle Island, off the coast of Warrnambool in south-west Victoria, survive after his faithful maremma dog Oddball began protecting them in 2006. His unusual idea - to use the Italian sheepdogs to protect the local penguins from red foxes - has now been acclaimed by conservationists and the 'wildlife worriers' he once fought so hard against. 'The weird thing about the movie is that it might inspire someone out there to say ""I've got a good idea and I’m not going to back down"",' he told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Allan Marsh, known as Swampy in his local community, helped the decimated Little Penguins of Middle Island, survive after his faithful maremma dog Oddball began protecting them in 2006 . Swampy first realised the protective nature of the white maremma dogs when David Williams, a university science student working on his farm, recommended he get one to protect his chooks from the red foxes. He had the idea of using the dogs to protect the threatened Little Penguins after a newspaper article exposed how they were being killed in their hundreds. In 2004, 234 were killed by red foxes. In 2004-2005 only four penguins were left on the island, Deakin University reported. Swampy said to Dave: 'I reckon these dogs would do the job.' Coincidentally Dave’s father Stanley was a wildlife officer with the Victorian Department of Environment and Sustainability and supported Swampy’s idea… but then came the first hurdle. Warrnambool City Council told them dogs were not allowed on Middle Island. The chicken farmer first realised the protective nature of the white maremma dogs when David Williams, a university science student working on his farm, recommended he get one to protect his chooks from red foxes . The successful idea then inspired Swampy to suggest using the dogs to protect the threatened Little Penguins after it was reported they were being killed in their hundreds and their numbers were dwindling . Swampy explained how they had to wait until someone new started working at the council before they could take their battle against the people he calls ‘wildlife worriers’ any further. That person turned out to be Ian Fitzgibbon and his boss Neil Allen. ‘We nicknamed Neil Allen the toe cutter as he had everyone jumping when he said something,’ Swampy laughed. In the forthcoming film, starring actor Shane Jacobson as the chook farmer, Swampy said a male dog called Meeeko will play Oddball. The dog is the real life Oddball’s grandson. Oddball is a retired 14-year-old bitch who Swampy bred on his farm. ‘She was the first one to go out on the island to protect the penguins,’ he explained. ‘She was the one to go because all the authorities were terrified the dogs were going to bite someone and they just wanted a nice easy going one out there,’ he said. Middle Island in Warrnambool, Victoria, is cut off from land when the swell is up but during some months of the year red foxes can access it . Oddball originally went to the island for three weeks but she got ‘lonely and swam home’. Then her aunt Missy was sent out there but she also swam home. ‘They aren’t used to being by themselves, they are used to being with a pack,’ Swampy explained. He finally managed to get the authorities to see that they needed two dogs out there for it to work so they didn’t get lonely. ‘When it finally started to happen it was after five-years that we'd been working on it… but the principal is ridiculously simple,’ Swampy said. ‘The wildlife worriers don’t understand dogs. They don’t have real ones themselves, they might have little yappy things. ‘They don’t understand how their territory works. That’s why dogs attack the postman. Maremmas have an exceptionally strong sense of territory,’ he reasoned. At first, Warrnambool City Council said dogs were not allowed on Middle Island. However the idea was eventually approved by Ian Fitzgibbon when he joined the council team . The Middle Island Little Penguins breed on the land and live in burrows dug out in the sand, soil or man-made structures. The maremmas are light-footed and do not disturb their nests . Swampy said the maremmas aren’t particularly fussed about the penguins, instead they are guarding the territory on the island. ‘They are cohabiting, they don’t bond with them they put up with them,’ he laughed. ‘When a fox tries to invade their territory then they’ve got an argument on their hands. That argument initially starts of as a lot of barking and they bite. They have a good set of teeth.' Despite now being retired, Swampy said ‘Oddy killed a fox 12 months ago … she’s still capable of taking on a fox.’ Swampy had no idea a film would be made about his life but explained Jacobson’s flick is just the latest media attention he’s received over the years. When Oddball first started saving the penguins it was around the time of the release of the 2006 Australian-American film Happy Feet. Warrnambool City Council and Deakin University run the Middle Island Maremma Project which has helped the penguin population survive after being threatened by foxes . Once every two weeks during the breeding season, a group of volunteers look for the penguins on Middle Island to count them . ‘The media all round the world just went berserk. We had the BBC and National Geographic and Japan and every TV channel in the country,’ he explained. Jacobson’s film, which recently wrapped filming, is not a documentary. 'They’ve used their artistic license,' Swampy said. In one scene a fox will be shown coming into the bathroom where a rescued penguin is living. Swampy laughed: ‘In real life you are not allowed to pick up penguins and take them home.’ The movie is set until the dogs started working on Middle Island but Swampy said the ‘funny stuff has happened since then’ and thus he’s eager for a sequel to be made. One of his many anecdotes from his adventures with Oddball revolves around the time a penguin pecked her on the nose. ‘She still has a pink spot,’ he laughed. ‘I’m sitting there with this aboriginal elder guy called John and we could not concentrate it was so funny,’ he said. Dog handler Phil Root with Middle Island's current guards Eudy and Tula: Swampy explained that the dogs guard the territory, 'they are cohabiting [with the penguins]. They don't bond with them, they put up with them' Eudy and Tula live on the Island for a week at a time and are the 6th and 7th dogs to take part in the project to save the penguins . By the end of this year, Swampy could be leaving his huge Victorian chook farm behind to jet around America and Europe for the film’s red carpet promotional trail. ‘They said “make sure your passport is up to date” and I said “make sure your cheque book is up to date”,’ he laughed. Meanwhile, Oddball is living the ‘life of leisure’. She spends her afternoons on the veranda under the sun. ‘She has worked hard for 13 years that’s the equivalent of 90 years human work, she has done well,’ he said. Swampy had to put her brother down 12 months ago because he had stomach cancer and said ‘the two had been inseparable’. ‘That’s part of the reason she swam off the island before because she’d never been alone,’ he said. The farmer cannot talk highly enough of his maremmas, including Oddball who once comforted him after he fell off the back of his truck and badly winded himself. ‘The next thing I knew oddball was cuddled up to me looking after me,’ he recalled. The passionate dog lover said ‘we need to give animals a great deal more respect for their abilities than we do.’ ‘We think we are the Supreme Being, in fact we are the meanest predator,’ he said. Phil Root looks after the maremmas now that Oddball has retired . Oddball may now be retired but Swampy still patrols the beach off the coast of Warrnambool two or three times a week with his dog Max, who leaves his scent to ward off the foxes. As for the penguins, they are thriving and are back up to a population of around 100. Middle Island is currently cut off from unwanted visitors because of a high-swell but two maremmas – Eudy and Tula - live on the Island for a week at a time. They are the 6th and 7th dogs, looked after by dog handler Phil Root, to be used for the project and the island has remained fox free since the maremmas were introduced in 2006. And just as Oddball's legend lives on in the local community, so does Swampy’s. ‘I guess he’s one of the creative existential thinkers that we all have in our cities. ‘He’s obviously someone one that thinks outside the square,’ Ian Fitzgibbon, Warrnambool council’s driver of the Middle Island Maremma Project said. ‘We just pulled together all the parts of the puzzle which turned Swampy’s ideas into reality.'","Allan Marsh persuaded his local council to allow his dog to guard penguins .

"Consumers are ignoring the 'smart' features of their TV and simply want access to online video services such as the BBC's iPlayer, new research has found. Although manufacturers have given their latest sets the ability to tweet, view websites and even download apps, research firm NPD says all consumers really watch to do on their TV is watch TV. 'The Internet connected HDTV screen has so far failed to break beyond the bounds of its TV-centric heritage, with little use for the big screen beyond the obligatory video services,' said John Buffone, Director, Devices, NPD Connected Intelligence. One of Samsung's flagship smart TVs, which offers apps and access to twitter and Facebook. However, research now claims most consumers simply use it to watch TV . The research is a major blow for TV manufacturers who have invested millions in creating internet connected sets that can run apps. Many are set to reveal new models within days at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, where gadget makers traditionally unveil their products for the coming year. It also comes amid countless rumours and hints that Apple is developing its own TV, with CEO Tim Cook recently saying the area was one the firm has an 'intense interest' in. 'The results are both good and bad news for TV manufacturers,' says NPD. 'On the positive side, the TV itself . remains the fundamental screen for TV viewing within the home and is . seeing an expanded array of programming through OTT services that . supplement Pay TV subscriptions. 'The less than great news is that the TV manufacturers are failing to make the TV more than, well, a TV.' Google's TV has failed to capture the public's attention, despite support from manufacturers such as Sony . The biggest problem, according to NPD, is confusion among TV owners. 'The challenge may be that too much choice is creating a complex user experience,' it said. 'it’s no wonder that most connected consumers are currently stopping short of exploring options beyond video. 'To counter this, OEMs and retailers need to focus less on new innovation in this space and more on simplification of the user experience and messaging if they want to drive additional, and new, behaviors on the TV.' According to Luke Peters, Editor of T3 magazine, smart TVs are simply too complicated. 'Smart TVs will only become mainstream . when they are as easy as changing a channel,' he told MailOnline. What smart TV owners are actually doing: Watching more TV . 'Currently it's just too complex for the majority of people, you need to go through a . complex menu system, and then the content isn't always great. 'The range of content needs to get a lot better. 'Social networks like twitter just doesn't make much sense - people will use them on a tablet on their lap rather their TV. 'For smart TVs to succeed, they have to offer smart content, linking with tablets and other devices.' Google and Microsoft have already tried to simplify the experience by bringing together TV service under a single product. However, Google's TV efforts have not been a huge success, while Microsoft has chosen to turn its Xbox 360 into a home hub, claiming that consumers can then simply use the console they already have. Broadcasters such as Sky have also embraced internet TV, offering users access to catchup services through their set top boxes and access to shows via mobile devices. However, many in the industry are waiting for Apple to show its hand after the dozens of rumours that the Steve Jobs led project would produce a range of big screen TVs with a revolutionary interface. Apple already make a £99 TV box which allows users to download and watch films, TV shows and music. However, it is believed to be working on its own TV set, with Steve Jobs claiming the firm has 'cracked' TV before his death last year . The Apple co-founder, who died in October 2011, told his biographer, Walter Isaacson, that he had 'cracked' the problem of television, although Isaacson did not reveal the plans as the product has not been launched. Late last year, 'industry sources' were quoted as saying that Apple would launch 32-inch and 37-inch television sets some time this year - and although they are yet to materialise, the latest rumours claim the firm could launch 50 and 55inch models next year.","New figures reveal consumers are ignoring the 'smart TV' features such as apps and twitter access, instead simply watching catch up' video over the internet .

"Along a corridor inside Villa Park, Manuel Pellegrini knew what was coming. Did Yaya Toure’s stunningly graceful opener indicate the summer of discontent was finally over and he is back to his best? The Manchester City manager is very adept at handling situations like this. Not too high after a victory, never too low in defeat. After Toure’s shenanigans with birthday cakes and seemingly wanting out in pre-season, the manager’s stance is wise. ‘I don’t want to focus on all the things Yaya did,’ was the response from Pellegrini, who claims the summer engineering from Toure’s agent Dimitri Seluk to get him out of the club was all a misunderstanding. Yaya Toure's form has been under scrutiny but Manuel Pellegrini has thrown his support behind his player . Toure (centre) broke his goal-scoring duck for the season with a stunning left-footed effort against Aston Villa . ‘I support him in the good games and in the bad games. I trust what he can do. I speak with him every day. I know what he thinks and know the way he works. ‘He was working in the perfect way. He always criticises himself on when he is going to return to his normal performance. ‘When I see the players work every day I know about their commitment to the project or not. I have a squad I can manage with different names but for the whole squad the commitment is very important. In this squad I don’t have any problem with any player.’ Although Toure’s goal was brilliant, he was generally poor on Saturday. The Ivorian gave possession away needlessly throughout — one particular 10-yard pass flew out of play — and his final ball was often ill-judged. City players celebrate with Toure after his goal set them on their way to a 2-0 victory over Villa . City boss Pellegrini said: ‘I support [Toure] in the good games and in the bad games' This is nothing new for Pellegrini. As he alluded to after this win, the champions had to put up with Toure’s infuriating performances last season, only for them to be forgotten after a classy swish of a boot and the 20 goals it brought. ‘If they want to, they (the critics) can continue,’ was Toure’s retort. ‘Sometimes people forget that I’m a midfielder and my job is not to score goals all the time.’ There is no doubting that Toure is one of — if not the — best central midfielder in the Premier League. But here he only really played for 15 minutes. City need something extra, more consistent. Pablo Zabaleta indicated as much. ‘We need him back to his best form in terms of passing, even free-kicks,’ the Argentine said. ‘We are 100 per cent sure we will see the best of Yaya soon. He’s been OK for us and he knows how important he is for that team. ‘If he is on his best form, Yaya can do whatever he wants because he’s just different class. We are at our best when Yaya is at his best.’ Despite his goal, Toure wasn't at his best for Manchester City against Aston Villa . The Ivory Coast international (right) looked lethargic when the hosts broke quickly on the counter-attack . City were at their most fluent against Paul Lambert’s side when Pellegrini opted to replace Edin Dzeko with Fernando and play three in midfield. Toure could then breathe and made the difference. But while that tactical manoeuvre swung the contest, Pellegrini is insistent on persisting with two up front — even in the Champions League. Roma sussed them out comfortably last week and City have come under increasing scrutiny in Europe for not being able to adapt to different propositions — particularly this time last year when they were humbled by Pep Guardiola’s Bayern Munich. ‘I repeat that for me it isn’t a tactical problem,’ the Chilean added. ‘We have a lot of statistics on games when we play with two and how many we play with one. The most amount of games that we win is with two strikers and four midfielders. ‘We can make changes — it is important to do it. I can’t always speak about a game we played against Bayern Munich one year ago. We played 70 games and didn’t have any problem, except that match because we played very badly with two strikers.'

"A Tory MP has insisted he is not homophobic – because he once fought a gay boxer with the nickname the Pink Pounder. David Davies, the MP for Monmouth, outraged many equal rights campaigners when he said that parents hoped for heterosexual children because they wanted grandchildren. But he compounded his apparent offence when he took to Twitter to defend himself against charges that he was bigoted. Hendon MP David Davies (left) directed critics of his comments to view a video of his boxing bout (right) with Charles 'Pink Pounder' Jones.  David 'Tory Tornado' Davies is wearing the white top in the fight . He described his antics with Charles ‘Pink Pounder’ Jones on the social networking site: ‘Once fought gay boxer. Respect & like.’ Defeated in the ring: Charles 'the Pink Pounder' Jones . He added: ‘Trained with after bout so . not bigoted. activists calm down- listen to other views.’ He also posted . a link to a poor quality video of the fight on YouTube. Mr Davies – whose nickname is The Tory Tornado – is an amateur boxer. He . beat Mr Jones, an architect who is Britain’s first openly gay boxer, on . points over three rounds in the 2008 bout in a central London gym. At . the time, Mr Jones, who was 48, said: ‘In the weeks leading up to the . fight, everyone was telling me I had to make mincemeat of him. 'I’m not . sure whether that was because they wanted me to win or because they . wanted to see an MP get beaten up, but suffice to say it was a . disappointment when I lost. ‘In my defence, he is 11 years my junior and extremely strong, but I was still on my feet by the end of the match.’ Mr Davies, 42, is a former tobacco-picker and lorry driver who also serves as a special constable. He once arrested a man carrying a loaded gun. His initial remarks about gay children came in the middle of Tory wrangling over gay marriage. Senior Tories, including former prime . minister Sir John Major, Chancellor George Osborne, Education Secretary . Michael Gove and London Mayor Boris Johnson are backing measures to . permit equal marriage. But 120 Conservative MPs have indicated some degree of unease at the proposals in correspondence with constituents. Mr . Davies told the BBC: ‘I think most people are very tolerant and have no . problem at all if people are gay but, and I hate to say this in a way . because I expect it’s going to cause controversy, but I think most . parents would prefer their children not to be gay, knowing most parents . want grandchildren if nothing else.’ He . laid bare the party’s tensions over the subject, saying: ‘There is a . political calculation here, at some level, that this is going to be good . and that if we go ahead with it, David Cameron’s going to be carried . shoulder high back into Number 10 by Stonewall [gay rights] activists. ‘What . is going to happen is that we’re going to lose a large number of very . loyal activists who’ve gone out and campaigned for us over the years and . who don’t like this idea, so politically it’s barking mad.’ Tory MP David Davies defended himself against claims he was bigoted by linking to a video of him fighting a gay boxer called Charles 'Pink Pounder' Jones .

"Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is blaming ‘mixed messages’ sent by the Republican Party to voters for the loss of the White House while warning the party of the United States' changing majority. In her first interview since President Obama's re-election, Rice blamed the GOP's failure over 'mixed messages’ in immigration and women's issues during the election campaign. After women, black, Asian and Hispanic voters dominated Obama's supporters, she told CBS This Morning that the changing face of America 'really necessitates' new thinking. Scroll down for video . Blame: In her first interview since President Obama's re-election Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice blamed the Republican party's loss on mixed messages sent by the party . 'When you send mixed messages ... sometimes people hear only one side of that,' she said specifically of immigration when asked if she thought her party had been misunderstood. Rice says the GOP came close to matching the Democrats in the popular vote. But she also acknowledges that 'clearly we are losing important segments' of the electorate. Exit poll results showed 93 per cent of blacks, 71 per cent of Hispanics, and 73 per cent of Asians having voted Democrat this week. Fifty-five per cent of women added to that support with men making up 52 per cent of Republican votes cast. New target: Exit poll results showed 93 per cent of blacks, 71 per cent of Hispanics, 73 per cent of Asians and 55 per cent of women having voted Democrat this week . Rice added that the party needs to 'appeal to those groups.' Responding to those numbers in agreement this week was Republican strategist John Stineman from Iowa. 'Clearly, when you look at African-American and Latino voters, they went overwhelmingly for the president,' he said. 'And that's certainly a gap that's going to require a lot of attention from Republicans.' Naming her own attempt to bridge that gap she said was the speech she delivered at the Republican National Convention in August. Bridging the gap: Speaking at the Republican National Convention, the former secretary said immigration is not just a key to an election's demographics but who we are as America . ‘I said that I thought for instance immigration was a key to not just the demographics of an election but to who we are as Americas,’ she said. ‘That’s really the argument that we need to be making.’ Asked if she would be interested in succeeding Hillary Rodham Clinton as secretary of state, even if asked to do so by President Obama, she readily said she'd decline the offer. 'I'm going to support my president but I'm going to stay at Stanford,' she said, referring to her role as professor of Political Economy at the California university.

"A controversial sculpture recently erected in a small town is being moved today to spare the blushes of the locals. The artwork, entitled 'Blue Human Condition' has been the talk of Adrian, Michigan since it was installed on April 21. The statue is of seven, gender-neutral figures intertwined in varying standing and seated shapes. It was covered with tarp after some residents complained about its apparent sexual innuendo. The artwork called 'Blue Human Condition' has caused blushes in Adrian, Michigan due to the positioning of some of the figures . The sculpture currently sits next to the city offices but will be moved to a more secluded spot in Yew Park where the public will still have full access to it, a city official told lenconnect.com . The piece was created by sculptor Mark Chatterley of Williamston and had been rented as part of a public art program. Mr Chatterley told MailOnline today: 'I think it's rather funny and a shame all the brouhaha about it. I'm disappointed, it was in a great spot. But I'm glad the city still want it as part of the show.' The sculptor, who has exhibited all over the U.S. and the world in his 30-year career, said he is a little worried about his statue being moved to a more secluded spot. He said: 'I'm worried because it's made of clay and could be destroyed. The spot it is in right now is next to the police station.' Mr Chatterley said that 'Blue Human Condition' represents how people cannot survive on their own and we all need help from everyone around us- but denied any sexual connotations to his work. He said: 'It's about how we are all in one big group together and rely on each other.' Sculptor Mark Chatterley with another one of his pieces.
