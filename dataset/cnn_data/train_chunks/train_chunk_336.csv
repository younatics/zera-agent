"(CNN) -- Investigators found ""widespread cracking"" on the skin of a Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 that made an emergency landing in Arizona after a hole opened on top of the aircraft during flight Friday, a National Transportation Safety Board member said Sunday. A flight attendant received minor injuries when the hole opened and the cabin depressurized 18 minutes after the plane took off from Phoenix bound for Sacramento, California, NTSB member Robert Sumwalt told reporters. The flight data recorder indicated the plane was cruising at 36,000 feet when it depressurized, but it dropped to 11,000 within 4 1/2 minutes, Sumwalt said. The pilot initially planned to return to Phoenix to land, but after the flight attendants reported seeing blue sky through the jet's roof he made an emergency landing at a military base in Yuma, Arizona, Sumwalt said. The initial inspection found ""clear evidence that the skin separated at the lower rivet line"" where ""the skin comes together on the aircraft,"" Sumwalt said. The cracking would likely not be visible during routine inspections, but could have been seen when the plane underwent major maintenance and was disassembled in March 2010, Sumwalt said. The hole that opened up was 5 feet long and 1 foot wide, he said. Southwest mechanics cut away the section of the plane containing the hole and are sending it overnight to the NTSB laboratory in Washington, the board said. Southwest grounded 79 of its planes for inspection for ""aircraft skin fatigue"" Saturday. As of Sunday afternoon, 19 planes were returned to service after ""intense inspection,"" the airline said in a statement. However, ""small, subsurface cracks"" or indications of cracks were detected in three other aircraft. ""Further evaluation and potential repairs will be necessary before those planes are returned to service,"" the statement said. The additional cracks found Sunday were no more than 1/4 inch in size, the NTSB said. The inspections of the remaining aircraft are expected to be completed by late Tuesday. Boeing is sending a service bulletin to airlines with recommendations for how to inspect their planes for similar cracks, the NTSB said Sunday. Southwest canceled about 300 flights Saturday and Sunday to accommodate the inspections. It advised customers to check the status of their particular flight or rebook their trip before heading to the airport. Representatives from the NTSB, the Federal Aviation Administration, Boeing and the airline organized into teams to investigate the aircraft's structure, metallurgical aspects of the plane, flight data recordings and its maintenance records, Sumwalt said. Meanwhile, some of the 118 passengers who were aboard the crippled Boeing 737 said they had feared for their lives. ""We were in shock,"" passenger Debbie Downey told CNN Saturday. ""We were in row 16 and my husband and I could see blue sky ... the wiring, the cabling. It actually was terrifying."" She said, ""a lot of people were crying and holding hands"" but had trouble hearing due to the noise of air rushing through the plane's opening. ""It was very, very scary."" ""I heard a loud popping sound about three or four minutes before it blew open on us,"" passenger Greg Hansen said. ""(Then) a big explosion happened. A big noise, and from there, you felt some of the air being sucked out. It happened right behind me, in the row behind me and it covers about 2 1/2 rows,"" he said from seat 11C. Hansen, 41, a regional sales manager for a biotech company, was flying home to Sacramento, California, from a business trip. Some people panicked and screamed as the blue sky and sun began to shine through the cabin in midflight, he said. ""Most people were just white knuckles holding onto the arm rests. The pilots did a great job and were under control to get us to a manageable level,"" he said. But just behind him, Hansen said he could see the jagged edge of the aircraft where the rivets used to be. ""You can see the insulation and wiring. The interior ceiling panel was bouncing up and down with the air,"" he said. ""It was surreal, when you're riding in a modern aircraft. You're used to being enclosed and not having the window rolled down,"" he said. Passenger Brenda Reese told CNN affiliates KCRA and KOVR she began to fear for her life. ""I was texting my sister to make certain that she told my kids that I loved them,"" Reese said. Southwest Flight 812, which had a five-member crew, then made an emergency landing at Yuma Marine Corps Air Station/International Airport at 5:07 p.m. (7:07 p.m. ET.) The Federal Aviation Administration said the captain made a rapid, controlled descent from 36,000 feet to about 11,000 feet after the cabin lost pressure. Southwest said it provided a full refund, an apology and two complimentary round-trip passes on the airline for future flights. The second flight landed in Sacramento on Friday night. Boeing spokeswoman Julie O'Donnell declined to comment on possible causes of the incident. ""Boeing is committed to ensuring safe flight and to supporting our customers,"" the company said in a statement. ""We are working closely with Southwest and are providing technical assistance to the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board as it investigates the incident."" A total of 288 Boeing 737-300s are currently operating in the U.S. fleet, and 931 operate worldwide, according to the FAA. Journalist Rachel Elzufon contributed to this report.","""Small, subsurface cracks"" found in three other Southwest planes .

"(CNN) -- Everyone knows about the risks that narcotics pose and the lethal war waged against them. But there are probably far more deaths caused by dangerous therapeutic medicines. Lazy, cost-cutting manufacturers and criminal counterfeiters make billions of dollars a year peddling products that may kill you, which you might find online or even at your neighborhood pharmacy. I first came across dangerous drugs while evaluating HIV and malaria projects in Southern Africa eight years ago. Patients were dying because the pills did not provide the needed medicine. Fakes contained chalk, talcum powder, road paint and occasionally dangerous heavy metals, instead of the expensive, hard-to-make medicine. FDA commissioner talks counterfeit drugs . Terrorist organizations such as Hezbollah have profited from this trade, but no group has so far used it as a weapon. Most producers of bad products are not trying to kill patients. They are out to make money and simply do not care who gets hurt, or even dies, in the process. It is impossible to know the exact size of the trade or its lethal impact -- some guesses are as high as 700,000 deaths globally each year. I estimate that bad medicines cause at least 100,000 deaths annually. Some markets are barely affected, while others are replete with substandard products. Playing Russian roulette with fake drugs . ""Pharmaceutical counterfeiting is a low-risk, high-profit criminal enterprise that attracts entrepreneurs and organized criminals,"" says John P. Clark, vice president and chief security officer for the drug company Pfizer. ""What was once seen as a problem limited to lifestyle medicines is now recognized as a threat from which no therapeutic area is immune."" Up to a third of the market for anti-malarials are suspect in some way, and around 10% of all essential drugs in emerging markets fail basic quality tests. While the United States is much better served -- far less than 1% of all drugs are faulty -- even if only 0.001% of the 4 billion prescriptions filled in this country every year were compromised, 40,000 prescriptions could be deadly. More worryingly, lethal drug incidents are on the rise in the United States. Fakes of heparin, a blood-thinning drug, killed 149 Americans in 2007 and 2008, and many more deaths likely go undetected every year. FDA: Beware of 'fake' potassium iodide . In most cases, no crime is suspected as the consumers are often quite sick and the evidence is swallowed. If a relative with a heart problem dies from a heart attack, who would think to investigate the medicine? But fake Plavix, Medicare's most-often reimbursed heart medication, has been found in numerous countries. Before the civil war in Syria, its capital, Damascus, was home to a major counterfeit drug operation that made tens of millions of dollars between 2003 and 2009. The ring manufactured more than 80 brands -- including Plavix -- of fake medicine very convincingly, only distinguishable from real drugs by experts. Yet none of them contained the correct ingredients. Fake antibiotics, cancer and heart medications penetrated every major market of the Middle East, including the one funded by U.S. tax dollars in Iraq. While part of the operation was shut down in 2009, some gang members fled and reassembled in Iraq and Iran. My sources in the Middle East believe that this gang may have begun operations again in Damascus, bribing officials with their vast wealth to turn a blind eye. Most worrying for Americans, they may have been the source of the fake cancer-drug Avastin that surfaced in California, Illinois and Texas in March and April. Fighting the growing menace of fake drugs . U.S. authorities are limited in combating illegal trades outside the United States. International law is currently inadequate to combat international fake drug rings, and there is a need for a global treaty against such products. I am optimistic that this will change within the next decade; international laws will be strengthened, and global efforts against counterfeiters will constrain their activities. But I am less certain that governments will effectively tackle legal producers who make bad products. These companies pay their taxes, provide jobs and have political clout across numerous emerging markets. Cutthroat competition among chemical and drug manufacturers keeps prices low, but it also encourages corner-cutting. In some emerging markets, there are more than 300 brands of the same class of medicine. Local regulators do not have enough competent staff to conduct either thorough inspections of all production plants or survey products in the market. Consequently, companies routinely get away with substandard production. Most tragically, these producers undercut better producers on price and sometimes force more responsible players to exit the market. Chinese and Indian producers dominate many drug categories in emerging markets, notably anti-infectives. While many of these companies make good medicines, a substantial subset routinely target poor markets with substandard versions. Until regulators and customers in emerging markets demand better products, tens of thousands will be killed by substandard drugs, and unfortunately some of these products will make their way to U.S. markets, too. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roger Bate.","Author says manufacturers and counterfeiters make billions peddling killer products .

"(CNN) -- First time in Seattle? Here are some hints to help you get the most from the city. Free Thursday Seattle's many museums and galleries regularly offer visitors free admission. On the first Thursday of every month there's no admission charge at Seattle Art Museum, the Experience Music Project or the Seattle Asian Art Museum, which is also free for families on the first Saturday of the month. Entry to the Museum of Flight is free between 5pm and 9pm on the first Thursday of the month and The Henry Art Gallery offers free entry every Thursday. Mount Ranier looms over Seattle. Rainy days While New York and more Miami have a higher annual rainfall than Seattle, the Emerald City seems to attract a particularly persistent perma-drizzle. If you want to make like a true Seattleite, you'll eschew the umbrella, braving the elements in nothing more than an anorak. If, however, you're more interested in staying dry than in blending in, carry an umbrella at all times. Out on ""The Sound"" For memorable views of the Seattle shoreline and Mount Rainier beyond, take a Washington State Ferry across Puget Sound to Bainbridge Island. Bainbridge Island won't detain you for too long, but the 35-minute journey will give you a unique perspective on Seattle and its surroundings. Board from the main terminal at Pier 52 on Alaskan Way. Ferries are frequent but there can be long queues to board at the weekend and on weekdays during rush hour (www.wsdot.wa.gov/ferries/). The great outdoors Seattle is surrounded by majestic mountains and spectacular scenery. That colossal mountain you can see to the south-east of Seattle is actually a volcano -- Mount Rainier, the highest peak in the Cascade Range at over 14,000 ft. Mount Rainier National Park lies some 100 miles from the city and boasts numerous glaciers and fantastic hiking trails. Entry is $15 for a private vehicle (www.nps.gov/mora/). Mount St Helens, about 100 miles further south, last exploded in 1980, destroying hundreds of square miles of forest. Signs of the devastation can still be seen if you visit Mount St Helens National Volcanic Monument (www.fs.fed.us/gpnf/mshnvm/). The Olympic National Park lies across Puget Sound and includes the Hoh rainforest and Pacific wilderness beaches, where you may be lucky enough to glimpse gray whales in the spring and autumn. For killer-whale watching, take a ferry to the San Juan Islands, where you're virtually guaranteed a sighting. ...................... What are your tips for a great stay in Seattle?

"(CNN) -- When strangers hear Peter Jefferson's voice, they can't quite place it at first, and then it hits them: ""I know you. You've been sending me to sleep for years."" For anyone else it would be the greatest insult. For 68-year-old Jefferson, it's a testament to the very special connection people have with his mellifluous tone, even rhythm, and measured volume. It's a voice pharmaceutical companies could only dream of bottling. Why the sleepy fanfare? For over 40 years Jefferson was the man behind one of Britain's most cherished -- and baffling -- radio bulletins: the shipping forecast. Those living outside the United Kingdom may never have heard of this broadcasting curio, but sit tight. Snuggle under the covers, grab a mug of something warm, and prepare to be gently rocked by an ocean far far away. And if you still don't get it, don't worry too much. Neither do half the people who listen to it -- that's its magic. ""And now, the shipping forecast..."" When London rolled back the curtains for its Olympic opening ceremony last year, it took the world on a meandering journey through industrial folk songs, Beatles anthems, Mr Bean's piano-playing, and of course -- the shipping forecast. ""Viking, North Utsire, South Utsire, southerly or south easterly, six or seven. Fair, good..."" What is it? A sat-nav gone bonkers? No, it's the weather conditions of 31 ocean regions around the United Kingdom, broadcast four times a day on BBC radio. First aired in 1924, the forecast has become both a life-saving bulletin for mariners, and a hypnotic litany of nonsensical seafaring phrases for the rest of us. ""People listen to it late at night, tucked up in bed, perhaps at the end of a long day,"" said Jefferson, who read the forecast from 1969 to 2010. ""It's been likened to poetry, to a prayer, it contains a lot of familiar phrases, words and names and places -- it's very comforting."" Mysterious muse . Long before the 2012 Games, generations of artists have immortalized this mysterious muse of the air waves. Nobel Prize-winning poet Seamus Heaney, who passed away in August, dedicated a sonnet to the baffling bulletin: ""Conjured by that strong gale-warning voice, Collapse into a sibilant penumbra."" While English TV personality Stephen Fry had his own tongue-in-cheek rendition: ""Blowy, quite misty, sea sickness. Not many fish around, come home, veering suggestively."" Listen to Stephen Fry's rendition here . For such a treasured part of British culture, perhaps the greatest joy comes from not understanding the shipping forecast at all -- three minutes to let the mind wander among monotonous tones, far flung places, and random numbers. Avid listener Peter Collyer was so intrigued by these faceless places, he traveled to all 31 regions and painted what he saw -- often on the deck of a lurching ferry. ""Everybody knows the names of these places but no one knows what it looks like,"" said 60-year-old Collyer, whose hazy watercolors appear in the book ""Rain Later, Good: Painting the Shipping Forecast."" ""It's just a mesmerizing list of places and names. So I wanted to be the person to go out there and de-mystify it for them."" Radio reigns . In an era when weather forecasts are only a Google-search away, why do people still tune into this old-fashioned bulletin, arguably the modern equivalent of the Sirens? Indeed, the forecast has changed little in the last eight decades, following a strict format of 350 words -- sometimes giving it a jumbled sound to the untrained ear. ""It's the rhythm of it,"" said Jefferson, author of the book  ""And now the shipping forecast."" ""It's the magic of hearing about places you'll probably never go to."" ""A lot of people say it feels as though the shipping forecast is speaking to them, and them alone."" The last and slightly longer announcement at 12.48am has become renowned for putting night owls to bed, with Jefferson receiving letters from listeners thanking him for his soothing words on restless nights. Life saver . That's not to say the shipping forecast doesn't have an important seafaring function. ""It all came about because a while back there was such a horrendous loss of life at sea,"" said Jefferson. ""People had no idea what the weather was going to be like when they went out on the water. ""The shipping forecast was brought in, and has saved a lot of people's lives."" For others, it's a different life-saver, transporting them each night to a watery world on the edge of imagination.","Can't sleep? Never fear, the shipping forecast is here .
For almost 90 years, BBC radio's weather forecast has entranced listeners .
Aired four times a day, the bulletin has been immortalized by artists .

"(CNN) -- Tonight we find out whether it's time for a team of destiny or a team that's a new type of dynasty. Kansas City Royals fans have really enjoyed this season of surprises, with their unheralded team battling into its first World Series in almost three decades. And San Francisco Giants fans have really enjoyed the even-numbered seasons lately. It goes like this: 2010, World Series champs. 2011, not even in the playoffs. 2012, World Series champs. 2013, a losing record. Sure, you can argue that ""dynasty"" is a label that doesn't apply to a team that doesn't have a string of trophy wins and doesn't come into each new season as the favorite to win another. The idea of any team winning titles every year pretty much evaporated in the last century. No team has even won back-to-back crowns since the Yankees in 1998 and 1999. So what's up with these Giants? The secret of the Giants' success really isn't a secret. It comes down to good managing and great pitching. Giants Manager Bruce Bochy told Sport Illustrated: ""You have to keep calm any way you can and relay that to the players. This is a special group. They don't need a lot of help with that part. But the manager's job also is the feel you get for which guys can handle (pressure) and who can't."" San Francisco stations ban Lorde's 'Royals' ahead of World Series . That's what each of his Series winning teams have done, played with poise. They've won the tight games, buoyed by the superb pitching and fielders who don't make errors. ""Pitching and defense are going to win you games. I know it's a cliche answer, but until you can prove to me otherwise, I'll stick with that answer,"" Giants reliever Jeremy Affeldt told MLB.com. 7 reasons San Francisco is a winner . The Giants are not like the Yankees of the '50s when year after year they put the same nine on the field, and when Yogi Berra won more rings than fingers on one hand. Sure, all-star catcher Buster Posey has been a constant, but Bleacher Report notes that the rest of the lineup card has changed. ""In the team's three World Series pushes, it has had three different second basemen, left fielders, center fielders and closers. It has had two first basemen, shortstops, third basemen and right fielders,"" writes Bleacher Report. Bochy says having some fresh faces each year gives a fresh desire to win. ""That was part of our motivation when this whole thing started. Let's find a way to give them a chance and get them to the World Series,"" he told reporters before the Fall Classic began. It also helps when the new talent fills in the gaps left behind by departures and injuries. The big trouble facing the Giants on Wednesday night is the visiting team factor. It's been forever since a road team won a Game 7 in the World Series. It was 1979 when Pittsburgh took the title at Baltimore. The Royals were involved in one of those games since, winning the 1985 World Series at home in a final game blowout. It was the franchise's last sniff of glory. 7 reasons Kansas City is a winner . The likeable Royals have delighted not only K.C. fans but hardcore baseball fans, too. They have perpetually been underdogs and it's been refreshing to watch a small TV market team have a chance at a crown. But the players don't think of themselves as party spoilers. ""We know we're a good team. To us, we're not the underdogs. We're just going out there and playing the game and having some fun,"" third baseman Mike Moustakas told MLB.com. Manager Ned Yost said his team doesn't pay attention to what the media says. They are only concerned with playing their best baseball, and in October, they have been. And it's brought joy to fans all over. ""I think America has fallen in love with this group because of their energy, their passion, their fun-loving nature,"" Yost said before Game 7. ""Even through the most stressful times, you can't (look) in our dugout and not see them laughing and having a good time with each other, and I think people love seeing that."" Yost also said he foresees this team being pretty good for years, given a young core of rising stars. Of course, even if they win tonight, it's too early to use that ""D"" word.","The San Francisco Giants have won two World Series in recent years .
The Kansas City Royals haven't won one since 1985 .
Giants roster has changed but their method of winning hasn't .
Royals don't pay attention to underdog label, they just go out to have fun ."
"(CNN) -- Do the hopeless causes have hope? If so, how much? When it comes to the wide world of sports, it springs eternal. Anyone who saw baseball's Kansas City Royals fight their way into the World Series for the first time since 1985, only to lose to the San Francisco Giants in Game 7 Wednesday night, was reminded that losers have been known to turn into winners. The Giants know that feeling. When they took the World Series in 2010, they had gone without a championship for 56 years. Now they have their third in five years. The Royals will have to wait till next year for a chance at baseball's ultimate prize, but other unexpected teams could surprise us in the meantime. Who might that be? Projections that the Cleveland Cavaliers could meet the Los Angeles Clippers for the National Basketball Association's next championship have not as yet been met with a ha-ha-ha, you-kill-me kind of maniacal laugh. It could happen, relatively smart NBA people believe. Both bad franchises suddenly look uncommonly good. A question of whether the Detroit Lions could finally make it to a Super Bowl now exists, halfway through this National Football League season, without the requisite rolling of eyeballs or a yeah, yeah, yeah, when-pigs-fly kind of reply. It remains improbable, but not impossible, like convincing Matthew McConaughey to make a TV commercial for a car. Not every cause is lost. Some are merely misplaced. Individually in the Long Overdue Dept. of life, Sergio Garcia, 34, is a successful pro golfer who has never won a Grand Slam tournament, or one of the ""majors,"" as they in the PGA say. Danica Patrick, 32, has yet to win a NASCAR race behind the wheel. John Isner, 29, has not been beyond the quarterfinals in a Grand Slam event of tennis. In other sports shots heard 'round the world, not once has the winning goal of a World Cup championship match been struck by a certain soccer team we like to call ""USA, USA, USA!"" Gotta happen SOMETIME, yes? Doesn't it? Kansas City had not been to a World Series for 29 years, but finally got its act together this fall. Seattle's pro football squad hadn't won a Super Bowl game, but that finally happened in 2014. Los Angeles' hockey team endured decades without claiming a Stanley Cup, but now has drunk out of two of the last three. Teams gotta dream. Some year has to be your year. When previously overpowering organizations such as the Boston Celtics, Dallas Cowboys or Los Angeles Dodgers become teams that no longer play for the championship year after year, your team could actually stand a chance. No one fears the New York Yankees nowadays; they are pretty much just another pretty good team. Who'll finally get lucky? Whose fateful year will it finally be? Here they come, Hopeless Causes R Us: . CLEVELAND CAVALIERS (NBA) Last NBA championship: None. They joined the league in 1970. They got their hands on LeBron James and lost him. They lost 26 games in a row in the season of 2010-11. Were once again mocked as the ""Cleveland Cadavers."" Ah, but look who's back: King James himself. He went south to Miami for a few winters, turned the Heat into a hot property, then decided that he longed to return to his native Ohio, where he would try to win the Cavs a crown at last. You know what? They just might. DETROIT LIONS (NFL) Last NFL championship: 1957. More than likely, this season's Lions will retreat tails between legs to lick their wounds, as they do year after year. Since the name ""Super Bowl"" was applied to the league's big game, Detroit has hosted it, but never played in it. But the team's current record is 6-2. It is in first place in the NFC North. It has a legit playoff shot. Who's to say that after Katy Perry sings at halftime, the team from Motown won't win on Super Bowl Sunday and have Detroiters dancin' in the streets? ST. LOUIS BLUES (NHL) Last NHL championship: None. No team has been in the National Hockey League as long as this one has without winning a Stanley Cup at least once. Its trophy haul is an empty net. It looked like last season's team might change all that. St. Louis' record was a fine 52-23. Blues lovers jammed the Scottrade Center expecting to sing a new tune. Alas, out on a sour note they went, in the opening round of the playoffs. The Blues remain O-for-ever. BALTIMORE ORIOLES (MLB) Last World Series title: 1983. Oh, the O's of this season came SO close. They made their division rival Yankees, Red Sox, Blue Jays and Rays eat their dust. They won 30 more games than they lost. They broomed the man-eating Tigers right out of the playoffs. Even after losing two star players, Manny Machado and Chris Davis, at an inopportune time, the Orioles could have gone all the way. If not for a red-hot Kansas City ball club, Baltimore might well have won its first World Series title since 1983. LOS ANGELES CLIPPERS (NBA) Last NBA title: None. Donald Sterling, the boneheaded owner, is out. Steve Ballmer, the bald-headed owner, is in. Doc Rivers is a smart coach and there's a lot of talent on that court. On the other hand, these are still the Clippers, who have been demonstrating a million ways to die in the West since long before a Seth MacFarlane movie by that name came out. Yes, they really did beat the Lakers in a game last season 142-94. Is this team for real, though? It is not now-or-never, but almost. CLEVELAND BROWNS (NFL) Last NFL title: 1964. Hard to believe this franchise, football royalty, has never been to a Super Bowl even once. This season's record is 4-3. Not awesome, but not rotten. Maybe they can take their division. Maybe they can get on a roll. Maybe they can ask Kevin Costner, who played the Browns' general manager in the 2014 movie ""Draft Day,"" to join them on Super Bowl Sunday 2015, if truth turns out to be stranger than fiction. BUFFALO SABRES (NHL) Last NHL title: None. They tried nine different goaltenders last season -- repeat, NINE. That is a National Hockey League record. It is also ridiculous. Trades, hirings, firings, new ownership, nothing's worked. Not a single Stanley Cup for this franchise, founded in 1970. The honeymoon near Niagara Falls is long over. Time for the Sabres to stop fouling up in front of their fed-up fans. SEATTLE MARINERS (MLB) Last World Series title: None. Quick, name a team that's never even been IN a World Series. Bzzz, time's up. The answer is: Seattle's Mariners, one of the true underachieving organizations of all time. The M's were on the brink, missing this season's playoffs by just one game. They have a super pitcher in Felix Hernandez and a splendid player in Robinson Cano. What they do not have is a single World Series ring with a Mariner logo on any finger. If not soon, when? NEW YORK KNICKS (NBA) Last NBA title: 1973. Last time anybody expected a title: Hmmm, can't recall. Rings-on-every-finger Phil Jackson is in charge now. He helped the Bulls and Lakers try on NBA championship jewelry again and again. It's a long, long way from contender to champ, but maybe Jackson can figure out what his Madison Square Garden predecessors have not. SAN DIEGO CHARGERS (NFL) Last NFL title: None. Zero. It's a franchise that's been to only one Super Bowl, which it lost 49-26. This season's Chargers have a record of 5-3. They and quarterback Philip Rivers look sharp. Not as sharp as Peyton Manning's team and Tom Brady's team, but maybe lightning will strike. TORONTO MAPLE LEAFS (NHL) Last NHL title: 1967. Up there north of the border in Ontario the situation is bordering on tragicomic, kind of like Mayor Rob Ford's. A couple of seasons ago, the Leafs made the playoffs for the first time in quite a while. A franchise that won 13 Stanley Cups ought to be able to win a 14th somehow, sometime. CHICAGO CUBS (MLB) Last World Series title: 1908. Being the butt of every joke can't be easy. ""Lovable losers"" are still losers, no matter how their fans feel. When you go 106 years without a championship, you are not Cinderella finally going to the ball; you are Cinderella still scrubbing the floors. But, a young star or two, a couple of up-and-comers, and who knows? Good things do happen to bad teams. Although where the Cubs are concerned, nahhh.

"(CNN) -- The seesawing emotional highs and lows that infuse motor racing were perfectly illustrated at the inaugural Russian Grand Prix. Lewis Hamilton raced to an easy victory at the Sochi circuit on Sunday to secure a first-ever team title for Mercedes. The champagne bubbled in plastic cups and there were raucous renditions of ""We Are The Champions"" from the team garage. But Mercedes motorsport director Toto Wolff brought the revelers back to earth with a dose of reality. ""We don't forget about Jules,"" he told Sky television after the race. ""This is still overshadowing everything we do. The sport is a side story."" The Formula One community had a clear message in Russia -- it was racing for stricken Marussia driver Jules Bianchi, who is seriously ill after an accident seven days ago at the Japanese round of the world championship. His family revealed in a statement Thursday, the 25-year-old Frenchman had suffered a ""diffuse axonal injury,"" and was in a critical but stable condition at the Mie General Medical Center in Yokkaichi, Japan. The remaining 21 race drivers in Russia assembled at the front of the grid in a moving show of support for the popular Bianchi. They held a minute's silence in respect of their colleague before climbing into their cars. Marussia chose not to run Bianchi's car in Russia. Instead it stood in tribute on his side of the garage. On Sunday, members of the team gathered together on the grid with their sole driver Max Chilton holding a pit board that read: ""Racing for Jules."" Chilton, however, retired from the race after just nine laps with an unspecified problem with his car. ""It hasn't been an easy day, far from it, and all the guys have had to dig deep to get us to the grid,"" he said. ""It was very emotional with all the support for Jules. I think the team, the sport and all the fans have really done him proud. ""Somehow we need to find the strength to regroup and move forward, which is hard to contemplate right now."" At the front of the field, Hamilton raced to a flawless victory to extend his lead in the drivers' championship to 17 points over his Mercedes teammate Nico Rosberg. ""The car's been amazing this weekend and I really, really enjoyed the track,"" said Hamilton, who won the world title in 2008 with McLaren. ""Russia's been one of my favorite places so far this year, so it's very cool to have won the first race here."" Hamilton started in pole position and in his eagerness to swoop past him at the start, Rosberg locked up his tires going into the second corner and ran wide. The German immediately pitted for a new set of tires and rejoined the race in a lowly 20th position. Rosberg demonstrated his skill to make the rubber last for another 52 laps as he fought his way back up to second but it was another impatient mistake that dented his title chances. ""Half of me is extremely disappointed that I messed up today,"" Rosberg said. ""But the other half, I'm really, really happy, because everybody in the team deserves it so much. ""For them the most important title of the year is the constructors' championship."" Valtteri Bottas underlined his form by taking the final podium spot in a straightforward race for Williams for his fifth podium of the season. Despite the subdued atmosphere in F1's inner circle, there was a feeling of national pride at the Sochi circuit, which has breathed new life into the coastal park used for the 2014 Winter Olympics and Paralympics. A near capacity crowd of 55,000 fans came to the race, the first Russian Grand Prix in 100 years and the first ever in the world championship. President Putin made an unusual guest appearance at the end of the race, visiting the drivers in the waiting room before handing out the trophies on the podium. It is reported that Russia is paying $50m a year to host the race. F1 returns to racing at the U.S. Grand Prix in Austin, Texas in three weeks' time, while its close band of drivers anxiously await better news from Japan.","Lewis Hamilton wins the inaugural Russian Grand Prix from Mercedes rival Nico Rosberg .

"(CNN) -- Lewis Hamilton reserved a barnstorming final lap in qualifying for the Spanish Grand Prix to take his fourth pole of the season Saturday. With his 35th career pole, Hamilton relegated Mercedes teammate Nico Rosberg to second on the grid as he bids for his fourth straight win of the season. Victory in Sunday's race would see Hamilton leapfrog Rosberg in the world title standings and would be his first at the Circuit of Catalunya. But it proved another sorry afternoon for four-time defending champion Sebastian Vettel, who could not take part in the final part of qualifying after ""losing drive"" in his Red Bull, and was later penalized five grid places for a gearbox change. It left him 15th on the grid, while teammate Daniel Ricciardo of Australia again impressed by claiming third spot, although over a second slower on his lap than Hamilton. Finn Valtteri Bottas took a fine fourth for the revived Williams team, with Romain Grosjean giving Lotus a boost in fifth. Ferrari's home hero Fernando Alonso had hoped to give his vast following in Barcelona something to cheer, but had to settle for seventh on the grid, being out qualified by his teammate Kimi Raikkonen. Rosberg had raised hopes he could take pole ahead of Hamilton by being fastest in third practice and then in the opening two sessions of final qualifying. But Hamilton showed his superiority despite doubts he would have to give second best, clocking a time of one minute 25.232 seconds. ""Nico (Rosberg) has been driving really well through P3 and qualifying, so I didn't know if I could get it. At the end, I had to eek out everything and more from the car,"" he said. ""To have the kind of performance we have, I have never really known that before. I'm overwhelmed, so happy.""

"(CNN) -- Germany's Adrian Sutil has landed a drive with Sauber for the 2014 season, the Swiss Formula One team announced Friday. The 30-year-old Sutil has spent his previous six seasons in F1 with the Force India team, who had already confirmed Nico Hulkenberg and Sergio Perez as their drivers for the 2014 campaign. Sutil effectively swaps teams with highly-rated compatriot Hulkenberg, who achieved Sauber's best finish of 2013, a fourth place in the Korean Grand Prix. Sauber will look to build on that strong run at the end of last season and team principal Monisha Kaltenborn said they had been hoping to sign Sutil for some time. ""We have been wanting to work together with him for a while,"" she told the team's official website. ""Adrian is not only very fast, but also brings a lot of experience, which is very important looking at the new regulations for next year,"" she added. Sutil, who has made 109 career starts in F1, said he was delighted to finally seal a deal. ""In the end the negotiations took a bit longer than planned,"" he said. ""After six good years driving for Force India, with a lot of highlights, it's now time to embark on a new challenge,"" he added. Sutil made his debut in F1 in 2007 for the Spyker team, which was sold to the Force India syndicate a year later. He made the headlines for the wrong reasons in January 2012, when convicted by a German court on an assault charge after being involved in a nightclub incident in Shanghai following the 2011 Chinese Grand Prix. The ramifications from the incident meant Sutil missed the 2012 season, being replaced at Force India by Hulkenberg, who had been the reserve driver at Force India. Sutil regained his seat for 2013 and finished a fine seventh in his comeback race in Australia. Sauber has not named a second driver for the upcoming campaign although young Mexican Esteban Gutierrez may be retained. The driver switches have left Scotland's Paul di Resta, who was at Force India last season, without a confirmed drive for 2014.","Adrian Sutil signed by Sauber for 2014 season .

"(CNN) -- More areas of Bastrop County, Texas, were reopened to residents Monday following the devastating wildfire that destroyed more than 1,500 homes. ""Our goal is to get everybody back in by Thursday,"" said county Judge Ronnie McDonald. Many of the residents will return to charred homes and possessions. Those with standing homes may have to wait weeks for electricity to return, and crews are still working on restoring drinking water, utility officials said. The Bastrop County Complex fire near Austin was 60 percent contained Monday after burning across more than 34,000 acres, according to the Texas Forest Service. The fire is blamed for the deaths of two people whose bodies were found in the burned-out rubble of a neighborhood last week. An urban search-and-rescue team scouring the fire zone for victims was expected to complete its work Monday afternoon, Bastrop County Sheriff Terry Pickering said. Two people among residents of the fire zone remain missing, but authorities believe they are likely out of state, Pickering said. Some residents of the Tahitian Village East subdivision were allowed to return Sunday, as were residents with property affected by the Union Chapel fire, also in Bastrop County. Residents in neighborhoods northeast of the town of Bastrop were being allowed to return on Monday, with additional areas reopening through Thursday. Authorities have distributed vehicle placards for residents seeking entry into the fire zone, and so far the re-entry process has gone smoothly, Pickering said. A traffic backup early Monday had since cleared, he said. School also resumed Monday for residents of Bastrop County, as well as in Waller and Montgomery counties, where the Riley Road fire has burned thousands of acres. ""It's a relief actually. I've been cooped up at the house and can't really do anything,"" student Keeley Merrill told CNN affiliate KPRC-TV. With much of the state in an extreme drought, Texas has been scarred by one of the worst fire seasons in memory. Since January 1, nearly 3.7 million of the state's 167.5 million acres have burned in 19,896 fires, according to Inciweb, a fire-tracking website run by state and federal agencies. The state Forest Service responded to 19 new fires Sunday involving 1,099 acres of land, including new large files in Harrison and Rusk counties. The state said the 40,548-acre Bear Creek fire in Cass County was 80 percent contained. It has destroyed 28 homes. The Riley Road fire was reported as 75 percent contained on Monday. The fire has destroyed 59 homes, the Texas Forest Service reported. Authorities were on the lookout Monday for possibly three monkeys that may have been released or escaped during the fire. One of the monkeys bit a state game warden on the thumb on Sunday, said Mike Cox, a spokesman for the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. The bite wasn't serious, but authorities are still keeping an eye out for the monkey gang, Cox said. While some residents expressed concern about hungry primates roaming the charred ruins, the incident gave others in battered Texas a much needed bit of comic relief. ""Has anyone noticed if the monkeys have wings?"" a poster to the Grimes County Facebook page asked in jest, referring to the villainous hench-monkeys for the Wicked Witch of the West in the ""The Wizard of Oz."" ""If I see flying monkeys then I know I can click the heels on my red ruby encrusted flip flops and this nightmare will all go away,"" the poster said. Authorities said although the monkeys -- which appeared to be of the rhesus species -- had been seen in the area, they did not know where the monkeys came from. CNN's Chandler Friedman contributed to this report.","NEW: Authorities look for missing monkeys possibly released during fire .

"(CNN) -- Reigning world champion Marc Marquez may not be 100% fit for the MotoGP 2014 season opener in Qatar but that doesn't seem to matter. A broken fibula in his right leg sustained while dirt-bike riding last month didn't appear to slow the 21-year-old Spaniard down at all in Saturday's qualifying session as he stormed to pole for Sunday's race. He left it late though, waiting until the last lap to put in the fastest qualifying time of one minute, 54.507 seconds, edging out compatriot Alvaro Bautista. Britain's Bradley Smith, who was riding a Yamaha Tech3, finished third. Ducati's Andrea Dovizioso finished fourth while 2012 world champion Jorge Lorenzo was fifth fastest on his Yamaha. Honda's Dani Pedrosa will start Sunday's race from sixth. Nine-time world champion Valentino Rossi starts on the fourth row. ""I'm very happy, after the injury and the loss of half the pre-season,"" Marquez said. ""It's very important to be here on the front row. But the pole position makes me happy. ""Tomorrow is the most important; it will be very hard as there are many riders on the same pace,"" he added. ""Physical condition will also be difficult for me, as I don't have full power in my leg so I have to use more arms and this is quite hard over long a distance."" Marquez prevailed over compatriot Lorenzo in last year's championship, clinching the title at the final race of the season in Valencia.

"(CNN) -- The true test of patience is peering for hours into a microscope waiting for a rotifer to open its mouth so you can snap a quick photo. That's exactly what Rogelio Moreno did to win this year's Nikon Small World competition, an annual event, now in its 40th year, which applauds the artistic merit and skill in microscopic images. For those who don't know, rotifers are tiny aquatic animals typically 200 to 500 micrometers long, that's less than half a millimeter, at best. They're found in fresh water and moist soil, where they linger in raindrops feeding on phytoplankton and algae filtered through the crown of cilia -- which is also called a corona -- around their mouths. ""I have always wanted to capture an image where the rotifer show the complete corona in focus, so when I saw the heart-shaped corona I had a feeling it would be a very special picture,"" Moreno told CNN. Moreno started taking microscopic images in his spare time just five years ago. He's self-taught and, by day, works as a computer system programmer. Moreno has won a place every year since he started entering the competition three years ago. ""To take this image, I used a flash to freeze the movement of the rotifer and differential interference contrast (DIC) to show the beautiful details and the blue background,"" he said. The photo was deemed the most striking and skillful of more than 1,200 entries from 79 countries. The top five images this year zoomed in on a calcite crystal, jumping spider eyes, a caterpillar proleg and cells of a bovine pulmonary artery -- proving that beauty can be found just about anywhere.

"(CNN) -- Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton stormed to his third pole position in four races at qualifying for the Chinese Grand Prix on Saturday. The Briton, who will be hunting down a third successive win this season on Sunday, finished just over half-a-second ahead of Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo posting a time of one minute, 53.860 seconds in the third qualifying session (Q3). Ricciardo's teammate, Sebastian Vettel finished third with Mercedes's driver Nico Rosberg joining his compatriot on the second row of the grid after a wet qualifying session at the Shanghai International Circuit. ""It's so slippery out there,"" Hamilton said. ""Trying to find the grip, obviously not making mistakes on your lap, and really putting it together, especially when you have these guys pushing you. ""So, it was a tough session. I really enjoyed it. The car was feeling great. We always have stuff we can improve but the team have done a great job this weekend. A good position for the race and I hope we can follow through tomorrow,"" Hamilton added. Ricciardo, who had his disqualification from the Australian Grand Prix confirmed in the week, was pleased with second place after admitting to finding the conditions tough going. ""To be honest, I struggled a bit throughout the session, at least personally I didn't feel like I was getting on top of the conditions but then the last set of inters right at the end of Q3 we managed to get a bit more out of it and I put a good lap together, so pretty pleased to be on the front row,"" the Australian said. Fernando Alonso, who won this race last season, found his Ferrari still off the pace and had to settle for fifth. And it was another disappointing day for the Spaniard's teammate Kimi Raikkonen -- the Finn failed to make it into Q3 and will start from 11th on Sunday. All eyes are on new Ferrari team principal Marco Mattiacci who has been tasked with reversing the fortunes of the Italian team after a poor start to the season. The 43-year-old, who replaced outgoing Stefano Domenicali, who quit as team boss on Monday, told reporters he was ""extremely motivated"" to succeed following Friday's practise session. Further down the grid, the Williams pair of Felipe Massa and Valtteri Bottas continued their promising start to 2014 finishing six and seventh respectively.

"Asuncion, Paraguay (CNN) -- Paraguay installed new top military commanders, but President Fernando Lugo, who had ordered the change in leadership, was not present for the ceremony. Lugo's absence Thursday morning attracted attention given his administration's silence on the sudden change in the leadership of the country's army, air force and navy. The president's decision to replace the top brass came a day after he publicly dismissed rumors about a military coup. Brig. Gen. Bartolome Ramon Pineda Ortiz was named as the new army commander. Brig. Gen. Hugo Gilberto Aranda Chamorro and Rear Adm. Egberto Emerito Orie Benegas took over the top posts at the air force and navy, respectively. The announcement came from the armed forces, not the president's office. Cibar Benitez, commander of the armed forces, was the only top leader to retain his post. Other changes would be forthcoming in the lower ranks, said Benitez at the swearing-in ceremony, but he denied there was any truth to talk of a coup. Paraguay's history is filled with unstable transitions of power since it emerged from dictatorship in 1989. Although there hasn't been a coup since that year, there were attempted coups in 1996 and 2000, and President Raul Cubas resigned amid controversy in 1999. The military shakeup is the third since Lugo took office. The former Catholic bishop was elected to a five-year term last year. His victory brought an end to six decades of one-party rule in Paraguay, but the honeymoon did not last long. In April, Lugo admitted that he fathered a child while he was still a priest and that he may have fathered more. The revelation, which came as a shock to most, hurt his political image. Calls for his resignation began, and have continued as Lugo has struggled to push reforms through a majority-opposition legislature. Journalist Sanie Lopez Garelli contributed to this report.","Other changes forthcoming in lower ranks, says commander of armed forces .

"(CNN) -- It's a warning which will reverberate around the Formula One paddock with more gusto than the sport's much derided V6 engine. Nico Rosberg, says the sport's dominant team ""definitely hasn't peaked yet despite Mercedes having won all four of the season's opening races. ""At the beginning of the season we had the car we developed in the winter and now we're going to keep on pushing,"" championship leader Rosberg told CNN's The Circuit. ""It has been three weeks since the last race and the development rate is so fast. We have 600 people back in the factory working crazy hours to make this car faster in every single race. ""For example, from the start of the season to the end of the season, you can have a car that is 1.5 seconds quicker by the end just with new parts on the car. ""It's a good period for the team at the moment. We really have the momentum, a quick car, the best car in F1 -- the Silver Arrow."" The Mercedes car's next outing is at Sunday's Spanish Grand Prix, providing Rosberg and teammate Lewis Hamilton, who already has three race victories to his name this season, the opportunity to make another giant statement of intent. Hamilton and Rosberg have finished first and second respectively in each of the past three races, but the German is hoping he won't have to play second fiddle to the 2008 world champion for a fourth consecutive race. ""At the moment, it has been all about the battle against my teammate but of course, we're all conscious that the other teams are flat out pushing trying to close the gap and we need to keep doing a good job to stay ahead,"" added Rosberg. ""I'm just looking forward to the next race and getting the most out of it. It's a tough battle with my teammate at the moment and I need to try and come out on top in Barcelona."" While Mercedes has enjoyed a stellar start to the 2014 season, there is no sense of complacency, with Ferrari, Red Bull and Lotus all striving to produce improved performances in Catalonia to prevent the drivers' title becoming a two-man race. ""The first European round of the year always provides a prime opportunity for teams to arrive with improvements to their cars,"" Mercedes executive director Toto Wolff told the F1 website. ""Of course, we are no different to any other team in that respect and our aim must be to increase the advantage we enjoyed at the last race in China. ""We have seen already that our rivals are relentless in their efforts to close the gap. As a team, it is up to us to rise to that challenge -- to take that relentless mentality to an even greater extent than those around us. ""If we are to build a sustained level of success in this sport, any small advantage must be seen as a platform upon which to build a bigger advantage.

"Beijing (CNN) -- Bo Xilai, once seen as one of the rising stars of Chinese politics, has been removed from his prominent provincial post after a scandal involving one of his key deputies. Zhang Dejiang, a Chinese vice premier, will replace Bo as Communist Party chief of Chongqing, the biggest metropolis in southwestern China, the official news agency Xinhua reported Thursday. The announcement deals a crippling blow to Bo, a polarizing figure in Chinese politics who many observers had previously considered to be a future contender for the top leadership roles. In recent years, Bo had pushed a series of aggressive political campaigns in Chongqing, including the ""dahei,"" or anti-gangs initiative, which targeted mafia-like criminal groups. The approach divided opinions in China, with some lauding its effectiveness and others criticizing it as heavy handed. But in recent weeks, his foothold near the summit of the Chinese Communist Party started to crumble. Wang Lijun, the man who helped Bo spearhead the anti-criminal crackdown, was also at the heart of the scandal that appears to have brought him down. Wang is a decorated policeman whom Bo appointed as Chongqing's police chief. Following the well publicized anti-crime push, Wang became a vice mayor of the city. But in early February, he set off a frenzy of intrigue and speculation by entering the U.S. consulate in Chengdu, six hours' drive from Chongqing, and staying there for one day. Rumors began to circulate that he had tried to defect. What really transpired in the consulate remains unclear. The United States downplayed it as a scheduled visit and said that Wang left of his own volition. But the Chinese authorities subsequently placed him under investigation. The Chinese prime minister, Wen Jiabao, hinted at the level of displeasure in Beijing about the affair during a news conference Wednesday. He said the Chongqing authorities must ""seriously"" reflect on and draw lessons from the Wang incident. ""As far as the result of the investigation and how this matter will be handled are concerned, an answer must be given to the people and the result of the investigation should be able to stand the test of law and history,"" Wen said after the conclusion of the annual parliamentary session in Beijing. His comments now appear to have been an early indication of the fate awaiting Bo. ""The news came faster than I expected,"" said Wenran Jiang, political science professor at the University of Alberta. But Bo's removal was ""not surprising, given Wen Jiabao's tone,"" he said. Bo, 62, had served as Chongqing party chief since November 2007. Before that, he was party chief of Liaoning Province, where huge state-run corporations were concentrated. He also served as minister of commerce and mayor of Dalian, a progressive coastal city in northeastern China. Bo and his successor, Zhang, are members of the policy-making political bureau of the Communist Party of China. Zhang, 65, is a former party secretary of the economically powerful southern province of Guangdong. CNN's Tim Schwartz contributed to this report.","Bo Xilai, a prominent Chinese provincial leader, has been dogged by a scandal .

"(CNN) -- Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg picked up where they left off in Malaysia completing another dominant day for Mercedes at Friday's practice session in Bahrain ahead of Sunday's Grand Prix. The pair took the Formula One team's first one-two for 59 years at Kuala Lumpur's Sepang's International Circuit last weekend, and are on course to repeat the feat if Friday's practice is any guide. Hamilton finished the day top of the standings at the floodlit Sakhir circuit with a best lap time of one minute 34.325 seconds with German teammate Rosberg 0.365 seconds behind. ""The track temperature was 38-40 degrees and then this afternoon was a lot cooler, about ten degrees, so it's just really not trying to panic and react to the change,"" Hamilton told Sky Sports News. ""We struggled a bit on the tires as everyone did."" Rosberg was satisfied with second place and welcomed the new night racing in Bahrain. ""It's spectacular. Even on track it's very impressive. It's good, especially for TV viewers. It's going to be great to watch,"" Rosberg said. ""Visibility wise it's very similar to Singapore. It's a bit more difficult in the dark with the glare."" He was also buoyed by the positive update on the health of his compatriot Michael Schumacher. The former F1 star has been in a medically-induced coma for over three months following a skiing accident, but is now starting to have ""moments of consciousness,"" his agent Sabine Kehm said Friday. ""It's fantastic to hear,"" Rosberg said. ""I am very happy, as is everybody else in the paddock. We know that his family would be very careful before releasing such good news. I hope he will continue to progress."" The German currently heads Hamilton in the Drivers' Championship after winning the opening race in Melbourne and coming second behind his British teammate last weekend. Mercedes lead the Constructors' Championship with 68 points ahead of McLaren who have 43 points with Ferrari currently third. Fernando Alonso confirmed the Italian team's current overall rank completing the third fastest lap in Friday's practice, 1.035 seconds behind Hamilton. Red Bull continue to struggle with the new F1 regulations. Daniel Ricciardo and reigning world champion Sebastian Vettel finished 14th and 10th respectively in the first practice before recovering to fourth and seventh under the floodlights in session two.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Pope Benedict XVI on Wednesday addressed issues ranging from the sex abuse scandal in the Roman Catholic Church to the easy availability of pornography to the ""alarming decrease"" in Catholic marriages in the United States. The pope arrives to address U.S. bishops in the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception. He spoke at a prayer service with U.S. bishops at Washington's Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, the largest Roman Catholic church in North America. Benedict said the sexual abuse of children by priests has caused a ""deep shame"" and called it ""gravely immoral behavior."" ""Many of you have spoken to me of the enormous pain that your communities have suffered when clerics have betrayed ... their obligations,"" he told the bishops. Responding to the situation has not been easy and was sometimes very badly handled, the pope admitted.  Watch the pope address the issue » . ""It is vitally important that the vulnerable are always shielded from souls who would cause harm,"" he said. The pope then turned his attention to a different concern involving kids. ""What does it mean to speak of child protection when pornography and violence can be viewed in so many homes through media widely available today?"" he asked. Benedict urged the media and entertainment industry to take part in a ""moral renewal."" Earlier Wednesday, President Bush, first lady Laura Bush and more than 13,500 spectators welcomed Benedict in an elaborate ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House. In remarks greeting the pope to the White House, Bush called the United States ""a nation of prayer."" Bush was interrupted by applause as he said, ""In a world where some treat life as something to be debased and discarded, we need your message that all human life is sacred and that each of us is willed."" Benedict responded by praising the role of religion in the United States. ""From the dawn of the republic, America's quest for freedom has been guided by the conviction that the principles governing political and social life are intimately linked to a moral order based on the dominion of God the creator,"" he said.  Watch Benedict talk about his hopes for the trip » . Earlier, a U.S. Marine Corps band performed the national anthem of the Holy See as well as ""The Star-Spangled Banner."" A fife and drum corps in Colonial costumes also played tunes, including ""Yankee Doodle,"" and soprano Kathleen Battle sang ""The Lord's Prayer."" The day, with perfect spring weather, was also the pontiff's 81st birthday.  After the ceremony concluded, the crowd, led by Battle, serenaded Benedict with ""Happy Birthday"" as he smiled from a White House balcony.  Watch a priest who has known Benedict for years tell what he's like » . Guests on the South Lawn included Catholic clergy, ecumenical representatives, Catholic schoolchildren, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Sisters of the Poor and Knights of Columbus. Event planners faced an enormous demand for tickets for what White House press secretary Dana Perino called ""one of the largest arrival ceremonies ever held at the White House."" Following the ceremony, Bush and the pope had a one-on-one meeting in the Oval Office. The pope left the White House at about noon in his distinctive ""popemobile."" His massive motorcade moved slowly down the wide avenues of the U.S. capital to the Vatican Embassy, where the pope is staying. Crowds of enthusiastic spectators waved U.S. and Vatican flags and screamed as the pontiff rode past. A smiling Benedict arrived Tuesday at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland to cheers from a crowd of invited guests. The pontiff was greeted by Bush, the first lady and their daughter Jenna, each of whom shook his hand. It was believed to be the first time an American president has greeted a world dignitary on arrival at Andrews. It marks Benedict's first visit to the United States as pope.   Watch how the pope's visit could affect the presidential campaign » . Security will be tight during the six-day visit, with 27 state, local and federal agencies protecting the pope as he meets with religious leaders, celebrates Mass at two baseball stadiums and makes his way around in the popemobile. Benedict faces no specific threats, according to the FBI, but a March audio message from Osama bin Laden mentioned the pontiff. The centerpiece of the trip's Washington leg will be Thursday's Mass at Nationals Park, a new baseball stadium where 46,000 people will gather to see the pope. Everyone must go through metal detectors on entering, and nearby roads and bridges will be closed. Temporary flight restrictions will be in place over the stadium, and a 1½-mile section of the adjacent Anacostia River will be closed during the Mass. Benedict will travel to New York on Friday and address the U.N. General Assembly, linking the visit to the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. He'll celebrate Mass on Sunday morning at Yankee Stadium.  Where will the pope be? » . One of the stated goals of the pope's visit is to energize the U.S. Catholic community with its estimated 70 million members.

""According to information and testimonies received, they were interrogated and tortured with the goal that they admitted guilt in the commission of homicide and that they were members of a gang,"" Mexico's National Human Rights Commission said in a statement Sunday. The commission's statement described the situation as an ""abuse of power"" in the violence-plagued border city. The five people, arrested in August 2010, should receive reparations from police for human rights violations that require physical and psychological treatment, the commission said. Mexican government officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

"Khartoum, Sudan (CNN) -- Militants captured 70 construction workers, including Chinese nationals, in Sudan's volatile South Kordofan state, military officials said Sunday. The group attacked the construction site in a remote area Saturday and destroyed equipment, said Alsawarmi Khalid, spokesman for the Sudanese armed forces. Khalid blamed the attacks on the Sudan People's Liberation Movement -North, a rebel force in the border region with neighboring South Sudan. The Sudanese army is pursuing the kidnappers, the spokesman said. China confirmed the incident but did not say how many of its workers had been taken. ""The Chinese Foreign Ministry and the Chinese Embassy to Sudan have initiated an emergency response to the incident,"" Foreign Ministry Spokesman Liu Weimin said, in quotes carried by the state-run Xinhua agency. ""Currently, the Sudanese government is doing their utmost to locate and rescue the missing Chinese nationals and has enhanced protection for other Chinese nationals in Sudan,"" he added. South Sudan became the world's newest nation last year after decades of conflict with the north. International concern has grown over the violence in South Kordofan and nearby Blue Nile states, which has forced hundreds of thousands to flee their homes. The region is a Sudan territory, but straddles Sudan and South Sudan's ethnic and political lines. China is Sudan's largest trading partner, while Sudan is China's third-largest trading partner in Africa. According to the Chinese foreign ministry, trade between the two countries reached $8.63 billion in 2010, an increase of 35.1% compared to the previous year. The close bilateral cooperation is mainly driven by oil exports from Sudan, which is among the top oil suppliers for China. Linking aid, trade and investment, Beijing's business model in Africa involves building extensive infrastructure projects and granting loans in exchange for access to natural resources, trade opportunities and expansion into new markets. Last year, Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir was given the red carpet treatment when he visited Beijing -- a trip that included the signing of a memorandum of understanding between the Sudanese government and China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), China's largest oil company, to ""deepen cooperation in the oil and gas field."" But human rights groups criticized China for the visit because al-Bashir is wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for alleged war atrocities during the civil war in Sudan -- allegations he denies.

"(CNN) -- NBA legend Bill Russell was arrested this week for allegedly bringing a loaded gun to Sea-Tac International Airport in Seattle, police said. Russell, 79, was arrested Wednesday and issued a state citation for having a weapon in a prohibited area of the airport, said Perry Cooper, a Port of Seattle Police Department spokesman. Russell was issued a citation and released. He had a .38-caliber Smith & Wesson handgun in a forbidden area of the airport, said Lisette Garcia, a Transportation Security Administration spokeswoman. The gun was found during a screening of carry-on bags at a checkpoint, the TSA said. ""Firearms, ammunition, firearm parts and realistic replicas of firearms are always prohibited in carry-on baggage. However, these items can be transported in checked baggage provided the traveler declares them to the airline during the ticket counter check-in process,"" a TSA statement said. Along with the state citation, Russell could be fined up to $7,500, the TSA said. The 6-foot-9 former basketball star is best known for being the driving force behind an amazing string of consecutive NBA championships while playing for the Boston Celtics. He won 11 championships in his 13-year career that ended in 1969. During two years of his career with the Celtics he also served as player and coach, becoming the NBA's first African-American head coach. In 2011, he was part of a group 15 people awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, America's highest civilian honor.

"Greenville, South Carolina (CNN) -- Lana Kuykendall -- the South Carolina woman infected with flesh-eating bacteria shortly after giving birth to twins more than two months ago -- will go home soon, possibly as early as Tuesday, doctors said Monday. ""She'll be heading home this week,"" said Dr. Spence Taylor, vice president for academics at Greenville Hospital System. ""She's making a great recovery."" Kuykendall, who clasped hands with her husband, Darren, as she spoke to CNN senior medical correspondent Elizabeth Cohen, said her recovery has had ups and downs. ""I've had my moments where I've had myself a good cry, but then you just go on,"" she told CNN. Darren Kuykendall said family and friends have been caring for the twins, named Ian and Abigail. Dr. Kevin Kopera, medical director for Roger C. Peace Rehabilitation Hospital, said Lana Kuykendall wanted an aggressive rehabilitation approach. ""That meant three hours of therapy a day at the minimum,"" he said. ""I initially thought she would be with us for four to six weeks and she's leaving on day 26 (Tuesday). It took a lot of blood, sweat and tears -- literally."" Lana Kuykendall, wearing a blue T-shirt that read ""FAITH HOPE LANA,"" said the day after getting the babies home from the hospital she noticed what looked like a bruise on her leg. When Kuykendall, a nurse and paramedic, inspected it closer she thought it might be a blood clot, and she had her husband, a firefighter and EMT, take her to the hospital. ""Fortunately she had the good sense to notice this was more serious than usual,"" said epidemiologist Dr. Bill Kelly. Doctors there outlined the spot with a pen and saw the discolored area move. They took her to surgery, while one of the doctors told Darren Kuykendall how serious her condition actually was. Flesh-eating bacteria explained . Lana Kuykendall said she doesn't dwell on why this happened to her. A friend of the Kuykendalls' had a similar case in 2007. That showed her it is an opportunistic disease, she said. ""There's no point in asking, 'Why me?' "" she told CNN. ""It just happens."" She still faces months of in-home and then outpatient rehab, Kopera said. Kuykendall was diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis on May 11, four days after giving birth, and taken to Greenville Memorial Hospital. She has undergone more than 20 surgical procedures, including skin grafts and reconstructive surgery. But she did not require any amputations, as recently occurred in the case of 24-year-old Aimee Copeland of Georgia, who lost her hands, a leg and a foot as a result of the infection. Family readies home for Aimee Copeland's return . A number of bacteria, which are common in the environment but rarely cause serious infections, can lead to the disease. When the bacteria get into the bloodstream -- such as through a cut -- doctors typically move aggressively to excise even healthy tissue near the infection site in hopes of ensuring none of the dangerous bacteria remain. The disease attacks and destroys healthy tissue and is fatal in about 20% of cases, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. According to Dr. William Schaffner, chairman of the Department of Preventive Medicine at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, fewer than 250 such cases occur each year in the United States, though estimates are imprecise because doctors aren't required to report the cases to health authorities.

"Kearney, Missouri (CNN) -- A controversial gun measure won't become law in Missouri after a push to override the governor's veto fell one vote short of approval in the state's Senate on Wednesday. The measure, HB 436, would have essentially nullified federal gun laws in the state. Senators voted 22-12 in favor of overriding Gov. Jay Nixon's veto, but the vote fell just short of the two thirds majority required to pass. Earlier Wednesday, the state's House of Representatives voted 109-49 in favor of overriding the veto. If it had passed, the law would have technically not only let residents own a machine gun but also arrested federal agents if they tried to take it away. The bill also would have made it illegal for anyone to publish any information about a gun owner. The legislation passed earlier this year in Missouri's Republican-led House and Senate but vetoed by Nixon, a Democrat. Nixon argued that the legislation violated a provision in the U.S. Constitution called the Supremacy Clause. The Supremacy Clause gives preference to federal laws over state laws. Lawmakers had argued that what they were proposing was not only constitutional but essential to protect the rights of gun owners. ""There are people saying this is the same as seceding from the Union,"" said gun owner Kevin Jamison. ""Missouri did not secede from the Union in 1862, and it does not do so by passing this law."" Colorado recall a proxy in national gun control debate . What the bill said . ""This bill doesn't put one new gun on the street,"" said State Rep. Doug Funderburk, a Republican. ""It strictly says that Missouri is going to protect the Second Amendment rights of Missourians."" By superseding federal regulations, House Bill 436 would have made it a criminal offense to enforce background checks or to publish the name and address of a gun owner in the state. It would also have technically allowed citizens to own a machine gun, which is banned under federal regulations, according to the governor's office. And it would have nullified federal gun laws and allowed citizens to take legal action against officers who try to enforce them. Gun permits for the blind? Iowa grants them, stirs debate . Opponents worry . Ohio, Minnesota and Texas have pursued similar bills in recent months in reaction to attempts at federal gun control legislation after the December shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. Opponents worry such laws could all but end any joint operations between local and federal law enforcement agencies when it comes to taking guns off the streets. St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson has been one of its most vocal opponents. ""(We are) basically saying to criminals, 'OK criminals, it's OK to come to Missouri. We won't prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law,' "" he said.

"JERUSALEM (CNN) -- Two Israeli television channels have dropped plans to air full-length versions of telephone interviews they conducted with the man who assassinated Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. Late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin holds a press conference in 1994. In the wake of a torrent of public criticism, Israeli broadcast channels 2 and 10 said they decided not to air the entire interviews each did this week with convicted killer Yigal Amir. Both channels teased the interviews in their news broadcasts Thursday evening in advance of the upcoming 13th anniversary of Rabin's murder. In the excerpt aired Thursday by Channel 10, Amir explained, in part, how the notion of killing Rabin came to him at a wedding he attended. Amir said Rabin was one of the guests at the wedding. ""He sat by the table with only a bodyguard next to him,"" Amir said. ""If I were to shake his hand, I could have easily shot him. I was in eye contact with him; I was inside with a gun right next to him. I saw that it was easy, and I said to myself that I will regret not having killed him in a couple of years."" Amir also claimed he was influenced by rightist Israeli politicians Ariel Sharon, Rafael Eitan, and Rehavam Ze'evi -- ""all those who understand the military; who said that the agreement (the Oslo Accords) would bring catastrophe. You do not need a rabbi for this."" The Israeli Prisons Authority said it was unaware that Amir had done the interviews, which require prior departmental permission. As a result, Amir has been moved to a higher-security prison where his phone calls, family visits, and conjugal visits have been revoked, according to a Prisons Authority spokesman. On November 4, 1995, Amir shot Rabin as Rabin was leaving a rally in Tel Aviv in support of the Oslo Accords, which set out a plan for a permanent peace between Israel and the Palestinians.","The Israeli broadcasters say they decided not to air the entire interviews .

"(The Frisky) -- There are certain people you expect to preach abstinence -- for example, your parents and that sex-ed teacher in high school who traumatized you with an STD slideshow. But you might not expect to hear it from Ms. No Pants herself, Lady Gaga. But at a recent event for M.A.C's Viva Glam, Lady Gaga said, ""I can't believe I'm saying this -- don't have sex.

"(CNN) -- The vigilantes came to violence-torn towns with a simple pitch: Join us and fight back before the cartel kills you. For some in the western state of Michoacan, long a flashpoint in Mexico's drug war, it was an offer they couldn't refuse. They toted guns and called themselves self-defense groups as they patrolled the streets, claiming they were forced to fight the Knights Templar cartel themselves because the state had failed to protect them. They took over several communities and sent a clear message to cartel members and authorities: Keep out. But this week, the Mexican government stepped in, sending federal forces to the region and ordering the vigilante groups to lay down their weapons. The smoldering situation has become a major problem for President Enrique Peña Nieto's government, which has vowed to reduce drug violence. In some areas, it hasn't gone smoothly, with both sides refusing to back down in tense standoffs. Mexican soldiers clashed with self-defense group members Tuesday in the town of Antunez, killing at least one person. And even as federal troops patrolled the city of Apatzingan, tensions ran high after a pharmacy burned down in a suspected arson attack just blocks away from City Hall on Wednesday. By Thursday, Mexican authorities said they'd gained control of 20 municipalities in the region. But a top security official said he couldn't set a date guaranteeing when the state would be safe. Some vigilante groups have vowed not to hand over their guns until cartel leaders are captured. ""We want them to go rescue the towns where the people are still being massacred by organized crime,"" said Estanislao Beltran, a spokesman for the self-defense groups. ""When there is peace and security in our state, we will give up our weapons."" Residents, meanwhile, told CNNMexico they're caught in the middle of spiraling violence that shows no sign of slowing. And some observers say it's not clear the government crackdown is working. ""Federal authorities, instead of imposing order, instead of rescuing the cities, they are more like referees,"" Jose Antonio Ortega, president of the Citizens Council for Public Safety and Criminal Justice, told CNNMexico this week. ""They are watching the civil war in Michoacan."" And the situation could have consequences beyond the state's borders, security analyst Alejandro Hope said. It's possible, he said, that the phenomenon of vigilante groups could spread. ""It is a real risk,"" he told CNN en Español. ""It is a scenario that should worry the people in charge of the country's security policies."" Resident: 'We do not know who to believe' One Michoacan resident, who asked not to be identified out of concern for his safety, said a self-defense group gave residents few options but to support them when they swooped into the town of Tancitaro, where much of the local economy depends on avocado orchards. ""The words of the self-defense groups were very clear: 'If you do not arm yourselves, you could be killed by the Knights Templar.' This was the central point,"" he recalled in an interview with CNNMexico this week. And even with an increase in government forces in the area, he said, it's a situation that isn't likely to stop any time soon, with so many decentralized groups spread across so many parts of the region. ""We think that this is going to last for months, because there is not just one person who says, 'We are going to hand over our weapons to the Army,'"" he said. ""People are very afraid. We do not know who to believe. The self-defense groups tell us one thing, and the military tells us something else."" But in the meantime, he said, vigilantes have set up roadblocks around the town. And the town's church bells have become a signal, he said, summoning vigilantes to stop cartel members from entering. Analyst: Problems paved the way for vigilantes . Self-defense groups have also surged in parts of the neighboring state of Guerrero, where government troops have struggled to put a stop to cartel violence. ""We think the government is very timid, very slow,"" Sergio Mejia, the head of an association of restaurant and business owners in Acapulco, told CNN last year. ""If there is no immediate response, it leaves us no choice but to join the fight."" Several factors in Michoacan have paved the way for vigilante groups, Hope said -- especially the nature of the primary cartel operating there, the Knights Templar. It's a group with a great focus on territory, Hope said. ""And they tend to be much more involved in extortion, in robbery, and in different kinds of kidnapping, so they generate a lot more resistance than a traditional group dedicated to international drug trafficking,"" Hope said. Today's problems started in the state at least a decade ago, said Julio Hernandez Granados, a former Michoacan government spokesman. ""There were many years of abandonment in many communities,"" he told CNN en Español. That allowed drug cartels to infiltrate, strengthening their grip on daily life and threatening those who didn't obey. ""These criminal organizations would not subsist if these circumstances did not exist,"" Granados said. ""With many young people lacking education, lacking employment opportunities, they find the only path ... is to work for criminal groups."" Concerns groups could have a darker aim . Some locals view the vigilantes as heroes. Others see them as villains and have responded to their arrival by destroying property and setting vehicles ablaze to create fiery road blockades to stop them. In the past year, Hope said, even federal officials have been ""schizophrenic"" about how they approach the groups, sometimes cracking down on them and other times describing them as allies. Critics suggest the vigilante groups contain some criminals from rival gangs who are using them as a means to win more territory. Leaders of the groups have consistently denied such accusations, saying their only aim is to fight cartels and protect public safety. But Alfredo Castillo, appointed by the federal government this week to be a new commissioner heading up security in the state, offered an ominous warning Thursday. In an interview with MVS Radio, he noted that the Familia Michoacana cartel -- which eventually splintered and led to the formation of the Knights Templar -- also started out as a group that aimed to defend the state's residents in a push to kick out the Zetas. The newly formed self-defense groups, he said, could become as ruthless as the cartels they claim to oppose. ""You can start out with a genuine purpose,"" he said. ""But when you start taking control, making decisions and feeling authority ... you run the risk of reaching that point."" CNNMexico.com and CNN en Español's Rey Rodriguez and Fernando del Rincon contributed to this report.","Mexico orders vigilante groups to lay down their weapons .

"(CNN) -- As admitted NSA leaker Edward Snowden bides his time, presumably in Moscow, President Barack Obama expresses hope that other countries will follow the letter of the law and turn over the former national security contractor to the United States. Truth is, there aren't many real options for the United States in getting Snowden back to face espionage charges. Here are actions the United States could pursue and why they most likely wouldn't work: . Demands for Snowden to return . Obama risks his and national prestige by directly calling for a country to release Snowden to the United States and to have those demands fall on deaf ears. ""It's dangerous for the president to become overexposed,"" said Anthony Cordesman, chairman of strategic studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""If he takes a stand, if he makes threats, if he calls on other countries to essentially return something like Snowden, the problem is he can compromise his prestige, that of the country, and basically be exposed to all kinds of statements about free speech,"" he said. Cordesman said there's not much to gain and lots to lose by making a high-profile push to get Snowden back in the United States to face charges. ""We have forced him effectively into exile -- there's not much to be gained from pushing this issue, particularly if you cannot be certain of success,"" he said. ""The harder you press, the more you publicize this issue, the more you have effectively put America's prestige at stake."" Cordesman said the effort to get him back may hinge on what Snowden may know, if anything new. ""What does he know about sources and methods, which are not really of interest to the media or the Congress or the American public. But often very small amounts of information he may have as to how the intelligence community operates can be put in the context of other counter intelligence efforts in countries like Russia and China,"" he said. Snowden keeps much of the world guessing . Extradition . While it's true that the United States has treaties and agreements with Russia and other countries, those agreements aren't always followed. After the U.S. charged Snowden with espionage and revoked his passport, Hong Kong still allowed Snowden to board a flight for Russia. Officials later said they hadn't been informed that his passport had been revoked. ""This is much more of a political and diplomatic matter than it is a legal matter,"" CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said. ""In an ordinary case, sure, you need a passport to get around. But here, where this case is causing increasing embarrassment for the United States, governments that want the United States to be embarrassed are only too happy to waive some of the technical legal rules."" Toobin said the matter is going to be decided by whatever government controls Snowden. ""He is now in Russia, a country that has very frosty relations with the United States now. He's thinking of going to Cuba, to Ecuador. It's obvious why he's picking those countries, because those are countries that have frosty or even worse relationships with the United States. ""So it's really not a question of the legal -- the legal rights of the United States to extradite him, it's a question of do these governments want to turn him over. He's in a country that doesn't want to turn him over, at least not now. And he wants to get another country that doesn't want to do it,"" Toobin said. Interactive: En route with Snowden . Diplomacy . Quiet negotiation between the United States and Russia, or wherever Snowden ends up, is the most likely scenario, experts say. ""It would probably be that there would be some arrangement through whatever country he ends up in where the United States, through diplomatic means, offers some kind of quid pro quo, some kind of guarantee as to his status and how he will be prosecuted and there is essentially the same kind of implied debt as there is when we exchange spies,"" Cordesman said. ""It has to be taken at the diplomatic level, there have to be quiet quid pro quos, and the more they are kept from the media, the better,"" he said. That's probably already going on behind the scenes because there is a better chance of getting Snowden back from Russia than from some of the other countries in which he's reportedly seeking asylum. Snowden's no-show leaves reporters stuck on plane . Military action . Highly unlikely, experts say. The U.S. military could take the extraordinary stop of trying to intercept Snowden's flight and force it to land or if it entered U.S. air space, air traffic controllers could tell the pilot to land. ""That would create a colossal international incident and I just don't believe the president wants to do that,"" said Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University. Why would Snowden head for Ecuador?","Demands, diplomacy, extradition are among options to get Snowden back to face charges .
Russia may be best option; other countries mentioned have difficult relations with the United States .
Snowden flew from Hong Kong to Moscow; His passport has been revoked .
Military option of forcing any plane carrying Snowden to land is unlikely, expert says ."
"(CNN) -- Venezuela continues to nationalize private businesses, with President Hugo Chavez announcing late Monday that the government will take over two U.S.-owned Owens-Illinois glass-manufacturing plants. Chavez also ordered an environmental investigation at the sites, the state-run Agencia Venezolana de Noticias reported. Owens-Illinois did not know what will happen next, a spokeswoman said Tuesday. ""We haven't received official word from the government yet,"" said spokeswoman Stephanie Johnston. Venezuelan military personnel were at the company's plant in Los Guayos, Johnston told CNN. No Venezuelan authorities were on the scene at the company's plant in Valera, Johnston said. ""Both plants continue to operate as usual,"" she said. Owens-Illinois Inc. says it is the world's leading glass container maker with more than 22,000 employees in 21 countries. The $7.1 billion company has global headquarters in Perrysburg, Ohio. Chavez, who has nationalized other industries and land holdings during his 11-year tenure, said he soon will announce the takeover of other foreign companies that have been ""exploiting the country's working class."" U.S. officials said Tuesday they were monitoring developments. ""We've seen the announcement and are following the situation closely,"" the State Department said. ""We would expect Venezuela to provide prompt, adequate and effective compensation for any expropriation of the investments of Owens-Illinois in accordance with international law."" Chavez nationalized a local unit of U.S. food giant Cargill last year. He previously has appropriated privately owned oil, telecommunications, power, cement and steel companies.

"(CNN) -- How cold is minus 20 degrees really? Cold enough to freeze an egg sunny-side up. Funda Ray was making breakfast in Hibbing, Minnesota, when she got an idea to demonstrate just how dramatically the temperature had dropped outside. ""I sprayed the cookie pan with Pam and broke an egg on it, and in half an hour, I had a frozen egg,"" she said. Her husband held up the egg, which she photographed and posted to CNN's iReport. The coldest weather so far this winter is creeping over the northern United States this week, the National Weather Service said, sending the temperature plunging below zero in Chicago for the first time in 711 days. Bitterly cold temperatures stretched from the Dakotas to New England, sweeping down into the Ohio Valley. Wind was a major issue in some places, with wind chill warnings and advisories in effect from North Dakota to West Virginia and on into parts of New England. Residents of Rugby, North Dakota, suffered through wind chills of 51 degrees below zero early Monday morning. The lowest temperatures were forecast to last into early Thursday. The cold snap triggered blinding snow in some areas Monday, spawning a number of traffic pileups in Ohio alone, including one fatal wreck involving 86 vehicles. One person died and 20 were taken to hospitals. Whiteout conditions caused by snow arriving off Lake Erie caused at least three more pileups -- one involving 52 cars, another with 25 vehicles, and a third, in which 23 motorists collided. No one died and no one sustained life-threatening injuries in these accidents, authorities said. More snow is predicted Tuesday for the eastern shores of Lake Michigan, Lake Erie and Lake Ontario as dry Arctic air absorbs water vapor off the lakes and dumps up to 3 feet of snow in places, forecasters warned, . The cold weather isn't only an annoyance, it can be dangerous. At 30 below zero Fahrenheit, frostbite can occur in as little as 10 minutes with the slightest winds, and in five minutes in a brisk breeze, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns. Newborns, the elderly and the homeless can quickly fall victim to hypothermia. ""Cold weather puts an extra strain on the heart,"" the CDC said, also noting that overexertion can become even more dangerous to those with heart conditions in the Arctic cold. Locals may be accustomed to winter days when going outside feels like stepping into a deep freezer, but Minnesota resident Patrick -- in a comment on a CNN story -- says it's good to be reminded of the potential dangers. ""This weather is deadly,"" he wrote, ""and last winter didn't even get close to this cold."" His solution to the glacial conditions? ""They should ship us all down to the tropics for the season.

"(CNN) -- A bright red cross marked the cover of a manifesto purportedly written by the suspect in last week's terror attacks in Norway. Nearly 6,000 miles away, Mexican police seized white robes emblazoned with the same symbol in a series of raids aimed at cracking down on one of the country's newest drug cartels. The Knights Templar -- warriors during the medieval holy wars known as the Crusades -- wore the cross insignia as they went into battle. Its red color represented the blood of Christian martyrs. The recent modern-day interpretations of the crusaders' ancient cause wouldn't sit well with the original Knights Templar, according to British historian and novelist Piers Paul Read. ""They'd have been horrified. ... They were very devout people,"" said Read, who detailed the knights' history in his book ""The Templars."" The knights began in the 12th century as a religious order fighting Muslims and protecting Christian pilgrims to the Holy Land. They mostly came from Western Europe and took strict vows of poverty, Read said. But over time, their organization amassed significant wealth and property, drawing ire from citizens and royalty alike. Amid accusations of heresy and devil-worship from France's king, the pope dissolved the order in 1312, Read said. The group's last leader was burned at the stake, but the story of the Knights Templar lives on, portrayed in films and popular fiction such as ""The Da Vinci Code."" Now authorities are investigating Norway attack suspect Anders Behring Breivik's purported manifesto, which claims that another group using the Knights Templar name intends to carry out ""shock attacks"" across Europe in a campaign to fight Islam and ""cultural Marxism."" Authorities accuse Breivik of killing at least 76 people when he set off a car bomb outside government buildings in Oslo last Friday, then ambushed an island political youth retreat. Breivik's lawyer told reporters that his client was ""a little bit surprised"" that he was able to pull off the bombing and shooting rampage, for which authorities say he has claimed responsibility. Separately, Mexican officials blame members of a new criminal organization that use the Knights Templar name for extorting business owners, decapitating and dismembering kidnapping victims and setting vehicles ablaze to block roads during shootouts with police. The original Templars' noble ideals and dramatic demise give them ""an aura of glamour and mystery,"" said Paul Crawford, an associate professor of ancient and medieval history at California University of Pennsylvania. Crawford and other historians argue that most fictional accounts of the group focus on unsubstantiated myths and conspiracy theories and that recent reappearances of the Knights Templar name in Norway and Mexico are just the latest attempts to manipulate their legacy. ""The drug gang and the murderer are trying to cloak the horror of their acts with the glamour and ideals of this religious order,"" Crawford said. Striving to be 'the perfect knight' The rambling, 1,500-page account that constitutes Breivik's purported manifesto includes excerpts from a Wikipedia entry about the Knights Templar and pictures of sword-wielding medieval knights wearing cloaks and armor. CNN has not independently confirmed that Breivik is the author of the manifesto, which bears his name and says it is intended to be circulated among sympathizers. The writer rails against Muslims and their growing presence in Europe, and calls for a European civil war to overthrow governments, end multiculturalism and execute ""cultural Marxists."" The author also makes numerous references to what he describes as a new incarnation of the Knights Templar, which he says was ""re-founded as a pan-European nationalist military order"" during an April 2002 meeting in London. The manifesto details necessary steps to become a ""Justiciar Knight,"" including pledging a Knights Templar oath. ""Any candidate prepared to walk this road must be willing to forfeit his materialistic ambitions and embrace voluntary poverty and martyrdom,"" Breivik writes. ""You are operating as a jury, judge and executioner on behalf of all free Europeans. ... There are situations in which cruelty is necessary, and refusing to apply necessary cruelty is a betrayal of the people whom you wish to protect,"" he continues. In a diary-like log of events leading up to last week's attacks, the manifesto's author says he is trying to set an example. ""I am one of many destroyers of cultural Marxism and as such; a hero of Europe, a savior of our people and of European Christendom -- by default. ... The Perfect Knight I have always strived to be,"" he writes. Crawford, the historian at California University of Pennsylvania, said such assertions show a clear misunderstanding of the Knights Templar. ""They were soldiers. They confronted Islam on the battlefield and Islam returned the favor. They did not, to the best of my knowledge, ever engage in massacres of unarmed combatants,"" he said. ""They were not terrorists and wouldn't have approved of it."" 'They want to demonstrate that they're courageous' The new Mexican cartel known as the Knights Templar announced its presence earlier this year. Banners hung in prominent locations -- and photographed by local media -- vowed to protect residents of the Mexican state of Michoacan. ""Our commitment to society will be to preserve order and prevent robbery, kidnapping and extortion, and protect the state from interventions by rival organizations,"" the signs said. For months, authorities and analysts said they suspected the Knights Templar had split from one of the nation's most notorious criminal organizations, La Familia Michoacana -- a cartel known for its mix of ruthless violence and religious ideology. Mexico's government said La Familia's founder, Nazario Moreno Gonzalez, was killed in clashes with authorities last year. In a dossier released as they announced his death in December, officials described Moreno as a ""spiritual leader"" who used religion to strengthen his stronghold. The government file said Moreno dubbed himself the ""savior of the people"" and outlined the cartel's philosophy in a ""bible"" provided to new recruits. The discovery earlier this month of the white robes with red crosses and handbooks outlining a code for the Knights Templar showed further evidence of a connection with La Familia, authorities said. ""Presumably they were indoctrinating their members,"" Mexican federal police spokesman Juan Carlos Buenrostro told CNNMexico.com. For the splinter group, choosing the Knights Templar name was no accident, said George W. Grayson, a professor of government at the College of William & Mary. ""They want to demonstrate that they're courageous and valiant, but at the same time they are generous,"" said Grayson, who studies Mexico's organized crime syndicates. He said the alleged leader of the Knights Templar, a former lieutenant of La Familia known as ""La Tuta"" -- the teacher -- ""has the same kind of religious inspiration"" as Moreno. While some of the cartels' leaders may believe in its ideology, Grayson says others have a more pragmatic approach, using religion as a ""recruiting device."" ""Now you're at one with the Lord, even as you decapitate people and carve (messages) into the bodies of your opponents,"" he said. Promoting peace, fighting a 'social cancer' Another group that uses the Knights Templar name has been waging its own campaign to distance itself from the Mexican drug gang and the Norway attacks. The international Christian nonprofit known as Knights Templar International issued a statement saying their group is not and has never been affiliated in any way with Breivik. ""Christ's message is one of love, understanding and tolerance of all peoples of the world,"" the organization said in a statement. ""How Anders Behring Breivik so misunderstood and corrupted Christ's message is beyond reason or belief."" The organization's Mexico chapter also issued a statement saying it has no connection to the drug gang, which it referred to as a ""social cancer."" The statement lambasted the criminal group for committing acts that are ""full of shame, dishonor and totally contrary to the principles of the order."" Robert C.G. Disney, the grand commander of Knights Templar International, said the organization's more than 6,000 members around the world regularly support charitable projects, such as helping fund reconstruction of a Muslim mosque and a Christian church in Pakistan following mudslides there. ""Obviously it's very distressing for me and for all of our members to see our name bandied about by the drug cartel and this deranged person in Norway,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, we do not have exclusive rights to the words 'Knights Templar.' Those words have been in the public domain for almost 1,000 years."" Members can join Knights Templar International only by invitation, Disney said, but the organization has no particular church affiliation, and provides humanitarian aid to anyone in need, regardless of race or creed. ""We have no political or religious agenda,"" he said. ""Our agenda is basically all about bringing about peace, reconciliation and understanding.""

"(CNN) -- ""I didn't become a nurse to risk dying -- by getting infected from a patient -- and then going home and infecting my children, too!"" the nurse told me. She was angry and afraid. A new infectious disease was rapidly spreading with no treatment and no end in sight, terrifying doctors, nurses and the public at large. As a medical student, I remember being afraid to touch patients with this deadly disease, anxious I might catch it. My instructors told me just to swipe my hands and stethoscope with a tiny alcohol wipe and not stick myself with a needle after drawing blood. But I was scared. Many doctors announced that they would not work in certain hospitals where they felt the disease was more likely. The year was 1984, and the disease was HIV/AIDS. Survey showed that half of medical interns and residents would not continue to treat patients with this disease, if given a choice. Over the past few weeks, I have thought back to that era, as fears of Ebola grip the nation. For about 15 years -- from its first identification in 1981 until demonstration of its effective treatment, using the so-called ""cocktail"" in 1997 -- fears of HIV swept the world. Ebola and HIV are both transmitted through bodily fluids, and potentially fatal. Ebola is far more contagious to caregivers -- mere exposure to bodily fluids such as saliva can spread it. Our responses to the epidemic of HIV have several lessons to teach us. With Ebola, we have not yet seen large numbers of health care professionals announcing that they do not want to come to work because of the possible risks to themselves. Certainly, some may not want to report to duty to the Dallas hospital where exposures have occurred, but the vast majority of health care professionals continue to be prepared to treat patients in emergency rooms and elsewhere across the country. Several doctors and nurses are now getting infected as well -- most recently Dr. Craig Spencer from my institution -- Columbia University Medical Center. It is a scary time to be a doctor or nurse. Medicine has always depended on providers putting themselves at some risk. We aim to minimize these dangers, but they often persist. Until recently, a clear social contract existed concerning medical professionals. Doctors and nurses agreed to put themselves at danger to help their patients because they operated not just from an economic model of a job description, but from a more profound moral sense of commitment to beneficence -- to the health and well-being of their patients. They accepted that sometimes they would have to put their patients' needs ahead of their own. Such commitment aids patients and society and instills trust. But that professionalism is diminishing as caring for patients evolves from a ""calling"" to merely a ""job."" In the end, countless health professionals and I overcame our fear and treated patients with HIV. One surgeon announced, ""any staff member who does not want to treat these patients should simply plan to no longer come to work"" -- i.e., to quit. None did. Yet in all the attention given to the current Ebola crisis, little has been said about the extraordinary heroism of Doctors Without Borders -- an organization better known by its French name, Medicins Sans Frontiers -- and other health care professionals putting themselves on the front lines. This organization in particular has emerged as for its inspiring heroism. In March, MSF started responding to this Ebola outbreak, and by June it declared the epidemic was ""out of control"" and that the organization had reached the limit of what it can do alone, calling on the world to provide more aid. But precious weeks passed. Only in August did the CDC issue its first news release about this outbreak. Still, MSF continued to work hard on the front lines in Africa, instituting and following procedures for protecting providers that far exceeded those of the vastly better-resourced United States and have only belatedly become the gold standard. Why? Because they worked hard to uphold their professional ideals. Their moral commitment has motivated them to respond to crises and develop expertise in delivering on-the-ground care in emergencies. MSF understands that adequate resources must be marshaled to deal with potential outbreaks. But in the United States, we have underfunded governmental health care agencies involved in disease prevention and disaster preparedness at all levels. Many legislators have argued for less government involvement in our lives and less public health infrastructure. But in a crisis, our nation demands that the Centers for Disease Control and state and local Public Health Departments protect us while struggling with increasingly limited budgets. The Ebola crisis has revealed serious gaps in our health care system, and we need to think broadly how to deal more effectively with future epidemics. We should also acknowledge the need to support professionals on the front lines of health care delivery. Their courage in facing this disease should inspire us, since in recent years, notions of medical professionalism have been under siege as profit motives and economic bottom lines drive our health care system. Insurance companies, health systems and others pressure physicians and nurses to see themselves as employees who punch time clocks and service clients rather than as professionals who care for patients. Consequently, health providers demonstrate more burnout, as they have had their ideals eroded. Those who are fully committed -- and there are still many -- have our appreciation. Historically, doctors and nurses have rallied to care for our sickest patients, sometimes placing themselves at significant risk. In the upcoming months, these professionals will be among our greatest weapons against this modern plague.","Robert Klitzman: As fear of Ebola grips the nation, I think back on how HIV/AIDS scared the world .

"Iowa City, Iowa (CNN) -- Katherine Valde is ready when a fellow student says ""no thanks"" to early voting because of the thrill of casting a ballot on Election Day. ""Things come up, you can have an exam,"" says Valde, the president of the University of Iowa Democrats. ""You can wait until Election Day and not know where your precinct is. A lot of students have to go to elementary schools around town, and they don't have cars, they don't really know where it is."" Truth is, Valde knows younger voters like herself are less reliable when it comes to turning out in the crunch, and ""with early voting, it just gives us 40 more chances to catch people."" Valde led by example Thursday, waiting in line for more than an hour to cast her ballot on the first day of in-person early voting in Iowa. The line at the Iowa City Public Library was dominated by Obama voters, as was a Des Moines polling place CNN visited as the doors opened Thursday. Valde says the Obama campaign and state Democratic Party have urged her to keep checking her list and pushing students to vote now. ""If you vote early, it frees up campaign resources to talk to people who might be undecided,"" she told us as she waited patiently to vote. Iowa is one of 35 states plus the District of Columbia that allow some form of early in-person voting. Of the nine presidential battlegrounds CNN now rates as tossups, only New Hampshire and Virginia do not have large-scale early voting. In voting, the early bird skips the line . In Iowa four years ago, early voting accounted for 36% of the ballots cast for president. In Johnson County, home of the University of Iowa, it was 55%, the highest of Iowa's 99 counties, and County Auditor Tom Slockett says demand for early ballots so far is up significantly from 2008. Key states voting early . And Democrats have a big early edge. In Johnson County, requests for mail-in ballots as of Monday were running more than 12-1 in favor of Democrats. Statewide, as of close of business Wednesday, the Iowa Secretary of State's office said Democrats had a nearly 5-1 edge in making requests for absentee ballots. Republicans here don't dispute the early Democratic advantage in ballot requests. But they promise to narrow the edge somewhat; the GOP's first mailing nudging Republicans to consider mail-in voting was sent just this week. Iowa Republicans also suggest too much can be made of the early numbers, making the case that those voting before the presidential debates are hardcore partisans who were almost certain to vote eventually anyway. ""If you look at who is early-voting right now, absentee ballots, 80%, almost 90%, are 'four of four' voters, meaning they voted in the last four elections,"" veteran Iowa GOP strategist Steve Grubbs told CNN. ""So it's a difference of strategy. You put your money into the last three weeks or you put your money into early voting. The Republican Party will put a little more into the last three weeks, and the Democrats a little more into the first initial blast of early voting."" Grubbs said one effort in which Democrats were smart to focus so much early voting attention was younger voters. ""Four years ago there was a lot of enthusiasm among younger voters and everybody knows that has lessened,"" Grubbs said. ""They have got to figure out the strategy to increase their early voting."" Polls: Obama leads in New Hampshire, tight race in Nevada, North Carolina . On the flip side, he said Republican Mitt Romney runs stronger among the state's elderly voters, who are among the most reliable to cast ballots. More broadly, Grubbs conceded a modest Obama edge in Iowa at the moment and said there is nervous talk among some Republicans that Romney could hurt GOP candidates in competitive congressional and other races. In his view, such talk is premature. ""Clearly if a (presidential) candidate loses by more than five, it starts to affect down-ballot and that's a big issue for Republicans,"" Grubbs said. ""The way I look at it, we are starting the fourth quarter. We have a strong quarterback. And anyone who knows football knows the fourth quarter is where most of the action happens. So October will be big; and if Romney has a good start to the month, we will be fine."" Iowa Republicans also say, despite the Democratic edge in early voting so far, that the GOP is breaking records in terms of its grassroots organizing. At a Linn County phone bank in Cedar Rapids, volunteer Karen Zmoos (pronounced Smoose) is credited with making the millionth voter call in Iowa this cycle. She is pleasantly working the phones again this week, and adding this question when a voter indicates support for the Romney-Ryan ticket: ""Excellent. Would you be interested in voting early this election?"" Zmoos says Iowa's unpredictable winters make her a fan of early and absentee voting, and she shrugs off the early Democratic edge in absentee ballot requests as temporary. ""You know we are working hard here,"" Zmoos said during a quick break from working the phones. ""We are rolling up our sleeves and putting our boots on, and we are going at it. We still have time."" What questions would you like to ask the candidates? Share with us on CNN iReport .","Iowa is first battleground state to open early voting and one of 35 states that allow it .

"(CNN) -- In a ruling that could reverberate nationwide, the Indiana Supreme Court upheld the state's voucher program, which gives poor and middle class families public funds to help pay for private school tuition, including religious schools. Indiana has the broadest school voucher program available to a range of incomes, critics say, and could set a precedent as other states seek ways to expand such programs. Supporters say it gives families without financial means more options on where to educate their children. However, opponents of the Indiana program had sued to block it, describing it as unconstitutional and saying it takes money from public schools. Teresa Meredith, the vice president of the Indiana State Teachers Association and one of the plaintiffs, said she was ""very disappointed in the ruling."" Unanimous ruling . As many as 9,000 students statewide are part of the voucher program and more than 80% use the funds to go to religious schools, according to Meredith. But in its unanimous 5-0 ruling, the Supreme Court said that was not an issue. It said it did not matter that funds had been directed to religious schools as long as the state was not directly funding the education. The tuition, the court said, was being funded by the parents who chose to pay it with their vouchers. ""Whether the Indiana program is wise educational or public policy is not a consideration,"" Chief Justice Brent Dickson wrote. The public funds ""do not directly benefit religious schools but rather directly benefit lower-income families with school children."" Expanding the program . Unlike other states, Indiana's program is considered especially extensive because the vouchers are not limited to low-income students in failing schools. A family of four with an annual household income of $64,000 is eligible for vouchers worth up to $4,500 per child, according to the program. Indiana Republican Gov. Mike Pence has pushed to expand the program. ""I welcome the unanimous decision by the Indiana Supreme Court to uphold our school choice program,"" Pence said. ""I've long believed that parents should be able to choose where their children go to school regardless of their income."" The state Senate education committee will hear a House bill Wednesday that calls for expanding the voucher program to include children with special needs and those in military families if their household income is as high as $85,000 for a family of four. Meredith calls the timing ""interesting,"" saying she feels the schools are getting hit twice. She believes the Supreme Court ruling will sway lawmakers who were undecided on the issue before Tuesday's ruling. She is concerned about the future of the public school system and says other districts nationwide that have voucher programs should watch where the dollars are going and sound the alarm quickly when they see the negative fiscal impact as a result of students transferring to private schools. A nationwide debate . Private school tuition vouchers are a hot political issue nationwide. They began in Milwaukee in 1990, according to the National Education Association, and were followed by two other voucher plans in Ohio and Florida. In 2002, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a challenge to the voucher program in Ohio using logic similar to Tuesday's ruling in Indiana. Courts in Wisconsin and Arizona have also upheld voucher-type laws, according to the American Federation for Children, a pro-voucher group. A voucher case is in appeal to the Colorado Supreme Court and another one is awaiting ruling at the Louisiana Supreme Court. Glenda Ritz is the Indiana Superintendent of Public Instruction. She is not a fan of the voucher system, but in her role in the school system, she was named as one of the defendants. ""As state superintendent, I will follow the court's ruling and faithfully administer Indiana's voucher program,"" she said. ""However, I personally believe that public dollars should go to public schools, and I encourage Hoosiers to send that message to their representatives in the statehouse.""","Indiana has the broadest school voucher program available to a range of incomes .

"LANSING, Michigan (CNN) -- Mike Green's family is good at making things. Through four generations of putting cars together, they've built a city, created a community, and forged a legacy. Portrait of an auto worker legacy -- three generations of the Green family gather at Lansing's UAW meeting hall. Green, 48, is president of United Auto Workers Local 652 in Lansing, Michigan, where General Motors has been building cars for more than 100 years, first under the Oldsmobile name and later expanding to include Cadillac, Buick and Pontiac models. Following his grandfather, both parents, two uncles, an aunt and his sister into the Lansing factory complex, Green knew from the start that he would be held to high standards on the assembly line. ""When you went in there you not only were a part of something, building something and putting it together, but as a family coming from there you didn't want to let anybody down,"" Green said. ""You knew you needed to do a good job. You knew that you were afforded the opportunity because of your father and maybe your grandfather before you. ... You don't want to disappoint your parents, you don't want to disappoint your family."" The Greens' GM dynasty is in jeopardy if General Motors doesn't survive the current crisis that has U.S. automakers asking Congress for financial help. That dynasty includes 10 family members -- all current or former autoworkers -- who gathered around a table at the Local 652 hall in west Lansing recently. Together they have close to 300 years of service with GM.  Watch the Green family say what future they see for GM » . Green's uncle Bob Evans, 73, started at Oldsmobile in 1961, having served 10 years in the Army's 11th Airborne Division in Germany, Lebanon and the early days of U.S. involvement in Vietnam. Evans, a skilled tradesman, met his future wife, Pat, working in a plastics department. ""From the beginning, it's been quite evident that what General Motors has done for my family and for the rest of us is put food on the table and [provide] a steady job,"" Evans said as sentiment clutched his voice. That steady job has been no small thing, Green's sister Cindy DeLau, 49, added. ""Along with the good standard of living, we've had health care, we went through braces,"" she said, casting a sidelong smirk at her brother, ""all the good things that having a decent-paying job brings to a family."" The family and others like it weren't just working for themselves, though. ""There was a lot of pride in what we did in General Motors through the years,"" said Mike Green's father, Marine Corps veteran Richard Green, 73. ""My father [Kenneth Green] hired in in '45; he was part of the great group that won the Second World War. When I hired in, the Korean War was in full bloom. We built jet engines here to help the war effort. ... ""We were one of the spokes that helped win the Second World War, the Korean War and the Cold War with what we manufactured at General Motors. We've done more through the generations than just build cars."" At the other end of the family spectrum is Mike Green's son Rollin Green, 23, who came to work for General Motors full time in June of this year. Because of concessions the UAW has made to help GM stay afloat and preserve jobs, he's paid at half the rate of the older generation. Still, he's confident about the future of GM and Local 652. ""I would like to think we could sit back and weather the storm and hopefully come out of this stronger than we went into it,"" he said, adding that it won't be easy. ""We've sacrificed a lot in terms of pay, and we're doing everything that we can on our side to help save the corporation,"" Rollin Green said. ""The corporation needs to continue trimming the fat, and they need to take precautions, and they need to take a little [pain] like we did."" The GM-UAW family ties reach beyond bloodlines. ""You develop all these relationships in the plant. You spend so much time with these people, they're like family,"" Mike Green said. ""You form bonds that are lifelong."" ""It's people you've grown up with,"" DeLau agreed. ""I've got 31 years in, and there are people I hired in with, and I'm still with them. I know their kids, their grandkids. It's a huge family."" Their cousin Ed Sawyer, 48, a GM carpenter, recalled having to leave work in a hurry when his daughter's birth came early. ""When I came back the next day, I had about six pink sacks sitting on the bench,"" he remembered with a wide smile. ""There were afghans and clothes. You know, we are a big family.""  See where else GM has plants » . Stereotypes of autoworkers as lazy or sloppy irk DeLau. ""I would invite [critics] in to an assembly plant to see the hard work that goes in. I have never once seen a car put itself together. ... It is very physical, hard work,"" she said. This family takes pride not only in being a part of GM in Lansing, but just as strongly in being a part of the UAW. ""That goes way back; it's up through the generations,"" Mike Green said. ""What it means to me is I'm a part of something where people stick together through the good, through the bad. ... ""We've talked about family sitting around this table, both your blood relatives and your extended family in the plant. And that's what the UAW brings to you: It teaches you how to stick together through thick and thin. And that's what you've seen through the generations.""","Four generations of one family have worked for General Motors .

"Miami (CNN) -- Hurricane Katia weakened to a Category 2 storm Tuesday as it churned in the Atlantic Ocean, forecasters said. As of 8 p.m. ET Tuesday, Katia was about 335 miles (540 kilometers) south-southwest of Bermuda, packing maximum sustained winds of 105 mph (165 kph), according to the Miami-based National Hurricane Center. The storm was moving northwest at about 10 mph (17 kph). The Bermuda Weather Service issued a tropical storm watch for the island, with tropical storm conditions possible within 48 hours. Up to 2 inches of rain could fall across Bermuda, the hurricane center said. The storm is expected to stay away from the United States. The front moving the remnants of Tropical Depression Lee up the East Coast is anticipated to help keep Katia offshore, according to CNN's weather bureau. ""On the forecast track, the core of Katia is expected to move over the western Atlantic between Bermuda and the East Coast of the United States,"" the hurricane center said. ""Eventually the hurricane is going to turn toward the north and northeast away from the U.S. coast. We are becoming more confident of that,"" said Todd Kimberlain, a forecaster at the National Hurricane Center. However, the storm is expected to produce large swells, heavy surf and rip currents. ""There might be 10- to 12-foot breakers,"" Kimberlain said. ""These swells will affect much of the Eastern Seaboard of the United States and then down into the Bahamas."" Besides the U.S. East Coast, the swells are expected to affect Bermuda and the Greater Antilles, along with eastern Bahamas beaches, the hurricane center said. ""These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions,"" it added. Hurricane-force winds of at least 74 mph extended up to 80 miles (130 kilometers) out from the storm's center.

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Park Police is failing to adequately keep track of its firearms, creating an environment in which weapons are vulnerable to theft or misuse, according to a government report released Friday. Due to ""a lackadaisical attitude toward firearms management"" by commanders, investigators said they found ""credible evidence of conditions that would allow for theft and misuse of firearms, and the ability to conceal the fact if weapons were missing."" In a force of approximately 640 officers, the report says, hundreds of weapons were not properly accounted for. The auditors also allege that the agency has more than 1,400 extra weapons, including 477 military-style automatic and semiautomatic rifles. The head of the Park Police officers' union, Ian Glick, said there are shortcomings in the ""antiquated system of weapon tracking,"" but public safety was never put in jeopardy. ""None of these weapons were ever seized in a crime, or found on someone who shouldn't have one,"" he said. While the tracking system has its failings, he said, ""all the weapons are accounted for. Every weapon, every stick of ammo, everything is accounted for. But it's not accounted for in the National Park Service weapons inventory computer system."" The National Park Service declined to respond to Glick's specific assertion. But it said it has immediately ordered a complete weapons inventory, to address the ""significant, systemic firearms management problems"" identified in the report. ""I have no tolerance for this management failure,"" said Jonathan Jarvis, director of the National Park Service. He pledged to implement the report's recommendations on record-keeping, and went on to praise the police officers. ""The brave men and women of the U.S. Park Police are professionals who put their life on the line every day,"" he said, ""protecting our parks for millions to enjoy."" The report cited several examples of mishandling of weapons, including two officers it says brought their rifles home with them. But at least one example has come into dispute. The audit asserts that a former chief of the Park Police never turned in his handgun, and 10 years after his retirement it was taken from him by an instructor at a qualification course for retired law enforcement officers, who happened to notice the former chief still had government property. But the former chief, Robert Langston, rejects the claim, saying he never kept a handgun, he never had one taken away, and he was never asked by auditors about the allegation. The first he heard of it was when he got a call from CNN on Friday morning. ""Nobody ever confiscated a gun of mine. I would recall that,"" he said. ""Where did they get that?"" He said he turned in his weapon when he left government service, and showed CNN his paperwork. When asked about the contradiction, the inspector general's office said its report was based on Park Police records, and the discrepancy just shows the extent of the agency's record-keeping problems. The National Park Service did not respond to an inquiry about the former chief's paperwork. 7 ways budget cuts will hit national parks .","National Park Service orders inventory .

"Washington (CNN) -- Three years after that awful day -- the day a teenager accidentally backed his car over their little girl -- Michael and Brandy Dahlen have forgiven their young neighbor. But they're having a tougher time coming to grips with the actions of the federal government. The source of Dahlen's frustration: the government's failure to implement a law requiring back-up cameras on new motor vehicles. Enacted in 2008, the law had a 2011 deadline. It is now two years overdue. Had the Department of Transportation acted quicker, Dahlen believes, there is a small chance his daughter would be still alive, and a near certainty many other children would have been saved from so-called ""backover"" accidents. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, more than 200 people are killed and 17,000 injured every year in backover crashes, when drivers back over objects in the blind spot behind them. Bigger cars and SUVs, the government says, mean bigger blind spots. Children under the age of 5 account for 44% of the fatalities. And in a high percentage of those cases, the driver is a parent or family member, compounding the emotional trauma. In a nation almost numb to tragedies on its highways, tragedies in its driveways still rattle families and communities. For the Dahlens, the unthinkable happened on April 11, 2010. Abigail, a cheerful girl with whispy blonde hair and deep dimples, was playing in the front yard when she chased a ball into the neighbor's driveway. It happened quickly. ""She was 2, had just turned 2, so she was acting like a 2-year-old and pitched a fit because she fell down and got hurt,"" Michael Dahlen said. A teenager, unaware that Abigail was still behind his car, backed up, striking her. At the hospital, Brandy Dahlen learned that her daughter was dead. ""I felt like someone opened a tap on my toes, and all of my life just drained out of me into my feet and a puddle on the floor,"" Brandy says. ""Just this complete numbness and darkness, and it was the most awful thing I could imagine."" After the accident, the Dahlens learned that a law had been passed in 2008 -- before Abigail was even born -- to require the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to develop rules to prevent back-up accidents. NHTSA determined that the only technology available to comply with the mandate would be rear-mounted video cameras, with in-vehicle displays. In December of 2010, NHTSA published a proposed rule and set out to meet a February 2011 deadline for enacting it. On-board cameras, NHTSA said at the time, could cut in half deaths and injuries due to backing crashes, at a cost of about $159 to $203 per vehicle, or about $1.9 billion to $2.7 billion a year for the nation's 16.6 million fleet of new vehicles. (The price has since fallen, advocates say.) But the Department of Transportation twice extended the deadline, first to December of 2011, and again to February of 2012, a deadline it has missed. The DOT said the extensions were necessary because of the ""large volume of public comments and the complexity of some of the issues."" Asked this week about the status of the rule, the DOT declined to give specifics, saying only that the ""Department remains committed to improving rearview visibility for the nation's automobiles. The rule remains under review."" Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D- Illinois, one of the sponsors of the bill, said she was ""mystified"" by the DOT's delays. ""They might be doing a cost-benefit analysis worrying about the cost, but I think that is not a sound excuse,"" she said. ""How much is it really going to cost to have a camera, some kind of a camera in a car... We have bells and whistles of all sorts in our automobiles, certainly this safety should be in all automobiles."" Consumer advocates blame the auto industry for the delays. ""After all, you must remember, they (carmakers) were against seat belts, they were against airbags, they were against rollover protection technology and other safety measures,"" said Joan Claybrook, former NHTSA administrator and chair emeritus of the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen. ""It's time for the auto manufacturers ... and the White House (which) is bowing to their wishes, to say, 'We're going to do the right thing. We're going to protect the children of this nation,"" she said. In a statement, the auto manufacturers lobby said only that manufacturers increasingly are adding cameras, even in the absence of the rule. ""Rearview camera systems are available on 7 in 10 new vehicles, as either standard equipment or an option,"" said Wade Newton of the Auto Alliance. ""This provides consumers with many choices when it comes to what type of safety technology is appropriate for their families."" The Dahlens, who now drive a car equipped with a rearview camera, say a rule is still needed. And they warn others of dangers right outside their homes. ""I always told my children not to play in the road. Everyone is aware that is dangerous; don't play in the road,"" said Brandy Dahlen. ""But it just never occurred to me how dangerous driveways were. And kids play in driveways all the time."" ""Five years is a long time for any law,"" Michael Dahlen said of the government's unfinished business, ""and for me it's really unacceptable."" Said Brandy Dahlen, ""It is just so painful for us to think that everyone was aware of this problem, everyone was aware that something needed to be done before she (Abigail) was even born. And even still, this much later, (the rule) isn't out. That just isn't acceptable. It needs to be out."" ""We still have a small hole in the center of our family where we are missing a person,"" says Michael Dahlen. ""And I really don't want anybody else to have to go through that.""","More than 200 people are killed, 17,000 injured every year when drivers back over objects .

"Rome, Italy (CNN) -- Andrea Quintero was described by those who knew her as a gentle soul and a devout Catholic. Transgendered and homeless, she left Colombia for Italy in search of a society that could accept her for who she was -- a man who felt like a woman. But in Rome it was no different. In fact it was worse. She said her paralyzed arm and prominent limp were evidence of the regular beatings she endured as a drifter at Rome's main railway station. Despite the abuse, she hoped for better. ""I dream of meeting a boy that has money and that will allow me to leave such a terrible life,"" Andrea said in an interview with an Italian newspaper. That dream would never come true. On July 29 this year, Andrea's body was found after she had been beaten to death on platform 10 of Rome's main railway station. That very same day, on a plane ride from Brazil to the Vatican, Pope Francis uttered the five words about homosexuality that have come to define his papacy. ""Who am I to judge?"" The answer signaled a shift in the relationship between the Catholic Church and the gay community. He said that while homosexuality is still a sin, gay people should not be marginalized. CNN Vatican analyst John Allen said: ""In general what you are going to see is a church that is more compassionate and tolerant, particularly with regard to gays and transgendered persons, but the concern that people might mistake that compassion for a change in church doctrine, that is no longer going to get in the way of outreach."" Months after Andrea's death, her body remained unclaimed in the morgue. Local charity workers decided Andrea needed to be acknowledged with a Catholic funeral. A priest at Chiesa Del Gesu, one of the most prominent Jesuit churches in Rome opened its doors. ""With Pope Francis, we have courage, we have enthusiasm,"" said Father Giovanni La Manna, who helped organize the funeral. ""We have no excuse. We are called to open our hearts."" Charity workers, government officials, even the city's mayor gathered to pay tribute. Andrea's coffin lay amid the church's breathtaking frescos. A Catholic mass was held in her memory. And then something happened that stunned those inside the church. Throughout the mass, the priest acknowledged Andrea as a 'She'. ""Up until this point we haven't been acknowledged by the Catholic Church,"" said Vladimir Luxuria, a transgendered activist who attended the funeral. ""It is as if the Catholic Church says 'we see you the way you feel you are.'"" While Andrea's dream of a white church wedding was never possible -- at least in death she was accepted by the religion she believed in so deeply.","Homeless transgendered woman murdered at Rome's main rail station in July .

"(CNN) -- Despite decades of propaganda from marijuana prohibitionists, a majority of the American public has indeed said ""enough"" to the policies of cannabis criminalization. And no amount of fear-mongering is going to change this fact. Writing in a just-published report by the Brookings Institute, ""The New Politics of Legalization,"" authors E.J. Dionne and William Galston conclude, ""In less than a decade, public opinion has shifted dramatically toward support for the legalization of marijuana. ... Demographic change and widespread public experience using marijuana imply that opposition to legalization will never again return to the levels seen in the 1980s. The strong consensus that formed the foundation for many of today's stringent marijuana laws has crumbled."" Indeed it has. Never in modern history has there existed greater public support for ending the nation's nearly century-long experiment with pot prohibition and replacing it with a system of legalization and regulation. The proof is in the polls. For example, according to a May 2013 Reason Magazine-Rupe nationwide survey, conducted by Princeton Survey Research Associates International, more than nine out of 10 U.S. adults say that people who possess or consume small quantities of cannabis should not face jail time. Also last month, a May 2013 nationwide Fox News telephone poll, conducted by under the direction of Anderson Robbins Research and Shaw & Co. Research, reported that 85% of voters support allowing adults to use cannabis for therapeutic purposes. The total is an increase in support of 4 percentage points since Fox last polled the question in 2010 and is the highest level of public support for the issue ever reported in a scientific poll. Opinion: Legalizing marijuana a boon to potheads . Then there is this: An April 2013 national survey commissioned by the Pew Research Center reports that 72% of Americans now believe that ""government efforts to enforce marijuana laws cost more than they are worth,"" and 60% say the government should no longer enforce federal anti-marijuana laws in states that have approved its use. And this: According to a December 2012 Angus Reid national sampling of U.S .voters, 66% say that they expect cannabis to be legal within the next 10 years. And finally there's this: recently published polls by Gallup, Pew, Quinnipiac University and Public Policy Polling all find that far more Americans now favor legalizing marijuana for adults than believe in its continued prohibition. Why? The answer has become obvious. The ongoing enforcement of cannabis prohibition burdens taxpayers, encroaches upon civil liberties, engenders disrespect for the law, impedes legitimate scientific research into the plant's medicinal properties, and disproportionately impacts communities of color. Furthermore, the criminalization of cannabis simply doesn't work. Despite more than 70 years of federal prohibition, Americans' consumption of and demand for cannabis is here to stay. Voters' recent passage of legalization measures in Colorado and Washington acknowledges this reality. Such laws seek to take control of the marijuana market from untaxed criminal enterprises and, to impose common-sense regulations governing cannabis' personal use by adults and licensing its production. Unlike the federal government, which continues to define cannabis as an illegal commodity that is as dangerous as heroin, voters recognize that a pragmatic regulatory framework that allows for limited, licensed production and sale of cannabis to adults but restricts use among young people best reduces the risks associated with its use or abuse. Gupta: Why I changed my mind on weed . Marijuana regulations can allow governments to establish legal parameters for where, when, and how markets operate. They can provide oversight of who may legally operate in those markets and provides guidelines for best practices. Society would clearly benefit from this. Only criminals and cartels benefit from the unregulated environment. Maybe an even more persuasive if not entirely counter-intuitive argument in favor of legalization as a means to actually deter youth use is found in recently released Gallup polling indicating a dramatic reduction in youth cannabis use rate as there is a surge in favor of cannabis legalization from virtually all segments of American society. It is time to end our failed policies on marijuana criminalization and replace them with ones that regulate the cannabis market and allow for its private consumption by adults. Marijuana legalization is no longer a matter of if; it's a matter of when. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Allen St. Pierre and Paul Armentano.","Allen St. Pierre, Paul Armentano: Ground has shifted in favor of legalizing pot .

"(CNN) -- Picture this scene: an iPad resting on a table with the familiar 2D image from a video call on the screen. The flat display shows your caller's upper body, talking away. But below this their hands and arms reach up out of the tabletop into the physical world, gently lifting a small red ball off the table and passing it from one digitally-recreated hand to the other. It can already happen. It's the work of the inFORM Dynamic Shape Display: a tabletop covered in miniature white squares that rise up like towers, to turn digital content into physical objects. Used in conjunction with a 3D sensor, like Microsoft's Kinect, it can capture a person's physical appearance and reproduce it in tiny skyscraper-like ""pixel"" blocks -- on-the-fly, anywhere in the world. ""Essentially it's very similar to those kind of pin toys that you might know from museum novelty stores,"" explains MIT's Daniel Leithinger, part of the Tangible Media Group behind the inFORM. Similar -- yes -- just a lot more impressive. To add color to the block shapes, a projector on the ceiling beams down light, turning the towers psychedelic hues as Leithinger demonstrates the table's capabilities. It also has a deeper purpose -- communicating an extra layer of information from the sender to the receiver on the other end: ""When you move your hands, not only do you have the shape of the hands, but you also see the color, the texture of the hands,"" says Leithinger. Leithinger shows off a couple of the table's party tricks: sculpting a model car from the blocks, coloring it in, and video-chatting about it with a colleague -- allowing them both to get hands-on with the model, regardless of physical distance. The display doubles as an active controller, allowing a user to interact with 3D menus constructed by the table by moving the little red ball. ""It's not real 3D because we can only push up and down each one of these pins,"" says Leithinger. ""We can't push them sideways or have any other control over them at the moment -- we usually call this affect '2.5D'"" Even so, the inFORM's remarkable capabilities seem to given some users big ideas. ""A lot of comments we get are like -- 'Oh, it's like a super power',"" he laughs. They say it feels like being X-Men nemesis Magneto, he explains -- suddenly having the power to manipulate the world at a distance, just with a wave of your hand. For Leithinger, his ambitions are a little more down to earth. ""In the future, where we hope to get is something like, say, a phone that you could have in your pocket, and as you interact with things on the phone you can actually touch them."" It remains to be seen whether or not users will be excited about a smartphone that can poke them back. Leithinger, for one, has a good feeling about it.","The inFORM Dynamic Shape Display is a table that can render 3D content physically .

"(CNN) -- ABC is beginning its reconstruction of ""The View"" by bringing back Rosie O'Donnell, one of the most famous co-hosts from the talk show's history. O'Donnell will rejoin the talk show in the fall, according to a Twitter message from the show's main account. The announcement confirmed a TMZ report this week. ABC previously announced that of all the current co-hosts, Whoopi Goldberg would be the only one back for the coming season. Barbara Walters signed off in May, and two others, Jenny McCarthy and Sherri Shepherd, are going to depart this summer. O'Donnell didn't immediately comment on the announcement. On Twitter, she posted a photo of her family vacationing in Florida. O'Donnell co-hosted ""The View"" during its 10th season in 2006-07. Her on-air battles with co-host Elisabeth Hasselbeck -- over issues like the Iraq war, which O'Donnell was vehemently against -- were loud and legendary. ""Their back-and-forth has helped buoy ratings,"" The Los Angeles Times reported at the time, but the tumult was sometimes tough to watch and changed the usually cheery climate of the talk show. O'Donnell left after just nine months. And she hadn't been back until this year, when she visited in February for a ""Hot Topics"" segment. ""This feels kind of weird but good weird,"" she quipped. She also made a joke about being ""exiled again"" if Hasselbeck were still there. Hasselbeck is now a co-host of ""Fox & Friends"" on the Fox News Channel. With O'Donnell's return in the news this week, Hasselbeck interrupted her vacation to call in to ""Fox & Friends"" and comment about the rumors on Wednesday. She said O'Donnell was ""at ease"" and ""walked around with such control"" when O'Donnell, Hasselbeck and the rest of the former co-hosts reunited for a farewell to Walters in May. ""I do believe this has been in the works for a very, very long time,"" Hasselbeck said. ABC has at least two more seats to fill around ""The View"" table, and there has been some speculation that the show might add a male co-host for the first time. A spokeswoman for the show said this week that ""The View"" ""will be moving in an exciting new direction next season and ABC has made decisions to evolve the show creatively.""

"Mumbai, India (CNN) -- ""My mother says I will make a name for myself."" Shweta Katti sings lyrics from a popular Bollywood song that has special meaning to her. Growing up in Mumbai's largest red-light district, in a makeshift room above a brothel, Katti often found it difficult to study and stay focused on her future. ""I was young. I didn't know how to deal with the situation,"" said Katti, now 18. ""There were men who used to ask me, 'Do you want to sleep with me?' "" Katti says she was sexually abused around age 11 or 12. It was hard to imagine a way out. But with inspiration from her mother and help from a local charity, Katti is now much more optimistic. She won a scholarship to Bard College in New York, and she is set to enroll this fall. ""I don't know what I'm going to find out there, but I'm really excited,"" Katti told CNN's Kristie Lu Stout. ""This is going to be an adventure for me: a new place, new people, new culture."" Katti's unlikely journey has received global attention. Newsweek recently named her one of 25 women to watch under age 25. It would not have been possible without the help of Kranti, a charity that is empowering girls from Mumbai's red-light districts. ""Everyone looks at these girls like, 'Poor them, they're victims, they're just going to suffer and have such terrible lives,' "" said Kranti founder Robin Chaurasiya. ""But the fact is that people who go through all of these situations and experience these hardships I personally believe are going to make the most amazing leaders."" Katti credits her mother, Vandana, for encouraging her move to Kranti, which means ""revolution"" in Hindi. ""My mom is my inspiration, and she's the one who encouraged me and who said, 'You're going to do better, you are amazing,' "" Katti said. ""And of course the sex workers whom I was surrounded by, because my mom used to go to factory at like 9 in the morning and she used to come back at 7. I used to spend most of my time with them. ... Because of my mom and because of them, I'm here."" Katti's mother said she was forced to raise her children above a brothel because it was all she could afford. But she always dreamed of something better. ""From the time my daughter was born, I wanted her to read and write,"" she said. ""I didn't want her to endure what I did."" Katti said she now wants to study psychology so she can help other women back home. She hopes her story will inspire others in the red-light district to dream big. ""Every girl has it in herself. ... If given a chance, everybody can do this,"" she said. ""This is not like a supernatural thing in me, but I got the opportunity, I got this chance."" More: Forced to marry as child for safety .

"(CNN) -- If you're reading this somewhere in Africa, then perhaps you should thank Nii Quaynor. The Ghanaian professor is known as ""Africa's father of the internet,"" a web pioneer who helped establish some of the continent's first online connections. For some 20 years now, soft-spoken Quaynor has been at the forefront of web development across Africa. He is the first African to be elected to the board of ICANN, the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers. He's also played an important part in launching the African Network Operators Group and AfriNIC, the African internet numbers registry. As a result, Quaynor was recently inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame, lauded as an instrumental figure ""in the early design and development of the internet."" He is today chairman of Ghana's information technology agency and a professor at the country's Cape Coast University. CNN's African Voices spoke to Quaynor about the role of the internet in Africa's development and his dreams for the continent's digital future. An edited version of the interview follows. CNN: How did you get the title of father of the internet in Africa? Nii Quaynor: Actually I don't know, but perhaps I made a lot of effort to get my colleagues to understand and to participate and to begin to contribute to the internet. And I have been fortunate with a very good educational background and so I also wanted to impart the knowledge and I was a major contributor in building some of the important technical institutions that make up the internet ecosystem in Africa. In the process of doing that a lot of people perhaps felt that my leadership was good for them, and you might say, gave me that kind of description. CNN: What is the state of the internet in the continent? NQ: The health of the internet in Africa is good; we have good connectivity, at least to major capital cities; we also have good wireless through the mobile companies and other forms of connectivity, so connectivity is becoming less of a barrier, except that we are still working on the affordability side of that connectivity. Read this: 10 African tech startups you need to know . The part that we are yet to, in some sense, make headway is both in the use as well as in we being part of the production side of services for the internet. We don't have many businesses developing content or hosting content or doing e-commerce -- we have some banks trying to do internet banking, meaning we having companies beginning to adopt it, but we really haven't taken hold of it. Some of it may be because of inadequate policies, because our policies historically have been about the transmission side of things and so we need to take another look at how a country thinks about developing its internet. So we have a big challenge -- actually, we see it as an opportunity. Connectivity is not the problem, now it's shifting to the industry and we need to really build strong industries that will serve the needs of the one billion people in Africa. Read this: Tech hub working on 'Nigeria's next big idea' CNN: Do African governments understand the need for connectivity? NQ: I think governments now do understand; for most governments it's important. They may not know what they want to do with it, but they understand it's very important. That sometimes explains why government actions are seen as not coordinated or erratic, because they think it's very important but they yet don't have a full, sufficient understanding to know exactly how they want to interact with it or manage it or grow it. But certainly they recognize it is very important and many in governments are engaging with the internet technical community and other multi-stakeholder organizations to support them to evolve. Read this: Dropifi takes on Silicon Valley' We do understand that usually policy lags behind technology, so some of these sorts of conflicts would occur, but I think we have weathered the storm -- Africa is going beyond those days and now recognizes the importance of it. They are battling with controlling it, and soon we'll convince everyone that there is no need and that the right thing to do is to discipline it and begin to adopt it and make it do the right things for us and help define what Africa wants from the internet, which is not very obvious yet. CNN: What is your hope for Africa in the future? NQ: My hope for Africa in the future is that Africa will own its portion of the internet. Africa should strive to participate on its own terms on the internet, not leave it to chance to be determined. Africa can indeed determine how it wants to play in the internet and Africa should ensure that it is able to create the right policy environment for the internet to grow.","Ghanaian professor Nii Quaynor is an African internet pioneer .

"(CNN) -- A publicist for Jennifer Lawrence slammed the appearance of nude photographs of the Oscar-winning actress online Sunday as a ""flagrant violation of privacy."" ""The authorities have been contacted and will prosecute anyone who posts the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence,"" the publicist said in a written statement. Posts on 4chan, Reddit, Twitter and Tumblr claim to include nude photographs of Lawrence, who won an Academy Award last year for her role in ""Silver Linings Playbook."" Twitter posts on verified accounts of several other celebrities Sunday also reported hacks. ""To those of you looking at photos I took with my husband years ago in the privacy of our home, hope you feel great about yourselves,"" actress Mary E. Winstead wrote. ""Knowing those photos were deleted long ago, I can only imagine the creepy effort that went into this. Feeling for everyone who got hacked."" Some celebrities claimed the photos were doctored. An individual close to singer Ariana Grande told CNN photos claiming to show her are ""completely fake."" And actress Victoria Justice said pictures purporting to be her are fake. This isn't the first time celebrities have accused hackers of stealing risque photos. A judge sentenced Christopher Chaney of Florida to 10 years in federal prison in 2012 for stealing nude photos, scripts and personal information from the e-mail accounts of 50 entertainment industry figures, including movie stars Scarlett Johansson and Mila Kunis and singer Christina Aguilera. The first real case of a celebrity hacking attack was in 2005 when hackers logged into Paris Hilton's phone and stole photos of the reality star, Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer at computer security company F-Secure told CNN in 2011. Those hackers reportedly were able to break into Hilton's phone by correctly guessing the not-so-secret answer to her security question, which was ""tinkerbell,"" the name of her pet Chihuahua. CNN's Rachel Wells, Dave Alsup, Alan Duke and John D. Sutter contributed to this report.","NEW: An individual close to Ariana Grande says photos claiming to show her are ""completely fake""

"(CNN) -- It started out as a simple concept. Let people virtually grow gardens, raise farm animals and become farmers. It soon became a social media and gaming phenomenon. ""FarmVille"" celebrates its fifth anniversary this summer. Millions of players continue not only to harvest on a virtual landscape but also establish real-life relationships and support causes even as the game has plummeted from its unlikely peak at the top of the gaming world. Once virtually impossible to avoid on the pages of Facebook, ""FarmVille"" goes against gaming's standards. Devoid of intense competition, it's a farming simulation game in which players plant crops, raise livestock and generally go about the business of living off the land. In its first six weeks in 2009, ""FarmVille"" grew to more than 10 million players and became the most popular game on Facebook. By the next year, its player base passed the 80 million mark, according to information collected by AppData. By 2012, the game remained the site's seventh most popular game. Charles London, senior creative director for ""FarmVille2,"" said his team realizes that today's players are looking for a moment of peace and serenity in their gaming. He said he's thrilled how people are connecting through ""FarmVille."" ""Their lives are increasingly fragmented. They're overly 'technologied.' And they're separated from their community,"" London said. ""In 'FarmVille,' they can get away from that. They can have a fantasy of a sweet, quiet, serene farm, and they can play with other players who really care about each other."" Despite criticism about the mindless nature of the game (Time magazine rated it one of the 50 worst inventions in 2010), 370 million virtual crops are harvested every day in ""FarmVille"" and ""FarmVille 2,"" indicating players' dedication and involvement. As people moved to playing games on mobile phones, ""FarmVille"" fell to 84th place in game rankings this year before rebounding lately to 73rd, according to AppData. But the millions who have stuck with it and its sequels, ""FarmVille 2"" and ""FarmVille 2: Country Escape,"" say these games have not only been fun to play but also give them a chance to connect in meaningful ways with others. Sonya Reynolds, 34, of Morris Township, New Jersey, said the game helped her reconnect with a childhood friend who soon became her husband. ""We could help out on each other's farms and also be able to catch up with the past many years,"" Reynolds said. ""Since playing the game, I have built a chicken coop with Phil, my husband, and bought hens that I've 'owned' in 'Farmville 2.' "" According to a survey from ""Farmville"" maker Zynga, 80% of players say they've connected with people they otherwise wouldn't have through the game, and 34% play it with a significant other. Other ""farmers"" have stories about how the game has become an educational tool for children. Melissa Cunningham of Kingsland, Texas, said she started playing because it reminded her of her grandmother's farm. But she discovered the game could help her son with mathematics. ""Since playing 'FarmVille 2,' my son's math skills have drastically increased -- his grades improving from Cs to A-/B+,"" she said. ""I love that he's learning through a game he enjoys without thinking of it as 'homework.' "" London said his development team continually hears from players about what features they like or what they want to see in the future. He said the team wants to create features meaningful to players, including the ability to form virtual families. Players can now create their own virtual sweetheart, have a date, fall in love and get married in ""My Family Farm"" for ""FarmVille 2."" In the span of two weeks, Zynga said 752,000 players went on a ""first date"" and 280,000 made a marriage proposal to their in-game significant other. ""What I love most about 'My Family Farm' is it's so close to my life story as (my husband) Dean and I were childhood best friends,"" said Lynda Jordan of Atascadero, California. ""It's like watching us all over again! It sounds funny for a game to change my life, but it really has."" London said, ""We're not in the business of explicitly getting people to fall in love. We are in the business of getting people to meet each other through play."" The game and its players are also socially aware of causes and needs in real-life communities. In December, players raised $1 million for Feeding America through a special game expansion called Holiday Lights, according to Zynga. Players across the ""FarmVille"" franchise have raised almost $8 million for charity in five years, it said. London said he's impressed by the social interactions taking place through the ""FarmVille"" games. ""Human beings are innately social creatures,"" London said. ""For us to continue to broaden the appeal of games is to make sure that people can continue to do those things that are meaningful to them -- socialize and meet or compete or collaborate.""","""FarmVille"" players still growing gardens, raising livestock on a virtual scale .

"(CNN) -- Democrats know their push to try to force a vote in the Republican-led House isn't going anywhere. But that's not the point. It's an election year and Democrats believe blaming Republicans for failing to address the issue will put them on the defensive in November. House Democrats filed what is known as a ""discharge petition"" on Wednesday. If they get a majority of members to sign it, Republican leaders must put the Democratic bill increasing the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 an hour on the floor. Even if all 199 House Democrats signed the petition, it would take roughly 18 Republicans to defy their leaders and press for a vote. Aides from both parties -- and even some Republicans who say they could support some increase to the minimum wage - acknowledge that isn't going to happen. But with most the heavy legislative lifting essentially done for the year, Democrats want the debate over whether to raise the minimum wage to be a key part of their strategy to defeat GOP members. At a retreat earlier this month to map out plans for the year, the House Democratic campaign chief, Rep. Steve Israel of New York, said the November election will come down to voters deciding on the question, ""Whose side are you on?"" Democrats believe fighting for a higher minimum wage demonstrates they care about working Americans. Republicans argue a wage hike would lead to fewer jobs and actually hurt America. GOP lawmakers and aides say so far the issue hasn't been a top concern of voters, and they insist the November elections will hinge on the sluggish economy and problems their constituents are having dealing with the implementation of the new health care law known as Obamacare. But the minimum wage issue could prove tricky for Republicans in the fall. Even though Congress isn't likely to pass anything this year, a recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll showed that nearly two thirds of those Americans surveyed support boosting the minimum wage. The same poll found 77% of Democrats backed increasing the federal minimum wage level to $10.10 per hour and nearly half of Republicans surveyed also supported raising it to that level. Israel says Republicans are on the wrong side of public opinion. ""Middle class security is the fundamental issue of this election and House Republicans are going to have to go home to their districts and explain to voters why they protected billions in subsidies for big oil companies but they won't give America's middle class a raise,"" Israel said in a statement to CNN. Both sides are pointing to a report released earlier this month by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office. Republicans emphasize that it found that mandating a federal minimum wage of $10.10 in the next two years would cost the economy 500,000 jobs. Democrats are highlighting the part of the report that said increasing the pay rate would help lift 900,000 Americans out of poverty. Any momentum House Democrats hoped to generate could be blunted by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's decision this week to delay a vote on the issue until later this spring. But an event inside the Capitol on Wednesday with business leaders and advocates pushing for a higher wage rate was aimed at voters around the country, not at lawmakers. It's a continuation of the political message President Barack Obama has been pushing -- that Democrats are committed to eliminating income inequality. Obama recently signed an executive order upping the minimum rate for federal contractors to $10.10 an hour. ""Not to have this vote is to abdicate our responsibility that we have to the middle class, the backbone of our democracy. Mr. Speaker, give us a vote!"" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said at the rally. At their weekly Democratic caucus meeting, two top White House aides huddled with House Democrats to provide statistics and fact sheets they could use at home to demonstrate the economic impact of raising the minimum wage. Over the coming months, members are planning events in their districts to highlight their efforts to push GOP leaders for a vote. Democratic candidates will point to the discharge petition in Washington and accuse House Republicans of blocking a vote on a higher minimum wage. One moderate Republican, Pennsylvania Rep .Charlie Dent, who has been targeted by Democrats in the last several election cycles, told CNN he was open to raising the minimum wage. He pointed out that he voted in favor the last time Congress upped it in 2007. But he said if Congress acts again, any increase should be paired with other measures that boost job creation. Another GOP member, Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger, says he's willing to debate whether it makes sense to raise the minimum wage. But ""I also really recognize that all the Democrats are trying to do is go like look the shiny red ball - look over here while we have a terrible economy,"" he said. Kinzinger said he won't sign the discharge petition and dismissed it as a political move, telling CNN that ""it's an attempt to create a pressure point."" Republicans argue the Democratic focus on the minimum wage proves their point -- that the President's domestic program has kept the economy in a stalled state. ""The Democrats policies are keeping people in minimum wage jobs, or worse, costing our economy jobs as Obamacare is doing,"" House GOP campaign chief Greg Walden said in a written statement to CNN. He said Republicans will respond to Democratic attacks by talking about their proposals to shift people into better paying jobs that lead to greater opportunities and long term stability. Pressed on whether using the discharge petition was simply to make a political point, House Democratic Caucus Chairman Xavier Becerra told CNN said it comes down to a question a fairness. ""If you work in America you should be paid decently and if you work for the minimum wage you deserve a pay raise. We're interested in having a jobs agenda it would be great if Republicans would join us in that,"" he said.","Democrats opt for procedural maneuver to try to get House vote on the issue .

"(CNN) -- U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has said in a letter to the U.N. Security Council that the international mission to destroy Syria's chemical weapons is unprecedented and that the team faces many grave dangers. The joint mission, made up of personnel from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and the United Nations, is tasked with overseeing the elimination of all Syria's chemical weapons by the middle of next year. Syrians began destroying their country's chemical weapons program Sunday under the oversight of an advance team of inspectors from OPCW, the world's chemical weapons watchdog, and U.N. security personnel, Ban said. Syrian personnel used ""cutting torches and angle grinders to destroy or disable a range of items,"" the OPCW said. ""This included missile warheads, aerial bombs and mixing and filling equipment."" A second team of experts will be sent to Syria to ""augment the advance team"" of experts in the country, the OPCW said Tuesday. It did not give a date for their deployment. In his letter, sent late Monday, Ban set out the three phases of the mission: establishing an initial presence and verifying the Syrian government's declaration of its stockpiles; overseeing the destruction of chemical weapons; and verification of the destruction of any and all chemical weapons-related programs or materials. Opinion: Syria's other crisis . The teams going into Syria, which include security and medical personnel as well as the weapons inspectors, will have a support base in Cyprus where they can train for and plan their operations, the letter said. At the moment, an advance team of about 35 personnel is on the ground in Syria, but their numbers will eventually expand to about 100, Ban said. They face a ""dangerous and volatile"" environment, particularly in urban areas such as Damascus, Homs and Aleppo, the secretary-general warned. ""Heavy artillery, air strikes, mortar barrages and the indiscriminate shelling of civilians areas are commonplace and battle lines shift quickly,"" he said. Given that environment, the mission ""will establish a 'light footprint' in Syria, only deploying to Syria those personnel whose presence is necessary in the country to perform their tasks,"" Ban said. A civilian ""special coordinator"" will head the mission and report back to Ban and the director-general of the OPCW, Ahmet Uzumcu. Uzumcu told a session of the OPCW's executive council Tuesday that the developments so far ""present a constructive beginning for what will nonetheless be a long and difficult process."" Tight deadlines . The U.N. Security Council resolution that authorized the mission set a deadline of mid-2014 for Syria to destroy its chemical weapons or face consequences. Under the resolution, the international weapons inspectors must by November 1 complete their initial inspections of all Syrian chemical weapons and storage facilities and complete the eradication of production and chemical mixing facilities. Read more: Refugees inside their own war-torn country . The time frame for that work is ""very short,"" Ban said, especially given the complexity of the operation and the ongoing conflict. But, he said, the final phase of the mission ""will be the most difficult and challenging."" Over the period of eight months, the team is expected to ""support, monitor and verify the destruction of a complex chemical weapons programme involving multiple sites spread over a country engulfed in violent conflict."" This includes about 1,000 metric tons of ""chemical weapons, agents and precursors that are dangerous to handle, dangerous to transport and dangerous to destroy,"" he said. The inspectors will sometimes have to cross front lines and move through areas controlled by armed groups hostile to the joint mission's objectives, Ban added. The time frame for the phase would be ambitious in the most peaceful of circumstances, he said, but the current conditions make it ""an operation the likes of which, quite simply, have never been tried before."" Syrian commitment is key, says Ban . Syria, which has said it will cooperate with the international mission, has made a declaration of its chemical weapons sites. Ban said the success of the joint mission would ""first and foremost"" depend on a ""sustained, genuine commitment"" from the Syrian government to fulfill its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention and cooperate with the inspectors. He also called for any states with influence over the various sides in the conflict to support the international mission and ensure the safety of its personnel. The only way to bring an end to the ""appalling suffering"" of the Syrian people and end the crisis is through a political, not military, process, Ban added. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed Syria in a 15-minute conversation Tuesday on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation in Indonesia. The pair spoke about the U.N. resolution on destroying Syria's chemical weapons, according to a senior State Department official, as well as the need to move forward on scheduling peace talks in Geneva, Switzerland, involving all parties in the conflict. Syrian foreign minister at U.N. General Assembly: 'There is no civil war' There has been some skepticism over whether Syria will give up its entire chemical weapons arsenal. A defected Syrian brigadier general, Zaher al-Sakat, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour last week that in addition to four secret locations within Syria, the regime is currently transferring chemical weapons to Iraq and Lebanon, an allegation that the commander of the opposition Free Syrian Army, Gen. Salim Idriss, also recently made to Amanpour. Iraq and Lebanon have denied the claims. The U.N. resolution, which capped a month of dramatic diplomacy, was based on a deal struck between the United States and Russia that averted an American military strike over allegations the Syrian government used sarin nerve gas in an August 21 attack on a Damascus suburb. U.S. officials said at least 1,400 people died in the attack. Syria denied responsibility, blaming rebel forces. CNN's Joe Sterling and Larry Register contributed to this report.","NEW: A second team of experts is to be sent to Syria, the chemical weapons watchdog says .

"(CNN) -- Israelis looking to know when to take cover are turning to their smartphones to get real-time notifications after Hamas fires rockets from Gaza. The Red Alert app co-created by Ari Sprung, an Israeli software developer born in the United States, has become increasingly popular as the conflict escalates. While the country's Iron Dome missile defense system intercepts most rockets, some do get through. As a live interview with Sprung and CNN's Brooke Baldwin began Wednesday, both phones -- one in Jerusalem, the other in Atlanta -- sounded in real time as rockets were fired toward the Israeli cities of Ashkelon and Ashdod. Sprung partnered with another Israeli software developer, Kobi Snir, after the 2012 escalated conflict between Israel and Hamas. ""We knew this would happen again, so we wanted to make sure we had an app ready to alert Israelis for the next conflict,"" Sprung told CNN. Red Alert receives notifications when rockets are being launched from Gaza, and automatically sends out a push notification to users via the downloaded app. Their phone will play an emergency tone and display the name of the targeted community. The free app is available on iOS and Android devices. Sprung works full time at a software development company, and tends to Red Alert in his free time. The servers are hosted for free by ShartimIsrael, an Israeli web hosting company, he says. For security reasons, the developers won't say how they get their notifications of rockets being launched. But they tell CNN the time delay is less than a second of when the audible sirens are sounded. At one point Tuesday, a rocket was being launched every six minutes. Life in Gaza: Search for safety, or wait for destiny . Once the app is downloaded, users can select which Israeli cities for which they want to get alerts. Most users select ""all areas."" Israeli officials and the Israel Defense Forces have publicly supported the app, and encourage people to download it. Before the latest Gaza operation, there were 60,000 Android users and 80,000 iPhone users, all in Israel. Today, Sprung tells CNN, there are approximately 290,000 Android users and 300,000 iPhone users worldwide, based on information from Apple's iTunes store and Google Play store. Of the 300,000 iPhone users, 250,000 are from Israel and 50,000 are in the United States and other countries. The Android app isn't available outside of Israel due to limited server space; instead users with an Android device wanting to receive updates can do so through the ""Yo"" app. Trapped in war: 'This is tyranny' Gilad Harazy, an Israeli native studying in the United States, has family back in Israel, and keeps up with developments through the app. ""I want to know when it hits close by where my parents live,"" he says. ""I know if it hits they won't be able to contact me immediately, so I want to be able to know to get in touch with them to make sure they're OK."" Harazy's family lives in the town of Nir-Banim, roughly 20 miles from the Israel-Gaza border. His parents have approximately one minute to seek shelter once the alerts go off, he says. The time it takes for Israeli's to seek shelter varies, based on how far they are from the Gaza border. ""It's great to be able to know on the spot when the alarm goes off,"" Harazy tells CNN. ""In Israel, you might be in a closed room not near the sirens, so this new app allows you to know when something's going on. Although I'm happy to be able to know when rockets fall, it's really sad to know we need something like this."" Racing toward danger: War-scarred Gaza medical crews also in harm's way .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- At least 70 people have been killed in another wave of the horrifying daily violence that is threatening to unravel Iraq, police officials around the country said. More than 40 were killed in Baghdad Monday, many of whom were on their way to the Shiite holy city of Karbala. Another 17 pilgrims in Mosul were also killed by militants. In Baghdad, at least 27 people were killed and more than 50 wounded when two car bombs exploded in quick succession near a procession of pilgrims making their way by foot to Karbala for the annual commemoration of the seventh century death of their Imam Hussein, a memorial called the Arbaeen. Hussein was killed during a battle near Karbala for control of the Muslim nation after Mohammed's death in 632. Hussein's death led to a split between Sunni and Shiite Muslims. The violence comes a day after at least 21 people died, including an anchor with al-Mousliya TV, in shootings and explosions, police said. The U.S. Embassy in Baghdad issued a statement to condemn ""the appalling acts of terrorism carried out against innocent victims in Iraq"" in the last two days. Also Monday, at least eight people were killed and four others wounded when a car bomb exploded outside a police station in Baiji, authorities in Tikrit told CNN. Militants freed at least 10 prisoners, authorities said. Minutes after the initial explosion, gunmen stormed the station and clashes erupted between them and Iraqi security forces, police officials said. Baiji is located about 200 miles (320 km) north of Baghdad in Salaheddin province. In nearby Tikrit, militants stormed the city council building, clashed with Iraqi security forces and occupied the facility for a time, police officials in the city said. Several hostages were freed, but at least five were killed. State-run Iraqia TV reported that an anti-terrorism unit freed some hostages and killed the militants.

"(CNN) -- Boston was strong. Too strong for the St. Louis Cardinals. The Red Sox, defeated the Cardinals 6-1 on Wednesday to win their eighth World Series title and cap a wicked good worst-to-first season that delighted a city dealing with the aftermath of the deadly bombings at its signature marathon in April. Shane Victorino drove in four runs with a bases-loaded double in the third and an RBI single in the fourth as Boston took the Series four games to two. Series MVP David Ortiz, walked four times -- three times intentionally -- and scored two runs for the Red Sox. A resurgent John Lackey pitched six strong innings before fading in the seventh and leaving with the bases loaded with a 6-1 lead. But reliever Junichi Tazawa got out Allen Craig to blunt the Cardinals' comeback attempt. In April at a remembrance ceremony for the victims of the bombing, it was Ortiz, known as Big Papi, who fired up the crowd. ""This jersey, that we wear today, it doesn't say 'Red Sox.' It says 'Boston,' "" Ortiz said, standing on the infield as the crowd cheered officers who were on the field. ""We want to thank you Mayor (Tom) Menino, Gov. (Deval) Patrick, the whole police department, for the great job that they did this past week. This is our f***ing city. And nobody's going to dictate our freedom. Stay strong,"" he said, echoing the newly minted ""Boston Strong"" motto. The Red Sox became only the second team in major league history to finish last in their division in one season and win the World Series the next year. In 1991, two worst-to-first teams met in the World Series with the Minnesota Twins edging the Atlanta Braves in seven games. It's the club's third World Series title in the last 10 seasons -- albeit the first that they've celebrated on their home field since 1918.","Shane Victorino drove in four runs for Boston in Game 6 .

"(CNN) -- The sound of heavy weapons and machine gun fire echoed through the night in the restive city of Al-Rastan after a large number of tanks moved in to block key roads and areas of town, an opposition activist said Monday. ""Several tanks have been in place since May at each of the entrances of the city, but Sunday a great number of tanks began blocking the agriculture parts of the town and the surrounding villages and even took positions inside Rastan,"" said the activist, a member of the opposition Local Coordinating Committees who could not be identified because of security concerns. Elsewhere in Syria, security forces captured and killed two activists in Qosair, a town in Homs province, according to the Local Coordinating Committees, the activist group that has been organizing anti-government protests. Students also continued their protests against the rule of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, chanting, ""No teaching, no learning until the fall of the regime"" in Homs, Daraa and Damascus provinces. In Al-Rastan, more than 50 tanks were in and around the city in the northwestern part of Homs province, said the activist, whose claims could not be independently verified. The inflow of security forces means opposition groups are having trouble treating their wounded, the opposition activist told CNN. ""We have a major problem now that even though Rastan has one of the largest hospitals in Homs province we are unable to take our wounded out of fear of retaliation by security forces. Currently five to six tanks surround the hospital and we believe they may detain the wounded,"" the activist said. People are scared to go to work in the area's industrial port because it has been surrounded by tanks and ""just this week a young man was shot and killed by security forces,"" the activist said. The Syrian government has been battling opposition activists for months in what the government calls a campaign against terrorists. At the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid Moallem blamed ""foreign incitement"" for the troubles, which he said were fueled by U.S. and European sanctions. ""This course cannot in any way be reconciled with pronouncements about concern for the interests, security and rights of the Syrian people,"" Moallem told the General Assembly. ""It further runs counter to the basic principles of human rights in defense of which these states base their interference in our internal affairs."" He said Syria had been ""a model of peaceful co-existence"" among its people's religious and ethnic groups, and that disturbing that peace was aimed at ""spreading Western hegemony over the countries of the Mediterranean and serving Israel's expansionist interests."" On Monday, the state-run news agency SANA published a report citing an unnamed military source saying that authorities found Israeli weapons, explosives and stolen military uniforms in Homs and recovered weapons, ammunition detonators and other military supplies hidden in a drum and a water tank in the garden of a house in Naseeb, a city in Daraa province. Military engineers also dismantled an explosive device next to Daraa University that could have killed more than 300 people, SANA reported. Nearly 3,000 people have died in the government's crackdown, according to some accounts.

And voters in Alaska and Oregon — two states that already allow medical marijuana and have decriminalized harsh sentencing for some recreational use — will likely vote on whether to join Colorado and Washington in allowing, taxing and regulating pot for recreational use. A look at marijuana laws in the U.S. There's not much of a smoke screen shrouding as to why some Democratic political strategists would want marijuana measures on ballots this year given President Barack Obama's low approval numbers and the party's historic slump in terms of turnout in midterm election years, marijuana policy analysts said. 'Young adults and legalization' ""It's nothing but politics,"" said Jon Gettman, an assistant professor of criminal justice at Shenandoah University. ""If anyone's electoral strategy is to bring out new voters, one area they would target is young adults and marijuana legalization."" That's because people under 30 are more likely to use and be arrested for pot, Gettman said. And, he added, young voter attitudes about legalizing marijuana also tends to cut across political ideologies and includes a cross section of liberals and libertarians. According to a Pew Research Center poll conducted in February, 70% of respondents between 18 and 29 believe marijuana should be legalized. Comparatively, 32% of people 65 and older support legalization. So, political operatives and their well-heeled backers have sallied forth, in part, with the hopes of hooking those elusive young voters with the allure of legalizing marijuana. For example, Oregon's petition drive, which the National Conference of State Legislatures said is gaining steam, is funded by New Approach Oregon. The group last year received $50,000 from the Drug Policy Alliance, an organization with ties to billionaire and pro-marijuana legalization advocate George Soros. Alaska's Begich in tight race . In Alaska, ""the finances were right"" to put money and effort into getting a ballot initiative, said Dan Riffle, director of federal policies for the Marijuana Policy Project, a pro-pot legalization group. In that state, Democratic Sen. Mark Begich is in a competitive race to keep his seat. Those who oppose marijuana legalization balk at the influence of big cash and election year pushes. ""It hasn't been a fair fight in terms of messaging. They've spent over $100 million to advocate this,"" said Kevin Sabet, an assistant professor at the University of Florida's Drug Policy Institute. ""It speaks to the money in marijuana politics."" Pot Politics . ""You have special interest groups lobbying, pollsters, public relations and marijuana companies that are funding this. They stand to make a lot of money if (marijuana legalizes nationally),"" said Sabet who served as a drug policy adviser to both Republican and Democratic administrations and is on the board of directors of Smart Approaches to Marijuana, an anti-pot legalization group. ""This is about creating the next big tobacco and getting rich off of other people's addictions."" In the effort to get marijuana-related ballot initiatives, pro-pot legalization advocates have also netted the support of older voters who perhaps may be more likely to suffer from ailments they hope marijuana can alleviate, and those who were born during the 1960s and 70s and bore witness to looser cultural attitudes about drug use, marijuana policy experts said. Drawing voters to polls . Pot measures are more likely to draw voters to the polls, said Chris Arterton, a political management professor at George Washington University who helped conduct a national poll in late March examining the issue. According to the poll ""39% of surveyed voters reported that they would be much more likely to turn out to the polls if there was a proposal to legalize the use of marijuana on the ticket. An additional 30% said that they would be somewhat more likely to vote in the election under that circumstance."" According to the poll, 40% of Republicans and 39% of Democrats say they would be strongly more likely to turn out, Arterton said. A CNN/ORC International poll conducted in January found that a little more than half of those surveyed — 55% — supports marijuana legalization. This is an increase from the 16% who supported legalization a quarter century ago. Legal in 21 states, DC . Medical marijuana is legal in 21 states and the District of Columbia, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. This year, 18 state governments had measures dealing with legalizing marijuana for recreational use, according to National Conference of State Legislatures. Some 15 states considered whether to create new medical marijuana laws, 14 weighed creating new medical marijuana programs and 14 considered decriminalizing marijuana, according to an analysis of current state marijuana legislation efforts performed by the National Conference of State Legislatures for CNN. Majority in Colorado say legalizing pot was good for state . Fewer than a dozen of the measures have been enacted, the analysis found. Meanwhile, the politics of putting an initiative on the ballot to legalize medical marijuana in Florida has proven hazy indeed. Crist running in Florida . Wealthy Orlando trial attorney John Morgan is helping bankroll not only the pot ballot initiative push and voter turnout efforts, but also the campaign of former Gov. Charlie Crist, a Republican-turned-Democrat, in his effort to reclaim that office. Morgan said he poured $4 million of his own money into the ballot effort to help people like his brother, who is a quadriplegic, and his father, who died from esophageal cancer, whose suffering was eased by medical marijuana. Republicans have cried foul over the connection and say Democratic operatives are just using pot as a ploy to turnout votes for Crist. ""I love Charlie Crist and I like Charlie Crist, but I don't like him $4 million dollars worth,"" Morgan told CNN. United for Care, the Morgan-backed organization behind the initiative also said the GOP is blowing smoke. ""It's a very cynical argument,"" said Ben Pollara, the group's director and a Democratic fundraiser who is also helping raise campaign cash for Crist. ""That has nothing to do with what we're doing."" Meanwhile, Republican Gov. Rick Scott, who trails Crist in the polls, stunned observers last week when, despite previously stating his opposition to legalizing medical marijuana, he vowed to sign into law a bill legalizing a limited version of the drug for some medicinal purposes. A Quinnipiac University poll conducted in late April found that 88% of Florida voters support legal medical marijuana use by adults, backing that was high among both young and elderly respondents. While advocates reject claims from the other side that they are being politically manipulative, they do acknowledge that politicians looking for a bump at the polls might do well to align themselves with the pro-pot legalization cause. The 2016 play . With an eye on the 2016 elections, Riffle's organization is already anticipating backing initiatives to tax and regulate marijuana for that year's ballot in Arizona, California, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada and possibly Montana. His organization's efforts ""might bring voters to the polls who might favor Crist in the election,"" Riffle said adding that politicians might want to take note. ""It's important because one of the ways we're gaining traction in Congress is that it is gaining popularity in states. Florida would be the second most populous marijuana state."" Guess which politicians have tried pot .","Critical battleground state of Florida, and others, have pot legalization on fall ballots .
Advocates say marijuana legalization measures could help with youth voter turnout .
Opponents accuse legalization advocates of using the issue to influence elections .
Florida's medical marijuana vote this fall could prove a watershed moment ."
"(CNN) -- Poland has expressed ""deep regret"" after rioters attacked Russia's embassy in Warsaw during Independence Day celebrations on November 11. The public holiday marks Poland's declaration of independence in 1918 after World War I, following more than 120 years of rule by Russia, Prussia and Austria. It fell under Soviet control after World War II until the Communist government was forced out 1989. Warsaw police said participants in a nationalist ""Independence March"" set alight a guard station at the embassy and tried to storm its gates. Marchers threw stones and fireworks at police trying to restore calm in the city, and 12 officers needed hospital treatment, police said. A total of 72 people were arrested in connection with the unrest, among them three suspected of involvement in the embassy incident. Russia said its embassy had been attacked by ""hooligans"" who had pelted the mission with ""flares, bottles and stones."" In a statement, it accused Polish authorities of allowing the march to take place without adequate security. In posts on Twitter, Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the Kremlin had summoned the Polish ambassador over the riots and given him a protest note saying the Vienna convention had been violated, after the Russian Embassy in Warsaw ""had been blocked for hours."" Warsaw police earlier said they had deployed 3,000 officers for Independence Day. Poland's Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed ""deep regret over the violent behavior and incidents that occurred near the Embassy of the Russian Federation in Warsaw."" It blamed the incident on Independence March participants, including the All-Polish Youth and the National Radical Camp. ""Such behavior directed at a diplomatic mission should be strongly condemned and is incompatible with 11 November Independence Day celebrations,"" it said in a statement. Meanwhile, three people were arrested in Russia after throwing smoke bombs and fireworks at Poland's embassy in Moscow in apparent retaliation for the Warsaw attack, according to state-run news agency RIA Novosti.","Poland expresses regret after rioters attack Russian Embassy in Warsaw .

"(CNN) -- A Cuban prisoner who went on hunger strike to protest his arrest for taking part in a demonstration died Thursday, according to other dissidents in the country. Wilmar Villar Mendoza, 31, died in a hospital in Santiago after his kidneys and other organs failed, said Yoani Sanchez , a prominent Cuban blogger and advocate of press freedom in the country. Sanchez said she had spoken with Villar Mendoza's widow, Maritza, by telephone. His death comes at an awkward time for President Raul Castro's government: another prisoner died after going on a hunger strike earlier this month, and Pope Benedict is due to visit Cuba in the coming months. A Cuban court sentenced Villar Mendoza to four years in prison in November, Sanchez said, a sentence he said he felt was unjust. Villar Mendoza started his hunger strike following his sentencing, halting it briefly in December when the authorities said they would listen to his demand for his case to be reconsidered, Sanchez said. Villar Mendoza's death was confirmed by the wife of another dissident and by the head of an opposition research organization inside Cuba, who could not be identified for security reasons. It happened just weeks after the death of another hunger striker, Rene Cobas, who began his protest because he was not part of the government's recent mass pardon. Cobas died of a heart attack on January 1 after authorities at the Boniato Prison, near Santiago, disregarded a doctor's recommendation that he be moved to a provincial hospital, according to Elizardo Sanchez, who heads the island's independent Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation. Cobas had gone on strike immediately after the president announced the latest round of amnesty on December 23. Cobas called the pardons ""exclusive and limited,"" Sanchez said. The decision to release 2,900 prisoners followed ""numerous requests"" from their family members and religious institutions, and was a humanitarian gesture, Castro said last month. He cited the upcoming visit of Pope Benedict as one of the motivations behind the move, which he said showed the ""generosity and strength of the revolution."" The pope has said he plans to visit Mexico and Cuba before Easter. Among those were to be freed were prisoners over the age of 60, along with those who were sick, female or young with no previous criminal record. With some exceptions, prisoners convicted of spying, terrorism, murder and drug trafficking would not be released. In 2010, Castro agreed to free 52 prisoners who had been arrested during a 2003 crackdown on political dissidents. That pardon was prompted by the death of a jailed dissident, Orlando Zapata Tamayo, following an 80-day hunger strike protesting inmate conditions. CNN's Catherine Shoichet contributed to this report.","A prisoner on hunger strike dies of organ failure, other Cuban dissidents say .

"(CNN) -- A video showing a blind man being repeatedly kicked and stomped by an unknown assailant was released by the Philadelphia Police Department Tuesday. The 33-year-old victim was walking down the street around noon on October 2 in Philadelphia's Southwest Germantown neighborhood when the suspect looked in his direction as he was approaching, according to police. The grainy police surveillance video shows the suspect laying down his backpack near a corner shop after he spots the victim. The video goes black, and the next moment shows the victim being pushed to the ground and repeatedly punched, stomped on and then kicked about four times by his attacker as witnesses watched. One man is seen crossing the street mere steps from the beating, and he continues walking. After the suspect finishes assaulting the blind man, he picks up his backpack and walks away, leaving the victim helpless on the ground with injuries to his head and face, according to police. Philadelphia police spokeswoman Officer Tanya Little said it was not clear whether the suspect knew that the victim was blind. The victim told police he did not recognize his attacker's voice. Police are asking the public to help identify the attacker, whom they described as a 20-year-old black man wearing a tan baseball cap, tan shirt and khaki pants.

"Minneapolis (CNN) -- Minneapolis is a conflicted city. It's home to one of the largest gay pride festivals in the Midwest and was once dubbed the ""gayest city in America"" by The Advocate magazine. The metropolitan area is also home to the conservative power base of Rep. Michele Bachmann. And in six months, voters there and across the state will decide whether to amend the state's constitution to ban same-sex marriage. It is one of four states where voters will cast ballots on the issue, along with Washington, Maine and Maryland. Across the nation, 29 states have approved constitutional amendments banning same-sex marriage. Six states and the District of Columbia allow same-sex marriages while five states allow civil unions between same-sex couples. Same-sex marriage by the numbers . President Barack Obama's May 9 announcement that he supports same-sex marriage helped mobilize activists for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community in Minnesota. The day after Obama spoke, ""more than twice as many"" people signed up to volunteer for Minnesotans United for All Families than on previous days, according to the group's campaign manager Richard Carlbom. Carlbom's group is working to defeat the November measure that would ban gay marriage. He said that even North Carolina voters' decision on May 8 to ban same-sex marriage there helped energize Minnesota's pro-LGBT lobby to get out the vote in November. ""[Obama's decision and North Carolina's vote] was an incredible one-two punch for us in Minnesota in terms of punching up the amount of energy,"" Carlbom said. He added that the goal is to capitalize on the energy from both events. Kate Wulf and her partner of 31 years Marianne Christianson, both volunteers for Minnesotans United for All Families, desperately want to see the amendment defeated for both political and personal reasons. ""North Carolina was kind of a wake-up call for everyone,"" Wulf said. She and Christianson were legally married in Canada, but they would like nothing more than to walk down the aisle -- and have their commitment for each other recognized -- in their home state. ""We want the equality of marriage that I don't think we should be denied according to the Constitution of this country,"" said Christianson. In his recent announcement, Obama said while he personally supports same-sex marriage, he still believes the issue should be decided by each state. That's something that Wulf and Christianson don't agree with. ""I think marriage is a fundamental right,"" Wulf said. ""(It) shouldn't be determined on a state-by-state basis."" Christianson said she's believes that won't be Obama's position forever. ""He had to start somewhere,"" Christianson added. ""And where he started right now is a good beginning. I'm hoping he will evolve into a stance where ... it is recognized nationwide."" The couple believes defeating the amendment will be an uphill battle, particularly when those on the opposing side have the resources of the Roman Catholic Church, they say. ""I'm hoping that we're going to see the goodness of people of Minnesota come out, but it's really hard to fight the church,"" Christianson said. ""They have a built-in organization."" Two years ago, the Minneapolis-St. Paul archdiocese sent out 400,000 DVDs to its parishioners urging them to support legislation banning same-sex marriage, even though the issue wasn't even on the ballot. So far, Catholic churches across the state have donated $350,000 to Minnesota for Marriage, a group that supports the constitutional ban on same-sex marriage, according to Jason Adkins, executive director of the Minnesota Catholic Conference, which represents the state's Catholic bishops. ""The various dioceses are giving money to the Minnesota Catholic Conference to use to support the marriage amendment,"" Adkins told CNN. ""We're going to raise and spend the money we need to get the message out about what marriage is, why it's important and what the consequences will be if it's redefined."" Advocacy groups opposed to same-sex marriage say their supporters also got a boost from Obama's comments. ""[President Obama's] comments ... alerted our base to the fact that there are politicians who are trying to meddle with the definition of marriage,"" said Chuck Darrell, communications director for Minnesota for Marriage. ""When they hear that they're motivated to get out and do something to pass the marriage amendment."" The group's chairman, John Helmberger, said it's too early to tell if there has been an increase in volunteers after Obama's statement. However, he agreed that the president's admission that he supports same-sex marriage will help Minnesota for Marriage rally supporters ahead of the November ballot. ""That will energize them to make phone calls, knock on doors, and to make sure they turn out in November,"" Helmberger said. While the recent media coverage of North Carolina's vote and Obama's comments have raised awareness of the issue, Minnesota for Marriage volunteer Michael Blissenbach said this did not affect how hard he's been campaigning against same-sex marriage. Blissenbach, 25, has been volunteering in support of the proposed amendment on behalf of the Catholic Church since August. He personally believes that marriage should be between a man and a woman because ""redefining marriage would diminish the importance of having the influence of the mother and the father on the life of a child."" ""I see marriage as an institution primarily oriented to the raising and procreation of children, and I see that as why the government recognizes marriage,"" Blissenbach said. He said that doesn't mean he is opposed to same-sex relationships. ""I respect their right to live as they wish, and I don't deny that there's love in those relationships,"" Blissenbach explained. ""But I see marriage as about a particular kind of love between a man and a woman that brings a child into the world."" While many predict this fight could get ugly as the two sides duke it out for the next six months, the same-sex marriage issue could also fade from voters' minds by the time the November election rolls around. After all, economic issues are expected to be the top issue for voters across the United States this fall. Either way, it could help the president gain some voters, according to University of Minnesota political science professor Larry Jacobs. ""Social issues including gay marriage are unlikely to affect voter choice between [Mitt] Romney and Obama,"" Jacobs said. ""But it could be a big tool for Obama to turn out disaffected Democrats who are likely to sit out the election."" However Minnesota's voters decide on the proposed constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage, the issue isn't going away anytime soon, Jacobs said. ""It doesn't mean that gay marriage is coming to a state near you,"" he said. ""But it does begin to shift the balance and reflects a very significant shift in public thinking about gay marriage.""

"Abidjan, Ivory Coast (CNN) -- The broadcast antennae for Ivory Coast's state news agency was targeted Saturday night by youths loyal to President-elect Alassane Ouattara, according to his representative to South Africa. Patrice Mallet told CNN that Ouattara supporters attacked Radiodiffusion-Television-Ivoirienne (RTI), calling it a ""tool"" used by disputed President Laurent Gbagbo ""to spread hate and xenophobia."" Mallet also accused Gbagbo's armed youth league, known as the Young Patriots, along with armed forces loyal to Gbagbo, of committing ""gross human rights violations"" over the past week and a half during fighting that has left the commercial capital, Abidjan, in an increasingly lawless situation. People have been burned alive or gunned down in public because they are supporters of Ouattara, Mallet said. In November, both incumbent Gbagbo and challenger Ouattara claimed victory in the presidential election run-off. An independent electoral commission declared Ouattara the winner, but Gbagbo has refused to step aside. Mallet said other rights abuses include using heavy artillery and rocket-launched grenades against protesters, the destruction of mosques, denial of medical care for Ouattara loyalists and the use of rape and sexual assault as a tactic. Gbagbo is also tracking down Ouattara backers on social networks and chat rooms, Mallet said. The Young Patriots are run by Charles Ble Goude, Gbagbo's minister of youth. On Friday, he called on Gbagbo supporters to impede the movement of United Nations forces around the country ""by any means."" There have also been clashes between Gbagbo and Ouattara supporters in the central cities, Yamoussoukro and Daoukro, in addition to ongoing fighting in Abidjan. But Ouattara loyalists have secured the border with Liberia to keep mercenaries out of the country, Mallet said. They have intercepted several groups trying to bring weapons -- including rocket launchers -- into the country, according to Mallet. Violence escalated sharply over the last week, after four African heads of state left Abidjan. They were given a mandate by the African Union to find a ""binding solution"" to the post-election crisis in Ivory Coast. Ouattara is holed up in the Golf hotel in Abidjan under the protection of U.N. peacekeepers. CNN's Christabelle Fombu contributed to this report .","Broadcast antennae for state-run RTI attacked .

"(CNN) -- Independent candidate Eliot Cutler conceded the Maine governor's race to Republican Paul LePage on Wednesday after results showed the two separated by less than 8,500 votes. Cutler, an attorney, said he spoke to LePage and told him ""it appeared he would be the winner."" With 97 percent of precincts reporting, LePage, currently the mayor of Waterville, garnered 38 percent of the vote to Cutler's 37 percent. Democrat Libby Mitchell, president of the state Senate, was a distant third with 19 percent. ""I didn't want to stand in his way,"" Cutler said of LePage. ""I didn't want to extend ... the uncertainty, because I didn't think it was good for him or the state. Obviously, if by some miracle official results change things, they do, but I don't expect it."" In an address to supporters Wednesday, LePage said his campaign ""stayed on message despite many ups and downs, some of my making."" ""I'm not a politician. I'm a businessman who served this community as mayor. I ran for governor because I believe the people of Maine need to be ahead of politics ... today the voters agreed: people before politics,"" he added. The current governor, Democrat John Baldacci, cannot serve another term due to term-limit laws in the state. Although Maine has trended Democratic in recent years, the governorship has steadily changed hands between Republicans, Democrats and independents for the past 50 years. In the century before that, Republicans dominated the office.","NEW: LePage pledges to put ""people before politics""

"(CNN) -- The Atlanta Braves are planning to leave downtown Atlanta. Beginning in 2017, the team will no longer play at Turner Field. It's building a new stadium in Cobb County up the highway to the northwest, where two major interstates -- I-75 and I-285 -- meet. ""We are extremely excited that our address will still be Atlanta and so will the name across our jersey,"" the team said in an announcement. The location is just outside Atlanta's city limits. ""We wanted to find a location that is great for our fans, makes getting to and from the stadium much easier, and provides a first-rate game day experience in and around the stadium,"" President John Schuerholz said in a video message. The team's contract with Turner Field -- which was retrofitted for baseball after the 1996 Olympics -- expires in 2016.

"Washington (CNN) -- As members of Congress point to problems with HealthCare.gov, lawmakers are scrambling and, in and some cases, sparking cries of hypocrisy over how they'll handle one piece of Obamacare under their control: whether their own staff members should be forced into the exchanges. Members of Congress have until the end of the day on Thursday to make up their minds, and Democrats and Republicans are divided internally on the politically tricky issue. ""We just learned (Monday) that we have to make the decision this week,"" one House Republican leadership aide told CNN. Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Robert Menendez, D-New Jersey, told CNN on Tuesday, ""I'm not sure where we're at."" His staff was still unsure of his decision on Wednesday night. Meantime, despite Democrats' defense of Obamacare and Republican insistence that members of Congress and their staff should directly experience the law they passed, some powerful lawmakers plan to exempt their workers from the requirement that they enter the exchanges. Example? House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa wants to keep his entire staff -- committee and personal office -- out of the exchanges, according to a House Republican aide familiar with his thinking. The aide defended the idea as consistent, saying Issa believes that no American should have to enter Obamacare exchanges. Interpreting the law . And if lawmakers do nothing by the deadline Thursday night, committee staff and leadership staff will be automatically exempted due to an interpretation by congressional administrators. Part of the issue involves semantics and how Congress wrote the law. The 2010 Affordable Care Act mandates that ""members of Congress and congressional staff"" must get health care through an Obamacare exchange. But the Office of Personnel Management has ruled that it's up to individual members to designate which of their workers are ""congressional staff."" Most assume a member's ""personal"" or district staff fit the definition. But there is a messy disagreement over what should happen with the more than 2,000 people who work for committees or leadership offices. Some argue those workers aren't as directly tied to individual members. Others insist that argument is just a giant loophole for staffers who are nervous and want to avoid the exchanges. But put aside the question of logic -- the bottom line is that each member of Congress can do what he or she wants. Exempted by default . And if lawmakers don't act, many staffers will be exempted by default. An internal administrative policy provides that committee and leadership staff will be exempted from the exchange automatically, according to a Senate aide and an internal House e-mail obtained by CNN. The House e-mail, sent by the chamber's chief administrative officer (CAO) Monday, said that office is interpreting ""congressional staff"" to mean individuals who are paid from the members' individual office budgets, not leadership or committee funds. That gives some members their justification. ""The committees are exempted (from the exchange requirement),"" Oklahoma Sen. Tom Coburn, the ranking Republican on the Homeland Security Committee, insisted to CNN. Because of Coburn's view, his committee staff members can keep their current federal employee health plan. ""I think it's clear,"" Coburn said. But what some call clear, others see as self-serving or hypocritical. ""I would submit that's ludicrous on its face,"" Sen. David Vitter, R-Louisiana, said of the committee exemption argument on the floor on Wednesday. ""Congressional staff are congressional staff. ... Anyone who works for us through the institution of Congress."" On the other side, Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, the top Republican on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, told CNN on Tuesday that he thinks ""we're going to keep the committee staff"" on the current federal employee plan. ""I haven't made up my mind,"" Hatch said. Democrats are similarly split. Senate Budget Committee Chairman Patty Murray, D-Washington, will have her leadership and committee staff go into the exchange. But what about fellow Democrat and Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus of Montana? His office says he believes committee staff is exempt. The issue is a double-edged sword for lawmakers: exempt your staff and face accusations of granting them a special privilege or force your staff into the exchanges and risk losing good workers who fear the exchanges will provide weaker or costlier benefits. Last-minute decisions . Many of the most powerful waited until this week to make the tough decision. House Republican leaders were still discussing options on Tuesday. Then by Wednesday, Speaker John Boehner and his top lieutenants decided to put their leadership staff into the exchanges, according to spokesmen for the various leaders. Senate Democratic leaders may be less united. While Murray and Democratic Whip Richard Durbin, D-Illinois, are both forcing their entire staff into the exchanges, Senate Leader Harry Reid's office did not answer CNN's questions about his plan. As for staffers themselves, feelings about joining the exchanges range from ""meh"" to sharp anxiety. None would speak on the record with CNN, saying they were not authorized to discuss their opinions with reporters. But several aides said they were extremely nervous about the exchange idea because it was untried. One indicated he had started thinking of looking for a new job because of the predicament. Others insisted they either had not thought about the exchange idea much or felt that it would be similar to the federal health plan they have now. To try to and guarantee a plan equal to current federal benefits, the Office of Personnel Management requires that congressional staffers in the exchange buy a plan at the ""gold"" benefit level or above. The same rule also mandates that congressional staffers use the Washington, D.C., health exchange to find a plan. Those rules will apply to some staffers and not others, depending on how individual members of Congress decide, one-by-one.","Some members of Congress undecided on which staff will go into Obamacare exchanges .
The way the law is written creates some ambiguity in which staff members are affected .
If lawmakers fail to act, their staff members are automatically exempted and keep federal plan ."
"Washington (CNN) -- Air travelers aren't likely to notice visible security changes as a result of a terrorism threat alert issued Friday by the State Department. The extraordinary global travel alert advised that al Qaeda may launch attacks in the Middle East, North Africa and beyond in coming weeks, and the U.S. government prepared to close 21 embassies and consulates from Algeria to Bangladesh on Sunday as a precaution. Three sources told CNN that the United States has information that Yemen-based al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula was in the final stages of planning for an unspecified attack. ""U.S. citizens are reminded of the potential for terrorists to attack public transportation systems and other tourist infrastructure. Terrorists have targeted and attacked subway and rail systems, as well as aviation and maritime services,"" the State Department's alert said. Airlines said they haven't changed operations as a result of the alert. The alert is focused on U.S. citizens traveling abroad, and the State Department suggested that travelers register with its Smart Traveler Enrollment Program, also known as STEP, which allows them to receive updated security information. Airlines for America (A4A), the airline industry trade group, said is monitoring the situation and suggested that passengers could also sign up for travel notifications from their airlines . Delta Air Lines, which has one daily roundtrip flight between JFK Airport and Tel Aviv and one between Atlanta and Dubai, said it is operated with ""Business as usual, for now."" United Airlines, which flies to North Africa and the Middle East, says there have been no flight schedule changes as the result of the warning. It says it is monitoring the situation and keeping in regular contact with the Transportation Security Administration and State Department. It isn't offering waivers for travelers wanting to change their flight, but that policy could change as the airline receives additional information. American Airlines said it has no flights to Africa or the Middle East, ""therefore we have nothing to waive.""","Airlines say they haven't changed operations as a result of the alert .

""Seven score and ten years ago, the forefathers of this media institution brought forth to its audience a judgment so flawed, so tainted by hubris, so lacking in the perspective history would bring, that it cannot remain unaddressed in our archives,"" the editors of The Patriot-News wrote Thursday, evoking the opening words and style of Lincoln's most famous speech. Back then, the editors of the Patriot & Union newspaper -- an ancestor of today's Harrisburg paper -- thought so little of Lincoln's ""silly remarks"" that they hoped ""the veil of oblivion shall be dropped over them, and that they shall be no more reposted or thought of."" Oopsie. History didn't cooperate. While mildly received on its delivery, the November 19, 1863, speech marking the consecration of the national cemetery at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, has gone on to become one of the most famous pieces of writing in the American canon -- inscribed on monuments, taught to schoolchildren and frequently surfacing in cultural references. ""Four score and seven years ago,"" Lincoln wrote in the speech's famous opening line, ""our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal."" Filmmaker Ken Burns recently urged all Americans to learn and recite the speech, calling the address ""some of the most important words ever spoken."" Americans reciting the Gettysburg Address . And so, on Thursday, the newspaper set the record straight: . ""The world will little note nor long remember our emendation of this institution's record -- but we must do as conscience demands,"" the newspaper wrote. ""In the editorial about President Abraham Lincoln's speech delivered Nov. 19, 1863, in Gettysburg, the Patriot & Union failed to recognize its momentous importance, timeless eloquence, and lasting significance. The Patriot-News regrets the error.""","Pennsylvania newspaper called Lincoln's remarks ""silly words"" 150 years ago .
That newspaper's successor has retracted its editorial .

"(CNN) -- Four months after Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick signed a new law banning ""upskirting,"" police have made their first arrest. Joshua Gonsalves, 23, was the first person in the state to be charged under the new law, according to Joe Pesaturo, spokesman for the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority (MBTA). MBTA police were called to the Forest Hills MBTA station in Jamaica Plain, a neighborhood of Boston, on Tuesday afternoon for a report of a man taking photos up a woman's dress, according to MBTA police. When police arrived they questioned the 26-year-old victim who told officers that while she was standing in the upper busway she felt ""something"" brush against her knees. When she looked down she saw a man's hand ""between her legs, holding an Apple iPad with the camera on facing up her skirt,"" according to police. The victim provided a detailed description of the suspect, including turning the table on the man by taking photos of him as he walked away, according to a statement from the Suffolk County district attorney's office. Police found Gonsalves on a bus shortly after and questioned him. He admitted to the deed, according to police, and stated to officers he had previously heard on the news it was not illegal to ""take pictures up a girl's skirt."" Five months ago, Gonsalves would have been right. Criminalizing ""upskirting"" stemmed from a case against Michael Robertson, 32, who was arrested in 2010 for allegedly taking photos up an undercover officer's dress, according to court documents. The charges against him were eventually dropped because Massachusetts' highest court ruled that Robertson did not violate state law when he took photos up the skirt of a woman because she was not nude or partially nude, as stipulated by an old state law against secretive photography. Intense media scrutiny followed and state lawmakers quickly called for a revision to the statute. They passed a bill making ""upskirting"" illegal and the governor signed it into law on March 7. So what is ""upskirting""? It is the ""secret photographing, videotaping, or electronic surveillance of another person's sexual or other intimate parts, whether under or around a person's clothing or when a reasonable person would believe that the person's intimate parts would not be visible to the public,"" Patrick's office said in a prepared statement in March. Gonsalves pleaded not guilty on Wednesday to violating the ""upskirting"" law and ordered held on $150 bail. He was also ordered to stay away from MBTA property, including buses and trains. If convicted, Gonsalves could face a sentence of 2Â½ to 5 years and up to a $5,000 fine. After Wednesday's court proceeding, Gonsalves' attorney, Charles Pappas, spoke briefly to CNN affiliate WCVB. ""I believe in the police report it was quoted that he (Gonsalves) had either heard on the news or read online that this was not illegal, but ... I haven't really gotten into detail with him about that,"" Pappas said. CNN's Dave Stewart, Haimy Assefa and Ray Sanchez contributed to this report.","""Upskirting"" involves secretly recording or photographing another's intimate areas in public .

"London (CNN) -- It was the art discovery that stunned the world: more than 1,400 works of art, many of them masterpieces, hidden away for over 70 years, unearthed not in a high-security vault or long-forgotten museum basement, but an anonymous apartment in an upscale German neighborhood. A vast stash of paintings by the likes of Picasso, Matisse and Chagall, some previously unknown, others that had been presumed lost forever. Their worth is thought to be upwards of $1 billion. The cache was uncovered by German tax authorities who raided the property in the Munich district of Schwabing in February 2012 as part of an investigation into allegations of tax evasion, but its existence remained a closely-guarded secret until this week. As details of the paintings -- and claims they may have been looted by the Nazis -- begin to emerge, one mystery remains: just who is the man behind this remarkable collection? The apartment where the haul was hidden belongs to an 80-year-old art lover named Cornelius Gurlitt; he has long since vanished, leaving relatives and neighbors -- as stunned as everyone else by the contents of his outwardly modest home -- to piece together his story. They paint a picture of a solitary and enigmatic man, whose only love was art. ""For me he was a 'lonesome cowboy,'"" says his cousin Ekkeheart, who last saw Gurlitt more than 30 years ago, and now lives in Spain. ""He had no friends. He was very strange. The only thing I think that was interesting for him was his paintings."" Ekkeheart remembers Gurlitt as ""a very elegant man,"" always impeccably turned out, carrying an ivory-topped cane, but always with an air of mystery about him. ""He never let us in to his flat -- nobody,"" he told CNN. ""When we met him we always met at some fancy place... never in his flat. I wondered... why can't we stay there, but 'no, no, it's not possible.' Read more: Unknown Matisse, Chagall artworks in 'Nazi-looted' haul . ""So of course you think, 'he never lets us in, perhaps he has some secrets...' If you're a mystery man people think all kinds of mystery things about you."" He says the family knew that Gurlitt worked as an art restorer, but insists they had no idea about the treasure trove of paintings he had squirreled away. ""We knew he was restoring paintings, but we thought maybe he had 100 or so... paintings going in and out, so people didn't wonder, but nobody knew -- not even us -- that he had 1,400-and-something pictures in his flat, in 90 square metres, imagine! Nobody had seen it because he didn't let anybody in."" According to land registry checks carried out by Paladin Associates and seen by CNN, the Munich apartment isn't the only property owned by Gurlitt; he and his sister Benita also own another home in a smart suburb of Salzburg, Austria. Art-obsessed recluse . No one answered the door when CNN paid a visit to the house this week, but a neighbor said he hasn't seen Gurlitt for several years. He remembers a reclusive man, apparently obsessed with art. ""He never greeted anyone and would just drive by, keeping to himself,"" the neighbor told CNN. ""He always seemed grumpy and would never really be out in public... He would always quickly retreat into his house and never really had any visitors."" While Gurlitt appears to have lived a largely secret life for decades, his father Hildebrand, who is thought to have amassed the huge collection of paintings, was well known in the German art world of the 1930s and 1940s. According to statements Hildebrand Gurlitt gave to the Allies in June 1945, he had been employed to buy art for the Nazis. Previously, he'd lost two jobs -- first as director of the city art gallery in Zwickau, eastern Germany, and then as head of Hamburg's Art Association -- because of his partially Jewish heritage. Documents published on lootedart.com, the website of the Central Registry of Information on Looted Cultural Property 1933-1945, reveal that the allied forces confiscated more than 100 artworks from Hildebrand in the aftermath of the Second World War. Read more: Art looted by Nazis 'found in German apartment' The pieces -- including works by Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, Gustave Courbet, Jean-Honore Fragonard and Edgar Degas -- were later returned after Hildebrand strongly denied holding Nazi beliefs and insisted the paintings and other art objects were the legal property of his family. In a checklist which forms part of his statement to the Allies, Hildebrand reports owning a Picasso painting ""bought from the artist"" in Paris in 1942 for 60,000 francs, while a work by Chagall was said to be an ""old possession of my sister."" The 1945 inventory and other lists compiled by Hildebrand when applying to reclaim his collection also include several pieces by artists condemned as ""degenerate"" by the Nazis: Otto Dix, Emil Nolde, Max Beckmann and George Grosz. In statements backing his calls for the return of the works, several people wrote of Gurlitt's interest in art forbidden under the Nazi regime. In a letter dated March 1946, Friedrich Schreiber-Weigand, director of the city art collection of Chemnitz, in eastern Germany, reported that Gurlitt ""took the side of the condemned 'Degenerate Art' and saved many a masterpiece of this kind by bringing it into private ownership."" Hildebrand finally secured the return of his artworks in 1950-51. He died a few years later in 1956, leaving them -- together with hundreds of other pieces -- in his son's hands. Their origin is unclear. Cornelius Gurlitt appears to have guarded the collection ferociously, keeping it out of sight for decades. ""He could have sold them to a rich man, or made a foundation, or sold them to a museum,"" says his cousin Ekkeheart. ""He had Picasso, Otto Dix, Marc Chagall, everything. He could have sold [them] if he was interested to make money... ""[Instead] He's said I am the one that has something unique that nobody has. Not you and not you, and I'm not prepared to show these treasures, all my treasures, all my babies. I don't want to show it to anybody.""

"(CNN) -- Entrepreneurs gathering for London's inaugural Technology Week have set the city's east end abuzz. As the event winds up, CNN has tapped five of tech's leading minds to reveal how they see the future of technology -- and whether London can stand its ground against tech centers like Silicon Valley. From home-made computers to money transfers, the five represent the disruption of established norms. They are creating better, more streamlined ways to operate in the modern world -- and inspiring those who follow in their path. London is seen as a laggard to its U.S. counterparts, but the emergence of the city's east end as a tech hub is helping inject energy into the sector. And according to the five -- Alex Klein of Kano, Ben Medlock of Swiftkey, Kathryn Parsons of Decoded, Michael Kent of Azimo and Emily Brooke of Blaze -- London is making its mark on the global tech stage. Klein, who has created a build-your-own computer kit, says London still ""has a lot to learn from the Valley, but it's got its own tricks -- brilliant design talent, and close cooperation in government."" And, as Klein notes, geography is decreasing in importance as the world changes into one where entrepreneurs can ""self-teach, open-source, and crowdfund."" Parsons, who is determined to demystify coding and make it available to all, says London's fame across so many sectors -- fashion, finance and media, for example -- is now spreading to technology. Emily Brooke, of bike safety innovators Blaze, agrees, noting this is particularly the case with hardware. ""There is a growing community of people ""building things""' in London,"" she told CNN. And ""as a globally recognized design capital, London is the perfect place to do it from."" London is, indeed, at the heart of Britain's tech scene, Medlock says. The man behind one of the hottest keyboard apps on the market says it ""attracts some of the best global talent, it's got a great vibe and a growing early stage investment culture."" But there's work to be done, he adds. ""We're a generation behind but we're catching up."" London is the ""best place in the world"" to start a financial tech business, according to Michael Kent, of international money transfer start-up Azimo. But, like Medlock, he remains cautious. According to Kent, the venture capital scene needs to ""grow up"" or see the ""U.S. firms come over and eat their lunch."" READ MORE: UK tech companies to watch .

"ONDO, Nigeria (CNN) -- In the dark of the early morning, the assembled drug agents murmur a short prayer before setting out on an early morning drugs raid. A agent torches marijuana plants found in the Nigerian forests but there could be hundreds more farms. After a few short orders, we set off into the deep undergrowth of southern Nigeria's forests on a tip-off that somewhere ahead are hidden farms illegally growing cannabis. ""It's dangerous because some of them have machetes and in the deeper forest they have pump action shotguns that they use,"" explained Gaura Shedow, Nigeria's narcotics commander for Ondo state. Nigeria's National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, or NDLEA, are battling to stop drugs illegally transited through the country, from Latin America and Asia into Europe and the U.S., spilling over into the streets of Nigeria. As we approach the farm, orders go for out for silence and torches out. The agents spill into an opening in the dense forest, and in the red-glow of the rising sun we can make out the unmistakable leaf of the marijuana plant. NDLEA suspects there may be hundreds of farms hidden in the forest - estimating the crop they've found this morning to be about $6,000. Despite NDLEA's efforts the farmers are nowhere to be seen, but Commander Gaura remains practical. ""The people that stay in these farms are not the big people. The big men stay in the cities -- they don't even come to the farmlands."" Nigeria is on the frontline in the global war on drugs -- an international gateway for cocaine from Latin America and heroin from Asia to abusers in Europe and the United States. It's not known exactly how much is transited through Nigeria but NDLEA says last year they seized over 300 tons of narcotics. Focusing primarily on the main transit points -- roads, ports and airports - NDLEA claim to have convicted over 1,800 traffickers. Most of them are Nigerian. ""We do have a big expatriate community of Nigerians in Europe and United States,"" explains Dagmar Thomas at the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime in Nigeria. ""And there is always the danger that these communities are tapped into by organized crime cartels."" We spoke to one man arrested for trying to trafficking cocaine to Europe. A young graduate, he explained how after losing his job in Spain he was tempted by the offer of $5,000 to transport cocaine packets in his stomach. ""When you are swallowing - taking in this thing into your body it's just as if you are signing your death warrant ... but this is what many youths do today just to make a living."" And with low-ranking NDLEA officers paid on average $200 a month corruption within the agency is a key concern. ""Yes, certainly there was a lot -- a lot, I think -- of corruption in the agency,"" explained Ahmadu Giade, the agency's chairman. ""But so long as I continue as chairman of the agency, so long I will continue to dismiss anybody who's involved in corruption -- I will never spare him."" But neither do the drugs. Living under a bridge in Nigeria's over-crowded metropolis, Lagos, Mercy Jon sleeps behind a public toilet with five other people. She prostitutes herself to pay for her cocaine habit. ""Cocaine has destroyed my life - if it was not for the cocaine I'm taking, I would not be in such a place because I'm a learned somebody. My parents spent a lot to make sure I go to school, but because of cocaine I've ruined everything."" Mercy Jon is being helped by one of only a handful of drug rehabilitation centers in Lagos -- Freedom Foundation. But struggling to find funding to cope with the number of addicts, their founder Tony Rapu is seeing a disturbing trend. ""I actually think its increasing -- in the past few years we've seen more cases of heroin and cocaine abuse and in the area of marijuana it's like its getting even more common."" Watching his officers systematically set about cutting and burning the seized cannabis crop Commander Gaura gestures to the flames. ""We prefer to get to the grass roots and cut it down before it gets to the streets."" But with the farmers and drug barons still in hiding Nigeria's drug war is far from over.","Nigerian drug agents patrol southern forests hunting for hidden drug farms .

"(CNN) -- An eighth case of meningitis has been reported at Princeton University, the school said Friday, the latest in a string of cases reported this year. ""Health officials will be conducting tests to determine if this latest case is related to the seven cases of meningitis associated with the University since March,"" university spokesman Martin Mbugua said in an e-mail. A female student at the New Jersey-based Ivy League school was taken to a local hospital Thursday after developing symptoms Wednesday night and is receiving treatment. All seven other cases of meningitis found at Princeton since March were caused by a rare meningococcal bacteria known as serotype B. Princeton said Monday that the school was preparing to provide a vaccine to protect against this strain of meningitis, pending final approval from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The vaccine for meningitis B is not licensed in the United States, but it has been approved in Europe and Australia. If the CDC approves, the vaccine would be recommended for all undergraduates and graduate students living in dormitories, as well as other members of the university community with conditions where the spleen is compromised, or certain other immune system disorders. That would apply to about 5,000 undergraduates and 550 graduate students in dorms, Mbugua said. Additionally, around half a dozen people with conditions that fall under the recommendation would also be affected, although there may be more who have not yet disclosed their conditions, he said. New Jersey state law requires all students at Princeton living in dormitories to receive a different meningitis vaccine, one that is licensed in the United States. That vaccine protects against some other strains, but not serotype B bacteria. Two doses of the unlicensed vaccine -- called Bexsero and made by Novartis -- are required to protect individuals against meningitis B. Princeton hopes to make the first two doses of the vaccine available in early December, and the second in February. Also this week, the University of California, Santa Barbara, reported that three students were being treated for meningococcal disease, and that their cases were caused by type B bacteria -- the same bacteria strain causing the Princeton outbreak. However, no link has been found between the California cases and those at Princeton, the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department said. What is meningitis B? Meningitis is an infection of the membranes that cover the brain and the spinal cord, known as the meninges. There are two forms of meningitis: bacterial and viral. The bacterial form is rare in the United States, and the group B bacterial strains are even more rare. Meningitis can spread via the exchange of saliva and other respiratory secretions through kissing, coughing, sharing drinks and living in close quarters, such as in dormitories, according to the New Jersey state health department. Symptoms can include stiff neck, headache, fever, vomiting, rashes, sensitivity to light and confusion. Untreated, the disease can lead to complications such as hearing impairment, brain damage, limb amputations and death. Antibiotic treatment of the most common types of bacterial meningitis ""should reduce the risk of dying from meningitis to below 15%, although the risk remains higher among young infants and the elderly,"" according to the CDC. In 2012, there were 480 cases of bacterial meningitis in the United States, according to the CDC. Of those, 160 were group B. School activities continue . Several students told CNN that their peers are not overly afraid of getting meningitis, but that it's definitely a topic of conversation. ""I think students do know that it is an important and fatal issue that is spreading on campus - and each student individually decides to what degree to protect themselves,"" Stephen Cognetta, a junior, said in an e-mail. He and others said they probably would sign up for the meningitis B vaccine if it becomes available. ""If the vaccine was offered and if there is enough scientific evidence proving its effectiveness, I would take it to reduce risk of infection,"" he said. Thanksgiving break at Princeton begins Tuesday after classes, and the semester at ""Old Nassau"" resumes December 2. ""At this time, the CDC and state health officials recommend that travel plans and activities on the Princeton University campus continue as planned, and the surrounding community can continue to attend events on the Princeton campus,"" Mbugua said.

"(CNN) -- Even as the head of the Young Republicans at Samford University, Weathers Veazey didn't have a lot of time for politics this primary season. Immersed in tough pre-law classes at the conservative Baptist university in Birmingham, Alabama, she barely paid attention to the nonstop political ads that ran on TV during the state's presidential primary. ""Classes are all-consuming for college students,"" Veazey said. ""We don't have a lot of time to watch TV."" What would have caught her attention? Ads sent directly to her smartphone. ""I would definitely have clicked on an ad texted to me,"" she said. ""That's a perfect way to reach college students. We always have our cellphones in our backpacks or in our hands."" That's what digital political guru Vincent Harris was counting on when he sent the campus conservative-themed text ads for former House Speaker Newt Gingrich before the Alabama primary. He says his ads typically said things like ""Stop Obama's War on Religion"" or ""Newt Gingrich: a Man of Faith."" Some were as simple as ""Bulldogs for Gingrich,"" with a clickable ""Help the Campaign"" button. ""In the industry, Yahoo will tell you that a 0.2 or 0.3% click-through rate for ads is considered successful,"" Harris told CNN. ""With the Samford campaign I created, those ads were getting a 4% click-through rate. That meant the people we needed to mobilize were seeing our message. It was an enormous success."" Political advertising has gone mobile this election season, which means you're likely to see more political ads texted to you, particularly if you live in a swing state. ""These are sophisticated online campaigns that consider mobile an essential element of what they are doing,"" said Kate Kaye, who wrote the book ""Campaign '08: A Turning Point for Digital Media."" ""The last time around it was much more of a -- well, 'novelty' might not be the right word. They were much more in an experimental mode."" In the 2008 presidential campaign, Barack Obama's digital team generated headlines when he announced his running mate via a text message. There was even more mobile organizing going on quietly behind the scenes, according to Kaye. Obama's digital team sent out early voting reminders to supporters' phones. Texts pointed people to the nearest voter registration drive. His campaign even bought ad space in some swing states on 1-800-FREE411. That meant when people called requesting a number for the nearest pizza delivery, they first had to listen to an Obama ad. Chris Newell, who ran mobile efforts for Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential run, says its text-messaging campaign debuted two months before Obama's did. ""While the Obama people run a sophisticated campaign now, we think they were sitting on the fence about texting until they saw Hillary pull out her phone at an event in New York, and there -- live on TV -- she told voters that's how they could reach her now,"" said Newell, who now runs ImpulsePay, a mobile payment site in the UK. Newell admits the campaign was still learning back then how to most effectively use the technology. One important lesson, which still holds up today, is that the most effective texts help the campaign feel more personal. ""We learned, 'Hello, will you please vote for me?' wouldn't work,"" Newell said. ""What does appeal is, 'I need your help,' or 'Help get this message out,' or 'What do you think of this issue?'"" Newell said the text campaigns generated thousands of volunteers. He reports about 30% of the people who received the texts clicked on them. Sometimes, though, old-fashioned technology can't keep up with demand. Newell said the Clinton campaign once sent a text that asked people to join a conference call to discuss a certain issue. Thousands jammed up the lines, but the call only allowed 2,000 people in. ""The flip side is, politicians saw the power of this kind of advertising right there, and they saw this as an immediate way to mobilize thousands of volunteers,"" he said. ""They were sold."" Zac Moffatt, digital director for presumptive GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, says mobile devices are now so powerful that he can do a lot more with a mobile campaign than he could back in 2008. He says 10% of Romney's advertising budget was spent on digital efforts during the 2012 primary season. ""Screens are so much larger and we can send a much more dynamic message to people now,"" said Moffatt. Romney was the only candidate in the 2012 primaries with a mobile-specific campaign site, he said. Moffatt also designed a mobile ad campaign to heavily target people involved in the Iowa caucuses. ""We sent these ads with a click-to-call button to find out where the closest caucus was,"" he said. ""I think we use mobile a little bit differently than the other campaigns. We built the site for what we call the 'Google moment of truth' when people are using their phones to search for an answer about the campaign,"" he added. ""Our mobile site is really stripped down. It is simpler, but we think provides a better user experience."" A spokeswoman for Obama's re-election campaign says the campaign doesn't discuss its mobile strategy. But Obama, who drew acclaim for his savvy use of digital media in 2008, is once again using mobile tools such as text messaging to communicate with supporters. People who download the Obama 2012 mobile app on their GPS-enabled devices if they opt in are essentially allowing the campaign to track their location, which could let strategists target messages to voters in certain areas. But in 2012, voters don't even need to opt into campaigns to receive these kinds of political texts. Technology is so advanced that campaigns can target anyone who has enabled geolocation services on their smartphone, and pinpoint their location within a three-yard radius, said Harris, who also ran digital operations for Texas Gov. Rick Perry during the 2012 primary campaigns. Many people, he said, don't even realize they've made their cell phone findable, although they've downloaded apps like Fandango or Yelp to help them locate the nearest movie or restaurant. For a conservative client, Harris will target phones on conservative campuses, as he did with his Samford University campaign. Or if his candidate in Plano, Texas, wants to get his message out to one particular neighborhood, Harris will set the text to ping only phones in the local Panera restaurant at lunchtime, for example. His latest trick? Target people who have downloaded apps that are philosophically in keeping with a conservative message. For the Perry campaign in Iowa, he sent an ad to everyone in the state who had downloaded a Bible app. ""Folks who got those texts were signing up to support Perry at a fantastic conversion rate,"" said Harris, who heads Harris Media, a digital marketing firm. ""That's a very successful campaign, I can tell you."" Overall, mobile outreach seems to be connecting with voters. After the 2010 midterm elections, a Pew Research Center poll found more than a quarter of the American adults they surveyed had used their mobile phones to learn more about, or even to participate in, the elections. And as phones become more sophisticated, the number of people who learn about elections on their phones is sure to grow. ""There is no excuse as to why candidates are not doing this,"" Harris said. ""It's that easy.""","Campaigns are increasingly targeting voters in specific locations with text-message ads .

"(CNN) -- Torrential flooding this week in the western Saudi Arabian city of Jeddah continues to disrupt life in the region as schools were set to close on Saturday, according to the nation's state news. Rescue operations were ongoing and at least 10 people died related to the flooding, with three missing in Jeddah, said Director General of Civil Defense, General Saad bin Abdullah Al-Tuwaijri, according to state news Saudi Press Agency Friday. Ground teams rescued 1,451 people, helicopters rescued 498 residents, and more than 1,500 families were provided temporary shelter, according to Al-Tuwaijri. Jeddah province received 111 mm (4 inches) of rain in three hours on Wednesday, according to the King Abdulaziz University's Meteorology Department. After taking a tour of flood-ravaged areas of Jeddah on Thursday, the Governor of Makkah Region, Prince Khalid Al-Faisal told reporters that damage was attributed to the lack of a drainage system for flooding and rain water. He said helicopters rescued 466 people by air on Wednesday night and ground teams evacuuted 951 residents from the worst hit neighborhoods of Jeddah -- Altawfeeq, Alsamer, Alnakheel, Alhamrah, Alkandarah and Ummal Khair. Video from Jeddah showed rushing water through the streets carrying cars and people downstream. Shops and offices were closed and boarded up to try and prevent the flooding from reaching inside buildings. Approximately 5,000 residents remained without power as of Thursday afternoon after power was restored to 65,000 customers, according to the Saudi Electricity Company, as reported by SPA. In November of 2009, nearly 100 people died from flooding in western Saudi Arabia. The deaths occurred the port city of Jeddah, Rabigh, north of Jeddah, and in the Mecca region, Saudi authorities said. The flooding was during the Hajj pilgrimage, but no pilgrims were killed on their journey. CNN Weather reports did not forecast more rain for Jeddah for the weekend.","Thousands of people have been rescued .

"(CNN) -- American Nate Henn, who was killed in the Uganda bomb blasts, advocated for the rights of children forced into fighting in the east African country, a California nonprofit group said Monday. The 25-year-old former University of Delaware rugby player joined the nonprofit Invisible Children last year and spent much of his time as an unpaid volunteer, traveling with the group around the United States, said spokesman Jedidiah Jenkins. He became close friends with one of group's success stories -- a 20-year-old Ugandan named Innocent. Henn had arrived to Uganda last week on his first visit to the country. ""Now that he had shown Innocent his country, Innocent was going to show him his,"" Jenkins said. Innocent, who was standing next to Henn at the time of the attack, survived the bombings, and tried to help Henn, who had been struck by shrapnel, Jenkins said. The nonprofit organization works with Ugandan children affected by decades of war between rebels and government forces. Rebels abduct the victims -- referred to as invisible children -- and force them to fight the government. Some younger girls are forced into sex slavery. Aid groups estimate tens of thousands of children have been abducted by one such group, the Lord's Resistance Army. ""These are some of our Ugandan students who fell in love with Nate's wit, strength, character and steadfast friendship,"" said a post on Invisible Children's website. ""They gave him the Acholi name 'Oteka,' which means 'The Strong One.'"" Invisible Children Co-Founder Jason Russell said Henn was in Uganda to visit his relatives and work with the organization. On Monday, two Invisible Children's founders headed to Uganda to assist in returning the remains to his parents in North Carolina. Henn, who lived in San Diego, California, joined Invisible Children through his sister's work with the organization. He was staying in Uganda with his aunt and uncle who are missionaries and planned to meet up with the Invisible Children program later in the week. The program has now been postponed. Brenda Kibler, Henn's longtime childhood friend and fellow church member, said she had e-mailed him after he arrived in Uganda last week, telling him she was thankful he was safe. The two took mission trips together in high school, including a visit to Peru. ""Nate was a very happy, friendly, outgoing person. He loved kids and he just loved people in general,"" said Kibler, who lives in Wilmington, Delaware. ""He was always one of the first people to sign up for community outreach like Habitat for Humanity, missions, whatever."" Henn raised money among friends and family to travel to Uganda for a month -- a lifelong dream. When they chatted last week, Henn told Kibler he wanted to continue working with charitable organizations. ""He was passionate for doing the work that the Lord did and helping people,"" Kibler said. ""I know for a fact he would be proud to know he died, living the life that he did. And that people are proud of him and know for a fact that he lived a selfless life."" Henn -- a native of Raleigh, North Carolina -- had worked with the nonprofit for a year and a half and raised money to help educate Ugandan students affected by war. Separately, Henn's brother was hospitalized Monday after being injured in a private plane crash at the airport in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, police and hospital officials said. Jenkins said the brother was aboard the plane of a family friend, en route to be with Henn's family. At the time of the bombings, Henn was with some of the students he worked with, the group said. Henn is the only confirmed American fatality -- five other Americans were wounded, according to U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley. The explosion killed at least 74 people, Ugandan officials said Monday. At least 85 people were injured, authorities said. The three explosions Sunday ripped through two venues, where crowds were watching the World Cup in the Ugandan capital of Kampala. The first one struck an Ethiopian restaurant in a neighborhood dotted with bars and popular among expatriates; two were at a rugby sports center. Henn was watching the game at the rugby center, the organization said. CNN's Sarah Baker contributed to this report.","Childhood friend says Nate Henn planned a life of service .

"Washington (CNN) -- A popular bicycle maker is recalling about 12,000 bicycles after receiving reports of the bike's front fork breaking and causing riders to suffer nasty falls. A bicycle fork is used to hold the front wheel and allows the rider to steer the bicycle. Specialized Bicycle Components, which sold the forks on at least 18 different bike models through retailers from 2007 until July, said riders should immediately stop riding the bikes. Four reports of riders suffering facial fractures and head and shoulder injuries and cuts led to the nationwide recall, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. The forks were manufactured in China by Kinesis and are primarily found on Specialized's Globe bike model, but riders should double-check their forks just to make sure. The CPSC reports 2008 and 2009 women's and men's Globe model bicycles may also be affected. Recalled models include the Globe Elite, Globe Sport, Globe Sport Disc, Globe Centrum Comp, Globe Centrum Elite, Globe City 6, Globe Vienna 3, Globe Vienna 3 Disc, Globe Vienna 4, Globe Vienna Deluxe 3, Globe Vienna Deluxe 4, Globe Vienna Deluxe 5 and Globe Vienna Deluxe 6 bicycles. The bicycles were sold in various colors, including gun, silver, black, khaki, navy, bone, blue, charcoal, burgundy and gold. The brand name ""Specialized"" is on the lower frame tube and the model name is on various locations on the bicycle frame. The company said riders can take the defective bicycles to any authorized Specialized retailer for no-cost installation of a free replacement fork.","Specialized Bicycle Components is recalling several of its Globe bike models .

"(CNN) -- In case you haven't noticed, this election season is awash in money. By the end of July, Mitt Romney had widened his cash advantage over President Obama by $62 million. Romney has also been raising more money than Obama in the last three months. If Romney continues to outraise Obama, does it mean that he will win the presidential race? Can money buy elections? Palin not present at RNC but still a presence . Historically, the candidate who raises the most money is likely to win. In recent presidential elections, the only victors whose campaign committees raised less than their opponent were Bill Clinton in 1996 (raising $116.8 million to Sen. Bob Dole's $134.7 million) and Ronald Reagan, who raised less than Jimmy Carter but nevertheless swept into Washington in a 1980 landslide. In both instances, the comparison of funds raised is limited to their primary campaigns as, unlike today, these candidates relied exclusively upon the presidential public financing system which provided funds in equal amounts to both major party candidates for their general election campaigns. Fortunately, for candidates in any given race, money alone provides no guarantee of victory. Candidates need exceptional campaign skills, a solid election team, charisma, name recognition and it helps to be an incumbent who usually has these attributes and whose viability often attracts more donations. Still, money is essential. For example, in the 2010 cycle (including both primaries and general elections), only 9 winning House challengers spent under $1 million. Candidates need a lot of resources to conduct a meaningful campaign and, these days, that costs $1.4 million for an average House seat and up to hundreds of millions to take the White House. Over the last decade, we've seen that in the vast majority of congressional races, those who raised the most money emerged victorious. In 2004, Senate candidates who raised the most money won 88% of the time and House candidates who raised the most money won an astonishing 97.8% of the time. It is a testament to money's influence that even in what was widely considered to be a ""wave election"" in 2010, when the political environment favored the GOP, candidates with the most money still held sway in most of the races. In 2012, money is even more important because candidates are not just competing with their electoral opponent anymore, but also with the messages and money from highly professionalized super PACs and nonprofits with lots of campaign experience. These unfamiliar groups' agendas may or may not be clear to candidates, or the voters they're trying to influence. Outside spending is now the hallmark of America's elections, particularly in tight races. Walmart moms not yet buying Romney or Obama . Expect to see record spending this year, which will largely come from very few donors. While the presidential campaigns are raising less money overall than in 2008, money spent by super PACs and secretive nonprofits, ostensibly independently, to influence elections is soaring. Groups across the political spectrum are making ""independent expenditures"" and ""issue ads"" that talk about candidates and issues without explicit ""vote for"" messages. This is the evolutionary effects of two critical changes in the campaign finance world. One is the demise of the presidential public funding program and the other is the formal legal sanctioning of unlimited and unrestricted spending directed at candidates. Since 1976, the presidential public financing system included matching funds for small contributions in primaries and equal grants for the two general election nominees. Beginning with George W. Bush rejecting public matching funds in the 2000 primary campaign (and the spending limits that went with them), that system was diminished incrementally until 2008 when Obama's rejection of general election funding spelled its final demise. The system was far from perfect, but it offered an equal base from which the two presidential candidates could conduct the eight or nine week sprint to the finish. And it would reduce the fundraising frenzy that now surrounds this presidential race. Witness how Paul Ryan began his tenure as Romney's running mate with a stop at the Venetian Hotel to meet Sheldon Adelson, the billionaire casino magnate who has previously said he will spend up to $100 million to ensure President Obama's defeat. Team Obama, meanwhile, is holding exclusive, coast-to-coast fundraisers in homes of the super-rich, giving face time (with the president, vice president, first lady and various other celebrities) to those who can bring $70,000 or so to the table. Similarly, a series of judicial and regulatory decisions in recent years has yielded a system in which unlimited funds from virtually any source can be brought directly into the campaign at any time, often with no indication of who is paying the bill. The maze of obscure organizations designed to coordinate these outside efforts and obfuscate their financial sources is just one more example of the cynical efforts of the political class to bend the rules and manipulate the process in hopes of gaining some small advantage on Election Day. It's an attitude that is not lost on an already frustrated electorate that finds little in the political process worthy of respect. The result is an atmosphere where candidates and parties must raise upwards of $20 million or more each week or risk falling behind. The airwaves are saturated in an unprecedented effort to influence voters in the dozen states up for grabs this year. In the largest of these states (Ohio, Florida, Virginia) the campaigns, super PACs and other shadowy groups have spent an average of nearly $30 million each month since May, levels not seen until late fall in the closest of previous presidential races. We've reached the point in the campaign where groups running issues ads that identify a candidate would normally have to disclose their donors. But in a cynical move, groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Crossroads GPS readily admit to employing evasive tactics which, ironically, require that they take a more aggressive position for or against the candidate, in exchange for which they may completely dodge disclosure of their donors. Meanwhile, we move toward fall pretending that our campaign finance system remains sound and will protect us when, in some key respects, the rules and disclosure that the Citizens United decision, and the entire system, depends on no longer exist. Partisan advantage appears to have replaced institutional dysfunction as the driving forces behind the eroding disclosure of those ""paying the piper"" in this election. The question is whether and when enough people will engage their representatives and collectively demand more authentic dialogue and intellectually honest leadership from lawmakers in Washington. If there is to be any hope of change, this is step No. 1. Otherwise, we shouldn't be surprised when, come 2013, we start hearing a new tune, but can't see who's calling it. Meanwhile, Romney, Obama, their parties and the outside groups that support them are all locked in an exhaustive race for funds. While Romney has done well compared to Obama in the last few months, the Obama campaign has raised far more overall this cycle. Both camps will have enough money to get their message out, but only one will win the election. In the end, money may not be the only reason, but if history is any indication, whichever candidate raises more of it will likely be our next president. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sheila Krumholz.","Recently, Mitt Romney widened his cash advantage over President Obama by $62 million .

"(CNN) -- NASA plans to capture an asteroid and start sending astronauts aloft again by 2017, even with a tighter budget, the U.S. space agency announced Wednesday. The Obama administration is asking Congress for just over $17.7 billion in 2014, down a little more than 1% from the nearly $17.9 billion currently devoted to space exploration, aeronautics and other science. The request includes $105 million to boost the study of asteroids, both to reduce the risk of one hitting Earth and to start planning for a mission to ""identify, capture, redirect, and sample"" a small one. The plan is to send an unmanned probe out to seize the asteroid and tow it into orbit around the moon, where astronauts would study it. ""This mission allows us to better develop our technology and systems to explore farther than we ever have before ... to places humanity has dreamed of for as long as I've been alive,"" NASA Administrator Charles Bolden told reporters. The Obama administration has said before that it wants to send astronauts to explore an asteroid by 2025 and to Mars by 2030. Forget falling stars: NASA plans to catch an asteroid . Wednesday's budget request would include another $20 billion to study near-Earth asteroids -- doubling the current spending on that effort. The funding is aimed not only at finding a suitable asteroid to explore, but also at ""protecting the planet,"" Bolden said. That concern got new attention after February, when a nearly 150-foot asteroid passed within 18,000 miles of Earth. That one was expected -- but the same day, an unrelated, 45-foot space rock plunged into the atmosphere and exploded high over southwestern Russia, injuring an estimated 1,200 people. White House science adviser John Holdren told a congressional committee in March that as few as 10% of asteroids more than 150 yards wide -- which he called ""potential city killers"" -- have been detected. NASA's budget request includes $822 million for the agency's Commercial Crew Program, its push to resume U.S. space flights through private companies by 2017. Bolden called that the ""bottom-line"" figure, warning that any cuts would mean delays. NASA has already hired the unmanned SpaceX Dragon to deliver cargo to the International Space Station, though no commercial manned missions are currently under way. While putting money into renewed human space flight efforts, the proposal cuts scientific research, particularly the study of the other planets in our solar system. Planetary science takes a nearly $300 million hit compared to 2012, the last year detailed figures were available. NASA officials defended the cut, saying major projects like the Mars rover Curiosity and the upcoming MAVEN probe to study the Martian upper atmosphere are already past their most expensive phases. ""But of course we'll be ramping up again as we approach 2020 and the next Mars rover,"" said Beth Robinson, the agency's chief financial officer. Bolden said NASA's Mars research is the biggest part of the planetary science budget. Read more space news on Light Years .","NEW: Asteroid research will help defend Earth, NASA chief says .

"(CNN) -- ""I know I didn't chow down on a spoon!"" declared John Manley, who recently discovered that an eating utensil was the source of his two years of ill health, coughing, vomiting and pain. The Wilmington, North Carolina, resident had surgery last week to remove part of a plastic spoon from his lung. And it wasn't just any old plastic spoon; it came from the fast-food chain Wendy's, with the restaurant logo clearly visible on the handle. ""It must have been in the food or drink,"" Manley told CNN affiliate WECT. His doctor found the spoon after looking into his lungs with an endoscope, a medical instrument with a long, thin tube containing a light and a video camera. ""He explained that there was an object down there, and it had writing on it,"" Manley said. ""It spelled out 'Wendy's' on one side and 'hamburgers' on the other, and I was a little floored.""

"(CNN) -- Tom wasn't accustomed to not knowing the right answer. A business executive in his 50s, he had been suffering from agonizing back pain for nearly two years, and all his doctors could tell him was that they couldn't find the cause or an appropriate treatment. So Tom did what most people wouldn't -- he started researching to find a doctor anywhere in the world who could help him. The problem, as it turned out, was that Tom's doctors were looking at his spine for the source of his pain, and that's not where it was coming from. He was suffering from sacroiliac joint dysfunction, the deterioration of the two joints on the side of the lower spine that connect it to the pelvis. Studies have found that 20 to 25% of all chronic lower back pain comes not from the spine but from the sacroliac, or SI, joint, which bears and transfers weight and movement from your upper body to your legs. When the ligaments wear out and the SI joint becomes unstable, it can generate a similar kind of sharp back pain -- or sciatica-like pain down your leg -- as a ruptured disc. Most spine surgeons, however, aren't trained to look at the sacroiliac joint; they generally don't learn about it during their residency or fellowships. And it doesn't occur to most patients to ask. Then X-rays, MRIs and CT scans of aching, aging backs show narrowing spinal discs, without actually showing whether these discs are producing pain ... further confusing the diagnosis of the suffering patient. As a result, many people progress through the usual stages of back pain treatment, from physical therapy and chiropractic treatment to injections, laser procedures and finally to surgery, without ever addressing the true source of the pain. One study found that among ""failed"" spinal fusion patients -- people who had their lumbar vertebrae fused and were still in pain afterward -- the SI joint was the real culprit in more than half the cases. When you know to look at the SI joint, finding out whether it's the source of the pain is usually pretty easy. If an injection of the local anesthetic Lidocaine into the joint produces temporary pain relief, then that's likely where the problem resides. If so, all the treatments previously misdirected at the spine -- chiropractic, physical therapy and medication -- can be aimed at the proper target. If those treatments don't work, the next step is often surgery. Up until recently, that meant a major open fusion procedure, followed by several months of recovery. However, a new, minimally invasive procedure is now available that uses small titanium implants to stabilize the joint. The tiny incisions mean patients recover much more quickly. The procedure is being done regularly here at UCLA and at other top spine centers around the country. It worked for Tom -- he's living pain-free and is back in control of his life. And there are millions more Toms out there living with chronic back pain who could benefit from knowing more about where that pain may be really coming from and how it can be dealt with effectively. If you are suffering from lower back pain, make sure to ask your doctor to examine your SI joint in addition to the routine examination. You may want to seek out a spine surgeon who has experience with sacroiliitis -- the Internet is a good place to start but referrals are also valuable. Ask the surgeon directly if he/she has experience operating on patients with SI dysfunction in the past year. And don't accept a lumbar fusion surgery performed for back pain alone (versus leg pain) without having your SI joint checked out by an expert. The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of Dr. Nick Shamie.","Studies show 20 to 25% of all chronic lower back pain comes from the sacroliac joint .

"(CNN) -- Will the Super Bowl ""Dare to Be Stupid""? If an Internet petition has its way, yes. ""Weird Al"" Yankovic, the king of the song parody, has been nominated to perform at the next Super Bowl halftime show on a Change.org petition -- and close to 60,000 people have signed on their approval as of Thursday morning. Ed Ball, who created the petition, told The Hollywood Reporter that he was inspired by a suggestion that Justin Bieber headline the extravaganza, which has featured such names as U2, the Rolling Stones, Prince and Beyonce (and, to be fair, Elvis impersonators and Up With People). ""I thought, 'Man, this is so crappy,' "" he told the publication. The time is certainly right for Yankovic, who is riding perhaps the biggest wave of his career. His new album, ""Mandatory Fun,"" debuted at No. 1, and the series of eight videos he made to promote it -- including parodies of ""Royals"" (""Foil""), ""Blurred Lines"" (""Word Crimes"") and ""Happy"" (""Tacky"") -- quickly became some of the most-viewed on YouTube. ""Weird Al's"" best song ever? In the petition, Ball observes that some of the artists parodied could join Yankovic on stage, and the result would be most entertaining. ""The theatrics alone would be hilarious and a welcoming change, and draw a wider audience of fans that typically would not tune into the championship game or half-time show,"" he writes. Next year's Super Bowl -- that would be Super Bowl XLIX, for the Roman numeral-inclined -- will be held February 1 in Glendale, Arizona. Ball told The Hollywood Reporter that Yankovic would be by far the best choice the NFL could make.

"(CNN) -- In a tucked-away corner of Zanzibar's historic Stone Town lies a little shop of curiosities. Colorful bags, necklaces and hats hang on the racks, and beautiful African prints line the walls. In the back room, a low hum of sewing machines is a sign of busy artisans at work.

Today, his most popular items are small wallets, pouches and cosmetics cases made out of vibrant African prints known as Kitenge. However, beginnings were tough, and Janmohamed found it difficult to market his products: ""When I started the business a few years back, you can say it was a nightmare. It was really a challenge.

At the moment, his shop is breaking even, but the businessman hopes to start making a profit within two years, and says his shop is frequented not just by tourists but local people as well. Janmohamed attributes his success to Zanzibar's unique handicrafts, which display a fusion of Swahili and Arabian culture, but stresses that creating a welcoming environment is just as important. ""It's not just about selling your product. It's about maintaining your service, it's about how you talk to your customer and maintain that relationship as well,"" he says.

"New York (CNN) -- President Barack Obama's policy toward Syria -- three years of red lines and calls for regime change -- culminated Monday in a barrage of airstrikes on terror targets there, marking a turning point for the conflict and thrusting the President further into it. The U.S. said Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain and Jordan had joined in the attack on ISIS targets near Raqqa in Syria. The U.S. also launched airstrikes against another terrorist organization, the Khorasan Group. Obama described its members as ""seasoned al Qaeda operatives in Syria,"" and U.S. officials said the group was plotting attacks against the United States and other Western targets. Initially hesitant to become involved in the Syrian conflict, which pits an authoritarian regime led by President Bashar al-Assad against a patchwork of rebel groups, Obama has moved from sending weapons to opposition fighters last year, to backing away from airstrikes against al-Assad, to ordering Monday¹s campaign to take out ISIS terrorists who have used the Syrian unrest to gain a foothold. Airstrikes: What you need to know . It¹s new ground for the U.S., which lacks robust intelligence capabilities in Syria and hasn't sent any ground forces there. Unlike the campaign against ISIS in Iraq, the U.S. doesn¹t have al-Assad¹s permission to launch airstrikes in Syria, though the U.S. notified him before the attacks began. The coalition strikes began the evening before Obama made his annual visit to the United Nations General Assembly, where the White House hopes to secure broader support for the anti-ISIS campaign from a range of allies. The main focus, officials say, is on stemming the flow of foreign-born fighters who have joined up with ISIS and other terror groups in Syria and Iraq. The U.S. intelligence community believes there are 15,000 foreign fighters from 80 countries who are fighting alongside ISIS and other similar terror groups -- 2,000 from Europe and roughly 100 from the United States. A senior administration official said on Monday that some of those Americans had already returned to the United States and were being tracked by the FBI. Not all of those who have returned were fighting for ISIS. Most positive reaction to Syria airstrikes comes from Obama's critics . Administration officials are confident in the prospects of a U.S.-backed resolution that would compel nations to try to stop citizens from leaving to fight for terror groups. Obama will personally chair a session of the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday to push for the measure. He last chaired the panel in 2009, and was the first American president to do so. Here is a timeline of the major events leading up to U.S. action in Syria: . • August 2012: President Obama lays out a ""red line"" in the Syrian conflict, saying that the use of chemical weapons would ""change his calculus"" on Syria. • March, April, June 2013: The Syrian government uses chemical weapons against opposition forces in Syria. • August 2013: The al-Assad regime continues to use chemical weapons and Obama lays out a plan for limited military intervention against the Syrian regime while asking Congress to weigh in. • September 2013: Congress is reticent to endorse U.S. military action in Syria. But then, in a plan engineered by Russia, al-Assad agrees to give up Syria's chemical weapons and Obama begins to back away from military strikes. • June 2014: Obama sends more than 300 military advisers to Iraq to advise Iraqi forces and protect U.S. interests. • July 2014: Obama sends more advisers to Iraq. • August 7, 2014: Obama authorizes targeted airstrikes in Iraq to guard American interests and protect minorities facing impending massacre by ISIS militants. • August 20, 2014: American journalist James Foley is beheaded by ISIS. The video is posted online. Within the next few weeks, ISIS beheads another American journalist, Steven Sotloff, and a British aid worker, David Haines, and posts those videos online as well. • September 10, 2014: Obama announces he's authorized the U.S. military to strike ISIS in Iraq and Syria. In addition, he announces a plan to arm and train 5,000 moderate Syrian rebels, pending congressional approval. • September 18, 2014: Congress approves the President's plan to arm and train Syrian rebels. • September 22, 2014: The U.S. launches its first airstrikes in Syria in coordination with five Arab nations.

"(CNN) -- A good soldier never publicly contradicts the commander in chief, at least not intentionally, and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel is a good soldier. A Vietnam War veteran, Hagel provided a robust defense of President Barack Obama's approach to ISIS jihadists in Iraq and Syria when interviewed Wednesday by CNN National Security Correspondent Jim Sciutto. With Obama facing criticism over what even a fellow Democrat called too much caution, Hagel sought to make clear that the President wants to eliminate any ISIS threat to the United States and its interests -- both abroad and at home. 'Degrade and destroy' ""We're providing the President with those options to degrade and destroy"" the ability of the group that calls itself the Islamic State to attack Americans anywhere in the world, he said. When Sciutto pressed for clarity on Obama's statement earlier Wednesday , asking if the President meant containment, Hagel sough to clarify what his boss said. Asked whether Obama meant ""containment"" when he said earlier Wednesday that the goal was to manage the ISIS threat, Hagel said, ""No, it's not contain."" ""It's exactly what the President said: Degrade and destroy."" Why it took Obama so long to address his no ISIS strategy comments . And so it went for an hour of questions from Sciutto and some in the audience at the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island. Hagel repeatedly expressed agreement with Obama's positions on Syria and Ukraine, where the international community has said Russian troops have crossed the border to help pro-Russian separatists fighting the Ukrainian military. Asked if Obama tipped his hand by rejecting a U.S. ground invasion against ISIS three years after bringing home combat forces from Iraq, Hagel said, ""We're not going to go back into Iraq the same way we came out of Iraq a few years ago."" Biden's warning to ISIS: 'We will follow them to the gates of hell' Instead, he advocated Obama's broad-based strategy that calls for a new and more inclusive Iraqi government, an international coalition supporting it and limited U.S. military action like the airstrikes launched last month at ISIS targets in the north. ""There's no question in my mind"" that the Obama administration approached the ISIS issue with a ""sense of urgency,"" Hagel said, adding that possible airstrikes on the jihadists' positions in Syria were among the options the Pentagon has presented to the President for further steps. What can the U.S. do against ISIS in Syria -- and could it work? On the Ukraine conflict, Hagel sounded a similar theme. If Russian President Vladimir Putin continued to escalate the fighting there, he would face further consequences on top of U.S. and European Union sanctions imposed so far, but ""we're not going to get into a military engagement, a war, over this with Russia,"" Hagel said. 'Sick to your stomach' The ISIS issue dominated the hour-long interview. Hagel said the videotaped beheadings of two American journalists by the Sunni jihadists ""makes you sick to your stomach, but it again reminds you of the brutality and barbarism that is afoot in some places in the world."" ""It won't just recede into the gray recesses of history until we stop it,"" he said. At one point, Hagel misspoke about the number of Americans believed fighting with ISIS. ""As we have acknowledged publicly, we are aware of over 100 U.S. citizens who have U.S. passports who are fighting in the Middle East with ISIL forces,"" he said, referring to the group by another acronym for the Sunni jihadists used by some U.S. officials. ""There may be more -- we don't know."" The Pentagon later told Sciutto that Hagel's figure referred to the total number of Americans believed fighting in Syria with various groups, not just ISIS. About a dozen Americans are thought to be with ISIS. When Americans leave for jihad .

"(CNN) -- Roughly 700 students at the University of California, Santa Barbara, will be given a powerful antibiotic to guard against meningitis after coming in contact with four people diagnosed with meningococcal disease, county health officials said Tuesday. The news came as the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department confirmed a fourth student at the university has been diagnosed with meningococcal disease. The four students all became sick with meningococcal disease, which can cause meningitis or blood infections, during a three-week period in November. One of them has become permanently disabled, the Santa Barbara Public Health Department said. The second and third students who fell ill recovered and are back in classes, UCSB spokesman George Foulsham said. The fourth is expected to recover, he said, but the first is still hospitalized. The first three cases were confirmed to be caused by type B bacteria, which is the same bacteria strain causing an outbreak of meningitis at Princeton University. Testing is not complete on the most recent case, county health spokeswoman Susan Klein-Rothschild said in an e-mail. Meningitis is a form of meningococcal disease, but not all four cases at UCSB are meningitis, Klein-Rothschild said. Although the Centers for Disease Control recommends that college freshmen living in dorms receive a meningitis vaccine, the vaccine approved for use in the United States does not protect against the kind caused by type B bacteria. UCSB is sending a letter to its fraternities and sororities, most of which are based off campus, asking them to refrain from large social gatherings where cups might be exchanged, Foulsham said. ""We're almost certain that they'll go along with that as we head into the holiday period here,"" he said. More than 500 students at UCSB who were identified as close contacts of these students have received preventive antibiotics, county health officials said. This week, additional individuals who may have been exposed to the bacteria causing the meningococcal disease are being directed to take antibiotics. The school has been consulting with the county health department and the CDC about the outbreak, Foulsham said. On the opposite U.S. coast, Princeton announced last week that it would make an unlicensed vaccine for meningitis B available to undergraduate students, as well as graduate students living in dorms or the Graduate College and annexes, and other university community members with particular medical conditions. The vaccine, Bexsero, made by Novartis, is approved in Australia and Europe but not the United States. The CDC's Institutional Review Board approved the importation of Bexsero specifically for the Princeton situation. ""The CDC is the lead on the vaccine issue,"" Klein-Rothschild said Tuesday. What is meningitis B? Meningitis is caused by inflammation of the membranes that cover the brain and the spinal cord, known as the meninges. Infection of the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord usually causes this inflammation, according to the CDC. Meningitis usually develops in response to bacteria or viruses, but there can be other forms and causes, such as physical injury, cancer or certain drugs, according to the CDC. The bacterial form is rare in the United States, and the group B bacterial strains are even more rare. Meningitis can spread via the exchange of saliva and other respiratory secretions through kissing, coughing, sharing drinks and living in close quarters, such as in dormitories, according to health officials. Symptoms can include a stiff neck, headache, fever, vomiting, rashes, sensitivity to light and confusion. Untreated, the disease can lead to complications such as hearing impairment, brain damage, limb amputations and death. Antibiotic treatment of the most common types of bacterial meningitis ""should reduce the risk of dying from meningitis to below 15%, although the risk remains higher among young infants and the elderly,"" according to the CDC. In 2012, there were 480 cases of bacterial meningitis in the United States, according to the CDC. Of those, 160 were group B.

"(CNN) -- A recent pair of racially charged political incidents in the South illustrate the pitfalls -- and potential benefits -- that await the national Republican Party leadership if it makes good on an oft-repeated pledge to woo black voters away from the Democratic Party. In Florida, Republican candidate for Congress Glo Smith recently made national news when unknown vandals destroyed one of her campaign signs by spray-painting her face white -- a reference to the ugly, warped idea that black candidates who run on the GOP line are outcasts from the black community who are ""acting white."" In Mississippi, the bitter endgame of the recent Republican runoff between incumbent Sen. Thad Cochran and tea party challenger Chris McDaniel included a telephone press conference held by Cochran's aides that was interrupted by an anonymous caller insistently asking: ""If black people were harvesting cotton, why is it OK to harvest their votes?"" It was a sign of the rage expressed by McDaniel that Cochran's razor-close 1.6% win was made possible by an unusual last-minute appeal to Democratic black voters, who crossed party lines to supply the margin of victory. Cochran's victory is expected to hold up despite a long-shot legal challenge by McDaniel. And Smith is soldiering on toward her August 26 primary, after which she faces an uphill battle against longtime incumbent Rep. Corrine Brown (Disclosure: Smith's family and mine have been close for years). The rough and tumble of Southern primary politics is nothing new, but the candidates shouldn't have to weather these recent attacks on their own. Now would be a perfect time for national party brass and congressional leaders to prove they believe their own rhetoric about GOP outreach to black voters. A committed, earnest effort would be good for the party, for black communities and for the nation. At present, Republicans are on a collision course with diversity that will, without a course correction, spell long-term disaster for the party. In 2012, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney got only 17% of nonwhite voters, and polls show only 2% of Republicans are black and 6% are Latino. Republicans can't allow those trends to continue in a nation where the nonwhite population is currently 35% and expected to reach 57% by 2060. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus has taken steps to broaden the party's base: After the Romney loss, he committed $10 million in party funds to hire organizers tasked with building support in black, Latino and Asian communities. That's a good start. Even better would be to funnel support -- money, ""ground troops,"" advertising support and high-profile endorsements -- to candidates like Glo Smith when they are in the thick of battle. Even in an uphill battle like the challenge in Florida's 5th District, the party must support black candidates who step forward and endure abuse for running as Republicans. Opinion: What GOP can learn from Cochran's use of blacks to win . Smith's not alone. This year, the fact that 11 black Republicans are running for office -- a record high number -- should be a major point of pride for the national party, and a high priority for when directing resources. Ditto for the fact that Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina is an odds-on favorite to make history this year: If elected to a full term in November, Scott -- who was appointed in 2012 to finish out retiring Jim DeMint's term -- will become the state's first elected black Republican senator. Black voters have been solidly Democratic voters since the 1960s, but some black voters gravitate toward Republicans positions on bread-and-butter issues like support for charter schools and pro-growth economic policies. And many black church-goers find the GOP a comfortable political home for their culturally conservative views on school prayer, abortion and same-sex marriage. If Republicans are smart, they'll continue to build on those points of agreement. Even smarter would be to seize the opportunity presented by Cochran's gambit in Mississippi. Having relied on black voters to rescue his candidacy, Cochran is now expected to return the favor by fighting against restrictive voter ID laws and by steering federal financial support to black colleges and universities. Both measures make sense in the state that is the poorest in the nation and has the largest percentage of blacks. If Cochran holds up his end of the deal, Republicans might have a road map for ways to broaden their appeal as the 2016 presidential election approaches. In this climate of political polarization, the key to the political center lies with candidates and political parties with the nerve and creativity to form broad coalitions that cross traditional boundaries. Southern black voters and candidates are showing they are ready to make that kind of deal. Here's hoping party leaders take them up on the offer.","If Republicans don't get more minority support, it will spell future disaster .
GOP must support black candidates who endure abuse for being Republican .
GOP must keep promises to nonwhites: They are 35% of the population .
GOP should form broad coalitions that cross traditional boundaries ."
"(CNN) -- A potentially deadly disease that can maim the brain has befallen two prestigious American institutions that educate the mind. With federal health authorities' permission, Princeton University is distributing a drug not approved in the United States to fight a campus outbreak of a rare strain of meningitis. As of Thursday, 5,268 people had received the vaccine at the Ivy League school, representing 91% of those who were eligible to receive it. Princeton has about 5,000 undergraduate students. California health officials are considering following suit. If they and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention approve, the same vaccine could be offered at University of California, Santa Barbara, where four students came down with meningococcal disease type B, the same strain that caused the Princeton outbreak. An assessment is ongoing about the effectiveness and potential risks of the vaccine, Santa Barbara County Public Health Department spokeswoman Susan Klein-Rothschild said in an e-mail Friday. Part of that effort will determine which UCSB students would be considered high-risk and would be the best target for the vaccine, she said. Meningitis is an infection of the protective tissue called the meninges that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. Meningococcal disease can cause meningitis or other illnesses such as bloodstream infections. All four of the students infected at UCSB got meningococcal disease, although not all four cases are meningitis. Two students have recovered, and another is expected to soon, but the fourth has suffered serious complications. Other germs like fungus and viruses can also lead to meningitis, but they are milder or harder to catch. The bacterial type is contagious and very dangerous. ""It's the bacterial meningitis branch that packs the most powerful punch. Its bacterial swarm can cause brain damage, hearing loss, or learning disabilities,"" according to the CDC. There is no FDA-approved vaccine to fight the type B bacterial strain, so one had to be imported for Princeton. The CDC is communicating with local and state officials about the UCSB situation and is the ""lead on the vaccine issue,"" Klein-Rothschild said. It starts with a 'cold' Meningococcal disease starts out like a bad chest cold, but it can spread via phlegm to the meninges. Patients with the condition can fully recover, but UCSB student Aaron Loy has not been so fortunate. If things go bad, meningococcal disease can bring on a stiff neck, headaches, fever, delirium and vomiting, and can result in permanent neurological damage. The disease can also get into the bloodstream and attack extremities, and can result in death. Doctors may have to amputate a limb while fighting the disease, the CDC said. They had to remove Loy's lower legs. Loy had been doing well in school, developing strong friendships and competing for a starting position on the lacrosse team, said his father, Mike Loy. ""It's absolutely devastating to have Aaron, in the prime of his life, be stricken"" with the disease, Mike Loy said. ""We hope that Aaron's horrific illness brings increased awareness and rapid approval by the FDA of the vaccine"" for the type B strain. Aaron Loy is also an avid soccer player. The charity HelpHOPELive is taking donations to help him meet medical expenses, including prosthetic legs and physical therapy. Target: young, healthy groups . The viral and fungal types attack mostly infants and the elderly, but the bacteria like young, healthy adults who live in close quarters -- places where they sneeze and cough on each other, forget to wash their belongings and hands, or share a glass or a kiss, the CDC said. Students in dorm rooms make perfect targets. UCSB spokesman George Foulsham said on December 3 that the school is sending a letter to its fraternities and sororities, most of which are based off campus, asking them to refrain from large social gatherings where cups might be exchanged. ""We're almost certain that they'll go along with that as we head into the holiday period here,"" he said. Luckily, bacterial meningitis is not commonplace. There were only 480 cases of it last year in the United States. The chances of dying go down to 15% if someone who is infected takes vaccines and antibiotics, the CDC said. The vaccine . The CDC recommends that college freshmen living in dorms receive a meningitis vaccine, but the vaccine approved for use in the United States does not protect against the kind caused by type B bacteria. Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis makes an inoculation called Bexsero, which is approved in Europe and Australia but is pending FDA approval. More than 1,000 students at UCSB have received preventive antibiotics as of December 9, but those at Princeton are already getting the vaccine. The university is offering the shot to about 5,800 people -- mainly students in dorms and similar living quarters, but also some others in the community with certain medical conditions. Health officials are not making any additional exceptions for the use of the Swiss vaccine in the United States. Anything that weakens resistance to disease -- such as age, diabetes, an AIDS infection or drugs that suppress the immune system -- make people more susceptible to meningococcal disease, the Mayo Clinic said. That includes excessive use of alcohol, another reason to put off campus bashes until the bacterial scourge is eliminated. CNN's Chuck Johnston and Paul Vercammen contributed to this report.","Bacterial meningitis can cause brain damage, deafness and lead to amputations .

"(CNN) -- Three people died and 79 others were injured, four seriously, in a suspected terror attack Wednesday in China's restive northwestern region. The incident spurred the nation's President Xi Jinping -- who was completing a four-day tour to the area -- to vow action against separatist attacks, state news reported. An explosion rocked the South Railway Station of Urumqi, capital of China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, followed by a knife attack at the same location. Xinhua announced the casualty toll via Twitter early Thursday, as well as Xi's urging ""decisive actions"" in response. ""The battle to combat violence and terrorism will not allow even a moment of slackness, and decisive actions must be taken to resolutely suppress the terrorists' rampant momentum,"" state-owned media reported Xi as saying. Xinhua, quoting police, also said ""knife-wielding mobs"" attacked people at one of the station's exits following the blast, which occurred around 7 p.m. Wednesday. Police evacuated people from the square in front of the station, deployed armed officers and cordoned off entrances to the station, where train services had been suspended. The station reopened about two hours later. with passengers re-entering under a heavily-armed police presence. Frequent outbreaks of violence have beset Xinjiang, a resource-rich region where the arrival of waves of Han Chinese people over the decades has fueled sectarian tensions with the Uyghurs, a Turkic-speaking, predominantly Muslim ethnic group. China was shocked in March as a violent terror attack in another train station, in Kunming, saw 10 men armed with long knives kill 29 commuters. The fight against separatist violence in the autonomous region was a focus of the Chinese leader's visit. During his tour, Xi visited security forces and watched an anti-terror drill, Hong Kong's South China Morning Post reported. ""The battle to combat violence and terrorism will not allow even a moment of slackness, and decisive actions must be taken to resolutely suppress the terrorists' rampant momentum,"" Xinhua quoted Xi as saying during his tour. He also stressed the importance of ""long-term stability"" in the region as ""vital to the whole country's reform, development and stability; to the country's unity, ethnic harmony and national security as well as to the great revival of Chinese nation."" Speaking to local officials, the President called for national unity and opposition to separatism. He said China will use a ""strike-first"" strategy against militants in the region and forge policies to promote ethnic harmony.

"(CNN) -- Human beings can experience 34,000 different emotional states. But our research shows that in an average working week, most CEOs experience just one dozen emotions across work and home life. Those twelve emotions are mostly negative: Being overwhelmed, frustrated, angry, disappointed, and fearful. When I quizzed 200 western CEOs on the personal pressure they felt in their jobs, a typical response was: ""I can't talk to the chairman because in the end he's the one who is going to fire me. I can't talk to my finance director because ultimately I'm going to fire him, and I can't tell my wife because I never see her and when I do, that's the last thing she'll want to talk about."" About half confided they find the job intensely lonely and don't know who to turn to for advice. Indeed, Antonio Horta-Osorio's leave of absence from Lloyds Banking Group this month illustrates how the stress of the CEO role can leave individuals ill. Why is it so difficult at CEO level? The day to day pressures of the job are intense. Most CEOs are at the mercy of their diaries, their businesses, the press and their shareholders. With the western economies entering a long, hard winter, and the rising competitiveness of eastern businesses, CEOs in western countries face some of the harshest conditions of their careers. The long term personal toll can also be huge. One typical FTSE100 CEO told me: ""I have been married twice and have four kids and one grandchild. I can't remember the first two boys growing up when I was with my first wife. We separated when they were eight and nine. I can't remember them when they were young."" Most CEOs respond to this pressure -- and frequent self doubt -- by creating command and control systems. They take all crucial decisions, which are then meant to be executed lower down. The model depends on the CEO being an expert with good answers, typically based on their training as a finance director or deep commercial experience in their market. But the reality is almost all problems are channelled up to the top. So the CEO faces a huge burden. Is life different for CEOs in the east compared to the west? I interviewed a hundred leading Chinese entrepreneurs for my next book, and found the CEOs are constantly near exhaustion. In contrast to western CEOs they are tired not by a hard economic reality but because they have huge dreams. Typically, they have not yet worked out how to manage the hyper-growth their dream and the booming market are creating. This can cause problems because businesses need the driving energy, strategic clarity, commercial grip and inspiration that a great CEO can provide if they are to deliver their full potential for their owners, staff, customers and society. Tired professional managers and exhausted dreamers will not get the best from their businesses. In the current hard economic winter in the west and booming spring of China, inspiration and trust from the top will be vital ingredients in getting the best returns from businesses. How can CEOs learn from different cultures? Being a CEO is a huge and complicated job, and each business needs a bespoke approach. But CEOs can make a start with five steps: . 1. Clarify your dream. Western CEOs should learn from the Chinese. What do you truly dream of building? Rediscover the excitement and thrill that drove you to the top in the first place. 2. Build a fellowship. Most CEOs take too much direct personal control. It stifles those around you and it exhausts you. Learn to build a fellowship you trust and who will deliver for you every time. 3. Rekindle the spirit of your business. Narayana Murthy, founder and chairman Emeritus of Infosys, arguably the most globally successful Indian business of the last 25 years, told me: ""To me, leadership is primarily about raising the aspirations of people, making people say that they will walk on water."" Use your dream to inspire your teams and businesses. Share it with business partners to help you build trust. 4. Build a personal support system to ground you. Make rules to safeguard your recharge time, reconnect with your partners and kids and stay healthy. 5. Get out of the day to day. The best CEOs work on business as usual by exception, not as the norm. They maintain a tight grip of their business with robust systems and review but do not lurch from day crisis to day crisis. Ultimately, CEOs who are suffering need to find a new way of leading. In this high octane world, they can either work in a new way or burn out.","Research shows CEOs experience a dozen mostly negative emotions during an average week .

"(CNN) -- In business, it might pay to keep the customer happy, but how far should you go just to keep the peace? Thanks to new technology, a bad review now cuts both ways and the peer review is increasingly a feature of everything from holidays and restaurants to cab rides and flat shares. For Bereket Hagos, who drives an Uber car in central London, the two-way street of peer reviews has democratized a process that was normally arbitrated by employers. ""You just deal directly with the customer and that means there's real respect,"" he told CNN. Uber runs a five-star rating system for both drivers and customers, which Hagos says has a tendency to keep the reviews honest. ""My rating is 4.66 out of 5, which is good -- for me that's absolutely beautiful!"" he says. ""You can't expect 5 all the time because, of course, you meet a lot of people."" Reviews, too, have a subjective basis and Hagos says a driver or a passenger's reputation can be damaged unfairly. A difficult customer, he says, isn't necessarily difficult all the time. ""I personally will pick up passengers with a low rating because I simply don't like to ignore people,"" he said. ""When I've picked them up, I've found them to be perfectly nice."" Online customer reviews are now big business and, according to Margaret Ady of TrustYou, a company that tracks and aggregates reviews in the hospitality industry, online opinion is now the No.1 factor in influencing consumer choices. ""It has a huge impact. It's become the most trustworthy source of information for most travelers and peer reviews are really driving bookings,"" Ady told CNN. ""We've found that 65 per cent of travelers won't even book a hotel if it hasn't had a review written about it."" Peer reviews have now changed the marketing landscape for hotels, restaurants and holiday destinations. ""In many cases, they're beginning to make the old star rating for hotels obsolete,"" she said. ""There are still different expectations for different price categories but it's easier to look at reviews and see what people are saying and to make your booking decision based on that. ""It gives it more texture and for many people it's just more trustworthy."" TrustYou works by collating thousands of reviews from more than 250 websites around the world, aggregates them and then runs them through a semantic algorithm to get an overview of the hotel, restaurant or destination. Any outlying opinions -- either wildly positive or extremely negative -- are ironed out in the aggregate results produced by the company. ""What we're getting is exactly what the crowd is saying about a place,"" Ady said. Responding to negative feedback is always a delicate operation for vendors and service providers and TrustYou says the professional reputation of a client often hinges on how it responds to a flame from a customer. ""We give them guidelines, saying acknowledge if there was a problem, explain the steps you are taking to fix it and invite the guest back and explain that their stay next time will be much more comfortable,"" Ady said. ""We encourage clients to get in touch with the complainant directly to see if anything needs to be discussed. ""That tends to work pretty well. Although I have seen in the news some hotels that have not done a good job of this, luckily none of them were clients."" Online reviews are also becoming a powerful marketing tool for companies, with a spread of opinions not only showing up the strengths and weaknesses of a given service provider but also those of its rivals. TrustYou provides its clients with a monitoring tool that allows it to see what is being said about its business across all platforms and a dashboard that enables it to respond to every review being written. ""Then they can see our semantic analysis, so they can see areas where they are doing well and should be marketing along with areas that aren't doing so well and they need to improve,"" Ady said. ""They can also see their competitors too to see how they stack up or even get comparisons between hotels within their own chain."" While hotels and restaurants have been paying attention to online reviews for the past five or more years, Ady says it's only relatively recently that companies are starting to see them as a valuable marketing tool.

"London (CNN) -- It could be the find of the century, or something much more suspicious. ""La Bella Principessa"" -- a 13 inch tall pen-and-ink portrait of a Florentine woman with a Mona Lisa-esque smile -- sat in a drawer for decades, before being ""rediscovered"" and attributed as a lost $150 million masterpiece by Leonardo da Vinci. Each year, we're seeing ""priceless"" lost art reappearing -- a lost Van Gogh, a haul of Caravaggios, a stash of Picassos and Matisses -- that transform owners into multi-millionaires overnight. Today's booming international art market creates a near-irresistible draw for attic-raiders and flea market-shoppers hoping to win big -- and seductive target for fraudsters and forgers, too. Currently, the U.S. Department of Justice lists art crime as the world's third-highest-grossing criminal trade -- only behind drugs and arms dealing. Here, a lecturer teaching a new class in forgery-catching and the head of science at the British National Gallery's laboratory explain how new techniques identify ever more cunning forgers and bring true masterpieces to light. 1. Does it have style? Before a painting ever finds itself in front of the high tech gadgets now boasted by arts scientists, it is likely to face the oldest examination: an examination by a ""connoisseur"" -- one of a band of art experts whose weighty support can push a painting into contention as a potential masterpiece. Martin Kemp, a world-leading da Vinci scholar, conducted a year-long critical ""interrogation"" of the Principessa -- the brushstrokes, composition, and details of the clothes were all scrutinized -- to discover if the portrait bore the hallmarks of the master, or a lesser artist. ""Kemp specifically compiled evidence of all the mistakes that Leonardo's forgers had made through the ages,"" says Dr Christa Roodt, a Lecturer in Art Law and Business at Glasgow University, teaching a new course on Forgeries, Attributions and the Art Market. ""He would look for things like a right-handed brush stroke [da Vinci was left-handed], which could happen inadvertently, and would give the forger away, or a failure to layer the paint in the way Leonardo did it."" 2. Go beneath the surface . Kemp found no mistakes. Increasingly, scientists are developing techniques that allow the critical gaze of connoisseurs to penetrate further -- to ""give a new glance to art historians"" says Jean Penicaut, CEO of LumiÃ¨re Technology, a Paris-based firm which worked with Kemp to uncover the Principessa's secrets. For decades, forensics have employed x-ray and infra-red imaging to see through the surface paint to details hidden below -- often tantalising secrets later painted over. The National Gallery, London, acquired ""The Madonna of the Pinks"" in 2004 for Â£22m, identifying the portrait as an authentic Rafael. Back in their high-tech lab, head of science Marika Spring explains how infrared imaging found tentative sketching underneath -- typical of the artist plotting ideas for the painting, but unlikely to be seen in a student or forger copying an original. Lumiere's ""multispectral"" 300 megapixel cameras takes this further -- producing a digital scan that cuts through the paint and provide a thinly sliced view of the inside of the painting from surface down to canvas, revealing times a forger slipped up. Finding none, beliefs mounted that the Principessa could be the real deal. 3. Test the materials . A renaissance fake painted with modern synthetic pigments would be exposed at once. A quick look through a microscope is enough to tell the difference between these 19th century inventions and pigments used in the 15th and 16th centuries. But it doesn't stop there. Spring zooms in on a microscopic fleck of paint to show layer-upon-layer of paint and primer which the painter had laid down. An angular particle at the base, she explains, is ""colorless powdered glass."" The team had discovered this base layer on other Rafael paintings in the collection, but before this, Springs says: ""There's no way that a copyist several centuries later would have known that this is how Rafael prepared his paints."" For the Principessa, too, pigment analysis turned up only substances available during da Vinci's life. Radiocarbon dating -- a process more commonly used to date prehistoric archaeological finds -- indicated that the parchment was produced between 1440 and 1650. ""Both of those tests,"" says Roodt, ""indicated that it could well be by Leonardo."" 4. Beating the forgers . Either of those tests might once have ruled out modern day forgery -- but forgers are keeping up with scientific advances. ""Techniques are improving all the time, and the techniques can be used for good or evil,"" laughs Roodt. ""What if the breakthrough scientifically also helps the forger to make a more perfect forgery? So it is a race... it is a race of wits and technique and skill."" The National Gallery has confirmed the authenticity of the Rafael beyond any doubt and it hangs in the halls of the gallery, but testing on the da Vinci continues. Processes more commonly seen at a murder scene are now used in the attempt to piece together final evidence. Roodt mentions Peter Paul Biro, a Canadian forensic art expert, who attempted to find da Vinci's fingerprints in the Principessa's paint. The controversy seemed settled when Biro found a print under layers of paint which matched one from a known da Vinci, but Biro's techniques are now under the microscope, after an investigation by the New Yorker suggested he had used them to authenticate other fakes. For now, the Principessa remains in limbo. More from Ones to Watch: . Meet the 'chameleon' who blends into other people's family portraits .

"(CNN) -- The first frantic call comes from the school secretary inside the main building. ""Sandy Hook school,"" she says. ""I think there's somebody shooting in here. In Sandy Hook school."" ""OK, what makes you think that?"" the dispatcher asks. ""Because somebody has a gun. I saw a glimpse of somebody running down the hallway."" ""OK ..."" ""They're still running, they're still shooting,"" the caller exclaims. ""Sandy Hook school please!"" For victims' families, Sandy Hook 911 calls reopen wounds . Audio recordings of 911 calls released Wednesday -- nearly one year after the second-deadliest shooting in U.S. history -- offered a glimpse into the horror that day last December at Sandy Hook Elementary School. The recording also revealed the composure of the 911 dispatchers who received the first calls for help. Town dispatchers are heard calmly responding to tense calls from school staff. Dispatchers assure them help is on the way and ask about the children. Staff members are told to stay inside the school and to take cover. Gunfire is heard in at least two of the calls. The December 14, 2012, massacre left 20 first-graders and six school employees dead, and galvanized calls for stricter gun control throughout the nation. The first 911 call was made about 9:35 a.m. -- with the first police officers arriving at the school less than four minutes later, investigators said. The shooter, Adam Lanza, 20, shot himself less than five minutes after that call. An investigative report released last month described Lanza, a former Sandy Hook student, as an antisocial young man obsessed with mass killings. Police said Lanza shot his mother, Nancy, sometime between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m., using a .22-caliber rifle. Then Lanza got into his car and drove a few miles to the school -- armed with a Bushmaster rifle, a Glock 10-millimeter pistol, a Sig Sauer 9-millimeter pistol and a large supply of ammunition, investigators said. Lanza shot open the glass window on the lobby door at the school. CNN Poll: Support for stricter gun control fades . The second call comes from school custodian Rick Thorne. ""I believe there's shooting at the front glass,"" Thorne says. ""There something going on."" ""Okay I want you to stay on the line with me,"" the dispatcher counsels. ""Where are you in the school? ""I am down the corridor."" ""All right I want you to take cover ... All right, get everybody you can going down there. "" ""The front glass is all shot out..."" ""... What about the students in the building?"" ""Everything is locked up as far as I know."" The dispatcher keeps his composure as the staff member reports that the shooting is continuing. ""No it's still going on,"" the custodian reports. ""I can't get over there."" ""I don't want you to go over there. I want to know what's happening with the students, though ... Do you see anything or hear anything more?"" ""I keep hearing shooting,"" the custodian says. ""I keep hearing popping!"" The release of the 911 details Wednesday involved calls made on landlines from the school to police in Newtown. Other calls, including those routed to other law enforcement agencies, were not part of the release. Last week, Connecticut Superior Court Judge Eliot Prescott upheld the Connecticut Freedom of Information Commission's ruling to release calls related to the shooting. A state attorney had tried to block the release to shield the victims' families; the Associated Press had challenged authorities' refusal to release the 911 tapes. Wednesday's release, which was supervised by town attorneys, came in the wake of local opposition, and the judge's ruling. And the release left news organizations with hard choices difficult about what to broadcast from the events of a shattering day in the lives of a small, quiet town and an entire nation. Neil Heslin, whose 6-year-old son Jesse Lewis was killed in the rampage, has listened to parts of the 911 tapes. ""I wish they weren't released. It's just a sad reminder of what happened, and clearly the day is etched in my mind,"" he told CNN's Piers Morgan. The shooter's aunt, Marsha Lanza, questioned the timing of the release so close to the one-year anniversary. ""I think emotions are very raw and (it's) too soon,"" she said. ""I really believe they needed to wait."" Media outlets cautious as Newtown 911 recordings released . Investigators have said that Lanza entered the school and moved down the hallway. His first victims were Principal Dawn Hochsprung and school psychologist Mary Sherlach, who had heard glass shattering and ""loud banging,"" according to the report. They went into the hallway, with Hochsprung warning a third staff member to ""Stay put!"" Both were shot to death. The staff member was also shot but survived and called 911. At one point, a female dispatcher tells her colleagues of the mass shooting: ""Guys, we got a shooting at Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown! That's why 911 is ringing off the hook."" Another dispatcher handles a call from a man inside the school. ""There's still shooting going on. Please!"" the caller exclaims. A banging sound is heard. ""What about injuries at this time?"" ""I don't know of any injuries right now."" ""OK,"" a dispatcher is heard telling a colleague, ""I need you to call state police..."" A gunshot blast is heard. ""It's still, still going on!"" the male caller says. A teacher calls from her classroom. ""It sounds like there are gunshots in the hallway,"" she says. ""OK, do you have everyone in the classroom and the door is locked?"" the dispatcher asks calmly. ""All of my students, the door is not locked yet. I have to go...I have to go lock the door ... "" ""Keep everybody calm, keep everybody down. Get everybody away from the windows, OK?"" Some staff members took shelter in the school's main office as Lanza moved toward two classrooms where he killed 20 children and four adults. Others protected and tried to calm their students. ""In fewer than 11 minutes, 20 first-grade pupils and six adults had lost their lives,"" the report said. The killings in Newtown, about 60 miles outside New York, happened less than five months after a similar bloodbath at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, outside Denver. Those mass slayings triggered a nationwide debate over gun violence, school safety and mental health, a debate that produced some new restrictions on firearms in several states. A backlash by gun-rights advocates followed . A new CNN/ORC International survey found that 49% of Americans say they support stricter gun control laws, with 50% opposed. The 49% support is down six percentage points from the 55% who said they backed stricter gun control in CNN polling from January, just a few weeks after the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School .

"(CNN) -- Happy birthday, Lady Liberty! The Statue of Liberty turns 128 on Tuesday, and she's never looked better. Still tall and regal, you may overlook this American icon because she's been around for so long. But trust us: She's kind of a badass. Here are 5 reasons why: . 1. She's on her #selfie game . Head on over to the ""Crown Cam"" to check out this hot ""statue selfie."" It's just one of a few cameras set up at EarthCam.com to capture the action on Ellis Island. 2. The hip-hop crowd loves her . Want some street cred? Throw a line in your rap song about La Liberty, and it's all good. From Jay Z's ""Empire State of Mind"" (""Statue of Liberty, long live the World Trade"") to Ludacris' ""Undisputed"" (""So put ya fist up, even the Statue of Liberty lit a flame for the way that I lit my wrist up""), she is hailed. 3. She celebrates holidays . The Statue of Liberty will reportedly do some crossdressing for Halloween. Designer Nick Graham has said he will outfit her in a few bow ties to celebrate both the holiday and the launch of his new menswear line. The 60-foot, 35-pound bow ties won't actually be draped around the statue but will be flown near it using helicopters for a quick photo op. ""I was just thinking of something that would be fun to do, dressing up something very large,"" Graham told ABC News. ""Mount Rushmore is too far from here, so the next best thing is the Statue of Liberty."" Speaking of costumes, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery -- and there's a ""sexy Statue of Liberty"" outfit for sale. 4. She's all about social media . It would be a monumental misstep if Lady Liberty wasn't on Twitter, right? The statue often retweets fans sharing their experiences visiting her. And she has a Facebook page that features facts and historical photos. Now we're just waiting for her Instagram account. 5. She is a total New Yorker . Cosmopolitan, elegant, tough under pressure and a survivor (remember when she closed during the government shutdown?), it's no wonder when TV and movie directors want to show the city in all its glory, there is a shot of her front and center. Carrie Bradshaw has nothing on you, Lady Liberty.","The Statue of Liberty turns 128 on Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- He is the new leader of the most populous Arab nation. But Egypt's interim president Adly Mansour is, in many respects, a mystery man. Profiles of him in local and international media have stuck to the basics -- where he was born, where he went to school, how he fared in his last job. Facts that hardly offer an insight into how Mansour will run the country until new elections are called -- whenever that may be. But his low-key demeanor might be the very reason the military picked him, analysts say. ""He represents what the military needs, a fairly low-profile but respected technorat,"" said David Hartwell, a Middle East and North Africa analyst at Jane's Islamic Affairs. One of his main roles will be to help draft a constitution, a job he is well-versed in as the head of the nation's Supreme Constitutional Court. The Egyptian people have given me the authority ""to amend and correct the revolution of the 25th of January 2011,"" Mansour said. Egypt's revolution, which led to the toppling of Hosni Mubarak after three decades in power, started that day. More than two weeks later, Mubarak was ousted. Work spans two regimes . Mansour was born in Cairo, and attended law school at a local university before heading to Paris for studies. Appointed vice president of the court in 1992 by Mubarak, he is also one of its longest serving judges. Deposed President Mohamed Morsy appointed him to the judicial role last month after the former chief''s term expired. He assumed the top judiciary post as a result of a law that mandates that the chief should be hired from within the system. His work spans two regimes -- Mubarak's and Morsy's. The latter was deposed Wednesday after a year in power. Mansour also helped draft the elections laws that set the time frame for campaigning in the 2012 vote that brought Morsy to power, the state-run Al-Ahram newspaper reported. ""The Muslim brotherhood will try to say he is part of the judicial conspiracy against them,"" Hartwell said. ""However that's unlikely to carry weight. He is fairly balanced and has made legally sound decisions in the judiciary."" Viewed as an independent . The 67-year-old is married and a father of three. Though virtually unknown -- no one was chanting his name on the streets as a potential replacement -- he is viewed as an independent. ""In a sense, you could argue that's what the military wanted,"" Hartwell said. The army seized power after Mubarak was toppled, but lost popularity after cracking down on continuing protests. Morsy's election win last year was welcomed as win over military rule. ""This time, they (military) are looking to perform an indirect role,"" Hartwell said. ""They don't have any desire for some kind of public body."" During the anti-Morsy protests that led to his ouster, some opposition groups had called for the head of the constitutional court to take over the running of the country. Mansour's appointment is likely to appease them. He will ""establish a government that is strong and diverse,"" said Gen. Abdel-Fatah El-Sisi, the nation's  top military officer. Until parliamentary elections are held, the interim president will have the power to issue constitutional declarations.

"Washington (CNN) -- The House and the Senate aren't going to have all of the fun this election year. Governors are sure to get a slice of the pie with 36 races on tap. While not as high-profile as many congressional races, gubernatorial campaigns are statewide races and can reveal political and policy trends that play out nationally. Governors often drive legislative agendas in their states and many possess broad authority to act unilaterally on policy and other matters that can impact millions of people. States enacted around 40,000 laws last year on issues that ranged from same-sex marriage to the use of teen tanning beds. 5 House races to watch in 2014 . Governors have final say on funding for middle school computers as well as public safety programs. They can reject or approve new voter ID laws and limits on abortion. Additionally, the State House is often a spring board to the White House. Many Presidents -- including four of the past six -- were governors first. Here are five gubernatorial races to watch in 2014: . Texas . Gov. Rick Perry is retiring, opening the door for a newcomer. While Texas is a solidly Republican state, the liberal left is heavily involved as they see a winner in candidate Wendy Davis. A state Senator, Davis rose to prominence last June when she filibustered a bill that would make it much more difficult for Texas women to obtain an abortion. The left got behind her and helped propel her candidacy for governor. Stuart Rothenberg of the non-partisan Rothenberg Political Report wrote that Davis faces an uphill battle with the still-to-be-determined Republican candidate holding an advantage in the reliably red state. Still, Democrats, he said, have incentive to push for her victory. ""Democrats and liberals believe that long-term demographic trends will turn Texas purple, and Davis' effort could speed up that process, they hope. Moreover, she could well be a national fundraising machine for liberal groups, no matter how realistic her prospects,"" he wrote. Ohio . The Buckeye State is a perennial battleground in presidential races, so anyone leading it factors into the bigger conversation. This year, Gov. John Kasich is asking voters for a second chance. Elected in 2010 with the support of the tea party, the former Congressman initially championed conservative agenda that included dramatic cuts to state pensions. But he ran into trouble with fellow Republicans during the 2012 presidential election when he touted Ohio's vastly improved economy during his time in office, a talking point that did not mesh with Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney. His campaign focused heavily on U.S. economic difficulties. Mostly ignored, shifts emerge in the politics of poverty . And as in any battleground state, the party not in power often has a shot. Polls show Kasich and the leading Democratic contender, Ed FitzGerald, in a close matchup. A tough general election fight, however, is not in the cards yet. Kasich must first win a primary sought by conservatives . disappointed with Kasich's decision to expand Medicaid for the poor. The funding for that comes from federal money made available as part of President Barack Obama's health care reforms that are detested by most Republicans and a centerpiece of their campaign overall to defeat Democrats in November. Kasich's Republican challenger: tea party leader Ted Stevenot. Florida . The primary will be the first real test for the governor's race in one of the most populous and politically important states. Former Republican Gov. Charlie Crist is now Democratic gubernatorial candidate Charlie Crist. Crist has a long political history in the Sunshine State. Instead of running for re-election in 2010, he aimed for the Senate. But he was bested in the GOP primary by tea party favorite Marco Rubio, which led Crist to change his affiliation to Independent. He still lost that election. Now he's trying again for the post he once held. If he wins his primary against state Sen. Nan Rich, he'll face Republican incumbent Rick Scott, whose tenure has been tenuous. A recent Tampa Bay Times/Bay News 9 and AM 820 News poll in the vote-rich Tampa Bay area found that 44% of respondents said Scott is doing a ""not so good"" or ""poor"" job. The non-partisan Rothenberg Political Report rates this race as a tossup and likely to be extremely expensive. A competitive statewide fight will be very closely noted by 2016 White House contenders -- who may include Rubio -- to detect campaign and voter trends in what's been a presidential battleground in the past. Wisconsin . Republican incumbent Scott Walker is running for re-election -- again. This will be his third election in four years. He was forced into a recall election in 2012 after Democrats successfully forced a vote in response to severe cuts in state pensions as a budget-cutting measure. Walker won his recall bid with 53% of the vote, 1% more than his 2010 election. While Cook rates this race as a likely win for Walker, Democrats are rallying behind Mary Burke, a member of the Madison school board and former Trek bike executive. This race is also notable because Walker could be making a play for a possible 2016 presidential run. Illinois . Democrats don't hold that many gubernatorial seats, so keeping this one in Democratic hands is critical. It is a reliably Democratic state and home to the President, so a loss would be especially difficult for a party that has lost ground in state legislatures in recent years. Whether they like it or not, Democrats have incumbent Pat Quinn as their candidate. The race is considered a tossup by Cook even though Republicans don't yet have a strong candidate. Quinn has angered and pleased Democrats in the past month alone. He signed a bill that cut state pensions, angering unions, and approved a measure legalizing same-sex marriage, pleasing social liberals. The Chicago Tribune wrote that his actions could benefit him politically. If so, that's a stark shift from the just a couple months earlier when he tangled with the Democratic-controlled state Legislature. The Rothenberg Political Report wrote during Quinn's tumultuous fall, ""Democrats' saving grace could be the ineptness of the state Republican Party."" 5 Senate races to watch in 2014 .","There are 36 gubernatorial races on tap in 2014 .

"(CNN) -- In the end, it was a single moment that brought the hostage crisis to its dramatic finish. Capt. Richard Phillips, right, stands with U.S. Navy Cmdr. Frank Castellano after Phillips' rescue Sunday. Three gunshots. All three fatal. Fired in the dark by three specially trained U.S. Navy SEALs as the pirates' boat rocked in the water off Somalia. ""Phenomenal shots -- 75 feet away,"" said Navy Vice Adm. Bill Gortney, who oversees the region. A senior defense official said each was a shot to the head. Gortney, in an interview Monday with CNN's ""American Morning,"" described critical steps that led to the rescue of U.S. Capt. Richard Phillips, who was taken by pirates after they boarded his merchant ship, the Maersk Alabama, east of Somalia on Wednesday. Four pirates had been holding Phillips in a small lifeboat, which had run out of fuel. ""One of their pirates had left the lifeboat, needed medical attention and jumped onto one of our inflatable boats,"" Gortney said.  Watch Gortney describe how SEALs shot pirates » . Gortney told CNN's Barbara Starr that the USS Bainbridge rammed the lifeboat Saturday to keep it from trying to return to the Somalian shore about 20 miles away. ""At one point, actually, the two vessels collided"" as the captain of the Bainbridge tried to hold off the lifeboat, Gortney said. Gortney, in the ""American Morning"" interview, said one of the pirates needed medical attention and ""jumped onto one of our inflatable boats.""  Watch report on how Navy deals with pirates » . The pirate's need for medical help was a credit to the Maersk's crew. When the pirates boarded their vessel, a tussle ensued, during which one of the crewmen stabbed the pirate in the hand. Four days later, the pirate's departure from the lifeboat to accept U.S. medical help -- and try to negotiate the captive's release -- left only three for the U.S. snipers to keep their eyes on. The three were tired, Gortney said. ""The sea state was picking up. They agreed for us to tow them into little better waters as the ship was bouncing around. It was very tense."" The on-scene U.S. commander of the Bainbridge, which had come to try to negotiate the captain's release, could see the three remaining pirates ""were very, very intense. One of them held his AK-47 in the back of the captain. We were always concerned about the imminent danger to the captain."" The pirates had repeatedly threatened to kill Phillips, Gortney said. A Navy SEAL team had parachuted in and taken up positions on the Bainbridge's back deck. The military had orders from President Obama authorizing lethal force if there was imminent danger.  Watch how rescue played out hour by hour » . ""At one point, as uncomfortable as the pirates were, they exposed themselves where there was an opportunity,"" Gortney said. He gave details of that ""exposure"" at a news conference Sunday. He said two of the pirates had their heads and shoulders exposed, while the third was visible in the boat's pilot house, through a window. ""The on-scene commander saw that one of the pirates still held that AK-47, was very, very concerned for the captain's life -- and he ordered the shots to be taken,"" Gortney said Monday. Even with the small boat ""moving up and down a couple of feet,"" the SEALs hit their targets. ""Remarkable marksmanship,"" Gortney said. The moment came at 7:19 p.m. (12:19 p.m. ET) Sunday -- after sundown, military officials say. In the minutes after, a special operations team shimmied along the tow rope to the lifeboat, confirmed that three pirates had been killed and took Phillips back to the Navy ships that had gathered nearby. The fourth pirate was taken into custody. ""These guys [the SEALs] are very well trained, they have a lot of experience and there has to be a lot of communication between the shooters and the people making the decision that they all three had shots, that they could make their shots successfully,"" retired U.S. Navy SEAL Dick Couch said on ""American Morning."" He added, ""Credit that on-scene commander with making a timely decision.""

"(CNN) -- The world of football is mourning the loss of Senzo Meyiwa after the South Africa captain was shot and killed Sunday during a botched robbery, according to authorities. Meyiwa, 27, was killed by intruders who went into a house in the Vosloorus township near Johannesburg, police said. The goalkeeper, who won six international caps for his country, was also captain of Orlando Pirates -- a club he first joined as a 13-year-old. His last match was Saturday when the Pirates advanced to the semifinals of the South African League Cup with a 4-1 win over Ajax Cape Town. Orlando Pirates held a news conference Monday paying tribute to Meyiwa in which it also announced that its derby match against Kaizer Chiefs Saturday will be postponed as a mark of respect. Orlando Pirates chairman Dr Irvin Khoza told reporters: ""We are devastated. We had a session with the players this morning where as the chairman I needed to manage the situation. It's not easy to hold back emotions especially on an event like this one. ""Senzo was not an ordinary player, he was a national and club captain. It was only natural that there would have been some tears this morning. I encouraged it."" Dr Khoza added: ""Senzo has been here since he was 13 years old. And he has written his legacy in this club. He put us on the map around the world."" Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs put aside their rivalry Sunday as Kaizer Chiefs players showed their support for their rival players by visiting the hospital in which Meyiwa had been admitted. Meyiwa's international teammates also mourned the loss, with a number of South Africa players taking to Twitter to pay their respects. South Africa coach Shakes Mashaba, who also attended the Pirates' news conference, paid tribute to a man he appointed as the nation's captain. Meyiwa made his debut for South Africa in June 2013 and had played in the last four African Nations Cup qualifiers, keeping four clean sheets in the process. Mashaba said: ""As we were sitting preparing for the [African Nations Cup qualifier] against Sudan, it was Senzo's name that was top of the list -- as player and captain. We called him one day to ask him one thing, and one thing only: be the link between the team and technical staff. ""Since he took on that role, we never had issues with the team and staff, we never had issues with players coming to us after that. He had that personality that meant that he could easily diffuse a situation."" Mashaba added: ""A good guy like Senzo will never just vanish. His spirit will live forever. Senzo was not just a goalkeeper, he was a peacemaker. That's the biggest thing I remember about him."" Meyiwa's death was not only mourned by former teammates and colleagues, but players and officials from around the globe -- including FIFA president Sepp Blatter -- as well as sportsmen from beyond the world of football. South Africa's minister of sport and recreation, Fikile Mbalula, spoke of his regret at the loss of an ""icon"" who had left this world ahead of his time. ""The death of Senzo Meyiwa has robbed this country of an icon and a legend in the making. Senzo died at the time when his career was reaching full maturity and the nation and the world were still expecting a lot from him,"" he said in a statement. ""Just as the star illuminates, criminals rob us of its brightness. Senzo joins other sporting heroes who died when the country and the world was still expecting more from them.""","Meyiwa was shot and killed Sunday night during a botched robbery, authorities said.

"Washington (CNN) -- It has happened before: Aurora. Columbine. Tucson. Virginia Tech. But, this time, the White House and a growing number of Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill promise it will be different. This time, they say, things will change. In Washington and around the country, the legacy left by the 26 people -- 20 of them young children -- slaughtered in a school shooting on Friday in Newtown, Connecticut, might indeed be meaningful legislative reform. Over the past few days, several lawmakers have promised to introduce or reintroduce gun control legislation, ranging from a reinstatement of a federal ban on assault weapons to banning the sale of high-capacity magazines. On Monday, there was a moment of silence on the floor of the U.S. Senate to honor those killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School. The chamber's chaplain called on lawmakers to ""act promptly."" The House also observed a moment of silence Monday evening. Latest updates out of Newtown, Connecticut . ""To me and to others, this one feels different,"" said Jon Vernick, co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research. ""Maybe because of the timing, maybe because of the victims, 20 young children. Maybe it's because we have a president who has been re-elected who is not going to be running again. That doesn't mean those political obstacles aren't still there, but it does feel different."" Friday, just after the shooting, White House spokesman Jay Carney said President Barack Obama was willing to consider reinstating the assault weapons ban that expired in 2004. On Sunday, in his remarks at the vigil in Newtown, Obama hinted that he'll ""use whatever power this office holds to engage my fellow citizens ... in an effort aimed at preventing more tragedies like this. Because what choice do we have?"" On Monday, the White House inched closer to addressing what Carney called a complex problem. And Tuesday afternoon, Carney said the president now supports Sen. Diane Feinstein's intended effort to reinstate the assault weapons ban. Will Newtown change America's attitude toward guns? Pro-gun Democrats . The most notable shift in tone comes from some conservative Democrats who have high rankings from the National Rifle Association for their pro-gun rights legislative stances. Friday's shooting was a ""game changer,"" tweeted Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner, who'd previously received an ""A"" rating from the NRA. ""This awful massacre of our youngest children has changed us, and everything should be on the table,"" Sen. Joe Manchin, a conservative Democrat from West Virginia and ""proud gun owner,"" said Monday in a statement. ""We need to move beyond dialogue -- we need to take a sensible, reasonable approach to the issue of mass violence."" New Jersey Democrat Sen. Frank Lautenberg plans to reintroduce legislation in the next Congress that would prohibit the sale of high-capacity magazines, his office confirmed Monday. He and California Sen. Feinstein hail from states that advocates of gun control, such as the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, say have some of the toughest gun restrictions. Feinstein announced Sunday she'll reintroduce an assault weapons ban when Congress reconvenes in January. Movement in the White House . Citizen-created petitions on the White House's website have netted thousands of signatures on both sides of the issue in just a few days. But the political reality is that crafting meaningful legislation is a tricky prospect. The White House has said Obama supports reinstatement of a federal ban on assault weapons -- a position he took in the 2008 campaign but failed to press during his first term. ""It does remain a commitment of his,"" Carney told reporters Friday. But later that day, an emotional Obama did not address the issue directly in a televised statement from the White House. ""We're going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics,"" said Obama, the father of two girls. A White House source told CNN that on Monday afternoon, Obama had discussions with White House senior staff, the vice president and several Cabinet members, including Education Secretary Arne Duncan, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and Attorney General Eric Holder to begin looking at ways the country can respond to the tragedy in Newtown. The politics of guns . Obama largely avoided the issue of gun control during his first term. He wrote an opinion piece two months after the 2011 assassination attempt on Rep. Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona, acknowledging the importance of the Second Amendment right to bear arms and called for a focus on ""effective steps that will actually keep those irresponsible, law-breaking few from getting their hands on a gun in the first place."" Jared Loughner sentenced to life in deadly Arizona shootings . But in the aftermath of that shooting and as the election season loomed, the Justice Department backed off from a list of recommendations that included measure designed to help keep mentally ill people from getting guns. There are also other political considerations. While Democratic lawmakers took to the airwaves this weekend to call for congressional action on gun control, the few Republicans who did speak out pointed to numerous court cases that have upheld Second Amendment rights and said guns are needed as mechanisms for self-defense. And others have said the solution is more guns in schools, not fewer. Texas Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert said on ""Fox News Sunday"" that if school principal Dawn Hochsprung had an assault rifle in her office, she could have killed the shooter. ""I wish to God she had an M-4 in her office locked up -- so when she heard gunfire, she pulls it out and she didn't have to lunge heroically with nothing in her hands,"" Gohmert said. ""But she takes him out, takes his head off, before he can kill those precious kids."" NRA big supporter of politicians . Protecting those Second Amendment rights has also included hefty campaign donations. During the 2012 election cycle, the NRA donated $719,596 to candidates. Republicans received $634,146 of that, according to the Center for Responsive Politics' analysis of federal campaign data. For example, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, ranked among the top five recipients, having received $7,450 in this cycle. Some $85,450 went to Democrats, many of them in states that are considered more conservative when it comes to gun control laws. For example, Democratic Rep. Jim Matheson got $6,950 this cycle and represents a district in Utah, a state gun control policy advocates say has some of the nation's weakest gun laws. A number of Democratic lawmakers who hail from conservative states are up for re-election in 2014, which may also increase the pressure not to touch the gun issue. Analysis: Guns and the law . Gun policies are ""still a third rail especially if you're really going to try and do something about it,"" said Alan Lizotte, dean and professor at the State University of New York at Albany's School of Criminal Justice. ""There are a lot of issues there."" According to a new ABC News/Washington Post survey on gun control conducted over the weekend, 52% of people see the mass shootings as a sign of broader problems in society. This up from 24% in August shortly after the deadly theater shooting in Aurora, Colorado. The poll also found rise in people who strongly favor stricter gun control, 44%, and a double-digit gap between them and the 32% who say they strongly oppose stricter gun control laws. In August, 39% supported tougher laws and 37% opposed them. A Pew poll conducted after the Giffords shooting found that 49% of Americans said it was ""more important to protect the rights of Americans to own guns,"" while 46% said it was ""more important to control gun ownership."" But a survey conducted by CNN/ORC International in August shortly after the Aurora incident found that 76% of those surveyed believe ""there should be some restrictions on owning guns."" And as debate is sure to ensue in Washington, so it has already online. ""You can make as many laws as you want it will NOT change people who want to hurt others. We all need to arm our self now. That is the only way,"" reader Steve Lahey commented on CNN.com. Which prompted another reader to reply: ""That worked so well for the shooter's mother, didn't it?""

Although other UK container ports such as Felixstowe have greater capacity --processing 3.74 million TEU (20-foot Equivalent Units) in 2011, according to the World Shipping Council, compared to London Gateway's 3.5 million TEU annual limit -- the team behind the Thames project believe their location and state-of-the-art facilities will give them a competitive edge. ""This will be a world class port that the UK will be proud of, a national asset, "" said London Gateway CEO, Simon Moore. ""(We're) trying to bring the biggest ships in the world as close as we can to the biggest point of consumption which is here and in the southeast."" Bigger and better? A pier 2.7 kilometers (1.68 miles) long with six separate deep-water berths ensures giant vessels like the CMA CGM Marco Polo and the recently launched Maersk Triple E class of ships -- which require deeper berths and giant high-speed cranes to reach across vast vessel decks -- will be able to dock there (although there are currently no arrangements for the Triple E to come to the UK). An extensive new set of road, railway and hinterland infrastructure services, meanwhile, will keep all goods moving rapidly towards their final destinations. See also: 8 of the world's biggest infrastructure projects . According to London Gateway supply chain manager, Peter Ward, it is important the UK has these advanced facilities to ensure it isn't cut off or isolated from its trading partners. ""The ships that are out there are getting bigger and it's necessary that we have this kind of infrastructure to handle the UK's global trade,"" Ward said. As it stands, only a handful of other ports around the world have the infrastructure to host behemoths like the Triple E and Marco Polo. The Triple E is currently the world's largest vessel, stretching 400 meters in length with a record container capacity of 18,000 TEUs. Although it was only delivered in June there are already rumors of even bigger ships in the pipeline. In an interview with CNN earlier this year Maersk's COO, Morten H. Engelstoft, said the Danish firm will seek to utilize the Triple E class over other vessels in the Maersk fleet on its AE10 Asia to Europe route because they are cheaper to operate, provide greater economies of scale and are more fuel efficient. A knock-on effect of such policies, some industry experts claim, is that ports along the way will have to adapt their facilities (or start from scratch in the case of London Gateway) to cater for the increased importance of these giant ships. See also: Introducing the world's biggest ship . According to Professor Kevin Cullinane of Napier University's Transport Research Institute, the largest ports will be forced to react purely because of the market influence of large firms such as Maersk. ""In the case of Maersk being the first to (introduce these large ships) bigger ports will have to respond as they wield such clout, especially in that market of Asia and Europe,"" Cullinane said. He points to a dispute between Maersk and the Port of Singapore in the year 2000 when the Danish firm moved its local operations to nearby Malaysia as a warning of what may happen if ports don't respond to the needs of the biggest shipping companies. Ports of call . While some are convinced that larger ships will have a huge impact on future port development, others aren't so sure. Marc Levinson, the author of the ""The Box: How the Shipping Container Made the World Smaller and the World Economy Bigger,"" believes larger ships won't necessarily mean all ports have to invest in new dredging or crane facilities or face being cast adrift. ""The ship lines would like to promote the idea that a port that can't cater for the very largest vessels would be in trouble,"" he explained, ""(but) there is already a significant problem with overcapacity at ports around the world."" Levinson also points out that there are limitations on where the largest ships can travel that limits their use outside of very particular routes. The Triple E class is too big for any port in the United States whilst the very largest ships still won't be able to fit through the Panama Canal even after its $5.25 billion expansion is completed later this year. See also: Can Gondolas cut city traffic . The changing nature of global trade meanwhile means that in years to come the busy Asia to Europe routes may not be as important as they are today. ""We are already seeing that important pieces of manufacturing are beginning to shift from China and East Asia to Africa,"" Levinson said. ""Africa's ports aren't in a position to have Triple Es. They're going to have smaller vessels that can service the East coast of the U.S. and Europe as there will be a lot of trade there."" ""The Triple Es and similarly large ships will be important going forward but there are going to be vessels of smaller sizes that will still have an important role within the industry,"" he added.","London Gateway is a new deep water container port on the Thames Estuary near London .

"(CNN) -- Could another zoo in Denmark kill a giraffe named Marius? To some animal lovers, it sounds too terrible to be true, but zoo leaders say it's anything but a tall tale. Just days after the Copenhagen Zoo killed a male giraffe named Marius to avoid inbreeding, another zoo said it might follow suit. Jyllands Park Zoo said Thursday it may also have to ""euthanize"" one of its male giraffes -- coincidentally, also named Marius -- if a female is brought in to breed. Zoologist Jesper Mohring-Jensen told CNN that Jyllands Park Zoo joined the same breeding program as the Copenhagen Zoo last year, which means it can't have too many giraffes with the same genetic makeup. The zoo currently has two male giraffes, he said. One, Marius, is not deemed useful to the program but is a useful companion to the genetically valuable second giraffe, which is in fact an older brother of the Marius killed in Copenhagen. The zoo wants the second giraffe to mate, so it must bring in a female giraffe. ""At the moment, they are doing very well and are keeping each other company, but if there are some genetically more valuable giraffes in the program that need the space, we have to decide what to do with him,"" said Mohring-Jensen. ""We will of course try to place him in a suitable zoo, but if that is not possible, we might have to euthanize him. The program will give us notice well in advance, so I think we will have a good chance of placing him."" It's thought that no decision is imminent, ""so the problem is not acute,"" he said. Death threats . The killing of the Copenhagen Zoo's Marius opened wide divisions between animal lovers and zoo officials concerned about maintaining the genetic diversity of giraffes in the program. Staff at the zoo received death threats as debate raged online over the killing, which took place despite a petition signed by thousands of animal lovers. But Lesley Dickie, executive director of the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria, a European body governing 345 institutions, said those protesting were missing the point. ""I'm afraid that when we have limited space in zoos -- and it's limited because of problems in the wild, of course, and more and more animals need our help -- then we sometimes have to make these really tough decisions,"" he said. 'Surplus problems' Bengt Holst, scientific director at the Copenhagen Zoo, told CNN the decision was made for the greater good of the giraffe population. ""Our giraffes are part of an international breeding program, which has a purpose of ensuring a sound and healthy population of giraffes,"" he said. ""It can only be done by matching the genetic composition of the various animals with the available space. ... When giraffes breed as well as they do now, then you will inevitably run into so-called surplus problems now and then."" The Copenhagen Zoo's Marius was shot by a veterinarian with a rifle as he leaned down to munch on rye bread, a favorite snack. After a necropsy, the giraffe was dismembered in front of an audience that included children and fed to the zoo's lions, tigers and leopards. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","Jyllands Park Zoo says it may also have to euthanize a giraffe called Marius .
It will be necessary only if space is needed for a new giraffe and a home cannot be found .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Violence marked the beginning of a two-day referendum as Egyptians went to the polls Tuesday for the second time in 13 months to reshape their country's future. In all, 11 people died Tuesday in events relating to the referendum, Ahmed El Ansary, head of the emergency unit at the ministry of health, told CNN. Two died of natural causes, while nine deaths ""are suspected to be criminal,"" he said. Clashes were reported in several provinces. At least four were killed in Sohag and one in Beni Seouif in clashes between supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood and security. Violations reported by rights groups monitoring the vote ranged between campaigning for ""yes"" votes inside or near polling stations and preventing Christian voters from reaching polling stations in parts of Upper Egypt, which has a history of sectarian strife and is known for the strong presence of Islamist groups. But Hisham Mukhtar, the executive director of the Higher Education Commission, told state-run Masriya TV, ""so far, there haven't been any reports of fraudulent activities and the referendum is being conducted in a very calm and fair atmosphere."" On Monday, Mukhtar told Al-Ahram that the nearly 53 million eligible voters were divided among more than 30,000 committees and would be supervised by more than 13,000 judges. The violence began even before polls opened at 9 a.m., when a bomb exploded near a Cairo courthouse. No one was hurt, security officials said. Despite the explosion, Egyptians waited in long lines to cast their ballots. ""This will not scare us,"" said Mohamed Moharram, a teacher who lives near the court. ""In half an hour, I will go to my poll station and cast my ballot."" Opinion: Egypt mess? Blame U.S. Marred by violence . Tuesday's deaths were but the latest twist in three years of political upheaval marked by two presidential departures and hundreds of deaths. Tuesday's referendum -- the first national vote since the ouster of the democratically elected President Mohamed Morsy -- is about changing the constitution to ban religious parties and give more power to the military. If the draft is passed, elections should follow. A deep political divide is evident between supporters of the interim military government and defenders of Morsy. Protesters near the Cairo court held aloft a poster of Egyptian army chief Gen. Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and chanted, ""People want the execution of the Muslim Brotherhood"" and the ""army and people are one hand."" In an incident outside a Cairo school being used as a polling station, CNN witnessed three uniformed soldiers dragging a man into the school yard. The man was followed by about six people pointing fingers at him and accusing him of being a member of the Muslim Brotherhood. One of the soldiers slapped the man twice in the face, then struck him in his back. As the man cowered, several police officers arrived and dragged the man toward a corner, where they set upon him. As soon as CNN Correspondent Reza Sayah began to record cell phone video of the incident, several of the civilians attempted to block his view, and one of the plainclothes officers ordered him to show his identification -- his permanent press credential and his referendum credential -- and took them both. As Sayah continued to work, the soldier who had slapped the man asked to see the video -- which was nothing more than a jumble of blurred images -- then asked him to delete it. Because ""it was just shaky blur,"" Sayah said, he complied. After about an hour, the plainclothes policeman returned his credentials. One of the soldiers told CNN that they were trying to protect the man from being beaten by police. Another journalist told CNN he had asked the man if that was true, and the man said it was not. At that point, the policeman intervened and shooed the journalist away. Constitutional changes . Egyptians voted on the last constitution in December 2012, while Morsy was still in power. But that constitution was suspended after the military deposed him in July. The latest proposal differs from the last constitution in several ways. Some say the draft constitution would mean improved human rights and freedom of expression. The new version explicitly states that women are equal to men and allows them to hold official and judicial posts, Al-Ahram said. The new articles would also give parliament the right to impeach the President in the event of a breach of the provisions of the constitution, Al-Ahram said. Other new articles would criminalize torture, discrimination and arbitrary forced displacement. Critics say the latest draft would give too much power to the military without any civilian oversight. For example, the draft gives tremendous leeway to the army to try civilians in military courts -- something many Egyptians have opposed for years. Military rule popular with Egyptians, study finds . What's behind Egypt's turmoil . Morsy's opponents said he was a tyrant trying to impose conservative values, but Morsy's supporters say that the military has now returned to the authoritarian practices of longtime ruler Hosni Mubarak, who was deposed in a popular uprising in 2011. Hundreds died in clashes between Egyptian security forces and Morsy supporters in the weeks that followed his ouster. Many in the Muslim Brotherhood hold el-Sisi, as the military chief, responsible for the bloodshed. In a statement issued amid the crisis, el-Sisi said, ""Egypt has room for everybody, and we are keen to save every drop of Egyptian blood."" He added, ""The Egyptian people are free to choose whoever to govern them, while the armed forces will remain the safeguard of the will of the people and of their choice."" Morsy has been in detention since July and faces charges of inciting the murders of at least three protesters outside the presidential palace in 2012. The protests were over the constitution that Morsy shepherded into effect. CNN's Reza Sayah reported from Cairo; Tom Watkins, Salma Abdelaziz, Holly Yan and Saad Abedine reported from Atlanta. Sarah Sirgany, Richard Allen Greene and Laura Smith-Spark also contributed to this report.","Eleven deaths reported on election day in Egypt, 2 attributed to natural causes .

"Washington (CNN) -- Hillary Clinton used her Tuesday appearance in Colorado, where experts see the female vote deciding a number of statewide races, to court women with a personal message about her life and her hopes for the future. Clinton usually targets women voters in her appearances. But in Colorado, the former secretary of state and likely presidential candidate in 2016, spoke about how fortunate she felt to be born in America and the message she hopes to be able to leave with children. The personal remarks, while focused on turning out voters for Democrats Mark Udall, John Hickenlooper and Andrew Romanoff, sounds a great deal like a presidential candidate and resembled a message Clinton could use should she run for president. ""I have had a great set of experiences. I have been very fortunate in my life, but the most fortunate thing besides the parents to whom I was born, is that I was born in America,"" Clinton said. ""I, from the moment of my birth, was blessed because of that. And I grew up believing with all my heart that if I worked hard, if I did was I was supposed to do, go to school, get an education, that I would have opportunities that were never available to my mother."" Clinton added, ""Indeed that came true for me. I don't want that ever to be lost. I want everyone in this room to be able to look at any baby, any child and truthfully say, 'You have the same right to the American dream that I did.'"" Pro-Clinton group adds $2 million to its war chest . This was Clinton's second trip to Colorado in a week. She spent a few hours with Udall last week at a private fundraiser and at a local coffee shop and market to meet voters. Udall is in a tight race with Republican Rep. Cory Gardner, who some polls have slightly ahead. ""The only poll that counts is that poll on election day,"" Udall said, warming up the crowd for Clinton by using a tried-and-true campaign cliche. Democrats in the state and nationally see Clinton as someone who can turn out women in Colorado, a key demographic that some experts see the election turning on. ""This election is important to everybody, but it is especially important to the women of Colorado,"" Clinton said, touching upon a woman's right to choose, personhood laws and availability of birth control - all topics the race between Udall and Gardner have focused on. ""Women's rights here at home and around the world are clearly at risk,"" Clinton said, arguing those rights ""are like the canaries in the mine."" Is Hillary Clinton ready for marijuana's 2016 push? Although Clinton was there to endorse Democrats and increase excitement, her presidential aspirations weren't far from the minds of many. Before Clinton went on, Romanoff tried to pep up the crowd by asking, ""Are you ready to hear from the next president of the United States?"" Even Udall got into the hinting at 2016 action when he said, ""I think we hope she [Hillary Clinton] is going to come back over the next few years.""","Hillary Clinton, who regularly pitches female voters, got personal in her plea on Tuesday.

"(CNN) -- I'm writing this from a Dunkin' Donuts in northern Virginia the day after Hurricane Sandy blasted through, wiping out power to millions of homes, including my own. My 13 year-old daughter sits across from me, doing her homework on her laptop. I'm very grateful that Dunkin' is open and has some outlets in the wall and a decent wireless connection -- though for some reason, they don't have any donuts. So, maybe I'm not in a great place, but I'm lucky. For many families, the storm brought real tragedy, in some cases loss of life and livelihood. Not only is there flooding, with communities devastated, but homes, businesses, and cars have been damaged or lost; for many there are days of missed work -- and missed paychecks. Lower Manhattan on Tuesday morning, with cars strewn about, looked like a scene from ""The Avengers."" Politics: Disaster relief -- Obama, Romney differ on federal role . I've seen rough loss estimates of up to $20 billion, of which perhaps half will be replaced by insurance payouts. The realization of how quickly such a natural event can occur should lead us to consider what all this means in terms of responding to this much devastation. When states face disasters of this proportion, one of the first places they turn for help is the federal government, specifically the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Politics: Will you be able to vote on Election Day? This is as it should be. In fact, it's a great example of why we need a centralized federal government that can respond to states in their time of need. Kind of like an instant recession, a natural disaster is an unexpected event that causes great disruption to the lives of its victims and their communities that is often well beyond the capacity of states to reliably bear. We should of course expect states, as well as private citizens, to respond, and Americans have consistently risen to such moments, showing our deep generosity. It's times like this that ""There but for the grace of God ..."" kicks in for many of us. But neither we as individuals nor our cities or states can do it all ourselves. Imagine, as Mitt Romney has advocated (though not on Tuesday, apparently), that FEMA were eliminated, privatized, or handed off to states in a block grant. Or consider the House Republican budget -- authored by Rep. Paul Ryan and endorsed by Romney during the primaries -- a proposal that would cut 22% from the part of the budget that supports this type of aid to the states, amounting to a loss of $28 billion in 2014, including a $2 billion cut in New York state alone. Further imagine -- and if you've been following the hundreds of thousands of state layoffs of key personnel in recent months, this shouldn't be a stretch -- that a disaster like Sandy occurred at a time when state budgets are already under great strain (as are many families' budgets). Remember, a block grant is a fixed amount that by definition is unable to expand in times of need. In many ways, it's a fair-weather ship that does fine in calm waters but founders in a storm. Welfare (work-based assistance for poor families with kids), for example, was block granted in the mid-1990s, and it worked adequately when the economy was humming. But when the recession hit, it failed as a safety net, especially compared with federal programs like food assistance or unemployment insurance that handily expanded to meet the recession-induced need. Opinion: Sandy debunks 'nanny state' It's unimaginable that we could administer federal disaster relief this way. States like New York and New Jersey would unquestionably need more help in a storm like Sandy, yet we'd have to tell their governors: ""Hey, we'd love to help, but if your block grant doesn't cover it, there's nothing we can do about it."" That's obviously ludicrous, and it's also why you'll see avowed partisans like New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, showing real decency as he stressed Tuesday how helpful the president has been and how important the federal response is in addressing Sandy's impact in his state. I hope the storm is a good reminder that when we hear candidates' soothing words about shedding federal government functions, whether it's FEMA, Medicaid, or safety nets in recession, we must think about what that actually means in practice. Disasters happen, recessions happen -- like it or not, there are market failures and natural disasters in our future. If anything, it seems as though these 100-year storms come about every six months these days. (Which reminds me -- here's a great idea for a big, national infrastructure project that will create millions of jobs for white- and blue-collar workers and save billions in lost output: Bury the power lines!) At the end of the day, we don't need ""big"" government or ""small"" government. What we need is an amply funded federal government to meet challenges like those we're facing today, something I'm afraid Romney and Ryan do not understand. Opinion: Don't let superstorm sway your vote . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jared Bernstein.","Jared Bernstein says Sandy brought loss of life, devastation to homes, businesses, lives .
He says over-burdened states rightly turn to federal government for help from FEMA .
He says Romney, Ryan have proposed block grants for states instead, or privatizing relief .
Writer: Disasters can outstrip block grants; states strapped. In practice, these ideas won't work ."
"(CNN) -- Fourth seed David Ferrer was sent crashing out of the U.S. Open by Frenchman Gilles Simon on Sunday, becoming the biggest men's scalp to be taken so far during the final grand slam of the tennis season, while former women's champion Maria Sharapova also exited. In oppressively humid conditions at Flushing Meadows, Simon and Ferrer traded the first two sets 6-3 before Simon found another level to wrap up the final two sets 6-1 6-3. The 26th seed took advantage of some sloppy play by Ferrer, who made 52 unforced errors and appeared to be struggling physically with the heat in the third-round tie. It was a timely victory for Simon, who had lost five of his past six meetings against the Spaniard. ""He destroyed me five times before,"" Simon said after the match. ""I just tried to stay loose and relaxed and enjoy myself on court. But I am tired. The weather forecast said it would be cooler today but it didn't feel like it. We ran so much and I am happy to finish in four sets because I knew that against David it would be really hard in the fifth."" Simon will play Croatian 14th seed Marin Cilic, who beat South Africa's Kevin Anderson in four sets. ""I always have a tough fight with Marin,"" Simon said after Cilic's victory. Simon has beaten Cilic in his last four encounters but is not taking anything for granted. ""Yes, but did you check the scores?! It was always in five sets! We know each other well. It will be a tough fight."" Roger Federer continued his bid to become the first man to win six U.S. Open titles as he reached the last 16 with a rain-interrupted win against Spain's Marcel Granollers. The 17-time grand slam champion came from behind to triumph 4-6 6-1 6-1 6-1 against the world No. 42, setting up a fourth-round clash with another Spaniard, Roberto Bautista Agut. The 17th seed equaled his best grand slam performance, matching his achievement of reaching the last 16 at January's Australian Open, as he beat France's Adrian Mannarino in straight sets. ""I feel very explosive, quick,"" second seed Federer said. ""The coordination is there, as well. I feel like I've gotten used to the hard courts by now. It's really working well. I'm very pleased."" Seventh seed Grigor Dimitrov also came from behind to beat Belgium's David Goffin in four, and the Bulgarian will next play French 20th seed Gael Monfils. Monfils upset 12th-seeded compatriot Richard Gasquet in straight sets to reach the last 16 in New York for the first time since 2009. Czech sixth seed Tomas Berdych also progressed, beating Russia's Teimuraz Gabashvili 6-3 6-2 6-4 to set up a clash with Austrian debutant Dominic Thiem. Thiem, who turns 21 on Wednesday, eliminated Spanish 19th seed Feliciano Lopez 6-4 6-2 6-3 as he continued his best showing at a grand slam, having lost in the first round at Wimbledon and the second at the Australian and French Opens. Meanwhile former world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki put a nightmare 2014 firmly behind her by knocking out five-time grand slam winner Sharapova 6-4 2-6 6-2 and book her place in the quarterfinals. French Open champion Sharapova was the strong favorite at the Arthur Ashe Stadium, but the Dane dug deep to win the third set and give her a great chance of winning her first grand slam. ""She made me hit a lot of balls,"" Sharapova told reporters. ""That's always been her strength. But she did extremely well today. She's a great retriever, especially in these types of conditions. I just felt like I maybe went for a little too much."" Of all the female players left in the draw, only world No. 1 Serena Williams and formerly top-ranked Victoria Azarenka have ever won a grand slam. ""It means so much to me,"" said Wozniacki after her victory over the fifth seed, who won the 2006 U.S. Open and reached the semifinals in her last appearance in 2012. ""It's been a bit up and down for me this season ... To win today against a champion like Maria is an unbelievable feeling."" Wozniacki, seeded 10th this year, was runner-up in 2009 and made the semis in 2010-11 but has not reached the last four of a grand slam since then. The 24-year-old, who split with golf star Rory McIlroy this year ahead of a planned wedding, will next face Italian 12th seed Sara Errani. Errani, a semifinalist in 2012 after losing in the French Open final earlier that season, ended the dream run of former child prodigy Mirjana Lucic-Baroni as she beat the 32-year-old Croatian 6-3 2-6 6-0. Lucic-Baroni, who came through qualifying and beat world No. 2 Simona Halep in round three, was playing in the last 16 of a grand slam for the first time since 1999 -- when she was a semifinalist at Wimbledon. Belinda Bencic beat former world No. 1 Jelena Jankovic 7-6 (8-6) 6-3 to become the youngest U.S. Open quarterfinalist since 1997, when Martina Hingis went on to win the title. The Swiss 17-year-old, who has trained at the academy run by Hingis' mother, will next play China's Peng Shuai -- who likewise progressed to the last eight of the singles competition for the first time in a grand slam. While Bencic is playing in majors for the first time this year, the 28-year-old Peng made her debut a decade ago and has twice won doubles titles, including the French Open in June. Peng ousted 14th-seeded Czech Lucie Safarova 6-3 6-4, having upset world No. 5 Agnieszka Radwanska in round two. ""The last couple of times I was in the fourth round I would always lose to good players,"" said Peng, who reached the last 16 at Wimbledon after first-round exits in Melbourne and Paris. ""I knew if I was going to win these matches I needed more courage on the court.""","Fourth seed David Ferrer out of U.S. Open, beaten by France's Gilles Simon .

"(CNN) -- I knew there had to be a reason my family and I went through tough days together. I didn't understand why then, but the past couple of weeks have put so much into perspective. The lonely days of pacing around my kitchen seemed like some of the longest days of my life. If anyone had told me then that I would be wearing a crown, an evening gown, heels and a swimsuit in front of a live audience with bright lights and television cameras hovering around, I'd have been the first one to dismiss it. I realize now that even my toughest days pale in comparison to the toughest days of others living with an autism spectrum disorder. I've been given this opportunity to use my voice for those who don't have one or have yet to find theirs. My path may not be one that another person would choose, but I challenged myself to enter the Miss America competition because it seemed like the peak to my own personal Everest. It also seemed kind of ironic: a girl who was told she was different and considered an outcast by many, in the nation's biggest beauty pageant. I knew I would face challenges and even some skepticism, but I never expected the outpouring of support that continues to come in. Winning the America's Choice title during the competition was the highest honor for me. The fact that so many people, to whom I am a total stranger, took the time to elect me as their contestant of choice is something I am still trying to comprehend. The glitz and the glamour may have faded from the wonderful experience of Miss America, but my commitment to raising awareness about autism and building bridges of acceptance grows stronger each day -- especially after I read e-mails, Facebook posts or tweets from the people who have supported my journey. I will be successful if just one person encounters a child who is overstimulated without staring, if one teenager invites an ""outcast"" to lunch or just smiles at him or her, or if one employer gives a job to someone who might not be able to look the interviewer in the eye. I also hope that families reading my story who feel isolated or have concerns and questions about their children know they are not alone -- there is a wonderfully loving community with people just waiting to be your friend and mentor. One thing I have learned in partnering with organizations like AbilityPath.org and Generation Rescue is that the special needs community is one of the most loyal and supportive groups anyone could join. I'm honored to be a part of this new circle of friends, and have no doubt that it was the people who found me relatable and believed in me that helped me become America's Choice. I don't know what tomorrow will bring, but I do know there is a lot for me to do to make sure people really get that ""Normal is just a dryer setting.""","Alexis Wineman was diagnosed with a form of autism at 11 .

"London (CNN) -- A British man suffering from ""locked-in syndrome"" who fought a long legal battle over assisted suicide died Wednesday, his family said. Tony Nicklinson, 58, had been refusing food since last week, contracted pneumonia over the weekend, and ""went downhill rapidly,"" said his lawyer, Saimo Chahal. ""Before he died, he asked us to tweet: 'Goodbye world the time has come, I had some fun,'"" his Twitter account said. The former rugby player was left paralyzed from the neck down by a catastrophic stroke seven years ago, and lost a High Court battle last week to gain a legal right to end his life when he chose. The fight seemed to go out of him after the court's decision, leaving him ""heartbroken,"" Chahal said after his death was announced. His wife, sister and daughters were with him when he died, she said. ""He was gutsy, determined and a fighter to the end,"" said Chahal, adding it had been ""an absolute privilege"" to represent him. His legal case will not continue unless someone ""in similar circumstances"" steps forward to pursue it, she said. Police in the county of Wiltshire, where he lived, said that a doctor had been seeing Nicklinson over the past week, and that they were not investigating the death. His condition meant it was impossible for him to take his own life, and he wanted the legal right to have a doctor take his life without fear of prosecution. ""Most of my body is paralyzed, but my mind is as it was before the stroke. All I can move is my head, and the stroke took away my power of speech. Now I talk to people with a perspex spelling board or a computer operated by my eye blinks,"" he told CNN in an interview in June. While expressing sympathy for his situation, the High Court ruled August 16 that such a significant change to the law -- involving overturning the ban on voluntary euthanasia -- would have to be decided by lawmakers. The judges also rejected a similar challenge to the law brought by a second man suffering from locked-in syndrome, named only as Martin. Psychiatrist: I hate suicide but also understand it . ""The cases raise profoundly difficult ethical, social and legal issues, but (the court) judged that any change to the law must be a matter for Parliament to decide,"" a statement from the court said. The ruling upset Nicklinson, who cried as his wife, Jane, told the waiting media that the family was ""bitterly disappointed"" and would file an appeal. ""All too often, well-meaning able-bodied people just assume that if a person is so severely disabled that he needs assistance to commit suicide, he must automatically be unable to deal with such choice,"" he said in June. ""I say that where a person has the mental ability, he should have the choice of his own life or death. The only difference between you and me is my inability to take my own life,"" he said. In a statement given via his computer last week after the decision, Nicklinson said: ""It's not the result I was hoping for but it isn't entirely unexpected. Judges, like politicians, are happiest when they can avoid confronting the real issues and this judgment is not an exception to the rule. ""I believe the legal team acting on my behalf is prepared to go all the way with this, but unfortunately for me it means yet another period of physical discomfort, misery and mental anguish while we find out who controls my life -- me or the state."" His daughters, tweeting on his behalf, urged people to sign a petition via his Twitter account supporting his ""right to die with dignity."" Within hours, thousands of people had added their names. Jane Nicklinson said the family did not intend to go to Switzerland, which has an assisted suicide law, because it was expensive and her husband did not think he should have to go overseas to die. Before his stroke at age 51, the couple lived a comfortable life in the United Arab Emirates and traveled extensively. Speaking to CNN in June, Jane Nicklinson described her husband before the stroke as a man who was the ""life and soul of the party,"" making his current severely restricted existence even harder to bear. ""He was a big bloke, ex-rugby player, he worked hard but he played hard,"" she said. ""He was full of life, great sense of humor, loved the sound of his own voice.""

"(CNN) -- The recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPPC) report made very clear its view that the world is failing to prepare and adapt to the impacts of man-made climate change -- ""in many cases, we are not prepared for the climate-related risks that we already face."" The challenge isn't new. We have known for some time that we need to act on climate change. This is a global issue requiring a coordinated global response and we need to make the most of the world's talent. As an international ambassador for the People's Postcode Lottery Green Challenge, the largest annual international competition for green entrepreneurs, we are fortunate to see some of the best new ideas in green entrepreneurism. However, while there has been a consistent number of female entries globally each year -- around 20% -- to really encapsulate the potential of a wider talent pool we need to see that percentage increase. As such, it was very uplifting to see that the winners of 2013 and 2012 were women, given that we want to see an increase in female participation. Last year, U.S.-based Ginger Dosier won with her start-up bioMASON which -- inspired by coral reefs -- ""grows"" bricks by using microorganisms for use in building construction. These bricks can be used in place of conventional bricks, consuming far less energy and resources and as a result having a much lower impact on the environment. In 2012, Molly Morse, another U.S.-based entrepreneur, won with her company Mango Materials, which uses bacteria to create biodegradable plastics for construction, toys, packaging or agriculture. She was driven to create more sustainable materials by seeing first-hand the use of temporary construction materials after earthquakes in India. There are more examples from all over the world, such as the idea from Thailand-based, Orapin Sinamonvech, to turn agricultural waste into particle board. Her idea is helping to eliminate CO2 by offering farmers an alternative to burning their unwanted materials. The impact of climate change particularly in the developing nations has a disproportionate impact on women and girls and solutions that reflect that are crucial. If we were able to encourage even a fraction more women to turn their experiences and ideas into reality, then we would be in a much stronger position to meet our climate challenge. With greater need than ever for green businesses and innovations all around the world, l want to see more women seizing these sorts of opportunities. As a woman who has had to overcome barriers, whether it be in my political life or the business sector, I understand that obstacles will not disappear overnight. To this end, I'm about to launch and participate in a mentoring service for women who need support in achieving their ambitions and would encourage other women in my position around the world to do the same. Women have a strong historical record when it comes to sustainability, from Rachel Carson who wrote ""Silent Spring,"" which many credited with igniting the environmental movement, to Vivienne Westwood who as well as campaigning for sustainability in the fashion industry has tried to make sustainability fashionable. We need to build on their record. We should all have an interest in seeing women get ahead. We need to see more creative solutions to reduce climate change and we need to encapsulate a greater pool of imagination and invention. As a start, with less than one month to go to the close of this year's competition, I would urge all female entrepreneurs with sustainability ideas to enter and take up the opportunity that's on offer.

"(CNN) -- They arrive in souped-up sports cars, boasting a potent arsenal of sci-fi weaponry and shape-shifting powers, lining up side by side for the ultimate race to the finish line. In the end, there can only be one winner. Welcome to the battle for Kenya's presidency -- as imagined by a talented young Kenyan animator. Set in a post-apocalyptic world, ""Wageuzi"" is a short 3D animated film showing Kenya's main political leaders fighting for supremacy ahead of the country's critical elections on March 4. The futuristic film sets Kenya's presidential hopefuls against each other in a thrilling, high-octane battle inspired by the Transformers blockbuster franchise. Over the course of some 12 minutes, viewers are treated to a range of industrial cityscapes and gloomy-looking backdrops. Five presidential hopefuls roar through the urban settings as they switch between forms in their bid to outfox each other. Machine guns blazing, they turn from speeding vehicles into mighty robots, before engaging in aerial combat as they try to finish the race first. ""Wageuzi is Swahili, it means 'transformers,'"" explains creator Andrew Kaggia, 25. ""It can also mean 'the changemakers,' because our leaders are the tools for change."" iReport: Kenyan Graffiti for Peace . Kaggia, a Nairobi-based 3D animator working on commercials and TV shows, decided to make the film in the hope that it would inspire people in his country to cast their ballots responsibly. Kenya was engulfed in chaos after its last election in 2007, when post-election violence left more than 1,000 people dead and hundreds of thousands displaced. ""When we had an election in 2007 there really was a lot of violence,"" says Kaggia. ""A lot of bad things happened and basically we needed to see our leaders in their true light. So I thought of doing something sort of controversial using our leaders and creating them in the form of 'Transformers,' seeing how they basically fight for power at whatever cost. ""I wanted people to basically think twice before choosing their leaders,"" he adds. ""To see their leaders as who they are and to vote more wisely."" Throughout the fast-paced film Kaggia has included satirical references to what he sees as the candidates' real-life personalities. ""When people they watch the film, they're able to relate the characters to the actual politicians,"" adds Kaggia, who first released Wageuzi in December 2011 (Kenya's elections were initially scheduled to take place in 2012). ""I think people who watch it are able to actually read between the lines and say 'OK, this is actually how it is.'"" Kaggia says it took him about six months to complete the whole film, working up to 14-15 hours a day. He had to quit his regular job to focus on all aspects of Wageuzi -- from 3D modeling and animation to compositing and lighting. And when Wageuzi did finally come out, it created a splash. ""The first day I released the film [online] I think it got 1,000 views,"" says Kaggia. ""People were really spreading it around."" Read this: Can mobiles help stop Kenya election violence? Kaggia first discovered the art of animation through the Disney cartoons he was watching while growing up, and his style was inspired by the classic beat em' up video game ""Tekken."" ""It blew my mind the first time I saw it,"" he says of the game. ""I started playing around with it and that's how it began."" Today, Wageuzi's success has helped put the spotlight on Kenya's burgeoning animation scene. It's also acted as an example of what can be achieved when talent meets hard work; Kaggia was born with a deformed hand, but that never got in the way of his dreams. ""I refused to let it stop me,"" says Kaggia. ""I decided not to let that be the case I can do this and I won't let anything stop me."" Read this: Kenyan boy scares off lions with flashy invention . With Kenya's critical election fast-approaching, Kaggia says he is hopeful that the violence that rocked his country last time around will not be repeated. ""I think people have learned since 2007,"" he says. ""People are smarter now because they saw that they were actually used by their leaders ... so I don't think there will be such violence.""

"(CNN) -- Federal authorities are investigating threatening letters allegedly containing deadly ricin in Spokane, Washington, the FBI said Thursday. The FBI and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service are trying to find the source of the two letters, intercepted Tuesday during a screening procedure at a postal facility in Spokane, FBI spokeswoman Ayn Sandalo Dietrich said. ""While we cannot offer further comment on this incident, we stress that law enforcement agencies will continue to assess and address the full spectrum of potential threats,"" she said. The American Postal Workers Union was notified of the two suspicious letters by the Postal Service, the union said. One letter was addressed to the Spokane Post Office and the other to a federal judge in Spokane, the union said. Both were postmarked May 14, the union said. Postal Service management told employees they weren't at risk from handling the letters because the suspected substance was not in a form that could be inhaled or readily ingested, the union said. Preliminary lab tests showed the substance to be ricin, the union said. The union is monitoring the situation, President Cliff Guffey said. ""Our members' safety is our primary concern,"" he said in a statement. In an apparently unrelated case, ricin-tainted letters sent to President Obama and others touched off high anxieties in Washington and elsewhere last month. James Everett Dutschke, 41, of Tupelo, Mississippi, has been charged with possession and use of a biological agent as a weapon in connection with those letters sent to Obama and others. If inhaled, injected or ingested, less than a pinpoint of ricin can kill a person within 36 to 48 hours because of the failure of the respiratory and circulatory systems. There is no known antidote.","NEW: Both letters are intercepted Tuesday during postal screening procedure, FBI says .

"Washington (CNN) -- For Joe Biden, an evenly divided Senate would be a BFD. If Tuesday's midterm elections result in a Senate split, the vice president will suddenly find himself in one of his favorite places: the spotlight. Biden would become a crucial player in the Senate, providing the tie-breaking vote on key bills and keeping the chamber in Democratic hands for the twilight years of President Barack Obama's administration. For a politician who spent 36 years in the Senate and has run into trouble conforming to the constraints of being Obama's No. 2, a divide could be a welcome twist to a career that has often confounded expectations. ""Clearly, he is a creature of the Senate,"" said Ted Kaufman, Biden's former chief of staff who filled in as Delaware senator when his boss became vice president. ""I can't think of a better person to be in that position. I know he would relish it."" It's rare for an election to result in an even split in the 100-seat Senate, turning control over to the vice president's party. The last time that happened was after the 2000 election, when Dick Cheney's role as a tiebreaker solidified a GOP majority. That only continued for a few months before a moderate Republican switched parties and gave Democrats full control of the Senate. This year, the GOP needs to post a net gain of six seats to control the chamber and Republicans appear to be on track to do that. But their efforts are being muddied by the enduring strength of Democratic candidates in Kentucky and Georgia, who are within striking distance of claiming Republican seats -- raising the potential of a split Senate. Biden on standby . And even if one party wins a slim majority, Biden could find himself on standby for much of the next two years. Deaths or absences among members -- and the possibility that several independents could switch parties and scramble the Senate's partisan math -- will raise the odds that Biden may be called upon. Biden's role would mostly be limited to casting tie-breaking votes -- not delving into the nitty gritty of legislating. And, of course, tie-breaking votes might be rare in a Senate where most bills now require 60 votes to proceed. But any additional time in the Senate would play to Biden's strengths. Few men in history have adored the clubby chamber as much as Biden and he relishes opportunities to cut deals. ""The United States Senate has been my life — and that is not hyperbole,"" Biden said in his farewell address, summing up a career of melodramatic confirmation hearings, personal tragedy, health scares and failed presidential campaigns. ""It literally has been my life."" Given his affinity for the Senate, it must gall Biden that he is among only 12 of 47 vice presidents not to have cast one of the 244 tie breaking votes, according to Senate historians. Still, as vice president, he has played a crucial role in getting the administration and Senate Republicans out of jams, orchestrating agreements to raise the debt ceiling and avert the fiscal cliff. An expanded role in the Senate could also come in handy for Biden if he decides to launch a long-shot bid for the White House in 2016. Of course, there are potential downsides. Biden slip-ups . If he decides to run for president, he could be forced to take uncomfortable votes that wouldn't play well on the campaign trail. And a larger gig in the Senate could only provide another venue for his legendary slip-ups, which provide endless fodder for the media and plenty of headaches for the White House. He has been on a roll lately — recently apologizing to key Middle Eastern allies for blaming them for the rise of ISIS. In October, Biden quipped that the vice presidency was a ""b—ch of a job, weeks after angering Jewish groups by using the term ""Shylocks"" and calling Asia the ""Orient."" Once, in Delaware, he joked you couldn't go to a 7-Eleven unless you had a ""slight Indian accent."" In a private meeting with black clergy in South Carolina, Biden referred to himself as ""the only white boy on the east side of Wilmington"" as he recalled his days as a Delaware public defender. Touring global hot spots on Air Force Two, Biden sometimes baffles foreign leaders with his break-the-ice line : ""if I had hair like yours I'd be president by now."" He chatted up grandmas at a Senate swearing in ceremony and told Heidi Heitkamp's family to ""spread your legs, you're gonna be frisked."" And in his most famous faux pas, Biden was caught at the White House on a hot mic telling Obama that passing health care reform was a ""big f——g deal. Biden's tongue has sometimes irked the West Wing. In 2012, for instance, he trashed Obama's plans to roll out his backing for gay marriage by committing the cardinal vice presidential sin on ""Meet the Press"" of getting ahead of the boss. Obama's confidence . But White House insiders say Obama values Biden's loyalty and owes him one for steadying the re-election campaign after his own first disastrous debate with Mitt Romney. Vice presidential scholar Joel Goldstein said Biden's influence can be measured in how often Obama reaches into his inner circle for staffers, notably Tom Donilon, Jay Carney and new Ebola czar Ron Klain. ""On the one hand, people have this perception of him as an undisciplined guy because he says things that are viewed as gaffes. But on the other hand to have functioned in the way that he has shows a tremendous amount of discipline."" Biden has been in on every big national security decision, masterminded the withdrawal from Iraq, been a skeptic on military force, managed stimulus spending and gets hours of face time with the president. He has grabbed important national security portfolios including China and mentoring Ukraine's new government. But former secretary of defense Robert Gates wrote that though it was impossible not to like Biden, he had been ""wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades."" Despite his outsized persona, Biden would likely be welcomed back to the Senate warmly even with his eccentricities, according to veteran journalist Jules Witcover, who wrote the vice president's biography. Some members ""thought he talked too much and put his foot in his mouth"" and some Republicans view him as ""a bit of a loose cannon.""","Joe Biden could play a key role in an evenly divided Senate .

"(CNN) -- A twin-engine plane crashed late Friday afternoon in a Fort Lauderdale, Florida, parking lot, killing all three people onboard, authorities said.

Fort Lauderdale fire Division Chief John San Angelo told CNN affiliate WPEC that all three people on the plane died in the crash.

"(CNN) -- This isn't the first time critics have called New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie a bully. But now the man many consider a Republican presidential frontrunner is on the defensive, scrambling to distance himself from an erupting political scandal that threatens to tarnish his image well before the 2016 elections. E-mails that surfaced Wednesday suggest top Christie appointees orchestrated traffic jams on the George Washington Bridge as part of a political vendetta to punish a local mayor who wouldn't support him at the polls. Lane closures around approaches to the country's busiest bridge snarled traffic for days in September in Fort Lee, New Jersey -- a problem the governor and his administration had originally blamed on a mishandled traffic study. In response to the e-mail firestorm, Christie said Wednesday that he was misled by staff. He called the conduct outrageous and said he knew nothing about it. ""This behavior is not representative of me or my administration in any way,"" he said, ""and people will be held responsible for their actions."" Even if he had nothing to do with the traffic snarls, the allegations could have serious consequences for Christie, analysts said. ""There's something about this that's so petty and so vindictive and it feeds into this narrative that he's a bully. ... He's going to have to find some way to defuse this to prove he doesn't run a shop like that,"" said CNN Senior Political Analyst David Gergen, a former adviser to several U.S. presidents. It's a defining moment for Christie, CNN Chief National Correspondent John King said. And how he deals with the situation in the next two days -- from whether he fires anyone to what he says -- will be key. ""If he handles it decisively and then he sits down and calmly answers questions and doesn't berate the reporters who ask them, then he has a chance to be a leader who dealt with a crisis and he moves on,"" King said. ""But if that perception starts to stick in, that's not a presidential temperament. And that's bad for him nationally in his perspective. It's bad for him as he starts his new term in New Jersey. And it's bad for him with the audience he needs to care about most politically long-term at the moment, and that's the Republican base that he wants to make him their nominee."" Does this mean Christie's presidential ambitions are dashed? ""Not necessarily,"" Oxford University historian Timothy Stanley wrote in an opinion piece for CNN.com. ""He's a resourceful politician and it's still many months before campaigning starts in earnest. But now his opponents have a stick to beat him with. Best of all, it's an anti-government stick. If Republicans stand for anything right now, it's opposing the ability of government to mess with the individual's life -- and here we have a classic example of politicians taking revenge on each other at the expense of the average citizen."" Political commentators from both sides of the aisle immediately recognized the potential for credibility questions, particularly around Christie's explanations in recent months about the traffic jams in Fort Lee and previous comments rejecting suggestions of political mischief. ""He's already cemented a narrative as something of a bully,"" said S.E. Cupp, a Republican political strategist and CNN ""Crossfire"" host. ""If this was happening in his administration, I don't think it would shocking."" But, she said, if it ""turns out he's lying about what he knew or whether he ordered it -- that's going to be the worst, the most damaging. Because his authenticity is his calling card."" It's important to ask how much Christie knew, Gergen said, but the reality might be more complicated. ""Sometimes the boss does not order something,"" Gergen said, describing the Nixon White House during the Watergate scandal. ""I don't know whether Nixon ordered Watergate, but I can guarantee you that people who carried out Watergate thought that's what he would have wanted. There's an environment in which you find yourself sometimes on staff when things don't have to be said. You sort of know."" 'Time for some traffic problems' The correspondence, subpoenaed by Democrats investigating the matter and spiced with tough Jersey political talk and expletives, is the most damaging evidence so far supporting their assertions the move was orchestrated because Fort Lee's mayor, a Democrat, didn't endorse Christie's re-election. Mayor Mark Sokolich said the traffic mess created serious hardships for commuters and other residents, and impacted public safety in his community. The exchanges began three weeks before access lanes to the bridge were closed, causing heavy traffic backups between September 9 and 13, two months before Election Day. ""Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee,"" Bridget Anne Kelly, Christie's deputy chief of staff for legislative and intergovernmental affairs, said in an e-mail to David Wildstein, then the highest-level appointee representing the state at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the bridge connecting the two states. ""Got it,"" Wildstein replied. In another message about school buses with students onboard caught in the traffic jams, Wildstein writes, ""they are the children of Buono voters,"" apparently referring to Barbara Buono, Christie's Democratic opponent in last November's gubernatorial election. Those cited in the series of e-mails and text messages did not respond to requests for comment or to verify the communications. Wildstein, who has left his job, is expected to appear at a legislative hearing on Thursday. Read the e-mails . Democratic New Jersey Assembly Deputy Speaker John Wisniewski said the e-mails call into question the integrity of the governor's office. Christie, he said, ""has a lot of explaining to do."" ""I do not believe the governor called the Port Authority and said, 'Close some lanes.' But I did say I hold him responsible for the atmosphere. Now finding that that atmosphere existed in his own office is what I find really troubling,"" Wisniewski said. Christie's name did not appear in the e-mails, he added. Emergency services disrupted . Sokolich told CNN's ""The Situation Room"" the e-mails suggested that political motives behind the lane closures have led him to believe that Christie is more clued-in than he's admitted. ""I'm rooting that the highest elected official in the state of New Jersey isn't involved. But I'm beginning to question my judgment,"" Sokolich said. The mayor raised the issue of public safety being compromised. A letter by his emergency services coordinator, Paul Favia, on September 10 obtained by CNN cited ""new traffic patterns"" around the bridge's toll plaza that were backing up traffic in Fort Lee. ""This new traffic pattern is causing unnecessary delays for emergency services to arrive on scene for medical emergencies,"" Favia said, citing one case in which paramedics rushing to aid an unconscious elderly woman suffering a heart attack were held up and had to meet the ambulance transporting the victim at the hospital instead of at the scene. She later died. Details surrounding the woman's death haven't been released. But the situation could deepen Christie's political woes, Gergen said. ""If a woman died here,"" Gergen said, ""he's in deep, deep trouble."" Other documents raise questions, too . Controversy tarnishes Christie's image -- opinion . Democrats swarm . Christie is now campaigning for fellow GOP governors as chairman of the Republican Governors Association and is seen as prime political target for national Democrats. They rarely attacked him during his re-election campaign but are now becoming more aggressive with the bridge controversy unfolding. ""These revelations are troubling for any public official, but they also indicate what we've come to expect from Governor Christie - when people oppose him, he exacts retribution. When people question him, he belittles and snidely jokes. And when anyone dares to look into his administration, he bullies and attacks,"" said Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the Democratic National Committee chair, in a statement. A source close to Christie said ""there will probably be some sacrificial firing and that'll be it.""

"(CNN) -- Another voice that could have told about the horrors of being a ""comfort woman"" -- a sex slave used by Japanese soldiers during World War II -- has fallen silent, according to South Korean authorities. Hwang Keum-ja, 89, died of lung and respiratory disease at a hospital in Seoul Sunday. Cho Yoon-sun, South Korea's Minister of Gender and Equality and Family, said she had been attempting to meet each of her country's surviving comfort women individually, but had not yet visited Hwang. ""My heart is aching as she died before I was able to meet her,"" she said in a statement, praising Hwang for her efforts to support others despite the hardships she faced, and vowing that her government would deliver greater support to other comfort women. Japan forced about 200,000 women into sex slavery, luring them to ""comfort stations"" set up throughout East Asia by the Japanese military from 1932 until the end of the war, according to nonprofit advocacy group Washington Coalition for Comfort Women Issues. Mostly Korean, the women were lied to and told they would get jobs if they went to the brothels, the center says. CNN has widely reported on the stories of the women. Many have said they were kidnapped. For resisting sex, some say, they were raped and beaten. Hwang Keum-ja was forced to work at a glass factory at 13 and then sent to China to work as a sex slave at 16, South Korea's state news agency Yonhap reported. After Korea was freed from Japanese occupation in 1945, she went home and lived the rest of her life alone, the agency said. She worked as a garbage collector, but didn't make enough, so she had to rely on government subsidies. It's unclear how, but she was able to make three donations to a scholarship fund totaling more than $92,000, which helped earn her an award for her generosity in 2011 in Korea, Yonhap said. Hwang's dying wish was that all her assets be donated to charity. She had one adopted son, according to the ministry. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs states: ""Japan has extended its sincere apologies and remorse to all those women on various occasions such as an apology statement by the Chief Cabinet Secretary Yohei Kono in 1993."" The country has helped establish the Asian Women's Fund in 1995, which is supported by government funds and provides assistance to former comfort women. The South Korean government however does not believe this is enough. Along with the surviving comfort women it is calling for an official government apology, acknowledging legal responsibility for the crimes. Seoul wants Tokyo to provide direct compensation to the victims. But Japan has resisted direct payments to the victims, prompting activists and former comfort women to say leaders are avoiding officially acknowledging what happened. In 2013, the mayor of Osaka, Japan, stirred fierce controversy when he told reporters that ""anyone would understand"" the role of ""comfort women"" when soldiers were risking their lives and deserved a ""rest."" Toru Hashimoto said the use of the women was ""necessary."" Though he acknowledged the issue was a ""tragic result of war,"" Hashimoto insisted that soldiers using the women wasn't unique to Japan. Hashimoto also revealed that he told a U.S. military commander during a trip to a base on the island of Okinawa that U.S. personnel should ""utilize more"" the adult entertainment business in Japan. South Korea has urged Japan to resolve the issue directly with victims, noting that time is running out because most of them are elderly and dying.

"New York (CNN) -- A 16-year-old boy from New Jersey was arrested after allegedly trespassing at 1 World Trade Center, bypassing security and making his way to the 104th floor of the nation's tallest building, police said Thursday. Authorities said Justin Casquejo early Sunday allegedly climbed through a 1-foot opening in a fence surrounding the still-under-construction skyscraper, past ""do not enter"" and ""no trespassing"" signs and, apparently undetected, got to the scaffolding around the building and started climbing. According to the criminal complaint, Casquejo told police, ""I walked around the construction site and figured out how to access the Freedom Tower rooftop. I found a way up through the scaffolding, climbed onto the sixth floor, and took the elevator up to the 88th floor. I then took the staircase up to 104th floor."" On the 104th floor, Casquejo encountered an ""inattentive"" security guard -- a contractor from a security company -- and was able to get past him, according to Joe Pentangelo, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the trade center site. The guard has since been fired, he said. From there, Casquejo told police, he went to the rooftop and climbed a ladder out to the spire of the 1,776-foot building. Around 6 a.m. Sunday, Port Authority police arrested Casquejo on the property, according to Pentangelo. One World Trade Center is rising in the shadows of the original World Trade Center, where the iconic twin towers were felled by two hijacked airplanes on September 11, 2001, in the deadliest terrorist attack on U.S. soil. The criminal complaint said the teen ""knowingly entered and remained unlawfully in a building and upon real property which was fenced and otherwise enclosed in a manner designed to exclude intruders; the defendant knowingly entered and remained unlawfully in and upon premises."" When he was taken into custody, Casquejo had a camera and a phone, Pentangelo said. Warrants have been secured, and the contents of those devices are being checked to establish a motive for Casquejo's alleged trespassing. The investigation continues as authorities review whether Casquejo went anywhere else on the property. ""We take security and these types of infractions very seriously and will prosecute violators,"" Joe Dunne, chief security officer for the Port Authority, said in a statement. ""We continue to reassess our security posture at the site and are constantly working to make this site as secure as possible."" Attempts to reach Casquejo were unsuccessful, but his Twitter page has many photos of himself in various high-altitude locations -- hanging from a crane, standing on a rooftop -- and talks about Parkour, a free-running type exercise that includes obstacle courses, running, climbing and jumping. According to the Manhattan district attorney's office, Casquejo was released without bail after being arraigned on one count of criminal trespass in the third degree, a misdemeanor punished by up to three months in jail, and one count of trespass, a violation punishable by up to 15 days in jail. Pamela Griffith, Casquejo's attorney, declined to comment. One World Trade Center is the United States' tallest building, beating out Chicago's Willis Tower in November. Upon completion, which is expected this year, the skyscraper is expected to rank as the world's third-tallest building, after the Burj Khalifa in Dubai and the Makkah Royal Clock Tower in Mecca, Saudi Arabia.","Justin Casquejo, 16, sneaked past security to the top of 1,776-foot building .

"Dar es Salaam, Tanzania (CNN) -- With hundreds wearing white shirts and hats bearing President Barack Obama's face, Tanzanians said ""karibu,"" or ""welcome,"" to him on Monday as they lined a street temporarily renamed Obama Avenue. Obama is in Africa to promote an increased partnership amid criticism the United States has, outside of military interests, focused its attention on other areas of the world. Tanzania is an important partner on security and development, and Obama sought to highlight its economic potential with China and other foreign governments paying more attention to it lately. Lying strategically on the coast of the Indian Ocean, Tanzania is an outlet for many landlocked neighbors and a jumping-off point for companies looking to expand commercial opportunities. It has largely untapped agricultural and mineral resources, and Obama is trying to put forward the case for African consumers and their governments to look West rather then East. ""We have got enormous opportunity to unleash the next era of African growth. I see Africa as the world's next major economic success story and the United States wants to be a partner in that success,"" Obama told a roundtable of some 20 U.S., African and other international corporate chief executives before addressing a larger group of business leaders. He was joined at the roundtable by the heads of General Electric, Microsoft, Coca-Cola and Symbion Power Corp, which partnered with GE to build a major dam in Tanzania. But is he already too late? China became Africa's largest individual trading partner three years ago, surpassed only by the European Union. Earlier this year, just 10 days after taking office, Chinese President Xi Jinping made Tanzania the first stop on a three-nation Africa tour. He signed 16 trade, cultural and diplomatic accords in Tanzania alone. According to the local arm of the China-Africa business council, there are approximately 8,000 Chinese owned businesses operating in Tanzania, ranging from large-scale construction projects to small shops and market kiosks. And more Chinese citizens are flocking to seek their fortunes across Africa. ""Everyone knows that China is the factory of the world. All the big countries, including the U.S., have their factories there,"" said Hao Jianguo of the China-Africa Business Council, noting that the import-export pipeline is direct and prices favorable. ""Where there's an opportunity for business, the businessmen find it. Our motto is, 'Follow the profit,'"" Jianguo said. Still, Obama promoted sound business practices and his own initiatives, the previously announced Power Africa, aimed at improving the continent's power grid and the recently announced Trade Africa. The latter is a partnership between the United States and African nations intended to expand trade with countries including Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda. Trade Africa aims to double intra-regional trade in East African Community (EAC) countries and boost exports to the United States by 40%. On Monday, the president also said his commerce secretary and other U.S. officials would visit Africa on trade missions to make good on his promises. ""I'm making this trip early in my second term, because I intend for this to be the beginning of a new level of economic engagement with Africa,"" Obama said. ""If people across this continent are just given a chance, if they're just empowered with the skills and the resources and the capital ... they can achieve extraordinary progress."" Obama will visit Symbion on Tuesday, continuing a theme of the trip during which he has pledged an additional $7 billion to increase power infrastructure across the continent. Obama's visit to Africa's biggest economy was part of a three-nation trip that began last week and included stops in Senegal, South Africa and Tanzania. Celebratory greeting . Prior to his meeting with business leaders, Obama and Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete spoke and answered questions before the vast building adorned with American and Tanzanian flags on grounds complete with peacocks. The respect between the two leaders, as well as the appreciation Kikwete has for the United States was clear. ""The people of Tanzania love you,"" Kikwete said, looking at Obama. ""There has never been a visit by a head of state to Tanzania that has attracted such big crowds."" Kikwete was the first African leader Obama welcomed to the White House, a sign of the shared interests between the countries, Obama said. He noted their cooperation over health care, infrastructure, energy and job creation. ""Africa needs the United States, the United States needs Africa,"" Kikwete said. At the State House in Tanzania there was a celebratory greeting for the president and first lady Michelle Obama with a band, dancers and a mass of applauding, whooping crowds lining the red carpet as the Obamas shook hands making their way to the whitewashed building.

"(CNN) -- The family of Jeffrey Edward Fowle, an American tourist detained in North Korea for apparently breaking an unspecified law, has apologized to the reclusive state and asked for his release. Fowle's wife and their three children appeared at a news conference in Lebanon, Ohio, Tuesday, in which the family's lawyer, Timothy Tepe read a statement. ""The family would like to express its heartfelt apology to the people and the government of the DPRK (Democratic People's Republic of Korea). Jeff has apologized publicly for his actions and Jeffrey's family petitions the government of the DPRK for mercy toward Jeffrey and asks for his release."" Fowle's family has been writing to U.S. President Barack Obama and previous presidents including George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter to help his case. In previous cases of arrested Americans in North Korea, visits by U.S. former heads of state helped secure their return. Carter visited Pyongyang in 2010 to free American Aijalon Mahli Gomes and Clinton also made the trip to free U.S. journalists Laura Ling and Euna Lee in 2009. ""The next few days are critical as we approach the trial date,"" Tepe said at the news conference, attended by CNN affiliate based in Dayton, Ohio, WHIO. There was no official announcement of a trial date from North Korea's state-run, Korean Central News Agency (KCNA). Plea for help . Earlier this month, the Associated Press, which has a bureau in Pyongyang, was granted an interview with Fowle and another American held in the country. In the interview released on August 1, Fowle told the wires service, that ""the window is closing on that process. It will be coming relatively soon, maybe within a month,"" Fowle said of his trial. In the interview, Fowle apologized to both the United States and North Korea. He also wrote a letter, in which it stated: ""I intentionally left a Bible in a nightclub."" He wrote that he had been treated well, but it was unclear whether the statement was written freely or whether he was pressured. Tepe said the family has received one phone call and one letter from him in North Korea. ""They're desperate for his release and his return home. As you can imagine, Jeffrey is the primary financial provider for his family and [his wife] Tatyana is struggling to manage by herself,"" Tepe said at Tuesday's news conference. Three Americans in custody . In June, KCNA reported that authorities were investigating Fowle, whom it said violated the law by acting ""contrary to the purpose of tourism."" Citing unidentified sources, Japanese news agency Kyodo reported that Fowle was part of a tour group and that he was detained in mid-May after allegedly leaving a Bible behind. In a previous statement, the family had said,""Jeffrey loves to travel and loves the adventure of experiencing different cultures and seeing new places."" Fowle is one of three Americans detained in North Korea, including Matthew Todd Miller, who was taken into custody on April 10, according to KCNA and Korean-American missionary, Kenneth Bae, who has been sentenced to 15 years hard labor in 2013.","Jeffrey Fowle visited North Korea as part of a tour group earlier this year .

"(CNN) -- Anita Mills was sitting in the doctor's office with her diabetic mother in Lexington, Kentucky, in 2009. ""The doctor was talking to her about options and she wanted to try all of them to stay alive,"" says Mills. ""I realized how brave she was, trying to keep her life. I was 382 pounds and killing myself."" She cried in the bathroom of the doctor's office, returned home and took a picture of herself. (The image shown above.) This was a first day of the rest of her life. ""I was finally ready and determined. Taking that first picture was my way of making me accountable to this choice to start this journey,"" says Mills. ""I wanted to have it on my phone to look at every day, especially when I was having not a great day."" Mills has been overweight for as long as she can remember. She recalls ""plumping up"" at 5 years old and weighing 200 pounds in junior high. ""My family doctor said I needed to get the weight off and if I didn't, I was going to shorten my life,"" says Mills. ""He gave me a piece of paper with four tips to lose weight."" Have your own weight loss story to share? Visit iReport.com . Before the epiphany, she kept that piece of paper in her purse for months, even when she would change purses. And every time, she would look at it and think, ""I'll start tomorrow."" Tomorrow finally came on August 17, 2009. After snapping that photo, Mills went into her purse and pulled out the tips the doctor had given her: . 1. Eat 8 ounces of food every 3 hours . 2. No sugary drinks . 3. Do not skip meals . 4. Do not tell anyone what you're doing . So that's what she did -- or didn't do, really. Almost two years later, Mills has dropped 232 pounds from her body and has trimmed her waist down to 26 inches (a size 6). And she did it all without a trainer. ""I've always walked, no matter how hard it was,"" says Mills. ""Then I used Richard Simmons' 'Sweating to the Oldies' because it's low-impact. Now I Zumba, which is like Richard Simmons on speed."" She doesn't go crazy with her workouts. She walks about five times a week, sweats to Simmons twice a week and fits Zumba in when she can. Mills can't even eat a full 8 ounces of food anymore -- her stomach has gotten so small -- and she needs to be very picky about what she eats. Her body craves the ""good food,"" so she listens to it. Her latest cravings have been fresh pineapples and mandarin oranges. Don't think that she's a saint either. She still enjoys temptations ... within reason. ""I still go out to eat and I still eat junk,"" says Mills. ""My guilty pleasure for the last 8 months [has been] Breyers fat free ice cream -- half cup a night."" When she goes out to eat, she orders a meal -- anything she wants -- and asks for a to-go box. It helps with eating healthy food portions, even if she's noshing on her favorite meal: fried chicken fingers and deep fried potato chips. ""Out of sight, out of mind,"" says Mills. ""I don't get sick any more from eating too much. You just need to know portion control. I'm accountable for what I put in my body."" The hardest thing for Mills was pushing through her plateaus. ""I would lose [weight] for about seven days and then nothing for about 10 to 15 days, which was the hardest,"" she says. But since losing hundreds of pounds, Mills has appeared on the ""Rachael Ray Show"" for a makeover and talks regularly in schools. ""I tell the kids this doesn't just mean weight loss; if you put your mind to anything, nothing can stop you,"" says Mills. ""If you think, 'This is what I'm going to do,' you can get anything done."" Mills gives all her credit to her supportive family, especially her husband, Charlie, whom she has been married to for nearly 25 years. She remembers him saying, ""I loved her at 382 and I love her now. I love her no matter what. She may look a little different, but she's the same girl."" As a family, they are all living healthier lives and dropping the pounds together. But most importantly, Mills wants to be around to take care of her husband, 23- and 19-year-old sons, and elderly parents for as long as she can. And she loves every minute of her hectic, thinner life. ""The one thing I can do that I couldn't before is that I can cross my legs and get up and down off the floor,"" says Mills. She is trying new things that she never thought were possible. She and her husband are going to Gatlinburg, Tennessee, and hopping on a zip line. Mills is also thinking about skydiving sometime in the future. One more thing on her to do list: Ride a roller coaster at Dollywood in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, which she hasn't been about to do since she was about 8 years old because of her size. ""I have a whole new life,"" says Mills. ""It's fabulous to get to this point.""","Anita Mills lost 232 pounds .

"London (CNN) -- Venezuelan pianist Gabriela Montero dedicated part of a London concert to those confronting the government in Venezuela, saying she felt ""our sadness, our impotence, our frustration"". Fighting back tears, the 40-year-old virtuoso, who is a noted critic of the collectivist policies of President Nicolas Maduro and his predecessor Hugo Chavez, improvised a piano piece which she said was her interpretation of the struggle in Venezuela of anti-government activists. ""When I improvise, people understand, people feel the pain that we feel,"" she told her audience at the Queen Elizabeth Hall of the Royal Festival Hall in London on Wednesday. The audience was mainly English but dotted with Venezuelan flags and a smattering of her compatriots in caps and T-shirts in the starred yellow, blue and red colors of the Venezuelan flag. Clearly moved by the presence of Venezuelans, she said: ""To see the Venezuelans here, to see the flags, just killed me."" Born in Caracas to an American mother and a Venezuelan father, Montero was a child prodigy and is a star on the world concert tour. She played at the inauguration of President Barack Obama in 2009 and now lives in the U.S. During a break in her concert, after taking requests from the audience and improvising on them, Montero told the audience Venezuela was facing a ""very, very critical time"". It was ""one of our great tragedies"" she said, adding that few outside the country understood what was going on in Venezuela. She referenced a high murder rate and, to applause, mourned what she called ""the loss of our country to violence, to corruption and to the worst possible things you can imagine."" Montero has been outspoken in her support for those who have challenged the government in Venezuela and has deplored the state of the country and the crackdown on protesters. Last month she criticized another famous Venezuelan music star, conductor Gustavo Dudamel of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, and younger conductor Christian Vazquez for performing in Venezuela while the protests raged on the streets. ""They played a concert while their people were being massacred,"" she said in an open letter. Dudamel responded by saying he condemned the violence and his music represented the ""universal language of peace"".","Pianist Gabriela Montero tells a London concert how Venezuela is being lost to violence and corruption .

"London, England (CNN) -- Under constant scrutiny, hosting countless functions and attending numerous public events are just some of the practices expected of you as the wife of a prime minister. All the while conducting yourself impeccably. So when Tony Blair was elected British prime minister in 1997, Cherie Blair went from being a fairly obscure but accomplished barrister to the spouse of the country's political leader. ""You go in there and you kind of think you can just carry on as before,"" she says. ""Suddenly I couldn't just speak for myself ... as the wife of the prime minister I'm supposed to be seen and not heard. But she was never going to be a traditional political trophy wife smiling quietly in the background. A humble upbringing . Moving the family into England's most famous political address was worlds away from how Cherie herself was brought up in a working class household in 1960s Liverpool. The eldest of two daughters, Cherie Booth -- her maiden name, which she continues to use in her professional life -- came from a tumultuous family background. Both parents were actors but she describes her father Tony -- a minor sitcom star -- as ""flawed"", recalling how he left the family when she was 8 years old. As it turned out, Booth had an aptitude for academics along with a hardworking nature instilled through her upbringing by a ""formidable"" mother and grandmother. She went on to read law at the London School of Economics graduating with first-class honors and emerging as the top law student in her class when she sat the bar exams. She continued to excel during her apprenticeship with prestigious attorney Derry Irvine. And it was there she met another advocate undergoing ""pupilage"" by the name of Anthony Blair. ""He didn't make a good impression on me at the time,"" she says. ""I thought he's just another one of these public school boys but then we worked together and ... he made a different impression on me."" Ever the astute young lawyer she also noted how her gender was considered an impediment when she went up against her future husband for a position at Lincoln's Inn -- one of the four Inns of Court in London. Tony got the job. She says it was because they assumed ""I am a female, I'm bound to leave when I had children. ""In fact seven years later one of us did leave the bar but it wasn't me. It was my husband because he left to become an MP (Member of Parliament)."" A profound union . As her spouse rose in the political ranks, Booth carved out a successful career first as an attorney then, in 1995, she received the senior advocate status of Queen's Counsel. Six years later she turned her attention to co-founding her own practice, Matrix . Juggling work and home life hasn't always been easy for the high profile pairing. Blair cites her strong alliance with her partner as a key to her success. ""There were plenty of times when he would be the person who was there up with the children in [our] constituency when I was in court somewhere,"" she says. ""He was very supportive and always has been he's been a very hands-on father."" This hands on, compromising approach to raising their children is the reason Blair doesn't believe the idea of work-life balance is solely a women's issue. ""The way we do things at the moment doesn't just disadvantage women. I think it disadvantages men and doesn't allow them to explore the caring side of their personalities."" Combining advocacy and humanitarian work . Blair says her 10 years at Downing Street helped provide a renewed purpose when it came to championing the rights of women around the world. ""So much of the oppression of women is based on some sort of fear about the power of females ... We all know actually men and women flourish best when they're both given the opportunities to reach their dreams,"" says Blair. In 2008 she established the Cherie Blair Foundation for Women with the purpose of providing education and capital to female entrepreneurs in developing and emerging nations. Projects have been launched in locations including Ghana, Tanzania and Rwanda where the foundation works with local women providing the necessary tools and technological support to take their businesses to the next level. ""The reason why I wanted to help women is obvious -- because of my own background ... I had the opportunities that my mother and my grandmother would only -- well did -- dream of,"" explains Blair. ""As I get older, I get more impatient, because we haven't yet succeeded making it possible for women to achieve their dreams. We still have not got gender equality anywhere. ""In this world I am afraid money talks, and the woman who has her own money, who has financial independence, can make decisions, she can make choices ... They will also change the lives of those around them, and ultimately, shape society for the better."" So what kind of legacy would Blair like to leave behind? ""I think on my gravestone, I'd like it to say 'Cherie Blair, wife, mother and feminist'.""","Cherie Blair is best known as the wife of former British PM Tony Blair .

"(CNN) -- Around the country on Friday, you'll likely see the iconic black and white POW-MIA flag flying over federal buildings. At military bases, there will be ceremonies with troops in dress uniforms marching and leaders speaking. At the Pentagon, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta will oversee a ceremony that will conclude with a flyover by warplanes and helicopters in honor of the 83,000 known service members still listed as prisoners of war or missing in action. But not every remembrance of those Americans will include such pomp and activity. If you were to walk through the mess hall of a Navy ship or an Army installation, you might see a small table covered in a simple cloth. One chair sits in front of a single formal place setting. On the plate, salt and a slice of lemon. Next to the plate, a glass vase containing a red rose with a red ribbon around the base. This silent tribute is full of symbolism. The table is round ""to show our everlasting concern"" according to the National League of POW/MIA Families website. The cloth is white, ""symbolizing the purity of their motives when answering the call to duty."" The rose reminds ""us of the lives of these men ... and their loved ones and friends who keep the faith, while seeking answers."" The red ribbon ""symbolizes our continued determination to account for them."" The slice of lemon ""reminds us of the bitter fate of those captured and missing in a foreign land."" The salt ""symbolizes the tears of our missing and their families who long for answers after decades of uncertainty."" A Bible represents the ""strength gained through faith in our country, founded as one nation under God, to sustain those lost from our midst."" A glass is inverted on the table ""to symbolize their inability to share this evening's toast."" Finally, there is the empty chair, with that obvious symbolism. At larger events where POW/MIA groups gather, a similar table will be set, but with identical place settings, one for each of the armed forces, including the Coast Guard, and a sixth for civilians still missing. Pam Cain, secretary of the League of POW/MIA Families, said when an explanation is read of what each item symbolizes, she ""can barely get through it to the end."" Cain's father, Col. Oscar Mauterer, disappeared after bailing out from his burning plane during a mission over Laos in 1966. She said the POW/MIA table is an important, if not well known, part of her organization's efforts to remember the missing. Friday night, as you sit down for dinner, look at the salt or perhaps the chair with a loved one next to you and remember there are those still waiting for a loved one to come home.","Some 83,000 Americans are listed as prisoners of war or missing in action .

"(CNN) -- Back in 2005, the future didn't look too bright for Rosebill Satha-Sambo. Just over 20 years old, the young Malawian fell onto hard times after losing her job. Penniless and out of work, she'd found herself having to raise two baby daughters with no income coming in. To survive, Satha-Sambo resorted to a skill she'd learned from her mother while growing up: weaving bamboo baskets. Working from her home in the Malawian capital of Lilongwe, she began producing elaborate hampers for friends who were about to get married. Orders soon started piling in and, as business picked up, her creations quickly became the talk of the town -- including in high circles. ""My baskets caught the eye of the late president Bingu Wa Mutharika's daughter, Duwa, who was getting married,"" recalls Satha-Sambo. ""She ordered 1,000 wedding favor baskets that she needed in three weeks -- there was no way I could have done it myself, so I got some youth and women who I knew could weave and together [we] fulfilled the order."" That was in 2009 and by 2011 Satha-Sambo had set up JARDS Products, a thriving social enterprise focused on producing a wide range of eco-friendly bamboo furniture and baskets -- from beautiful rocking chairs and mirror frames to hand-made dressing tables and storage units. ""JARDS is an acronym for my family,"" says Satha-Sambo. ""[Daughters] Joanna, Amanda, Rosebill, Dalitsa, who's my husband, and Sambo, which is our surname,"" she adds. ""JARDS is all about family, community and friends, that's who we are."" Tackling youth unemployment . Malawi is a beautiful landlocked country in southeastern Africa. It is known as the ""warm heart"" of the continent for its spectacular scenery and friendly people. Yet, it is also one of Africa's poorest nations with chronically high unemployment rates, especially amongst young people. ""For the past 20 years, those who used to live in the rural areas left for the 'greener pastures' of the life in the city,"" says Satha-Sambo. ""But they end up becoming domestic workers or guards and their children look after each other and sometimes can't stay in school and the vicious life cycle continues."" Read this: Luxury shoes put sparkle in your step . Influenced by her mother, who'd spent years going to rural areas to teach groups of disadvantaged women how to weave bamboo baskets and furniture, Satha-Sambo also started training young people in her community to help them better their lives. ""I know how it feels to be unemployed, with a family relying on you to provide for basic necessities,"" says the 30-year-old entrepreneur. ""Instead of them doing nothing at home, let them learn a skill that can basically end up being their income generator,"" she says. ""It is important because unemployment in my country is so high; we need to break the cycle of poverty that causes gender-based violence, child marriages and prostitution."" Remarkable turnaround . To achieve this, Satha-Sambo works with uneducated women and young people who can't get into university. ""We've got people who come in who want to train how to make earrings,"" she says. ""We've got people who come in who want to know how to carve wooden products."" And when she's not training young people, nor running JARDS, nor mentoring budding entrepreneurs -- not to mention raising her family -- Satha-Sambo manages to find time to attend the Malawi Institute of Management. ""I have a good job and what is considered a thriving business but this is something I want to achieve for myself,"" says Satha-Sambo, who is currently finishing her business degree and plans to start a Master's straight after. ""I also want to show my daughters, nieces and girls in my community the importance of education -- it opens up your mind and gets you thinking in a different way."" It's been a remarkable turnaround for Satha-Sambo, whose business acumen and social focus has recently won her two international grants, as well as four Malawian and foreign awards. With a growing business and big plans for the years ahead, the future now looks much brighter for this determined entrepreneur with a social conscience. ""I actually want to set up a skills-development center because I think entrepreneurship is the way for Africa to go,"" she says. ""These skills just need to be passed ... because the jobs need to be created -- and how do you create a job if you don't actually have the papers, and you don't have a skill? So that's where we're headed."" Read this: Luxury shoes put sparkle in your step . Read this: How to turn trash into cash .

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- On a warm, late summer evening, Nas Scott readies himself atop patchy grass and waits. At the sound of his coach's whistle, the 12-year-old charges a tee, kicking a football and dirt into the setting sun. Despite the less-than-desirable field conditions, Scott and his fellow teammates from the North Philadelphia Aztecs are fired up. They're excited because the youth football program is getting a much-needed boost from a local hero. The Aztecs practice on a field at the center of Hunting Park in the heart of North Philadelphia. Instead of playing on gridiron befitting of national champions, their home field is a dust bowl -- and sometimes a lake, depending on the weather. The field is in such poor condition they haven't hosted a home game in 19 years. ""I feel very upset because we have to go to a high school and we can't just play here,"" said eighth-grader John Paul, 13. But this week, the Aztecs -- the first inner-city youth football team to win a Pop Warner championship -- got word they're getting a new field, compliments of Philadelphia Eagles' quarterback Michael Vick. On Tuesday, the newly formed Team Vick Foundation announced that its first major gift totaling $200,000 goes to the Aztecs for a new field. Vick, who spent about 18 months in federal prison after pleading guilty to dogfighting charges in 2007, said the donation is a gift to the City of Brotherly Love for embracing him after the Eagles signed him following his release from prison. ""It's important because the kids mean a lot, I think, and the Philadelphia community deserves that. When I first got here they embraced me and it's something that I'll never forget,"" Vick said. The former Atlanta Falcons player got his start in football growing up in Virginia. Although watching the Aztecs play brings back memories for the football giant, Vick said he wants them to learn from his mistakes. ""Do everything that you can, you know, to stay on the right path. That's where it all starts. Other than that, football is obsolete; it doesn't matter,"" he said. ""You are what you eat ... and they have to understand that perception is just as big as reality."" The new football field is the capstone project for the $4 million revitalization effort led by the Fairmount Park Conservancy, a small but mighty nonprofit working to improve the city's vast park system. Other sport legends signed on to help the troubled Hunting Park, including the Phillies' Ryan Howard and tennis great Billie Jean King. Since renovations began, the park has seen a new baseball field, tennis courts, playgrounds and a community garden complete with farmer's market. ""It has literally been a coalition of champions, an army of champions if you will, who are helping to lift this project up and make it successful,"" said Kathryn Ott Lovell, executive director of Fairmount Park Conservancy. ""This park became a real liability. People avoided it at all costs."" Once part of the estate of James Logan, who was state founder William Penn's secretary, the 87-acre Hunting Park went from a destination point in the 1940s and '50s to a place riddled with crime and drugs. Things got so bad one city official was skeptical of a turnaround. ""My skepticism, not my participation, but my skepticism was blown out of the water early on. I think this is one of the most remarkable comebacks in my 30 years of public service that I've seen anywhere,"" said Michael DiBerardinis, commissioner of Philadelphia Parks & Recreation. ""(Michael Vick's) attraction to the neighborhood really says a lot about who he is, what he cares about and how he views himself in the world."" At Hunting Park, the Aztecs use football as a positive outlet for youth hailing from some of the city's toughest neighborhoods, something head coach Jeremiah Berry said he wants to last. Berry, who played football growing up and even played on the same field in Hunting Park, said the Aztecs program went from three teams in 1994 to eight teams today, serving close to 400 young people from ages 5 to 15. ""I've seen some good kids come, I have seen some kids that are no longer with us and some kids get caught up in the wrong things,"" Berry said. ""The park gets a second chance, the kids get a second chance and Michael Vick got a second chance. So, it's meant to be, a match made in heaven.""","The home field of the North Philadelphia Aztecs is in disrepair .

"Olympic Park, London (CNN) -- The face of the Olympics is well known the world over: athletes winning, losing, straining every sinew of their bodies in the pursuit of podium glory. But behind the scenes there is another story of the athletes' lives and the use of their bodies, one that centers on their time staying at the Olympic Village. ""Anyone who wants to be naive and say they don't know what's going on in the Village are lying to themselves,"" one former gold medalist and veteran of two Olympics told CNN of his previous experiences at the Games. ""They know, the officials know, even the media. It's not a secret, everyone knows! ""(Sex) is all part of the Olympic spirit. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) wouldn't say that, but it is, you can't shy away from it. Why do you think they give away so many condoms?"" The Athletes' Village at the Olympic Games is a unique environment: Nearly 3,000 tightly packed apartments, containing over 10,000 of the world's finest athletes who have traveled from more than 200 countries around the world to stay for a two-week sporting jamboree. A potent mix of fit, body beautiful, young people -- many of whom have abstained from sexual intercourse as part of a disciplined training regime -- being in the same place, at the same time; cocooned from the outside world by tight security and often reveling in the glory of success and attention of devoted crowds and the world's press. Olympics live blog . It is maybe only human nature that people, when placed together, procreate to some extent, but that libidinous cocktail means London 2012 officials were right if the experiences of Sydney and Atlanta were anything to make 150,000 condoms -- a record for the modern Games -- available to the Village's frisky inhabitants, according to CNN's source . ""The athletes don't know what to expect the first time they go to the Olympics, but it just happens,"" added the former gold medalist, who is now approaching his late 30s, looking back at his Olympic experiences. ""As soon as you finish competing there's no sleeping until the next day! ""Many of the volunteers (in the Village) would say 'Oh, what is your room like?' and I knew they were not really wanting to see the room. It's just fun, they are excited to be with the athletes. ""You talk, you go to your room. Let me say this ... there were lots of volunteers and they were happy to help you with whatever your needs were. ""My roommate and I would put something on the door so we would know if the other was 'busy'. I feel bad to say it but my coach actually guarded the door the night before me and my roommate were racing (because of our reputations)! But it didn't affect me like that. When I raced after sex I felt light on my feet. ""We were young and most of the people I hung out with were single. Hope Solo told it basically like it is,"" said the runner, referring to the U.S. female soccer team goalkeeper. Solo is one of the few current athletes to have been candid about her experience of the Village environment. ""There's a lot of sex going on,"" said the 30-year-old keeper In an interview with ESPN Magazine, prior to the London Games. ""With a once-in-a-lifetime experience, you want to build memories, whether it's sexual, partying or on the field. I've seen people having sex right out in the open. On the grass, between buildings, people are getting down and dirty."" The anonymous runner who spoke to CNN, said that he found himself in the exact situation Solo had described, despite the surveillance of airborne security at the Village employed after a bomb exploded at the Atlanta Games in 1996. ""It was around one in the morning and security wouldn't let us out of the Village, so me and my roommate went to the cafeteria for something to eat. The girls in there said, 'Oh, we finish in an hour, what are you guys doing?' So we said 'We're heading back to our room'. They asked if they could walk with us, and all I will say is we didn't make it back to the room -- and this with the helicopters flying over with their searchlights! It was OK, we were under trees."" Shenanigans that would conceivably come as no surprise to swimmer Ryan Lochte and winner of five medals in the London pool. ""Seventy to 75 percent of Olympians hook up behind the scenes,"" the 27-year-old swimmer told ESPN in July. ""Hey, sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do."" Solo believes the friendly nature of the Games makes it easy to meet people. ""Unlike at a bar, it's not awkward to strike up a conversation because you have something in common,"" Solo told ESPN. ""It starts with, 'What sport do you play?' All of a sudden, you're fist-bumping."" ""Sydney was the best, they were so welcoming, friendly and passionate,"" said CNN's anonymous athlete, referring to the 2000 Games. ""In Sydney it was like going back to your school reunion and seeing people you haven't seen for a few years. Athletes from the Bahamas, Jamaica, friends that you keep with on the circuit all excited about being there. The Olympic spirit somehow touches everyone. ""In the Village you have an official masseuse and I was having problems with my leg after my race. So I went to the medical center which ultimately led to me having a rub down and I remember the very pretty lady who was going to treat me. She said: 'Please take off your clothes' and then she said 'Oh my God, look at your body, I've never seen a body like this!' So she helped with the rub down and afterwards I knew something was going to happen, and it did."" Olympic athletes' extreme eating habits . However, it is not just the sexually-charged nature of the Athletes' Village that makes it such unique accommodation. According to former 100-meter men's champion Linford Christie, the Village offers a unique opportunity to spend time, and often to make friends, with other athletes and even rivals. ""I loved staying in the Village, when I was Team GB captain I encouraged people to stay there because how on earth will the young athletes develop if all the experienced stars stay away? It's a way to take your mind of the pressure of your event,"" said Christie, who is working with CNN during the Olympics. ""In 1992 there was the basketball 'Dream Team' and you see Michael Jordan walking around in the cafeteria -- it was like 'woooh!' You look up to him, firstly, because he was seven foot but also because he was a big star. I collected autographs in there, for other people. ""And in track and field the people that you compete against are often your good friends. I met Frankie Fredericks that way. I've got a good friend who was a German handball player and have friends from swimming as well as track and field. I met people through sport that I would never have met otherwise."" The Village also creates an environment in which national teams can bond. ""I think it's very positive, because it's a shared experience and it's a leveler,"" said Christie. ""Sometimes the food was bad, but if I performed as team captain and I'd eaten the same food then that was a message for the team: it was no excuse. It's fun, you can hang out with superstars and you get a chance to talk to people instead of being cocooned in a hotel on your own somewhere."" Kriss Akabusi, a veteran of the Los Angeles and Barcelona Games, also felt staying at the Village was a vital part of the Olympic experience. ""You know you've arrived when you get to the Village. The best of the best are there and everything is available for your needs,"" he said. ""I'm quite an insular person, self-centered even, and the Athletes' Village was good for my preparation because everything there is about 'you'. You can decide whether or not you want to speak to the press or not. If you have a niggle then there's a doctor, physio, all there ready to go,"" the 400-meter runner and hurdler told CNN. ""L.A. had the best facilities. We could e-mail and get information straightaway as it was the beginning of Internet facilities. They had 24/7 movies, great food and it was my first time in America, Hollywood! It was phenomenal Games. ""For 17 days we were the center of the universe. And if people were getting jiggy that's fine but that wasn't my experience or a lot of other athletes.""","London 2012 distributed 150, 000 condoms to athletes .

"(CNN) -- Not long ago camel milk was an unfancied staple, the preserve of Bedouin herders. However companies in the UAE have recently been positioning camel products as the stuff of luxury. Upscale department stores like London's Selfridge's now stock camel milk chocolate and it might not be long before camel milk ice cream, cheese, hot dogs -- and even camel leather handbags -- follow suit. ""Currently, we are exporting our camel milk to Kuwait, Jordan, Malaysia, Austria and the UK, with quite positive outcomes,"" says Mustasher Al Badry, the deputy general manager at Camelicious, one of the UAE's camel milk producers, and a brand owned by the Emirates Industry for Camel Milk & Products (EICMP). In the last few years, Camelicious' product line has exploded. They recently launched the world's first camel milk cheese, and their herd of camels has grown from a few hundred in 2006 to 4,200 as of today. Their sister company, Al Nassma, Dubai's own luxury brand of camel milk chocolate, recently developed camel milk gelato. ""We are pioneers in our field and pretty much anything we do is a 'first-time-ever,'"" says Al Badry. Other brands have started to capitalize on local camel-mania. Dubai coffee shop Cafe2Go made international headlines with its ""camelccinos"" and camel lattes, Italian style drinks made with camel milk. Camel meat also features prominently on the menu, which serves up camel fajitas, hot dogs, burgers and salami. Cafe2Go founder Jassim Al Bastaki also created a sub-brand called Camellos, which will stock Dubai's supermarkets with camel retail products, including meat (an industry first). ""I said, OK, let's go global with a camel revolution, and we'll enter as a pioneer of the camel cafÃ©,"" says Al Bastaki, who has franchised versions of Cafe2Go in Pakistan, Libya, Kenya, Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Over the hump . Camel is not the easiest product to work with. As a meat, it tends to be lean and tough -- not the most amenable for hot dogs and burgers. The milk is also half the fat of cow's milk -- a quality that makes it ideal for the health conscious but less so when you're concocting a recipe for chocolate. ""It's not easy for chocolate producers, because the fat does affect the taste,"" admits Martin Van Almsick, Al Nassma's general manager. ""We did a lot of trial and error in product development. We have really good, very experienced chocolate makers and without them we wouldn't have been able to overcome it, but we're over that hurdle."" Al Bastaki noted he had similar obstacles when crafting recipes from camel meat. In the end, he decided to mix the meat with fat from the hump to even out the consistency. Advocates of camel milk tend to cite its many health properties. Al Badry points out that camel milk is not only lower in fat than cow's milk, it's three- to five-times higher in vitamin C and easier to digest -- making it a suitable replacement for the lactose intolerant. This, he notes, is one reason the product has soared in popularity. The advent of camel products was given a boost last year when the European Union agreed to accept camel milk imports from the UAE (meat is still pending). Since then, Cameliscious has expanded its reach considerably. ""Camel milk is a product that is widely unknown in the markets we are aiming to enter, but awareness is steadily increasing,"" says Al Badry. ""We are very optimistic that our milk will convince through quality and health benefits. We are paving the way.""","Camel milk and meat products have become trendy in the UAE .
Shops sell everything from camel hotdogs to camel milk gelato .
Camel products are going global; the EU allowed for camel milk trade last year ."

""She is traveling in her yacht, Guppy, with her father until Lisbon where she will start the official solo sailing trip around the world."" Dekker's attempt to circle the globe hasn't always been smooth sailing. Last August, Dutch authorities placed Dekker under state care for two months after her parents refused to prevent her from undertaking the potentially dangerous voyage. Last October, a Dutch court ruled against letting Dekker sail solo around the world, saying she is not experienced enough to make the trip on her own. However, she would be allowed to travel this year if she fulfilled certain requirements the court established for her to sail.

"(CNN) -- Ever since his blistering debut as an angry, disenfranchised ghetto kid in ""La Haine"", Vincent Cassel has gained a reputation for giving the kind of performances it's hard to ignore. Cassel has won plaudits for his virtuoso turn as a French gangster in the movie ""Mesrine."" Angular and athletic with a menacing pout and searing blue eyes, the French actor has made his name playing hard-edged, morally compromised, often unlikeable characters. Away from the onscreen bad boys, he's one half of France's most glamorous screen couple. His wife, the Italian actress Monica Belluci is a big name in her own right, and has starred in the last two films of the ""Matrix"" trilogy as well as acting alongside Cassel in a number of movies. A huge star at home, Cassel has enjoyed critical success abroad with roles in films like ""Eastern Promises"", David Cronenburg's 2007 tale about the Russian mafia in London, and is one of only a handful of French male stars to get parts in Hollywood. He has enjoyed cameos in ""Ocean's Twelve"" and ""Ocean's Thirteen"" as well as voicing the character of Monsieur Hood in the ""Shrek"" cartoon. That said he's yet to score a real Hollywood hit in his own right. The moment for that may not be far away, especially after his recent virtuoso turn in the French blockbuster ""Mesrine"". In the film he plays the real-life French gangster Jacques Mesrine. His performance helped make the film a huge hit in France and netted him a best actor César, the French equivalent of the Oscars. ""(Cassel) is viewed in France as a very good actor with charisma and intelligence,"" Agnes Poirier, a London-based French film critic told CNN. ""Like most intelligent actors, he's politically aware and doesn't mince his words."" France's most wanted criminal in the seventies, Mesrine is a controversial figure in his native land. A charismatic and psychotic criminal, he courted the press and was known for daring bank heists and prison breaks. He was eventually gunned down by police on the streets of Paris in 1979. The two-part movie --released in the UK and the U.S. this month -- is the perfect showcase for Cassel's muscular brand of acting and pairs him up with the grand old master of French cinema, Gerard Depardieu, who plays the head of Mesrine's band of hoodlums in the film. ""He's not yet seen on a par with Depardieu,"" said Poirier. ""Not being of a classic beauty, Cassel belongs to the ""gueules cassées"" (which literally means ""broken faces"") such as Jean-Paul Belmondo before him. It's French gallic charm with character."" Cassel's first movie role was in ""La Haine"" (or ""Hate"" in English) the 1995 indie hit about a group of youths living on a Paris housing estate. Directed by ""Amelie"" star Matthieu Kassovitz, the film stirred controversy because of its stark depiction of racial tensions. In it Cassel plays an angry young boxer with a Robert De Niro obsession. The middle-class son of the popular film actor Jean-Pierre Cassel, he was not an obvious choice to play the part of a disenfranchised street kid. Even so, he made the part his own and still maintains the movie is one of his proudest moments. ""I love that ""La Haine"" is still so accurate, but that also horrifies me,"" Cassel told London's Observer newspaper in an interview earlier this year. He told the paper that he didn't think France was a racist place but that the country still had ""many problems with our immigrant past."" The 42-year-old Parisian didn't rest on his laurels following ""La Haine."" He made a string of hard-hitting films, the most controversial of which by far was the 2002 movie ""Irréversible."" The film is told backwards and features an excruciating 10-minute rape scene in which Belluci, his wife, plays the victim. In spite of the raw subject matter, the experience of filming with his wife on ""Irréversible"" is something Cassel clearly enjoyed since the two have appeared with each other in eight other movies. The golden couple of the Gallic movie scene have a daughter together but France's strict privacy laws mean they're afforded a degree of freedom not always permitted to their Hollywood counterparts. ""The French press is famously respectful of personalities' private lives especially if those celebrities don't play with the fire of self-seeking publicity,"" said Poirier. ""Mesrine: Killer Instinct"" is in UK cinemas now. ""Mesrine: Public Enemy No.1"" is in UK cinemas 28 August .","In his latest role Vincent Cassel plays a famous French gangster .

"(CNN) -- Commentators who have watched the conflict in Northern Ireland play out for decades call the peace process a miracle. Various leaders negotiated for years to bring an end to Northern Ireland's ""troubles."" Culminating in a power sharing deal between Ulster's unionists, led by Ian Paisley, and Sinn Fein, the political arm of the IRA (nationalists), led by Gerry Adams, the road to peace has been a torturous one characterized by violence, set-backs and numerous false starts. Only recently the Ulster Defence Association, Northern Ireland's largest loyalist group, said it will cease to be an armed paramilitary group, starting at midnight on November 11, saying the ""war is over."" ""All weaponry will be put beyond use,"" Colin Halliday of the Ulster Political Research Group, which is linked to the group, said in a speech in Belfast aired by RTE, Ireland's state-owned broadcaster. ""The struggle to maintain the union is on a new and more complex battlefield."" The Irish Republican Army (IRA) disarmed two years ago, helping to restore the province's government in Belfast. Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern said the most recent moves of groups to disarm was ""significant and hopefully signals a further step toward the ending of all paramilitarism in Northern Ireland."" For those that have lived through the turmoil in Northern Ireland, peace achieved though diplomacy must have seemed like an unrealistic goal. After all, each attack by loyalists usually resulted in retaliation by nationalists -- making the dispute bitter and intractable. But diplomacy has worked in bringing peace to Northern Ireland. Credit for developing a framework for the peace process stretches back to former British Prime Minster John Major's rule in the 1990s and efforts by Ireland's Ahern. But it was Major's successor, Tony Blair, who was unrelenting in his quest for peace by making it a major priority of his government. Blair came to Northern Ireland 37 times as Prime Minister, traveling there more often than any of his predecessors as well as hosting many meetings at 10 Downing Street and discussing the peace process while at many international summits. According to the Belfast Telegraph: ""When he (Blair) said on that first day he had come to seek 'a lasting and fair political settlement' it turned out he wasn't spouting platitudes on a stump."" Journalist James Button, who covered the peace process talks, says: ""Blair played a clever hand. He saw the hardliners had to be involved. ""Critically he judged that the process had to tilt ever so slightly towards the republicans to prevent a split in their ranks and the resumption of violence by radicals -- which had happened whenever the republican leadership had inclined to moderation before."" Button says Downing Street had a bicycle theory around peace talks: ""They had to keep going forward otherwise they would fall over."" It was Blair's diplomacy that wooed the previously immovable Paisley. Irish political scientist Lord Bew told the Guardian the alliance with Paisley was Blair's ""last great romance... Once again when we thought the old maestro was fading, his capacity to seduce, politically speaking, is phenomenal."" But as Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein told CNN, the conflict was primarily a local one that needed to be solved by local people: ""The people who have to be the brokers are the people who live in the areas of conflict. ""They're the people who ought to be the brokers but everybody else from the outside has to enhance the conditions so that those leaders or factions can actually broker not just an agreement, but implement an agreement. ""The Good Friday Agreement -- and [former U.S.] Senator [George] Mitchell said this at the time, when we got the agreement -- ""That's the easy bit. Implementing it is going to be the difficult bit."" Mitchell worked with the various participants to reach an agreement. The long road to peace . The ""troubles"" have been a centuries-old dispute between England and Ireland over who controls Northern Ireland. In 1609 British colonial settlers confiscated native-owned land in Northern Ireland and settled in Ulster with mainly Protestant British planters. There was conflict between the planters and the native Irish. The planters won the bloody ethno-religious conflicts that followed and cracked down on the political and religious freedoms of the indigenous Irish. In the 1700s groups formed (including the Ulster Orangemen that continue to this day) and antagonisms between the two communities became entrenched. Ireland was incorporated into the UK in 1801 and reformers such as Daniel O'Connell called for the repeal of the union as well as the end of discrimination of Catholics (around 75 percent of the population). The agitation of the Irish Parliamentary Party, who sometimes held the balance of power in Westminster, led to the unionists further entrenching their position for British rule. In 1920 guerilla warfare between what became known as the IRA and Unionists led to the partitioning of southern Ireland and Northern Ireland. Nationalists in Northern Ireland, who numbered around 35 per cent of the population, did not accept legitimacy of the new partition. Between 1970 and 1972 tensions that had been brewing erupted into violence with almost 500 people killed in Northern Ireland. One explanation for this was the formation of the real IRA, which embraced ""armed struggle"" against British rule. Another was the introduction of internment without trial (the vast majority of those imprisoned were Catholic) which succeed in politicizing many into the nationalist cause. Bloody Sunday -- a January 1972 shooting in Derry of 14 unarmed nationalist civil rights activists by the British Army -- was a flashpoint in the conflict. In 1972 the retaliation of the Provos came at a massive cost -- more than 100 soldiers were killed, 500 were wounded and there were 1300 bombings. Yet the nationalists vowed to continue their campaign until there was a united Ireland. Successive British governments failed to solve the ""Irish question"" so the participants settled in for what the IRA called the Long War, which involved sustained, low-level violence, hunger strikes and protests. The stop-start cease-fire . Since the late 1980s Sinn Fein, which compared its struggle to that of the fight for liberation in Palestine and South Africa, has sought a negotiated end to the conflict. Both loyalist and republican paramilitary groups declared a cease-fire after much negotiation. But the peace was fragile and short-lived. The IRA, led by Adams, revoked the cease-fire in 1996 after a bombing at Canary Wharf in London that killed two and caused £85 million worth of damage. In June 1996 a large part of Manchester's city center was destroyed by an IRA bomb that injured 200 people. Splinter groups of the IRA who rejected the notion of a cease-fire continued their campaigns. In August 1998 the Real IRA bombed Omagh, killing 29 civilians. But during the 1990s many world leaders still held out for peace in Northern Ireland. Supporters of talks included the president of the U.S., Bill Clinton, who in 1995 visited Northern Ireland and spoke in Belfast of the ""peace process,"" calling terrorists ""yesterday's men."" Diplomacy in action . In 1997 newly elected British Prime Minister Tony Blair endorsed a report on decommissioning and the criteria for inclusion in all-party talks. Mo Mowlam, the UK's Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, accepted in August 1997 that the IRA cease-fire was genuine and invited Sinn Fein for multi-party talks. On Good Friday, April 10 1998, it was announced that the two governments and political parties in Northern Ireland had reached an agreement to share power. It later emerged that President Clinton had made a number of calls to party leaders to encourage them to reach an agreement. The agreement included a devolved, inclusive government, prisoner release, troop reduction, paramilitary decommissioning, and the addressing of the question of Irish reunification. The definitive end of the peace process -- and the Troubles - came in 2007 following the St Andrews agreement in October 2006 and the March 2007 elections. The Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn Fein formed a government in May 2007 and in July 2007 the British Army formally ended their mission in Northern Ireland, 38 years after their deployment. Today, Northern Ireland is still part of the United Kingdom but the British government has said if there is a majority of votes then a united Ireland will be possible. The key to winning support from the Nationalists/ Republicans was the British Government recognizing the ""Irish Dimension"" -- that the Irish as a whole should have the right to work out the issues between the North and the South, without outside interference. Prosperity and peace . According to an article in the Financial Times, former sectarians have been tamed not only by peace but also by prosperity. ""The little brick houses which rose 56 percent in price in the last year cost more than the English average. There are Japanese restaurants. The locals fly from George Best Airport to their Alpine second homes. These people are, in the local phase, 'recovering sectarians,'"" according to the FT. Aiding this process is the European Union, which is flooding Northern Ireland with funds, believing that the peace and diplomatic process needs to be financially assisted. The European Union's investment, worth 724 million euros (about 1.03 billion U.S. dollars) will be made available through the three programs -- the PEACE III program, the cross-border cooperation program with Ireland and Scotland, and the Regional Competitiveness and Employment program for the province. But peace and prosperity would not have occurred without the success of diplomacy, says Adams. ""There's been a war somewhere in the world for every day of every week of every month of the last few decades and all of them are caused by human beings, mostly by men ... all of them can be resolved through dialogue.""

"Editor's note: The staff at CNN.com has been intrigued by the journalism of Vice, an independent media company and Web site based in Brooklyn, New York. Motherboard.tv is Vice's site devoted to the overlap between culture and technology. The reports, which are being produced solely by Vice, reflect a very transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers. Brooklyn, New York (Motherboard.tv) -- Ghana is doing extremely well by African standards. Of course ""by African standards"" means there are dirt roads leading past the brand-new, gold-columned presidential palace, and it seems 1 percent of the country is blowing their country's GDP at bars with $50 cover charges while the other 99 is selling bags of water at stop lights. They have huge mineral reserves and lots of foreign money invested in their extraction, all of which ends up concentrated in the hands of the president, his cabinet, and whichever of their cousins they're getting along with at the time. The Ghanaian government likes to boast that their unemployment rate is in the single digits and they're creating millions of new jobs a year specifically targeting the youth bulge, but when you pull up a pile of rubble and sit down with a member of said bulge, the story seems a lot less cheery. The actual unemployment rate for 15- to 24-year-olds hovers between 25 and 30 percent and unless you're a relative or close friend of someone in the ruling class, you can look forward to a long and fruitful career in water sales. But Ghana also has a reasonably sophisticated technology infrastructure and has declared itself the ""Internet Capital of West Africa,"" which is kind of archly tragic because right now the internet is the only thing keeping the kids at bay. During Nigeria's oil boom in the 70s, Ghanaians flooded into the country to take guest worker jobs. Within 10 years they'd worn out their welcome and were deported en mass back to Ghana, but not before they'd picked up a popular local pastime: the Nigerian ""pen pal scam."" The way it works is you become pen pals with some dolt in America or Britain, bitch about how hard your life is in Africa, then wait for them to send you money and presents. See the rest of The Sakawa Boys at Motherboard.tv . As computers made their way into the continent, the scam was adapted to e-mail and gradually evolved into the rainbow of weird phishing messages from state treasurers and estate managers and plane-crash lawyers that crowd your inbox every morning. And as scammers got hungrier for bigger pickins, they hooked up with hacker-types from the U.S. and Europe who taught them basic credit card fraud, which they combined with the playacting of the e-mail scam to create increasingly elaborate -- and profitable -- superscams. Then for some reason they combined all of this with black magic, and that's how Sakawa was born. In the same way that hip-hop went from a music style into a descriptor for everything from pants to dancing to potato chips, Sakawa (which originally referred to a specific credit card scam) now means pretty much anything involving money -- if you wear a bunch of flashy brand-name clothes you're dressing ""Sakawa,"" if you've got a nice car it's a ""Sakawa"" car -- all of which makes sense considering internet scamming is the only way most Ghanaians can afford this. Right now Sakawa is in its salad days. The Sakawa Boys movie franchise has made it up to ""Sakawa Boys 8,"" Juju priests are making a killing enchanting e-mails, Christian preachers are making a killing complaining about enchanted e-mails, and Ghanaians of all ages and interests (but mostly ""young"" and ""not being poor"") are packed into internet cafes finding more and more ingenious ways of ripping off Westerners. While a lot of Sakawa practitioners have cooked up elaborate post-colonial justifications where they're just getting the white man back for taking all their gold, a few, like our guide Seva, see Sakawa for what it really is: a massive bubble just waiting to burst. As Ghana overtakes freaking Nigeria as the e-fraud capital of the world, the government is scrambling to find a way to keep Sakawa from wrecking the country's business reputation without cutting off an entire young generation from their sole source of steady revenue. And just to make things more interesting, Ghana just discovered oil.","Motherboard.tv goes to Ghana to learn about Sakawa, a criminal world of e-mail scammers .

"(CNN) -- Judd Apatow is the man behind many of the most successful comic movies of recent years. Apatow's latest comedy ""Funny People"" pairs Adam Sandler (left) with Seth Rogen (right). As a producer Apatow's resume reads like an encyclopedia of comedy hits: ""Anchorman,"" ""Talladega Nights,"" ""Superbad,"" ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall,"" ""Step Brothers"" -- the list goes on. As a writer and director he is less prodigious, though his two efforts so far -- ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" and ""Knocked Up"" -- have garnered commercial and critical success. His brand is about as hot as it gets in U.S. comedy these days with his latest offering as director, ""Funny People"" grabbing the highest share of the American box office with $23.4 million on its first weekend. The 41-year-old American has an innate understanding of what makes people laugh. A former stand-up comic and writer for television sitcoms like ""The Larry Sandler Show,"" Apatow has taken to heart that old maxim that the best comedy is born out of tragedy. ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin,"" for example, follows the painful attempts of a socially awkward nerd to lose his virginity, while ""Knocked Up"" is about a pregnancy resulting from a one-night stand. Contrary to what its upbeat title might suggest, ""Funny People"" delves into even darker territory. The movie stars Apatow's former flatmate Adam Sandler as a famous comedian who is struck down with leukemia. ""I see all the movies as dealing with my personal problems, whether it's about virginity, bad sex, marital issues, unplanned pregnancy or, in the case of this one, death,"" Apatow told CNN. Part of the reason the Apatow brand has grown so strong is his habit of collaborating with the same group of writers and performers. Via his production company he has helped to foster the acting careers of Steve Carell, Paul Rudd and Seth Rogen. ""When someone is really good I don't want to let go of them,"" he said. ""Every time we meet someone new and they're great we think 'I want to use that person on the next one' because it's so hard to find someone that's hysterical, interesting and fun to be around."" Surprisingly, considering their longtime association, ""Funny People"" is the first time Apatow has helmed a feature with Sandler in it. In the movie, which also stars the director's wife Leslie Mann, Sandler's character is prompted by illness to re-evaluate his life. This leads on a journey of self discovery that takes him back to his roots as a stand-up comic. To gather material for the movie Apatow, Sandler and co-star Seth Rogen followed a similar trajectory, going to comedy clubs together and, according to Apatow ""doing stand-up and bombing."" It was a nostalgic experience for Apatow and Sandler in particular, who shared an apartment in Los Angeles when they were in their twenties and both struggling comedians trying to catch a break. ""A little bit of the movie has some aspect of our repartee,"" the director told CNN. ""But that was a different time. We were really young and hungry and trying to figure out how we were going to be accepted in the world of comics and movies. ""It was very fun and exciting and we slept till noon everyday and had red lobster for lunch. So we always reminisce about that time because we had nothing going on other than our comedy sets at night.""","Judd Apatow has had a hand in a huge number of recent comedy hits .

"(CNN) -- A 65-year-old suspect in a $7 million Connecticut robbery was arrested more than two decades after the heist, the FBI said in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Norberto Gonzalez Claudio was arrested Tuesday in Cayey, Puerto Rico, the FBI said in a statement. Gonzalez Claudio is accused of participating in the armed robbery of a Connecticut Wells Fargo depot on September 12, 1983. According to the FBI in Connecticut, the robbery of the armored car facility in West Hartford was one of the largest cash heists at the time, and dozens of collaborators have been arrested. Two of Gonzalez Claudio's brothers were also indicted for the heist. Avelino Gonzalez Claudio was arrested in 2008 and sentenced in 2010 to seven years in prison. According to court records, Orlando Gonzalez Claudio was given probation in another case. It was not clear if he served time for the robbery. A federal arrest warrant was issued in August 1985 charging Gonzalez Claudio with obstruction of commerce by robbery and conspiracy, the FBI said. Another warrant was issued in March 1986 charging Gonzalez Claudio with bank robbery, aggravated robbery, theft from interstate shipment, foreign and interstate transportation of stolen money, and conspiracy to interfere with commerce by robbery, the FBI said. If convicted, Gonzalez Claudio could face 275 years of imprisonment. The FBI said Gonzalez Claudio, a native of Puerto Rico, is believed to be a member of the domestic terrorist organization Los Macheteros -- or ""the machete wielders"" -- which has claimed responsibility for several murders, armed robberies and terrorist bombings. The U.S. Attorney's Office in Connecticut has said the robbery was committed to fund the activities of Los Macheteros. ""The publicly stated goal of the Macheteros is to obtain the independence of Puerto Rico by armed struggle against the United States government,"" the FBI has said. According to a 1985 indictment, the Macheteros funded themselves through ""expropriations,"" including robbery. Norberto Gonzalez Claudio and his brother Avelino are listed in the indictment as belonging to the group of Macheteros who devised the plan for Victor Manuel Gerena, an employee of Wells Fargo Armored Service, to rob his own company. The organization used nicknames and codenames to avoid detection, the indictment states. Gerena, who was also a Macheteros member, was known as ""Aguila,"" or eagle. The operation was known as the White Eagle. After the robbery, the Macheteros moved Gerena and some of the stolen money into Mexico, the indictment states. After that, the group moved more money. The same month as the robbery, the Macheteros transported Gerena to Cuba, according to the indictment. Among the activities the group carried out with the stolen money was a gift giveaway in Puerto Rico, the court document states. Although not as well known as other organizations with the terrorist label, the Macheteros in the late 1970s and 1980s claimed responsibility for numerous bombings and attacks on U.S. military personnel in Puerto Rico.","Norberto Gonzalez Claudio is arrested in Puerto Rico .

"Washington (CNN)  -- An air traffic controller and his supervisor are under investigation because the controller allegedly brought his two small children into the control tower and allowed them to speak with pilots on an air traffic control frequency. The incidents occurred on succeeding days last month at New York's John F. Kennedy Airport, the Federal Aviation Administration said Wednesday. Both the controller and the supervisor have been placed on paid administrative leave. ""This lapse in judgment not only violated FAA's own policies but common sense standards for professional conduct. These kinds of distractions are totally unacceptable,"" administrator Randy Babbitt said in the statement. ""We have an incredible team of professionals who safely control our nation's skies every single day. This kind of behavior does not reflect the true caliber of our work force."" Babbitt's statement concerned an incident that took place on February 16 involving the controller's young son, who is heard in a recording -- posted on liveatc.net -- clearing a Jet Blue flight for takeoff and later speaking to an apparent Air Mexico flight. Later, an FAA official who asked not to be identified because of the ongoing investigation said the controller brought his daughter into the same tower the following day, and the child was allowed to talk with pilots of two planes. A source familiar with the investigation said the supervisor ""should be making sure that things like this don't happen."" A separate source familiar with the investigation said the two children are twins. The controller and supervisor involved are both veteran employees, the official said. But Dave Pascoe owner of the Web site where recordings of the air traffic communications are posted, told CNN he believes the attention the incident has drawn is ""ridiculous"" and it has been ""blown out of proportion."" In one recording, a child can be heard saying, ""JetBlue 171, cleared for takeoff."" A man is then heard telling the plane, ""Here's what you get, guys, when the kids are out of school."" The pilot chuckles and says, ""Wish I could bring my kid to work."" The same pilot later tells the child, ""Awesome job."" During the recording, the child also speaks to an apparent Air Mexico flight. FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown later said the incident took place about 7:30 p.m. February 16. A recording from the following day, when the daughter was reportedly in the tower, was also posted on the Web site. Pascoe said most people ""in the aviation community felt like this was [not] anything more than a noble thing, that a father would take his kid to work. ""And when you listen to any of the recordings, the situation in the tower is very controlled. There is no hint ... that anyone was too busy or anyone was interrupting the planes. ... It was very controlled, and I don't think safety was compromised, nor should anyone be disciplined for this,"" said Pascoe, who is also a pilot. The recording was from a network of receivers, he said, but couldn't reveal the source. The site exists for pilot education, he said, and sometimes other curious parties listen in. There was ""absolutely no security threat"" posed by the incident, he said. ""I have every belief that they'd make sure there were additional eyes there,"" Pascoe said. ""Only the best of the best work at JFK tower, and they are the best at what they do. ""If you know anything about aviation, you know that the air traffic control towers are highly supervised,"" he said. ""JFK is highly supervised. It's not just one controller controlling the runway. Supervisors are there, and multiple people are there making sure by looking through binoculars and at radar. ... A father was taking a child to work and let the kid clear planes for takeoff, and now the world thinks it's an unsafe place."" The FAA said all unofficial visits to air traffic control operational areas, such as towers and radar rooms, will be suspended during its investigation into the incident. Babbitt has directed a team to review air traffic control policies and procedures related to facility visitors. The National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the union representing controllers, said in a statement, ""We do not condone this type of behavior in any way. ""It is not indicative of the highest professional standards that controllers set for themselves and exceed each and every day in the advancement of aviation safety,"" spokesman Doug Church said in the statement. CNN's Mike Ahlers, Jean Shin and Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.","Air traffic controller at New York airport brought young children to work .

"Nashville, Tennessee (CNN) -- Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin drew many standing ovations from a friendly crowd Saturday night as she blasted Washington Democrats and the Obama administration in a keynote speech for what was billed as the first national Tea Party Convention. ""It's so inspiring to see real people, not politicos, inside-the-beltway professionals, come out, stand up and speak out for common-sense conservative principles,"" Palin said. Palin sought to hold Washington accountable as she took on a number of issues, including national security, the economy, and the recent election of Republican Scott Brown to the Massachusetts Senate seat left vacant by the late Ted Kennedy. ""America is ready for another revolution and you are a part of this,"" Palin said. She called the Tea Party movement a ""ground-up call to action that is forcing both parties to change the way they're doing business."" Palin gave particular attention to Brown's election, calling him a representative ""of this beautiful movement."" ""If there's hope in Massachusetts, there's hope everywhere,"" she said. ""His victory is a sign of more good things to come."" She called on the administration to take note of the election results, saying ""you better stop lecturing and start listening."" ""The Obama-Pelosi-Reid agenda will leave us less secure, more in debt and under the thumb of big government,"" she added, saying voters all over the country are sending a message that they want change in Washington. She harkened Obama's famous campaign slogan, asking, ""How's that hope-y, change-y stuff working out for you?"" Palin answers questions . On national security, Palin said Americans have grown uneasy in the wake of an attempted Christmas Day terror attack aboard a U.S.-bound flight from Amsterdam, Netherlands. She called on the administration to be transparent about threats facing the country. ""It's not politicizing our security to discuss our concerns because Americans deserve to know the truths about the threats that we face,"" she said, criticizing Obama's approach to foreign policy with such hostile regimes as Iran. On the economy, Palin said ""we are drowning in national debt and many of us have had enough,"" calling for a number of different reforms. Palin was the darling of many conservatives when she served as the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee, which she said Saturday night was ""the honor of a lifetime."" Many of those attending the convention at Nashville's Gaylord Opryland Hotel and Convention Center said they are big Palin supporters. Tea Party meets in Nashville . Pam Silleman, a 52-year-old small business owner and Tea Party activist who traveled to the convention from California's Napa Valley, called Palin ""the Tea Party's inspiration."" Asked if Palin, who is considered a possible contender for the 2012 GOP presidential nomination, should make a bid for the White House, Silleman said, ""I would like to see her in a higher office but I don't know that she'll do it. I wouldn't want her to be hurt that bad."" Fremont Brown, a supporter who had ""Palin 2012"" bumper stickers with him, said Palin is ""the right person."" ""She has fervent heart and she's conservative,"" added the 59-year-old Brown, who owns a small business in North Carolina. ""She was the only one truly qualified with executive experience of the four who ran in 2008. The others were glorified lobbyists."" If Palin does make a stab at presidential politics, she'll have a natural following among Tea Party activists, whose grass-roots network is fueled by anger over the growth of the federal government and President Obama's policies. Neither the Tea Party Nation, the group that organized the convention, nor a Palin spokeswoman would confirm reports that the former governor is getting paid about $100,000 for her keynote appearance. ""I will not benefit financially from speaking at this event,"" Palin said in a statement this week. ""Any compensation for my appearance will go right back to the cause."" In a blog post on the conservative Web site Townhall.com this past week, Palin said she looks forward to greater participation with the Tea Party movement in the coming weeks. She said she will be on hand next month for a kickoff rally for the third Tea Party Express, a cross-country bus caravan. The event will take place March 27 in Searchlight, Nevada, the hometown of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who finds himself in a tough re-election battle this year. Palin also said she will attend an April 14 Tea Party rally in Boston. Watch more on Tea Party movement . A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. national poll released Friday indicates that Americans are split on Palin, with 43 percent seeing her in a positive light and 46 percent holding an unfavorable view. ""Opinion on Sarah Palin breaks down along party lines, with 7 in 10 Democrats disliking her and 7 in 10 Republicans with a positive view of Palin. She has a net-negative rating among Independents: 42 percent favorable and 47 percent unfavorable,"" said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. ""She also continues to rate better among men than women."" iReport: React to Tea Party convention, Palin speech . Palin's experience has frequently been called into question, most recently in a book that chronicles the 2008 campaign. ""Game Change"" by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann largely portrays the then-vice presidential candidate as wholly unprepared for the national stage and poorly versed in a range of pressing issues. The book also alleges McCain aides quickly grew troubled with Palin's lack of understanding on key issues, including the job of the Federal Reserve, the difference between North Korea and South Korea, and the purpose of the war in Afghanistan. Palin has called the book ""a bunch of BS from [McCain campaign manager Steve] Schmidt and those guys,"" Palin said. ""It's pretty made up."" CNN's Alex Mooney, Paul Steinhauser and Pamela Sellers contributed to this report.","Palin adopts scathing tone as she addresses national security, the economy .

"(CNN) -- Sure, lots of folks might be excited about a Twitter-like social network with no ads or annoying ""promoted tweets."" But would they pay for it? The founders of App.net think so, and so far they've found more than 10,000 people who agree with them. The startup promises a ""real-time feed"" that will never be supported by ads. Instead, they'll charge a fee that, at least for now, looks to be about $50. That's how much it took to support a Kickstarter-like fundraising campaign that has netted more than $670,000 and wraps up Monday. Founder and CEO Dalton Caldwell says he's been disappointed by the advertising models of sites like Twitter and Facebook and thinks users will be willing to plunk down money for an alternative. ""If we're selling a service, our customers are our users and our job is to make our users happy,"" he said in a video promoting the service. ""If we have a free, ad-supported service, our customers are our advertisers and our job is to make our advertisers happy. ""I think that a lot of the friction we're seeing from these disappointing services are just a reflection that all the financial incentive has to do with pleasing advertisers and not the user base."" The logic contains plenty of not-so-veiled swipes at both Twitter and Facebook. After gaining widespread popularity with no real means of making money, Twitter has begun selling promoted tweets, promoted trends and promoted accounts. But it's also kept a firm grip on its ecosystem by not allowing much leeway for outside developers to tinker. Caldwell promises to do the opposite. The multibillion-dollar profits of Facebook come primarly from advertising, leading to a commonly repeated line that Caldwell appears to echo: ""If you're not paying for a service, you're not the customer -- you're the product."" (If that wasn't clear enough, there's also the bristly open letter Caldwell wrote to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg earlier this month, in which he pledges ""to never write another line of code for rotten-to-the-core 'platforms' like Facebook or Twitter."") But the question remains: Will users be willing to pay to use a social network? It would be a model that's never been successful before. Michael Gartenberg, a tech-industry analyst with research firm Gartner Inc., sees some potential. Avoiding ads and opening the service up to developers could offer a glimpse at what Twitter could have become if its creators took a different path, he said. ""I think people are getting hung up on the $50 thing right now,"" said Gartenberg, who predicts that a membership fee for App.net will ultimately be less than that. ""It was about, 'Are people serious enough about this as an idea to put $50 on the line to help try to create the kind of service they want?"" The success of their fundraiser ""shows there's definitely a demand,"" he said. According to the fundraiser, $50 amounts to ""pre-paying a full year of 'member' tier service."" Developers pay $100, and big spenders who pony up $1,000 -- as of Monday morning, 60 folks had pledged that much -- get developer access, phone support and a meeting with Caldwell in San Francisco. This isn't Dalton's first crack at social media. In 2003, he co-founded iMeem, a social site on which users shared music and videos, and in 2010 launched PicPlz, a mobile photo app that allowed users to add visual effects. iMeem was acquired by Myspace and, in June, PicPlz announced it was shutting down as Facebook-aligned Instagram continued to dominate the photo-sharing space. Is App.net bound for the same fate? Other efforts that generated initial buzz have faded. Most notably, Diaspora became one of Kickstarter's first success stories, raising $200,000 in 2010 to launch a ""privacy-aware,"" open-source alternative to Facebook. But it took months to actually launch and, two years later, remains a relatively tiny network that's home only to the most dedicated techies. App.net ""is a really interesting experiment,"" Gartenberg said. ""Time will tell if there's a business here. But when Twitter started, I don't think anyone knew there was a business there either. It was a way to tell people what you had for lunch."" App.net is currently open in an early ""alpha"" version for donors. Caldwell emphasizes that a great deal of work needs to be done before the platform is finished. But he wanted to provide something to show backers that the service is on its way. ""Along these lines, there are still a great many questions that need to be answered before App.net should be thought of as an operating service, rather than just an alpha prototype,"" he wrote.","App.net plans to offer an ad-free alternative to Twitter, but users will have to pay .

"(CNN) -- For an awards show that's not the Oscars, the 2012 Golden Globes attracted a good amount of attention. About 16.8 million people -- a slight dip from last year's 17 million viewers -- tuned in to the event that elicited countless trending topics on Twitter, status updates on Facebook, inches in newspapers and articles online. Yes, it's that time of year again when starlets show off their best assets in designer gowns, tiny statues are handed out and the world gets to critique who worked the red carpet. Awards season officially kicked off on television last Sunday night with the Golden Globes and the media was notably underwhelmed by the soiree while viewers seemed split on host Ricky Gervais' toned-down performance. So why not just change the channel? Awards shows are among the few glamorous Hollywood events that are open to the public, said Mary McNamara, a TV critic at the Los Angeles Times. But it's not just about the glitz, the couture and the celebrity. ""When even reality TV is scripted, there's something refreshing about seeing something that could be unpredictable,"" said Daniel Manu, the site director of Television Without Pity. ""You don't know what (the winners) will say when they get up there. You might see a truly human moment from people who are usually ... on point."" Nobody expected lead actress in a drama winner Meryl Streep to curse upon realizing she left her glasses at her seat at Sunday's Globes. And nobody knew how presenters Rob Lowe and Julianne Moore would recover when the teleprompter malfunctioned (by joking about doing a cold read in front of Steven Spielberg.) ""Someone is going to make a mistake,"" McNamara said. ""Somebody's dress is going to be terrible. It's a wonderful opportunity to vent about Hollywood and celebrity culture while also participating in it."" And social media has only amplified our will to participate. ""People have been having Oscar parties for years,"" Manu said. ""Sitting around someone's living room and making jokes."" It's just that nobody could hear them, he said. Enter Twitter. ""Without the Internet, the Golden Globes wouldn't be fun to watch,"" Manu said. ""Fans and critics can instantly respond on Twitter and comment back to these shows. In a way, awards shows are more fun now, regardless of the host and nominees. Technology allows us to respond immediately. And snark immediately."" The social media aspect also pressures viewers to watch the shows live. Nobody wants to be the guy tweeting about Ricky Gervais' monologue halfway through the Golden Globes, Manu said. ""For social media, the Oscars and the Golden Globes, certainly, are giant piÃ±atas,"" McNamara said. ""We whack away and send mean tweets and are hilariously funny and wicked."" Pete Cashmore, founder and CEO of Mashable, wrote in a column for CNN that he actually watched the recent Globes live because of social media. ""I didn't plan to watch the Globes, but as Twitter and Facebook lit up with buzz, I couldn't help but be drawn in,"" he wrote. Even people who approach awards shows with the ""I would never watch"" attitude are still somehow in the know, McNamara said. Maybe they didn't watch it live, or they watched parts on YouTube after the fact. Either way, they're aware of what happened. ""TV is a true democracy,"" she said. ""If you want (an awards show) to go away, don't watch it. If the ratings fall, it won't be on TV. ... Nothing is easier to get rid of than a TV show.""","About 16.8 million people tuned into the Golden Globes on Sunday .

"(CNN) -- The Brits called it the ""Great War."" To the Yanks, it was the ""World War."" No one wanted to think there could be a second. Though World War I, which began 100 years ago next month, devastated lives and landscapes, its effect on language was almost paradoxically positive. It spawned hundreds of new words and popularized scores of old ones. Many of them survive today -- there are ""cooties,"" ""camouflage,"" ""scrounge"" and ""dud,"" for example -- but many have lost their once-widely recognized associations with the war that was hoped would ""end war."" Total war, as the world twice found out in the past century, is a turbulent time. It is for language, too. As new concerns, new methods, new technologies and new experiences multiply, vocabulary by necessity tries to keep up. Obscure old words can get a new lease on life. World War I gave the English language new terms as varied as ""blimp"" and ""Boches"" and ""devil dog"" and even ""D-Day."" It popularized military slang like ""doughboy"" and ""fed up."" It dragooned older terms for wider application, such as ""Yank"" and ""no-man's land."" Some words prominent in 1914-18 have pretty much fallen from use. Others remain as well-known as the war's idealistic slogans, like H. G. Wells' call for ""a war to end wars"" and Woodrow Wilson's to make the world ""safe for democracy."" As a multilingual war, it promptly enriched the English language with terms of international origin. Air reconnaissance made military and naval ""camouflage,"" another French word, a necessity. The same might be said of the French 75 cocktail, named for the war's most effective artillery piece. And historians writing in English still use the Gallic ""poilu"" for a French combat soldier and ""Boches"" for the Germans. Older terms and nicknames sometimes gained new popularity that guaranteed they'd remain in English long after soldiers returned home. George M. Cohan's smash hit ""Over There"" (1917) was the catchiest American patriotic song ever, and when he wrote that ""The Yanks are coming,"" he followed the British, not the American, use of the Civil War term to encompass all Americans, north and south of the Mason-Dixon Line. ""Doughboy"" was a new one on most people, but it had meant an infantryman since the Mexican-American War of the 1840s, for no very clear reason; now, it's the usual synonym for the American soldier of the First World War. ""Leatherneck,"" which also looked new but wasn't, denoted the U.S. Marine, whose 19th-century uniform had featured a high leather collar that sailors ridiculed. Opinion: How a century-old war affects you . A Wisconsin newspaper claimed in 1918 that the Germans thought American Marines fought like Teufelhunden, or ""devil dogs""; the supposedly German word sounds ersatz, but the English version is still heard in the Corps. (Sailors were ""gobs""; fliers were ""birdmen""; pals were ""buddies"": all pre-war, all truly mainstream for the first time in 1914-18.) ""G.I.,"" which meant only ""galvanized iron"" and ""government issue"" in World War I, eventually became the World War II term for a U.S. soldier. The everyday life of those soldiers spawned many words and expressions. When kids talk of ""cooties,"" they don't realize what everyone knew by 1918: It was a new term for lice, which burrowed into the clothes of any and all who served on the front lines. ""Chow,"" for food, owes its popularity mostly to the U.S. military of World War I. From the British came the expressions ""to scrounge"" (to search for and, if necessary, pilfer), ""cushy"" (enviably comfortable) and ""fed up"" (disgusted with it all), three salient soldier concepts in any war. Trench warfare became a sinister science, as front-line troops of every army hunkered down for hundreds of miles in conditions of appalling filth and danger. Playwright George Bernard Shaw, an opponent of the war, popularized the once-uncommon phrase ""cannon fodder,"" which suggested that soldiers of all nations had been impersonally requisitioned to feed the guns or duped into enlisting by interchangeably imperialist rulers. To name what lay between the entrenched armies, modern English enlisted a phrase from the Middle Ages: ""no-man's land."" The shell-pocked muck between the opposing trenches, bounded by rotting sandbags and rusted heaps of barbed wire, gave the 14th-century meaning of ""unowned or uninhabited territory"" a much grimmer connotation. Before World War I, a ""dud"" was anything or anybody unsatisfactory, but by the time the conflict ended, ""dud"" referred chiefly to an unexploded shell or bomb, as it does to this day. The British began speaking of defensive ""foxholes,"" dug not by foxes but by soldiers on the battlefield, a word that now may seem as old as shooting wars themselves. The adjustment of a rifle's battle-sight was ""zeroing in,"" a metaphor today's English can't do without. Then there's ""D-Day"": the very first was September 26, 1918, the starting date of the war-ending Allied offensive in the Argonne Forest. Familiar now as an advertising platform, the helium-filled ""blimp"" was invented for naval observation in 1915. The British came up with the armored ""tank"" and named it arbitrarily to keep the weapon secret before its surprise appearance in the Battle of the Somme in 1916. The threat of ""chemical warfare"" and ""chemical weapons"" had been discussed in the press, but their actual use by Germany in 1915, first in Poland and then in Belgium, raised the war's quotient of barbarism. The Allies quickly followed suit. ""Air raids,"" which began on a small scale in 1914, were carried out by four-winged bombers and German Zeppelins. The idea of bomb-laden squadrons of Zeppelins over London may seem like something from Victorian science fiction, and it was novelist H.G. Wells (author of ""War of the Worlds"") who invented the most ominous phrase of all. In 1914, he imagined a device that might appear within a generation, whose destructive power would change everything forever. Wells warned that eventually ""any little body of malcontents could use it."" As though in prophecy of the long shadow the 1914-18 war would cast on the 20th century, Wells coined a now-familiar term for his imaginary superweapon that he believed could easily ""wreck half a city."" He called it ""the atomic bomb.""","Jonathan Lighter: World War I brought slew of new words into use to express the turbulent time .

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- Lazy, promiscuous, confused, selfish, brain damaged and overall hopeless are all labels that have been given to China's so-called post-90s generation, or those who were born after 1990 who are now mostly in their teens today. Whatever the post-90s are, one thing for certain is they are different from those born before them: they have no memory of China's tumultuous past, instead only experiencing it as a country with rapid economic growth underscored by rampant consumerism and globalization. ""They have only known a life in China that is rising and affluent,"" Frank Yu, a Beijing-based internet analyst, said. ""They are considered a wild card generation. They are very aggressive and outward looking and are pretty confident because they never felt hardship."" And they are also the first generation that has grown up with the internet. And it is there, online, where they live lives that are a marked departure from age-old cultural norms that remain ingrained in Chinese society today. ""When they turn away from the internet and look at the real world and they see that nothing has changed, there is this huge disconnect in their minds,"" said Kevin Lee, chief operating officer for China Youthology, a Beijing-based research firm. ""Their minds are in this internet way of thinking, and when their real world is not even moving, not even budging, they feel powerless. And so where do they escape? They go back to the internet."" The Web is one of the few, if only places, where those who are not post-90s can see their sometimes radical behavior, try to communicate with them and attempt to figure out who, exactly, they are and what, exactly, they are thinking. ""On the internet, they have the chance to be individuals,"" said Zakfa Zhang, also with China Youthology. ""It is a totally new space for the youth to feel independent. They can criticize anyone, and no one will tell them they are wrong, and they can express themselves online without many restrictions."" The ways in which China's teens express themselves online vary. They hang out on Chinese social networks, like Kaixin001 and Renren, post comments on microblogs as well as use Tencent's highly popular instant messaging service QQ and Qzone, its social networking site and other online bulletin boards. On these platforms, they form what some have described as ""tribes"" or ""clans"" that can consist of thousands of members communicating via ""Martian"" language. ""The 'Martian' dialect most closely identified with the post-90s alternative subculture is 'brain-damaged writing', which is essentially standard Mandarin written using the most obscure characters possible,"" writes Adam Schokora, a Shanghai-based internet analyst on the blog Fifty 5. The post-90s virtual world is also characterized by the photos and videos they share online. Young women often post cartoon-like pictures of themselves with pursed lips, Photoshop-enlarged eyes (to appear more like an animated characters) while wearing chunky glasses, sexy, doll-like clothing or goth and punk styles borrowed from Japan and Korea. ""They want to show off: 'I am beautiful. I am special. I am a star,'"" Zhang said. A post on the blog China Hush titled ""A Series of Post-90s Generation's Bad Behaviors"" shows some of the more shocking sexual content the teen post online: ""The general impression is Post-90s kids are 'out of control,' behaving badly'...'have mental problems' and are 'engaging in sexual activities way too early,'"" the post says. Not everyone views their behavior so negatively. ""In the virtual world, they learn how to be leaders, to solve interpersonal conflicts,"" said Han Yinbo, co-author of ""An Exploding Internet Revolution."" ""These online activities make them more mature, give them more options and enlarge their visions. Former generations didn't enjoy such colorful worlds. Their understanding of the outside is limited and monotonous."" ""Society views us as wanting to be different, wanting to be full of personality and full of individuality and wanting to be creative in not a good way,"" said Lin Li, an 18-year-old student at Fudan University in Shanghai. ""We see the society as our enemy a little bit. We do not want to be so conventional because we think all of these things are old and especially in China we need some big changes. Maybe we want to take this responsibility even though we might not have a really clear goal or aim for the future,"" she said. The impact the post-90s will have in China in the future as they mature into adults and become employees is the question many are now asking. Some have already begun to trickle into the workforce, specifically in factories, a number of which have experienced strikes in recent months by young, rural workers unwilling to accept the low wages and poor working conditions of the past. According to Yu, the strikes can at least partially be attributed to the ""jelly generation"" (another term used to describe the post-90s) and their laissez faire, independent and entrepreneurial attitude towards life. ""They are more picky about where they work,"" Yu said. Don Tapscott, author of ""Grown Up Digital: How the Net Generation is Changing Your World"" believes the post-90s generation are  much more entrepreneurial than their elders. ""Yes, they will effect change, and yes, they have a completely different culture than their parents,"" said Tapscott. ""What happens online does materialize. It does drive behavior change in the real world.""","Tech-savvy youth of China have become an increasingly studied demographic .

"Editor's note: CNN.com has a business partnership with CareerBuilder.com, which serves as the exclusive provider of job listings and services to CNN.com. (CareerBuilder.com)  -- Work can't get much worse than when it stinks -- literally. For Stephen Viscusi, work stinks everyday. ""I work near an executive (woman) that does work out at lunchtime,"" Viscusi says. ""She returns smelling like body odor and Chanel No.5. It doesn't cut it."" Rather than let his co-worker continue smelling up the office, Viscusi, author of ""On the Job: How to Make It in the Real World of Work,"" took the high road and told his colleague she had a small problem. He says the sheer embarrassment motivated her to not only shower, but not to take it personally or hold a grudge. ""Never be afraid to confront annoying co-workers head on,"" Viscusi says. ""Remember they are peers, not the boss."" There's (at least) one annoying co-worker in every office. Whether it's the chatty-Cathy, smelly-Steven, tag-along-Tammy, or just ""that guy,"" difficult co-workers (unfortunately) are the standard in the workplace -- not the exception. Most difficult co-workers are oblivious to their nightmare behavior. Avoiding them is out of the question. If you do make a comment, they stare at you like you're from the moon. Your feelings have been building up for months -- maybe even years -- and it's time to do something about it. You can either pull your hair out over their obnoxious behaviors -- or, you can deal with them accordingly. Define the Problem (aka ""Co-worker"") In ""The Worst Case Scenario Survival Handbook: Work"" (Chronicle Books), Joshua Piven and David Borgenicht describe four possible types of co-workers. The Talker...  just won't shut up; engages in long-winded, one-sided conversations on relatively trivial subjects; and always has something to say about something (or someone). The Kiss-Up... craves approval mostly from the boss, but will also seek approval from you. The TMI (Too Much Information)... has no boundaries and no shame. He/she will share every piece of unpleasant and personal information with you, without sparing a detail. The Gossip... much like the TMI, will share any and every story -- as long as it's not theirs. Carly Drum, a workplace etiquette expert with New York-based executive search firm Drum Associates, offers these tips if a co-worker is annoying you: . Tip No. 1: Take a break. When you are spending more than 40 hours per week indoors with the same people, something is bound to bother you, Drum says. ""Everyone is going to have some sort of mannerism that bothers you, whether they crack their gum too loud or just hold their pen wrong."" Drum says. Step outside for a breath of fresh air or run out to get a cup of coffee, she suggests. ""It's human nature to get bothered by the little things, so just accept it and take a break!"" Tip No. 2: Be mentally tough. Don't let another colleague's bad habits hurt your concentration and productivity at work. Drum suggests ignoring him or her as best you can and limiting your daily interactions with them. ""If career advancement is important to you, then always try to act professionally in the workplace regardless of what an annoying co-worker might do,"" Drum offers. Tip No. 3: Discuss the problem with your co-worker. (... In a non-judgmental, non-confrontational way of course...) Drum agrees with Viscusi that you shouldn't be afraid to say something to your co-worker. Depending on what the behavior is that's bothering you, it never hurts to approach your co-worker for a friendly little chat, Drum says. ""Co-workers sometimes don't notice they are doing something really annoying because it's just by habit,"" Drum contends. ""By saying, 'I don't know if you noticed but... (insert issue here)' -- a reasonable co-worker will usually be receptive to your feelings."" Tip No. 4: Talk with your supervisor. If the friendly and polite one-on-one doesn't work (or turn out to be so friendly), another option is to bring up the issue with your supervisor. ""From a managerial perspective, a difficult employee who is insensitive to other co-workers can poison a workplace environment and severely impact inner-office morale,"" Drum says. ""Effective supervisors know how imperative it is to nip problems like this in the bud as soon as they arise."" E-mail to a friend . Copyright CareerBuilder.com 2009. All rights reserved.

"(CNN) -- Members of Mexico's security forces were involved in the forced disappearances of more than 140 people during the country's offensive against drug cartels, a human rights group says. A report published Thursday by Human Rights Watch paints a dim portrait of Mexican military and police forces, which the group says sometimes acted in conjunction with organized crime. Vanishing victims: The 'open wounds' of Mexico's drug war . Of the nearly 250 specific cases of forced disappearances that the human rights group reviewed from 2006 to 2012, security forces are implicated in at least 149, the report said. An accounting of the country's war against drug gangs -- put into high gear by former President Felipe Calderon and inherited by President Enrique Pena Nieto -- reveals ""disastrous results,"" the human rights organization concluded. ""President Pena Nieto has inherited one of worst crises of disappearances in the history of Latin America,"" Jose Miguel Vivanco, the organization's Americas director, said in a statement. Mexican Mother's Day march spotlights search for missing . The report focused on Calderon's time in office, and argues that his single-mindedness in fighting the powerful drug cartels led to an increase in human rights violations by officials. And the specific cases of forced disappearances the group investigated are just the tip of the iceberg, it said. In the northern state of Coahuila alone, officials reported nearly 2,000 disappearances between 2006 and 2012. Calderon wasn't the first to use the military to aid police in the fight against the drug cartels, but he ramped up the offensive and made it a centerpiece of his administration when he assumed office in 2006. At the time, drug violence was spiraling out of control in some parts of the country, and there were fears the government was losing authority to the criminal groups as they branched out from smuggling into other organized crime. A number of the country's most wanted drug traffickers were arrested or killed during Calderon's administration, but the overall level of violence continued to rise, peaking in 2011. Read more: Misconceptions about Mexico . Statistics indicate that violence may be declining. In 2012, there were 20,568 homicides across the country, an 8.5% decrease from 2011. But the number of critics of Calderon's offensive continue to swell. During his tenure, more than 47,500 drug-related deaths were reported before the government stopped releasing updated figures in early 2012. Human Rights Watch estimates the figure to be more than 60,000 deaths. The organization first investigated the issue of rampant human rights violations by the military -- including forced disappearances -- in a 2011 report. Thursday's report says the dozens of cases reviewed show that all of Mexico's security forces -- the army, navy and police forces at the federal, state and local levels -- are connected to forced disappearances. Read more: Why is Mexico drug war being ignored? The report is especially a black eye for Mexico's navy, which is responsible for bringing down some of the top drug lords and is considered the most incorruptible of the military branches. But a concentration of disappearances using the same tactics, around the same time period, and in the same area, indicate the navy may have had a plan to commit abductions, the report claims. There is evidence that more than 20 people in Coahuila were arbitrarily detained by navy personnel in a two-month span and never heard from again, the report says. ""The common modus operandi in these cases suggests that these crimes may have been planned and coordinated, or at the very least could not have taken place without the knowledge of high-ranking navy officials,"" the report states. Blame also falls on Mexican prosecutors, who do poor jobs of investigating disappearances, often times mishandling evidence or not following up simple leads, the report says. Read more: Mexico's invisible women . Military officials did not immediately comment on the report, but in the past have said that it keeps in constant contact with Mexico's National Commission on Human Rights, and that less than 2% of complaints have resulted in action by the commission. Human Rights Watch challenged the Pena Nieto administration to bring those responsible for the abuses to justice. The organization also highlighted the success of the state of Nuevo Leon, where the government has partnered with victims' groups to fully investigate such disappearances. ""At first, both sides were distrustful,"" the report states. ""However, when prosecutors -- motivated by families to investigate and held accountable when they did not -- began to genuinely look into the crimes, they gradually began to win back the trust of the victims' relatives. And families, in turn, began to collaborate more openly with prosecutors.""","A new Human Rights Watch report criticizes Mexican security forces .

"KERALA, India (CNN) -- Mata Amritanandamayi is known as the ""hugging guru."" Some days, she will sit for up to 20 hours straight as tens of thousands of devotees line up to feel her embrace and hear her whisper motherly advice. Mata Amritanandamayi, aka the ""hugging guru,"" embraces everyone she meets in an effort to spread love and healing. Followers come from all over the world to Amma's ashram, or spiritual center, in Kerala, South India, to get a hug; many choose to stay. ""There are two types of poverty in the world, financial poverty and the poverty of love; the second is more important,"" says Amritanandamayi, who goes by Amma, which means ""mother"". Amma grew up poor, in the same seaside village on the southern tip of India where she built her ashram. Villagers believed she could cure sick cows. As a young girl, she was known to take what little food her own family had and share it with others. Although Amma shies away from describing herself as psychic or magical, some followers think she is divine. ""I have only one feeling,"" says Navaratnama, a young girl from Mangalore, who traveled 11 hours on a train to see Amma. ""That I have touched God."" Navaratnama says she hopes to become pregnant and decided to make the journey to Kerala after Amma appeared to her in several dreams.  Followers flock to Amma's hugs » . Amma greets her followers with a steady gaze and a smile; she listens to their concerns or sometimes just hugs them. Many are too emotional to speak. On a typical weekend day, some 30,000 followers visit the ashram to feel her embrace. Amma says her message to each person she meets is love. ""I want to awaken motherhood in both men and women,"" Amma says, referring to selfless love. ""Motherhood is something that is fast disappearing from the world."" Roughly six months each year, Amma leaves her ashram and travels the world, holding meetings in hotel ballrooms in major cities in the United States, Europe and South America. From these places, she gathers even more devotees, many of whom visit her ashram in India as volunteers. Gautam is a fair-haired, freckle-skinned 31-year-old from California who has been living at the ashram for eight years. Before Amma renamed him, he was known as Brian Harvey and worked at Yahoo. ""Before I met Amma, I think it was the typical American lifestyle of living for myself, trying to make myself as comfortable as possible,"" Gautam says. He was attracted by Amma's emphasis on selfless service to others, he says. Gautam now dresses all in white and works for free as one of Amma's aides. He has even picked up the local language, Maylayalam. The ashram is mix of foreigners and locals working side-by-side. They send out Amma's newsletters, serve guests in the cafe (one for Western food, one for Indian food) and organize the thousands of visitors who come for a day, a week or several months. Roughly 80 percent of India's 1.1 billion people are Hindu. The religion's rituals vary, but generally they are performed by male priests and consist of offerings of sweets, incense, fire and flowers. Amma's ashram is rooted in the Hindu tradition, but not tied to it. Here you will find female priests conducting ceremonies in the temple. A picture of Jesus hangs in Amma's private quarters. Visitors of all denominations are welcome. Amma has no formal education, and her philosophy is not of the intellectual kind. She teaches love of neighbor as a means to self-fulfillment and peace. Service, rather than study, is the focus of her work. Unlike many Hindu gurus, Amma does not preach any particular spiritual practice, such as yoga, meditation or chanting. ""Fundamentally, what everyone needs is mental strength and self-confidence, to manage the mind just as we manage the outside,"" she says. An Indian newspaper reported that Amma's income was around $80 million last year, although her representatives would not confirm this figure. The money comes from private donations and the sale of books and CDs. Much of this money is in turn given away to help the poor or the those affected by natural disasters. Amma has donated millions of dollars to help the victims of the tsunami in South Asia and Hurricane Katrina in the United States. She also runs a series of homeless shelters in 38 American cities. ""I have no desires, no pleasures,"" she says. E-mail to a friend .","Mata Amritanandamayi's religion is rooted in Hinduism but not tied to it .

"Williamsburg, Iowa (CNN) -- Florida Republican Senator and possible presidential hopeful Marco Rubio told CNN he believes that the nurse who was quarantined in New Jersey is a ""hero."" In an interview in Williamsburg, Iowa, Rubio said Kaci Hickox is ""someone that went abroad and was willing to literally put her life on the line in the service of her fellow man."" Hickox is in a public spat with New Jersey Governor Chris Christie over her 65-hour mandatory quarantine after returning from West Africa, which she argues was unnecessary. There is a dispute between state officials and Hickox about whether she was showing symptoms that required quarantine. Rubio, a potential rival of Christie's for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, was careful not to criticize the New Jersey Governor's actions, saying he does not know all the details. ""I can only say that at the end of the day if in fact she was showing symptoms, I know there was some dispute about whether or not those symptoms were real, but the fact that she was showing symptoms there is a public health need to address that and protect the general population,"" Rubio said. Several leading Republicans and GOP candidates have also called for a travel ban from West Africa to fight the spread of Ebola to the United States. Rubio said he doesn't think that would be effective, and instead will introduce legislation when the Senate returns to work next month to stop new visas from being issued for people traveling from countries where the Ebola epidemic is severe. Christie on possible Ebola lawsuit: 'Whatever' ""We should not be issuing new visas to citizens of those counties until such time as Ebola in those nations have been brought under control,"" Rubio said. Still, Rubio is taking a more cautious approach than other politicians when it comes to balancing public fear and scientific reality of the disease. ""I think its important to be aware about it and act urgently to address it, I don't think we should panic about it, I don't think we can solve any problem through panic,"" Rubio said. ""We're honored by the fact that so many Americans are willing to travel there and help assist in this effort because the most effective way to deal with Ebola is to stop it at its source there in west Africa,"" he said. Rubio spent the day campaigning with Senate GOP hopeful Joni Ernst, who is in a neck and neck race with Democrat Bruce Braley. Republicans are counting on picking up this vacant Democratic seat to help take control of the Senate in next Tuesday's election.","Sen.

"(CNN) -- A day after Rand Paul said the Republican Party's brand ""sucks,"" the chairman of the Republican National Committee politely described the first-term senator as someone who's ""a real tip of the spear when it comes to challenging our party about growth."" Reince Priebus made the comment Thursday evening while co-hosting a conference call with Paul to College Republicans, according to a post by Red Alert Politics that was tweeted out by Priebus. ""Our brand does suck,"" Paul said on the call, stressing a need to expand the party's base. ""We aren't the cool club, we're the club that seems to be against everything."" He said Republicans are starting to head in the right direction and added the GOP's leaders were not to blame for the party's optics problems that have accumulated over time. For his part, Priebus stressed that students are the ""future"" of the Republican Party, adding that the GOP plans to be ""focused like a laser"" on reaching out to young people in the coming years. It's part of the RNC's overall rebranding effort to expand its base and appeal to more women, young people and minorities. Sean Spicer, an RNC spokesman, responded to Paul's ""sucks"" remark earlier Thursday, saying on MSNBC that the Republican Party has ""a ways to go"" to expand its base, but argued that it's trying.

"(CNN) -- NASA announced an ambitious slate of launches Wednesday aimed at putting new eyes on the Earth and its atmosphere in 2014. A total of five missions -- three satellites and two instruments that will be mounted on the International Space Station -- are scheduled to go into orbit between February and November, the U.S. space agency said. They'll measure carbon dioxide in the air, water in the soil, rainfall, cloud layers and ocean winds, providing ""immediately useful"" readings that will help improve both short-term weather forecasts and and long-term climate projections, said Michael Freilich, the director of NASA's Earth Science Division. ""This tremendous suite of five new instruments and missions that will be launching this year will truly reinvigorate our observing system and expand it,"" Freilich said. The launches come two years after the National Academy of Sciences warned that budget pressure, program delays and launch failures had left scientists facing a ""rapid decline"" in Earth observations as the U.S. satellite fleet aged. NASA had called that 2012 report ""overly pessimistic."" Freilich said Wednesday that six more missions were ready to launch by the end of the decade, including satellites that help measure the dynamics of the polar ice sheets and measure human use of water in aquifers. The first of this year's planned launches, the Global Precipitation Measurement Core Observatory, is set for February 27. The satellite will be launched from Japan in a joint venture with that country's space agency, NASA said. A second satellite, the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2, is slated to go up in July from Vandenberg Air Force Base, in California. Its mission is to monitor the levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide blamed for rising global temperatures -- a controversial notion politically, but one accepted as fact by most scientists. The first OCO mission crashed into the sea in 2009 after failing to reach orbit. And in November, NASA hopes to launch its Soil Moisture Active Passive satellite, designed to produce high-resolution maps of water in the soil. That can help track droughts and improve the productivity of farmland, the agency says. Meanwhile, the two missions headed for the space station will be carried aloft by the private space contractor SpaceX, which began flying commercial cargo missions in 2013. The ISS-RapidScat, which will record ocean winds -- important data for marine forecasts, hurricane tracking and climate research -- goes up on a SpaceX mission June 6. The Cloud-Aerosol Transport System, which uses laser instruments to track small particles in the atmosphere, is scheduled for launch September 12. The Obama administration's recent decision to support the space station through 2024 has had ""a powerful enabling influence,"" said Julie Robinson, NASA's chief scientist for the ISS. The decision adds four years to the station's planned lifetime -- an important step when it can take up to three years to develop a new instrument, she said. Unlike other Earth-science satellites, the station passes over different points on Earth at different times with each orbit. But while it lacks that consistency, it's also up to 400 km (250 miles) closer to the planet, Robinson said. ""When you're a little closer, you can see things in more detail,"" she said.

If you're prepared to throw down a huge markup, you can just walk out the door. Outside both the IFC and the other Hong Kong island location, there are legions of iPhone ""flippers,"" lined up and brazenly selling their wares for 20% to 30% more than the official retail price. Two-phone limit . While the quota enforces a two-phone limit per customer, resellers use proxies -- sometimes domestic helpers or laborers -- to buy up the phones for a small fee, meaning there are plenty of ""gray-market"" iPhones for those willing to pay a premium. They sit on cheap plastic chairs with their open suitcases beside them, stacked up with white boxes. Most of them have handwritten cardboard signs with the phones they have available. The prices, though, are nowhere to be seen; they'll tap it into a calculator when you ask how much the phones are going for that particular day. I ask one couple sitting next to a stack of about 10 phones, about 50 meters away from the IFC store, how much a 128GB gold iPhone 6 Plus is. HK$9,600 ($1,238), he tells me. Inside the store, if you're lucky enough to make the quota, the same phone would be a shade over HK$8,000 ($1,032). I ask him where he got it, and he points with his thumb over his shoulder at the giant Apple logo. The Apple employee tells me that it's a risk to buy a phone from a reseller; if it wasn't originally purchased in the city, it won't be covered for warranty here. But despite the warning, it seems that most of the flippers' inventory is sourced just meters away. Back outside, the reseller's own phone rings: a beat-up white iPhone 5 or 5S, covered by a yellowing case. He answers it, clearly not convinced of a sale, so I turn to his partner and ask whether I can get a discount. She jabs a new price into a calculator: HK$9,580, a saving of just $20 ($2.50). Watch: People are paying $3,000 for this iPhone . It's not like I don't have much choice of dealer. There are another five or six guys lounging around nearby, smoking and chatting near their own stacks of brand new, boxed-up phones, but the prices seem to resist too much market fluctuation. I ask another the cost of an identical phone; he quotes me HK$10,000 ($1,289). At the nearest MTR -- Hong Kong's subway system -- stop there's another couple sitting with a Jenga-style assortment of iPhone boxes. They're not selling, explains Winnie, a secretary who's using her lunch break to do some iPhone transactions. They're buying, and as we speak, she hands over her old iPhone 5. She gets HK$1,100 ($142) for it, which she'll put toward an iPhone 5S from the Apple Store. ""I don't care too much about having the latest model,"" she says as she heads over to buy it. It's the same scene as the IFC location in Causeway Bay, one of Hong Kong's major shopping districts, if not even more blatant. Apple customers have to pick their way through the 30 or so resellers who are lining the sidewalk directly outside the Apple Store's glass doors. Legal trade? The iPhone flippers have their cardboard signs propped up against suitcases and cardboard boxes, from which iPhone boxes spill. One woman even has a couple of LG boxes mixed in there. What they're doing isn't illegal, a nearby police officer tells me. It's just consumer-to-consumer aftermarket sales. ""Just like if I was to sell something to you,"" he adds. And Apple's own security, who patrol the street in black polo shirts, can't do anything about the flagrant reselling right outside their store. ""They're on public property,"" the officer says. ""So they can't get them to move."" The suspicion is that a lot of these phones end up on the other side of the border, in mainland China, brought across either by tourists or by the resellers. While iPhones have legitimately been on sale there since October 17, demand continues to outstrip supply, justifying the additional 20% to 30% markup. As always in this city, money is talking. And increasingly, it is an affluent class of Chinese citizen who is willing to pay over the odds. Locals are being forced out of the property market, education costs -- as well as competition for school places -- are on the up, and people say that despite stagnation of wages, daily costs continue to rise. So for Apple and cashed-up mainlanders, it's a win-win. Those left in the cold are the Hong Kong citizens who want to get their hands on a new phone the legitimate way. With the quota system swamped each day from 8 a.m. sharp, it might be a long wait for that new 6 Plus.","iPhones sell for significant markups in Hong Kong .

"(CNN) -- Machines have surpassed humans in physical strength, speed and stamina. What would happen if machines surpassed human intellect as well? The question is not just hypothetical; we need to start taking this possibility seriously. Most people might scoff at the prospect of machines outsmarting humanity. After all, even though today's artificial intelligence can beat humans within narrow domains (such as chess or trivia games), machine brains are still extremely rudimentary in general intelligence. Machines currently lack the flexible learning and reasoning ability that enables an average human to master any of thousands of different occupations, as well as all the tasks of daily life. In particular, while computers are useful accessories to scientists, they are very, very far from doing the interesting parts of the research themselves. But this could change. We know that evolutionary processes can produce human-level general intelligence, because they have already done so at least once in Earth's history. How quickly engineers achieve a similar feat is still an open question. By 2050 we may, according to a recent survey of leading artificial intelligence researchers, have a 50/50 chance of achieving human-level machine intelligence (defined here as ""one that can carry out most human professions at least as well as a typical human""). Even a cursory glance at technological development reveals multiple paths that could lead to human-level machine intelligence in this century. One likely path would be to continue studying the general properties of the human brain to decipher the computational structures it uses to generate intelligent behavior. Another path would be the more mathematical ""top-down"" approach. And if somehow all the other approaches don't work, scientists might simply brute-force the evolutionary process on computers. Regardless of when and how we get there, the consequences of reaching human-level machine intelligence are profound, because human-level machine intelligence is not the final destination. Machine intelligence would reach a recursive tipping point after which the design and improvement of such intelligence would no longer be in human hands. The next stop from human level intelligence, just a short distance farther along the tracks, is machine superintelligence. The train might not even decelerate at Humanville Station: It is likely instead to swoosh right past. This brings us to what I think may well be the most important task of our time. If there will eventually be an ""intelligence explosion,"" how exactly can we set up the initial conditions so as to achieve an outcome that is survivable and beneficial to existing persons? In ""Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies,"" I focus on the dynamics of an intelligence explosion; what will happen if and when we gain the ability to create machine superintelligence? This topic is largely ignored and poorly funded. But we must keep at it: How could we engineer a controlled detonation that would protect human values from being overwritten by the arbitrary values of a misbegotten artificial superintelligence? The picture that emerges from this work is fascinating and disconcerting. It looks like there are major existential risks associated with the creation of entities of greater-than-human intelligence. A superintelligence wouldn't even need to start with a physical embodiment to be catastrophically dangerous. Major engineering projects and financial transactions on Earth are mediated by digital communication networks that would be at the mercy of an artificial superintelligence. Placing an online order for an innocent-looking set of advanced blueprints or fooling its creators into thinking it is benign could be an initial step, followed by the possibility of permanently altering the global biosphere to pursue its preferences. The control problem—how to engineer a superintelligence to be safe and human-friendly—appears to be very difficult. It should be solvable in principle, but in practice it may not be solved in time for when the solution is needed. The difficulty is compounded by the need to get it right on the first try. An unfriendly superintelligence would not permit a mulligan. Remember HAL from ""2001: A Space Odyssey""? Let's try to avoid that. If we could solve the technical problem of constructing a motivation system that we can load with some terminal goal of our choosing, a further question remains: Which goal would we give the superintelligent A.I.? Much would hinge on that choice. In some scenarios, the first superintelligence becomes extremely powerful and shapes the entire future according to its preferences. We want an A.I. that is safe, beneficial and ethical, but we don't know exactly what that entails. Some may think we have already arrived upon full moral enlightenment, but is is far more likely that we still have blind spots. Our predecessors certainly had plenty -- in the practice of slavery and human sacrifice, or the condoning of manifold forms of brutality and oppression that would outrage the modern conscience. It would be a grave mistake to think we have reached our moral apogee, and thus lock our present-day ethics into such powerful machines. In this sense, we have philosophy with a deadline. Our wisdom must precede our technology, and that which we value in life must be carefully articulated—or rather, it must be pointed to with the right mathematics—if it is to be the seed from which our intelligent creations grow.","Nick Bostrom: What would happen if machines surpassed human intellect?

"(CNN) -- A quick tweet or Facebook post could put you behind bars in the Philippines under a new cyber law, according to activists. The Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 came into effect Wednesday despite widespread protests among netizens, journalists and free speech activists. ""Reaction has been overwhelming. This is quite unprecedented,"" said Carlos Conde of Human Rights Watch in Manila. ""I haven't seen this kind of uprising from the online community in the Philippines. This is a setback for one of the most social-media savvy countries."" The Philippines had a steadily rising 28 million internet users in 2011, approximately 30% of the population, according to the World Bank, placing it among the top 20 nations for internet use. Before the law came into effect, the Philippines was ranked the most ""free"" in Asia, according to the 2012 Freedom House report on internet freedom. The Philippines ranked sixth globally, after the United States, Australia and other European nations. The new law addresses an array of content and computer-related offenses, including cybersex, child pornography, unsolicited commercial communications and identity theft. The act also states that there will be ""special cybercrime courts manned by specially trained judges to handle cybercrime cases."" Critics of the law, who are calling it the ""new martial law online,"" are against a provision that criminalizes libel. ""The law is so vague in many respects; it is being interpreted in many ways -- comparing 'liking' something on Facebook to an investigative exposÃ© -- the law has to be clear,"" Conde said. ""It's almost like an afterthought -- the libel portion was put there haphazardly."" Existing libel laws of the Philippines were dubbed ""excessive"" by the United Nations in October 2011. Local news organizations and civil rights groups mobilized to file a petition against the law, which they believe ""establishes a regime of cyber authoritarianism."" The petition has sought a restraining order against enforcement of the new law. ""You never know what's going to trigger these libel offenses...[the law] goes against overall freedom of press and expression. It is motivated by personal experiences -- they don't like what you say and then you are penalized for it,"" said Gayathri Venkateswaran of the Southeast Asian Press Alliance. Other points of the new law have been contentious, such as the ""take-down"" provision, which enables the Department of Justice to order removal of defamatory content without due process. The Philippines government, in a statement, acknowledged the questions over the ""constitutionality of certain provisions of the Act"" but also called on ""critics of the cybercrime Act to speak out against online vandalism and bullying with as much vigor and passion as they expressed in their objections to certain provisions of the law."" The new law ""is quite good ... except for the item on libel,"" said Jacques DY Gimeno, a contributor to the Freedom House report. ""At least the government is now dealing with cybercrime. ""Self-censorship will go up, internet users will have a sense of needing to police themselves,"" she added. On the future of the cybercrime law, Gimeno said, ""It will probably be modified because it is so unpopular. People are taking note of the legislators who voted for the law; to pacify voters they will amend to mask the actual intention.""","A new tough law on cybercime came into effect Wednesday in the Philippines .

"(CNN) -- In 1948, a new word appeared in the vocabulary of South Africans, destined to symbolize racial oppression the world over. That word was apartheid, used to describe a policy of segregation and discrimination that aimed to keep blacks and whites apart in every sphere of life. The Afrikaner-dominated National Party had won a narrow election victory in 1948, and used the word apartheid in a policy statement to describe its segregation program. The policy divided the South African population into four distinct racial groups -- white, African, colored and Asian -- and a plethora of laws were passed to institutionalize the apartheid system. The Population Registration Act required all South Africans to register with the government according to their race. Interracial sex and marriage was prohibited, and each of the racial groups was required to live separately. Other laws segregated South Africans in buses, taxis, trains, hotels, restaurants and waiting rooms. Mandela: Anti-apartheid icon and father of modern South Africa . The Communist Party also was outlawed, and the government defined membership so broadly it could arrest people indiscriminately, branding them Communists. Nelson Mandela, who has died at age 95 after years of health ailments, was born in 1918 in a South Africa where segregation of black and white was already on the statutes. The son of a tribal chief, he grew up in a rural community in Eastern Cape where the color of his skin designated him a second-class citizen under law. Blacks had subpar job opportunities . In the years following the creation of the Union of South Africa in 1910, legislation came into force making it a criminal offense for blacks to break a labor contract, and which restricted them to unskilled or semi-skilled jobs. The Natives Land Act of 1913 separated South Africa into areas in which either blacks or whites could own land. Blacks, constituting two-thirds of the population, were restricted to 7.5% of the land. Whites, making up one-fifth of the population, were given 92.5%. It took Mandela a lifetime of struggle, including 27 years of imprisonment, to undo legislation that denied Africans basic freedoms enjoyed by the descendants of white European colonists. Opinion: What made him great . A man who played a major part in transforming apartheid from an election slogan into an adopted practice was Hendrick Verwoerd, a senator in 1948 and prime minister in 1958. He was assassinated in 1966 by a colored parliamentary messenger and was succeeded by John Vorster, who as minister of justice had orchestrated the government's campaign to crush internal resistance. Several measures were taken in the 1960s to put the theory of apartheid into practice. Under the provisions of the Group Areas Act, urban and rural areas in South Africa were divided into zones in which members of only one racial group could live, and all others had to move out. In practice, it was blacks that had to move, often under threat or use of force. Between 1963 and 1985, approximately 3.5 million blacks were sent to the homelands, where they added to the already critical problem of overpopulation. Most of the homelands were economic and political disasters. Documenting apartheid . By the late 1970s, the National Party began to believe that reforms should be introduced to appease domestic and international critics. In 1978 Pieter W. Botha, Vorster's successor, and his administration applied a mixture of carrots and sticks. It repealed bans on interracial sex and marriage, desegregated many hotels, restaurants, buses and trains, and removed the reservation of skilled jobs for whites. But the Botha reforms stopped short of making any real change in the distribution of power, and black resistance continued. In 1983, Botha's government proposed that political power be shared among whites, coloreds and Indians, with separate houses of parliament for each racial group. This proposal caused angry opposition within the National Party and 16 members were expelled. But a new constitution came into place in 1984, with P.W. Botha as the first state president. Most blacks strongly condemned the new constitution. Rather than viewing it as a major step towards reform, they saw it as another step to bolster apartheid. Government reforms began in mid-1980s . In January 1986, Botha shocked conservatives in the all-white House of Assembly with the statement that South Africa had ""outgrown the outdated concept of apartheid."" Botha suffered a stroke in 1989 and resigned as party leader. F.W. de Klerk was elected to succeed him for a five-year term. The miracle years . De Klerk recognized the urgent need to bring the black majority into the political process, and most party moderates agreed with him in principle. But he surprised his supporters by announcing, on February 2, 1990, the impending release of Nelson Mandela, who walked to freedom nine days later at the age of 71. De Klerk continued reforms by rapidly repealing a number of laws first introduced to bolster the apartheid system, and the irreversible progress towards democracy had begun. By the end of 1993, Mandela, de Klerk and the leaders of 18 other parties endorsed a new interim constitution to take effect immediately after South Africa's first election of universal suffrage. Under this constitution all citizens over 18 were enfranchised, the homelands abolished, and the country was divided into nine new provinces. On April 27, 1994, the first elections open to all South African citizens were held, and Nelson Mandela was subsequently unanimously elected president by the new parliament. Mandela introduced housing, education and economic development initiatives designed to improve the living standards of blacks. He established the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate human rights abuses during apartheid, and in 1996 he oversaw the enactment of a new democratic constitution. After a landslide ANC victory in 1999, he handed over the reigns of power to Thabo Mbeki. South Africa since apartheid .","South African apartheid policy was instituted in 1948 .

"(CNN) -- Germany's industrial sector is known for its efficiency. Its automotive industry is among the most successful in Europe, and stands as the third largest in the world. But with an aging population, the country is struggling to meet the demand for a skilled workforce which can continue to propel manufacturing forward. Cue the ""Factory of the Future"", a 17,000 square foot innovation hub in the city of Chemnitz where researchers experiment with new technologies and machinery in a bid to improve the production process. Developed by scientists at Fraunhofer Institute for Machine Tools and Forming Technology in Saxony, the factory is particularly committed to rethinking the role of humans in manufacturing lines. ""The processes we are developing today are so much more complex,"" says Professor Dirk Landgrebe, director of the institute. ""The machines and resources are so much more sophisticated that we will need qualified people to handle these processes in the future,"" he adds. Virtual training . To ensure future workers are fully prepared, the lab has created a state of the art virtual environment where potential employees can test out the new technologies and intelligent systems that are set to form the building blocks of German industry. Employees enter a 3D room which can take on the appearance of a factory or even a piece of equipment. By using a controller, the advanced technology detects head motion, adapts to movement and changes the user's view accordingly. Funding innovation . Fraunhofer Institute, the brains of the ""Factory of the Future"" operation, is part of the 70 institutions committed to researching and developing new ways to enhance Germany's industrial landscape. The German government is also involved in funding work that will eventually form the infrastructure of German production. ""Our task at Fraunhofer is to bring as much of our research as possible straight into industrial production,"" says Matthia Putz, director at Fraunhofer Institute. ""We don't focus on reports, we develop new products and new technologies together with industrial partners,"" he adds. Germany's manufacturing industry has long held the standard for innovation, and even though it has faced challenges, it looks like ""The Factory of the Future"" may keep the country from losing its edge.","Germany's industry is among the most successful in Europe .

"(CNN) -- It was a difficult choice: the apple pie or the New York-style cheesecake? Both sat in front of me, looking succulent on separate plates, on the counter at Liberty Pies & Cakes in Madrid. I pushed my coffee aside to study this opportunity. We were in the middle of filming a report about Burton Novack, an American expat in Madrid whom you might call an unusual entrepreneur. In the midst of Spain's economic crisis, he opened a shop two years ago to make and sell American-style pies and cakes. Unusual because he's an octogenarian. He looks pretty fit. He says he still plays tennis. He certainly still drives because I took a ride in his car from the shop to his office, where I met his large parrot. ""I said, 'why don't I go after that making apple pies and cherry pies and things like that. Of course I really didn't know anything about how to do it,' "" Novack said. Read more: Spain's tourism boom keeps troubled country partying . But he knows about business. He built a successful engineering firm over decades, with projects for the nuclear power and automotive industries, among others. His oldest son now runs Liberty Pies from a sleek office in central Madrid, which also serves as the pie firm's administrative hub. The company is nearly making a profit, even as 200,000 small businesses have closed in the crisis. Novack isn't the typical young entrepreneur the Spanish government aims to help with a new law to make it easier to open a business. Watch more: Spain is betting on exports . But even without the help, the pie shop has created seven jobs, in a nation with soaring unemployment. Novack says job creation is the way to economic recovery. His key hire seems to be a veteran pastry chef who formerly worked at an American-style pie shop in Madrid that closed years ago. The chef, David Mota, demonstrated in the kitchen how his small team -- an assistant chef and a kitchen aide -- prepare the crusts and fillings for the pies. Novack insists they can make just about any kind of fruit pie. Read more: Europe's politicians tackle unemployment . ""The labor market has been squeezed so tight,"" Novack said, ""they (the government) have to find a way to give work to the people because if the people don't have any money, there's little they can buy."" ""Of course, in a moment when things are like this,"" Novack added, ""even restaurants are wanting to offer something that will attract the attention of their clients and our products do."" Sixty five percent of the desserts are sold and delivered to upscale restaurants and hotels. Novack personally convinced each of these big clients, and we went along for the pastry delivery to the Hotel AC Aitana on Madrid's main boulevard. ""We improve our buffet with the pies,"" said Hugo Vazquez, food and beverage manager at the hotel, ""because the American guests try to find American products in Spain."" His shop, in northern Madrid, is decorated with images of Hollywood icons like Marilyn Monroe and Kirk Douglas, along with bright red restaurant stools and other furniture made in St. Louis, Missouri, where Novack was born. Novack plans more expansion, even while he's worried about his own waistline. ""I should be fatter because I taste and eat a lot of pies and cakes,"" Novack said. Which brings us back to my choice. Clearly, I wouldn't be able to have an objective opinion about the apple pie or the cheese cake unless I tried them. So for the sake of the story, I dug in. Research is research. And it persuaded me that American-style desserts can come out quite well, even when prepared far from their normal settings. Novack politely interrupted our conversation to take another call on his mobile phone. He says he's just lined up 10 more hotels to take his pies. Despite the economic crisis, his phone keeps ringing.","Liberty Pies & Cakes founder Burton Novack says job creation is the way to economic recovery .

"(CNN) -- Echoing outrage seen in the streets of Indian cities after a deadly gang-rape in New Delhi, protesters in India's northern neighbor Nepal are also demanding their government take action over violence against women. For almost two weeks, demonstrators across Nepal have chanted slogans and massed outside official buildings, including the prime minister's residence, demanding better protection of women and criticizing what they describe as the government's delayed response to issues such as rape and abuse. Some protesters in Nepal credit the Indian protests with bringing the issue of women's safety to wider attention. Read more: Is this the start of India's 'Arab Spring'? In India, the angry demonstrations after the gang-rape and subsequent death of a 23-year-old woman have prompted initial changes -- such as increasing the number of women working in New Delhi police stations and official pledges to strengthen laws regarding rape and assault. ""The media attention to protests in Delhi has raised awareness on issues of violence against women in Nepal,"" said Manju Gurung, of Pourakhi, an organization that advocates for female migrant workers. Read more: New Delhi rape exposes the perils of being a woman in India . Public uproar began on social media after Nepalese news reports alleging that a police officer had raped a migrant worker. Calling the movement Occupy Baluwatar, named for the upscale neighborhood where the prime minister's residence is located, the campaign moved to the streets where hundreds gathered. Some demonstrators carried signs that read, ""Why are you silent?"" and ""End domestic violence and abuse against women."" Their outrage focused on several cases of alleged rape and abuse against women, including that of the migrant worker, whom they refer to as Sita Rai. ""This case is representative of several others that go unreported,"" Gurung said. ""Sita took the courage to speak up, but it is difficult for a woman in our society to reveal such incidents of abuse."" Opinion: India's rape problem needs a rewiring of society's attitude . On November 18, the woman returned home to Nepal on vacation from Saudi Arabia, where she works as a domestic worker, said Basanta Bahadur Basnet, a lawyer who represents the woman. Immigration officials at the Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu observed that she was traveling on a fake passport and kept her overnight at a detention center. Three of the officers took her savings of 8,500 riyals (about $2,300), her lawyer said. One of the airport police officers took her to a motel near a bus park where he robbed and repeatedly raped her, the lawyer said. The woman then returned home to Bhojpur, in eastern Nepal, where her family resides. ""She was persuaded by her family members to complain,"" Basnet said. In mid-December, she filed the case in Kathmandu, and it began to gain attention in Nepal around the same time as news of the gang-rape attack in New Delhi emerged. The airport police officer, Parsuram Basnet, faces charges of rape and cheating. He has appeared in court and now awaits a verdict, according to Keshav Adhikari, a spokesman for the Nepalese police. The verdict could take about five to six months but could come sooner because of the high interest in the case, according to police. Parsuram Basnet has been suspended from his job as a police officer at the airport, but he cannot be removed from his job until the verdict, said Dhiraj Pratap Shingh, a spokesman for Kathmandu District Police. The suspect maintains that the sex was consensual, said his defense lawyer, Bhola Kuma Bhattarai. Although married, he had told the woman that he would marry her, his attorney said. The defense questioned the timing of the woman's rape complaint saying, ""She filed a case so late because others told her to do so. Why would she file a case a month later otherwise,"" the defense attorney said. The remaining three immigration officers accused of robbing the woman have been suspended and are under investigation, according to authorities. The victim was given 150,000 Nepalese rupees (about $1,700) as relief, but it was not compensation, according to Bhola Siwakoti, joint secretary at the Ministry of Home Affairs. She is now receiving counseling, according to Gurung, who works with female migrant workers. ""We are pushing for female immigration officers at the airport and strict monitoring to prevent such incidents,"" Gurung said. ""Everyone has come together for the protests."" Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai has stated that he was ""deeply ashamed"" of the government officials' involvement in the incident, and has assured he would take steps against perpetrators of violence against women, according to local media reports.

"(CNN) -- In rock climbing, it's all about making it to the top - and in business, it's no different. At Brooklyn Boulders Somerville, the two worlds collide. The company's co-founders Lance Pinn and Jesse Levin talk to Smart Business about how an active collaborative workspace can stimulate innovation and creativity. CNN: How did you come up with the idea to combine physicality into the workspace? Jesse Levin: There isn't a space that really exists like the active collaborative workspace and the true benefit for people is the mixed modality, the multi-dimensionality experience. So it's not just an office space, coming in to kind of work on their idea. It's not just a rock climbing gym, it's not just a cafÃ©, it's all of these things wrapped into one. People really just do things differently, really want to have a different type of experience. So we designed a place for them to come in and if they're freelancers, if they're coders, or they're entrepreneurs; they can come in here, they can sit down on a yoga ball and do sit-ups and work at their desk or they can stand at a stand up desk and do pull ups and jam on their spread sheets and also go for a climb, take a yoga class, sit in the sauna, grab a coffee, check out the street art on the wall; you name it. CNN: The company's first facility was in New York. What made you choose Somerville, Boston as your second location? JL: In Somerville we really brought the creative entrepreneurial aspect to the forefront. And climbing unlike any other sport really attracts an incredibly diverse sub-set of people. You have artists, you have yogis, you have foodies, you have entrepreneurs, you have coders. It's a very cerebral and strategic practice. And we really wanted to kind of help people identify and have a really extroverted social experience. We layered in entrepreneurship, build, art, music and culture and really kind of created this project around the notion that physicality stimulates innovation and creativity. CNN: You're setting up a third space in Chicago. How do you think people will respond to it? JL: Because a space like this and a concept like this doesn't exist, people didn't really quite understand or know how to best utilize it, what to expect and nor did we for that matter. And that's ok, it was an experiment and continues to be an experiment with our community and our team. Some people definitely come in here and spend their entire day working out of the space. They figure out how to use it and they make it work for themselves. CNN: What separates Brooklyn Boulders Somerville from competing workspaces? JL: We'll never compete in the collaborative workspace traditional environment, that's not who we are, that's not what we're trying to do. We're really trying to experiment in a way where people can blur the lines between work, life, and play, as we like to say. In ways that they've never done it before. And the active collaborative workspace is simply one facet of that.","Brooklyn Boulders Somerville is a Boston-based collaborative workspace .

But on many issues, the candidate admits she needs to study up. But time is running out with Election Day a little more than two months away. Curtis, a Butte math teacher serving her first-term in the Montana state house, has already raised $180,000 in 10 days, according to her campaign, and sees ""people coming out of the woodwork"" to support her. According to Curtis, who spoke with CNN last week, her nomination as the Democratic Senate candidate ""came from incredible circumstance."" Curtis added that she had not even planned to seek re-election to her seat in the state legislature, let alone run for the U.S. Senate. An untested candidate . But that ""incredible circumstance"" comes with a price for Curtis and the Democrats who thrust an untested candidate into the national spotlight overnight. When asked her position on the situation in Iraq, Curtis told CNN, ""Give me a little more time."" On the border crisis, ""I'll need more time, you know only 11 days ago I was painting my storm windows."" One area the teacher had a firm answer was Common Core, the controversial national education standards opposed by teachers' unions but supported by the Obama administration. Curtis said, ""I am excited by Common Core, as a teacher ... but there has been a rush to implement it and that's the problem."" Montana State University professor David Parker concedes that ""she's clearly rough. ... It's going to take time to get her answers down to sound bite quality."" Not going to back down . But Robyn Driscoll, a Democratic Montana state senator, finds the lack of polish ""a refreshing change from the usual spin. ... Her approach tells voters she is not going to back down."" Her priorities: access to public lands, opposition to Rep. Paul Ryan's House GOP budget, and ""economic policies for the 100%, not the 1%."" Curtis, 34, has already garnered the support of the state's unions, former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean's Democracy for America and Tester, the state's two-term Democratic senator. ""As Montana's senior senator, I'll be supporting Amanda as well as all Democrats who are talking about the issues that are important to Montana,"" Tester told CNN. ""Amanda's energy and enthusiasm will be a refreshing change and will bring attention to issues facing working families like education and access to our public lands."" Tester helping out . Tester's spokeswoman Marnee Banks confirmed that he has been helping Curtis fundraise and plans to continue to make calls on her behalf. When Tester's counterpart, Max Baucus, left the Senate this year for the U.S. ambassador's post in Beijing, Montana Democrats were in a pickle. They needed a replacement. They chose John Walsh, a decorated veteran, the head of the state's National Guard and its lieutenant governor, to keep the seat blue. It was already an uphill battle in the Big Sky state against popular freshman U.S. Rep. Steve Daines, the Republican nominee. Then the plagiarism charges hit after a New York Times story detailed how Walsh lifted large parts of his master's thesis from others' work. Walsh dropped his campaign within two weeks, vowing to stay in the Senate. Little time to vet candidate . Rushing to fill the seat, they chose Curtis at a nominating convention with little time to vet her for the job. After the nomination was announced, the state Republican Party circulated a montage of Curtis's Youtube videos that catalogue her first term as a state representative. In the video, Curtis is critical of gun-rights supporters, calls herself ""an anarchist at heart,"" and explains she had to restrain herself from punching a fellow state representative who expressed anti-gay sentiments. Chairwoman of the Young Democrats of Montana Marissa Perry said the GOP is taking the remarks out of context in an attempt to smear Curtis. ""I encourage you to watch the whole thing. They are not showing the full story,"" Perry told CNN. Curtis, for her part, stands by the videos she contends are being manipulated, and encouraged voters to watch them in their entirety. ""Those videos are my public record,"" Curtis said. Conservative criticism . Conservative critics have unearthed other controversial statements and affiliations, including Curtis' association with the Industrial Workers of the World. IWW is a far left union movement that hopes to ""take possession of the means of production, abolish the wage system, and live in harmony with the Earth,"" according to its website. Her husband, Kevin, is listed as a local organizer for IWW in Montana. Phil Kerpen of the conservative advocacy group American Commitment, which first published Curtis' affiliation with IWW, told CNN, ""Plagiarism disqualified a Senate candidate, but extremist ideology, advocacy of violence, and membership in the Industrial Workers of the World results in nothing but praise for his replacement. This is what the Democratic Party has become in 2014."" Curtis campaign manager Clayton Elliot was asked about the union affiliation and criticism, but replied by emphasizing her populist approach. ""Amanda grew up in a family that struggled to put food on the table so she knows first hand the struggles of Montana working families. Unlike Congressman Daines, Amanda believes that we must put working Montana families ahead of corporate special interests,"" Elliot said. Dems see her as a net-plus . Democratic strategists see Curtis's firebrand politics as a net-plus, if not for her race, for down ballot races. They confided that before her entry into the race, liberal voters were unlikely to turn out for the Democratic ticket in an off-year. The Curtis run will change that, they told CNN. The Senate Democrats' campaign arm, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, is widely expected to lay low and not invest in the Curtis campaign, which is down double digits in the latest polling. Professor Parker thinks it increasingly unlikely Curtis will receive significant outside support ""unless she closes in on Daines in the polls and money race."" For their part, the National Republican Senate Committee is confident that Curtis won't be able to breakthrough against Daines, who has a huge advantage in name recognition and fundraising. ""Our strategy will remain internal, but it seems telling that the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is telling allies that they've given up on the race entirely,"" said NRSC spokeswoman Brook Hougesen. But Curtis backers remain upbeat. Driscoll said the GOP ""should take (Amanda) seriously"" since she raised $150,000 in the first week of her campaign ""just using social media!"" Calls by CNN to the DSCC seeking comment were not immediately returned.","A late entry into Montana Senate race, Amanda Curtis is unabashedly liberal .

"Lima, Peru -- Murder suspect Joran van der Sloot arrived Saturday at the Lima police headquarters in Peru, where he is facing charges that he killed a Peruvian woman. Van der Sloot, handcuffed and wearing a protective vest, was escorted through a news conference held by Peruvian authorities as photographers snapped photo after photo. The body of 21-year-old Stephany Flores Ramirez was found Wednesday in a Lima hotel room registered to van der Sloot, a Dutch citizen who was twice arrested and released in connection with the 2005 disappearance of American teenager Natalee Holloway in Aruba. Flores' body was badly beaten and investigators believe a tennis racquet in the room was used in the killing, Carlos Gonzalo, spokesman for Peru's Interior Ministry, told CNN. Despite reports that a baseball bat was the murder weapon, Gonzalo said there was not a baseball bat in the room. The Dutch Consulate is now involved in the case and has volunteered a defense attorney for van der Sloot, according to Carlos Neyra, a spokesman for the Peruvian Investigative Police. Gonzalo said van der Sloot has asked for his mother, though authorities couldn't confirm whether she's coming to Lima. Surveillance video from a casino on May 30 shows Flores and van der Sloot playing cards at the same table, he said. The woman won about 5,000 soles (about $1,755), though it was not found in the room or the victim's car, Gonzalo said. He said ""they found bloodied clothes with"" van der Sloot and that investigators are testing them, as well as the tennis racquet, for DNA. He added that there is no other suspect connected to Flores' death. A hotel worker is seen in a surveillance video speaking to van der Sloot as he is leaving the hotel, Gonzalo said. When investigators questioned the workers, he told them that van der Sloot told him ""don't bother my girl."" Van der Sloot indicated that he would be returning to the room, according to the worker. The hotel workers became suspicious after no one else left the room, and eventually a foul smell came from it, Gonzalo said. It wasn't immediately clear how much time lapsed between the conversation on video and workers noticing the smell. Chilean authorities delivered van der Sloot to their Peruvian counterparts on Friday in the border town of Santa Rosa, where he was greeted by hecklers and dozens of media personnel jostling for position to get a better picture of the Dutch citizen. The Dutch Consulate has told Peruvian authorities that it is not comfortable with the way van der Sloot has been presented to the media, Neyra said. The Peruvian Minister of the Interior is asking authorities not to talk about the case without his authorization. Paperwork showed that van der Sloot entered Chile the same day Flores' body was found, Chilean police told CNN. He was captured in Chile on Thursday and transported to the border to be expelled, said Macarena Lopez, a spokeswoman for Interpol. The Chileans drove van der Sloot across the border to a Peruvian police station. He made a 100-foot walk from the car to the station as journalists pushed past a police line and a handful of hecklers rained loud and angry obscenities on the suspect's head. Van der Sloot was taken inside the station for processing. From there, he was to be taken to the nearby town of Tacna and then flown to Lima. Holloway was on a high school graduation trip to the Caribbean island of Aruba in 2005 when she disappeared. Van der Sloot was arrested twice in connection with the case but released both times. He denied any involvement and has not been charged. Van der Sloot also faces an arrest warrant on charges of extortion and wire fraud in Alabama, U.S. Attorney Joyce Vance said Thursday. The charges are unrelated to the killing of the Peruvian woman and deal with an attempt to sell details about Holloway for $250,000, Vance said. CNN's Mayra Cuevas contributed to this report.","NEW: Dutch Consulate offers defense attorney to suspect .

"(CNN) -- Common opinion holds that diplomacy involves careful negotiation and an ability to bite your tongue. But what happens when the political situation in a country is so corrupt that you feel it is your moral duty to speak out? Former British ambassador to Uzbekistan, Craig Murray . Craig Murray, former British ambassador to Uzbekistan, has gained notoriety as one of the few diplomats to ignore the wishes of his government and openly criticize the country in which he was stationed. ""I was told before I went that the human rights situation [in Uzbekistan] hadn't changed much since the days of the Soviet Union, whereas in fact it had got much worse,"" he says. ""Nothing had prepared me for the sheer level of brutality and the sheer level of subjugation of the people."" Central Asia's most populous country, Uzbekistan has been ruled by President Islom Karimov since the nation broke free from Soviet rule in 1991. Karimov is democratically elected but the elections have been labeled unfair by independent observers. Two cases of torture that were brought to his attention propelled Murray to speak out. In the first incident he was introduced to a man who told him that his grandchildren had been tortured in front of him in a bid to coerce him into signing a witness statement that would implicate two of his nephews as members of al-Qaida -- falsely, Murray claims. Shortly afterwards he received an envelope of photographs of the body of Muzafar Avazov, who had died at Jaslyk Prison, a notorious detention center in north western Uzbekistan. His body had been delivered back to his mother in a sealed casket. She was ordered to bury the casket the next day without opening it but she felt there was a religious duty to clean the body before burial. When she saw the condition of the body she took detailed photographs and sent them to Murray. ""I sent the photos on to the pathology department of the University of Glasgow,"" explains Murray. ""The pathologist's report said that his fingernails had been pulled out, he'd been beaten about the face and neck and he died of immersion in boiling liquid. He'd been boiled alive."" Murray says he has come across only one other case of complete immersion in boiling liquid but numerous cases of limbs being inserted in boiling water and that ""rape, suffocation and electrocution"" is exacted on ""thousands of people every year."" Murray's claims are corroborated by respected NGOs. In a report titled ""Nowhere to turn: torture and ill-treatment in Uzbekistan"", published last month, Human Rights Watch concluded that torture is ""endemic to the criminal justice system"" in Uzbekistan. ""It is not a marginal problem caused by a handful of errant police or security agents but is practiced by police and security agents on a regular basis,"" said the report. The nature of these cases so disturbed Murray that in October 2002 he made a speech to fellow diplomats and Uzbekistani officials at a human rights conference in Tashkent in which he criticized the regime and highlighted the ""prevalence of torture in Uzbekistani prisons."" The speech had been approved by the UK Foreign Office but behind closed doors it was met with arched eyebrows. Uzbekistan had become an important strategic ally in the ""war on terror"". The Karshi-Khanabad airbase loaned to the U.S. gave them easy access to Afghanistan during the 2001 invasion and the Foreign Office was keen to maintain a relationship with Karimov. Murray was recalled to London for a reprimand. Later, while on holiday in Canada he was again summoned to London where he was served with 18 disciplinary charges, including accusations of ""hiring dolly birds"" to work in the visa department, having sex in his office with local girls in exchange for visas and drinking on the job. Murray did not aid his cause by beginning an affair behind his wife's back with a 23-year-old English teacher turned lap dancer, Nadira Alieva. He makes no secret of his taste for the good life; none of the charges levied against him held up in a tribunal. He was exonerated but the stress of the ordeal brought on a mental breakdown. He recuperated and returned to Tashkent but on landing suffered severe back pains and was airlifted back to London with a pulmonary embolism in his lung. He was eventually removed from his post in October 2004. In a statement the FCO told CNN: ""The FCO's handling of this case has been scrupulously fair throughout, and entirely in accordance with its obligations as an employer, including its duty of care. Mr. Murray was withdrawn from post because it was considered that he was no longer able to perform effectively the full range of duties required in conduct of our relations with Uzbekistan. ""He was subsequently suspended from duty on full pay pending investigation of whether there were disciplinary issues to answer. That investigation was put on hold on medical advice until the uncertainties over his health were resolved: thus it was not concluded. Mr. Murray then opted to apply for early severance under the terms of the FCO scheme to reduce its staff numbers, and we accepted that application."" Craig Murray does not believe that open criticism of regimes would hamper delicate negotiations with despotic governments. Standing up to dictators often elicits more respect than a timid word in their ear, he says. ""The idea that it is impossible to conduct diplomatic relations except by fawning and by showing a respect that you do not feel towards countries which behave very badly indeed doesn't help at all."" There is an argument that diplomats are part of a more far-reaching international governmental strategy where their job is to keep the lines of communication open with despotic regimes and that the role of blowing the whistle on human rights abuses is already fulfilled by NGOs and journalists. But Murray argues that this does not apply in a country such as Uzbekistan where most of the NGOs have been expelled and local journalists risk imprisonment, torture and death if they speak out. ""Sometimes you find yourself in a position where you are actually the only person in a position to speak out against a totalitarian regime,"" he says. In Uzbekistan, his concerns appear to have become reality. The US ceased its effective alliance with Uzbekistan in 2005, nominally due to a massacre in May in Andijan where several hundred civilians were shot dead at a protest, but in reality, claims Murray, because Karimov had switched allegiances and formed a military partnership with Russia. He continues to speak out; he recently published a book about his experiences, ""Murder in Samarkand -- A British Ambassador's Controversial Defiance of Tyranny in the War on Terror,"" which is scheduled to be made into a film by the director Michael Winterbottom, and he continues to write and give talks on the subject. Craig Murray may now speak out from the cold but it is apparent that he believes that his stance has achieved significantly more than he would have in twenty years of quiet diplomacy.","Craig Murray gained notoriety by openly criticizing the country where he was stationed .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Violent and predatory pirates are ""totally out of control"" according to experts; but what can be done to solve the problem? Held hostage: The crew on the merchant vessel ""MV Faina"" are among 286 being detained by Somali pirates. It's the question that major trading nations, navies and shipping companies are all battling to answer as luxury yachts, large freighters and even competitive race boats face unprecedented levels of piracy. As of December 5, a staggering 286 crew members aboard 14 vessels were still being held captive by pirates after a significant flurry of attacks that started in July this year. The center of pirate activity has been the Arabian Sea, east of Africa. The majority of this year's pirate attacks have occurred in the Gulf of Aden region, particularly the waters off the coast of Somalia. The number of hostages taken in the nine months to the end of September is more than triple the amount taken in the same period last year. While many attacks have focused on trading vessels, luxury yachts have not been immune. Among the victims was French yacht ""The Ponant,"" which was hijacked by Somali pirates in April and 30 crew were taken hostage. Michael Howlett, assistant director of the International Maritime Bureau, said the number of pirate attacks was ""totally out of control... and totally unprecedented."" There have been 101 reports of ships being attacked by pirates, including 40 hijackings, 34 cases of ships being fired upon, with over 800 crew members being affected, he said. Howlett told CNN the pirates are hard to stop due to a lack of effective authorities in Somalia, limits in terms of how patrolling navies can act, and the vast expanses of water in which the pirates are operating. ""Because there is no real deterrent they are acting with complete disregard for everyone else,"" he said. For cruising yachties in the area, the piracy problem has meant a dramatic rethink of plans. Many cruisers cross the Gulf of Aden when heading towards the Mediterranean in February and March -- however, it appears that in 2009 these sailors may not be as free to make the journey. As a result of the piracy sailors on one popular discussion site appear to be turning away from the area completely. ""The pirates have evolving tactics, and the situation changes often enough that what works today may not tomorrow. There is no absolute defence other than not sailing there,"" one sailor advised another. So, how can this situation be remedied? According to Howlett, the long term solution is a stable, functioning and effective government in Somalia. ""We need an effective government in Somalia ... and what we really need is a coordinated response. Somalia can't do it without its neighbors and the international community,"" Howlett told CNN. Because most of the pirates are operating from Somalia, they need to have their supply lines and support networks cut off there, he continued. In the shorter term, solving the problem, or at least minimizing it, depends upon the actions of the navies patrolling the area. ""The only effective parties are the navies. We would like them to play a bigger part, particularly engaging in some pre-emptive targeting. ""What we need to do better is make it more difficult using co-ordinated attacks. There needs to be more robust rules of engagement,"" Howlett said. Without the ability to launch pre-emptive strikes, the naval vessels must wait until something happens until they can act, and even then they are limited in what they can do. ""It's really because their rules of engagement don't allow them to be involved at the moment,"" he said. Still, the maritime community greatly appreciates the work of coalition, U.S. Navy, NATO, French and Yemeni coast guard vessels that were helping to deter some would-be attackers. United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) Somalia spokesman, Peter Smerdon agreed that further naval assistance would be a huge help in the area. The WFP in Somalia had been under threat with pirate attacks a serious danger for shipments of food into the impoverished country. However, Smerdon said the WFP had now secured the services of European Union (EU) naval vessels to escort them into the area for one year. ""We don't foresee that the piracy issue is going to go away very quickly -- so this is excellent for us."" Smerdon told CNN that if pirates were to affect the flow of food aid into the country it could spark a massive humanitarian crisis. The WFP was currently feeding about 1.7 million Somalian people every month and was aiming to increase that to 2.4 million per month, he said. However, even with increased naval efforts, the attacks would still be hard to prevent due to the range of water pirates cover, Howlett said. Over on the west coast of Africa, in the waters off the coast of Nigeria, frequent attacks by pirates are causing similar concerns. In the first nine months of 2008, there were 24 piracy incidents in Nigerian waters, according to the most recent IMB piracy report. However, as the report noted -- it is believed attacks are seriously under-reported in Nigeria which is a ""cause for great concern."" Another major issue is whether ransom payments should be paid. While a South Korean shipping company decided to pay one of the ransoms requested, others have refused to -- citing the likelihood it would encourage more attacks. Howlett said there was currently no set policy for ransoms, as it was a difficult area to deal with. ""Nobody wants to pay the ransom, but it's tricky because if you don't pay the ransom then you won't get your ship back."" Howlett said the piracy problem could also have a significant impact on the world economy if it is not addressed quickly. ""We are already starting to see a number of larger shipping operators re-routing their ships via South Africa. This will be a lot more expensive and the incurred costs will get passed on to the consumer,"" he said. In a recent interview provided to CNN, a pirate leader claimed attacks onshipping would continue so long as life in Somalia remained desperate. ""The pirates are living between life and death,"" said the pirate leader, identified by only the name, Boyah. ""Who can stop them? Americans and British all put together cannot do anything,"" he said. For now, Howlett said shipping operators and recreational boaters needed to take caution through the area -- or avoid it if possible.","More than 280 crew members are still being held hostage by pirates .

"(CNN) -- A Peruvian police report leaked Monday says the alleged victim of Joran van der Sloot was found in his hotel room on the floor, half-dressed. The report provides new details about the hours before Stephany Flores' body was found. Van der Sloot, who was twice arrested in connection with the disappearance of Alabama teen Natalee Holloway in Aruba in 2005, is in Peruvian custody as a suspect in the killing of Flores, 21. According to the document, the Hotel Tac, where van der Sloot was staying, received a call from someone looking for him about 11 p.m. June 1. The receptionist forwarded the call, but no one answered. The hotel worker assumed that van der Sloot was asleep because the room key was with him and not the front desk. About an hour later, according to the police report, the receptionist noticed that van der Sloot owed money for two nights and went up to his room, where her knocks went unanswered. The television was blaring, so the hotel employee figured he was resting, the report says. Afterward, the hotel supervisor told the employee to go back to van der Sloot's room and enter using a spare key. When the employee went in, she found Flores' body on the floor, dressed in a black T-shirt and red panties, half-covered with a piece of white clothing, the police report said. Flores was bleeding from her nose, the report said. The hotel employee became frightened at the sight and went to alert her supervisor and the police, turning off the television and lights on her way out of the room, the report said. In Session's Jean Casarez and CNN's Mayra Cuevas contributed to this report.","Police report says Stephany Flores found half-dressed .

"(CNN) -- He's known as the ""Merchant of Death"" and the ""Lord of War,"" -- an alleged international arms dealer straight out of a cloak-and-dagger spy novel who eluded authorities for years and inspired Hollywood villains. But in reality, according to those who have seen or met Viktor Bout, he is a somber man, sometimes nattily dressed, a wheeler-dealer who has insisted he is innocent of the allegations leveled against him. Bout, a Russian citizen and former military officer, speaks six languages ""and I could see him bargaining in all six at the same time,"" wrote CNN's Jill Dougherty in 2008, recalling her meeting with Bout in 2002 in Moscow, Russia. Bout arrived in New York late Tuesday after being extradited from Thailand. He faces charges in the United States of conspiring to kill U.S. nationals, conspiring to kill U.S. officers or employees, conspiring to acquire and use an anti-aircraft missile and conspiring to provide material support or resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization. American law enforcement officers have spent years pursuing him, and the extradition process from Thailand was an arduous one for them. Bout is accused of supplying weapons to war zones around the world, from Sierra Leone to Afghanistan. Before his 2008 arrest, U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents led a sting operation by posing as members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), officials said. ""His early days are a mystery,"" said Douglas Farah, a senior fellow at the International Assessment and Strategy Center who co-authored a book on Bout. Farah told Mother Jones magazine in 2007 that according to his multiple passports, Bout was born in 1967 in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, the son of a bookkeeper and an auto mechanic. A pro-Bout website -- Farah said Bout put it up himself -- says he was born into an ""average home and an average family"" and that his parents were employees in the ""administrative and accounting fields."" But, Farah said, some reports are that Bout's parents were involved in intelligence. ""His mother was supposedly very high in the KGB,"" Farah said, adding that Bout has consistently denied that. ""He graduated from the Military Institute on Foreign Languages, a well-known feeder school for Russian military intelligence, and is known to have a true gift for languages,"" Farah told Mother Jones. Bout has said that he worked as a military officer in Mozambique. Others have said it was actually Angola -- which would make sense, as Russia had a large military presence there at the time, Farah told CNN. He said Bout's rise stemmed from the end of Communism and the rise of capitalism in the early 1990s in the former Soviet bloc. ""He was a Soviet officer, most likely a lieutenant, who simply saw the opportunities presented by three factors that came with the collapse of the USSR and the state sponsorship that entailed: abandoned aircraft on the runways from Moscow to Kiev, no longer able to fly because of the lack of money for fuel or maintenance; huge stores of surplus weapons that were guarded by guards suddenly receiving little or no salary; and the booming demand for those weapons from traditional Soviet clients and newly emerging armed groups from Africa to the Philippines,"" Farah told the magazine. ""He simply wedded the three things, taking aircraft for almost nothing, filling them with cheaply purchased weapons from the arsenals, and flying them to clients who could pay."" ""He knew the African market,"" Farah said Wednesday. ""He was clearly aware of who [Russia's] past clients had been ... I think he had foresight, and I think he understood the world changes much more than the average Soviet bloc person."" He first became known when the United Nations began investigating him in the early-to-mid 1990s and the United States began to get involved, Farah told CNN. Bout's website, which spells his name Victor, says he became notorious because of a smear campaign, ""fictitious tales and stories which were generated from one source -- a corrupt United Nations contractor who was generously paid for the U.N. contracts he arranged with the help of others for Victor's companies, and then became mad for vengeance when Victor refused to continue paying him."" The site said the United States case against him is based on ""lies"" and paid informants. Attempts by CNN to contact Bout's wife were unsuccessful Wednesday. Ironically, the United States is also among Bout's clients, even indirectly, Farah said Wednesday. Bout companies were used to fly for government contractors in Iraq. Most of those flights -- estimated in the hundreds -- occurred after then-President George W. Bush had signed an executive order making it illegal to do business with Bout because he represented a security threat to the United States, Farah told Mother Jones. ""The State Department, under a congressional inquiry initiated by Sen. Russell Feingold, found it had used Bout companies, acknowledged it, and stopped,"" Farah told the magazine. ""...Despite the public revelation, the congressional inquiry, the executive order and a subsequent Treasury Department order freezing the assets of Bout and his closest associates, the flights continued for many months, at least until the end of 2005."" The United States did not have the airlift capacity to go in at the time, Farah said Wednesday. But Bout had planes close by, in the United Arab Emirates, and ""he was willing to fly without insurance. He paid pilots a flat rate."" At one point, the State and Treasury departments were going after Bout while the Department of Defense continued to pay him. ""It was one of those contradictory situations,"" Farah said. Farah told CNN he believes the trial against Bout will be quick, as he doesn't believe anyone wants Bout to tell what he knows -- because he knows a lot. His knowledge could potentially embarrass not only Russia, but the United Nations, the United States and Britain, among others, he said. ""I don't think they're going to have a wide-ranging free-for-all."" And so far, ""he's apparently been a stand-up guy to the Russians,"" and hasn't threatened to turn on them, Farah said. For one thing, they have his family, which is ""considerable leverage"" -- Bout is widely known to be a family man, Farah wrote in August in Foreign Policy magazine. ""He endured more than two years in a Thai prison, losing more than 70 pounds and never showing any signs of doubting he would ultimately walk away,"" Farah wrote in the article. ""He has been, so far, a soldier's soldier."" That's largely in line with how Bout views himself, Farah said Wednesday -- as a soldier and a businessman. ""I think everyone agrees on a personal level, he's very charming. He's very articulate, very sort of well-mannered and obviously a very smart guy,"" he said, adding Bout has never considered himself as a ""trigger-puller or bad guy."" ""I don't think he views himself as having any blood on his hands,"" he said. In addition, Bout approached the CIA and the FBI through an intermediary just after the September 11, 2001 attacks on New York and Washington, offering to help oust the Taliban if paid tens of millions, Farah told Mother Jones. ""Negotiations were serious and lasted several months, but we do not know what, if any, parts of the deal he offered were accepted."" But in 2002, when he met with Dougherty, Bout was interested in setting the record straight. He traveled with a bodyguard and a female aide, Dougherty said, and was ""dressed in a well-cut dark jacket with gold buttons, grey trousers, white shirt and basket-weave-patterned silk tie."" He also sported a wool topcoat. ""His English was quite good,"" Dougherty recalled. ""He seemed intelligent, canny; serious but nervous."" She said he was ""tall, heavy-set, a bit rough around the edges, but he acted like a man who has been wronged."" She asked him about allegations against him -- did he sell arms to the Taliban? To al Qaeda? Did he supply rebels in Africa and get paid in blood diamonds? -- and he denied each one. ""It's a false allegation and it's a lie,"" he said. ""I've never touched diamonds in my life and I'm not a diamond guy and I don't want that business."" ""I'm not afraid,"" he told Dougherty. ""I didn't do anything in my life I should be afraid of. And all this looks to me like a witch hunt. Look, I'm coming to your office, I have no problem. And I said, 'Hey, who's looking for me?' I'm here. I'm not hiding from nobody. And I don't want this story going on."" Dougherty asked him if he had ever met Osama bin Laden, and he said no, adding that if he had, he might have helped prevent the 9/11 attacks. Farah believes Bout's downfall was insisting on closing the supposed ""deal"" with FARC himself.

The show will be based on the UK variety show ""Saturday Night Takeaway."" Harris has been plain about his desire to host a variety show. The onetime ""Doogie Howser"" and ""How I Met Your Mother"" actor, who's impressed audiences with his turns on Broadway (in ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"") and on TV awards shows (he'll be hosting the Oscars next year), told Howard Stern of his hopes earlier this year.

Instead, he pitched a variety show to the network. CBS head Les Moonves was interested, Harris said at the time. New York magazine said that a number of networks were bidding for Harris' services, and NBC won. There was no timetable given for when the show might debut. Harris told New York that he's looking forward to the challenge, since he's a big fan of ""Takeaway."" The UK show involves games, celebrity guests and pranks. ""As I watched the show, I couldn't stop smiling. Now that I've seen many seasons, my face hurts. It's a game changer,"" said Harris.

"(CNN) -- Growing up, Joshua Paul Hawkins didn't have many role models. Hawkins lived in what he calls a ""very broken home"" as a child in Las Vegas. His parents got divorced when he was 8, and he described the atmosphere in the house as filled with ""anger and sadness."" However, he knew there was one thing he could count on: Batman. He felt a bit like a loner, just like the character of Bruce Wayne, whose alter ego Batman first appeared on newsstands in ""Detective Comics"" #27 on March 30, 1939, and would be reinvented through countless movies, TV shows and books for the next 75 years. (Time Warner is the parent company of DC Comics, the same as CNN.) Readers were captivated by the story of how Bruce, heir to a vast fortune, witnessed his parents' murder at the hands of a mugger. As he grew older, Bruce was driven by vengeance and decided one night to take on the form of a bat to ""strike terror"" in the hearts of criminals. ""Being a child that young and watching your parents split up is a very harrowing experience,"" said Hawkins, now 26 and living in Seattle. ""And in my head, the only way I could make any sense of it was likening it to being like Bruce Wayne when he lost his parents to something senseless and tried to find something good to bring out of it."" Despite the chaos at home, he could always rely on the 1989 ""Batman"" film making it all better. And after the 1992 animated series premiered, he came home every day, eagerly awaiting the show. ""It was a pure joy with me after every episode feeling inspired to keep going on the path I was going even if those around me didn't understand my way of doing things."" An inspiration to generations of people . In the 75 years since it began, the character of Batman has inspired many fans, young and old, in some cases because of a strong identification with the character. Hawkins says he would have been a very different person if not for Batman, and that those emotions could have manifested themselves another way. He is a writer, creating stories that he hopes will inspire others just as Batman's did. ""Had Batman not given me the compass of justice, I may have been nothing more than a punk kid who bullied kids for how they looked or what they did or for whatever I fancied at the time,"" he said. ""I wouldn't have gotten such good grades because I wouldn't have cared about school. And I may have even fallen into that dark place of feeling so angry and taking an unsavory means of trying to end what plagued me."" There is truly something universal to how people identify with Batman, said producer Michael Uslan, who has been involved in every ""Batman"" movie since 1989. Uslan describes Batman's superpower as ""his humanity"": ""When you see a young boy whose parents are murdered before his eyes ... he sacrifices his childhood in the belief that one person can make a difference, that he will get all the bad guys even if he has to walk through hell for the rest of his life,"" he explained. ""That is an origin story that not only transcends borders but transcends cultures."" ""Batman"" comic book writer Scott Snyder put it this way: ""He suffers a tragedy as a boy, and uses that tragedy as motivation to become a hero capable of preventing the same thing from happening to another child in Gotham City. There's something deeply inspiring in that."" Young people identify with the Caped Crusader . Andrea Letamendi, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist and scientist, has studied Batman for years and notes that many young people can identify with his problems. ""Nearly three-quarters of youths have been exposed to at least one trauma by the time they hit adolescence,"" she said. ""Childhood resiliency is also quite impressive -- only a fraction of youths who experience traumatic stress actually develop long-lasting mental health problems. We don't all put on a cape and cowl, but we are amazingly strong in the face of adversity."" Feelings of isolation and intense loneliness have plagued retail worker Dusty Lane for his whole life. The Nashville resident said he often keeps people at a distance and has problems letting them get close. He finds himself deep in thought on many occasions, much like Bruce Wayne, but he also channels it into something positive. ""He's encouraged me to become a deep thinker, sharpen my wits, and truly believe in strong moral principles,"" Lane said. He remembers a dramatic scene from the 1990s ""Batman"" animated series in which Robin confronts his parents' killer and attempts to kill him. Batman tells him not to let his emotions get the best of him. ""Before I ever make a decision out of anger that I would come to regret, I always hear that voice in the back of my head saying 'You can't let your emotions get the best of you.' "" Lane firmly believes that role models can have a major influence over how one lives their life, and he says he picked the right one in Batman. 'Batman helped me find my voice' Eli Vizcaino's problems growing up were quite different, but Batman helped him as well. He grew up with a speech impediment. As a child, he had to practice with a speech therapist in the mornings, then practiced reading in the afternoons after school. Once he opened up a Batman comic book, he immediately became a fan and became more interested in reading out loud. ""Batman helped me find my voice,"" he said. The character continued to be a big part of Vizcaino's life when he would move to different parts of the United States and switch schools. ""During these periods of transition, I would always have a period of intense loneliness before I would make friends and during this time, Batman would be there to help through that time,"" said the Austin, Texas, resident. It's no wonder that children battling adversity -- such as cancer survivor Miles Scott, who got to be ""Batkid"" in San Francisco in November as part of his Make-a-wish project -- see the brave and fearless Batman as their favorite hero. ""Batman turns weakness into strength,"" said Travis Langley, a professor of psychology at Henderson State University in Arkansas and a fellow Bat-fan. ""Bruce Wayne took his own childhood fears and made something better out of them."" Hawkins could not agree more. ""Batman really touched me. He inspired me. He helped me. And to this day I have a sense of justice and decency.""","Batman celebrates his 75th birthday on Sunday .

"(CNN) -- A Massachusetts child rape suspect is wanted in connection with cross country spree of sexual assaults, kidnappings and armed robberies, police said. Gregory Lewis, 26, allegedly committed at least six sexual assaults in various states since fleeing Massachusetts in September, according to the Massachusetts State Police. Several victims in the latest assaults were women he arranged to meet at local hotels through online escort services, police said. The victims were handcuffed, threatened with a gun, robbed and sexually assaulted. Lewis may have been in the Columbus, Ohio area as recently as Sunday, police said. He also was spotted the day before in Indianapolis, Indiana, where he allegedly committed a robbery at a hotel and was captured on surveillance video. Lewis went on his alleged crime spree along his trip west and then circled back east, police said. He was spotted in Denver, Colorado; Portland, Oregon; Boise, Idaho, and Salt Lake City; Utah during the month of October, authorities said. One alleged victim in Colorado, told CNN affiliate WCVB that Lewis is desperate. ""My message to everybody is that he is extremely dangerous,"" she told the station, asking to remain anonymous. ""He hurt me in a very traumatic way. He is going to continue to hurt anyone he comes across in a traumatic way. He told me that if anyone contacts authorities on him ever, he will make it his life's mission to come back and find us."" Lewis was arrested August 5 and charged with raping a 14-year-old girl in Southbridge, Massachusetts, police said. He was accused of four felony child rape charges, along with counts related to home invasion, kidnapping and firearms possession. The suspect was released on bail after his initial court hearing and ordered by the court to wear a GPS monitoring bracelet. On September 15, he cut off the bracelet, left it in the front yard of his young victim's home and fled Massachusetts in a 2004 Jeep Cherokee, police said. The Jeep, with Massachusetts plate number of 85GF63, is blue, with fog lights in the front and alloy rims. After fleeing Massachusetts, Lewis first traveled to Charlotte, North Carolina, where he allegedly kidnapped, assaulted and robbed a woman on September 23, police said. The alleged victim, who spoke with CNN affiliate WSOC over the phone, said she met him on the Plenty of Fish dating website. ""He put me in a choke hold and put handcuffs on me with my hands behind my back and said I'm not going to hurt you. I just want your money,"" she said. Two days after the North Carolina assault, police said, Lewis returned to his family's home in Massachusetts, where he allegedly beat and robbed his stepfather. ""This gentleman was literally shackled and held in the home, with a metal shackle,"" Southbridge Police Chief Daniel Charette told CNN affiliate WCVB. Southbridge Police Detective Sgt. Carlos Dingui said Lewis handcuffed his stepfather to prevent him from calling police. Lewis left Southbridge with his stepfather's Beretta 9mm semiautomatic handgun, according to Dingui. He also took approximately 200 rounds of ammunition. Lewis has been place at the top of the Massachusetts State Police's Most Wanted List. He is considered armed and dangerous. Anyone with information on his whereabouts should call the Massachusetts State Police Violent Fugitive Apprehension Section at 1-800-KAPTURE.","Gregory Lewis, 26, is wanted in a violent crime spree spanning several states .

"(CNN) -- Severe weather brought damaging winds across much of eastern North Carolina, officials said Friday evening. ""It's dark, rainy and dangerous, and the roads are flooded,"" Julia Jarema, a North Carolina Division of Emergency Management spokeswoman, told CNN. Numerous tornado warnings and watches were in effect for Beaufort, Edgecombe, Greene, Halifax, Martin, Pitt and Wayne counties over the course of Friday afternoon and evening, the National Weather Service warned. There were unconfirmed reports of tornadoes. ""There are no reports of any injuries in any of the counties,"" said Jarema. Tornadoes, hail and high winds may break out in the central and southern Plains this weekend before moving eastward into the Mississippi River Valley and Southeast early next week. There's a slight risk of this severe weather Saturday in south Nebraska, central and east Kansas, west Texas and most of Oklahoma, CNN meteorologists reported. On Sunday, there's a moderate chance of that weather in northeast Texas, southwest Arkansas and southeast Oklahoma. Little Rock, Arkansas, for example, has a 70% chance of severe thunderstorms Sunday night, with 1 to 2 inches of rain possible, according to the National Weather Service.

"(CNN) -- Health problems prevented Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez from coming to Caracas for an inauguration ceremony Thursday, but throngs of supporters swore an oath of loyalty in his absence. Thousands of red-clad Chavez supporters packed the streets around the presidential palace for a symbolic swearing-in for the president's fourth term. Read more: Venezuelan court says inauguration day delay for Chavez is OK . Chavez, 58, is undergoing cancer treatment in Cuba and has not made a public appearance since doctors operated on him a month ago. On Thursday, Vice President Nicolas Maduro called on the masses gathered to take an oath of ""absolute loyalty to the leadership of Comandante Hugo Chavez."" Read more: Chavez will not be sworn in on inauguration day . ""I swear by the Bolivarian constitution that I will defend the presidency of Comandante Chavez in the street with reason, with truth and with the strength and intelligence of a people who have been liberated from the yoke of the bourgeoisie,"" Maduro said. The crowd repeated his words, holding thousands of tiny copies of the constitution up in the air. Many waved flags and carried photos of the ailing president. Before he left for Cuba for surgery last month, Chavez said he wanted Maduro to assume the presidency if he becomes incapacitated and called on voters to support him at the polls. Read more: As Chavez battles cancer, Maduro waits in the wings . Thursday's rally came as authorities continue to reassure Venezuelans that Chavez's government remains unified and intact just days after announcing that Chavez wasn't well enough to be sworn in on Thursday, specified by the constitution as inauguration day. The country's Supreme Court on Wednesday handed a victory to Chavez's party, which had argued that the president did not need to be present at his swearing-in for his next term to begin. But several key questions remain: How long will Chavez be in Cuba for cancer treatment? How dire is his medical situation? And will simmering political tension about who's running the country boil over? Read more: With Chavez ill and inauguration near, uncertainty reigns in Venezuela . Maduro didn't provide specifics about Chavez's health condition Thursday but said he was still ""in battle."" ""From here we say, 'Comandante, don't worry, continue your battle. Here there is a Bolivarian government and a revolutionary people supporting you,'"" Maduro said. In the rally, which lasted for hours and was broadcast on national television, thousands of Chavez supporters waved signs, chanted and sang. State television showed one supporter toting a handmade sign with a picture of Chavez next to a painting of Jesus. ""We came to support our president,"" said Marbelys Pena, a resident of Venezuela's Bolivar state who came to Caracas for Thursday's rally. ""We really need him and we want him to get better."" Speaking from behind a podium that said ""We are all Chavez,"" Latin American leaders and close allies of Venezuela pumped up the crowd with speeches praising the president and his political ideology. ""The issue of the health of brother Chavez is a problem and a worry not just of Venezuela, but of all the anti-imperialist, anti-capitalist people,"" Bolivian President Evo Morales said. ""Soon, soon, he will return to lead this revolution,"" Morales said, drawing cheers from the crowd. Uruguayan President Jose Mujica offered more somber words of encouragement. ""There is a man who is battling for his life, and he is in your hearts. ... But if he is not here tomorrow, unity, peace, and work,"" he said. Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega described political opponents of Chavez as ""vultures"" who were hoping for the Venezuelan president's death and aiming to destabilize the country -- an accusation many speakers made at Thursday's rally. Opposition politicians have argued that delaying Chavez's swearing-in without designating a temporary replacement leaves no legitimate leader in charge of Venezuela. Chavez allies, including a majority of lawmakers in the country's congress, have said he should remain in power while taking the time he needs to recuperate. Venezuela's Supreme Court backed the government's position, ruling that Chavez begins a new term on Thursday and can be sworn in later before the court. Last week, a government spokesman said Chavez was battling a severe lung infection that has caused respiratory failure. His condition remained unchanged, the government said in a statement Monday. ""Treatment has been administered permanently and rigorously, and the patient is supporting it,"" the statement said. While reports from CNN affiliate Globovision included discussions of political uncertainty Wednesday, state television broadcasts showed presidents and foreign ministers arriving in Venezuela, walking on a red carpet at the airport as soldiers stood guard. Meanwhile, Venezuelan opposition leaders called on officials from other countries to cancel their plans to attend. Henrique Capriles, who lost to Chavez in October's presidential election, said he had reached out to foreign ministries to ask them not to send representatives. ""They are trying to put presidents from the Americas in a political rally,"" he said.

"Washington (CNN) -- The convenience store near my house is where I first became aware of the problem. There, an overweight girl, maybe 10 years old, had just persuaded her mother to buy her potato chips and a Slurpee. It was 11:15 at night. From that moment forward, I saw overweight and obese kids everywhere: At church, in Wal-Mart, at the movies. Everywhere. It wasn't always this way. In fact, obesity rates for kids have tripled over the last three decades, according to a widely circulated report that appeared in the Academic Pediatrics journal late last summer. Moreover, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and nonpartisan government surveys say that one out of every three children in America is overweight or obese. Think about that: One in three. (The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention uses body mass index -- a formula that considers height, weight, age and gender -- to determine if a child is overweight or obese. Click here for an interactive calculator to see if your child falls into either category.) Studies find that overweight and obese kids are more likely to grow up to be overweight and obese adults. Saddled with heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure and myriad other preventable health problems, they will be sicker and may die earlier than the generation before them. Consider this: Last November, a report based on the research of Dr. Ken Thorpe, a noted Emory University health care economist, found that 43 percent of all adults in America would be obese -- not overweight, but obese -- by 2018 if current trends continue. It was 15 percent in 1980. This epidemic not only threatens the well-being of our children but strains an overburdened health care system, hampers the productivity of our workforce and indirectly undermines our competitiveness as the world's leading economic power. Fortunately, there is reason to hope. First lady Michelle Obama is stepping in to lead a new initiative. Having gotten her daughters settled into school and life in Washington, the Harvard-educated lawyer is kicking off a program to bring attention to the childhood obesity epidemic. In terms of need and potential impact, I would argue that this is the most meaningful public service effort taken on by a first lady since Nancy Reagan's ""Just Say No"" campaign of the 1980s. Perhaps learning from early missteps of her husband's administration, Mrs. Obama is consulting members of Congress from both political parties before announcing the national effort. She has solicited their thoughts and ideas to incorporate into the plan. The first lady is using unifying and uplifting language to talk about the epidemic. She has refused to speak about it in abstract terms and does not disparage those who make unhealthy decisions for their kids, like the mom at that convenience store. She uses her own experiences to relate to other parents: . ""It wasn't that long ago that I was juggling a full-time job with the round-the-clock role of being a mom. And there were plenty of times when after a long day at work, when the fridge was empty and everyone was hungry, that I just ordered that pizza, because it was easier. Or we went to the drive-through for burgers, because it was quick and cheap. And I wasn't always aware of how all the calories and fat in some of the processed foods I was buying were adding up,"" she said, previewing her initiative in a speech to the nation's mayors last month. On Tuesday, the first lady will unveil the details of her comprehensive plan, the broad outline of which, she told a meeting of key members of Congress and the Cabinet, include four main elements: increasing the number of healthy schools; increasing the amount of physical activity children receive; improving accessibility and affordability of healthy foods; and empowering consumers and families to make healthier food choices. She'll spell out the details in the coming days. The childhood obesity epidemic is the newest front in the battle of the bulge, and Mrs. Obama should be praised for using her mass appeal to shed light on it. She is right to argue, as she has, that there is no one solution, federal or otherwise. Stopping this epidemic will require complementary efforts that bring together government, families, schools, foundations, businesses and others. Here's hoping that people across America hear Mrs. Obama's call to action and join the national campaign to end childhood obesity. Our collective future, in no small part, depends on its success. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Anthony Coley.","Anthony Coley says obesity rates for kids tripled in past 30 years; one in three affected .

"(CNN) -- When police arrested Eric Frein, accused in the death of a Pennsylvania state trooper, they symbolically used the equipment of their fallen brother, Cpl. Bryon Dickson, to take Frein into custody. They drove the suspect in Dickson's police vehicle, put him in Dickson's handcuffs, took him to the barracks where the shooting occurred, and held Frein there until he was moved to the correctional facility in Pike County. This drew some immediate attention. Some have questioned if these customs constitute the law enforcement equivalent of taunting, possibly prejudicing the arrest and evidence. Others might criticize the expenditure of government resources for purely symbolic gesturesâ€”like transporting an ordinary pair of handcuffs great distances, when a pair of local zip-ties could do the job. So, should we discourage these law enforcement traditions? The legal verdict? Nah. Let the police do this. And that's coming from a criminal defense attorney. Using a fallen comrade's equipment to bring in a suspect is hardly new. It's been going on for years, though I could find little information about the origin of this department ritual. Is using a slain officer's cuffs tantamount to a public statement about the guilt or innocence of a suspect? Sure, but then again, so is an arrest and indictment. The origin of the cuffs is the least of an arrestee's legal worries. Should we be spending government resources transporting a specific set of handcuffs or a police vehicle for its symbolic relevance? One might argue that if bringing those handcuffs costs even one dollar more than just using local handcuffs, a merely symbolic gesture may not be warranted. The reality is that our government spends money on symbolism all the time. Does our government ""need"" to pay the head coach at the Naval Academy $1.5 million? Is the United States required to send athletes to the Olympics? Do we really even need the White House Rose Garden? None of these are technically necessary to the operation of our government, but there is value to demonstrating the majesty of democracy, both at home and abroad. When viewed against some of the other things our government spends money on, requisitioning a pair of special handcuffs for a special arrest hardly seems excessive. Government symbolism has real value; and value sometimes costs real dollars. Should the police be engaged in any symbolic taunting of suspects? In the vast majority of cases, no. Not just because suspects are presumed innocent, but also because taunting suspects would undermine community confidence in police, and possibly undermine the arrest itself. As it is, an arrest is a public event, and already humiliating enough on its own. But cop killings are different. Law enforcement is highly protective of its own; a slaying of a fellow officer breaks down all barriers between different departments and agencies. In this case, it is no longer business, it's very personal. After all, it could have been any of them ambushed that day. Police deal with constant scrutinyâ€”by the community, defense lawyers and even their own prosecutors. Oh, and they can get killed doing their job. It's no surprise they develop an us-against-the-world mentality, which makes the bond among them even stronger. While departments must closely referee to guard against excessive celebration with suspects, we can probably look the other way when it comes to some strategic use of otherwise standard equipment to honor a comrade.","Danny Cevallos: Some have questioned whether cops arresting Eric Frein out of line .

"(CNN) -- The first commercial spacecraft to return from a low-Earth orbit splashed into the Pacific Ocean on Wednesday about 500 miles off the coast of Southern California. The Dragon, a craft developed by the company SpaceX, was concluding a brief but possibly historic flight for the infant commercial space travel industry. The vehicle hit the water shortly after 2 p.m. ET, a little more than three hours after liftoff from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida atop a Falcon 9 rocket. Before splashing down, the Dragon orbited earth at more than 17,000 mph. Only six nations or government agencies have recovered a spacecraft from a low orbit: the United States, Russia, China, Japan, India and the European Space Agency. Wednesday's landing was also the first flight under NASA's Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program. The program aims to develop commercial supply services to the international space station. NASA Administrator Charles Bolden praised the mission. ""These new explorers are to spaceflight what Lindbergh was to commercial aviation,"" he said Wednesday. ""While rocket launches from the Cape are considered a common occurrence, the historic significance of today's achievement by SpaceX should not be lost."" Bolden said the mission reflected a new generation of commercial launch systems that would support the international space station and that could eventually carry astronauts into orbit. It also coincides with the scaling back of some publicly funded space programs. NASA is set to retire its shuttle fleet in 2011. President Barack Obama's administration would like to see whether private companies can do the fleet's job cheaper and more efficiently. ""This successful demonstration flight is an important milestone in meeting the objectives outlined by President Obama and Congress, and shows how government and industry can leverage expertise and resources to foster a new and vibrant space economy,"" Bolden said of Wednesday's flight. In July, a test launch of the Falcon 9 rocket was ""essentially a bulls-eye,"" SpaceX officials said after the rocket successfully pushed past Earth's atmosphere and deposited a mock-up of its Dragon space capsule in orbit. NASA has been flying shuttles in low Earth orbit for nearly 30 years and going to and from the space station for more than a decade. NASA has selected SpaceX and another company, Orbital Sciences, to each develop an orbital vehicle that could be used when the United States no longer has its own way to get to the space station. In the meantime, the United States will be renting space from the Russians aboard their Soyuz spacecraft. The competition is rabid. SpaceX is the first company to reach the launch pad. By this summer, it had spent almost $400 million to get there. SpaceX currently holds a $1.6 billion contract from NASA to transport cargo, but not people, into space. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, co-founder of PayPal, said in July that if all goes well after a series of test flights, SpaceX will be ready to begin flying cargo to the space station next year. Musk says it could begin ferrying astronauts to the space station within three years. ""We want to see a future where we are exploring the stars, where we're going to other planets, where we're doing the great things that we read about in science fiction and in the movies,"" he said in July. Other entrepreneurs in the emerging commercial space travel business say flights will no longer be confined to astronauts. Spaceport America, a commercial launch facility in Truth or Consequences, New Mexico, is expected to be fully operational by the end of 2011. The company's main tenant, Virgin Galactic, hopes to launch short tourist excursions into space in the near future. CNN's Michael Martinez and Rich Phillips contributed to this report.","SpaceX's Falcon 9 had a brief but possibly historic flight .

"(CNN) -- England prides itself on being the home of football, but is the nation dysfunctional in dealing with racist abuse? Last week British anti-racism group Kick It Out (KIO) published the results of a survey asking over 4,000 English footballers about their experiences of racist abuse. Just 200 chose to respond. Of those to reply in the anonymous consultation, 24% said they have been subjected to racist abuse in football stadiums, while 57% claim they have witnessed racist abuse. ""It's enough of a sample -- it's never been done before,"" KIO trustee Garth Crooks told CNN. ""We simply don't have the resources to conduct a wide enough survey and to get the numbers that might make the likes of CNN jump up and down,"" said Crooks, who was the first black chairman of the Professional Footballers' Association -- the players' union. He's also a former player. While KIO struggles with resources, Crooks also laid bare the tensions that exist within the professional game, criticizing the English Football Association, the League Managers' Association and the clubs themselves for not doing enough to address the problem of racism. In October England manager Roy Hodgson had to defend himself against a racism slur after using the ""feed the monkey"" punchline from an old NASA joke when telling defender Chris Smalling to pass the ball to winger Andros Townsend during a World Cup qualifier. Smalling and Townsend are both black. ""I would like to apologize if any offense has been caused by what I said at halftime,"" the 66-year-old Hodgson told British media at the time. ""There was absolutely no intention on my part to say anything inappropriate. However Crooks says that's just not good enough and called on the League Managers' Association, the body which represents English coaches, to show more leadership. ""So Roy Hodgson isn't making stupid, inappropriate comments at halftime in the dressing room during a World Cup qualifying match."" CNN contacted the LMA for comment and is awaiting a response. ""These football clubs are employers,"" added Crooks. ""They have a duty to their staff, and their staff to their employers. ""Why is this happening? Why should football get some kind of special concession because they're footballers and football clubs?"" he wondered. Almost all of the footballers surveyed by KIO -- 91% -- agreed that ""social media has led to an increase in them receiving discriminatory abuse,"" the organization said in a statement. Former England and Liverpool striker Stan Collymore has -- more than once -- said he has been racially abused on Twitter, and two years ago a 21-year-old student was sent to jail for racist comments he made on Twitter after Bolton midfielder Fabrice Muamba collapsed on the pitch against Tottenham in a game and almost died. The 21-year-old had pleaded guilty to the Racially Aggravated s4A Public order Act 1986. The KIA survey of players also found that 92% of players thought fan-on-player discrimination was common or extremely common, and 69% of players felt that, due to their profession, they are more exposed to abuse. All of this was enhanced by the rise of social media. ""What the social media platforms need to do is acknowledge the level of the problem and introduce some specific procedures,"" said KIO spokesman Richard Bates. ""There has to be a more proactive stance."" Twitter was not immediately available for comment and Facebook declined to provide an official response. But Crooks is more concerned that the clubs aren't taking enough of a proactive approach. ""I'd like to see them conducting mentoring sessions with football players right across the board in order that players understand the impact making silly statements on Twitter can have on themselves and their clubs,"" he said. ""It is an employer's duty to ensure that its staff behave in an appropriate manner. A lot of players on social networking sites are making some remarkable pronouncements and it's bringing the game into disrepute, and also bringing the club and its brand into question."" The FA admitted more could be done to educate players. ""Relaying key messages around equality and inclusion into the often 'closed off' domain of the dressing room is something the game as a whole needs to keep working on,"" said the FA in a statement. ""We hope our new Reporting Discrimination films, which show players exactly what to do when they hear or see discrimination, is one such tool."" The English Premier League said in a statement: ""All Premier League clubs have social media policies for their players and the League itself produced social media guidelines, at the request of our member clubs, in 2012. ""Additionally, the Premier League education department runs social media training sessions for Academy players, and has done so for the last three seasons."" KIO was established in 1993 to try to confront racist attitudes within the game. The group says it works with the leagues, clubs, fans and players in combating racism. The KIO survey was carried out between August 2013 and December 2013 and followed footballer Jason Roberts' refusal in 2012 to wear a T-shirt in support of the anti-racism campaign group due to what he saw was the football authorities' failure to come down hard on those who are found guilty of racism. ""This is not an attack on Kick It Out,"" Roberts told the Guardian in October 2012. ""I am passionate about what the Professional Footballers' Association represents and Kick It Out but they (the league) have to do better, we have to do better."" Crooks has mixed views on Roberts' stance. ""He was right, football wasn't doing enough. I've less sympathy with the way he went about it. We want the same things. That is, we want football to not appear apologetic to racist behavior,"" the former Tottenham striker said. ""We have bans now, we have automatic bans -- a minimum five matches for the football league, 10 matches for UEFA, and that's fine. But the process can take forever."" Crooks is referring to the time it took the FA to handle high-profile cases involving a handful of players including Nicolas Anelka. However, England's governing body insisted it was important not to rush these cases in order to reach a fair verdict. ""Many of the cases the FA presides over require detailed expert consideration of a range of issues, where assistance from outside the organization is often enlisted...,"" it said in a statement. ""To that end, and to get a fair and satisfactory outcome, the process isn't always a swift one."" Nearly two months had passed before Anelka was punished for the controversial ""quenelle"" gesture he made in late December, arguably creating a vacuum for plenty of heated debate. Last month Anelka was banned for five matches and fined Â£80,000 ($130,000) by the FA for performing the gesture after scoring for West Brom in a Premier League match against West Ham. The ""quenelle,"" which the former France international said was dedicated to his comedian friend Dieudonne M'Bala M'Bala -- who uses it as part of his act -- is believed by some to be a Nazi salute in reverse and has been linked with anti-Semitism in Anelka's homeland. Crooks, the former union chairman, despairs at the way Anelka's case was handled. ""It's taken the best part of two months to make a decision that should've been done in two weeks,"" Crooks said. ""If Anelka had apologized, which he should have done, and West Brom had imposed a two-week fine immediately, it would've been done and dusted. ""Here the first thing that the employer does is to protect the player because he's a famous footballer. ""There is a lot that is fundamentally wrong with the way football deals with racism and West Brom is a very clear example of that."" West Brom declined to respond directly to Crooks' criticism, but pointed to the statement it released on March 14 after Anelka quit the club. ""The club considers the conduct of Nicolas Anelka on December 28, coupled with his purported termination on Social Media this evening, to be gross misconduct. As a result the club has tonight written to Nicolas Anelka giving him 14 days' notice of termination as required under his contract,"" it said at the time. When the row broke out, Anelka defended his actions on social media, arguing his gesture was ""anti-system"" rather than anti-Semitic. ""This is a dedication to Dieudonne. With regard to the ministers who give their own interpretations of my quenelle, they are the ones that create confusion and controversy without knowing what it really means, this gesture,"" the Frenchman wrote on Twitter. ""And of course, I am neither racist nor anti-Semitic and I fully assume (stand by) my gesture."" So while the talk and the rants on social media sites grows ever more vitriolic, and controversial, it sounds as if England's football authorities have plenty of work to do - not least in coming up with a co-ordinated strategy in dealing with the issue of race and discrimination.","Just 200 out of over 4,000 footballers responded to Kick It Out racist abuse survey .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Convicted ""shoe bomber"" Richard Reid was given permission to correspond from prison with members of his family this summer, after the Justice Department allowed restrictions on him to expire. Richard Reid was arrested in December 2001, accused of trying to blow up a plane with explosives in his shoes. But several homeland security experts say that even with wardens screening every letter, they'd prefer to see imprisoned terrorists held completely incommunicado. ""If a terrorist can communicate with his family, with other associates -- even with monitoring -- he could use codes; he could be directing other terrorist acts,"" said former New York City Police Commissioner Howard Safir, who is now a security consultant. ""This is somebody who tried to blow up hundreds of innocent people on an airliner, and in my view, he should be totally restricted."" Safir first voiced his concern in an interview with the Boston Herald over the weekend. Watch reaction to new rights for Reid » . The British-born Reid pleaded guilty seven years ago to trying to blow up a jetliner flying from Paris, France, to Miami, Florida, in December 2001 using explosives hidden in his shoes. He was sentenced to life in prison and is jailed at the high-security ""Supermax"" federal penitentiary in Florence, Colorado. A Justice Department spokesman said that after a thorough review, the special administrative measures that Reid had been under were not renewed in June, on the recommendation of three agencies: the FBI, the prosecuting U.S. Attorney's office and the Justice Department's Counterterrorism Section. Reid had sued the Justice Department over the issue. Even with the restriction lifted, Bureau of Prisons spokeswoman Traci Billingsley says, the only people a Supermax inmate can correspond with are his direct family members, his attorneys and the media. In addition, ""any regular inmates, especially terrorism convicts, have all their communications screened, both incoming and outgoing,"" she said. But limiting letters to family members does not prevent wider dissemination, says Clark Kent Ervin, former inspector general for the Department of Homeland Security. ""Those letters could be forwarded by family members to others,"" he said. Another risk, according to Ervin: ""The propaganda potential is huge for these kinds of things. Terrorists can be hugely inspiring figures"" to young militants hearing jailhouse manifestos, he says. Several years ago, three convicted terrorists from the 1993 World Trade Center bombing managed to send at least 90 letters to militants overseas, including those linked to the Madrid, Spain, train bombings. And according to a Justice Department's inspector general report of September 2006, one of them also ""praised Osama bin Laden as a hero in a letter sent to Arabic newspapers."" But in the wake of that report, Justice Department spokesman Dean Boyd says, all phone calls and mail from international terrorist inmates are now screened. ""Mail is not delivered to or sent from such inmates until it is read (translated if necessary) and analyzed for intelligence purposes,"" with the help of FBI personnel and on-site Arab-language specialists, Boyd says. ""If suspicious content is found, the correspondence is referred to the FBI for analysis before being processed any further."" In addition to Reid, Supermax houses some of the most notorious convicted terrorists, including 1993 World Trade Center bombing mastermind Ramzi Yousef, September 11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui, ""dirty bomb"" plotter Jose Padilla and ""millennium bomb"" plotter Ahmed Ressam.

"Kunduz, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Police in the northern Afghanistan province of Kunduz are looking for a man they say strangled his wife after she bore him a third child that was not a son. Sher Mohammed, 29, married his 22-year-old wife, Storay, four years ago, police said. The couple had three daughters, the last of whom was born three months ago, said Khanabad district police chief Sufi Habib. After the youngest daughter was born, Mohammed blamed his wife for not being able to deliver a boy, Habib said. ""Finally on Saturday, the man, with the help of his mother, first beat the woman and then strangled her to death,"" the police chief said. Khanabad is about 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Kunduz city. Police arrested the mother, Wali Hazrata, and detained her at the Kunduz city jail. But her son fled. In a jailhouse interview, Hazrata said her son's wife committed suicide out of guilt. ""My son did not commit the crime,"" Hazrata said. ""... But after three daughters, Storay herself felt guilty and committed suicide."" The report comes weeks after Afghan police said they rescued a 15-year-old girl who was locked up in the basement of her in-laws' house, starved, and had her nails pulled out. The girl, Sahar Gul, was married off to a 30-year-old man last year. Authorities in northern Baghlan province said the girl reportedly was tortured after she refused to submit to prostitution. Activists say women continue to suffer in parts of Afghanistan despite overall progress since the fall of the Taliban. In the second quarter of last year, the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC) registered 1,026 cases of violence against women. In 2010, it recorded 2,700 cases. In December, gunmen attacked and sprayed an Afghan family with acid in their home after the father rejected a man's bid to marry his teenage daughter. In another case, a 21-year-old, identified only as Gulnaz for her own protection, was sentenced to 12 years in prison after she reported that her cousin's husband had raped her. Her plight attracted international attention when it came out that she had agreed to marry her attacker to gain her freedom and legitimize a daughter conceived in the attack. She was eventually freed, following President Hamid Karzai's intervention. Horia Mosadiq, a London-based Afghan researcher for the rights group Amnesty International, said the abuse inflicted on Storay Mohammed is not an isolated instance. ""Generally the human rights situation, and particularly women's rights, is deteriorating,"" she told CNN. ""I am in constant contact with women's rights groups across the country, and they say they are seeing an increase in violence."" This is in part because the Afghan government does little to implement or enforce the laws that protect women's rights, she said. She also sees it as a consequence of women across the country gaining greater awareness of their rights, which is leading both to a backlash from men and to more cases of violence being reported. On top of that, the Afghan government's move toward peace and reconciliation talks with the Taliban has led many people to think the current oppression of women will simply continue as it is, Mosadiq said. ""We need to make sure that we protect the women -- it's so important that women's rights in Afghanistan are non-negotiable,"" she said. The alleged involvement of Storay Mohammed's mother-in-law in her abuse is not unusual, Mosadiq added, as women often play a role in violence against other women within the family, as do husbands, fathers and brothers. And there is a heavy cultural pressure to bear sons, who are viewed as the breadwinners, she said, with the birth of a daughter seen as a burden rather than something to celebrate. If the situation of Afghan women is to improve, Mosadiq said, a strong political will is needed at the government level, backed up by strong pressure from the international community. ""Where (the international community) puts so much pressure and focus on a military solution, they should also think about the protection of the Afghan people and Afghan women,"" she said.

"Editor's note: Fareed Zakaria is a foreign affairs analyst who hosts ""Fareed Zakaria: GPS"" on CNN at 1 p.m. ET Sundays. Fareed Zakaria says the shoe-throwing incident shows Iraq is becoming a more open society. NEW YORK (CNN) -- The Iraqi journalist who hurled his shoes at President George W. Bush has won some hearts in neighboring Iran, where one cleric dubbed the act ""the shoe intifada (rebellion). Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati -- leading Friday prayers in Tehran -- hailed journalist Muntadhar al-Zaidi's now-famous fling last Sunday, when Bush and Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki were holding a news conference in Baghdad. His remarks -- reported by Iran's state-run Islamic Republic News Agency -- reflect the support many Middle East people have shown for al-Zaidi, an Iraqi correspondent for Egypt-based Al-Baghdadia TV. ""The shoe intifada in Iraq should not be overlooked easily,"" Jannati said. ""Well done to the Iraqi journalist for throwing the shoes at the U.S. president."" Speaking to worshipers at Tehran University, Jannati labeled the shoes ""more valuable than crowns, medals and signs"" and believes they should be placed in an Iraqi museum. CNN spoke to world affairs expert and author Fareed Zakaria about the shoe-throwing incident . CNN: Do you think the shoe-throwing incident shows that Iraq is becoming an open society? Fareed Zakaria: Yes, and President Bush was right that it represents a huge advance in freedom in the Middle East. There is quite simply no other Arab country in which that scene could have taken place. And Iraq has, in other ways, become a reasonably open and democratic society -- though still a long way from a liberal democracy as we would define it. CNN: So not a big deal -- just fodder for late-night comics? Zakaria:  Not quite -- what the shoe-throwing incident also reminded us of -- and this is something that Americans often forget -- is that whatever the gains in Iraq recently -- and they are undeniable and real -- the costs for Iraqis have been huge. We focus on the costs to America -- hundreds of billions of dollars spent, more than four thousand American lives lost there. But the costs to the Iraqis have been staggering . 2.5 million Iraqis -- 10 percent of the population -- have left the country, and only a few are trickling back. Another 2 million have been displaced from their homes. Tens of thousands of Iraqis have been killed and wounded -- and that may be underreported. Maybe in the long run, if Iraq becomes a more decent society, these costs will fade into memory and the benefits will endure. But for now, as Muntadhar al-Zaidi's actions showed -- it is the costs that remain front and center in the Iraq consciousness. CNN: How are Iraqis responding to the incident? Zakaria: For many it is embarrassment --as former U.S. Ambassador to Iraq and the current U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Zalmay Khalilzad says on our show -- ""I know it was painful to Prime Minister Maliki and many Iraqis who have been in touch with me since."" And the Iraqis are going to prosecute al-Zaidi within their court system -- though they aren't completely sure how yet. CNN: But it seems like he's become a hero for many in the Middle East. Zakaria: Yes -- and that goes back to the enormous costs that the Iraqis have faced. However, his celebrity is not limited to the Middle East. In an act of reverse cultural imperialism, his act of frustration is now taking hold in the United States. Earlier this week at a meeting of New York City's Metropolitan Transit Authority, an angry protester was dragged out as he attempted to throw his shoe at the authority's CEO. His last words before security got him: ""this shoe is for you!""","Fareed Zakaria: Shoe-throwing incident shows Iraq is becoming more open society .

"(Mental Floss) -- Students, we know you may not be all that ecstatic about seeing your teachers -- and the homework they assign -- as the school year starts up.

Robert Frost: Like King, Frost worked as a teacher to supplement the income from his fledgling literary career. Frost worked as both a farmer and teacher at the Pinkerton Academy in Derry, New Hampshire. His students called him ""the Hen Man"" because the poet was afraid of chickens, and Frost allegedly had trouble remembering to milk the school's cows on time. Lyndon Johnson: The future president got his start as a principal at the Mexican-American Welhausen School in Cotulla, Texas. He later finished his teaching degree and landed gigs teaching public speaking at Pearsall High School in Pearsall Texas and Sam Houston High in Houston. The debate team he coached at Sam Houston lost the Texas state championship by a single point; Johnson supposedly had to vomit backstage before he could bring himself to congratulate the winners. Art Garfunkel: We can't speak for Paul Simon, but at least half of Simon and Garfunkel was really, really good at math. Garfunkel nearly earned a doctorate in the subject and was teaching math at the Litchfield Preparatory School in Connecticut when ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" soared to the top of the charts. John Adams: The second president of the United States spent a few years working as a schoolteacher in Worcester, Massachusetts. Teaching didn't suit Adams, who thought his students were nothing more than a ""large number of little runtlings, just capable of lisping A, B, C, and troubling the master."" He eventually gave up the job to go to law school. Mr. T: It was hard for Chicago students to be fools when it came to gym class in the mid-1970s.

Billy Crystal: The comedian worked as a junior high substitute teacher on Long Island while he waited for his career to take off. Among the classes he subbed for: girls' gym, which must have been a great source of material. Kris Kristofferson: The country star was a Rhodes Scholar who studied literature at Oxford before joining the Army and rising to the rank of captain.

"(CNN) -- When it comes to what she deems the American ""obesity crisis,"" Sarah Varney says, it's easy enough to focus on the raw numbers: Sixty-nine percent of Americans are overweight, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and 35.1% of those people are obese. In 2008, medical care costs related to obesity were as high as $147 billion, and an obese person's annual medical bill was $1,429 higher than that of a normal-weight person. Varney's new book ""XL Love: How the Obesity Crisis Is Complicating America's Love Life,"" out in August, looks at how our increasing girth is weighing on the humans beyond the statistics, particularly the way people relate physically and intimately. Random online match helps man lose nearly 400 pounds . ""I certainly don't see the obesity epidemic reversing itself any time soon,"" Varney said. ""We're just beginning to understand how human relationships are being affected."" During her 2Â½ years of research, Varney found that obesity can have a chilling effect on sexual relationships, from physical barriers to intimacy to attitudinal shifts with weight gain and even loss. Varney became immersed in the topic as a senior correspondent for Kaiser Health News and a contributor to the NPR series ""Living Large,"" which focuses on how obesity is changing American life. The book looks at how obesity is altering sexual development, dating, marriage and sexual function; how weight loss can make or break a relationship; and even the lure of plus-size porn. Varney says it took a lot of work to gain the trust of her subjects, many of whom she met through weight loss counselors. They shared highly personal, and often difficult, stories of love lives dramatically affected by weight. They're people like Dana Englehardt of the San Francisco Bay Area. Readers first encounter Englehardt at her heaviest, 265 pounds, strapped to a CPAP machine for sleep apnea and completely indifferent to her husband, Larry's, advances to the point where he had stopped trying. ""I just felt so bad about myself. Even though my husband said, 'I love you the way you are,' I couldn't even begin to imagine that that could be true,"" Englehardt told CNN. She said she had a satisfying sex life at 200 pounds, but when she gained 65 more after marriage, later hours at work and unhealthier cooking, ""it just pushed me over the edge."" Englehardt pops up later in the book after undergoing bariatric surgery for weight loss and encounters an interesting twist: Weight loss didn't solve her sexual roadblocks; therapy that addressed body image as a whole and marriage counseling did. ""I just thought losing the weight would solve all that. I wouldn't have all these hang-ups,"" Englehardt said. While the pounds fell off and the clothes got smaller, she says, ""I didn't feel like a small person."" As she began to reclaim her energy, confidence and sexual desire via the surgery and counseling, she discovered that the learning curve wasn't just hers to navigate. ""I didn't know that you were interested anymore,"" Englehardt's husband, Larry, says in the book. ""And so I had to basically learn, and I'm still learning, when she's interested and when she's not."" Couple shed 280 pounds and get noticed for the right reasons . ""I do think there is this stereotype that (the obese) just shut down, this idea that you go numb and are at war with yourself,"" Varney said. ""But when you go knocking on that door, what you hear are things like, 'I'm incredibly saddened by this. I desperately want to be in a relationship with my husband or my wife. I want to it to feel good when he/she touches me.' "" In a chapter titled ""Sex: The Birds and the Bees with Aching Knees,"" Varney moves from the brain to the body, exploring ""bad mechanics"" between partners as well as how belly fat can decrease testosterone production in men, potentially leading to sexual issues. You don't have to be overweight to experience bad sex or a lack of libido, says one advocate for sex at any size. ""The problem with the assumption that fatness 'challenges' relationships in some unique way is that it relies on a mistaken assumption that the exact same kinds of body-image issues do not affect anybody who is not fat,"" body image activist Hanne Blank said. Blank has written extensively on sexuality and weight, including books like ""Big Big Love: A Sex and Relationships Guide for People of Size (and Those Who Love Them)"" and ""The Unapologetic Fat Girl's Guide to Exercise and Other Incendiary Acts."" ""Orgasm is not a pants size. Fun is not a body fat percentage,"" Blank said. ""There is not a magical BMI number that produces love. End of story.""

"Washington (CNN) -- The Democratic candidate for governor of Massachusetts just got some more bad news. Attorney General Martha Coakley became the first Democratic governor candidate in 20 years to not receive the endorsement of the Boston Globe in the general election, with the publication instead endorsing Republican Charlie Baker on Sunday. The endorsement comes on the heels of the race's latest poll, which showed Coakley down by 9 points. The Boston-based newspaper, the most prominent in the state, backed Baker, claiming the Republican would deliver more effective state governance. The newspaper's editorial board suggested that the prospects of Baker and a veto-proof Democratic majority in the state legislature could result in ""creative tension,"" forcing both parties to come together and solve the state's problems. ""One needn't agree with every last one of Baker's views to conclude that, at this time, the Republican nominee would provide the best counterpoint to the instincts of an overwhelmingly Democratic Legislature,"" the endorsement reads. The newspaper also endorsed Baker over Coakley because it claimed the Republican would in fact be the better candidate to ""consolidate"" outgoing Democratic Gov. Deval Patrick's legacy on reforms tied to education, health care and public transportation. ""At a difficult inflection point in state government, Massachusetts needs a governor who's focused on steady management and demonstrable results,"" the Globe's editorial board wrote. Democrats are boosting efforts to save Coakley's declining stock. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton joined Patrick and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren at a campaign rally for Coakley on Friday. Clinton's visit came after her husband former President Bill Clinton and First Lady Michelle Obama have also rallied voters in Massachusetts to support Coakley. And Vice President Joe Biden will head to the state for a fundraiser on Wednesday.

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Cuba says it foiled a terrorist plot by Cuban exiles to attack military facilities on the island and has arrested four U.S. residents. According to an Interior Ministry statement, the men -- identified as Jose Ortega Amador, Obdulio Rodriguez Gonzalez, Raibel Pacheco Santos and Feliz Monzon Alvarez -- were arrested last month after traveling to Cuba to ""promote violent actions."" It was not clear whether the men had been officially charged or appointed attorneys. The statement said Cuban officials would ask the U.S. government to investigate the activities of the men, who the statement said were all U.S. residents. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Wednesday that she did not have additional information about the accusations. ""The Cuban government has also not been in touch with us yet on these cases,"" she told reporters. The Cuban government alleged that the arrested men have ties with Luis Posada Carriles, a Cuban exile and former CIA operative accused of blowing up a Cuban commercial airliner in 1976. Posada has denied he participated in that attack, but he remains a wanted man in Cuba and Venezuela for his alleged role in the airline bombing, which killed 73 people. In its statement Wednesday, Cuba's interior ministry also accused several other Miami-based exiles of orchestrating plans for an attack. One of them, Santiago Alvarez, denied any association with the men Cuba says it arrested. ""I don't recognize the names,"" he said. ""It's all a smoke screen to start a crackdown on dissidents.""

"(CNN) -- For a ""Wallflower,"" Stephen Chbosky's Charlie has quite a reputation. The character, a sensitive 15-year-old high school freshman who initially keeps to himself, was first introduced to a generation of readers in 1999 as the protagonist of Chbosky's novel, ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower."" Since then, he's become just as famous for being too risquÃ© for some classrooms as he is for endearing himself to a legion of fans. In a series of letters addressed to an anonymous reader, Charlie describes the disorientation of losing a friend to suicide, the ways high school can feel like an experiment in isolation, and, at the heart of the story, his bond with older students Sam and her stepbrother, Patrick. Now, 13 years after readers first met him, Charlie is in theaters this weekend in an adaptation written and directed by Chbosky. The movie features actors who've appeared in versions of other young-adult books, such as Emma Watson (the ""Harry Potter"" series), Logan Lerman (""Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief"") and Nina Dobrev (the CW's ""The Vampire Diaries""). But there aren't any spells or mythological beings in Chbosky's tale -- there's just Charlie, the shy, introspective loner who finds acceptance within Sam and Patrick's circle of friends. The great thing about Chbosky's story, actress Dobrev said at a recent screening, is that while it focuses on the turmoil of one high school freshman, it's nonetheless relatable. ""It makes you realize that everyone's kind of the same,"" she said, noting that all have a coming-of-age story that's seen love and pain, laughter and heartache. ""Even though you feel like you're the only one going through it at the time, everyone has at one point or another,"" she said. In the end, Dobrev concluded, ""Perks"" shows that we're all misfits in our own way. Charlie's early '90s-era high school experience touches on drugs, alcohol, sex and abuse, and at the time of its publication, the book was one of many examinations of the darker side of the teen experience, said Vicky Smith, children's and teen editor for Kirkus Reviews. What set it apart from the rest was its voice. In the late '90s, ""there was this wave, of what it felt like to a lot of people who worked with kids and books, of really depressing books,"" Smith recalled. ""There was a continuum called the 'teen problem novel,' the novel about teenage pregnancy, and the novel about cutting, and the novel about anorexia. ""Right around the end of the '90s, a lot of those books, they were by and large really well-written, but they were really bleak. And 'Perks of Being a Wallflower,' while it's not really a laugh riot, was still funny enough and different enough from those incredibly bleak ones to catch a lot of people's attention."" It also didn't hurt that it was published by MTV -- back then home to ""Total Request Live,"" Britney Spears and ""Daria"" -- through Gallery Books' Pocket imprint, which gave it an air of youthful understanding. ""('Perks') resonated because at the time, it was dealing with issues that weren't really in the mainstream,"" said Louise Burke, executive vice president and publisher of Gallery Books. By today's standards, ""Perks"" might seem low-tech, but the novel hasn't lost its relevance, appearing at No. 16 on NPR's 100 best-ever teen fiction poll this summer and hitting No. 1 more recently on a New York Times' best-seller list. ""The teens that I speak to really love that these issues are being dealt with but it's not overdramatized,"" Burke said. ""It's interesting that a book published so long ago is even more relevant now."" Add in the strong reaction from schools and libraries -- ""Perks"" is no stranger to the American Library Association's list of frequently challenged books -- and the book was ""viral"" before anyone even knew what that was, Smith said. ""It had that hand-to-hand, pass-along effect that books (that) kids would get from their teachers or librarians don't have,"" Smith said. ""My daughter is in high school, and she wanted to read it before the movie came out, and I do think it spent a little bit of time getting passed around the cabins at her summer camp."" That peer endorsement from a friend was also how Marah Eakin, now 31, first picked it up in 1999 and became a fan. ""I had just started college,"" recalled Eakin, music editor for culture site The A.V. Club. ""And I remember feeling like, 'These people understand me.' "" She was one of those kids ""who listened to college radio,"" she joked, and while she might have wished to identify with love interest Sam or witty Patrick, it was the sensitive but openhearted Charlie with whom she connected. ""I think that's a universal feeling. You could be the class president, but you still feel like people don't entirely get you,"" Eakin said. ""I don't think that ever really changes, but it does go away a little bit."" Rereading it as an adult, she said she can see why it's a book meant for a younger audience -- its earnestness and angst being out of step with grown-up sensibilities. But ""the fact that it's stood the test of time for 13 years is important, because the YA marketplace turns so fast; it turns on a dime with trends,"" Eakin said. ""I think that this (book) still existing is a credit to Stephen Chbosky."" And that persistent fondness for ""Perks"" is ""one of the things that makes a classic,"" Smith said. ""As the first generation of 'Perks' readers starts having kids and seeing them grow up on their own, it'll be interesting to see how freely they share it. ... I think 'Perks' has a good chance of experiencing that kind of generational longevity.""","""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" stood out when it was published in 1999 .

"San Diego (CNN) -- Politicians in both parties might have seriously miscalculated. The election returns aren't in yet, so we can't know for sure. Still, if trends continue, this could turn out to be a bad year for fear. When this election season started several months ago, Republicans and Democrats thought they'd scare up a few votes by accusing their opponents of being, let's see, soft on the border, determined to take away women's reproductive rights, simpatico with tea party extremists, incapable of protecting America from terrorists or deadly viruses, eager to impeach the President, or even intent on dragging us back to one of our country's darkest chapters by bringing back lynching. You think I'm exaggerating? Perhaps a little, but not much. Have you taken a look at the campaign fliers in your mailbox? Be warned. They're pretty scary. This October, every day felt like Halloween. Whether it was coming from Republicans or Democrats, the message was pretty much the same: ""Boo!"" Or in the long form, it went like this: ""You're in danger!"" And Candidate XYZ is going to make you even less safe and more vulnerable. You need to protect yourself and your family, and vote against Candidate XYZ. And hey, look, I'm on the ballot, too. So why not vote for me as a safer alternative?"" This isn't your usual surge of negative campaigning, where candidates sling mud and attack one another's character, honesty or integrity. Americans are used to that. In fact, hopefully, they're largely immune to it by now. This is much worse. What was on display in many of this year's Senate races was the politics of fear, where politicians are so desperate to get elected or re-elected that they use inflammatory commercials and wild accusations to terrify the same group of voters who they should be trying to inspire with a hopeful and confident message. When will they learn that positive messages are always stronger than negative ones? This lesson was not lost on two of the most successful politicians in the last half of the 20th century: Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton. Both men were happy warriors whose hopeful messages triumphed over the doom and gloom peddled by their opponents. The good news is that, this year, it doesn't seem as if this strategy have worked out very well for the fear mongers. Look at the polls in races where specific candidates have tried to scare voters away from their opponents: . -- Fear is on the run in North Carolina, where a third party group's campaign mailer in support of Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan, which was clearly aimed at African-Americans, warned that electing Republican challenger Thom Tillis would set the stage for the immediate impeachment of President Barack Obama. The faded image in the background: a lynching. So if Hagan isn't re-elected, the nation's first African-American president is headed for a political lynching? That's shameful but not exactly subtle. In the same contest, the Senate Majority PAC released a radio ad slamming Tillis for his support for Stand Your Ground Laws ""that caused the shooting death of Trayvon Martin."" So Tillis somehow contributed to the 2012 death of Martin? Outrageous. -- Fear is on the run in Texas, Arizona, California and New Mexico where Republicans want to scare voters into thinking that ISIS and Ebola -- or perhaps even ISIS militants infected with Ebola -- are salsa dancing across a porous U.S.-Mexican border. There's no evidence that either ISIS or Ebola is coming across the border, and the Department of Homeland Security has called the idea ""categorically false."" Consequently, that line of attack isn't gaining any traction in key races in border states. Even in those races where Republicans are favored, the scare tactics don't seem to winning over independent voters who wouldn't normally support the GOP. Why doesn't the Republican Party just be honest and go back to what GOP elected officials in the Southwest have always portrayed as the real threat: Invading hordes of Mexicans who steal the worst and dirtiest jobs? Maybe Republicans are the ones who are afraid. Maybe they're concerned that, if they said this, they would sound racist. Imagine that. -- And, most of all, fear is on the run in Colorado, where Republican Cory Gardner maintains a narrow lead over Democratic Sen. Mark Udall in most polls. Technically, the race is a toss-up, but given that Udall had the money and name recognition that comes with being the incumbent, it's no wonder that Democrats are bracing for a defeat. Udall bet all his marbles on the female vote, but then he proceeded to insult that constituency by overplaying his hand. Forgetting that women care about issues such as the economy and terrorism as much as men do, Udall pushed the issue of abortion rights to the point where the senator has been mockingly dubbed: ""Mark Uterus."" This was not a good re-election strategy for Udall, but it has turned out to be good for the Gardner campaign. Even with all this election year negativity, there is a positive side. One group of voters after another -- from African-Americans to pro-border security conservatives to women -- have, whether they realize it or not, been given a valuable gift. On Tuesday, they have the opportunity to shrug off the soundbites, declare their independence from the politics of fear and send a message of their own. From this point on, they need to insist upon something that elected officials don't always give voters: respect.","Ruben Navarrette: Seeing political ads may be the scariest part of Halloween this year .

"(CNN) -- Nearly 12 years after Congress debated and subsequently voted for American military action in Iraq, another debate over that Middle Eastern country is roiling Washington. This debate is not taking place on the floors of the House or Senate; it is taking place in the media. Members of Congress and even the former vice president who helped plan the U.S. invasion of Iraq more than a decade ago took to the Sunday political talk shows to voice their positions. As militants, which President Barack Obama said Sunday on CBS News' ""Face the Nation"" poses a ""medium and long-term threat."" continue to gain ground in Iraq, we'll get you up to speed on what top officials in Washington said in the Sunday political shows. Lacking intelligence . Now that Obama has announced his plans for Iraq, which includes sending up to 300 military ""advisers"" to the country, the blame game on how Iraq dissolved into chaos continues. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California and chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said the intelligence community was not fully aware of the scope of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. She said intelligence did ""know about"" ISIS in Syria, but it did not adequately account for the possibility that the group could overtake a third of Iraq so quickly. ""This is a difficult culture,"" Feinstein said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""It is very difficult to pierce."" She added that U.S. intelligence has holes in places other than Iraq, including North Africa and Yemen. ""The world is a big place,"" she said, ""and this is extraordinarily difficult to do."" Her counterpart in the House, Chairman Mike Rogers, disagreed, insisting intelligence gathering did not fail. In Iraq, militants press on toward Baghdad . View from Baghdad: Answering your questions about Iraq crisis . The blame game . Everyone points fingers. And they're all pointed in a different direction. It ""was a policy failure,"" Rogers said on CBS News' ""Face the Nation."" Rogers said Obama's inaction is what led to the quick rise of ISIS in Iraq, insisting that not ""dealing with"" ISIS earlier ""has got us a bigger problem."" ""We didn't do anything in Syria; we didn't do anything when they took Falluja; we didn't do anything when they took Mosul; they got into Tikrit and said, 'Hey this is a problem,' "" he said. 4 western Iraqi towns fall to advancing ISIS militants . That's a sentiment expressed by former Vice President Dick Cheney. After writing a scathing op-ed slamming Obama for ""being ""so wrong about so much,"" Cheney came out swinging again, this time on ABC's ""This Week."" ""I think he's dead wrong in terms of the course he's taken this nation, and I think we're in for big trouble in the years ahead because of his refusal to recognize reality and because of his continual emphasis upon getting the U.S. basically to withdraw from that part of the world,"" Cheney said. During the G.W. Bush administration, Cheney played a key role in urging the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 to search for weapons of mass destruction, a hunt that ultimately proved fruitless. Cheney has remained a supporter of the war in Iraq. He said Obama ""left a big vacuum"" by not agreeing to a deal with the Iraqi government to leave American troops behind after the war ended. Like Cheney, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul also said the U.S. has ""created a vacuum."" But that's where their agreement ends. Paul said, ""I do blame the Iraq War on the chaos that is in the Middle East. I also blame those who are for the Iraq War for emboldening Iran."" He said Iran has benefited from Sunni and Shiite conflict in the region. ""What's going on now, I don't blame on President Obama,"" he added on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-California, who was one of 23 senators who voted against going to war with Iraq in 2002, said on CBS News' ""Face the Nation"" that Cheney's vocal input is ""a nightmare come back to haunt me."" ""The fact is what you're seeing now is an outgrowth of that bad policy the neocons got us in -- that crowd on false pretense that said, 'Go in there.' "" As ISIS advances toward Baghdad, a call for fighting volunteers is answered . The role of Syria . As ISIS gained strength and clout by fighting in Syria's civil war against President Bashar al-Assad, Boxer dismissed argument made by many in the Republican Party that a hands-off approach in Syria is what emboldened ISIS. ""The hawks are saying the President knew that ISIS was in Syria and didn't want them to get control of the weapons,"" Boxer said. But Paul said the limited U.S. role in Syria was too much and that's what emboldened ISIS. He said the minimal weapons, vehicles and communications equipment the U.S. sent to ISIS gave them greater capability. ""Here's the anomaly. We're with ISIS in Syria. We're on the same side of the war. So, those who want to get involved to stop ISIS in Iraq are allied with ISIS in Syria. That is the real contradiction to this whole policy,"" Paul said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" Iraq history facts . Middle East borders will never be the same . American action . Obama has received a mixed response from those in Congress as well as outside observers for his measured response to the crisis, including sending military advisers who ""will be prepared to take targeted and precise military action if and when we determine that the situation on the ground requires it."" He also sent Secretary of State John Kerry to Europe and the Middle East to engage allies and interested parties in the crisis. Emphasizing Kerry's diplomatic trip, Obama said in a portion of an interview aired Sunday that the U.S. is not going to deal with Iraq unilaterally. He also said the U.S. has to have a ""more focused, more targeted strategy"" as extremist groups are active throughout the Middle East and North Africa. ""[What] we can't do is think that we're just going to play Whac-a-Mole and send U.S. troops occupying various countries wherever these organizations pop up,"" Obama said on CBS News' ""Face the Nation,"" echoing remarks he made in a news conference Thursday. Cheney, however, wants troops -- and more of them. ""When we're arguing over 300 advisers when the request had been for 20,000 in order to do the job right, I'm not sure we've really addressed the problem,"" he said on ""This Week."" And Cheney said if it were up to him, he would assist the Iraqi army with training and provide Shiites with weapons ""to be able to do a more effective job."" Rogers criticized the President's overall philosophy on the region. ""And it's not Whac-a-Mole, this is in our national security interest. Bumper sticker phrases aren't gonna win this thing,"" Rogers said. ""We've gotta be dug in for the long haul because they're dug in for the long haul."" Opinion: Obama's sensible Iraq plan is likely doomed . Opinion: Can Obama avoid mission creep? Obama, however, has his supporters. ""I think the President is doing the right thing,"" Feinstein said. ""He's being a bit circumspect. He's being thoughtful."" Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said the President's actions are ""a little late,"" but he added, ""I do think they're on the right track now in terms of this dual strategy."" Boxer said she agrees with the President. ""We're not going to go back into that war again, ever,"" she said on CBS News' ""Face the Nation."" Paul, who doesn't believe ISIS is an immediate threat to the United States, said he'd be cautious about any further action, wanting to see whether the Shiites are going to stand up and fight. ""[Am] I willing to send my son to retake back a city, Mosul, that they weren't willing to defend themselves? I'm not willing to send my son into that mess,"" Paul said on ""State of the Union."" Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a member of the Intelligence and Foreign Relations committees but also a potential contender for the 2016 presidential race, differentiated himself from Paul, a possible presidential challenger. He said on ""Face the Nation"" that he hopes Obama's plan is ""not simply a symbolic measure"" but ""the first step in a multistep process."" Rubio advocated for a plan similar to Cheney's that included airstrikes to cut off ISIS's supply lines from Syria and to ""potentially"" hit ISIS's command structure. ""The reason that al Qaeda was able to carry out the 9/11 attacks is because they had a safe operating space in Afghanistan that the Taliban had given them. And now history is trying to repeat itself here,"" Rubio said. Obama said ISIS fighting ""could spill over into some of our, you know, allies like Jordan."" Rogers was more direct: ""It's not that they may have designs on Jordan, they do have designs on Jordan."" Kerry: U.S. would communicate with Iran, not work with it, against ISIS .","Sen. Dianne Feinstein said intelligence wasn't fully aware of the swift capabilities of ISIS.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama's final campaign isn't turning into much of a victory lap. His role in next week's midterm elections, which amount to the last important contest of his political career, has been to quietly rake in campaign cash for the Democratic party, rather than headline the stadium rallies he became famous for in 2008 and 2012. The final week before the midterm elections is slated to be Obama's busiest, though the eleventh-hour politicking will only take the president to states that went his direction in 2008 and 2012. He'll campaign mostly for governors, whose role outside Washington puts them further from the unpopular White House policies that give Democratic Senate candidates heartburn. The objective: turning out Democrats who don't have a great record voting in midterm contests. His lone stop for a Senate candidate comes in Michigan on Saturday for Democrat Gary Peters, currently running ten points ahead of GOP rival Terri Land. National Republicans stopped spending ad money there weeks ago. Obama's truncated campaign schedule only reflects how big a drag the unpopular commander-in-chief is on his party's most vulnerable Senate candidates. The electoral calendar has left Democrats uniquely positioned to lose control of the upper chamber, a fact party insiders are already citing ahead of potential losses. Related: Key Senate races in 2014 . Related: CNN / ORC Poll - Voters are angry . In Republican-leaning states like Louisiana and Alaska, Democrats are scrambling to keep seats amid near-record lows in Obama's approval ratings. Democratic senators are working to convince swing electorates that Obama's policies aren't necessarily their own in North Carolina, Colorado and New Hampshire. And in Republican strongholds like Georgia and Kentucky, Democratic candidates are quick to promise total independence from an unpopular White House. That leaves Obama with few options to return to the campaign trail — his last opportunity as president. On Tuesday he flew to Wisconsin, where the Republican Gov. Scott Walker is virtually tied with his Democratic challenger Mary Burke in a race that's focused largely on the state's economy. It's one of the nation's marquee governor's race -- one Democrats desperately want to win -- and the highest-profile contest to feature a visit from Obama. That Burke, a former Trek bicycle executive, doesn't have to answer for an Obama-aligned voting record makes a visit from the president tenable. And with a statewide approval figure of 51%, according to a recent Marquette survey, Obama's in far better shape in Wisconsin than he is nationwide. Related: Senate math seems impossible to some Democrats . ""The goal of the visit is to persuade the once-every-four-year voters to vote this time,"" said Mortecai Lee, a professor of governmental affairs at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. ""In Wisconsin politics, the higher the turnout, the more it skews Democratic. The lower the turnout, the more it tilts GOP. So this is [Burke's] effort to increase the size of the pie rather than fighting over the small remaining undecided slice of the current pie."" Obama's other stops this week -- Thursday in Maine for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mike Michaud, Friday in Rhode Island for remarks targeting women voters, and Sunday in Connecticut for Democratic Gov. Dan Malloy -- are also meant to turn out Democrats in states where he still remains somewhat popular. In Maine, Obama's objective will be to get Democratic voters to ""act like Democrats,"" said Brian Duff, a political science professor at the University of New England in Maine, citing past elections there that have seen independent candidates shave away support from Democrats. ""In essence, this is a case where the question is less about matters of public policy, and more about energy and enthusiasm behind Michaud rather than the independent -- the Democrats have built some but need to keep it up another week. The president's visit should help with that,"" Duff said. The same dynamic exists in Connecticut, where Obama hopes to help Malloy pull ahead in a tied race with Tom Foley, a former U.S. ambassador to Ireland. The president's only other campaign stops this cycle, on a single Sunday this month in Maryland and Illinois, were both convened with the aim of turning out African-American voters in states already dyed blue. The White House, which says its main focus is on combatting ISIS and stopping the spread of Ebola, has said Obama is ""psyched"" for his return to the campaign trail, no matter how diminished his role. And they note that next week's results will be pinned to the president, no matter the outcome. ""I feel confident predicting in advance is that the President will at least get some credit if Democrats hold onto the majority in the Senate and he'll get more than his fair share of the blame if they don't,"" Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Monday.","President Obama has not been visible on the campaign trail for his final Midterm election as president .
His low approval ratings could be a drag for some Democrats in key Senate races .

"(CNN) -- No tricks here, just the treat: In honor of Halloween, J.K. Rowling is delving into the back story of one of ""Harry Potter's"" more twisted Hogwarts professors. On Rowling's Pottermore website, the best-selling author has crafted a story about the life of Dolores Umbridge, whom fans will remember for her toad-like appearance, her hair bows and the gruesome way she chose to punish students. It turns out that Umbridge was inspired by a real person. There was a teacher of Rowling's whom she ""disliked intensely on sight,"" and it seems the feeling was mutual. To be clear, this teacher wasn't ""the real Dolores Umbridge,"" but her love of childlike accessories definitely inspired the character. ""What sticks in my mind is her pronounced taste for twee accessories,"" Rowling says in an essay about the character. So although this teacher didn't ""look like a toad, was never sadistic or vicious to me or anyone else, and I never heard her express a single view in common with Umbridge ... it is true to say that I borrowed from her, then grossly exaggerated, a taste for the sickly sweet and girlish in dress."" As for Umbridge's love of kittens, that was inspired by a former officemate of Rowling's, whose adoration for small furry creatures was in contrast with ""a lack of real warmth or charity."" New 'Potter' character finds spotlight . ""So Dolores, who is one of the characters for whom I feel purest dislike, became an amalgam of traits taken from these, and a variety of sources,"" Rowling explains. ""Her desire to control, to punish and to inflict pain, all in the name of law and order, are, I think, every bit as reprehensible as Lord Voldemort's unvarnished espousal of evil.""

"(CNN) -- For years the message was simple: Use condoms to prevent HIV. But if you are at high risk of contracting the virus, health experts want you to consider an additional strategy -- taking a pill every day to reduce your chance of being infected. New guidelines published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, should be taken daily by people who are at high risk for contracting HIV. The recommendation is based on several large national and international studies, which were done in varying at-risk populations, such as gay and bisexual men, heterosexual couples where one person is HIV-positive (the other is not) and injection drug users. The studies all showed that this drug can help reduce infection rates by more than 90% when taken daily. ""While a vaccine or cure may one day end the HIV epidemic, PrEP is a powerful tool that has the potential to alter the course of the U.S. HIV epidemic today,"" Dr.Jonathan Mermin, director of the CDC's National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD and TB Prevention, said in a statement. ""These guidelines represent an important step toward fully realizing the promise of PrEP. We should add to this momentum, working to ensure that PrEP is used by the right people, in the right way, in the right circumstances."" According to the guidelines, those circumstances would be anyone who: . • has had sex without a condom; . • is not infected with HIV but is in a sexual relationship with an HIV-infected partner; . • is a gay or bisexual man who has had a sexually transmitted disease within the last six months and is not in a mutually exclusive relationship with a recently tested HIV-negative partner; . • is a heterosexual man or woman who does not always use condoms when having sex with partners already at risk, and who isn't in a mutually exclusive relationship with a recently tested HIV-negative partner; . or . • has injected drugs or shared drug paraphernalia in the past six months . In 2012, the Food and Drug Administration approved Truvada, a pill that combines two antiretroviral drugs for the prevention of HIV. It was first approved in 2004 as an HIV treatment and is still the only FDA-approved medication for PrEP. Truvada isn't cheap. A month's supply can cost you anywhere from $1,300 to $1,700, according to Drugs.com. But insurance may cover the bill. To be effective, this pill must be taken every day. Dr. Anthony Fauci, an immunologist who has been at the forefront of HIV/AIDS research for decades, called it a highly effective approach to preventing the spread of the virus that causes AIDS. ""(It's) one that benefits not only the individual patient at risk for HIV infection but also will help to reduce the number of new HIV infections across the United States,"" said Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health. ""It should be used together with -- and complementary to -- condoms and not as a substitute for condoms."" The new guidelines replace interim ones published two years ago; they provide a comprehensive place where doctors and patients can find information on PrEP and come with a supplement that provides checklists for physicians, giving them step-by-step support for dealing with patients who might be considered for prophylactic treatment. ""PrEP is a new approach to HIV prevention that requires continuing collaboration between patients and providers, as effectiveness requires adherence to daily medication and regular medical visits for monitoring, counseling and testing,"" said Dr. Dawn K. Smith, an epidemiologist in CDC's Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention who led the development of the guidelines. ""Individuals will have to decide with their doctor if PrEP is right for them, but for some, this may offer a much-needed strategy to help protect themselves from HIV infection."" There are 1.1 million people in the United States living with HIV, according to the CDC. An estimated nearly one in six do not know they're infected. Men who have sex with men are the hardest hit -- while they make up 2% of the U.S. population, they account for 63% of all new infections each year, according to the CDC. Heterosexuals make up 25% of all new annual infections; 9% are injection drug users. ""HIV infection is preventable, yet every year we see some 50,000 new HIV infections in the United States,"" said Dr. Tom Frieden, the CDC's director, in a statement. ""PrEP, used along with other prevention strategies, has the potential to help at-risk individuals protect themselves and reduce new HIV infections in the United States.""","CDC recommends at-risk groups take Truvada daily to prevent HIV infection .

"(CNN) -- How often do you see sports stars looking to the heavens in search of a little inspiration? They might be on to something. That's why the team hoping to build one of the fastest yachts on the planet is not looking to the water -- but to the sky. Or to be more precise, the giant passenger plane flying overhead. Oracle Team USA, the reigning America's Cup champions, have revealed their unlikely ""secret weapon"" in the hugely prestigious sailing race is Airbus. The aviation giant has partnered with billionaire businessman Larry Ellison's sailing team to create what it hopes will be an unbeatable high-tech yacht in the next edition of the race in 2017. But what does an airplane company know about boat design? ""If you look at it closer, sailing and flying share a common DNA,"" said Airbus President and CEO, Fabrice BrÃ©gie. ""Look at the importance of wind forces on airplane wings, and wind forces on the sails of a boat. They even look alike. And the speeds in aviation and boating share the same unit -- the knot."" Planes on water . Indeed, gone are the days of heavy wooden yachts with single hulls and white billowing sails. Today's sleek carbon fiber multihulls are like airplanes on water, sitting high above the waves, with crew members wearing wetsuits, carrying oxygen tanks, and communicating via radio. And much like aircraft, these feats of design have rigid sails, rather than conventional material ones. With competing teams spending tens of millions of dollars on their America's Cup bids, Ellison -- a software entrepreneur with an estimated fortune of $48 billion -- will also be digging into his deep pockets to create a state-of-the-art yacht. ""The America's Cup is a boat race, but the design technology and engineering are very often the winning factor,"" said team skipper Jimmy Spithill, who knows what he's talking about -- he also has a pilot's license. ""They're as much like airplanes as they are like traditional boats, so I know we'll have a lot to learn from the engineers at Airbus."" Rule Britannia? Watching developments closely will be the British challengers -- led by four-time Olympic gold medalist Ben Ainslie -- who earlier this year launched their $134 million bid alongside their own secret weapon -- the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Middleton. A keen sailor herself, the Duchess went head-to-head against her husband Prince William in a yacht race during their recent tour of Australia and New Zealand -- emerging victorious 2-0. It's hoped she'll not only pass on some of that winning spirit to Ainslie's team, but also add the type of international luster so attractive to the world's richest investors. In the 163 year history of the race, Britain has never won the prestigious silver trophy. Adding insult to injury, the first competition took place on its shores in 1851. Where sky and sea meet . Back across the Atlantic, work has already begun collecting data on the Team USA boat, with over 300 on-board sensors providing real time information to a main server. Much like its planes, Airbus will be analyzing the data closely. ""When they get a brand new plane for the first time, they fly it and log hundreds and hundreds of variables,"" explained Oracle Team USA project manager, Ian Burns. ""They are testing it and trying to improve the airplane."" he said. ""And this is exactly the same when we launch our boat and go sailing for the first time."" Perhaps Airbus will also take away a thing or two from its new water-based collaboration. Already, the company has introduced a ridged texture much like shark's skin on its plane's wings, to improve air flow. The worlds of flight and sail are not so dissimilar as they might seem. And somewhere between sky and sea, the next America's Cup will take place. Insight: Guts and glory -- 162 years of America's Cup design .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- At least three dozen people were killed and scores were injured in fighting that flared up Friday in and around the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi, the government said. A count from six hospitals totaled at least 36 dead and 139 wounded, a Health Ministry official said at a news conference Saturday. The situation in the city appeared calm so far on Saturday, according to residents, and no fighting had been reported. A retired military general led Libyan troops and other forces loyal to him in a deadly attack Friday against Islamist militants in and around Benghazi, Libyan media reported. The government disavowed the action. Retired Gen. Khalifa Haftar, who participated in the 2011 rebellion that ousted dictator Moammar Gadhafi, launched the attack that supporters said was an attempt to clear the city of extremist groups, CNN affiliate Libya Awalan TV reported. Meanwhile, the spokesman for Haftar's military force made a televised statement calling on residents in three neighborhoods to evacuate, raising concerns about renewed fighting. ""An urgent call to our people residing in al-Quwarsha, Sidi Faraj and al-Hawari, to evacuate their homes and neighborhoods to preserve their lives and for their safety"" said Col. Mohammed Hijjazi, the spokesman for Haftar's self-declared Libyan National Army. It was not immediately clear whether residents were evacuating. Flight ban announced . According to the Libyan state news agency LANA, The office of the Army chief of staff announced in a statement on Saturday a flight ban over Benghazi until further notice. The statement warned that any military aircraft flying over Benghazi will be targeted by army units, security forces and revolutionary forces under its command. The revolutionary forces phrase is a term the government uses to describe state-sanctioned militias. The statement came after residents on Friday reported that aircraft, including helicopters, took part in Haftar's assault, striking some militia bases. The prime minister said that at least one air force jet was used in the attack without government orders. Late on Friday, LANA quoted sources in Benghazi as saying at least one member of the jihadist group Ansar al-Sharia was killed on Friday when an aircraft struck the group's base in the city. International carriers including Tunisair, Royal Jordanian and EgyptAir canceled their flights to Benghazi on Saturday after authorities announced closing the airport on Friday night. The director of Benghazi's Benina International Airport, Ibrahim al-Farkash, told Libyan Television that authorities decided to close the airport as of 8 p.m. Friday as a ""precautionary measure."" He said the closure was for the safety of passengers and the airport, adding that the airport road was not safe, either. Awash in armed groups . Residents and officials have blamed the violence that has gripped Benghazi on militant groups, including Ansar al Sharia. The United States designated that group a terrorist organization this year, and has accused it of being involved in the 2012 attack that killed four Americans -- including U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens -- at the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi. Official Libyan security forces have struggled to deal with hostile militias, so the government has relied on other militias, many on the state's payroll, in an attempt to enhance security. But various other political forces also have relied on militias, leaving the country awash in armed groups -- many who refused to disband after the revolution -- with competing agendas and loyalties.","NEW: A flight ban over Benghazi is announced .

"(CNN) -- As outrage grows over a Sudanese woman sentenced to death for refusing to renounce her Christianity, the government defended the verdict, but said it's only preliminary. A Khartoum court last week convicted Meriam Yehya Ibrahim, 27, of apostasy, or the renunciation of faith. Ibrahim, who is eight months pregnant, is a Christian, her husband said. But the court considers her a Muslim. ""I'm so frustrated. I don't know what to do,"" said her husband, Daniel Wani. ""I'm just praying."" 100 lashes . The court also convicted her of adultery and sentenced her to 100 lashes because her marriage to a Christian man is considered void under Sharia law. Wani is American, Ibrahim's lawyer Mohamed Jar Elnabi told CNN. The attorney said he'll file an appeal within a few days. Sudanese parliament speaker Fatih Izz Al-Deen said the verdict is not final and is in the hands of the judiciary. The verdict will go through all the judicial stages to reach the constitutional court, the speaker told Um Derman radio station. His comments were cited Friday by the official Sudanese News Agency. Ibrahim says she was born to a Sudanese Muslim father and an Ethiopian Orthodox mother. Her father left when she was age 6, and she was raised by her mother as a Christian. However, the lawyer representing Ibrahim's family said Sunday that the mother is a devout Muslim. The court had warned Ibrahim to renounce her Christianity by Thursday, but she held firm to her beliefs. But the parliament speaker said that claims she was raised as non-Muslim are untrue. She is a Muslim raised in an Islamic environment and her brother, a Muslim, filed the complaint against her, according to Izz Al-Deen. The complaint alleges she went missing for several years and her family was shocked to find out she married a Christian, according to her lawyer. However, because her father was Muslim, the courts considered her one too, which would mean her marriage to a non-Muslim man is void. Attempts to contact Sudan's justice minister and foreign affairs minister were unsuccessful. Pregnant with toddler in prison . Ibrahim's husband is struggling to survive. He uses a wheelchair and ""totally depends on her for all details of his life,"" said Jar Elnabi, her lawyer. In addition to her pregnancy, the couple's 20-month-old toddler is with her in prison, and he is getting regular ailments due to lack of hygiene and the presence of bugs, the lawyer said. She's having a difficult pregnancy, and a request to send her to a private hospital was denied, the lawyer said. There also is the question of the timing of a potential execution. In past cases involving pregnant or nursing women, the Sudanese government waited until the mother weaned her child before executing any sentence, said Christian Solidarity Worldwide spokeswoman Kiri Kankhwende. Worldwide condemnation . Rights groups and foreign embassies worldwide condemned the verdict. ""The fact that a woman could be sentenced to death for her religious choice, and to flogging for being married to a man of an allegedly different religion, is abhorrent and should never be even considered,"" said Manar Idriss, Amnesty International's Sudan researcher. Katherine Perks with the African Centre for Justice and Peace Studies said the verdict goes against Sudan's ""own constitution and commitments made under regional and international law."" Foreign embassies in Khartoum, including those of the United States, United Kingdom and Canada, urged the government to reverse course. CNN's Catherine Shoichet, Christabelle Fombu, Mohammed Tawfeeq and Mohammed Osman contributed to this report.","Meriam Yehya Ibrahim considers herself Christian, but a court says she's Muslim .

"(CNN) -- What started as a night drinking in the pub, turned into a morning riding a wild zebra. If it sounds like the kind of story generated by one-too-many beers and a vivid imagination, then there's no doubting legendary horse trainer Gary Witheford's photos. Yep, that's a girl riding a zebra, all right. While other trainers usually take six to eight weeks to break in a horse, British equine expert Witheford says he can do the job in just 20 minutes, as revealed in his new book ""If Horses Could Talk."" Not just horses -- but donkeys, llamas, and a black-and-white striped animal better associated with the African savannah than the English countryside. ""I've done four zebras,"" says the 54-year-old, who has also broken race horses belonging to Britain's Queen Elizabeth II, Dubai ruler Sheik Mohammed, and England's national football team captain Wayne Rooney. ""They said zebras can't be broken, they can't be ridden. But the first one was broken in 40 minutes. And the next one, which was completely wild, was broken and ridden away in 20 minutes."" Wild ride . In his 30 years in the business, Witheford, who prefers to be called a ""horseman,"" says he has never encountered an animal that was not tameable. And that includes zebras -- the horse's exotic equine cousin, which for centuries has roamed the African plains unsaddled. Witheford made a boozy boast to that effect while drinking with friends at a local bar one night in 1996. Little did he realize he was overheard by a woman who worked at nearby Longleat Safari Park in the south of England. ""I can get you a zebra,"" she said. True to her word, the following morning Witheford was confronted with two zebras -- one of them so flighty it dashed straight out onto the motorway, where it narrowly escaped oncoming traffic. These creatures were wild, even by the ""horseman's"" standards. One kicked him so hard with its hind legs that it split his hand open. ""Zebras are at the bottom of the pecking order,"" explains Witheford. ""The lions and the hyenas are always on their backs. ""So they're sharp -- they have to react to sounds, smell, and sight very quickly or they'll get eaten. They're always on guard."" Meet Mombasa . Nonetheless Witheford set to work on the first zebra, called Mombasa, much like he would any other horse -- though rather than bending down to attach the saddle, he kept his distance by using a type of pulley system. He allowed Mombasa to race and rear around the pen until the three-year-old colt tired himself out to the point of compliance. When it comes to the details of Witheford's taming technique however, the fast-talking trainer makes it sound so simple. ""I just go into the pen, put a saddle on it, let it have a little buck and a rear, and then within two minutes it wants to come back to you,"" says the grandfather-of-three, speaking by phone from his stables in Wiltshire, in the south of England. ""It's about reading the animal -- understanding it by the way it licks and chews, its ears and eye contact, how the body language is working. ""Once it starts to trust you, it does what you ask it to do."" Peculiar pet . Once Mombasa was settled, a small jockey was needed for the zebra, which stood just 12 hands high. Schoolgirl and keen rider Nicky Davies was enlisted for the task, and within 30 minutes was happily trotting the animal around the pen, much to everyone's amazement. Three more zebras followed Mombasa, eventually living on Witheford's farm as among the most unusual pets the English countryside had ever seen. ""You'd call Mombasa and he'd come galloping over, braying like he does,"" Witheford says. ""He was like my dog, he was so friendly."" Healing horses . Could Witheford's magic touch come from a deeper, spiritual connection, given the issues of childhood trauma that he reveals in his book? ""I threw myself into horses, and I learned to stay away from people -- people hurt you, horses don't,"" says Witheford. ""I think they understood that I might have come from a broken family -- they see the innocence in me, and I see the innocence in them."" Today, the celebrity trainer ""breaks in"" anywhere between 600 and 800 horses a year -- not that he sees it that way. ""Break is a bad word,"" says Witheford. ""You don't want to break the horse. If you went to school for the first day in your life, and you got knocked about and frightened, you wouldn't want to go back the second day. ""It's more about starting something new. 'Start' is a nicer word I think."" A new start, not just for the horses -- but for the legendary ""horseman"" himself. Learn: Thoroughbred therapy on Cape Town coast .

"(CNN) -- The fate of a 900-pound statue of Joe Paterno remains unclear as the Penn State community debates the former head football coach's legacy in light of a recent report that said several Penn State officials helped empower Jerry Sandusky in sexually abusing minors. A decision will be made in seven to 10 days on whether the bronze tribute will remain on campus, said Penn State spokesman David La Torre. However, one man, the sculptor, hopes Penn State officials do not rush to make a judgment. ""As an artist, of course, part of me is in that statue, but I'm willing to go along with the just or fair decision,"" said Angelo Di Maria, who designed the sculpture of the former coach in 2001. Di Maria hopes officials will wait for emotions to ""cool down a bit"" before making a final decision. ""I say wait and see,"" he added. ""Nothing will diminish what happened. [But] do we throw away all the positive things that [Paterno] did? Do we cross out his name from the history of State College?"" Commissioned to design a sculpture honoring Paterno more than a decade ago, Di Maria attended his first football game in Beaver Stadium and, unbeknownst to the coach, took pictures of Paterno on the field. ""It was an incredible experience,"" Di Maria said. ""The energy I felt there was incredible."" Di Maria designed the iconic sculpture from his experience at that first game. ""It was so common for him to run out on the field,"" Di Maria said. ""Finger up in the air â€” like No. 1 -- State College No. 1, team No. 1."" Paterno's statue and legacy, however, have come under fire in the week after the release of the Freeh Report, the scathing investigation led by former FBI Director Louis Freeh. NCAA could bring down heavy sanctions . The report found several Penn State officials concealed evidence that former assistant coach Jerry Sandusky had sexually abused minors. Freeh concluded that Paterno could have prevented further sexual abuse had he taken action. Sandusky was convicted of 45 counts of child sexual abuse involving 10 victims. New accusations date back to 1970s . The Freeh report has shaken support for Paterno in the State College community. Paterno was fired after Sandusky was charged. He died earlier this year. A small plane flew around the Penn State campus on Tuesday carrying a banner that read, ""Take the Statue Down or We Will."" Di Maria, however, believes Paterno's impact on the community should not be forgotten. ""Nothing justifies what happened to those kids,"" Di Maria said. ""But are we underestimating his goodness that he shared with so many people while he was living?"" ""Are [the students] in their own way -- of course, nowhere near what the victims suffered â€” are they victims in their own sense? I think so,"" he added. ""Do we have to consider those other people? Not just Joe Paterno, but what he stood for?""","Fate of Joe Paterno statue will be determined in 7 to 10 days .

"(CNN) -- It may not have had the table topping tension of recent Der Klassiker clashes but the old quality certainly remained as Bayern Munich overcame Borussia Dortmund in a pulsating match at the Allianz Arena Saturday. Marco Reus gave Dortmund the lead going into the break before a sweeping strike from Robert Lewandowski and a late Arjen Robben penalty swung the match in Bayern's favour. The win marks the first time Pep Guardiola's men have triumphed against Dortmund at home since 2010 and preserves their unbeaten start to the Bundesliga season. Dortmund, meanwhile, remain third bottom of the table, a remarkable fact given their domestic success and European form of recent years. That there was a 14-place gap between these two teams was far from clear through much of this match, however. Both sides created chances in a high-quality first half that could have ended 3-3 let alone 1-0. Roman Weidenfeller was given early work to do as he beat away a vicious Arjen Robben shot with five minutes on the clock. Henrikh Mkhitaryan then cracked a post for Dortmund shortly after before a spectacular scissors kick from Thomas Muller was dealt with by Weidenfeller. The speedy Pierre Emerick Aubameyang was denied by Bayern keeper Manuel Neuer just after the half hour mark when put through by Shinji Kagawa -- but Dortmund didn't have to wait long to make the breakthrough. On the very next attack, the dangerous Aubameyang broke down the right and delivered an inch perfect cross that was nodded home by Marco Reus. The German international has been heavily linked with a move to Bayern next summer but showed little regard for his potential future employers here, setting the tempo for Dortmund's rapier counter attacks. But Bayern under Guardiola aren't used to losing, let alone losing in their own stadium. The second half began with the Bavarians swarming all over their Dortmund, pressing in packs -- as is the hallmark of Guardiola teams -- and pushing their opponents ever deeper into their own territory. Wiedenfeller was forced into action to deny Lewandowski with a fine save while Robben and Xabi Alonso both let fly with dangerous long distance strikes. Defender Mehdi Benatia then missed a golden opportunity when he headed wide from six yards out. But Polish international, Lewandowski, would not be denied after 70 minutes. The ex-Dortmund man was the first to react to a loose ball that broke against Dortmund defender Neven Subotic and he fired low beyond the diving Weidenfeller who had yet to fully set himself. Bayern were now clearly in the ascendancy with Dortmund looking tired and offering little going forward. As full time approached substitute Frank Ribery burst into the Dortmund penalty area where he was pulled back by the chasing Subotic. The Serbian vociferously claimed his innocence but referee Manuel Grafe had no doubts and pointed to the spot. Robben stepped up and calmly placed the ball low into the bottom left hand corner, sending Weidenfeller the wrong way in the process and ensuring his side would claim the spoils. English Premier League . Liverpool's stuttering start to the season continued away to a resurgent Newcastle United Saturday. Ayoze Perez scored the only goal in closely fought 1-0 victory to give Alan Pardew's men their third win in the space of six days. Table topping Chelsea, meanwhile, rallied to defeat Queen's Park Rangers 2-1 at Stamford Bridge thanks to a late Eden Hazard penalty. Surprise package Southampton continued their fine start to the season with a 1-0 win away to Hull City while Arsenal ran out comfortable 3-0 winners at home to Burnley. Elsewhere, Everton and Fulham played out a 0-0 draw at Goodison Park, West Brom overcame Leicester City 1-0 and Stoke and West Ham drew 2-2. Title challengers Manchester City play cross town rivals Manchester United Sunday. La Liga . James Rodriguez scored twice as Real Madrid ran out comfortable 4-0 winners away to Granada to move top of La Liga. Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema added to the Colombian's brace although the European champions could be replaced atop the table by Sevilla who play Sunday. Atletico Madrid racked up an impressive 4-2 victory over Cordoba at the Vicente Calderon with Antoine Griezman (twice), Mario Mandzukic and Raul Garcia all scoring. Lionel Messi, meanwhile, was looking for one goal to equal the all-time La Liga goalscoring record held by Telmo Zarra but the Argentine's Barcelona side were upset by Celta Vigo who left the Nou Camp with a surprise 1-0 victory. Joaquin Larrivey scored the games only goal early in the second half. Serie A . Juventus moved clear at the top of Serie A after triumphing 2-0 away to Empoli thanks to second half goals from Andrea Pirlo and Alvaro Morata. A 2-0 defeat for Roma away to Napoli earlier in the day means the Bianconeri now sit three points clear at the top of the table. Ex-Real Madrid pair Gonzalo Higuain and Jose Luis Callejon were the scorers for the Neapolitans at the Stadio San Paolo.","Bayern Munich beat Borussia Dortmund 2-1 in Der Klassiker clash .

"(CNN) -- It takes a special person to join Mensa. For one, the elite society only takes individuals with IQ scores in the 98th percentile, meaning just 1 in 50 Americans is eligible. This exclusivity -- some might say snobbery -- is part of Mensa's lore. Early Mensans in Britain walked around with yellow buttons, organizational publications once referred to non-Mensa members as ""Densans,"" and last year, a top Mensa member and tester called anyone with an IQ of 60 a ""carrot."" In short, you don't always join Mensa because you think you're smart. You join to be set apart from most people, who are, as one member put it: ""mundane."" But a new partnership between American Mensa and online dating giant Match.com offers a new, enticing reason to join the society of geniuses: true love. Beginning this week, members of the brainiac group can connect through a separate, exclusive dating service called Mensa Match. In addition, Match.com members can add a special Mensa badge to their profiles, signaling a specific interest in connecting with a single person with a confirmed genius-level IQ score. Smart dating struggles . Anne Sereg is one of those geniuses. The 55-year-old Florida woman is an IT project manager who graduated high school in three years, college in two-and-a-half and has a law degree from Georgia State University. ""It's been a long time,"" she said about her dating life. ""I went hermit-y for a quite a few years. I just didn't find anyone who's been interesting enough."" Sereg found she does not connect with people who are athletes or sports nuts, for example. ""I'm looking for people who are intellectually curious. And when all you're talking about is sports teams and barbeques ... when you're talking about physical traits and not existential philosophy, I'm not going to get the vibe."" Sereg admits this attitude can limit her relationship options. But one expert thinks the results could be much worse. Ali Binazir is the author of The Tao of Dating, and penned a 2009 article, ""Why the Smartest People Have the Toughest Time Dating."" A Harvard graduate, Binazir said highly intellectual people can frequently feel ""entitled"" to love. And sometimes this means unwilling to make the compromises for a successful relationship. ""IQ tends to be pretty one-dimensional. There's no way to say if this person interacts well with others,"" he said. ""For a relationship, it matters more how that person implements that intelligence in the real world, for jobs and parenting and exchanging of ideas."" ""You need to remove the barriers to love. And when you exclude those people, as smart people tend to do, that's when you become lonely."" According to Match's data, 80% of singles say they ""must have"" or find it ""very important"" to be with someone of the same intelligence level. What your IQ score doesn't tell you . Sereg has decided a college education -- not a Mensa IQ -- is her basic requirement for a future mate. ""I just want someone who can keep up with me,"" she said. New possibilities . The new Mensa partnership will give Match.com users a new way to find common ground, said Helen Fisher, a professor at the University of Indiana and Match.com's chief scientific adviser. ""If you're proud of being in Mensa, if someone (else) is also proud of being in Mensa, then you're already in the same clan,"" she said. ""It's not unlike saying I read a lot of books and I'm looking for someone else who reads a lot of books. There's an automatic filter."" In their announcement of the partnership, Mensa and Match.com included a heat map of the U.S., listing where the ""smartest singles"" live, based on the cities with the highest percentage of Ivy League graduates on the dating site. The top 10 is dominated by college towns such as Durham, North Carolina; Ithaca, New York; Ann Arbor, Michigan; Boulder, Colorado; and Charlottesville, Virginia. Fisher cites numerous studies that suggest relationships with a brainy mate could come with great perks. ""People who are smarter tend to have a higher income, tend to be creative, coordinated, and good at solving problems,"" she said. ""So not only could you have a better conversation during dinner, but dinner could be in a nicer place, and (you could) leave in nicer car."" Binazir does not believe Mensa members are better at relationships than anyone else. But the partnership with Match.com provides another way for people to find common interests, which is always positive, he said. ""I think it's a step in the right direction."" Anne Sereg hopes he is right, but she won't get too excited just yet. ""One of the most recent marriages in our Mensa group came through finding each other on Match.com, and that was before the partnership,"" she said. ""I'm hoping that it (works). I don't know if it will. But you can't go anywhere if you don't have hope.""","Mensa and Match.com join to launch an exclusive dating service .

"(CNN) -- With all the scary stuff happening in the world -- ISIS, Ebola, take your pick -- it wouldn't be surprising if audiences steered clear of horror. But in fact, they're doing just the opposite. Two of the most popular TV premieres in October were in the horror genre -- ""The Walking Dead"" and ""American Horror Story,"" to be exact -- and one of those premieres rivaled the biggest comedy on TV. (That premiere was the season 5 start of ""The Walking Dead,"" to no one's surprise, and it was right behind the viewership for the fall premiere of CBS' ""The Big Bang Theory."") And the list of horror successes could go on. So what's behind our bloody fascination? There are a few theories. For one, the genre is an excellent antidote to boredom. It's obvious that the first thing viewers are looking for is ""enjoyment of thrill,"" said Mary Beth Oliver, a Penn State professor of media and psychology. Watching a show in which your favorite character's survival is far from guaranteed can bring about anxiety, she says, but that's also part of the fun. ""In a lot of horror films, the beloved protagonist ultimately gets away, if only for that particular episode or that particular movie in a series,"" Oliver said. ""The anxiety we feel when we're watching the show is palpable, (and) when that protagonist escapes, even by only a hair, then that (anxiety) feeds into our joy at this person's survival. So we don't feel a little bit happy, we feel really happy. It's like watching a close sporting event; it's a lot more thrilling if your team wins after a really close game than after a landslide."" And what if we're feeling anxious before we even sit down to watch a show? Something that's resonated with ""Walking Dead"" executive producer David Alpert is Chuck Klosterman's idea that zombies are a lot like email: ""You kill one, and it's going to draw two more in its place,"" Alpert said. ""I can work on my email all day, and at the end of the day, I might have more emails than I had when I started. ... You get this looming sense of dread that despite however hard you work, that it's only going to make more work for yourself. Ultimately, you're forced to rethink the way in which you live your life,"" he continued, not unlike one would have to if faced with a zombie apocalypse. ""I say that kind of sarcastically, but it also has real resonance with me,"" Alpert said. ""When my dad came home from work as a kid, he was done. Unless his office was on fire, no one was calling him. There was no email; no one expected you to respond. Technology has put us in a state where we're constantly reachable, which is great if you're looking to hook up or communicate, but the idea that you're constantly available leads people to expect you to constantly respond, and I think that leads to a heightened state of anxiety. Whether you want to call it globalization and economic fears coming off the economic collapse a few years back, I think we're looking at this situation where people have ... this real sense of unease."" If that's the case, one could imagine that would make that payoff Oliver talks about even greater. Another part of it, says horror disciple and ""Hannibal"" showrunner Bryan Fuller, is that the genre lends itself well to a communal experience. ""At the movies, part of the fun is going and sitting with the crowd and jumping in unison and hearing other people as frightened as you are and finding safety in collective fright,"" Fuller pointed out. Translate that experience to TV, especially in the era of social media, and watching a series that has a few jump scares, tension and ""OMG"" moments can make you feel like you're part of a massive viewing collective, even if you're the only one in front of the screen. It helps, too, that in horror, ""the stakes are as high as they get,"" Fuller added. ""It's life and death."" The stakes were also pretty high for networks to air horror shows before series like ""The Walking Dead"" and ""American Horror Story"" proved to be audience magnets. Yet this current captivation with horror isn't just about scares and thrills. (And, it should go without saying, it's far from the first time we've had some great horror concepts on TV.) What the latest wave of genre-inspired series has been able to do is tap into the classic material in a fresh way and reimagine the methods for telling horror on TV. ""When you talk about horror, often people think about the gore, the gross-outs, the jump-scares and the tension, and we have those,"" Alpert said. ""But I don't think people stay for that. It gives you those great moments where you reach over to the other person sitting next to you on the couch and you have that (shocked) reaction, but the reason why you go back is because you care about what happens to the character."" FX realized the appetite for horror shows when it took a chance on ""American Horror Story"" in 2011, the network's first foray into the genre. ""Having a great concept and having Ryan Murphy's execution on that concept made us feel confident about it,"" said Eric Schrier, the president of original programming for FX Networks and FX Productions. ""I don't think we ever thought it would be the hit that is; the show's huge now, and it's grown over the years. It took a little bit of getting used to for audiences, but once they caught on, they became enamored with it."" That adoration opened the door for Guillermo del Toro's gruesome vampire saga ""The Strain"" and, according to Fuller, for shows like his own ""Hannibal."" ""I don't think NBC would have rolled the dice on 'Hannibal' if it weren't for the successes of 'The Walking Dead' and 'American Horror Story,' where they thought, OK, let's try our own brand of horror, which is different from those two but still in the same trough,"" the showrunner said. ""As with any sort of pioneering show, it just takes one to ... expose the audience to the quality of horror storytelling."" NBC isn't the only network eyeing horror; MTV just added an adaptation of the 1996 slasher ""Scream"" to its 2015 roster. But thankfully, instead of getting 12 ""Walking Deads,"" we got the ""Psycho""-inspired ""Bates Motel"" on A&E; ""Sleepy Hollow"" on Fox; ""Penny Dreadful"" on Showtime; and ""Hannibal,"" an elegant but deadly psychological thriller that's amassed a rabid following. ""Horror films have been one of the earliest staples of cinematic storytelling ... so it's been around as long as cinema has been around. All of those things have been in our vocabulary,"" Fuller said. Now, ""all those classic tropes of genre that some would argue are too tired or too stale"" are being given ""fresh blood for a new audience, and really reinvigorating our taste.""","Horror on television is drawing monster ratings .
The current wave is being credited with elevating the genre .
Shows like ""The Walking Dead"" and ""American Horror Story"" paved the way ."
"(CNN) -- Matt Sandusky stood in solidarity with his adoptive father, Jerry Sandusky, while a grand jury investigated multiple allegations of child rape against the former Penn State assistant football coach. Matt Sandusky told the grand jury nothing inappropriate had ever happened to him. And he sat with the rest of the family early in Jerry Sandusky's recent trial. But last week brought a bombshell that shook the proceedings: Matt Sandusky, 33, was now willing to testify that the man he first met through the Second Mile charity repeatedly molested him while he was a child, according to Matt Sandusky's lawyers. The revelation kept Jerry Sandusky from taking the stand in his own defense. Sandusky's son fits pattern of other alleged victims . Portions of a 29-minute interview police had with Matt Sandusky during the middle of the trial were broadcast Tuesday on NBC, which obtained the audiotape. Jurors never heard the tape. Detectives asked Matt Sandusky why he was now willing to cooperate. ""I mean for my family so that they can really have closure and see what the truth actually is,"" Matt Sandusky said. ""And just to right the wrong, honestly, of going to the grand jury and lying."" In the police interview, Matt Sandusky said that he was molested between the ages of 8 and 15, that he tried to escape from the Sandusky home and once attempted suicide. ""I know that I really wanted to die at that point and time,"" he said, according to the audio obtained by NBC News. Matt Sandusky, a foster child formally adopted at 18, also described Jerry Sandusky rubbing, hugging and showering with him. ""If you were pretending you were asleep and if you were touched or rubbed in some way you could just act like you were rolling over in your sleep, so that you could change positions,"" said Matt Sandusky. The defendant would sometimes rub near and against his genitals, he told police. The potential witness said he could not recall penetration or oral sex. It was only days before the commonwealth rested, and after some alleged victims had testified, according to Matt Sandusky's lawyers, that he told them he was abused and wanted to cooperate with prosecutors. The younger Sandusky's willingness to testify as a rebuttal witness created a dilemma for Jerry Sandusky's defense team. They wanted their client to testify after the jury heard damning testimony from eight alleged victims, but they decided it against it. Attorney: Sandusky to appeal child sex abuse convictions . ""To put Jerry on the stand and have Matt come in and testify against him it would destroy any chance of an acquittal,"" co-defense counsel Joe Amendola told reporters Friday night after his client was convicted of 45 of 48 sexual abuse charges against him. Amendola said that Jerry Sandusky, 68, denied ever having inappropriate contact with Matt. By not putting Jerry Sandusky on the stand, the defense ensured that Matt Sandusky would not testify. The younger Sandusky's attorneys, Justine Andronici and Andrew Shubin, released a statement about the recording. ""This tape demonstrates Matt's tremendous courage and strength as he begins to disclose that Jerry Sandusky sexually abused him when he was a child,"" they said. ""Although the tape was released without Matt's knowledge or permission, it illustrates that he made the difficult decision to come forward and tell the painful truth to investigators despite extraordinary pressure to support his father."" The audiotape's leak was the main subject of a meeting hastily called Tuesday by trial Judge John Cleland and attended by prosecutors, defense attorneys and even the judge who has overseen the grand jury that's investigated the Sandusky case, a source with knowledge of the meeting told CNN National Correspondent Susan Candiotti. No one at the meeting took responsibility for sharing the tape with the media, the source told CNN. Jerry Sandusky's defense team was asked to turn over its copy of the tape, but it will remain available to them. Cleland ordered that any discovery turned over to the defense in the Sandusky case be sealed unless it was put into evidence at trial. He also said defense attorneys shall give a sworn statement within 10 days as to what materials they received and who they have given it to. The judge is trying to protect the current investigation and the privacy of the victims and witnesses. Neither prosecutors nor defense attorneys, who have vowed an appeal, would comment on Tuesday's meeting. Matt Sandusky's grand jury testimony remains a secret. Amendola said months ago he was not concerned about what the man said before the grand jury. Karl Rominger, another defense attorney, had a jailhouse visit with Jerry Sandusky on Monday. ""I'm innocent,"" said Jerry Sandusky, in answer to questions CNN's Candiotti asked of him through his lawyer. ""I didn't do it,"" he said, according to Rominger. Sex abusers prey on kids' trust, thrive on shame and fear, experts say . Rominger says Sandusky was bothered he didn't get to testify. But Jerry Sandusky doesn't regret his decision, according to his lawyer. Sandusky, who was allowed Monday to call his wife, Dottie, is not allowed visitors until a psychiatric examination is completed that also will determine whether he remains on suicide watch, according to Rominger. ""Some of the guards are friendly and will talk with him. Others don't talk to him at all,"" according to Rominger. Sandusky is allowed out of the small cell -- which features a toilet, sink and bed -- once a day to take a shower. ""He's come up with exercises to keep active,"" his lawyer told CNN. ""Enough to work up a sweat."" InSession's Jessica Thill contributed to this report.","NBC News obtains audiotape of police interview with Matt Sandusky .

"(CNN) -- Blame Canada, and especially Typhoon Neoguri: Next week isn't going to feel very much like summer in parts of the United States. Lows in the 40s will bring out the blankets in parts of the Upper Midwest as temperatures dip 10 to 20 degrees below normal. Other regions also will be a little cooler, if not as drastically. Why? Neoguri, the storm that hit Japan this week, made the jet stream wavier than usual, and starting Monday, the stream will dip into the Midwest, allowing cool Canadian air to drop south, CNN meteorologist Indra Petersons said. A sampling: . • Marquette, Michigan, could see a low of 45 on Tuesday morning, and it might reach only 58 on Monday and 57 on Tuesday -- a departure from July averages in the mid-70s. • Minneapolis, which is used to July highs in the mid-80s, might get up to 65 on Monday, 70 on Tuesday and 75 on Wednesday. • Chicago could see highs of 78 on Monday, 67 on Tuesday and 72 on Wednesday. Highs in the mid-80s are average. Outside the Midwest, the weather won't be particularly cool, but it won't be scorching, either: . • Washington will be baking on Monday (93) but might get up to only 81 on Wednesday. • New York City could see highs of 81 on Tuesday and 78 on Wednesday. • Charlotte, North Carolina, which is used to July highs in the upper 80s, should be in the low 80s Wednesday.","Parts of the Upper Midwest will see lows in the 40s next week .

"(CNN) -- Jenni Rivera is being mourned as the Diva of Banda, after the musical superstar died Sunday in a plane crash in Mexico. She built a recording and performing career, several businesses and a devoted following -- and her life was as full of the ups and the downs as any of the characters she sang about. She was born 43 years ago in Long Beach, California, to Mexican parents Rosa and Pedro Rivera who named her Jenny Dolores Rivera Saavedra. In an interview with CNN en Español in 2010, Rivera spoke about how she once sold cans for scrap metal and hawked music records at her family's stand at a Los Angeles flea market. When she was just 15 and a high school student she became a mother herself, giving birth to her first child, Janney ""Chiquis"" Marin Rivera in 1985. She then had two more children -- Jacqueline Marín Rivera and Michael Marín Rivera -- with her then-husband, José Trinidad Marín. Rivera spoke about how Marín physically abused her because while she wanted to attend college, he wanted her to quit school and be at home ""cooking and cleaning."" She said she grew up with four brothers so she knew how to fight back. They divorced in 1992 when Rivera found out Marín molested their daughter, Janney, and Rivera's younger sister, Rosie. Marín was convicted in 2006 and sentenced to 30 years in prison. Divorced and on welfare with three children, Rivera worked in real estate and took a second job at her father's record label, Cintas Acuario, which led to her passion and career in Regional/Banda/Norteño music. Since the release of her groundbreaking debut album ""La Chacalosa"" in 1995, Rivera has released more than 12 hit albums, all reaching Platinum and Gold status in the U.S. and Mexico. Her heart-wrenching ballads often center on infidelity, social issues and relationships. One of her independent albums was ""Farewell to Selena,"" a tribute album to slain singer Selena that helped expand her following. Rivera married Juan López in 1997 and had two children with him: Jenicka and Johnny López Rivera. They divorced in 2003, and he then died in 2009. Then in 2010, Rivera married baseball player Esteban Loaiza but they filed for divorce earlier this year. Perhaps it was her personal struggles that made Rivera known not only for her music but for her strong, resilient attitude when faced with adversity. ""In Mexico, she represented a lot of ladies that can't talk about their feelings,"" Jose ""Pepe"" Garza, Rivera's godfather and friend of the family, told CNN en Espanol. ""The public feels represented by Jenni Rivera, and by the lyrics of her songs."" Garza is very well-known within the banda and norteña music genres and has worked with other big artists in the regional Latin music. He also gave Rivera her big break. Rivera was also a woman of many firsts. She became the first artist to sell-out two back-to-back nights at the Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles, California, in 2010. And she was the first female Banda artist to sell-out a concert at the Gibson Amphitheater in Universal City, California. The business mogul also started companies including: Divina Realty, Divina Cosmetics, Jenni Rivera Fragrance, Jenni Jeans, Divine Music and The Jenni Rivera Love Foundation. Rivera made her film debut at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival with the indie family drama Filly Brown, set to be in theaters in January 2013. Her fan base was only expected to grow with a show in development with ABC, confirmed a source with knowledge of the deal to CNN Entertainment. A multi-camera family comedy, according to Deadline, was expected to star Rivera as a strong, middle-class, single Latina woman working to raise a family, struggling to run a family business and manage her extended family -- all while fighting the cultural perception that she needed a man to do it all. ""It is very flattering when they tell me I'm a great artist and performer,"" said Rivera in a 2010 interview with CNN en Espanol. ""But I am a businesswoman, I'm primarily business-minded."" Breaking into a male-dominated music genre was not easy, but Rivera made it look that way with her endless perseverance. ""I think she just did it with her pantelones, and you need a big personality to do it. She's been through so much,"" said Damarys Ocana, executive editor of Latina magazine, in an interview with CNN, ""She's been a victim, but never thought of herself as a victim."" The drama that surrounded Rivera's life received just as much attention as her successful, career but that never stopped her from being a ""mama bear to her five kids,"" said Ocana. Family always came first for Rivera. Flashback: Jenni Rivera reflects on her success . In May 2011, Latina magazine put both Jenni and Janney Rivera on their cover, the first time the magazine put two people on the cover. ""We put both of them on the cover because they were the stars of 'I Love Jenni' and the show was doing incredibly well on Mun2,"" said Ocana. Rivera also spent part of her life volunteering at the Love Foundation, an organization that promotes programs to support immigrants, children with cancer, women victims of violence, reports CNN Mexico. In 2010, the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence named Rivera as their spokesperson. Photos: Singer Jenni Rivera . Speaking on the U.S. Senate floor Monday afternoon, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida described Rivera as ""a real American success story."" ""She was a singer in a genre of music that's largely dominated by males, and she brought a powerful voice to that genre where she sang frankly about her struggles to give her children a better life in this country,"" he said. Universal Music Group also released a statement, saying: ""The entire Universal Music Group family is deeply saddened by the sudden loss of our dear friend Jenni Rivera. The world rarely sees someone who has had such a profound impact on so many. From her incredibly versatile talent to the way she embraced her fans around the world, Jenni was simply incomparable. Her talent will be missed; but her gift of music will be with us always."" Also believed aboard the plane were her publicist, Arturo Rivera, her lawyer, makeup artist, Jacob Yebale, and the flight crew. ""It's hard to accept. It's painful. I cry,"" said Rivera's brother Gustavo Rivera in an interview with CNN en Espanol, ""But the support from the fans is consoling to us."" She told CNN in 2010 that she wouldn't let scandals or personal tragedy stop her. ""Staying defeated, crying and suffering was not an option,"" she said. ""I had to get off my feet, dust myself off and press on. That's what I want to teach my daughters."" In an interview with the Immigrant Archive Project she said: . ""If I had the opportunity to speak to a young immigrant girl that just arrived to the U.S. the advice I would have for her would be: ask, speak, search; because there are opportunities out there. And, know that you aren't the only immigrant or the last to come to this country. Many that have come before you have succeeded. It is possible."" Jenni Rivera is survived by her parents, Rosa and Pedro, three other siblings: Pedro Jr., Gustavo and Rosie; and her five children: Janney, Jacqueline, Michael, Jenicka and Johnny. Journalist Jaqueline Hurtado, Catherine Shoichet and Rafael Romo contributed to this report.","Sen. Marco Rubio calls Rivera ""a real American success story""

"London (CNN) -- A Pablo Picasso painting given to the Greek people in recognition of their resistance to Nazi occupation during World War II has been stolen from the National Art Gallery in Athens. ""Head of a Woman,"" painted in 1939, was among three works taken in the early morning heist on Monday, the authorities said. A fourth work was dropped by the thief, or thieves, during their getaway. The Picasso portrait, which depicts a woman in a white blouse against a blue background, is inscribed on the reverse: ""For the Greek people, a tribute from Picasso."" It was donated by the artist in 1946. Greek police say the raider, or raiders, also made off with Piet Mondrian's ""Landscape with a mill,"" and a pen-and-ink sketch of San Diego de Alcala in ecstasy by Renaissance artist Guglielmo Caccia. ""Landscape with a farm,"" a second figurative painting by Dutch artist Mondrian -- who is better known for his abstract works -- was left behind as the burglar ran away. Officers say the intruder, or intruders, interfered with the alarm system several times overnight, setting it off repeatedly so that it was disabled by the museum guards. At about 4.30am local time (06:30 GMT), the raider(s) broke into the gallery's temporary exhibition area through an aluminum-framed door on a balcony. During the theft, a motion detector was activated, alerting a guard who chased one thief, but was unable to catch him. The raid led Citizen's Protection Minister Christos Papoutsis to criticize security at the gallery, which is home to works by Auguste Rodin, Henri Matisse and Peter Paul Rubens. ""I am very sorry because an artwork of huge value was stolen,"" news agency Agence France-Presse quoted Papoutsis as saying. ""This incident should prompt a re-evaluation of the National Gallery's security arrangements."" Athens' National Art Gallery showcases works from the 14th to the 20th centuries, and is best known for its collections of Greek and Renaissance art, including paintings by El Greco, Tiepolo and Brueghel. The theft took place on the final day of an exhibition entitled ""Unknown Treasures,"" which had featured prints and etchings by Albrecht Duerer and Rembrandt van Rijn.","Paintings by Picasso, Mondrian stolen in raid on National Art Gallery in Athens .

"(CNN) -- Zimbabweans are voting in a hotly-contested election as President Robert Mugabe seeks to extend power for a further five years. Mugabe, 89, has been at the helm since 1980, and is the only leader the nation has known since it gained independence from Britain. The polls are expected to end an uneasy coalition government formed after violence broke out when Mugabe claimed victory in the last election five years ago. The post-election violence left 200 people dead and thousands more injured, according to rights groups. Is Zimbabwe ready for elections? Depends on who you ask . What do we need to know about these elections? They are taking place under a new constitution endorsed in a March referendum that limits the president to two five-year terms. Mugabe is allowed to seek another term because the rule does not apply retroactively. Results are expected within five days. To be declared winner, a candidate needs to win more than 50% of the vote. If that doesn't happen, a run-off will be held on September 11. Who is running for president? The head of state Robert Mugabe, the 89-year-old leader of Zanu-PF, is seeking to extend his 33-year rule. His main rival is the current Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai, who helped form the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) in 1999. Tsvangirai, 61, hopes to become president after three failed attempts. There are three other candidates: Welshman Ncube, the current industry and commerce minister and president of the Movement for Democratic Change; Dumiso Dabengwa, leader of the Zimbabwe African People's Union (Zapu), and Kisinoti Munodei Mukwazhe, who represents the small Zimbabwe Development Party (ZDP). Who is Robert Mugabe? Mugabe, born in 1924 in the south of Rhodesia, spent his early career as a teacher. Drawn to the struggle for independence, he fled the country in the early 1960s, only to be jailed for 10 years on his return in 1964. On his release he formed Zanu-PF, which he led from neighboring Mozambique. The conflict came at the same time as the ANC in South Africa, led by Nelson Mandela, engaged in its struggle to overthrow apartheid, a cause that drew strong support from Mugabe and his followers. In 1980, Mugabe became prime minister of the newly formed Zimbabwe, and he assumed the position of president in 1987. A Wikileaks cable released in 2011 claiming Mugabe had prostate cancer was dismissed by his party. What problems has Zimbabwe faced? Mugabe's liberation credentials held him in good stead during the early part of his leadership, with many seeing him as a politician who could unite a country that had been divided through civil conflict. But in 2000 he drew criticism for his land reform program, when white farmers were evicted from their land, which was given to poor black Zimbabweans, many of them veterans of the struggle for independence with limited knowledge of commercial farming. Soon, agricultural output began to decrease sharply. Overseas, Mugabe's relationship with nations beyond southern Africa became rocky. In December 2003 Zimbabwe withdrew from the Commonwealth, the organization of the United Kingdom and predominantly her former colonies. Five years later the UK government stripped Mugabe of the honorary knighthood he had been awarded by Queen Elizabeth II. The European Union imposed sanctions on Mugabe and his allies over its human rights record. By 2008 inflation in Zimbabwe had soared to 200 million percent. Food shelves were empty, international isolation continued to hit the economy, and corruption was rife. Mugabe failed to win enough votes in the March 2008 presidential vote to retake office. His main opponent, Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), withdrew from the presidential run-off vote scheduled for June 2008, alleging Mugabe supporters had used violence and intimidation. Scores of opposition party supporters were beaten, tortured and killed. A power-sharing agreement was eventually signed in September 2008, but a government of national unity was only formed in February 2009, after Tsvangirai was sworn in as prime minister. How is Zimbabwe's economy doing at the moment? In 2009, the country's unemployment rate stood at 94% according to the CIA. However, since 2009, Zimbabwe's economy has started to recover from a decade-long crisis. The value of mineral exports increased by 230% during 2009-2011, while the value of agricultural exports increased by 101% during the same period. Growth in 2011 was led by strong growth in mining (50.5%), agriculture (17.1%) and services (16.3%), according to the World Bank. Zimbabwe's economy recorded real growth of more than 9% per year in 2010-11, before slowing to 5% in 2012, mainly because of a poor harvest and low diamond revenues. But poverty in Zimbabwe is still widespread, food shortages affect many parts of the country, and corruption is rife.

"(CNN) -- It may be a time of fasting, but the Muslim holy month of Ramadan can also be a time of indulgence. (Ramadan begins this year on June 28 or 29, depending on which part of the world is observing.) In several countries, there's a tendency toward overeating as the traditional light dawn meal, the suhoor, and post-fast iftar get super-sized. In Dubai, health warnings are issued -- cases of diabetes and chronic indigestion have been known to spiral. For those who can control their appetites and savor the experience, there's a lavish world to be enjoyed in Bedouin-like tents laid on by luxury hotels in the United Arab Emirates. These elaborately decorated pool, beach or desert-side pitches compete with each other for Ramadan tent wow factor. Some mega-tents seat hundreds. Live cooking stations and superstar Lebanese performers are all part of the fasting-to-feasting scene. So are shisha parlors -- where revelers smoke multi-flavored tobacco with the hookah or hubble bubble water pipe. These are some of the best under-canvas candidates. Kempinski Hotel Palm Jumeirah (Dubai) Despite the luxury location on Dubai's palm tree-shaped island, this is less of a glittery taste-fest and more a traditional at-home celebration. Albeit in a very swanky home. Diners can recline in the tiered Ottoman-style seating areas or swan about the terrace with garden glimpses over the lagoon. Energy-rich substances dominate the Ramadan menu including assafiri, a sweet crepe filled with an Arabic cream. Dried fruits and nuts also take center stage. Dates are Ramadan royalty, with some 400 varieties eaten during the festivities -- molded by chefs into pyramids and other eye-catching culinary arrangements. Kempinski Palm Jumeirah, Crescent West, Palm Jumeirah; +971 4 444 2501; open to hotel guests only . Atlantis The Palm (Dubai) Tahina addicts take note: a showpiece of the white billowy-walled Asateer Tent at the Atlantis Palm Jumeirah is a fountain from which the sesame paste flows like Niagara Falls. Big enough for 900 eaters, the tent spreads along the beachfront and features a mod Oriental decor of strawberry sofas and oval lights. Chocolate-coated dates, macaroons and other iftar treats peer from alcoves of minaret-shaped cake displays. A towering construction of Turkish delight, nougat, Emirati dates and baklava tops off the sweet intake. Jumbo-sized Arabic coffee pots loom over mosaic-patterned brass cooking stations where chefs whip up lamb with spiced rice, and fish with caramelized onions. Those who manage to tear themselves away from the food can dabble with PlayStation consoles, traditional Arabic board games and free Wi-Fi. Atlantis The Palm, Crescent Road, Palm Jumeirah; +971 4 426 0800 . Madinat Jumeirah (Dubai) It's a less family-oriented affair at the Arabian coastal resort of Madinat Jumeirah's Al Majilis tent. No one under 21 years old is allowed in. Beneath a massive shimmering star chandelier, dripping with hundreds of diamond-cut crystal beads, the tent's creamy fixtures are set within golden Moorish arches and Jali latticework. Around the walls, more intimate raised seating areas are soft lit with pendant lights. The suhoor experience is particularly chilled out. Crisply presented mezze and salads of crumbled Lebanese cheese balls, onion, olive oil and parsley are delivered by waiters in red fez hats. Fresh tamarind drinks and beverages are made from fermented barley, vegetable juices and warm infusions of rosemary, fennel and mint to ward off indigestion. Al Majilis, Madinat Jumeirah, Jumeirah Beach Road; +971 366 6730 . World Trade Center (Dubai) This elegant Arabesque venue is a world away from the fashionable hotel crowd who talk of ""apres Iftar"" lounging on beachfront hotel sofas. Here the contemporary souk atmosphere of carved trellis tables, white sofas and golden brass lanterns is crowned by a constellation of ceiling lights, casting a blue night light over the gazebo. The award-winning buffet of 50-plus dishes includes Ramadan staples such as kibbeh meatballs in yogurt sauce, vegetarian potato kibbeh, grilled meats and halloumi cheese infused with fresh thyme. This iftar is considered reasonably priced at $38 compared to the standard $50-60 charged by luxury hotels. The WTC also offers mini majlises for private celebrations.

The Mega Tent's menu takes three months to prepare and 150 chefs to deliver. As the sun sets, fasters descend on the marquee to graze on hot and cold mezze, goat with Oriental rice, kebab with saffron and herbs and the energy-bolstering apricot Ramadan drink Qamar al Din. Many iftar essentials are super sweet. Kunafa is a cream-filled pastry drowned with pistachios and sugar syrup; qatayef, sometimes called Arabian pancakes, are filled with walnuts or white cheese and then fried and dipped in orange blossom syrup. Mega Tent, Emirates Palace, W. Corniche Road, Abu Dhabi; +971 2 690 9000 . Bab Al Shams Desert Resort (Dubai) A Disneyesque version of the true Arabian tent experience can be found in the sand dunes. No matter if July temperatures rise toward their usual 108 F (42 C), this tent is climate controlled. Food from the dune-side cooking stations might be spicy but the hotel says guests can ""chill"" inside, entertained by musicians and whirling Sufi-style Tanoura dancers. Out in a courtyard resembling an Arabian fort and decked out with palms, flickering candles and stained glass lanterns, a gang of cooks whips up regional specialties including barbecued meats, grilled fish, chicken, hot breads and baklava. On the rooftop lounge overlooking the desert, guests can watch belly dancers, Arabian horse shows and camel caravans fading into the desert haze. Bab Al Shams Desert Resort, Dubai; +971 4 809 6194 .

The Emirates Red Crescent dishes up 800,000 free iftar meals in 112 tents across the UAE during Ramadan.

"(CNN) -- Three people were shot to death in Chicago on Friday and Saturday, one week after a spate of Fourth of July violence left nine dead in the city. Chicago Police Department News Affairs Officer Veejay Zala said the most recent death occurred when a man, 28, was shot in the back on West Devon Avenue about 3:20 p.m. Saturday. Police said he was standing on the street when an unknown person killed him. That killing may be gang-related, Zala said. On Friday, a 27-year-old man was killed and a woman wounded in domestic violence on South Rockwell Street, he said. Also Friday, a man, 32, was killed on West Quincy Street in a possible drive-by shooting, Zala said. Over the Fourth of July weekend, nine people were killed and more than 60 wounded, police said. Chicago Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy said in eight incidents, police fired guns at suspects or were fired upon. In two incidents, police shot and killed the suspects, both of whom were 16, he said.
